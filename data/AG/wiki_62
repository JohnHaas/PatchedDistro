HMS Cicero (F170)

HMS "Cicero" was an infantry landing ship in service with the Royal Navy during the late stages of the Second World War.
Career.
Wartime.
She was built by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Wilmington, California as the "Cape St Vincent", and transferred under the terms of lend lease shortly after being completed in January 1944 under the name "Empire Arquebus". She was taken over by the Ministry of War Transport and operated by Donaldson Bros & Black Ltd. "Empire Arquebus" was a member of Convoy CU 15, which sailed from New York on 22 February 1944. She was carrying a cargo of fish and personnel. "Empire Arquebus" transferred to Convoy HX 280 at sea on 29 February. Convoy HX 280 arrived at Liverpool on 9 March.
She took part in the Normandy Landings, carrying Mk3 LCS (M)'s 78, 109 and 112 of the 542 LCA Flotilla and troops from the Royal Hampshire Regiment. After the Normandy Landings, "Empire Arquebus" was laid up in the Clyde. "Empire Arquebus" later served in the Pacific.
In January 1945 she was requisitioned by the Admiralty and commissioned as HMS "Cicero", under which name she served out the remainder of the war, although it would appear that she remained named as "Empire Arquebus". In 1945, "Empire Arquebus" was used to transport troops from Sydney and Brisbane via New Ireland, New Britain and Manus to Ponam. During this journey, the ship was infested by flying beetles which had got aboard in bales of tobacco. The ship arrived at Ponam on 25 March 1945. Surplus to requirements after its end, she was returned to the Ministry of War Transport in September 1945, which returned her to Donaldson Bros & Black under her original name of "Empire Arquebus".
Postwar.
"Empire Arquebus" sailed with Donaldson Bros & Black until 1946, when she was returned to the US Navy. She was laid up until being sold to the Egyptian company Société Misr de Navigation Maritime in November 1946, taking the new name "Al Sudan". She sailed with them for the next few years, making voyages carrying pilgrims to Jeddah, and at times operating under charter. She made a number of voyages to Australia.
She was taken over by the Egyptian Government in 1959, during the period of nationalisation, and by 1961 was part of the nationalised United Arab Maritime Company, who proceeded to operate her for the next 12 years. In 1973 she returned to being owned by an Egyptian company, this time the Egyptian Navigation Company. She was sold for scrapping in 1980, and laid up at Suez. She spent several years in this state, but work was finally started in July 1984 and she was completely broken up by 28 March 1987.
Official number and code letters.
Official Numbers were a forerunner to IMO Numbers.
"Empire Arquebus" had the UK Official Number 169819 and used the Code Letters MYMS. "Al Sudan" had the Egyptian Official Number 104 and used the Code Letters SUDS.

Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church

Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church was founded in 1886 and was the first black Baptist church organized in Winter Park, Florida, United States. Originally, the church began at the home of Reverend Charles and Mrs. Missouri Ambrose on Pennsylvania Avenue in the town's predominantly African American Westside.
The church presented the community with a safe place to form close friendships, and offered a number of wholesome activities for children and adults. Clyde W. Hall, a member of the church, recalls that “the church also provided a place where African-Americans could dress in their best attire on Sundays and enjoy equality without encountering the racial deprivations of everyday living in the South at that time.”
The first minister to lead the congregation was Reverend Charles Johnson Smith, who came to Mount Moriah in 1887. Reverend Smith’s position as a moderator of the First Florida Missionary Baptist Association helped allow the developing church to be granted membership in the organization in 1910. Reverend Smith continued to serve Mount Moriah until 1911.
History.
From the time of its founding in 1886 until 1935, membership in Mt. Moriah grew. “Soon the Ambroses' home could no longer accommodate the number of people attending the church. So, until the church had a building of its own, it held meetings on alternate Sundays at the Winter Park Town Hall".
On March 16, 1888, the trustees of Mt. Moriah purchased lots one and three of block 70 from the Winter Park Company for a church site. These lots, located on the southwest corner of West Lyman and Pennsylvania Avenues, are the home of two church buildings. “On April 26, 1912, Mt. Moriah Baptist Church also purchased for $165.00 from Charles and Helen Morse of Chicago, Illinois Lot Thirteen in Block Sixty-nine to locate a parsonage on West Comstock Avenue".
“In 1935, the funds from the estate of William A Coursen enabled Mt. Moriah to build its present sanctuary. The edifice was built at a cost of $8,500. Rev. I.C. Nimmons, the Church’s seventh pastor, provided leadership over the building project. Rev. Nimmons instituted the first Missionary Society, the Junior Church, and the Junior Choir". Construction of the new church building was performed by the African-American Ford Construction Company of Orlando. Since many local citizens were employed by this company, the assembly of the building helped bring the community together and stir up enthusiasm for the new chapel.
William A. Coursen was a graduate of Princeton University and an established citizen of Winter Park. In Coursen’s will he wished to have his estate auctioned off and the funds divided equally among several beneficiaries, including the Salvation Army, the Red Cross of Orlando, and the Public Library of Winter Park. Also, funds were allotted “to all the churches of Winter Park irrespective of creed, color or denomination any church home, the House of God". Following Coursen’s death in early 1934, each church in Winter Park (including the seven African-American churches) received a donation of approximately $8,500. “With this money every African-American Church in Winter Park built a new edifice in 1935 or 1936, except Wards Chapel A.M.E. Church who used its money to improve its present structure and purchase additional property".
The new building allowed the church and its programs to flourish. Between 1941 and 1946, under the leadership of Rev. L. A. Pelham (Mount Moriah’s eighth pastor), the church began conducting regular mass every Sunday. New church programs developed over the years which further increased community involvement in the church, such as the Young Adult Choir (organized in 1959) and the Junior Women Missionary Society (organized in 1971).
As of 2011, Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church is led by its 11th pastor, Rev. A. C. Cobb. “Like many Black churches across the nation, Mt. Moriah is facing an aging congregation and tackling the job of finding younger members". The church has a congregation of approximately 150 members, of which a large portion is over age 50.

Capirola Lutebook

The so-called Capirola Lutebook is one of the most important sources of early 16th century Italian lute music. It is an illuminated manuscript which comprises the entire surviving output of Vincenzo Capirola.
The Capirola Lutebook was compiled in 1520 by Vitale, a pupil of Capirola. The compositions included probably date from around 1517. There are 72 folios; the manuscript begins with a short note by its creator, one Vitale (Vidal), pupil of Capirola's. Vitale informs the reader that he adorned the lutebook with paintings to ensure its survival: even owners not interested in musical matters would, by Vitale's reasoning, keep the lutebook in their collections because of the paintings. This explanation is followed by a substantial text on lute playing technique, ornaments and notation—one of the most important sources on performance practice of the time. The actual music starts at folio 5. The lutebook contains the following works (for intabulations, composers of vocal originals are given):
The music varies in difficulty from very easy pieces (intended, as Vitale observes, for teaching purposes) to virtuosic toccata-like works. The thirteen ricercars of the book stylistically stand between the earliest, improvisatory examples and Francesco da Milano's ricercars, which exhibit a more advanced imitative technique. The manuscript is notable not only for the place Capirola occupies in lute repertoire, but also for the earliest known dynamic indications: for instance, the indication "tocca pian piano" appears in "Non ti spiaqua l'ascoltar". However, Capirola's seems to be an isolated example.

Mountain Landscape with Rainbow

Mountain Landscape with Rainbow (1809-10) (), is an oil painting by the German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich. Like the "Riesengebirge Landscape" (1810) this painting was inspired by Friedrich's 1809 travels through Germany and along the shores of the Baltic Sea. The observation of nature in his travels allowed Friedrich to compose a universal, idyllic landscape that is visionary rather than literal. 
In the foreground a wayfarer has stopped to rest. He turns his gaze to the background, where a black abyss opens up. In those depths a few mountains can be glimpsed. Above the landscape, a rainbow forms in the waning light.
In Friedrich's oeuvre, paintings with a sharp contrast between the foreground and background are common, a separation symbolizing the spiritual and physical planes of existence. So it is in this painting: in the foreground the sun illuminates the foliage and the clothes of the traveller, and in contrast the darkness of night fills the rest of the image. The opposites of day and night, and of spirit and matter, are unified by a rainbow, which in the Genesis account of Noah's ark symbolized the covenant between God and humanity.

During their performance Metallica performed the songs "Last Caress" and "So What?" instead of performing their single "King Nothing" as scheduled. The MTV executives told the band that they weren't allowed to use any curse words during their time on live TV, and upset with the scripted, family-friendly MTV antics, Metallica simply played non-TV friendly songs. The song "So What?" is known for its amount of expletives and references to Bestiality among many other controversial lyrics while "Last Caress" has lyrics pertaining to murder and rape. As a result of their performance Metallica's performance and references to Metallica have been removed from future broadcasts of the ceremony.

2009 League of Ireland

The 2009 League of Ireland season consists of the League of Ireland Premier Division, the League of Ireland First Division and the Newstalk A Championship. The Premier Division and First Division seasons began on 6 March 2009, while the A Championship commenced on 4 April 2009. Bohemians were the defending Premier Division champions.
On 6 November 2009, Bohemians retained the title after a 1-1 draw against Bray Wanderers.
Changes from last season.
Promotion and relegation.
Finn Harps, Cobh Ramblers and UCD were relegated to the First Division for finishing in the last three places of the 2008 Premier Division. Cobh Ramblers were only awarded an A licence by the Licencing board, and thus play in the A Championship. Dundalk won the First Division in 2008 and were promoted to the Premier Division. This season is the first to include a completely professional Premier Division, after the promotion of Dundalk and relegation of Finn Harps, Cobh Ramblers and UCD.
Kildare County and Mervue United competed in a two-legged play-off for one spot in the First Division. Mervue United won 5–2 on aggregate and therefore earned promotion to the First Division, while Kildare County were due to compete in the A Championship, but take Cobh Ramblers' place in the First Division.
Castlebar Celtic, Dundalk A, FC Carlow, Sporting Fingal A and Tralee Dynamos joined the A Championship, while Cobh Ramblers A, Limerick FC A and University College Dublin A withdrew.
Structural changes.
The Premier Division was reduced from twelve to ten teams. In turn, the First Division increased its size from ten to twelve teams. Hence the promotion/relegation scheme between both divisions was modified as well. In contrast to 2008, only the last-placed team of the Premier Division will be directly relegated to the First Division. The First Division champions will be promoted to the Premier Division. The eight-placed and ninth-placed Premier Division teams will play in a one-legged play-off (at the ground of the eight-placed club) with the loser entering into a two-legged play-off for one spot in Premier Division 2010. The opponents in this two-legged play-off will be the winners of a one-legged play-off between the runners-up and third-placed in the First Division (with the runners-up being at home).
The A Championship was increased from 16 teams to 18. These teams are geographically divided into two groups of 9. The two group winners will play off in the title decider on 2 November 2009. The highest placed non-reserve team, provided they finish in the top 3, will play a two-legged play-off against the bottom team of the First Division.
Name change.
Limerick 37 now play as Limerick F.C. which was also the name of a separate club previously from Limerick which played in the League of Ireland.
League.
Rules.
Procedure.
There are ten participating clubs in the Premier Division and twelve participating clubs in the First Division for 2009. During the course of the 2009 season each Premier club play their respective others four times, for a total of 36 matches per team. First Division sides play each other three times throughout the season for a total of 33 matches per team. A pre-season draw decided which clubs have the benefit of two home games in these matches. The A Championship contains six first team sides and the reserve sides from Premier Division and some First Division clubs, for a total of 18 clubs.
Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference and then goals scored. If there is equality in points, goal difference and goals for tallies, the clubs involved must partake in a play-off to decide their finishing positions.
Qualification for 2010–11 European competitions.
According to the domestic league coefficients earned during last five years, Republic of Ireland ended up in 30th place among 53 European national football associations. This means that the top team in the Premier Division will qualify for the second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. The second-placed team, as well as the winners of the domestic FAI Cup, will qualify for the second, while the third-placed team will qualify for the first qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League.
If it were to happen that cup-winners have already qualified for the UEFA Europa League via the league, the cup-win qualification will take prominence and the league-place qualification will be transferred to the next team who finished below them in the league. However, if the case is that the cup-winner has already won the league, that team will take a place in the UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds, by way of its league-win. The cup-winner spot will then be awarded to the second-placed team, with the third-placed team and the cup final losers (or the fourth-placed team if the cup losers finish second or third in the league) taking the original spots from the league.

UEFA Champions League.
After winning the 2008 Premier Division, Bohemians represented the league in the Champions League. Thanks to the league's vast improvement in European competition over the past five seasons the Irish club started in the Second Qualifying Round. However they were not seeded and were given a tough tie with Austrian champions Red Bull Salzburg. Despite being underdogs going into the tie, they produced a wonderful performance in the away leg and went back to Dublin with a slight advantage after getting a 1-1 draw. 85 minutes into the home leg and with Bohs apparently going through, disaster struck as Janko headered in an 87th minute winner for the Austrians which knocked Bohs out of Europe.
UEFA Europa League.
Sligo Rovers were the first to represent the league in 2009, as they were in the first qualifying round. They got a good draw with Albanian side Vllaznia however an unbelievable home leg ended up 2-1 to the Albanians. Sligo failed to recover in the away leg, drawing 1-1 and so were knocked out of Europe at the first attempt.
St Patrick's Athletic and Derry City started into the second qualifying round. In the first leg St Pats drew 1-1 at home with Maltese side Valletta and Derry City drew 1-1 with Skonto Riga in Latvia. A good second leg saw both qualify for the next round, with Pats winning 1-0 in Malta and Derry beating Skonto 1-0 at the Brandywell.
In the next round St Pats were drawn against Russian club Krylia Sovetov Samara. They were not fancied to get through, however they won the first leg at Richmond Park 1-0. There were higher hopes for Derry against CSKA Sofia of Bulgaria but they lost the first leg 1-0. Despite their best efforts in the second leg, they could only manage a 1-1 draw and so were knocked out. St Pats also seemed to be heading out as they were 3-0 down to Krylia Sovetov in Russia with just twenty minutes remaining, but Declan O'Brien struck twice to send them through on the away goals tule.
In the last round before the groups stages, St Pats were drawn against Romanian giants Steaua Bucharest, who in the previous round had hammered Scottish club Motherwell 6-1. It didn't look good for Pats but at half time in the away leg they had held them scoreless. In the second half however they found their scoring touch and ran out comfortable 3-0 winners. Steaua expected an easy match in Dublin, however on 48 minutes Pats went ahead and a minute later hit the post from a free-kick. Steaua recovered their composure however and won 2-1, thus knocking out Ireland's last team in European competition in 2009. Despite falling in the final round, Pats were acknowledged by fellow league fans for their impressive displays in the competition throughout the summer.
UEFA Ranking.
The League of Ireland accumulated a respectable score of 1.375 co-efficient points for the season. After the 2009/10 season, Ireland ranked 29th in the co-efficient table, their highest placing since 1986.

Dalloyau

Dalloyau is a Paris-based food company whose history goes back to 1682 and the Versailles Court. Dalloyau is a family-owned and independent business, Nadine Gavillon-Bernardé is the current president since 1993. The company is member of the "Comité Colbert" since 2001. Dalloyau opened its first shop abroad in 1982 in Tokyo. In 2009, Dalloyau has 31 shops.
History.
In 1682, Charles Dalloyau, then serving the Prince of Condé, was noticed for his breads that Louis XIV tasted during a reception. Since then, Louis XIV hired Charles Dalloyau. Over four generations, the Dalloyau brothers all work at the Court and are part of the elite wearing the very prestigious title of "Officier de bouche", the highest French gastronomy distinction at the time. Thus, the Dalloyau brothers and sons were ennobled and could wear their sword in front of the King. Thanks to this highly prized title, they attend the King's meals, are invited to official ceremonies and participate to culinary and gastronomic researches. Then the French Revolution comes, shattering society. Sensing the coming evolutions and trends, Jean-Baptiste Dalloyau, descendant of Charles, continues the story of the Dalloyau dynasty and founds in 1802 "Dalloyau, house of gastronomy". He associates all activities linked to the art of well-eating, and offers to emergent bourgeoisie cooked meals to have a party at home, just like aristocrats used to do at the time.He settles in Paris, rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, the current address of Dalloyau's main Paris shop.
Opera Cake: Dalloyau's most famous pastry.
This cake was invented in 1955 by Cyriaque Gavillon from Dalloyau. He wanted to created a new cake shape with visible layers and for which only one bite would give the whole cake's taste. It is his spouse, Andrée Gavillon, that named it "Opéra" as a tribute to an Opera prima ballerina. The Opera is a rectangular cake composed of three thin layers of Joconde soaked in coffee syrup and garnished with coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache. The top is covered with a dark chocolate coating.

The Case STX Steiger is a tractorline built by Case IH. This line continues the models built by Steiger Tractor, which was purchased by Case IH in 1986.
The tractors are built in Case IH's plant in Fargo, North Dakota, where already 50,000 units of this line were built.
This tractor line is powered by engines with 368 hp (274 kW) to 589 hp (439 kW). They are available with Quadtracs or tires and are also available from New Holland as model TJ or T9000.
In 2007, the STX500 Quadtrac tractor was featured on the television series Top Gear, where presenter Richard Hammond chose the STX Steiger for some of the challenges, (eventually including ploughing.) It was lapped around the Top Gear Test Track by The Stig, finishing in a time of 4:49.1, which is the slowest lap ever round the track. In 2005 that model of tractor broke the 24 hour ploughing World Record, turning of farmland in just 24 hours.

Blueprintreview

"BluePrintReview" is an online magazine that publishes short stories, poetry, creative non-fiction and visual art.
Concept and Development.
The magazine was founded in May 2005 by the German author and web freelancer Dorothee Lang, who still edits it. Initially focused on experimental poetry and Flash fiction, it developed a broader spectrum over time. In June 2006, a first print issue was published: "the mo(nu)ment issue". At the same time, the Collaborative blog "Just a moment" became part of the magazine. 
Since the beginning, the concept of BluePrintReview is to explore unexpected connections between texts and images from unrelated places. 
In June 2008, BluePrintReview was reviewed by NewPages.com, and characterized as "an online journal constructed to ease the complex and beautiful convergence of language and art and all the possibilities this entails."
Stories first published in "BluePrintReview" have been included in the best of the net online anthology by Sundress Publications, and in the "Best of the Web"[http://www.dzancbooks.org/bow.html] anthology from Dzanc Books.
Focus Issue 22: Reprints and Retrieved Magazines.
Like most literary journals, BluePrintReview focuses on previously unpublished texts and images, yet includes the guideline note “reprints are fine, but please make sure to indicate this in the submission.”
In 2009, a pre-published text in issue 20 induced a mail discussion about the impact of magazine layouts on its content. The key line of this discussion: "“It’s fascinating how taking the same words, and framing them differently can lead to a very different emotional response - a different experience entirely.”"
From that discussion, the idea emerged to dedicate a whole blueprintreview issue to reprints, to explore the layout effect further. The issue itself has the theme “re /visit /cycle /turn”, it went live in October 2009, here the direct link: BluePrintReview #22. 
The reprint issue also addresses the in-limbo-situation of orphaned texts: texts that get published in an online publication that later goes offline, leaving the texts as pre-published (and thus difficult to place again), but at the same time as not present any more. (A file with detailed process notes of the reprint issue and copies of the mail conversations is online, here the link: Some Aspects of Reprints.)
Following the conversations, it seemed fitting to include some of those “orphaned texts” in the reprint issue – which lead to a surprise finding:
To be able to provide an original layout for orphaned magazines, too, and with it, a means to compare the texts in 2 different frames, the blueprintreview editor tried to trace the original layouts of the previously-online-magazines that first published those orphaned works. And, with the help of internet archives like the 'Waybackmachine', managed to dig up some of the original pages – and then ran into whole issues of magazines thought lost. 
This led to the idea to gather those “lost” links, first as literary blog notes, and later, with further input from blueprintreview contributors as well as from editors of other literary magazine, as “list of retrieved magazines” (a first version of the list is online here: Retrieved Online Literary Magazines.)
Issues.
One key element to BluePrintReview is that there are no given themes. Instead, each issue develops its own theme through submissions. 
Recent issues and their themes:
issue 23, January 2010: (dis)comfort zones
issue 22, October 2009: re /visit /cycle /turn

Iatromathematicians

Iatromathematicians (from Greek ἰατρική "medicine" and μαθηματικά "mathematics") were a school of physicians in 17th century Italy who tried to apply the laws of mathematics and mechanics in order to understand the functioning of the human body. They were also keen students of anatomy. These iantromathematicians made an effort to prove that applying a purely mechanical conception to the study of the human body is futile. The mechanical conceptions that they had referred to was Leonardo da Vinci’s studies of the human body, and the writings of Aristotle about the motion of animals related to geometric analysis. Iantromathematicians considered the bodies functioning to be measured by quantifiable numbers, weights, and measures. 
Iatromathematics.
The field of iatromathematics is allied to science; however, it lacks the applicability of the proper scientific method and is therefore considered a form of pseudoscience. It applies the study of astrology to medicine. 
Iatromathematicians viewed the human body through astrological reasoning as well as mechanics. They associate various stars, or zodiac signs with the functioning of the human body. The twelve astrological signs contribute to each part of the body from head to toe. Moreover, planets and existing cosmos in space are correlated with certain parts of the body. Through examining a natal chart, iatromathematicians attempt to predict biological setbacks in an individual.
Iatromathematicians examine the active and energetic temperament of the human body. Moreover, they explore the causes of various health problems and attempt to find ways to treat certain detrimental diseases. In iatromathematics, there is a particular assumption that there is an impact of various energetic fields caused on the star bodies. The star body of an individual is often referred to by astrologists as an energetic matrix and is believed to be spawned by heavenly bodies such as the sun, moon, planets, and several other astrological signs. 
Iatromathematicians study these conceptions and try to regulate the path of the star body of individuals so that it will give a positive, rather than a negative result. By doing so, they believe that it will contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Its doctrine is based on cosmobiology in which several emotional and physiological dilemmas in the body are associated with the positioning of celestial bodies in outer space. 
Iatromathematics is closely correlated with biomechanics because the field of biomechanics investigates macrobiotic bodies to a macroscopic degree through the appliance of several engineering principles. The perspective of iatromathematicians differed from that of iatrophysicists and iatrochemists in terms of the way human bodies function. Iatrophysicists predicted the deviations from the biological norm of the body through the appliance of physics, while iatrochemists measured the detrimental problems of the body by chemical means. 
Ibn Ezra.
Several individuals contributed to this field study of iatromathematics. For example, Ibn Ezra (Rabbi Avraham Ben Meir Ibn Ezra) wrote nine different astrological treatises. He covered all the subsections of astrology which include the branches of natal, medicinal, horary, electional, and mundane. Ibn Ezra’s best known work was known as "The Beginning of Wisdom". Over time, various individuals studied his works comprehensively. One such person was George Sarton, who is the founder of the History of Science Society.
Recently, Archibald Pitcairne was mentioned as the "forgotten father of mathematical medicine" and his contribution praised to creating the bases of iatromathematics .

It produces and performs 9 shows during a 9 week season each summer, including two Gilbert & Sullivan comic operas, with performances taking place in the town's the historic Highfield Theatre. 
History.
The College Light Opera Company was founded by D. Thomas Tull and Robert Haslun in 1969 immediately following the demise of the Oberlin College Gilbert & Sullivan Players who had performed in Falmouth from 1953 to 1966 Haslun had been an Oberlin College student himself and went on to become Secretary of the College, a post which he held from 1978 to 2007. Although many Oberlin students still participate in College Light Opera Company each summer, it is no longer officially associated with Oberlin College nor is it solely a Gilbert and Sullivan troupe. The company's repertoire now also includes comic operas and operettas by other composers as well as contemporary and classic Broadway musicals such as "Evita", "Jekyll & Hyde", "Brigadoon", and "Carousel".
CLOC is currently run by a Board of Trustees with Robert and Ursula Haslun as the producers. Its aim is to provide aspiring young actors and musicians with the opportunity to perform with professional directors and conductors during an 11 week resident programme while providing cultural and musical entertainment to the people of Cape Cod. It is a non profit organization, with an extensive association of donors and patrons.
The company.
The company consists of a staff between 25-30, a technical crew and costume crew of 6 members each, a 32-person vocal company and 17-20 person orchestra.
The business staff consists of the two producers - Robert A. and Ursula R. Haslun - a publicity director, an assistant business manager, and two box office treasurers. CLOC also employees a Chef de Cuisine, Director of Plant and property, and resident Costume, Set and Lighting Designer in addition to a technical director and stage manager. The creative staff consists of around 4-6 Stage Directors and Musical Directors, a choreographer, two Associate Conductors and two Accompanists. The Chef de Cuisine, Director of Plant and Property, Design Staff and Directorial staff are often professionals in the field, while the other positions are mostly filled by undergraduate/graduate students, or recent graduates.
The vocal company consists of 32 members. All members are taken on a chorus contract, with casting for principals taking place immediately prior to the start of the season. CLOC is well known for its choral training and for the high standards of its vocal performances. The 6 member stage crew includes a set designer, lighting designer, prop master and other technicians, while the 6 member costume crew is filled with stitchers and drapers.
The College Light Opera Chamber Orchestra consists of 17-20 musicians. Many are music majors, majoring in the instrument they have been contracted to play. In addition to performing in the CLOC theatre productions, the orchestra holds its own "Sunday Soiree", a chamber concert hosted by the College Light Opera Chamber Orchestra and the Cape Cod Conservatory. These concerts were started in the early 1990s by John and Avery Funkhouser and were initially held in the main hall of the West Falmouth Library until moving to the recital hall of the Cape Cod Conservatory in 2006.

Himne de l'Exposició

The "Himne de l'Exposició" (, "Anthem of the Exposition") or Himne de València ("Anthem of Valencia") is the official anthem of the Valencian Community, an autonomous community of Spain. The song was composed by Josep Serrano Simeón with lyrics written by Maximilià Thous i Orts for the 1909 Valencian Regional Exhibition. The music is based on a 16th-century anthem dedicated to Saint George, who was the patron saint of the Kingdom of Valencia. It was approved by the mayors of Alicante, Castellón and Valencia in May, 1925, and it was declared as the official anthem of the Valencian Community in 1981, with the approval of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy.
There has been some controversy over some of the words used. Some lines are considered as being too pro-Spain and some sectors of the community are pushing for an alternative tune, the Muixeranga, to be adopted instead. The Muixeranga has no lyrics, and hails from the local holidays of the town of Algemesí. However, the official anthem is widely used, especially during Falles celebrations, days celebrating Valencian patrimony, and any matches featuring the Valencian Community autonomous football team.
On 5 December 2008, a version both in Valencian and Spanish was sung and recorded by Plácido Domingo with the Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana. This updates the previous recording by Francisco.

Valerius Maximus Basilius (urban prefect 319)

(Lucius) Valerius Maximus Basilius (fl. 4th century) was a Roman senator who held high office during the reign of the Roman emperor Constantine I.
Biography.
Valerius Maximus was a member of the fourth century patrician Gens Valeria, either the son of Valerius Messalla, the Roman consul of AD 280, or (more likely) another descendant of Lucius Valerius Claudius Poplicola Balbinus Maximus, the consul of AD 253.
A pagan, Valerius Maximus’ early career is unknown. He must have had a successful political career, as he managed to be appointed Urban Prefect of Rome, serving from September 1, 319 until September 13, 323. He held this post while the emperor Constantine I was campaigning in the Balkans, and the emperor’s son, the "Caesar" Crispus was at Augusta Treverorum. The abnormally long period of time he held this post, and the extended imperial absence, indicate that he was a trusted imperial subordinate.
It is speculated that Valerius Maximus married the daughter of Septimius Bassus and had a son Valerius Maximus.

Dave Herman (fighter)

David John Herman (born October 3, 1984) is an American mixed martial artist who competed in the Heavyweight division of the UFC. Herman received a significant amount of buzz from fans and media for being undefeated in his first fifteen fights and beating his opponents impressively, having only been to a decision once in 26 professional fights. Herman has also competed in Bellator, EliteXC, World Victory Road, ShoXC, and Shark Fights.
Background.
Herman was born in Columbia City, Indiana and raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana, attending Concordia Lutheran High School. At Concordia, Herman participated in various sports including football, track and field, and cross country. He also competed in wrestling for one month in his sophomore year before being expelled from the school. After taking his GED as a junior and spending a year at IPFW, Herman transferred to Indiana University at Bloomington, which has a Division I wrestling program. Despite having basically no high school wrestling experience, Herman competed for Indiana as a walk-on and excelled, competing for three full years and part of a fourth year. He red-shirted his first season which was from 2003–04 and held an impressive 28-9 record in his second season. He then claimed the exclusive starting role in his third season, holding a 28-16 record and qualifying for the NCAA tournament, in which he went 2-2. In a 2006 pre-season ranking, Herman was placed as high as eighth in the nation. In his fourth season he started off the season flawlessly, winning a tournament in November, but left a week later with no explanation for his departure but graduated from the university with a degree in general studies. He began training in mixed martial arts after watching one of his former college teammates train in the rising sport. Herman and a third teammate joined in.
Mixed martial arts career.
Following a 2–0 amateur career, Herman made his professional mixed martial arts debut on December 31, 2006. He quickly amassed an undefeated 11–0 record, fighting 10 times throughout 2007, and went 13-0 before actually joining an MMA gym and officially begin training.
In 2008, Herman signed with the now defunct EliteXC organization. He debuted on the undercard of , defeating Mario Rinaldi via TKO. His second bout came at , where he defeated Ron Waterman via TKO. He next faced Kerry Schall in the main event of ShoXC 9, which would ultimately be the final show by the company.
Following the dissolution of EliteXC, Herman fought for a variety of promotions including Bellator Fighting Championships, Shark Fights and World Victory Road. Korean fighter Mu Bae Choi handed him his first loss in Japan on January 2009, fighting in the Sengoku promotion. In his next fight Herman defeated Jim York at Sengoku 11.
In 2010, Herman became entangled in a lawsuit with Bellator that kept him out of action in the United States for just over a year. Once the legal issues were settled, Herman was scheduled to face Ricco Rodriguez at Bellator 31 but Rodriguez pulled out of the fight due to a knee injury. Michal Kita stepped in, and served as Rodriguez's replacement. Herman defeated him via first round submission.
Herman received his second loss after being disqualified for illegal knees to Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou. Herman then faced Yoshihiro Nakao at World Victory Road Presents: Soul of Fight. He won the fight via decision, the first fight in his career to go the distance.

Ptahmose (vizier)

Ptahmose was a High Priest of Amun and Vizier of southern Egypt-(Upper Egypt), under Amenhotep III (18th Dynasty). Certain historians place him at the end of the reign in 1378 BC. Others place him in the first part of the reign.
Life.
He was succeeded as vizier in the south by Ramose, and several documents in Ptahmose's name are spread among the world's main Egyptological collections dating him at the latest to 28–30 years after Amenhotep III's reign.
A stela at the musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon allows us to better know this man who - in a rare instance - combined the offices of Vizier, Mayor of Thebes, and High Priest of Amon. The stela's provenance is not indicated by the museum's archives, though it was probably deposited by Ptahmose's family ex voto at Abydos. It dates him to Amenhotep III's reign, since that pharaoh's cartouche appears on it. Its text is effectively made up of classic laudatory formulae addressed to Osiris as well as prayers that Ptahmose may profit from the offerings made to the god in his temple, which supports the stela coming from the god's temple rather than Ptahmose's tomb. It was erected after his death, since it calls him "justified", a typical term given to the dead. He is shown in the robes of a high priest adoring Osiris and he addresses the reader in a set of classic formulae used by the dead in the form of a "negative confession" to the god. It mentions the expansion of Ptahmose's tomb at the pharaoh's expense and that it is joined to "his funerary monument in the city of eternity, his final place of residence". A long biographical text gives the precise details of his career and in the lower register are shown his 7 children before their parents, in a typical pose for scenes of funerary offerings. It gives their names as Thutmose (chief prophet of Horus), Houy (younger brother, whose titles and offices are not specified), Nefertari, Mutemwia, Hemetnetjer, Mutnofret and a second Nefertari - all five daughters are "musicians of Amon". Houy and the second Nefertari were probably still children or adolescents when the stela was put up, explaining why no offices are given for him and the representation of her as a young girl. The stela also tells us that Ptahmose's wife was called Apeny and was still alive when the stela was put up (since her name and titles are not followed by the qualifiers reserved for the dead mentioned above).
Burial.
Ptahmose was likely buried in Thebes. Funerary cones of the First Prophet of Amun Ptahmose are in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum.

Foundation for Art and Creative Technology

FACT (The Foundation for Art & Creative Technology) is a new media arts centre based on "Wood Street" in Liverpool, England.
Support for the creative industries.
It claims to be "the UK's leading organisation for the development, support and exhibition of film, video and new and emerging media".
For audiences, FACT provides a point of entry into the arts of film, video and new media. For artists, it is a support system without parallel in the UK. For Liverpool, it forms a key aspect of its cultural and economic renaissance.
FACT was a key organisation during Liverpool's European Capital of Culture year, 2008.
The Building.
Designed by architectural firm , the building is situated on "Wood Street" in the Ropewalks area of the city centre. It offers three gallery spaces, four cinema screens and a multimedia suite and also comprises a cafe, a bar and a lounge area.
2003 opening.
FACT was Liverpool’s first purpose-built arts centre for more than 60 years. It was opened in February 2003 by its founding executive director Eddie Berg, having cost £10 million to build. The building is linked to Bold Street, one of Liverpool’s main shopping areas, by a public square off Wood Street and Colquitt Street.
Building design.
The brief to the architects was to create a bold landmark building on a site previously occupied by a 1960s garage. In response Austin-Smith:Lord has created a building very different in character to the surrounding red-brick warehouses. The zinc tile-clad façade defines the building; interspersed with seven programmable LED-illuminated columns, running the building’s full six-storey height, it is a huge wide screen bent around two elevations.
Facilities.
Beyond the façade are galleries dedicated to new media artwork, space for online and streaming media broadcasts, the Medialab for the development and production of artists’ projects, and 'The Box' a 50 cinema and event space (featuring sofas rather than traditional cinema seating), a café and a bar. In addition is Picturehouse at FACT, run by leading independent operator City Screen, with three state-of-the-art cinemas showing the latest arthouse releases alongside more mainstream films.
Once inside, the foyer is a dramatic 4-storey void providing a dramatic route through the building linking the new public spaces. Exposed concrete is used on the ceilings and outer walls of the exhibition spaces, with black concrete floors in the foyer, lounge and bar areas - the natural colours providing a suitable backdrop for the artwork.
The sweep of the box office desk and the walls of the exhibition spaces are designed to draw visitors to the heart of the building and up the concrete cantilevered stairs to the upper floors, where the bar and Picturehouse cinema screens are housed. The cafe area is situated adjacent to the rear entrance, where full-height glazing opens onto Arthouse square.
The Cinemas.
Within FACT, Picturehouse Liverpool’s three high quality screens seat 264, 152 and 104 people, all screens are to THX standard. Supported by one metre deep concrete beams, the huge sculptural under-bellies of these screens are visible from both the ground and upper floors. Access to the screens is at second floor level from the lounge and bar area, accessible by another staircase and framed by the building’s large square window. A further exhibition space is also available next to the bar.
Technical details Screen 1 Picturehouse @ FACT 
FACT TV.
In 2008, during its programme for Liverpool's European Capital of Culture year, FACT launched FACT TV - an online platform for audiences to experience digital arts and culture.
Designed in-house by FACT’s Media Services team and funded by Arts Council England, FACT TV offers a chance to see the vast programme of work by the UK’s centre for film video and new media art, plus work by FACT and Arena Housing’s ground-breaking web-casting project "tenantspin" and FACT’s work with young filmmakers.
This platform is now called Artplayer.tv and features content from arts organisations around the UK.

David Hoadley (businessman)

David Hoadley (February 13, 1806 – August 20, 1873) was an American businessman, and an executive in the banking and railroad industries. He is best known for taking over the Panama Railway in November 1851 as the company faced bankruptcy while attempting to build a railroad across the Isthmus of Panama. Hoadley was able to stabilize the company as well as complete the railroad a year ahead of schedule.
Early life.
Hoadley was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1806. He was a direct descendent of William Hoadley, who had settled Branford, Connecticut, in 1666. He was the eldest son of David and Rachel (Beecher) Hoadley. His father was a carpenter and architect who built several well-known Congregational churches and many fine homes (including the Samuel Wadsworth Russell House) in the area.
Hoadley worked in his future father-in-law's pharmacy in New Haven, Connecticut. In April 1827, he founded his own wholesale drug business in New York City, an enterprise which proved extremely profitable. He married Mary Hotchkiss, daughter of his old employer, on December 23, 1829. The couple had three children: Mary (born November 17, 1830), Sarah (born August 16, 1832), and Russell (born August 19, 1834). On April 5, 1854, Sarah married the wealthy mine owner William E. Dodge, Jr. of Phelps Dodge fame. Mary Hotchkiss Hoadley died June 9, 1837, at the age of 26.
David Hoadley then married Elizabeth Crannel Tappen, daughter of a Danbury, Connecticut, doctor, on June 12, 1838. The couple had three more children: Alice (born July 4, 1839), Tappen (born February 11, 1841), Elizabeth (born June 1, 1844), Olivia (born November 17, 1848), and Adelaide (born February 4, 1855).
Illness forced Hoadley to retired from the wholesale pharmaceutical supply business in 1848. But his health improved the following year, and he was named vice president of the American Exchange Bank (now part of the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.He proved extremely adept at finance, and his leadership of the bank gained him widespread fame.
Panama Railroad presidency.
Hoadley's managerial expertise became so widely regarded that he was named President of the Panama Railway on November 1, 1851. The goal of the Panama Railway was to build a railroad across the Isthmus of Panama, linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans which would lessen the length of shipping and avoid the Cape of Good Hope for cargo. The railway was chartered on April 18, 1849, and construction began in May 1850. Construction proceeded very slowly due to the poor condition of the soil, the exceedingly hot and humid climate, and numerous tropical diseases (especially malaria). By November 1851, construction had proceeded so slowly that the Panama Railroad Company faced bankruptcy. The chief engineer John Trautwine was forced to resign. Company president C.J. Young also resigned, and David Hoadley was named his successor.
Under Hoadley, the railroad not only survived but thrived. In part, this was due to sheer luck: Three weeks after Hoadley assumed control of the railroad, two steamships with over 1,000 passengers were forced by a storm to put in at Aspinwall (the western terminus of the railroad). The railroad had only just completed construction of its docks at Aspinwall. The ships' passengers demanded to be put ashore and were granted passage aboard the railroad (at outrageously high prices). Although the rail line was only a third complete, the passengers were extremely grateful at being able to cut months from their long sea voyage. When news of the incident reached the United States, Panama Railroad Company shares soared and the company saved from bankruptcy.
Hoadley re-ordered the management of the construction teams, adding thousands of workers and additional equipment as well as the construction of the line from the east to the west (not just west to east). With Hoadley's firm managerial hand, construction of the railroad was finished a year in advance, despite its early troubles. The railway ran its first train on January 28, 1855, making it the first transcontinental railroad in North America. Hoadley chartered a steamship and traveled to Panama for the occasion, where he rode the train to the Pacific Ocean.
Retirement and death.
Hoadley retired from the Panama Railroad in 1869.He sold his home in New York City and moved to Englewood, New Jersey, taking up residence in his former summer home. He lived there until his death in 1873.

Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft

The Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft (ZATW/ZAW) is an academic German journal established in 1881. It is concerned with theological, linguistic and historical criticism of the Old Testament. Formerly, it represented a strictly Protestant point of view. At the present time, it is more ecumenical, also representing Catholic and Jewish points of view. 
Its first editor was Bernhard Stade. 
Currently, the journal is edited by Hans-Christoph Schmitt and Ernst-Joachim Waschke and published by Walter de Gruyter. It is edited two times per year in both a printed version and an internet version (). The majority of articles are written in German, but some of them are written in English and French.

Leggett–Garg inequality

The Leggett–Garg inequality, named for Anthony James Leggett and Anupam Garg, is a mathematical inequality fulfilled by all macrorealistic physical theories. Here, macrorealism (macroscopic realism) is a classical worldview defined by the conjunction of two postulates:
In quantum mechanics.
In quantum mechanics, the Leggett–Garg inequality is violated, meaning that the time evolution of a system cannot be understood classically. The situation is similar to the violation of Bell's inequalities in Bell test experiments which plays an important role in understanding the nature of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox. Here quantum entanglement plays the central role. The violation of Bell's inequalities rules out local hidden variable theories which attempt to restore the realism in the sense that definiteness of the outcome in a single measurement can be ensured by using a supplementary variable along with the wave function which can not be obtained in the standard Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics in its various formulations.
As well as Einstein's famous "God does not play dice" objection to quantum mechanics, there was Einstein's still more fundamental objection that the Moon is still there when nobody looks. If the violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality can be demonstrated on the "macroscopic scale", this would challenge even this notion of realism.
Two-state example.
The simplest form of the Leggett–Garg inequality derives from examining a system that has only two possible states. These states have corresponding measurement values formula_1. The key here is that we have measurements at two different times, and one or more times between the first and last measurement. The simplest example is where the system is measured at three successive times formula_2. Now suppose, for instance, that there is a perfect correlation formula_3 of 1 between times formula_4 and formula_5. That is to say, that for N realisations of the experiment, the temporal correlation reads
We look at this case in some detail. What can be said about what happens at time formula_7? Well, it is possible that formula_8, so that the if the value at
formula_9, then it is also formula_10 for both times 
formula_11 and formula_5. It is also quite possible that
that formula_13, so that the value at formula_14 is
flipped twice, and so has the same value at formula_15 as it did at
formula_4. So, we can have both formula_17 and 
formula_18 anti-correlated as long as we have formula_18
and formula_20 anti-correlated. Yet another possibility is 
that there is no correlation between formula_17 and 
formula_18. That is we could have formula_23.
So, although it is known that if formula_1 at formula_25
it must also be formula_10 at formula_5, the value
at formula_11 may well as be determined by the toss of a coin.
We define formula_29 as formula_30.
In these three cases, we have 
formula_31 and formula_32, respectively.
All that was for 100% correlation between times formula_33 
and formula_34. In fact, for any correlation between these
times formula_35. To see this, we note that
It is easily seen that for every realisation formula_37, the term in the
parentheses must be less than or equal to unity, so that the result for the sum is also less than (or equal to) unity. If we have four distinct times rather than three, we have formula_38 and so on. These are the Leggett–Garg inequalities. They say something definite about the relation between the temporal correlations of formula_39
and the correlations between successive times in going from the start to the end.
In the derivations above, it has been assumed that the quantity Q, representing the state of the system, always has a definite value (macrorealism per se) and that its measurement at a certain time does not change this value nor its subsequent evolution (noninvasive measurability). A violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality implies that at least one of these two assumptions fails.
Experimental violations.
The Leggett–Garg inequality is always violated on the microscopic scale. 
An example is given by Brukner and Kofler in. However, they have also demonstrated that quantum violations can be found for arbitrarily large "macroscopic" systems. As an alternative to quantum decoherence, Brukner and Kofler are proposing a solution of the quantum-to-classical transition in terms of "coarse-grained" quantum measurements under which usually no violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality can be seen anymore.
One of the most promising proposed experiments for demonstrating a violation of macroscopic realism employs superconducting quantum interference devices. There, using Josephson junctions, one should be able to prepare macroscopic superpositions of left and right rotating macroscopically large electronic currents in a superconducting ring. Under sufficient suppression of decoherence one should be able to demonstrate a violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality.
A criticism of some other proposed experiments on the Leggett–Garg inequality is that they do not really show a violation of macrorealism because they are essentially about measuring spins of individual particles. However, this book cites later work by Mermin and Braunstein and Mann which would be better tests of macroscopic realism, but warns that the experiments may be complex enough to admit unforeseen loopholes in the analysis.
Related inequalities.
The four-term Leggett–Garg inequality can be seen to be similar to the CHSH inequality. Moreover, "equalities" were proposed by Jaeger "et al."

Battle of Kosovo (Serbo-Croatian: Бој на Косову, Boj na Kosovu) is a 1989 Yugoslav historical drama/war film filmed in Serbia. The film was based on the drama written by poet Ljubomir Simović. It depicts the historical Battle of Kosovo between Medieval Serbia and the Ottoman Empire which took place on 15 June 1389 (according to the Julian calendar, 28 June 1389 by the Gregorian calendar) in a field about 5 kilometers northwest of Pristina.
Serbian Duke Lazar in 1389 refuses to obey the Turk Sultan Murat who intends on invading Serbia with an army in order to conquer Europe. Although aware that he is weaker, without enough men, Duke Lazar decides to fight him anyway. The Serbian Lords are not united. Most of them want to fight, even at the cost of defeat, but some of them do not. Everyone fit for battle is sent to Kosovo. The battle of Kosovo in 1389 ended with no winners - with both armies defeated and both Lazar and Murat dead. The Turks would proceed to invade Serbia but were hindered from taking over the rest of Europe. 
The film was released in 1989, which marked the 600th anniversary of the Battle.

Kirk Smeaton railway station

Kirk Smeaton railway station opened on 22 July 1885. It is located on the east side of Willowbridge Road in Little Smeaton, North Yorkshire, England. The Company that ran the station on opening was the Hull Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company. The station closed to passengers on 1 January 1932 and closed completely on 6 April 1959. The operating company on closing was British Railways (North Eastern Region).
Notes: After closure some excursions ran from the station to Hull Fair and Leeds football ground. These included 14 October 1933 during Hull Civic Week and 28 February 1953 to Leeds.
A brief history of The Hull and Barnsley Railway.
The Hull Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company was formed with the backing of Hull Corporation to break the monopoly on dock and rail traffic from Hull; it included a deep water dock (Alexandra Dock) to the east of Hull. The railway never reached Barnsley itself, terminating at Cudworth (junction with the Midland Railway) some four miles short having been vigorously opposed by the NER.
It was one of the last new main lines to be built, construction cost double the estimates, due in part to difficulties in cutting and tunnelling through unexpectedly hard chalk in the Yorkshire Wolds near Little Weighton.
Although it was constructed primarily for goods traffic to and from the new dock and the South Yorkshire coalfields, fine villa-style passenger stations were provided but though passenger traffic was sparse.
In 1905 the company name was shortened to the Hull and Barnsley Railway which was absorbed into the NER on 1 January 1923.
The line was gradually run down from the early 1930s with all passenger services ceasing in 1955. Today only the high level goods line around Hull and a short section serving Drax power station remain in use.

Yasuhiko Fukuda

History and career.
Born in Tokyo's Itabashi prefecture, Fukuda began playing piano at the age of 4, and while at school became interested in anime ("We were the first anime generation"). He graduated from Takeheya Senior High School in 1976 and began attending the department of literature at Waseda University in 1978. Around this time, he won a prize for excellence in the Yamaha-sponsored band tournament EAST WEST 78.
Graduating from Waseda in 1980, Fukuda went on to make his professional debut, playing keyboards in the band QUYS. The band was formed alongside bassist Yoshihiro Naruse (currently of Casiopea) and drummer Okai Daiji (ex-member of Yonin Bayashi). The following year marked his recording debut as a session musician on June Yamagishi's 1981 solo album All The Same, along with his major debut with Hideo Saito in the band YOU. In 1982 he was a participating member of Bakufu Slump prior to their debut, and in 1983 played with Minami Kousetsu as a live tour musician.
Following these early exposures to the industry, Fukuda became a frequently employed studio musician - he went from playing for artists such as Kodomo Band, Shogo Hamada, Kozo Murashita, Yoshiyuki Ohzawa to then-contemporary pop figures such as Shibugakitai, Seiko Matsuda and Ryoko Sano. As a studio player, he has participated in the recording of over a thousand songs. Also during this period, he collaborated with fellow synthesist Noritaka Ubukata in the development of a sound patch for the Yamaha DX7 digital synthesizer called "Shofuku", which was released in 1984. Shofuku later became the name of a recording unit featuring the two musicians in 1988. Fukuda also penned books documenting the DX7's programmable synthesis, one of which, "Yamaha DX7 Digital Synthesizer", was translated and sold in the West.
He is perhaps most well known for his video game and anime soundtracks. He has worked for Hudson Soft, and is perhaps best known for his soundtracks to various games from the "Bomberman" franchise. He is currently the keyboardist in the Japanese jazz-funk and fusion band BeatNuts, and has played in numerous other bands, such as YOU, QUYZ, and Kodomo Band. He is often credited as "Hirohiko Fukuda".

The Delta and Providence Cooperative Farms were started in Bolivar County, Mississippi, in 1936; and Holmes County, Mississippi, in 1939, respectively. The farms were founded and run by missionary evangelist and author Sherwood Eddy, and Reverend Sam H. Franklin, with the goal of helping southern sharecroppers out of their economic plight (caused in part by side effects of the New Deal's Agricultural Adjustment Administration). Eddy drew considerable support from his friend, the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, who once called the farms "the most significant experiment in social Christianity now being conducted in America." 
The cooperatives were organized around four principles: efficiency in production and economy in finance through the cooperative principle, participation in building a socialized economy of abundance, inter-racial justice, and realistic religion as a social dynamic. In the early stages, many of the first cooperative members at the Delta Cooperative Farm were sharecroppers from eastern Arkansas who had been evicted following a strike.
Because the farms were committed to economic equality among races, all cooperative members were to receive equal pay for equal work. Agricultural operations included growing cotton, dairy and beef farms, a pasteurizing plant, and a saw mill. The cooperatives also provided a number of social and other services to members and the surrounding communities, including a cooperative store, a credit union, a medical clinic, educational programs, a library, religious services, and summer work camps for students.
Due to several factors, including the tense political climate of the 1950s and poor cotton sales at Providence, cooperative efforts were abandoned around 1956, and pieces of the land were sold off to members.

Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!

Smile, Darn Ya, Smile! is a Merrie Melodies cartoon short (September 5, 1931), and also the title of the song performed in the cartoon. This is one of the only three Merrie Melodies cartoons to star Foxy; the other two are "Lady, Play Your Mandolin!" (August, 1931) and "One More Time" (October 3, 1931). This short is a remake of "Trolley Troubles", a Disney short featuring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in whose creation Hugh Harman had once been involved. 
Synopsis.
Foxy is a trolley engineer whose problems include an obese lady hippo who can't fit into the trolley and a set of wheels that detach from the trolley car while it's moving. Foxy picks up his vixen girlfriend and gives her a ride, but along the way, the car is blocked by a cow who won't get off the track. A group of nearby hobos sing the title song while Foxy tries to move the cow; he finally runs the car underneath the cow and goes on his way.
The trolley then goes down a hill and runs out of control; Foxy tries to stop it, but the brakes don't work. Finally, the trolley runs off of a cliff, throwing Foxy right into the camera... and then he falls from bed, waking up from what has turned out to be just a nightmare. The radio by his bed is playing the title song, and the annoyed Foxy smashes the radio with a bedpost upon hearing it.

National Dance Awards

The National Dance Awards are presented annually in the United Kingdom by The Critics' Circle, and are awarded to recognise excellence in professional dance. They are widely regarded as the most prestigious award presented for dance in the UK, and are considered to be the equivalent of the Laurence Olivier Awards, which are presented for general theatre. 
Overview.
The National Dance Awards (NDAs), were first presented by The Critics' Circle at the Coliseum Theatre, London, in 2001. The key sponsor of the event was the late Richard Sherrington and an award is now presented in his name every year. Since the first ceremony, the awards have also been hosted by the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells Theatre, with both organisations providing sponsorship for the event. Since the 2011 awards, the ceremony has been held at The Place. Artwork for the awards was created by Deborah MacMillan, widow of the late Sir Kenneth Macmillan.
Categories.
The awards are judged by the critics and journalists who see and review dance companies in performance on a daily basis. There are 11 awards for performances over the preceding year. For most of the awards there are four nominations made in each category.
There are two additional awards for which nominations are not announced in advance: the Ninette De Valois Award for Outstanding Achievement and the Jane Attenborough Industry Award.

Biography.
Nohara (born c. 1967) worked in Tokyo cleaning office buildings prior to his arrival in Mexico. During his stay at the airport, he lived off food given to him by airport fast food establishments, and blankets, clothing and other miscellaneous items brought to him by curious people who visited him. Later, owing to Nohara's acquired celebrity status, the fast food chains also started to give him branded shirts, caps, and mugs, with the expectation that the items would appear on the frequent nation-wide television interviews. Nohara learned some Spanish and apparently knew some English as well.
The local media did conduct an interview with him with an interpreter, yet he refused to explain his long stay at the airport, even though he did not have any documentation problems. An airport waitress suggested this was due to some relationship matter.

Shelbourne, Bohemians and Derry City are the only clubs to win both the (Northern) Irish Cup and the FAI Cup, although Shelbourne and Bohemians only won it before partition, whilst Derry City remained in the Northern Irish league system until 1973, entering the League of Ireland in 1985.
From 1990 until 2006 the FAI Cup Final was held at the old Lansdowne Road. For 2007 and 2008 the RDS was used as an alternative venue during the redevelopment of the Road. The 2006 final was the last ever soccer game to be played at the old Lansdowne Road. It was contested between St Patrick's Athletic and Derry City, who ran out eventual 4-3 winners after extra-time.

Atomic Power is an American short documentary film produced by "The March of Time" and released to theaters August 9, 1946, one year after the end of World War II.
Raymond Fielding, chronicler of "The March of Time", cites "Atomic Power" as the only one of the series' postwar films to emerge as a classic. "It tells of the making of the atomic bomb, and is a quite remarkable example of film making in the "March of Time" tradition," Fielding wrote.
Nearly every person involved in the invention of the atomic bomb performs as an actor in the film, recreating the events and conversations that led up to the Trinity test, which is also reenacted and intercut with government footage of the blast. Jack Glenn directed.
"Atomic Power" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.

<doc id="20376632" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20376632" title="Independent Regulatory Review Commission">
Independent Regulatory Review Commission

The Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC) is an independent agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is responsible for the review of regulations from nearly all state agencies, boards and commissions before they go into effect. These regulations span the broadest possible array of topics, such as bank lending practices, food safety, educational standards, dog breeding, nursing facilities, gaming facilities, and more.
The Regulatory Review Act (RRA), which created IRRC, provides for a forum to examine and resolve differences between the promulgating agency, the legislature and the members of the public that will be directly impacted by these regulations. To accomplish this, IRRC interacts with all parties, frequently advocating changes, where necessary, to accomplish the best regulatory balance. IRRC is statutorily required to ensure proposed regulatory provisions are in the public interest.
Regulations, as well as outside input from the regulated public and the legislature, are reviewed by the professionals at IRRC and made available to all parties on IRRC’s website http://www.irrc.state.pa.us . The website not only details information about a specific regulation, but catalogs comments from the public, legislators and IRRC in a fully searchable database. Ultimately, the agency’s regulations are considered and voted on by IRRC’s commissioners in a public meeting where all parties can express their support for, or opposition to the regulations. Through IRRC’s efforts, the entire process of a regulation’s evolution is made transparent and accessible to all parties. [http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
Mission and Purpose.
Prior to the enactment of the Regulatory Review Act (RRA) in the early 1980s, there were few controls on the promulgation of regulations by state government agencies. According to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, insufficient consideration was given to the economic and social impact the agency regulations would have on those subject to compliance and the public at large. The creation of IRRC established a channel for legislative oversight, a mechanism for detailed and comprehensive impact analysis, and a forum for public input.
IRRC's mission is to foster executive branch accountability. IRRC commissioners and staff exercise their expertise, authority, and independence to engage in ongoing and effective review and oversight of regulations. IRRC increases communication with promulgating agencies and the regulated public to achieve a streamlined and effective review process. Ultimately, IRRC assists the Governor and the General Assembly by encouraging the resolution of objections to regulation. [http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
Regulatory Review Process in PA.
While many states engage some level of regulatory review, Pennsylvania is the only state that maintains an independent regulatory agency. The Regulatory Review Act, initially enacted in 1982, established the regulatory review process and created IRRC. The reenactment of the Act in 1989 established the current two-step oversight process. IRRC and the designated standing committees of the General Assembly now review regulations first as proposed and then again in final form.[http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
Proposed Regulations.
Many pieces of legislation include a subsection devoted to rules and regulations. A specific board or agency is identified to promulgate regulations in order to implement any given Act. For instance, the Department of Public Welfare drafted a regulation intended to implement Act 56. This initiative has been submitted to IRRC and subject to review.[http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
IRRC's Review Criteria.
A proposed regulation must be accompanied by a Regulatory Analysis Form. This form provides a concise and nontechnical explanation of the proposed regulation, a statement of the need for the regulation, and estimates of direct or indirect costs to the Commonwealth. The Regulatory Analysis Form also provides a specific citation to the federal or state statutory or regulatory authority which the regulation is designed to implement.[http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
Public Comments.
At this point in the review process, the general public, IRRC, and the appropriate standing committees are given the opportunity to comment on the proposed regulation. The promulgating agency must allow for a comment period of at least 30 days in which the public may comment. The agency must submit each comment on the regulation to the standing committees and IRRC within five business days of receipt. IRRC includes comments received in its public regulatory files and retains them for four years following promulgation of the regulation.[http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
IRRC's Formal Comments.
At the close of the public comment period, IRRC has 30 days to file comments with the agency. Regulatory analysts explore legal and policy issues a proposed regulation may present. Review involves independent research, an analysis of public comments, and discussions with standing committees, the agency, and affected or interested parties. [http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
Committee's Formal Comments.
The committees may, at any time prior to the submittal in final form, file comments, recommendations, or objections to proposed regulations. The extended time frame for committee comment is an important element of the regulatory review process. It ensures that committees have the benefit of IRRC’s comments when deciding whether to file their own comments and what issues will have the greatest impact on the Commonwealth.[http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
Final Regulations.
When submitting the regulation in its final form, the promulgating agency must consider and respond to all comments presented by the public, committees, and IRRC. The agency must submit the final-form regulation and its response to comments to IRRC and the committees within two years of the close of the public comment period. If the agency fails to meet this deadline, but still wants to promulgate the regulation, it must propose a new regulation.
When IRRC receives a final-form regulation, it is placed on the public meeting agenda within thirty days and is voted on at IRRC’s public meeting.[http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
Organization of IRRC.
The Commissioners.
The Commission has five members. One member is appointed by the Governor, one by the President pro tempore of the Senate, one by the Speaker of the House, one by the Minority Leader of the Senate, and one by the Minority Leader of the House.
The legislative appointees serve for three-year terms and may be reappointed. Commissioners may only be removed for misfeasance or malfeasance in office. The Governor's appointee serves at the Governor's pleasure and is not subject to term allotments.
The Commission generally meets twice per month. Official action of the Commission requires a quorum.[http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
In July, 2010, the following five men are members of the commission:
Arthur Coccodrilli, George D. Bedwick, Silvan B. Lutkewitte, III, John Mizner, and S. David Fineman.
Regulatory Review Section.
The IRRC's regulatory review analysts are charged with the task of researching and analyzing proposed and final regulations by applying a specific set of criteria. Their primary objective is to assist the Commissioners with the development of formal comments. Those comments are ultimately delivered to the promulgating agency, presented to the standing committees in the House and the Senate, and published in the "Pennsylvania Bulletin".
Regulatory analysts carry out their duties through extensive independent research. The original statute a promulgating agency is using as justification for a regulation is an invaluable research tool. The concerns of the regulated community are assessed through both public comments and on-site visits. Analysts meet with those parties and individuals that will be affected by the regulation in order to gauge the impact that the regulation will have. Analysts also meet with agencies, public organizations, legislators, and legislative staff to discuss issues, questions, and suggestions regarding an individual regulation.[http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]
Outreach and Regulatory Services.
The Outreach and Regulatory Services Division (ORS) was created in October 2005 to strengthen IRRC’s communication with state agencies, legislators and staff, the press, and the general public. IRRC recognized a greater need for customer-based philosophy and activity.
The Outreach Division fulfills their responsibilities through a number of services. The Outreach Division serves as the press contact for the Commission, conducts courtesy reviews of forthcoming proposed regulations, and conducts seminars and workshops that are tailored to meet the specific needs of the audience. ORS attends meetings and engages in correspondence with individual legislators and agencies. This interaction is intended to keep both legislators and agencies abreast of general activities and issues that may be important to them. ORS also performs continuing management and development with regard to the IRRC official webpage.[http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/]

then the resulting system has an equilibrium at the origin (i.e., where formula_58, formula_59, formula_60, ... , formula_61, and formula_62) that is globally asymptotically stable.

List of Drake &amp; Josh characters

This is a complete list of characters from the Nickelodeon television series Drake & Josh.
Main characters.
Drake Parker.
Drake (Drake Bell) is depicted as a cool, easygoing, popular, irresponsible, and self-absorbed teenager. Although he often appears unintelligent, his under-achievement seems to be caused by laziness and he has been known not to act before he thinks. Drake has great interest in music, playing the electric guitar in a band throughout the series and liking all forms, his favorite being rock. He can also play drums and percussion shown in one episode when he tried to play drums and guitar at the same time and in another episode where he played the bongos. He usually takes advantage of Josh to get what he wants. He has a lot of success with girls and much of the comedy is his effortless ability to get dates. Drake is also very unhygienic (not washing hands, eating food off the floor). Drake felt embarrassed about his new stepbrother at first, but he has grown to accept Josh more. Despite his selfishness and laziness, Drake still remains a likable character and redeems himself by doing the right thing. In 2010, Drake Bell made an appearance in the "iCarly" Season 3 episode "iBloop" which stars his "Drake & Josh" co-star Miranda Cosgrove. He reprised his role as Drake Parker to make an appearance in the episode, during which he seems to have stepped into the alternate fictional universe of "iCarly" where he recognizes Cosgrove's character as Megan Parker and follows by asking the whereabouts of Josh and the rest of his family. In the first season, Drake's hair was spiky, before becoming flat for the rest of the series.
Age: 15-16 (Season 1), 16 (season 2),16-17 (Season 3), 17-18 (Season 4)
Josh Nichols.
Josh (Josh Peck) is usually the most educationally successful and responsible one, although he is not even close to being the socially successful one. He had a job for the school newspaper as Miss Nancy in Pilot. Unlike Drake, he usually stresses over school a lot and uses his common sense, and sometimes repeats things for "...emphasis...EMPHASIS!" Despite his good character and good grades, Josh is prone to bad luck, especially with girls. He often has a bad habit when a person tells him to take care of something, when Josh questionably objects, the person tells him more firmly. Later, he begins to date Mindy Crenshaw, who is his academic rival. Josh has a job at The Premiere movie theater, where he gets an average number of customers. He loves his job and has had hopes of becoming assistant manager. His hobbies are playing video games, cooking, and performing magic tricks. He usually suffers expense from Drake's carefree behavior, but the boys somehow complete each other. Later in the series, Josh becomes more popular and gains better luck. He was always considered obese, but suggestively lost a large amount of weight throughout the series. He is obsessed with Oprah Winfrey and ran her over with his car by accident. Even though Drake is usually more successful with girls, Josh gets 22 dates in a week to win a bet from Drake in "Who's Got Game". Josh is known to have a perfect attendance, but that came to an end in "The Affair" when he and Drake skip school to see if Walter is cheating on Audrey. Mindy is his girlfriend at the end of the series. Josh has appeared in every single episode. Josh appears in "Victorious" in the Season 1 episode "Wok Star", where he attends Jade's play and after the commencement he greets her to tell her "Great Work" and attempts to shake her hand, and she shrugs him off by saying "whatever." His catchphrase is "oh geez" when something goes wrong for him.
Megan Parker.
Megan (Miranda Cosgrove) is Drake's antagonistic conceited and evil younger sister whose most notable character hallmark is her severe mistreatment of her brothers and the extreme, complex practical jokes she often manages to pull on them with limited reasons for doing so other than for the pleasure of watching them suffer. Various implications have hinted that her hostile behavior may actually be far more intense than common sibling rivalry and have even pointed at heartlessness in her character, in spite of the fact that she masks her awful pranks with a sweet, innocent nature in the presence of her parents. A number of her pranks have been proven potentially deadly or dangerous for her victimized brothers, and Megan is also shown to be quite quick-witted; she is able to stage plots of vengeance against her brothers for pranks that have not been pulled yet in revenge against her, and able to feign belief in their practical jokes, leaving Drake and Josh virtually defenseless against their sister's pranks. For the most part she is depicted as being wicked, sassy, and cruel, but Megan loves Drake and Josh deep down, and on rare occasions, Megan shows genuine love and gratitude towards her brothers, such as when they uncovered the true personality of her new boyfriend. Usually, she is rude and disrespectful with her brothers. It has sometimes been implied that Megan may possess the qualities of a genius, establishing a concealed computerized monitor in her bedroom so that she may keep her brothers under perpetual surveillance, and her powers of persuasion have earned herself her way before in the past, even against those of higher authority than her (who she is capable of outsmarting with ease) and she's able to contact people who may be of use to her in a certain situation in events that usually would be far beyond the control of a girl her age.
She also usually mentions her best friend Janie.
Age: 9-10 (Season 1), 10(Season 2), 11-12 (Season 3) and 12-13 (Season 4)
Audrey Parker-Nichols.
Audrey (Nancy Sullivan) is Drake and Megan's mother and Josh's stepmother. Her real name is never mentioned in the series, but is revealed in most scripts as "Audrey". She is usually telling the boys to try not to be so immature. She upsets her husband Walter because of her preference to Bruce Winchill, his rival weatherman. Because Walter is unable to discipline the boys, she usually has to punish the boys although these punishments are usually unfair because most are Megan's fault. Her profession was never specified in the series, but it is generally assumed that she is a stay-at-home mom.
Walter Nichols.
Walter (Jonathan Goldstein) is Josh's father and Drake and Megan's stepfather. He is a meteorologist for a local TV news program in San Diego, but he is often wrong about the weather. Walter is often clumsy, out of date, and seemingly empty-headed. As a result, he lacks the respect of his stepchildren as Drake and Megan (they refuse to call him "Dad" in most episodes and instead they call him by his first name, which stepchildren commonly do). When Megan calls him by his first name, he always asks "When did she start calling me Walter?" and Audrey just says "I don't know." He is also clueless and skeptical in regards to Megan's pranks which have caused the boys a lot of punishments, although in Seasons 3 and 4, Walter slowly begins to notice Megan's evil ways. A running gag involves a rivalry between him and Bruce Winchill, an unseen weatherman from another station. He hates that Winchill is so popular, as he is always right with his predictions, and forbids use of Winchill's name in the house.
Recurring characters.
Craig Ramirez and Eric Blonowitz.
Craig (Alec Medlock) and Eric (Scott Halberstadt) are two stereotypical "nerdy" honor students that are always being exploited by Drake, mostly due to his hare-brained schemes. Drake often mistakes Eric for Craig. Craig corrected him one time, and Drake sarcastically said "It matters". Eric first appeared in the pilot episode as an extra and along with his best friend, Craig, a few times in Season 2, but they appear more frequently in Seasons 3 and 4. They usually are good friends and good in nature, but not free of a selfish side. Eric left for Puerto Rico in "Dance Contest," even though it was set before "" which included both Craig and Eric (possibly due to the fact the movie premiered before the episode). They are similar to and loosely based on Cecily and Gwendolyn Pigeon from "The Odd Couple", such as the characters' names always get mixed up by the sloppiest protagonist Drake/Oscar. Craig and Eric appear on "iCarly" in with Gavin, implying that "Drake & Josh" and "iCarly" take place within the same universe.
Mindy Crenshaw.
Mindy (Allison Scagliotti) is an intelligent but boastful girl in the boys' class at school who is always trying to top the two of them, especially Josh, who is her rival. She also shows an extreme hatred for Drake, too (for an example, in one episode she parked the teacher's car in the middle of her classroom to frame Drake for the prank and have him suspended). For this misdeed, Mindy was sent to a mental hospital, causing a temporary departure from the series, but she reappeared in another episode to compete in the school science fair. Later on, she became Josh's on-again off-again girlfriend, and the two enjoy studying together. One of Mindy's well-known character traits is her extraordinary intelligence and scientific talents (she defeats Josh yearly in the science fair with the exception of one year after they started to date and she let him win, which she enjoys rubbing in his face at times and cloned her pet cockapoo), and has been shown to possess a love of sharks.
Helen Dubois (Previously Baxter).
Helen (Yvette Nicole Brown) is the manager of the Premiere theater (the movie theater where Josh formerly Drake has a job), connected to the "Premiere Galleria", a mall. She is known for her intimidation factor due to her loud voice and orders for her employees. She adores Drake, but is annoyed by Josh despite the hard work he puts in at the theater. She also starred in a hit television sitcom as a child, called "Happy Times" (a parody of the classic 1970's TV sitcoms "Happy Days" and "Good Times"). Though Yvette Nicole Brown plays Helen Dubois normally, Frances Callier filled in for her and portrayed her in "Little Diva". She became married to Buzz Baxter in "Drake & Josh: Really Big Shrimp", but divorced him some time before "Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh" after five weeks. Helen left the Premiere theater to take a job as principal of Hollywood Arts High School on another Dan Schneider series, "Victorious".
"Crazy" Steve.
Steve (Jerry Trainor) is an employee at the movie theater at which Josh works and, as his nickname suggests, is noted for his emotional and mental instability, lashing out at co-workers, strangers, and passersby over little things. Incredibly sensitive, Steve takes offense at the slightest of subjects or even the most thoroughly minor hints at insults, hollering at others for interrupting him or denying his questions, desires, or offers. Steve's utter lack of sanity has earned him a dangerously unpredictable reputation amongst colleagues, to the extent where he finds immense frustration in following along with episodes of "Dora the Explorer," screaming at the animated characters on the screen. He appears in the program's Christmas special, most notably towards its conclusion, where he shreds hunks of cheese in a wood chipper in order to grant his friends' wish for a white Christmas.
Gavin Mitchell.
Gavin (Jake Farrow) works with Josh at the Premiere and he has a mullet-like haircut (in "Who's Got Game" he got a perm). A running gag throughout the series involved Helen asking him to tell Josh to clean something unusual in the theater. He then cleans up the mess himself - telling Josh "I got it". He also has a crush on Audrey. He can apparently get away with anything at work, like taking a nap on the roof. He first appeared in "Driver's License" and made a final appearance in "Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh". Gavin appears in "iCarly" in Season 4 episode "iStart a Fan War" with Craig and Eric.
Linda Hayfer.
Mrs. Hayfer (Julia Duffy) is the boys' English teacher who adores Josh (due to his hard-working personality), but hates Drake because of his consistently poor performance in school (and judging by the doodles Drake made of Mrs. Hayfer in his English notebook in "Honor Council", Drake hates her in return). Oddly though, in the episode "Mean Teacher", Mrs. Hayfer is shown to hate Drake for no apparent reason as it is shown that when he answered a question correctly, she dubbed it incorrect and appointed the same question correct to another student right next to him as well as grading a flawless report he did with a "C" again for no logical reason. In fact, her catchphrase is "I hate you, Drake", with Drake responding, "I know". She also always says "To the nurse!", which is her own bizarre way by telling people to leave her classroom. In "Little Sibling", Mrs. Hayfer says it to Josh when she wanted to have a private talk with Drake. Mrs. Hayfer has a daughter named Kelly, who Drake briefly dates, much to her discontent. In "Honor Council", she comes into the classroom to find her car parked where the boys' seats are originally and accuses Drake of putting the car there, but her star student, Mindy, is the real culprit. In this episode, it is said that her first name is Alice. However, in "Vicious Tiberious", her name is shown in a video as Linda Hayfer. She also appears in the TV film, "Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh" while Drake is driving his car and crashes into a fire hydrant spraying her. Drake apparently hates Mrs. Hafer so much that he wishes she would die, because in the episode, "Megan's First Kiss", when Josh enters with important news, Drake's first statement is an excited, "Mrs. Hayfer died?!"
She has a brief appearance in Merry Christmas Drake and Josh, where Drake accidentally hits a fire hydrant while driving, resulting in water getting sprayed all over her. She then points out and yells here famous line: "I Hate You Drake Parker!" showing that even though they graduated, she still hates him.
Dr. Jeff Glazer.
Dr. Glazer (Roark Critchlow) is a doctor who lives across the street from the boys. He is always called on whenever a serious emergency happens at their house. Although he always seems kind while performing medical procedures for the boys, he always leaves them with a ridiculously high bill for his services (he once charged $100 for diagnosing a sheep as pregnant after she had her baby and an extra $50 not to tell Audrey and Walter and charged $300 for diagnosing Drake's facial rash). He first appeared in "The Bet" and he last appeared in "Sheep Thrills".
Bruce Winchill.
Bruce is a weatherman who works for Walter's competition news station. He is never seen on the series, but mentioned from time to time. He is described by Megan and Audrey as having good-looking hair and hated by Walter so much that at times he orders his family never to mention his name in the house.
Leah.
Leah (Cathy Shim) is a Premiere employee who is good friends with Josh. She is only seen on occasion when Josh's in the Premiere and she is afraid of Crazy Steve.
Minor characters.
Grammy Nichols.
Grammy (Randee Heller) is Josh's grandmother and Walter's mother. She loves Josh and Megan, but she hates Drake. In her only appearance in "Grammy", she expresses anger towards Drake when he decides to go to a concert even though Audrey and Walter said that he couldn't. At the end of the episode, Grammy shows affection toward Drake when he attempts to tell his parents the truth. Even though she never made an appearance in the series after "Grammy", she is later mentioned frequently. She sent gifts to Josh many times. She is last mentioned in "Merry Christmas, Drake and Josh".
Papa Nichols.
Papa Nichols (Vernon Roberts) is Josh's great-grandfather and Walter's grandfather. In his only appearance in "The Demonator", he had surgery and said he fought in World War II. Craig and Eric come over and watch him while the boys and Megan go to Mystic Mountain to ride the Demonator, but when he wakes up disorientedly, he thinks he is back in the war and attacks them, thinking they are Germans (whom he called "German Nerds"). When Eric's cell phone rings, Papa Nichols, thinking it is a weapon, throws it against the wall and breaks it. At the end of "The Demonator", he accidentally punches Walter and calls him a "German." He is later mentioned once by Josh in "The Wedding".
Aunt Catherine.
Great-Aunt Catherine is Drake and Josh's great-aunt. According to them, she is 89 years old.
Jackie.
Jackie (Robin Sydney) is obsessed with Drake and appeared in a total of four episodes. She would come into the scene randomly (usually at the end, specifically when something positive happens to Drake), and shout hysterically, "I love you! Bye!" This is considered to be one of the several running gags of the series. Whenever she would appear randomly and run off, Drake would say, "Who is she?"
Susan.
Susan (Ashley Drane) was Drake's girlfriend in the episode "Believe Me, Brother". She loved Drake but started to love Josh more than him. Whenever Drake would come near Susan with Josh, Susan would pretend to not love Josh.
Wendy.
Wendy (Alyson Stoner) has a huge crush on Drake. She was his biggest fan then she eventually became obsessed with him and wouldn't leave him alone for days. Wendy claimed that Drake was her boyfriend because she was deep in love with him and wanted to marry him someday. Moments later, she was confronted by Drake before the camp out started and he hurt her feelings which caused her heart to break. She then writes him a card of apology which he reads in "Star 99 Songwriter's Spotlight" and then he goes back home to fix it. In the end Drake played to her his romantic song, Down We Fall which he sang to her, and she was very happy to hear it. She then gave him a hug and was rewarded by getting Drake's guitar pick which he offered to her when they first met. Her only appearance was in the episode "Number 1 Fan".
Sammy.
Sammy (Jordan Wright) was a little kid that Drake needed to take care of because he got in trouble for lying to Mrs. Hayfer (Julia Duffy) about being in class on time when she left to check if the lunch ladies were fighting again, but they weren't. While Drake proceeds to take care of Sammy, he (Sammy) wanted Josh to be his big sibling. While they were doing their cooking show, Sammy complimented Josh by saying that he was the coolest guy ever. While others think that Drake is the cool guy, Sammy thought it about Josh.
Trevor.
Trevor (Taran Killam) is Drake's absent-minded friend and Scottie's older brother. Even though he only appeared in "Dune Buggy", he is mentioned several times in the series, and his voice is heard over the phone in "Josh Runs into Oprah". Trevor also gets a brain scan every month, due to his unintelligence as found out in "Dune Buggy". In "The Wedding", the boys use his car to get to Josh's Aunt Catherine's wedding, but it breaks down.
Christine.
Christine (Sarah Christine Smith) is one of Drake's ex-girlfriends. She only appeared in "The Storm".
Carly.
Carly (Brittany Curran) is Drake's girlfriend. She first appears in "Who's Got Game" where Josh challenges Drake on who can get the most dates. Drake meets her at the CD shop where she works and he falls in love with her at first sight. Carly grew fond of him too after meeting him. She dumps Drake when she finding out about the bet, thinking Drake is just using her. He then proves to her that he can be honest and they continue dating. She makes her final appearance in "The Storm" where she befriends Lucy and Christine (Drake's ex-girlfriends). Afterwards, it is not mentioned if Carly is still Drake's girlfriend. As Drake is seen flirting with other girls like in "Tree House" where he attempted to go on a double date with Josh and twins, it is possible that Drake and Carly broke up though this is debatable.
Lucy.
Lucy (Gabrielle Christian) is another one of Drake's ex-girlfriends. She is introduced in "Girl Power," where she admitted to be tougher than Drake. Although Drake disagreed, Lucy decided that the two of them should wrestle each other. Drake is hesitant about wrestling her. Lucy is considered to be a tomboy. She returned in "The Storm", where she is friends with Carly and Christine (Drake's girlfriend and ex-girlfriend, respectively).
Clayton.
Clayton (Josh Sussman) is one of the nerdy kids at school. He has talking problems since he mumbles and no one can understand what he is saying (even though closed captions reveal his incoherent mumbling). Even Craig and Eric call him a "nerd," considering that they are nerds themselves. He appears only in "Josh is Done" and "Eric Punches Drake". In "Eric Punches Drake," he begins to dislike Drake when Drake spits blue mouthwash into his bottled water, and he even goes as far as to find out where Drake and Josh live just so he could repeat ""Why"?"
Denise Woods.
Denise (Torrey DeVitto) is the girl who Drake tried to impress in "Driver's License". Torrey DeVitto appeared again as Tori in Playing the Field as Denise is a college student.
Emily Henderson.
Emily (Johanna Braddy) appeared in "Dance Contest" originally as Josh's dance partner, until Drake stole her, thinking that with her, he'd have a better shot at winning the dance contest.
Tori.
Tori (Torrey DeVitto) appeared in "Playing The Field." She and Drake were dating at the beginning of the episode, but Drake then proceeds to break up with her after an incident at the Premiere of her calling him "Boyfriend". However, when they break up, Drake sees her kissing other guys, and that makes him mad. So, he tries to win her back by kissing a hot girl named Liza Tupper and succeeds. The incident with Drake trying to make Tori jealous by dating Liza was later mentioned on the "Dr. Phyllis Show" (a parody of the Dr. Phil Show).

Drake's band is the band which Drake is the frontman.
Band members.
Scottie.
Scottie (Johnny Lewis) is the former drummer of Drake's band. He is considered to be unintelligent, according to Drake and the other band members. He appeared in four episodes in Season 1. He got himself and his band members detained at a Rock Shock concert because he photocopied their tickets in "Grammy". He, Rina, and Paul were never seen again after that. Scottie is Trevor's younger brother.
Rina.
Rina (Molly Orr) is the former bassist of Drake's band, appearing in four episodes in Season 1. She and Paul caused Drake peer pressure in "Grammy", when they had concert tickets to Rock Shock, the concert that Drake is not allowed to attend. Scottie got them detained because he photocopied their tickets. Scottie, Rina, and Paul were never seen again after that.
Paul.
Paul (Jeremy Ray Valdez) is the former rhythm guitarist of Drake's band, appearing in four episodes in Season 1. He and Rina caused Drake peer pressure in "Grammy", when they had concert tickets to Rock Shock, the concert that Drake is not allowed to attend. Scottie got them detained because he photocopied their tickets. Scottie, Rina, and Paul were never seen or mentioned again after that.
Gary.
Gary (Dan Mott) is the goofy and self-absorbed drummer of Drake's band. He has a tattoo of a foot on his chest and likes to wear shirts with pandas on them. He only appeared in "The Storm".
Julio.
Julio (Shiloh Fernandez) is the current bassist of Drake's band. He only appeared in "The Storm" but he is mentioned in "Josh Runs Into Oprah".
Neil Kramer.
Neil Kramer (Ridge Canipe) is an 11 year old 5th Grader who appears in "Megan's New Teacher" who played the Drums for Drake when his original drummer left. Drake noticed his talent for drums when he found him playing a song on books with pencils in the classroom. After that he took him home to hear him play and Drake wanted to have play in the band. However when Josh handed out pop quizzes that everyone failed because they didn't do homework, Neil's mom banned him from playing. Drake and Megan hatched a plan to get Josh fired; it worked, leading to Neil playing for Drake's band at the Premiere's third anniversary. Neil was never seen again after that, probably because he is in Megan's grade and was most likely only a one time member.
Other members.
In addition to the members mentioned above, Drake was seen performing in the Season 2 episode "Blues Brothers" with several other boys who were never named. They are never seen again afterwords.
Musical style and influences.
Even though their main musical style is never revealed in the show, it is presumed that their main genres are power pop (as evidenced in the song "The Girl Next Door"), alternative rock (as evidenced in the song "Hollywood Girl"), pop rock (as evidenced in the song "Makes Me Happy"), blues rock (as evidenced in "Old, Cranky Josh"), pop punk (as evidenced in the song "I Found a Way"), and post-grunge (as evidenced in the song "Don't Preach"). Possible influences for the band are Sparks (mentioned frequently in the series), Zero Gravity, and Aerosmith (the "Just Push Play" album sleeve is seen frequently in the series).

Distributed transmission system

In North American digital terrestrial television broadcasting, a distributed transmission system (DTS or DTx) is a form of single-frequency network in which a single broadcast signal is fed via microwave, landline, or communications satellite to multiple synchronised terrestrial radio transmitter sites. The signal is then simultaneously broadcast on the same frequency in different overlapping portions of the same coverage area, effectively combining many small transmitters to generate a broadcast area rivalling that of one large transmitter or to fill gaps in coverage due to terrain or localised obstacles.
History.
While the idea of a single-frequency network of multiple transmitters broadcasting the same programming on the same channel from multiple transmitter sites is not a new concept, the ATSC digital television standard in use in North America was not designed for this mode of operation and was poorly adapted to these applications. The restrictive timing requirements and poor multipath interference handling of early ATSC implementations would have precluded multiple synchronous transmitters on the same frequency at the time of the first wide-scale commercial ATSC deployment in 1998; these restrictions eased somewhat as receiver design advanced in subsequent years. By 2004, technology existed to provide digital television receivers with the means to detect static (not mobile or changing) multipath interference (subject to certain timing constraints) and compensate for its effects on the digital signal.
Tests have been run by various individual broadcasters or broadcast groups, including the Metropolitan Television Alliance (MTVA, a consortium of New York city television stations). A series of initial tests involving four distributed transmission sites and over 100 test measurement sites in NYC and New Jersey were completed in June 2008, along with smaller-scale tests in New York in 2007. The New York market is uniquely problematic for multipath reception due to the large number of man-made obstacles which prevent adequate digital coverage of the entire city from the main broadcast facilities atop the Empire State Building. (The proposed 1776-foot Freedom Tower has not yet been constructed, and the 2009 US DTV transition has already been completed.)
Technical issues.
To the receiver, a signal from a single-frequency network appears as a single broadcast with strong multipath interference; in the worst case, it is detected as a main signal and a reflection both of equal strength as signals arrive from multiple transmitters to the same intermediate location at slightly different times.
The ATSC standard used for digital television in North America, unlike the DVB-T standard in Europe and other nations, uses 8VSB instead of OFDM—a modulation which allowed a station to transmit at lower peak power levels, but which historically has been far inferior in handling multipath reflections and RF interference.
The first widespread commercial deployment of US ATSC digital television began in 1998, with the first early adopters being stations in the largest markets (including New York city, served by transmitters atop the World Trade Center). Digital receivers of this era, while expensive, were poorly equipped to deal with reflected signals—a severe drawback in urbanised environments. Later generations of receiver design significantly mitigated these limitations; by 2004 technology existed to build receivers capable of detecting and compensating for static multipath interference conditions where a single echo was 10dB weaker (within a 30 microsecond time difference) or the same strength (the worst case, but within a 12 microsecond range).
If the transmitters could be kept at sufficiently precise synchronisation and sufficiently close geographical spacing to operate within these limits, a single-frequency network using the new receiver design would be possible even with the existing North American ATSC digital broadcast standards.
Tests by Pennsylvania State University public educational WPSX-TV (now WPSU-TV) were initially made in 2003 WPSU was in analog a VHF 3 station which serves State College, Pennsylvania from a distant transmitter which must also cover Johnstown and Altoona. As a digital station, WSPU had used a large UHF 15 transmitter at the location of the original low-VHF broadcast tower, leading to localised problems with terrain shielding which interfered with UHF reception in State College itself. Relocation of the main transmitter would have interfered with the station's ability to serve the other two communities. Addition of a small (50 kW) synchronised digital TV transmitter in State College, on the same frequency as the main UHF 15 signal, proved a means to improve reception; further improvements would be possible by adding small co-channel 50 kW transmitters in each community to be served.
ATSC released standards on September 25, 2004 as guidance on the design of multiple transmitters, single frequency networks and multiple frequency networks. The new 2004 standards included:
Technical issues addressed included that of synchronization between transmitters (GPS was used to supply a 1 Hz and a 10 MHz reference frequency, as well as timing information) and precise control of transmitted frequencies (to within 1 Hz). Identification for each individual transmitter needed to be embedded in the signal for troubleshooting purposes, yet the main data stream on every synchronised transmitter must be identical; this is done by adding a second, low bit rate spread spectrum signal 27-30dB weaker than the main signal. As this "watermark" identifier is buried under the stronger main signal, multiple repetitions of this same identifier could be received and summed in order to provide a readable version of the watermark to broadcast technicians. A standard receiver, meanwhile, would see the same signal from all transmitters by design.
The generation of non-MPEG data carried as part of the transport layer (such as the position of transmitted frame sync, or the initial state of trellis encoding devices) would also have to be matched exactly between every synchronized transmitter. Even though this data is discarded after the received signal is demodulated, any mismatch could create interference between the various co-channel signals. An extra “operations and maintenance” distributed transmission packet (OMP, packet identifier PID:0x1FFA) would need to be added to the ATSC data at the studio and used to control various parameters needed for configuration and synchronization of the individual transmitters.
The location, directional pattern and power levels for each of the transmitters would also have to be very carefully chosen, as the ATSC system is subject to very strict limits on the maximum time difference between arrival of multiple versions of the same signal at the receiver. In problem reception areas, significant improvements could be obtained but careful design would be required to operate multiple co-channel transmitters without destructive interference.
Further tests run by Telemundo owned-and-operated station WNJU-TV, Ion TV and broadcast tower owner Richland Towers using one main New Jersey transmitter and a Times Square fill-in DTS secondary transmitter in 2007 indicated that, of fifteen test sites for reception of the station in New York city, 40% would obtain a substantial improvement in signal by the addition of a second transmitter to the existing station, while all but one would receive at least the same signal quality as was observed without a distributed transmission system. New York's Metropolitan Television Alliance was to run similar tests, but on a larger scale, in 2007 and 2008.
Regulatory issues.
While the US Federal Communications Commission has supported DTS in principle since 2004, an FCC call for public comment at the end of 2005 garnered a wide spectrum of responses in early 2006, ranging from strong support by groups such as the National Association of Broadcasters to widespread opposition by groups who advocate the free use of "white spaces" (unused broadcast frequencies) for non-broadcast purposes such as wireless data.
The FCC granted six-month special technical authority to WTVE Reading, Pennsylvania in December 2006, allowing it to operate a distributed transmission system on an experimental basis but did not authorise the systems on any permanent, licensed basis at that time.
An FCC-sponsored test market exercise in Wilmington, North Carolina shut down all analogue full-power commercial broadcasts at noon on September 8, 2008. While a large number of the resulting calls from viewers were straightforward questions about installation of antennas and converters, or the need to scan for channels before being able to watch digital television, hundreds more were about a more intractable problem. Viewers of longtime full-power low-VHF broadcasters like WECT (NBC 6 Wilmington), a signal which in its analogue form reached to the edge of Myrtle Beach, could no longer receive the station - even with the converter and proper antenna installation. The move to UHF 44 and a different transmitter site had substantially reduced WECT's coverage area and, for many who for many years were on the fringes of the analogue NBC 6 signal, WECT was no more.
On November 7, 2008 the FCC issued an order approving the use of distributed transmission systems by terrestrial DTV broadcasters, subject to various restrictions. This allows broadcasters to apply for DTS facilities to cover the area once covered by analogue TV, while not expanding coverage beyond the existing analogue coverage area. It also prohibits a broadcaster "cherry picking" a coverage area in such a way as to cover urban areas while leaving rural viewers with no signal.
This waiver has come too late to allow the newly proposed DTS facilities to be constructed and operational before the federally mandated 2009 analogue shutoff.
The Consumer Electronics Association and CTIA proposed in December 2009 to force all stations to use this method, so that the companies they represent could use the remaining space in the TV band for mobile broadband. Unlike the digital television transition in the United States, they do not propose that stations be forced to pay for it however, much like the 2 GHz broadcast auxiliary service was forced to move by the FCC, but only after the beneficiary (Sprint Nextel) compensated broadcasters for the regulatory taking.
Individual broadcasters.
In Puerto Rico, Spanish language independent WSTE 7 "Super Siete" currently operates multiple analogue transmitters on the same frequency to cover various portions of the same island; this system has shown limitations due to interference between the transmitters if all are operational simultaneously. Use of a properly synchronised digital DTS could help to reduce this interference.
In Pennsylvania, independent WTVE is licensed to serve Reading even though its primary audience is in Philadelphia. A distributed transmission system now allows it to tailor its coverage area to improve coverage in areas where its signal is currently marginal.
In Virginia public television WVPT/WVPY operate a combined total of five additional on-channel synchronised transmitters to fill areas blocked by mountains from two main VHF/UHF transmitters; a set of US$100,000 synchronised digital transmitters can replace service from the same number of conventional analogue broadcast translators and also enable overnight datacasting of instructional materials to the area's 188 schools.
In New Mexico, Telemundo affiliate KTDO proposes DTS as a means of pairing a low-power DTV facility currently operating in its community of license (Las Cruces) with a second facility atop a mountain overlooking El Paso, Texas in order to reach a wider audience.
In Missouri, FOX affiliate KRBK operates a DTS as a way to service the Springfield, Missouri market from 5 transmission points based around the Springfield DMA. This system went on air in late 2011, and is still being revised today.
In Alaska, Anchorage MyTV affiliate KYES-TV operates with limited resources and equipment, covering a large and sparsely populated area with many small broadcast translator stations. While broadcast signal synchronization is not an issue (as the overlap between signals falls entirely into unpopulated areas), the ability to re-use multiple small transmitters may allow the station to avoid the cost of building one large, expensive main transmitter for its digital signal.

Brazilian–Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials

The Brazilian–Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC; ; ) is a binational safeguards agency playing an active role in the verification of the peaceful use of nuclear materials that could be used, either directly or indirectly, for the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction.
Nuclear cooperation between Argentina and Brazil traces back to 1986 with the signature of a protocol about immediate sharing of information and mutual assistance in case of nuclear accidents and radiological emergencies The warm personal relationship that existed between Argentina's democratically elected president Raul Alfonsin and his Brazilian counterpart, Joao Figueiredo, further catalyzed the deepening of relations which is now understood to have begun under their authoritarian predecessors.
The ABACC was created on June 18, 1991 and is the only binational safeguards organization existing in the world and the first binational organization created by Argentina and Brazil. 
As a regional agency dealing with safeguards, its main goal is guaranteeing Argentina, Brazil and the international community that all the nuclear materials are used exclusively for peaceful purposes.

Cinema of Bihar

Bihar has a robust cinema industry for the Hindi and Bhojpuri language. There ware also a small Maithili, Angika and Magadhi film industry.
History.
Although Bihar has produced a few Hindi films, it specializes in Bhojpuri films. The first Bhojpuri Film was 'Ganga Maiya Tohe Piyari Chhadhaibo' released in 1963, although Bhojpuri and Maghi dialects were used in a few earlier films such as Ganga-Jamuna and Nadiya Ke Paar. This, and a few others that followed, such as Lage Nahin Chhute Ram and Bideshiya were super-hit films in the Bhojpuri belt.(Input by R N Dash,President, Cine Society, Patna)
Lagi nahin chute ram" was the all time super hit Bhojpuri film which was released against "Mugle Azam" but was a super hit in all the eastern and northern sector. Bollywood's Nadiya Ke Paar is among the most famous Bhojpuri language movie. The first Maithili movie was "Kanyadan" released in 1965, of which a significant portion was made in the Maithili language, where as Bhauji Maay is one of the popular Maithili movie . Bhaiyaa a Magadhi film was released in 1961.
Bhojpuri Poet Manoj Bhawuk is a single person who has written History of Bhojpuri Cinema.
Golden Era.
Cinema in Bihar dates back to the early years of 20th Century when J F Madan acquired the then Elphinstone Theatre Co of Bombay in 1902 and converted it into The Elphinstone Bioscope Co. The Elphinstone Theatre of Patna was accordingly converted into Elphinstone cinema, and started showing short silent films. On advent of Talkies, it started showing sound films and continuing till now, although has changed its ownership after collapse of the Madan empire in 1930s. In between, another silent cinema theatre was built in China Kothi, Patna, which withered away after advent of talkies from 1931 onwards. The first talkie of Patna was built in Babu Bazar, South-West Patna, debuting with the Talkie "Veer Abhimanyu" in 1933 or 1934, But the nitrate films caused a huge fire that destroyed the theatre, which was never re-built.
The first Feature film produced in Bihar was perhaps "Punarmilan", produced by the Maharaja of Deo in Aurangabad district, reported to have been directed by Dhirendranath Ganguly (maker of Bilat Ferat). But no trace or confirmed information is available about this film.
After several decades Prakash Jha made his debut Feature film Hip Hip Huray in 1984, a Hindi film, completely shot in Bihar (now Jharkhand) but processed in Bombay. The next producer was Sahay from Gaya, who made the feature film Patang directed by the eminent Gautam Ghose.
The first Bhojpuri film Ganga Maiya Tohe Piyari Chhadhaibo was made in 1962 by Raj Kumar Sahabadi, Directed by Kundan Kumar of Varanasi. The film was certified by the Censors in November 1962 and was released in Varanasi and Patna in early 1963. Acclaimed as a very well made film with many popular artists, this encouraged announcement of production of about 70 films, most of whom did not materialize. Although a large number of films have been produced in Bhojpuri, only a few have been admired, most of them rejected for family viewing. With poor commercial prospects, more than 150 completed films are waiting to be released (by May 2012). We are still waiting for the Golden Era to arrive.
Festival.
Patna Film Festival is an international film festival. Participant countries includes Iran, Canada, China, Japan, Sweden, Germany, Russia, USA and India . "Patna Film Festival" started in 2006. It was jointly organized by of Union ministry of information and broadcasting, National Film Development Corporation (NFDC), directorate of film festival, National Film Archive of India, Federation of Film Societies of India and the state government.
Earlier, Mini Film Festivals (read Film sessions) used to be organized regularly by Cine-Society, Patna during the summer and winter seasons during the year 1973 to 1989, the last being on Charlie Chaplin films during world-wide celebration of his centenary. Cine society also helped Government of India and a few other cultural organizations such as the Bihar Art Theater who organized a few such festivals during this period. But like most film Societies of the world Cine society, Patna also faced its bad days on advent of Video, TV and Satellite Channels from 1980s onwards, compelling to restrict their activities due to sudden downfall of patrons, members and funds (yet the society is active with its fewer members, screening around 12 feature and 4 documentary films from all over the world regularly every month, organizing Film Appreciation Workshops and discussions regularly and bringing out a monthly Newsletter regularly since the last 28 years. It is helping Government and a few other organizations in organizing one or two mini Film Festivals every year).

History Of Maithili Films: A Bird’s Eye View
Of all the languages of India Maithili is considered to be the sweetest and most cultured. It is needless to point out that Maithili is spoken by about 6 -7 crores of the people of not only India but abroad also. The most significant characteristic feature of this sweet language is that it has its own grammar, literature, culture, customs, almanac and geographical area. Maithili language is known all over the world for its sweetness, classical epics, melodious songs of Poet Vidyapati and what not. In the light of all this riches possessed by Maithili that it has been accorded a place in the Constitution of India.
As far as Maithili cinema is considered, it has remained till date at a back foot which is a matter of utter shame and serious concern for all the Maithils. However, some people have tried their best to heip Maithili cinema get its due. 
The first released Maithili movie was Kanyadan (released in 1965 & Directed by Phani Majumdar), of which a significant portion was made in the Maithili language. The film's story in which the protagonist doesn't know Maithili language but decided to learn Maithili as his wife knows only Maithili language. It is based on the novel KANYADAAN by Harimohan Jha.
Another maithili movie "Mamta Gaave Geet" directed by C. Parmanand, was released in 1984-85 and became very popular due to the melodious songs and good storyline. 
Anand Mishra tried to revive it with his tele film “ Ijot” which depicts the hard reality of the youths of Mithilanchal. But unfortunately this films remained incomplete and could not be released. In this film Udit Narayan also gave his voice. It is to be noted that even before “ Ijot”, Anand Mishra also had come with a Maithili video “ Ena Katay Din”.
Then came yet another superhit film “Sasta Jinagai Mahag Sinur”, released in 1999, which went a long way in revival of Maithili film Industries. Muarli Dhar, a great Director, Music composer, Singer, actor has directed this film. Moreover, Balkrishna Jha’s contribution in this film can also not be ruled out. All the songs of this movie sung by Md Aziz, Sadhana Sargam and Udit Narayan, Deepa Narayan became super hit, breaking all success records. This maithili film's songs are still played in many village fairs and other Maithil gatherings.
Another Maithili film "Kakhan Harab Dukh Mor" based on life of great Maithil Poet Vidyapati proved yet another milestone in the history of Maithili Cinema with its success and response from the audiences. Thanks to excellent performance by actor Phool Singh who played the role of Vidyapati and great music and soulful songs by Gyaneshwar Dubey the film became a huge hit.
"Senurak Laaj" and "Dularua Babu" are other great Maithili films. Details of these films will be given in due course.
Aau Piya Hamar Nagari presented by Ashu-Priya Production was released in 2000.Unfortunately the movie could not get success as expected in spite of brilliant plot and narrative technique. 90% of the picturisation of this film was executed in the direction of popular Director Murli Dhar. Dr Manikant Mishra had later declared himself the Director of the film due to a small strife.
In 2007 November another Maithili film Sindurdan was released but the film was quickly withdrawn from theatres due to some sound problem.
The feature film, "Senuriya", directed by B.D. Prasad Chaudhary, music by Gyaneshwar Dubey, is a two-and-a-half hour film, made by Ayushman Films. Surya and Diva Shree play the lead role as actors with Rami Reddy in a negative role. In fact, it is a film dubbed from Tamil into Maithili.
Garibak Beti - 2005, Banner Dev Kala Arts & A Y Movies, a movie based on dowry system and produced by the young Ajay Yash, aged 22 Years, was a widely viewed successful film. It was a low budget movie but the box office collection was high. Though low budget, technically this movie fulfilled all demands of the audience and attracted attention to maithili cinema. The next production of Ajay Yash Was 'Mayak Karz', 2010, under the banner of Dev Kala Arts & A Y Movies. Ajay Yash has started a new project as producer and director in 'Babujee'. The movie is expected on screen in 2012. Ajay Yash is the sole producer and director who is struggling for Maithili Cinema, continuously.
"Ek Chutki Sindur", "Chat Mangani Patt Bhel Biyah", "Khurluchchi" are presently in the lab and likely to be released shortly .
The year 2011 witnessed the successful release of two Maithili films ' Sajana Ke Anagana Me Solah Singaar ' Directed by Murli Dhar and "Mukhiya Jee" directed by Vikash Jha. 
By creating Maithili Films Group and maithili cinema blog on various sites Bhaskaranand Jha Bhaskar is doing a commendable job for popularising Maithili films.

Sweet Thing (Keith Urban song)

"Sweet Thing" is a song co-written and recorded by Australian country music singer Keith Urban. The song is the first single from his album "Defying Gravity". It was released on 3 November 2008, and it made its debut on the Hot Country Songs charts at number 30, becoming Urban's nineteenth Top 40 country hit. On the chart week of 14 March 2009, it became Urban's tenth number one country hit. It went on to win the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, which was Urban's third win in that category. The song was written by Urban and Monty Powell.
Content.
"Sweet Thing" is an up-tempo country pop song. The male narrator sings of their first dates together, including meeting "in the backyard under the cottonwood tree" and "kissin' on the porch swing", as well as the lover exiting the house through her bedroom window "while the world's sleeping." The lyrics were inspired by Urban's relationship with his Ford Mustang, which is seen in this song's music video. Urban recorded the song at The Castle Recording Studios in Franklin, Tennessee.
Reception.
Jim Malec, a reviewer for The 9513, gave "Sweet Thing" a "thumbs up" rating. Although he considered the song "not really country" he added "If this is country-pop, it is hard to imagine anyone ever doing it with more passion, more intensity, and more effectiveness." Malec also noted Urban's "emotionally committed" vocals. It appears in the video game "Tap Tap Revenge 2".
Music video.
The music video for "Sweet Thing" was directed by Trey Fanjoy. It premiered on 19 January 2009 and was shot in a barn in Spring Hill, Tennessee. Originally, they were to shoot outside, but it was too rainy, so they were forced to use the farm. The acting scenes were also shot in Spring Hill. The Ford Mustang seen in the barn is Keith's own.

Flag of Bavaria

There are officially "two" flags of Bavaria: the striped type, and the lozenge type, both of which are white and blue. Both flags are historically associated with the royal Bavarian Wittelsbach family, which ruled Bavaria. 
Overview.
Both horizontal and vertical flags with stripes or white and blue lozenges without arms can be considered official for use as state and civil flag and as civil ensign (on lakes and rivers). The variants defaced with the arms are not only unofficial, but not considered legal. However, the de facto used civil flag is in most cases a lozenge-style flag with the arms and a very popular symbol of regional pride used and displayed throughout the state.
The exact shade of blue has never been set in stone, but most flags used by the public are approximately RGB 0-204-255; official use something closer to RGB 0-128-255. The lonzenges are neither set in number, except there must be at least 21, and the top right (incomplete) lozenge must be white. Some people believe the lozenges to be representative of the lakes and rivers of Bavaria; or their color to be that of the lakes or the sky or both (as in the Bavarian anthem, which says 'die Farben Seines Himmels, Weiß und Blau' - 'the colors of His sky/heaven, white and blue'); but this has never been proven. The other argument is that they are historical.

Infernal (Swedish band)

"Not to be confused with the Infernal from Kristianstad."
Infernal was an influential Swedish black metal band based in Stockholm. It was formed in 1997, mainly by David Parland 
(Blackmoon), who quickly teamed up with ex-Dark Funeral colleague and vocalist Themgoroth (Paul Mäkitalo), to create a band both similar to and more brutal and extreme than Dark Funeral, which Blackmoon had left in mid 1996.
The band saw the participation of several members like Matte Modin (ex-Dark Funeral, Defleshed) and Impious of In Aeternum among others. The last known line-up was Blackmoon (David Parland) - guitars, Typhos (Henke Ekeroth) - vocals and guitars and Alzazmon (Tomas Asklund) - drums - this was the second real line-up, and it was dissolved in 2003.
David Parland re-formed the band in late 2008 with drummer Asklund. Infernal's new musical direction showcases a slightly more accessible sound than the first two Infernal EPs, and the new musical direction is more along older death/black metal and not as blastbeat-oriented as the old Infernal. This line-up introduces David as a vocalist as well as guitarist. 
The line-up was planned to be expanded to a full band in time for the planned full-length album and possible live gigs.
On July 14, 2009, it was revealed that Infernal had parted ways for good with drummer Tomas Asklund.
A replacement in the form of Norwegian drummer Carl Engström from Astaroth and Recovery Injection has been found, and was announced on October 17. 
Old Necrophobic colleague and guitarist Martin Halfdan has also joined the band as a live and lead/solo guitarist mainly. 
On May 2, 2010, Colombian underground cult label Goathorned Productions released the 3-track Infernal EP "The Infernal Return".
This release features 3 tracks recorded early 2009, with David on guitars, bass and lead vocals. Tomas Asklund (Gorgoroth, Dawn) played session drums on this EP.
A demo entitled "Hellhymns" featured four tracks; it was the last recording before a full-length album, scheduled for release in late 2010 or early 2011.
On March 19, 2013, founder David Parland died, putting an end to the band.

Bedford Master

The Bedford Master was an manuscript illuminator active in Paris during the fifteenth century. He is named for the work he did on two books illustrated for John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford between 1415 and 1435. One is the Bedford Hours, a book of hours in the British Library (Add. MS 18850); the other, a breviary, is in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Another manuscript is in the Royal Collection. The Bedford Master is known to have been the head of a workshop; his chief assistant is known as the Chief Associate of the Bedford Master.
Recent scholarship has tended to move from talking about the "Bedford Master" to the "Bedford Workshop" and even the Bedford Trend, a term introduced by Millard Meiss in 1967, which includes a wider period leading up to the key Bedford works. A "Master of the Bedford Trend" has also been attributed with some works. One possible candidate for the identity of the Bedford Master is "Haincelin of Hagenau" in Alsace, who was recorded in Paris between 1403 and 1424, and was perhaps the father of "Jean Haincelin", active between at least 1438 and 1449, and was perhaps the "Dunois Master" who has been given a group of late Bedford-style manuscripts.

Foreign relations of the Holy See

The Holy See—as distinguished from the city-state of the Vatican City—has long been recognised as a subject of international law and as an active participant in international relations. It remains such, and indeed one observer has said that its interaction with the world has, in the period since World War II, been at the highest point it has ever had.
The diplomatic activities of the Holy See are directed by the Secretariat of State (headed by the Cardinal Secretary of State), through the Section for Relations with States.
History.
Since medieval times the episcopal see of Rome has been recognized as a sovereign entity. Earlier, there were papal representatives to the Emperors of Constantinople, beginning in 453, but they were not thought of as ambassadors. In the eleventh century the sending of papal representatives to princes, on a temporary or permanent mission, became frequent. In the fifteenth century it became customary for states to accredit permanent resident ambassadors to the Pope in Rome. The first permanent papal nunciature was established in 1500 in Venice. Their number grew in the course of the sixteenth century to thirteen, while internuncios (representatives of second rank) were sent to less-powerful states. After enjoying a brilliant period in the first half of the seventeenth century, papal diplomacy declined after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, being assailed especially by royalists and Gallicans, and the number of functioning nuncios was reduced to two in the time of Napoleon, although in the same period, in 1805, Prussia became the first Protestant state to send an ambassador to Rome. There was a revival after the Congress of Vienna, which, while laying down that, in general, the order of precedence between ambassadors would be determined by the date of their arrival, allowed special precedence to be given to the nuncio, by which he would always be the dean of the diplomatic corps.
In spite of the extinction of the Papal States in 1870, and the consequent loss of territorial sovereignty, and in spite of some uncertainty among jurists as to whether it could continue to act as an independent personality in international matters, the Holy See continued in fact to exercise the right to send and receive diplomatic representatives, maintaining relations with states that included the major powers of Russia, Prussia and Austria-Hungary. Countries continued to receive nuncios as diplomatic representatives of full rank, and where, in accordance with the decision of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the Nuncio was not only a member of the Diplomatic Corps but its Dean, this arrangement continued to be accepted by the other ambassadors.
With the First World War and its aftermath the number of states with diplomatic relations with the Holy See increased. For the first time since relations were broken between the Pope and Queen Elizabeth I of England, a British diplomatic mission to the Holy See was opened in 1914. The result was that, instead of diminishing, the number of diplomats accredited to the Holy See grew from sixteen in 1871 to twenty-seven in 1929, even before it again acquired territorial sovereignty with the founding of the State of Vatican City.
In the same period, the Holy See concluded a total of twenty-nine concordats and other agreements with states, including Austro-Hungary in 1881, Russia in 1882 and 1907, France in 1886 and 1923. Two of these concordats were registered at the League of Nations at the request of the countries involved.
While bereft of territorial sovereignty, the Holy See also accepted requests to act as arbitrator between countries, including a dispute between Germany and Spain over the Caroline Islands.
The Lateran Treaty of 1929 and the founding of the Vatican City State was not followed by any great immediate increase in the number of states with which the Holy See had official relations. This came later, especially after the Second World War.
Bilateral relations.
The Holy See, as a non-state sovereign entity and full subject of international law, started establishing diplomatic relations with sovereign states in the 15th century. It had the territory of the States of the Church under its direct sovereign rule since centuries before that time. Currently it has the territory of the State of the Vatican City under its direct sovereign rule. In the period of 1870-1929 between the annexation of Rome by the Kingdom of Italy and the ratification of the Lateran Treaty establishing the current Vatican City State, the Holy See was devoid of territory. In this period some states suspended their diplomatic relations, but others retained them (or established such relations for the first time or reestablished them after a break), so that the number of states that did have diplomatic relations with the Holy See almost doubled (from 16 to 27) in the period between 1871 and 1929.
The Holy See currently has diplomatic relations with 179 sovereign states (including the partially internationally recognized Republic of China) and in addition with the sovereign entity Order of Malta and the supranational union European Union.
The Holy See also has established official non-diplomatic relations "of special nature" with the Palestine Liberation Organization. By agreement with the government of Vietnam, it has a non-resident papal representative to that country. It has official formal contacts, without establishing diplomatic relations, with: Afghanistan, Brunei, Somalia, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.
The Holy See additionally maintains some apostolic delegates to local Catholic Church communities and such delegates are not accredited to the governments of the respective states and work only in unofficial non-diplomatic capacity. The regions and states where such non-diplomatic delegates operate are: Brunei, Comoros, Laos, Mauritania, Myanmar, Somalia, Vietnam, Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories (Palestine), Pacific Ocean (Tuvalu, dependent territories), Arabian Peninsula (Oman, foreigners in Saudi Arabia), Antilles (dependent territories), apostolic delegate to Kosovo (Republic of Kosovo) and the apostolic prefecture of Western Sahara (Sahrawi Republic)
The Holy See has no relations of any kind with the following states: 
The Holy See maintains 180 permanent diplomatic missions abroad, of which 73 are non-residential, so that it has in all 106 concrete missions, some of which are accredited not only to the country in which they are situated, but also to one or more other countries or international organizations.
The Holy See is the only European subject of international law to have diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan), although informal talks between the Holy See and the government of the People's Republic of China on the reestablishment of diplomatic relations have been reported.
During the pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI relations were established Montenegro (2006), the United Arab Emirates (2007), Botswana (2008), the Russian Federation (2009), Malaysia (2011) and South Sudan (2013). "Relations of a special nature" had previously been in place with Russia similar to those that continue to exist with the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
Multilateral politics.
Participation in international organizations.
The Holy See is active in international organizations and is a member of the following groups:
The Holy See is also a permanent observer of the following international organizations:
The Holy See is an observer on an informal basis of the following groups:
The Holy See sends a delegate to the Arab League in Cairo. It is also a guest of honour to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Activities of the Holy See within the United Nations system.
Since 6 April 1964, the Holy See has been a "permanent observer state" at the United Nations. In that capacity, the Holy See has since had a standing invitation attend all the sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, and the United Nations Economic and Social Council to observe their work, and to maintain a permanent observer mission at the UN headquarters in New York. Accordingly, the Holy See has established a Permanent Observer Mission in New York, has sent representatives to all open meetings of the General Assembly and of its Main Committees and has been able to influence their decisions and recommendations.
Relationship with Vatican City.
Although the Holy See is closely associated with Vatican City, the independent territory over which the Holy See is sovereign, the two entities are separate and distinct.
The State of the Vatican City was created by the Lateran Treaty in 1929 to "ensure the absolute and visible independence of the Holy See" and "to guarantee to it an indisputable sovereignty in international affairs" (quotations from the treaty). Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, the Holy See's former Secretary for Relations with States, said that the Vatican City is a "minuscule support-state that guarantees the spiritual freedom of the Pope with the minimum territory".
The Holy See, not Vatican City, maintains diplomatic relations with states, and foreign embassies are accredited to the Holy See, not to Vatican City State. It is the Holy See that establishes treaties and concordats with other sovereign entities and likewise, generally, it is the Holy See that participates in international organizations, with the exception of those dealing with technical matters of clearly territorial character:
Under the terms of the Lateran Treaty, the Holy See has extraterritorial authority over various sites in Rome and two Italian sites outside of Rome, including the Pontifical Palace at Castel Gandolfo. The same authority is extended under international law over the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See in a foreign country.
Diplomatic representations to the Holy See.
Of the diplomatic missions accredited to the Holy See, 69 are situated in Rome, although those countries, if they also have an embassy to Italy, then have two embassies in the same city, since, by agreement between the Holy See and Italy, the same person cannot at the same time be accredited to both. The United Kingdom recently housed its embassy to the Holy See in the same building as its embassy to the Italian Republic, a move that led to a diplomatic protest from the Holy See. An ambassador accredited to a country other than Italy can be accredited also to the Holy See. For reasons of economy, therefore, smaller countries accredit to the Holy See a mission situated elsewhere and accredited also to the country of residence and perhaps other countries.
Massimo Franco, author of "Parallel Empires", asserted in April 2009 that the Obama administration had put forward three candidates for consideration but each of them have been deemed insufficiently pro-life by the Vatican. This claim was denied by the Holy See's spokesman Federico Lombardi, and was dismissed by Thomas Patrick Melady, former United States Ambassador to the Holy See, as being in conflict with diplomatic practice. Vatican sources said that it is not the practice to vet the personal ideas of those who are proposed as ambassadors to the Holy See, though in the case of candidates who are Catholics and who are living with someone, their marital status is taken into account. Divorced people who are not Catholics can in fact be accepted, provided their marriage situation is in accord with the rules of their own religion.
In September 2008, French and Italian press reports likewise claimed that the Holy See had refused the required diplomatic approval of several candidates proposed by Paris for the job, which has been vacant since the previous ambassador died in December 2007.
According to press accounts in Argentina in January 2008, the country's nominee as ambassador to the Holy See, Alberto Iribarne, a Catholic, was rejected on the grounds that he was living with a woman other than the wife from whom he was divorced.
Treaties and Concordats.
Since the Holy See is legally capable of ratifying international treaties, and does ratify them, it has negotiated numerous bilateral treaties with states and it has been invited to participate - on equal footing with States - in the negotiation of most universal International law-making treaties. Traditionally, an agreement between the Holy See of the Catholic Church and a sovereign state on religious matters is called a concordat. This often includes both recognition and privileges for the Catholic Church in a particular country, such as exemptions from certain legal matters and processes, and issues such as taxation as well as the right of a state to influence the selection of bishops within its territory.

Shequ

Shequ (Chinese: 社区) are community institutions, consisting of participating citizens and chiefs, the latter ones being installed by the central governance. Shequ represent an attempt to restructure the relationship between state and urban community in China.
The social anthropologist Fei Xiaotong is considered the first to have proposed the introduction of the idea of shequ in China. The introduction of shequ started after the collapse of the previously existing social institutions ("Danwei") during the mid-1990s. Shequ were supposed to relieve the state of certain duties and responsibilities by transferring them to citizens participating in the shequ. They take over responsibilities which in democratic states are assumed by organisations of the civil community.

The priapum fishes are a family, Phallostethidae, of atheriniform fish native to freshwater and brackish habitats in southeast Asia.
They are small, no more than in length, with partially translucent bodies. They are found in fresh and brackish water from Thailand to the Philippines and Sulawesi. They are named for a muscular organ found under the chin of males. This organ, which may possess small testicles, is used together with the pelvic fins to grasp the female during mating. Unlike most other fish, priapum fishes exhibit internal fertilisation.

Master of Castelsardo

The Master of Castelsardo was an Italian painter active in Sardinia at the end of the 15th and the beginning of the sixteenth century. His name comes from a painting of the Madonna and Child currently in the cathedral of Castelsardo. 
His influence appears to be primarily Catalan and he perhaps started painting in Barcelona around 1490; some scholars have identified him with Gioacchino Cavaro, though others dispute this. His other works included the retablos in the church of St. Peter at Tuili (executed between 1489 and 1500), in the church of Santa Rosalia at Cagliari, the "Trinity Retablo" (like the previous one, originally commissioned for the Frasciscan convent at Tallano, in Corsica, now in the basilica of Saccargia).

The film was shot in Miami, Florida, USA. It is the only film written by twice nominated Academy Award actor John Travolta.
Travolta appears as Scott Barnes, an alcoholic turned social worker who trying to rescue a kid named Tommy (played by Lawrence) from a brutal, vicious Crack Street Gang when he finds out he has begun selling crack in an organization called YIP, run by Carlos (Benjamin Bratt). Hector Elizondo has a part as Lieutenant Ortega.
The opening credits state that Chains of Gold is "based on actual events", though details of the actual events themselves remain difficult to find and come across.

Thief River Falls Public Library

The Thief River Falls Library is a library and historic site in Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA that dates from 1900.
History.
In 1900, a few civic leaders decided that a book collection was needed for everyone to use. Money was raised for a small collection of books which were then housed in the first library, a storefront on 2nd Street, which was provided rent-free. 
In the spring of 1902, a small one-story annex was built for the library on the north side of the old City Fire Hall at the corner of First Street and Main Avenue. A Mr. L.G. Browning was hired as the first librarian that year, at the salary of $14 a month.
In 1906, the library became an official separate department of the City of Thief River Falls. When the city moved to its current location, the library also moved and was located in a large room in the basement. As the library grew, it was evident it needed more space. In 1914, the Carnegie Library was built in Thief River Falls and dedicated on May 12, 1915. The Carnegie Library provided the library with a children’s section.
Hazel Halgrim, the librarian from 1912-1913, again assumed the librarianship in 1925 and remained in the position until 1953. During this time, she implemented county outreach library service. This became a model for the state. In 1929, Pennington County became the eleventh Minnesota County to receive library service. Halgrim became so well respected among librarians in the state, that they first elected her secretary, then president, of the Minnesota Library Association. Known as "Miss Library", Frances Shanahan became the TRF librarian in 1953 and served until her death in 1965. Named one of the three 1962 Outstanding Women of Thief River Falls by the Business and Professional Women's Club, Shanahan would not live to see her two dreams-a new library, and regionalization of library services -- come to completion. 
It became apparent that the Carnegie Library was crowded and the building was in need of repairs. It was in 1966, that the library moved to its present location across the street from the Carnegie Library, which still houses the library today.
In 1968, Pennington and Red Lake counties banded together to form the Northwest Regional Library system and established the Thief River Falls Public Library as its headquarters library. The regional system helped the TRF Public Library expand its resources through interlibrary loan services, savings from bulk purchases, savings from a centralized processing and administrative staff and much more.
In 1991, during the library's 90th anniversary celebration week, the TRF Public Library automated its circulation system. In late 1994, Internet access was added. During the 90th anniversary celebration, the library board noted a number of other changes that had occurred: the library had gone from a start-up collection of 200 books to over 55,000 books in that time frame. It had also increased the formats it offered from books only to books, newspapers, magazines, videos, audios, CDs and DVDs.
The library continues to grow and develop, always keeping an eye on the original purpose of the library -- to provide informational, educational and recreational opportunities to all.
The 1914 Carnegie library building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Mynydd Graig Goch

Mynydd Graig Goch (Welsh for "Mountain of the Red Rock") is the western end peak of the Nantlle Ridge, and is a subsidiary summit of Craig Cwm Silyn. It is also the most westerly 2000 ft peak in Wales. For many years it was excluded from lists of the Welsh 2000ft hills due to a spot height of 609m on OS maps. However, this changed in 2008. After years of speculation a group of hillwalkers carried out a precise GPS survey of the peak, measuring the absolute height as 609.75 m (2000.49 ft).
Panorama and topography.
The summit is boulder strewn, crowned by several tors of rock, of which one is the true summit. The southern and western flanks consist of large boulder fields. The north-east face has steep cliffs, that form the backwall of the glacial Cwm Dulyn. Cwm Dulyn's lake Llyn Cwm Dulyn contains a population of Arctic Char. Views from the summit are extensive, overseeing Lleyn and the coast. Garnedd Goch, Mynydd Mawr, Moel Hebog and Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) are all observable.

Football career.
Sandro began his professional career with Real Madrid's B side, receiving his first-team debut on 10 September 1994 against CD Logroñés, under Jorge Valdano. He helped with 13 La Liga games in that season's successful campaign, but was soon pushed to the sidelines by another youth product, Guti.
After a stint with UD Las Palmas in the second division, Sandro dropped down to the third level in 1997, and helped Málaga CF achieve a top flight promotion in just two seasons. He played 29 matches in the latter campaign, scoring once.
In 2003, Sandro moved to Levante UD: again used regularly in his first season, for another promotion, he appeared very rarely in 2004–05's first division (only three games). The Valencian Community club was relegated and he played with it a further season.
Sandro returned to Málaga in 2006–07, with the club again in division two. After the 2008 promotion, his contract expired and he retired. Club chairman, former Madrid teammate Fernando Sanz, offered him a job as technical director which he accepted.

Plonk (wine)

Plonk is a non-specific and derogatory term used primarily in British and Australian English for wine . It is believed to come from Australian slang, in reference to "blanc" (the French word for "white"), before it became naturalised in Britain. Despite the reference to the colour white, the term is not limited to white wine, and can as easily indicate a red wine or rosé. In this context, the phrase has even spawned the title of a novel which evokes the perceived tackiness of the 1980s.
In Australia, plonk packaged and sold in a cask or simply in a bag is commonly called "goon".
Other usages.
The term is not always used in a wholly derogatory manner. It can indicate a degree of strange affection for the wine in question. "Telegraph" journalist Max Davidson has equated plonk with "youth, ... excess, ... self-indulgence in times of penury. Forget grown-up wine. With plonk, the sweetest bouquet of all is the taste of a few pence saved."
Today, the term can often be used to indicate that a particular social gathering is not a fancy affair. For example, if a party guest is worried about the social level of the occasion, a host might assuage his or her concerns with the phrase: "Oh, just bring a bottle of plonk." Indeed, probably the most famous literary use of "plonk" comes in Willy Russell's play "Educating Rita". Working-class Rita decides she cannot attend a party to which academic Frank has invited her, since she is ashamed of the wine she has bought and feels out-of-place. When Rita reports her anxieties to Frank the following week, he castigates Rita for being too self-conscious, reassuring her: "It wouldn't have mattered if you'd walked in carrying a bottle of Spanish plonk."

Richard D. Steuart

Richard D. Steuart (1880–1951) was a journalist in Baltimore, Maryland known as Carroll Dulaney, the name he used for his "Day by Day" column in the Baltimore News-Post. Steuart was also an historian focusing mainly on Maryland history and the role that Maryland played during the American Civil War. He maintained a vast collection of Civil war era firearms and assorted artifacts, many collected personally from the battlefields he visited. Much of his collection of Confederate-made edged weapons, long arms, side arms, projectiles and fuses, and accouterments were donated to the Virginia Historical Society in 1948.
Richard Steuart also contributed indirectly to the formation of Time Magazine. While he was contributing editor of the Baltimore News Post Mr. Steuart employed a young journalist by the name of Briton Hadden. Mr. Hadden had the idea to start news magazine of his own so Mr. Steuart granted him a leave of absence from the Baltimore News-Post with the promise that if the magazine should not work out that he could return to Baltimore and have his position back.
Upon his death, Richard D. Steuart was eulogized by both Maryland’s Governor Theodore McKeldin and Baltimore City’s Mayor Thomas D’Alessandro. His vast collection of news clippings and historical library was donated to the Maryland Historical Society.

Isaac Master (painter)

The Isaac Master was an Italian Gothic painter active in the decoration of the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi in Assisi at the end of the thirteenth century.
The Name.
Master's name is derived from a fresco painting of the death of Isaac for which he is known, the fresco is located in the Upper Church of St Francis at Assisi, depicting Isaac blessing Jacob and Esau.
Who Is The Master?
Much discussion has been held as to who is the Master. Some speculate that he was Gaddo di Zanobi Gaddi (due to similarity with Gaddi's work in Rome and Florence), while others say Pietro Cavallini or Giotto. 
Whomever, the Master seems to have been familiar with the Roman artists Filippo Rusuti and Jacopo Torriti, as well as with the work of Cimabue from Florence. He anticipates, by about a decade, some of the advances made by Giotto in his work; for this reason he is considered to be a central figure in the so-called "Giotto Question".

Endless Art

"Endless Art" is a song by Irish indie rock band A House, released initially as the lead track on the "Bingo" EP (1990), and then as a single from their 1991 album "I Am the Greatest". (It is also included on the greatest hits album The Way We Were.)
Endless Art.
After the commercial failure of their 1990 album "I Want Too Much", A House had been dropped from their label, to be picked up by the indie label Setanta Records. They quickly released the EPs "Doodle" and "Bingo", at the end of 1990 and in 1991. The latter included the first appearance of "Endless Art", which A House recorded with Edwyn Collins as producer. Collins went on to work with them on "I Am the Greatest" from which "Endless Art" was re-released as a single, accompanied by a video.
Although the song did not enjoy huge chart success, it reached number 46 in the UK - an achievement by A House's standards - and it gained a certain amount of airplay on MTV Europe. But for distribution problems, the song might have performed much better commercially. Yet, that one of the A House's most popular successes should be such an unusual song as "Endless Art" confirms their peculiar status as cult favourites. The lyrics to "Endless Art" begin with the line "All art is quite useless according to Oscar Wilde" and for their remainder are mostly a list of the names and birth and death dates of artists from various fields, with the chorus remark: "all dead but still alive, in endless time and endless art". This "list" style of song is characteristic of many of Dave Couse's songs. The majority of the lyrics are declaimed rather than sung, over a repetitive electric guitar motif. Melodically, the song features a quotation from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony at the chorus.
Video.
"Endless Art" was accompanied by an innovative stop-motion video which received a lot of praise. When Paul King called it quits on MTV's Greatest Hits he played the video for "Endless Art" on his final show as one "of those videos that I really do think deserve to be called great and classic", alongside others such as Thriller and Ashes to Ashes.
Sexism.
For the first appearance of the song on "Bingo", the band received some criticism for the fact that the artists listed in the song are all male, so they recorded a second version where all the artists are female. This is the version called "More Endless Art". In "More Endless Art", the melodic quoatation from Beethoven is substituted with one from Carl Orff, who, it might be quibbled, is not a woman, while the substitution of "Walt Disney's Minnie Mouse" for his Mickey Mouse may not quite right the gender balance either. Still, "More Endless Art" was better than a defence Dave Couse had offered in interviews, that the band had thought that Joan Miró "was" a woman.
Updated Art.
Dave Couse has subsequently performed a live version of "Endless Art" with a new list of artists, those deceased since the original release of the song. This is available as "Endless Art 06" on the B-Side of his single "A Celebration" (2006).

Paul Madonna

Paul Madonna (born 1972) is an American artist.
Biography.
Paul Madonna grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While still in high school he began attending art classes at Carnegie-Mellon University, where he eventually completed a B.F.A. in 1994. During his senior year of college, Madonna became the first art intern ever taken in by "Mad" magazine. Upon graduation, he moved to San Francisco and began making minicomics, which he left in public places for free. In 2004, Madonna began "All Over Coffee", which appears weekly in the "San Francisco Chronicle". He has served as "cartoonist-in-residence" artist in residence at San Francisco's Cartoon Art Museum.
Art career.
Madonna is an artist and writer with a background in painting and is best known for his series All Over Coffee, which he calls a 'strip,' a comic strip without the comic. Madonna's ink-on-paper drawings are characterized by their detailed depictions of urban cityscapes paired with stories. Madonna prefers to draw on site and straight to ink. He began with rendering his home town of San Francisco but has gone to draw, New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo and other cities. "All Over Coffee" is a weekly serial made with ink wash drawings that runs in the Sunday Datebook section of the "San Francisco Chronicle". The subject of the series originally depicted the everyday thoughts and clipped dialog of two characters, Maurice and Sarah, who are never seen in the frame, but evolved into flash fiction stories of changing and nameless characters, conversations and aphorisms. Madonna was characterized early on as writing overheard conversations, however, all of his stories are fictional. The relationship of Madonna's imagery to his stories is purposefully not literal, and is in defiance to common illustration.
Madonna is also a prolific gallery artist, showing his original work several times a year. His work has been shown in the Oakland Museum and the Contemporary Jewish Museum.
Madonna also produces a comic strip, "Small Potatoes". As with his other "alternative" works, it involves deliberately rudimentary characters, in this case potatoes.

Pieter Gerardus van Overstraten

Pieter Gerardus van Overstraten (19 February 1755, Bergen op Zoom – 22 August 1801, Batavia) was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1796 until 1801. He was the last Governor-General of the Dutch East India Company, which was dissolved, bankrupt in 1799, but he remained in post as the Dutch state took over ruling its territories in the Indies. In that sense, he was also the first state appointed Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.
Van Overstraten was appointed member-extraordinary of the "Council of Justice (Raad van Justitie)" in Batavia/Jakarta in 1780. He arrived in there in 1781. Subsequently, he was promoted to full member. In the same year, he was made interim "Advocate-Fiscal". He was made "Second Secretary" to the "High Government of the Indies" in 1784. He was promoted in 1786 to "First Secretary". He became "Counsellor-extraordinary" to the Dutch Council of the Indies in 1789. By 1791 he was Governor and Director of Java's Northeast Coast, in which post he greatly distinguished himself. During his time in the Northeast Coast, he was instrumental in getting Hamengkubuwono I established as the first Sultan of Yogyakarta. He wrote an historically important memoir for his successor containing information about that area during his term of office. 
On 16 August 1796 Pieter van Overstraten was selected as Governor-General. On 17 February 1797, Willem Arnold Alting resigned as Governor-General and Commissioner of Police ("Commissaris-General"). He handed over his offices to Van Overstaten. The appointment was confirmed in the Netherlands on 22 January 1798. When the High Government of the Indies was dissolved in 1799, he resigned as Commissioner of Police, but remained as Governor-General serving the Batavian Republic, which the Netherlands had become under Napoleon Bonaparte. He remained in post until his death in Batavia in1801. 
During Van Overstraten's term of office, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was dissolved, Ternate went into British hands, Batavia was blockaded by a British fleet, and the fortifications on the island of Onrust, and on a few other islands, destroyed.

The NMPDR was funded for five years from 2004 through a grant to co-PI's Rick Stevens from the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago, and Ross Overbeek at the Fellowship for the Interpretation of Genomes.
The NMPDR was initially tasked with annotating and curating the genomes of five pathogenic species of Bacteria, (Campylobacter, Listeria, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Vibrio). However, after four years, the team were asked to also oversee the curation and annotation of the genomes of seven additional bacterial species (Chlamydia, Chlamydophila, Haemophilus, Mycoplasma, Neisseria, Treponema, and Ureaplasma).
The flagship website, the National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource provides curated annotations in an environment for comparative analysis of genomes and biological subsystems.
In addition, the NMPDR team have also developed the Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology Server (RAST) for annotating and curating complete microbial genomes and the Metagenomics RAST for annotating metagenomes.

The Tethered Experiment for Mars inter-Planetary Operations (TEMPO³) is a CubeSat-based
satellite meant to demonstrate artificial gravity generation. After launch, the spacecraft will spin end over end to create gravity-like acceleration at both ends of a tether. The project is being run by the Mars Society, and will build from high-altitude tests to eventual orbital flight in 2011.
Background.
In the Mars Direct architecture for a humans-to-Mars mission, the crew on their way to Mars uses their discarded upper stage as a counterweight to spin end over end. This action generates gravity for the crew and prevents them from having to spend the six month trip in zero-gravity conditions. Gemini 11 and 12 showed that the concept was viable, but no gravity-related work has taken place since then using tethers.
TEMPO³ was selected as the winner of the Mars Project Challenge, run by the Mars Society in 2008, to determine the group's next major project.
Mission concept.
The spacecraft will launch with other CubeSat satellites. After separating from its carrier, TEMPO³ will spin up and then split into two parts connected by a tether. Separating will slow the spin rate, but will increase the acceleration measured at the ends. Accelerometers on board the spacecraft will sense the amount of gravity being demonstrated and will beam that data to Earth.

2008 Santa Catarina floods

The 2008 Santa Catarina floods were floods in the Santa Catarina, Brazil in November 2008. It occurred after a period of heavy rainfall during late November 2008, most significantly during days 20, 21, 22 and 23 of November. The state suffered constant rainfalls for over two months (during late September, October, and November) on the coast, which turned the soil wet enough to cause a landslide during the storm that hit the state in late November. It affected around 60 towns and over 1.5 million people in the state of Santa Catarina in Brazil. At least 128 people are confirmed to have been killed with over 78,700 being forced to evacuate their homes. A further 150,000 have been left without electricity, while water rationing is being carried out in at least one town due to purification problems. Santa Catarina state Governor Luiz Henrique da Silveira had earlier suggested that the final death toll was likely to be over 50, a figure that has proved optimistic. Several towns in the region have become cut off due to floodwater and landslide debris and on November 23 the Mayor of Blumenau, João Paulo Kleinubing, declared a state of emergency in the city. Water levels in the Vale do Itajaí have risen to eleven metres above normal.
Reactions.
Blogosphere.
Soon after the floods began, various bloggers from Blumenau began reporting about the situation on Twitter, providing photos, videos, forecast conditions and river levels for other people on the internet who were isolated by the floods. A site showed up on the Brazilian blogosphere to keep people informed and offering a channel for donations.

Ad Fontes Academy

Ad Fontes Academy (AFA) is a private, classical and Christian school. AFA teaches Kindergarten through High-school (K-12) classes. The Ad Fontes Academy provides a Classical Christian education and is located in Centreville, Virginia. AFA is accredited by the Association of Classical and Christian schools (ACCS). AFA is a nonprofit school operating under the nonprofit [501(c)(3)] National Christian Foundation for Education and The Arts Virginia Trust. Ad Fontes Academy operates at two campus locations. The lower school (K - 5) meets at Saint John’s Episcopal Church. and the upper school (6 - 12) meets at Centreville Presbyterian Church. AFA teaches from a Christ-centered, biblical Worldview.
History.
In November 1995 the National Christian Foundation for Education and The Arts Trust (NCF) was established with the goal of operating a non-denominational, academically-rigorous high school in Northern Virginia. Fundamental to NCF's goal was the belief that all labor in vain unless God directs our efforts – "nisi Dominus frustra". In September 1996, NCF opened Ad Fontes Academy (AFA). AFA recognizes that “each child is created in the image and likeness of God, the Creator, as a unique human being having a purpose for which he or she is created and is known by his deeds, by whether what he does is pure and right” and that “the knowledge and pursuit of truth, understanding and wisdom has the intended outcome of enabling the individual to fulfill the purpose for which he or she is created.”
When Ad Fontes Academy opened in September 1996, it started with 8 students in Grades 9-10. AFA graduated its first class of five seniors in June 1999. In 2000, AFA added Grades 7 and 8 to the high school program. In 2003, Kindergarten was added and Grades 1 to 6 the following year for a full K-12 program. AFA founders drew heavily on the ideas in the book "Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning" when they established the school.
Teaching methodology.
Ad Fontes Academy states that it believes in a close partnership with the student's parents. The teaching methodology is based on "The Lost Tools of Learning" and "Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning." The teachers further utilize the methods in John Milton Gregory's book "The Seven Laws of Teaching."

Henry Chesterton

Joseph Henry Chesterton (c.1840 – 26 January 1883) was a plant collector who was sent by James Veitch & Sons to search for orchids in South America with much success.
James Veitch & Sons.
Little is known of Chesterton's early life until early 1870, when, as a valet to a gentleman who was travelling through South America, he wrote to Harry Veitch from Chile stating that he had a passion for orchids and had gathered a substantial collection but needed advice on how to pack them in order to bring them back to England. Veitch replied immediately and arranged for Chesterton to meet one of his shipping agents in South America who would demonstrate the proper methods of packing the plants in order that they could be safely conveyed thousands of miles by sea, through various climates and greatly varying temperatures. 
Nothing more was heard of Chesterton for some time, until, he arrived unannounced at Veitch Nurseries' Chelsea, London headquarters. Harry Veitch and John Heal, the head nurseryman, rushed to meet him and were presented with a collection of Orchids, ""so carefully packed and well looked after, that they arrived in the best possible condition"". Veitch immediately bought all of Chesterton's plants and offered him employment as a traveller in order to obtain more new finds as orchid mania was reaching its height. After a period spent studying and working in the Veitch orchid houses he set off back to South America.
Chesterton was given specific instructions to locate and bring back to England ""the much-talked-of and long-desired "scarlet Odontoglossum"" ("Miltoniopsis vexillaria") which several collectors, including David Bowman, had previously located but had been unable to send live samples back to England, with samples often arriving at Chelsea ""dead or in a dying condition"". Chesterton eventually located the plant in the northern Cordillera Occidental in Colombia. According to the account in Hortus Veitchii:
"Provided with but the scantiest information as to the native habitat, long kept secret and shrouded in mystery, Chesterton started, and not only succeeded in discovering the plant, but safely introduced it to Chelsea, where it flowered for the first time in 1873." 
Chesterton continued to collect for Veitch over the next eight years and sent many new finds back to England, including some of the finest forms of "Odontoglossum crispum", one of which was named "Chestertonii" by Reichenbach after its discoverer: some fine Masdevallias were also sent home, including the beautiful "Masdevallia coccinea" Harryana, which Chesterton found growing in abundance in the high Sierra Nevada del Cocuy in the Colombian Andes.
Later career, death and epitaph.
Chesterton ended his employment with Veitch in 1878, and joined Veitch's principle rival Henry Sander, who sent him back to search for the "lost orchid", "Cattleya labiata" var. Vera. In 1879 he located "Paphinia rugosa" var. Sanderiana, which he named after his current employer. On his final trip, he discovered a species of "Dracula orchid", "Dracula chestertonii", which was named after him.
He died at Puerto Berrío, in the Colombian department of Antioquia on 26 January 1883. His obituary in the Shipping List of 30 January 1883 stated: 
"Mr. J. H. Chesterton, the botanist, died at Puerto Berrio on the 26th. He had been quite ill, but left the hotel ' San Nicholas,' thinking that he had sufficiently improved to be able to make his trip up the river. Sad mistake! He continued to decline, and was barely put on shore at Puerto Berrio where he died. Poor Chesterton's reckless spirit rendered him very efficient as a plant-collector."
The mania for orchids was now at its peak and after Chesterton, orchid collectors became less discriminating and tended to strip out the native habitat to prevent rival collectors from finding anything. The region where Chesterton had re-discovered "Miltoniopsis vexillaria" was later said to have been cleared as if by a forest fire. In 1887, the English traveller and orchid collector, Albert Millican, came across Chesterton's grave at Puerto Berrio, which he described in his memoirs as a 
"rough cross of wood on the edge of the forest, on the higher bank of the river, (which) marks the last resting-place of Chesterton, the well-known orchid collector, who did such good service for the firm of James Veitch and Sons, long before the wholesale plunder and extermination of the plants brought about by modern collectors".
Honours.
Amongst the species and varieties of plant named after Chesterton are:

WEEG

WEEG (90.7 FM) was a radio station serving the eastern Long Island area from May 2010 until October 2011. It broadcast on FM frequency 90.7 MHz and is under ownership of the Hamptons Community Radio Corporation. This station was operated under a construction permit with program test authority as their radio station facility was built.
Hamptons Community Radio Corporation had a license to simulcast from Westhampton, New York (89.1 FM) with the assigned call sign WEEW. They also had a license to operate on 90.7 FM in East Hampton however it did not have a tower and was required to get tower access by October 2011 or lose the license for the frequency. It ceased operations at 8 a.m. on October 1, 2011. To operate on the 90.7 frequency it would have shared it with WEGB. The shared time agreement called for WEEG to take about 9 hours every weekday and all of Saturday while WEGB got most of the weekdays plus all of Sunday. Both these stations operated with a directional pattern to protect New York City's WFUV, also operating on 90.7 MHz.
History.
This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on October 21, 2008. This permit was scheduled to expire on October 21, 2011.
The station was assigned the WEER call letters by the FCC on November 3, 2008.
Hamptons Community Radio Corporation was a non-profit 501c3 (IRS designation) entity governed by a five member Board of Directors. It is also registered with the New York State Attorney General's office to accept donations.
In 2007 HCRC applied for three frequencies over which to broadcast: 90.7 in East Hampton, which the FCC approved subject to a time-sharing agreement with Community Bible Church, and 91.7 and/or 89.1 in the Riverhead area. In June 2010 the FCC approved 89.1 (licensed to Westhampton), which must be constructed by 2013. The callsign assigned was WEEW. The 91.7 frequency was granted to another applicant, and HCRC chose not to pursue an appeal of the FCC's decision.
Thus the station had two full-time frequencies (88.7 and 89.1, and a shared-time station 90.7), However, all the stations wee identified as WEER East End Radio, except for the hourly legal IDs. As a "community" station, the entity relies heavily on local volunteers.
The station was conceived at a time when Long Island University was reported to be looking to sell its National Public Radio affiliated station WLIU (now WPPB) in Southampton, New York. That station became locally owned in December 2010 giving the Hamptons at the time two nonprofit radio stations that competed for the same money base.
WEER came on the air over Memorial Day weekend in May 2010. It took over the repeater signal of WPKN paying it $60,000 for the signal and taking over the $4,000/month tower rental. The station's plans to broadcast from studios in Bridgehampton, New York were delayed because dry rot was discovered in its planned facility. It went on the air broadcasting from Southold, New York. It plans to return its studio to the South Fork, Long Island by the end of Summer 2010.
The founder was Barbara Barri, a former announcer for KZLA (now KXOS) in Los Angeles, California. Ms. Barri continued as President, Executive Director, Station Manager, Program & News Director, Music Director, and a member of the Board. Peter Mundo was Sports Director, and also doubles as Director of Marketing.
On June 16, 2011, the station had its call sign changed to "WPKM" then again on June 23, 2011, to "WEEG". The station closed at 8 a.m., October 1, 2011 After the construction permit was allowed to expire, the station was deleted from the FCC's database on October 24, 2011.

He was a justice of the New York Supreme Court from 1907 to 1920, elected on the Republican ticket. In 1913, in a suit for separation brought by Gardner L. Field against his wife Adelaide, Justice Crane held that a household is managed by the wife, not by the mother of the husband, and that a wife is not obliged to live with the husband if a mother-in-law makes the home unpleasant. He dismissed the suit, dealing a "crushing blow to the mother-in-law system." In 1918, he issued a ruling which allowed doctors to prescribe contraception.
In January 1917, he was appointed a judge of the New York Court of Appeals under the Amendment of 1899. In 1920, he was elected to a 14-year term on the Court of Appeals. In 1934, he was elected Chief Judge on the Republican and Democratic tickets. He was the President of the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1938. He retired from the bench at the end of 1939 when he reached the constitutional age limit of 70 years. 
He was buried at the Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.

David Banks (cricketer, born 1961)

David Andrew Banks (born 11 January 1961) is a former English cricketer who played first-class and List A cricket for Worcestershire and Warwickshire. He also played minor counties cricket (and a few List A games) for Staffordshire and for the Worcestershire Cricket Board team.
He made his Worcestershire debut in mid-August 1982 in a John Player League match against Hampshire at Southampton, holding a catch to dismiss Hampshire captain Nick Pocock.
Banks did not bat, owing to a first-wicket partnership of 224 between Alan Ormrod (92*) and Dipak Patel (125) which as of 2008 remained a record opening stand for Worcestershire in List A cricket.
That proved to be his only first-team appearance of the season.
In 1983 Banks hit a century on his first-class debut, though it was to remain the only one he ever made. He scored 100 and 53 against Oxford University in June,
which led to his being given a run in the team during the middle part of the summer, but he was unable to repeat this success and scored only 210 more runs in 11 first-class innings. He fared no better in the one-day game, managing just 35 runs in six innings.
Banks remained at Worcestershire for a couple more years, but scored only two more half-centuries (both in first-class games) and when 1986 came around he was playing in the Minor Counties Championship for Staffordshire. Although more of his matches were minor, the NatWest Trophy afforded him the chance of List A games occasionally. In June 1988 Staffordshire played Surrey at Burton upon Trent, and although they lost the game they put in a creditable performance thanks largely to Banks. He scored 62*, his only List A half-century, and took the wickets of Alec Stewart and Monte Lynch. Banks' all-round performance won him the man-of-the-match award
Banks returned to the first-class game, with Warwickshire, halfway through the 1988 season, and he remained at Edgbaston in 1989 as well. He scored one first-class half-century in each season, but did not produce consistent scores and was relegated to the Second XI by the middle of June 1989. For 1990 he was back with Staffordshire, for whom he continued to play until the mid-nineties. His final List A game was for the recreational Worcestershire Cricket Board against Buckinghamshire in the C&G Trophy in late August 2001.
He had some significant appearances in club cricket. In 1986 he was part of the Stourbridge side which beat Weston-super-Mare to lift the William Younger Cup,
while he later turned out for Old Hill, in 1993 playing as they beat West Bromwich Dartmouth to win the National Club Championship.
As of November 2012, David was appointed club coach of Halesowen Cricket Club with responsibility for overseeing youth cricket development as well as senior sides coaching.

History.
Allen Glover, of Demopolis, gave the property, along with the beginnings of the main house, to his son, Williamson Allen Glover, in the early 1830s. The house was centered on a prominent star-shaped hill. Williamson Allen Glover expanded the house through successive additions and reconfigurations. He went on to raise a total of sixteen children in the mansion's twenty rooms.
Architecture.
The exterior of the house features a Carolina-type monumental two-story Ionic portico, east and west side porches, and a continuous cornice with dentils above the second story and the cupola. The house plan forms a T-shape, to take advantage of the cross-ventilation that this plan affords. The major interior rooms include an entrance hall, twin parlors, great halls on both main floors that are long, a dining room, eight bedrooms, and a roof-top cupola, the largest residential example in Alabama. The cupola houses a music room that measures by , double doors exit the south side of the music room onto a three sided porch with Doric columns. The cupola functioned as a look-out over the plantation and, along with the great halls, as a way to exhaust heated air out of the house during hot weather. Though no longer extant, the grounds once included formal gardens, a carriage house, a two-story servant's quarters, a schoolhouse, several barns, a corn crib, a shop, five slave cabins behind the main house, and a "slave village" about one mile away. Additionally there was a detached kitchen, now destroyed, that was later moved and attached to the house.
The house passed through different families over the years, going through some periods of disrepair and later, restorations. A massive restoration was begun around 2005 and the exterior was completely finished. The mansion has remained empty since and is slowly being overtaken by vegetation.

Latindex

Latindex (Regional Cooperative Online Information System for Scholarly Journals from Latin America, the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal) is a bibliographical information system available for free consultation at [http://www.latindex.org]. Established as a network in 1997, the project is based on the cooperation of 17 national resource centers that operate in a coordinated scheme for the gathering and dissemination of relevant information and data on the Iberoamerican journals.
The aims of Latindex are disseminating, fostering and developing both the scientific and the editorial fields, and to fulfill their information needs in the best possible manner. Latindex was created following the recommendations arose in the First Workshop on Latin American Scientific Publications held in Guadalajara, Mexico in 1994. The idea was adopted by the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1995, and in February 1997, the First Technical Meeting was held in Mexico City with the commitment of four countries (Brazil, Cuba, Venezuela and Mexico). With the incorporation of Spain and Portugal in 1998, Latindex evolved towards an Iberoamerican system.
Products.

Journey of Souls (album)

Journey of Souls is the second album by Norwegian symphonic power metal band Keldian, and was released worldwide in May 2008 by American label Perris Records. It was produced, engineered and mixed by Arild Aardalen and mastered by Mika Jussila at Finnvox Studios.
The album continues the band's science-fiction inspired lyrical themes and the melding of 80s era melodic rock with modern power and symphonic metal. However, the tracks "Reaper" and "God of War" show the band stretching their niche in both more melodic and more metallic directions. The album also features the Iron Maiden-sounding epic "Memento Mori".
The lyrics deal with the troubles and possibilities of souls traveling through space and time, which culminates in the closing number "Dreamcatcher", and the vocal line "In my dreams I can shape the future, a journey of souls to the end..."

Foreign Exchange Regulation Act

The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) was legislation passed by the Indian Parliament in 1973 by the government of Indira Gandhi and came into force with effect from January 1, 1974. FERA imposed stringent regulations on certain kinds of payments, the dealings in foreign exchange and securities and the transactions which had an indirect impact on the foreign exchange and the import and export of currency. The bill was formulated with the aim of regulating payments and foreign exchange.
Coca-Cola was India's leading soft drink until 1977 when it left India after a new government ordered the company to turn over its secret formula for Coca-Cola and dilute its stake in its Indian unit as required by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). In 1993, the company (along with PepsiCo) returned after the introduction of India's Liberalization policy.
FERA was repealed in 1998 by the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and replaced by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, which liberalised foreign exchange controls and restrictions on foreign investment. 
FERA :
FERA was introduced at a time when foreign exchange (Forex) reserves of the country were low, Forex being a scarce commodity. FERA therefore proceeded on the presumption that all foreign exchange earned by Indian residents rightfully belonged to the Government of India and had to be collected and surrendered to the Reserve bank of India (RBI). FERA primarily prohibited all transactions, except one’s permitted by RBI.

World Register of Marine Species

The World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) is a database that hopes to provide an authoritative and comprehensive list of names of marine organisms. 
Overview.
The content of the registry is edited and maintained by scientific specialists on each group of organism. These taxonomists control the quality of the information, which is gathered from malacological journals and several regional and taxon-specific databases. WoRMS maintains valid names of all marine organisms, but also provides information on synonyms and invalid names. It will be an on-going task to maintain the registry, as new species are constantly being discovered and described by scientists. In addition, the nomenclature and taxonomy of existing species is often corrected or changed as new research is constantly being published.
History.
WoRMS was founded in 2008 and grew out of the European Register of Marine Species. It is primarily funded by the European Union and hosted by the Flanders Marine Institute in Ostend, Belgium. WoRMS has established formal agreements with several other biodiversity projects, including the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the Encyclopedia of Life. In 2008, WoRMS stated that it hoped to have an up-to-date record of all marine species completed by 2010, the year in which the Census of Marine Life was completed. 
As of September 2012, WoRMS contained listings for 214,921 valid marine species, of which 196,349 were checked. Their goal is to have a listing for each of the approximately 240,000 marine species.

Paul Binnie

Paul Binnie (born 1967) is a Scottish artist working in the Japanese tradition of woodblock printmaking. His work is reflective of the shin hanga artists of the early to mid-20th century, employing subjects such as landscapes, tattoos, and female beauties (bijin).
Biography.
Paul Binnie was born in Alloa, Scotland in 1967 and studied art history at Edinburgh University and painting and etching at Edinburgh College of Art from 1985 to 1990. After taking his MA in 1990 he moved to Paris until his interest in Japanese Ukiyo-e prints took him to Japan in 1993. There he studied woodblock print carving and printing with the master Seki Kenji.
Binnie also began experimenting with kappazuri (stencil printing). His first stencil prints depicted tattooed figures, followed by actor portraits. By late 1995, Binnie left Seki’s studio to concentrate on his own work, primarily focusing on kabuki subjects, a genre which Binnie had begun to collect in earnest. He was increasingly interested in actor portraits by shin hanga artists such as Natori Shunsen (1886–1960) and Ota Masamitsu (1892–1975), and he also began to appreciate and collect landscape prints by artists such as Kawase Hasui (1883–1957) and Hiroshi Yoshida (1876–1950).
In 1998, Binnie moved to London and set up his own studio. Here he expanded his oeuvre to include landscapes and bijin. While his actor prints were largely concerned with capturing the emotion and intensity of the actor’s role in a given moment, Binnie's landscape and bijin prints often incorporate an art historical reference, usually to earlier well-known prints.
Beginning in 2004, Binnie returned to the tattooed figure subject with the series, "A Hundred Shades of Ink of Edo", in which he applies designs from ukiyo-e prints by famous artists to nude figures.

County Road 17 (Elkhart County, Indiana)

Elkhart County Road 17 (CR 17) is a north–south artery in Elkhart County, Indiana. It is currently undergoing improvements to become a four lane divided road with non-limited traffic. Elkhart County Road 17 starts at the state line, connecting with state highway M-217 in Michigan. The roadway crosses into Indiana and becomes Elkhart County Road 17. Currently the improved section of CR 17 ends between CR 40 and CR 38 (CR 17 continues south in its original configuration, as part of Elkhart County's grid-numbered county road system, becoming North County Road 200 West at the Kosciusko County border). The portion of CR 17 between U.S. Route 20 and the Indiana Toll Road (Interstate 80/90) is part of the National Highway System, the only county highway in Indiana on the system.
Route description.
CR 17 southern terminus is at the Kosciusko-Elkhart County Line. From the southern terminus CR 17 heads due north, north of the southern terminus is US 6. Then north of US 6, CR 17 meets CR 40. North of CR 40, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway and curves northwest before CR 38. At CR 38, the route has a traffic light followed by a traffic light at State Road 119 (SR 119). North of SR 119, the route curves due north and becomes limited accesses passing over CR 32 and CR 30. The highway has a traffic light at CR 28, CR 28 links CR 17 and US 33. After CR 28 is a traffic light with Rieth Boulevard, which also provides access to US 33. North of CR 28, the route passes over US 33 and the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks. After the bridge is a traffic light with an access road to CR 45, followed by a bridge over CR 45 and the Elkhart River. After the river the road passes under CR 26. East of Elkhart CR 17 has an interchange with U.S. Route 20 and an intersection with State Road 120. Then in northeast Elkhart CR 17 has an interchange with I-80/I-90/Indiana Toll Road. The portion of CR 17 north of the Indiana Toll Road, along with M-217, is known as the Michiana Parkway. The northern terminus is north of the Indiana Toll Road at the Michigan State Line.
History.
The planning for CR 17 goes back to the 1960s when the state of Indiana panned a bypass of US 33 around the southwest side Goshen, this project was never built. Then in the 1980s a plan to connect the Indiana Toll Road with east side of Elkhart was planned. The project involved replacing some of Elkhart County Road 6. When the project on CR 6 was completed, a need for a north-south corridor in Elkhart County became a problem. Elkhart County choose Elkhart County Road 17 as the north-south corridor. The first section open in the 1990s near the Michigan state line. The section near US 33 open in 2005, with section in between being complete in sections. In October 2012, the new four-lane divided highway opened to traffic from just north of CR 40 to CR 28. The old two-lane highway between CR 38 and CR 18 is now know as Old CR 17.
Future.
The plans are to continue the upgrade of CR 17 south to U.S. Route 6.

Tanglewood Island

Tanglewood Island is a small island in Hale Passage off the northern shore of Fox Island in Pierce County, Washington.
The island was a summer home of Conrad L. Hoska (1856–1910), a prominent figure in the nearby city of Tacoma. From 1945 it hosted a boys' camp, and in the following year the lighthouse structure ("pictured") was completed.
The Geographic Names Information System lists several alternative names: Ellens Isle, Grant Island, Grave Island, and Hoska Island. The name Tanglewood was inspired by the heavy undergrowth and Nathaniel Hawthorne's "Tanglewood Tales". It was chosen as the official name of the island by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names in 1947.
In the 2010 United States Census, the island was included as part of the Fox Island census-designated place. The census block encompassing just Tanglewood Island showed a population of 8 with 5 housing units.

Packet boat

Packet boats were small boats designed for domestic mail, passenger and freight transportation in Europe and its colonies, including North American rivers and canals. They were extensively used for much of the 18th century and in the 19th century, and featured regularly scheduled service.
When ships were put into such service in the 18th century across the Atlantic Ocean between Great Britain and the colonies, services were called the packet trade.
History.
Packet craft were used extensively in European coastal mail services since the 17th century, and gradually added cramped passenger accommodation. As early as 1629, the Dutch East India Company was carrying some passengers on the ill-fated "Batavia" from Texel in Holland to Java. Later, scheduled services were offered, but the time journeys took depended much on the weather. They are even found to be a subject of Daniel Defoe's 1724 novel "". In England the King maintained a weekly packet service with the continent and Ireland using 15 packet vessels. Their importance was evident in the Rose Hill Packet becoming the first craft built in the colony of New South Wales in 1789. In North America, when the Erie Canal opened in New York state in 1825 along the Mohawk River, demand quickly rose for travelers to be accommodated.
Over the two centuries of the sailing packet craft development, they came in various rig configurations which included: schooners, schooners-brigs, sloops, cutters, brigs, brigantines, luggers, feluccas, galleys, xebecs, barques and their ultimate development in the clipper ships. Earlier they were also known as dispatch boats, but the service was also provided by privateers during time of war, and on occasion chartered private yachts. News of "record passages" was eagerly awaited by the public, and the craft's captain and crew were often celebrated in the press. Behind this search for sailing faster than the wind however lay the foundations for a development in naval architecture and its science which would serve until the appearance of the steam vessels.
The American canal packet boats were typically narrow (about 14 feet) to accommodate canals, but might be 70–90 feet long. In the cabin space they could carry up to 60 passengers. Unlike sailing European and American that sought to attain greater speed under sail, the canal packet boats were drawn through the Erie Canal by teams of two or three horses or mules. Compared to overland travel, the boats cut journey time in half and were much more comfortable. Travelers could get from New York City to Buffalo in ten days, with a combination of sailing and packet boats. Some passengers took the boats to see both the Erie Canal and the natural landscapes. Significantly, thousands of others used packet boats to emigrate to Ohio and other parts of the Midwest. These boats were also instrumental in the settling of and travel within Upstate New York through the branch canals such as the Chenango Canal.
Packet boats were also popular along the James River and Kanawha Canal in Virginia, allowing travel beyond the falls upriver.
In 1863, during the Civil War, the packet boat "Marshall" carried the body of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson from Lynchburg to his home in Lexington, Virginia for burial.

Psammoactinia antarctica

Psammoactinia antarctica was an encrusting, colonial cnidarian in the family Hydractiniidae that lived in the Cretaceous Antarctic. Within its family, "P. antarctica" had the unusual ability to agglutinate sand and silt grants, incorporating them into the basal layer and pillars making up the wall of the chambers of its laminae. It encrusted gastropod shells inhabited by hermit crabs of the genus "Paguristes". 
The "Psammoactinia" colony began with a larva landing on a small gastropod shell. The colony then grew past the aperture of the shell and formed a tube that conformed to the hermit crab’s shape and growing pattern.

It Don't Bother Me (album)

"It Don't Bother Me" is the second album by Scottish folk musician Bert Jansch, released in December 1965. The album was produced by Nathan Joseph and Bill Leader, although Leader was left uncredited.
The album features nine songs composed by Jansch, one by Alex Campbell (“So Long (Been on the Road So Long)”), and the traditional “900 Miles”. For this last Jansch accompanies himself on the banjo rather than the steel-string acoustic guitar which he uses elsewhere. "A Man I'd Rather Be" features lead vocals by Roy Harper. “My Lover” also has Harper playing some additional guitar, while John Renbourn is playing the lead acoustic guitar part. “Lucky Thirteen” is a guitar duet with Renbourn, based on a song written by the latter and apparently recorded during the "Bert And John" session. Finally, “Tinkers Blues” and “The Wheel” are guitar instrumentals composed and performed by Jansch.

Latin American Bibliography

The Latin American Bibliography refers to the set of databases and information services on academic journals from Latin America and the Caribbean created by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in the decade of the seventies.
Nowadays, the Latin-American Bibliography is composed by the following databases: CLASE ("Latin-American Citations in Social Sciences and Humanities"); PERIODICA ("Index of Latin-American Journals in Science"); Latindex ("Regional Co-operative Information System for Scholarly Journals from Latin America, the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal").
These databases were created by a group of information professionals, who identified the need to register, preserve and give access to the Latin-American knowledge published in the main academic journals of the region. Within UNAM, the fostering institution of these information products was the Science and Humanities Information Center (CICH) created in 1971.
For the size of its collection of Latin-American journals, for the quantity of compiled records and for the duration and consistency of the project, the Latin-American Bibliography produced in the UNAM constitutes one of the most valuable resources for scholars and experts specializing in Latin-American affairs.
Products.
Three databases are available through the web site of UNAM’s General Directorate for Libraries General Directorate for Libraries:
CLASE ("Latin-American Citations in Social Sciences and Humanities"). Bibliographical database, with more than 280,000 records, of which nearly 14,000 provide abstracts and links to the full text of the documents. It includes more than 1,400 journals specializing in Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, from more than 20 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Documents not available in full text can be retrieved through the Document Supply Service of the Latin-American Serials Collection (Hemeroteca Latinoamericana) of the DGB. Direct link: CLASE website
PERIODICA (Index of Latin-American Journals in Science). Bibliographical database with more than 315,000 records, of which near 60,000 provide abstracts and links to the full text of the documents. The database indexes more than 1,500 journals specializing in Science and Technology, from more than 20 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Documents not available in full text can be retrieved through the Document Supply Service of the Latin-American Serials Collection (Hemeroteca Latinoamericana) of the DGB. Direct link: PERIODICA website
Latindex (Regional Co-operative Information System for Scholarly Journals from Latin America, the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal). This initiative provides relevant information and data of the scholarly journals edited in the Iberoamerican region. Three databases are produced through the collaborative work of the member institutions: Directory,: with more than 17,000 records; Catalogue, with more than 3,500 selected journals that fulfill international quality criteria and an Index of Electronic Journals, offering nearly 3,000 links to available resources in full text. Direct link: Latindex website
Currently, the Department of Latin-American Bibliography contributes to the production of two other Latin-American information products:
ASFA ("Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts"). Bibliographical international database on Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries, covering subject areas such as technology and administration of the marine environments and its resources (salt and sweet waters), including its socioeconomic and juridical aspects. It offers abstracts of articles published in approximately 7,000 periodic publications, besides thesis, monographs and other not conventional literature. The contribution relative to the Mexican journals is produced in the Department of Latin-American Bibliography from 1981. Link: ASFA website
SciELO Mexico ("Scientific Electronic Library Online"). Open access electronic journals collection that includes a selection of the most recognized academic publications of the country in all areas of knowledge, previously selected accordingly to the most accepted criteria related to content and editorial standards. Currently it offers the full text of more than 2,500 articles from 28 academic Mexican journals. Direct link: Scielo México website
Over the time, other databases were produced by the Department of Latin-American Bibliography during its more than 30 years of existence, namely:
BLAT ("Latin-American Bibliography I and II"), with information compiled from international sources, mainly documents from Latin-American origin (produced by Latin American authors and institutions) or those in which their object of study was related to the region. The database ceased in 1997. Another one was MEXINV, as a subset of CLASE, offered bibliographical records of documents relative only to Mexico. This database ceased in the decade of the nineties.
Institution.
Currently, the databases described above are produced by the Department of Latin-American Bibliography, part of the Assistant Office for Information Services of the General Directorate for Libraries (DGB) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The original databases (BLAT, CLASE, PERIODICA, MEXINV and Latindex) were created by the Science and Humanities Information Center (CICH). Since the incorporation of the CICH to UNAM’s General Directorate for Libraries in 1997, this institution acts as Responsible Editor.

A Pizza Tweety Pie

A Pizza Tweety-Pie is a 1958 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes animated cartoon. Written by Warren Foster and directed by Friz Freleng, it features Tweety, Sylvester and Granny, with Mel Blanc providing the voices of Sylvester (speaking in an Italian accent) and Tweety, and June Foray (uncredited) providing Granny's voice.
Synopsis.
Tweety and Granny arrive at their hotel in Venice, Italy. From his cage on the balcony, Tweety looks down at the canal and thinks it is a flooded street and that there must be a lot of barber shops down there (because of the many red and white striped barber poles).
As Tweety is singing “Santa Lucia” and strumming his mandolin in his cage, Sylvester spies him from his balcony across the canal. In haste, he runs out of the hotel with an open sandwich roll, and falls into the water. He climbs out and finds a canoe and starts rowing, but forgets to loosen it from the rope. After he cuts the rope, he sinks with the canoe.
Sylvester then starts paddling in a rubber raft, but Tweety takes a slingshot and punctures it. The raft floats back to the dock with Sylvester as the air leaks out, and Sylvester removes the deflated raft from his hind quarters in disgust.
Next, Sylvester tries to swing across the canal with a rope Tarzan-style, but lands in the water into the gaping mouth of a hungry shark. Sylvester wrestles his way out and swims hurriedly away.
Then, using an electric fan and a balloon tied to his waist, Sylvester attempts to float his way across through the air, but he floats too high. Tweety, again using the slingshot, shoots Sylvester down from the sky. Sylvester dons a bathing cap as he is descending, but misses the water, landing on the sidewalk, next to Tweety and Granny’s hotel as it turns out. He runs into the hotel and takes the elevator up to the floor of Granny and Tweety's room, but Granny and Tweety are leaving, so Sylvester goes back down the elevator, which takes him...into the water!
As Tweety and Granny are taking a relaxing gondola ride along the canal, Sylvester is awaiting them on a bridge with a fishing rod. Sylvester hooks a passing speedboat, forcibly yanking him into the water. After a close call with a striped pole, Sylvester gets slammed into a low bridge, where there is a warning sign that reads, “"Ducka your head, lowla bridgeada"”!
Finally, as Sylvester is dining on a plate of spaghetti, he again hears Tweety singing “Santa Lucia” (he is out of his cage this time), and proceeds to hurl a strand of spaghetti like a lasso to catch Tweety. Nearly strangled, Tweety screams to Granny for help. Granny clutches Sylvester's noose of pasta and substitutes a mallet in Tweety’s place. As Sylvester sucks the spaghetti into his mouth, he gets clobbered squarely in the head with the mallet, causing birds to appear uttering Tweety’s trademark line: “I tawt I taw a puddytat!” (Ironically in this cartoon, Tweety never uses this line himself.)

Juan H. Cintrón García

Juan Herminio Cintrón García (11 March 1919 – 22 September 2012) was a Puerto Rican politician and Mayor of Ponce, Puerto Rico from 1968 to 1972.

Early years.
Cintron García was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico in 1919. He was the second child of Arturo Cintrón Gonzalez, a businessman, and Herminia Garcia Mercado, a school teacher. He attended elementary and middle school in Ponce public schools and graduated from Ponce High School in 1936. After performing in the business of his father for several years, earned his bachelor's degree in business administration from Universidad Catolica de Puerto Rico in 1971. He was concurrently acting as mayor of Ponce while he did his college work.
Career.
Cintron served as mayor Ponce from 1969 to 1973. During his administration the city built the Juan Pachín Vicéns Auditorium, moved the Ponce Municipal Library to a new facility next to Teatro La Perla, re-organized the Archivo Histórico de Ponce, enlarged the Avenida Las Américas roadway, and opened the Centro Gubernamental de Ponce at Avenida Las Americas and Avenida Hostos. Under his administration the Francisco Montaner Stadium was also remodeled. 
Two other projects inaugurated during his administration were the new Puerto Rico Police regional headquarters on Avenida Hostos and the start of the construction of the University of Puerto Rico at Ponce on Ponce Bypass and PR-12. In addition to commencing construction of the University of Puerto Rico at Ponce, for which the Ponce Municipal Government provided $250,000, Cintron Garcia also rebuilt the aging Hospital Municipal Tricoche. 
After his mayoral service, Cintron Garcia served as Puerto Rico's Secretary of Commerce from 1977 to 1984 under Governor Carlos Romero Barceló. From 1992 to 1997 he served as municipal assemblyman in Ponce.

Family and Children's Services of Central Maryland

Family and Children's Services of Central Maryland (FCS) is a private, nonsectarian social services agency that was founded in 1849. FCS addresses issues from birth through the end of life with a goal of helping each individual reach his or her highest potential. FCS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
Services.
FCS offers counseling, case management, training, and recruitment of foster families and community volunteers for vulnerable populations, including:
Some services are offered without charge; others are offered on a sliding-fee scaled based on income. Participation in some programs is court-ordered.
In fiscal year 2008, FCS served 8,000 families and individuals in Central Maryland.
Locations.
FCS operates domestic violence programs in Baltimore and Carroll counties, and adult day centers in Carroll and Harford counties. Some specialized programs, such as the After School AKAdemy, Children's Permanency Program, Supervised Visitation and Exchange Program and Family Support Center, are only available in one location or area.
Accreditation and recognition.
Family and Children's Services of Central Maryland is accredited by the Council on Accreditation (COA), an independent, international accrediting body for child and family service and behavioral healthcare organizations. COA accredits both private organizations and government agencies. FCS is one of nine private social services organizations in Central Maryland to have earned this accreditation.
In 2004 and 2005, the United Way honored FCS for its development of outcome models to measure the impact of its programs.
The Coalition of Geriatric Services (COGS) in Howard County, Maryland, awarded Family and Children’s Services the Community Partnership Award in 2004. In Baltimore City, the Commission on Aging and Retirement Education presented the Barbara Mikulski Caregiver Award to FCS in 2005.
In 2008, the Family Caregiver Alliance issued the Rosalinde Gilbert Innovations in Alzheimer’s Disease Caregiver Legacy Award to the FCS Carroll County Adult Day Center for its Montessori-based exercise program for clients with mild to moderate dementia.
History.
The organization now known as Family and Children's Services of Central Maryland is the result of a combination of predecessor agencies dating back to 1849.
The records from FCS predecessor agencies can be found in the Special Collections section of The Milton S. Eisenhower Library, The Johns Hopkins University (Ms. 360). Much of the content below is taken, with permission, from the archives.
Charity organizations began developing at a time when a major demographic shift was occurring in American society. As industrialization began to replace an agrarian economy, many citizens left their rural communities only to find themselves unprepared to deal with urban life. Later events in the nation's history, including wars and the Depression, also caused similar de-stabilization in the society. Effects of society in transition are most affecting to those without adequate economic resources. Poverty, illness, addictions, and desertions left families bereft of shelter, food, and fuel.
FCS is one of only nine social services organizations in Central Maryland to have earned accreditation by the Council on Accreditation (COA), an independent, international accrediting body for child and family service and behavioral healthcare organizations.
Early reformers saw a correlation between morality and the economic condition, but as the work with clients advanced, these assumptions were challenged. As the theory and practice of social work evolved, new approaches were used to solve the problems of welfare.
In the mid-nineteenth century, Baltimore Mayor Elijah Stansbury called for delegates from each of the city's wards to meet and plan for an efficient relief administration. The result was the formation of the Association for the Improvement of the Condition of the Poor (AICP) in 1849. The AICP was the third organization of its kind in the United States (after New York City and Brooklyn, NY).
In 1881, Daniel Coit Gilman, president of The Johns Hopkins University, helped to found the Charity Organization Society (COS) modeled on a similar agency in Boston. Its purpose was not to give relief per se but to combine and develop all the charitable resources in the community into a single agency. Service to the client might include a referral to another agency, church, or individual, and it usually included the concept of "friendly visiting" to give personal service in a client's home "to promote health, thrift, and to build up character." Among the COS members were Amos Griswald Warner, Mary E. Richmond, Mary Willcox (Brown) Glenn, John M. Glenn, and Dr. Jeffrey R. Brackett, and each one became known nationally for contributions to the development and practice of social work.
Other agencies founded during this period provided specialized services for particular groups: children, women, the African American population. After several decades it was recognized that combined resources and an allocation of public funds were necessary. This began a series of mergers.
The AICP and the COS were instrumental in bringing about legislation creating the Juvenile Court, compulsory school attendance laws, non-support laws, child labor laws, and licensing for boarding infants. The two agencies were formally incorporated as the Federated Charities (FC) in 1910. In 1911, the Legal Aid Bureau was organized as a department of the FC and remained so until it was separated as a single agency in 1929. During this period (ca 1900-1920), charity funding also became specialized and was administered by a single agency, the Baltimore Alliance (succeeded by the Community Chest in 1926).
In 1919, Federated Charities voted to change the name to Family Welfare Association. The primary goals of FC would be service to the family, including "securing medical treatment, finding employment, searching for missing husbands, straightening out domestic difficulties, instruction in household economics, and strengthening connections with church and relatives." Persons prominent in the Association during this period include Gaylord Lee Clark, Anna D. Ward, Doris Slothower, and Dorothy Pope.
Rehabilitative services were put aside during the early years of the Depression as the Agency struggled to aid families and at the same time to get the City and State to assume some responsibility. Gaylord Lee Clark, president of FWA in 1929, called upon the Governor to appoint a Commission to investigate the social welfare needs of the State. Along with the implementation of federal programs, this led to the present Maryland State Department of Welfare. When the Baltimore Emergency Relief Commission was set up in 1933 with a pipeline to federal funds, the FWA moved to resume its function, "the promotion of adequate family life through casework service."
Social work as a profession was advanced in the 1930s. Caseworkers began exploring new ideas regarding the psychology of human behavior, and community psychiatric services were tried.
In 1940, the Community Fund recommended a merger of four agencies. The Henry Watson Children's Aid Society and the FWA merged in 1942 (Annual Report, 1942). Briefly known as the Family Welfare and Henry Watson Children's Aid Society of Baltimore, the name more popularly was known as the Family and Children's Society. Final mergers joined the Society for the Protection of Children from Cruelty and Immorality and the Shelter for Aged and Infirm Colored Persons in 1943.
The Family and Children's Society emerged in 1943 as a multi-service agency. The Society's service to families was expanded to include medical, foster care, housekeeping, marriage counseling, adoptions, home finding, group counseling, and community mental health.
In 1985, the Family and Children's Society merged with the Maryland Children's and Family Services and is now known as the Family and Children's Services of Central Maryland. In 1998, the Family Life Center, in Howard County, merged with FCS.

The Gulf Coast Conference (GCC) was a short-lived NCAA college athletic conference composed of universities in the U.S. state of Texas from 1949 until 1957. The charter members of the conference were University of Houston, Midwestern University (now Midwestern State University), North Texas State College (now the University of North Texas), and Trinity University. The Gulf Coast Conference spawned from then members of the Lone Star Conference, and its president was D.L. Ligon. In 1956, when the NCAA created divisions, all members of the conference at the time were classified as part of the NCAA's College Division, which was later subdivided into Division II and Division III in 1973. Charter member Houston had already left for the Missouri Valley Conference by the end of 1950, and was classified as a University Division school, which later became known as Division I.

Hélène Kuragin

Elena "Hélène" Vasilyevna Kuragina is a fictional character in Leo Tolstoy's novel War and Peace and its various cinematic adaptations.
Biography.
Hélène is Pierre Bezukhov's socially ambitious and sexually alluring wife, who uses her sexual attractions to earn social power in high-society circles but eventually defeats herself and dies (it is implied in the book that she dies from drug overdose in an attempted abortion). Before her marriage to Pierre, which she undertakes purely for social and financial advantage, it is rumoured that Hélène has had an incestuous affair with her profligate brother, Anatole. After her marriage, Hélène has an affair with Dolokhov, whom Pierre fights in a duel. In a feat of luck, Pierre wounds Dolokhov but sinks into a depression, further abandoning his wife. Hélène quickly becomes a prominent and respected member of Petersburg's society. Despite her stupidity, Hélène is considered very cultured and intelligent. She frequently hosts dinner parties for high society friends and her salon becomes extremely popular. Towards the end of the novel, Hélène forsakes her former religion and adopts Catholicism. She makes a large donation to the church hoping for the Pope to annul her marriage to Pierre so she can marry a young foreign prince. Soon after, Hélène falls ill due to a pregnancy and dies.

Herringbone describes a distinctive V-shaped weaving pattern usually found in twill fabric. It is distinguished from a plain chevron by the break at reversal, which makes it resemble a broken zigzag. The pattern is called herringbone because it resembles the skeleton of a herring fish. Herringbone-patterned fabric is usually wool, and is one of the most popular cloths used for suits and outerwear. Tweed cloth is often woven with a herringbone pattern.

Newbridge RFC (Ireland)

Newbridge RFC is an Irish rugby club based in County Kildare. They gained promotion to Division One of the Leinster League for 2008/2009 by winning Division Two in the 2007/2008 season.
History.
The club was founded in 1996 after the amalgamation of the Curragh and Old Kilcullen clubs.
Close to the end of the 1995/1996 season, it seemed clear that the future of rugby in County Kildare was under threat. Despite them having very successful youth teams, both the Curragh and Old Kilcullen clubs were struggling a great deal because of those players moving away. 
In May 1995, there were talks of a possible merger between them, but had fizzled out by August of that year. They eventually resumed with their plans in November, with both clubs being represented by four executive members each; Curragh by Harry Quirke (President), Don O'Keeffe (Chairman), Con McNamara (a member of the original merger team) and Sean Hayes (a new member of the merger team) and Old Kilcullen by Ollie Delaney (President), Niall Kidd (Chairman), Rory O'Carroll (Secretary) and Kieran Murphy (Treasurer).
Back in the 1995/1996 season they had set themselves a five-year vision: 
" To actively support the development of rugby in the area measured by : 
Playing - To be competing for AIL Status
Commercial - To have a club which is financially secure and capable of supporting growth".

<doc id="20379129" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20379129" title="Quasi-tort">
Quasi-tort

Quasi-tort is a legal term that is sometimes used to describe unusual tort actions, on the basis of a legal doctrine that some legal duty exists which cannot be classified strictly as negligence in a personal duty resulting in a tort nor as a contractual duty resulting in a breach of contract, but rather some other kind of duty recognizable by the law. It has been used, for example, to describe a tort for strict liability arising out of product liability, although this is typically simply called a 'tort'.
Although it is not to be found in most legal dictionaries, it has been used by some scholars such as Sri Lankan Lakshman Marasinghe. Lakshman proposes that the doctrine provides legal relief that falls outside tort or contract, but with some of the characteristics of tort or contract, as can be found in restitution (including unjust enrichment), equity (including unconscionable conduct), beneficiaries under a trust of the benefit of a promise, people protected by the valid assignment of promise, fiduciary duty, and contracts of insurance.
As a third type of civil wrong.
In "Tort Theory", Lakshman Marasinghe posits that "quasi-delict", a doctrine in civil law jurisdictions, exists as well in common law. Marasinghe thus argues against Viscount Haldane's "dictum" in "Sinclair v Brougham", that the only common law civil causes of action are, by definition, contract and tort.
Brooklyn Law School's law review had an article with a similar argument, "Contractor Duty to Third Parties Not in Privity: A Quasi-Tort Solution to the Vexing Problem of Victims of Nonfeasance."
Malta recognizes quasi-tort as a third type of liability. Belgium also has quasi-tort.
As a violation of a statutory or regulatory scheme.
Tort law has been modified by statute to expand protection, and limit liability. Many tort law statutes have their origins in common law, and are interpreted through common law. These include worker's compensation, insurance law, consumer protection laws, labor law, products liability law, energy law, compensation to relatives on death, anti-discrimination law, and other miscellaneous and difficult-to-categorize areas of law. This may include statutory law or administrative regulation that define, aid interpretation (construction), provide means to calculate quantum of damages, clarify personal responsility, or replace torts with their origins in common law.
As a miscellaneous type of wrong-doing.
Lakshman suggests there may be scholars who have viewed certain recently created torts, such as negligent infliction of emotional distress, as quasi-torts.
Raymond T. Nimmer used the term in:- "Restatement (Second) of Torts section 552 on negligent misrepresentation ... deals with a quasi-tort, quasi-contract form of liability."
Lakshman Marasinghe posits that it is a category where the wrong is "both" a contract "and" a tort, such as with legal malpractice, or medical malpractice. For example, New York law applies the same statute of limitations "for medical, dental or podiatric malpractice to be commenced within two years and six months," whether under contract or tort theories.
Some equity actions can be viewed as quasi-torts, such as Quiet title and Qui tam actions.

Old Brevard County Courthouse

The Old Brevard County Courthouse, renamed in 2006 as the Vassar B. Carlton Historic Titusville Courthouse, is an historic courthouse building located at 506 South Palm Avenue in Titusville, Florida. Designed in the Classical Revival style, it was built in 1912 by Lightman, McDonald and Company to serve as Brevard County's first courthouse building erected in Titusville.
Because of its long, narrow shape, Brevard County has centralized its governmental services in Viera, with a North Branch in Titusville and a South Branch in Melbourne. Titusville, however, still remains the official county seat. Today the Old Brevard County Courthouse is still used for some functions, but is an annex of the "North Brevard Government Center" located at 400 South Street in Titusville.
In 1989, the Old Brevard County Courthouse was listed in "A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture", published by the University of Florida Press. It was renamed in February 2006 in honor of the late Vassar B. Carlton (1913-2005), who served as a County Judge and then as a Circuit Judge in Brevard County from 1941 until his election to the Florida Supreme Court in 1968.

When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd (Hindemith)

"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd: A Requiem for those we love" is a 1946 composition by composer Paul Hindemith, based on the poem of the same name by Walt Whitman. Conductor Robert Shaw and the Robert Shaw Chorale commissioned the work after the 1945 death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It premiered on April 20, 1946, conducted by Shaw.
David Neumeyer and others regard the "Lilacs" Requiem as Hindemith's "only profoundly American work." Paul Hume said, "I doubt if we shall ever mourn Abraham Lincoln's untimely death more eloquently than in the words of Walt Whitman set to the music of Paul Hindemith; it is a work of genius and the presence of the genius presiding over its performance brought us splendor and profound and moving glory."
The work is scored for mezzo-soprano and baritone soloists, SATB chorus, and full orchestra. After an unnumbered orchestral Introduction, the text of the poem is divided into 11 movements:
The work is scored for mezzo-soprano and baritone soloists, mixed choir, and an orchestra of 2 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (one doubling cor anglais), clarinet, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons (one doubling contrabassoon), 3 horns, 2 trumpets, off-stage bugle, 2 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, glockenspiel, chimes, tam-tam, triangle, snare drum, bass drum, field drum, organ, and strings (First & second violins, violas, cellos, and double basses).

Pennsylvania Route 823

Pennsylvania Route 823 (formerly designated by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways as SR 0823) was a short-lived state highway in the western Pennsylvania county of McKean. State Route 823 went northward from the community of Big Shanty along Big Shanty Road and Laffayette Avenue for , terminating at an intersection with U.S. Route 219 in nearby Lewis Run. The route was commissioned by the Department of Highways (now Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) in 1929 and was decommissioned in 1932.
Route description.
State Route 823 began at the community of Big Shanty. The route went northward then turned to the southeast just north of Big Shanty. The route intersected with Toothman Road, a dead-end highway, beyond which it became known as "Big Shanty Road", named after the nearby borough. State Route 823 then curved to the northeast, making a gradual, smooth turn to the north. The route then intersected with Lineman Road, another nearby dead-end highway. From here, a set of railroad tracks parallelled nearby, following SR 823 for most of its length. After that, there was an intersection with Droney Road, which headed out to the paralleling railroad tracks. 
Just north of Droney Road, State Route 823 continued northward into the limits of the borough of Lewis Run. The highway then headed to the northwest, changing its name to "Laffayette Avenue". After crossing into Lewis Run, there was an intersection with an unnamed loop road and with Valley Hunt Road, a dead-end highway. The route then turned to the northeast, intersecting with a few more local roads, and terminated at an intersection with U.S. Route 219 in the northern borough limits of Lewis Run.
History.
State Route 823 was designated as a state route in 1929, a year after the mass commissioning of state traffic routes in Pennsylvania. However, unlike most 800s and 900s highway designations, SR 823 did not have a parent highway. Instead, it was just a spur off U.S. Route 219 (former SR 10). The state route designation, however, did not last long, being decommissioned just three years after its assignment in 1932. The route is now designated and signed by PennDOT as McKean County State Route 4001, which extended the state designation from Big Shanty down to nearby Pennsylvania Route 59.

The Winter Park Advocate

The Winter Park Advocate was a black newspaper in Winter Park, Florida. It was founded by Gus C. Henderson and published its first issue on May 31, 1889.
History.
The "Advocate" was first published on May 31, 1889. It was one of only two black-owned newspapers in the state of Florida. It was also the only newspaper in Winter Park, and thus served both black and white readers. Henderson was the publisher, reporter, editor, salesman, and typesetter for the paper. On the first day of the "Advocate"’s publication, there was a large Emancipation Day celebration. For the celebration, the Orlando and Winter Park Railroad ran special trains and almost 800 people were in attendance for the event. The paper's offices were located in Hannibal Square, the heart of Winter Park's segregated black community. The "Advocate" sold for $1.25 for a year's subscription, and published for two years until Henderson moved to Orlando.
G.C. Henderson.
Henderson was born on November 16, 1862, in Columbia County, near Lake City. Before moving to Winter Park, Henderson was Florida’s first black traveling salesman. When that job did not work out, he moved to Winter Park. Shortly thereafter, Henderson started The Advocate. In his editorials, Henderson often focused on writing about education and voting rights for his fellow African Americans. He later started two other papers; the "Christian Recorder" and the "Florida Record". Henderson died in 1915, at the age of 53.

Albert Teveodjré

Albert Teveodjré (born 1928 or 1929) is a Beninese writer and politician. He was Information Minister of Dahomey (now Benin) from 1960 to 1963.
Early life.
Teveodjré was educated at Toulouse, Fribourg, and Geneva. He taught at secondary schools at Cahors, Dakar, and Porto Novo before travelling to Paris to pursue a writing career. While in Paris he wrote "L'Afrique révoltée" in 1958 and "Afrique debout" in 1959. He also served as editor in chief of the left-wing newsper "L'Etudiant Noir". During this time he frequented left-wing circles to discuss political affairs. At these and various cultural conferences across Europe and Asia, he learned to speak German, English, and Spanish, besides his native French.
Before independence was obtained from France, Teveodjré helped found the proindependence organization Mouvement Africain de Libération Nationale and the Ligue pour la Promotion Africaine, as well as leading the Syndicat National des Ensignants du Dahomey. In February 1960, Teveodjré participated in a strike at the Technical College of Cotonou. The demonstrators requested to fire two professors who failed several students and had them expelled.
Political career.
In October 1960, Teveodjré applied for a government position. He received the job of administrative secretary of the Dahomeyan Unity Party (P.D.U). His first job was to announce that a group of people were to inform the uneducated about news from the government perspective. Those who were literate could read three government-sponsored newspapers: "L'Aube Nouvelle", "La Nation", and "La Depeche du Dahomey". Teveodjré had previously written columns for one of these, "L'Aube Nouvelle".
President Maga named the new ministers in his government on December 30, and chose many leaders from the former R.D.D. and P.N.D. He also chose several relative newcomers, like Bertin Borna under the Labor and Civil Service and Teveodjré, the new Information Minister. At this position he began suspending the publication of Justin Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin's opposition newspaper, "Dahomey-Matin", and its predecessor, "Cotonou-Matin", in April 1961. This was in accordance with a law limiting the freedom of speech passed in February of that year.
On May 26 Teveodjré notified Maga that Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin had plotted to assassinate the president but he and 11 other dissidents had been arrested. The trial date was set for December. It differed from many political trials in Africa being that it was held in public and the defence was allowed a lawyer from Paris. In any event, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin received five years for his role in the conspiracy, and the others were dealt from one- to ten-year sentences. Maga ultimately released them in November 1962, saying in a broadcast that it was not only due to their good behavior in jail but also to reconcile with his former enemies.
Teveodjré convinced the Dahomeyan government to create an Agence Dahomennée de Presse to be led by him, and before the year was over he had access to the Agence France-Presse's wire services and a monopoly in Dahomeyan journalism. Another project of his was the construction of a museum to encompass all of Dahomey's art pieces. In July 1961, he was granted a 30-kilowatt transmitter, seven times more powerful than that owned by Radio Dahomey, by the Division of Information of the Company of Broadcasting of France of Overseas (SORAFOM). The Information Minister was named secretary-general of the Union Africaine et Malgache in November 1961.
In the summer of 1963, Dahomey underwent much unrest over the death of deputy Daniel Dessou. On October 28 Chief of Staff of the 800-man Dahomeyan Army Christophe Soglo took control of the country to prevent a civil war. He dismissed the cabinet, dissolved the Assembly, suspended the constitution and banned any type of demonstrations. No longer a member of Beninese politics, in 1964 Teveodjré was appointed to work at the International Affairs Center at Harvard University.
In 1991, he was a presidential candidate and placed third with over 14% of the vote.

<doc id="20379306" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20379306" title="Neighbourhood effect">
Neighbourhood effect

The neighbourhood effect is one of the contextual variables that explains the tendency of a person to vote in a certain direction based upon the relational effects of the people living in the neighbourhood. The voting preference of a neighbourhood tends to be formed by consensus, where people tend to vote with the general trend of the neighbourhood. This consensus is formed by the personal connections a person forms in a community. There also seems to be some socio-economic correlation to voting patterns, and this has also been used to predict voting behavior.
History.
The term was coined in the seminal works of Kevin Cox in 'The Voting Decision in a Spatial Context' and later popularized by Ron J. Johnston in 'Political Geography' (1979) and Peter J. Taylor and G. Gudgin in 'Geography of Elections' (1979) It seems, at the time at least, that they were attempting to justify the use of mathematical modelling in the study of voting patterns and the correlations between spatial data. Both seem to have made a case that studying this is only possible with good quantitative data and an understanding of how people in these small spatial areas live, work, and think.
Miller's Models.
W.L. Miller, however, began work on quantifying the neighbourhood effect in 1977. In his work 'Electoral Dynamics' (1977) he formed the hypothesis that "people who talk together vote together" and began trying to quantify this controversial idea. He found that majority positions are more dominant than the socio-economic statistics of individuals in the area would suggest. He suggested four models by which voting patterns may be explained:
1) The "no environmental effect" model, which postulates no differences in voting behaviour by neighbourhood type – contacts with neighbours have no influence on how people vote. 
2) The "environmental effect model", which suggests that 'people may be irritated, alarmed and antagonized by contact with those unlike themselves' and become even stronger supporters of their 'class party' than might otherwise be the case – middle-class people are more pro-Conservative in working-class than middle-class areas, for example, and working-class people are less pro-Conservative in strongly middle-class areas. 
3) The "consensual environmental effect" model, which argues that 'people will be influenced towards agreement with their contacts', so that, for example, 'both middle- and working-class individuals are more Conservative in middle-class areas because both sets of individuals have fewer working-class contacts and more middle-class contacts than if they lived elsewhere' – which is what most writers associate with the neighbourhood effect.
4) The "Przeworski environmental effect" model, which suggests that the two classes operate in different ways – the middle class operate according to the reactive model in working-class areas, whereas the working class operate according to the consensual model in middle-class areas.
Johnston makes easier to understand social parallels that can be better understood by the layman. He explains these models as (1) I talk with them and vote as they do; (2) I want to be like them so I live with them; (3) I live among them and want to be like them; (4) what I observe around me makes me vote with them; and (5) they want me to vote for them here.
Cox.
Cox, in a similar attempt to understand the neighbourhood effect, attempted to define how people interact. He found that there was an inverse relationship between the distance and the formation of a relationship. This seems pretty straightforward and is easily applied to one's life. He also found that the relationships that people form typically have some sort of politically partisan undertones that people take in. He also found that these relationships have more of an effect on a person's political leanings than the person's prior predispositions. This is counter-intuitive because many have argued that a person will inherit their political leanings from their family.
Curtice argued against the social interaction model in 'Is Talking over the Garden Fence of Political Import?' Curtice argued, from his data set, that the influence on voting patterns by social interactions is of such small consequence as to be nearly negligible in explaining the neighbourhood effect.
Huckfeldt and Sprague Experiment.
The first group that attempted to find an empirical link between social interaction and voting patterns was R. Huckfeldt and J. Sprague. They did a survey of people in Indianapolis and St. Louis to find who people are and whom they talk to about politics. The group also interviewed the people that the respondents identified as those they would be most likely to talk to about politics. They definitively found that people do vote in similar ways to those that they interacted with. This data finally gave some backing to Miller's idea that "people who talk together vote together." All of these experiments seem to lend some credence to the models that Cox theorized and Miller formed.
Johnson, Phillips Shively and Stein.
The neighborhood effect has broadened the study of the voter from the individual level of analysis to account for the effect of where one lives on their voting decisions. This contribution to contextual analysis has broadened the study of voter behavior.

Rhug

Rhug (normally Y Rug in Welsh; sometimes given the antiquarian spelling Rûg) is a township in the parish of Corwen, Denbighshire, Wales, formerly in the old cantref of Edeirnion and later a part of Merionethshire, two miles from Corwen and ten miles north east of Bala. It includes the hamlet of Bonwen. It is situated near the River Dee, under Berwyn range. About 1150, it was ruled by the "Maer Du" or "Black Mayor of Rhug" and later became part of the lands of the barons of Edeirnion (see Hughes of Gwerclas) who ruled from Gwerclas Castle.
History.
The Lordship of Rhug contained the townships of Aber Alwen in the ecclesiastical parish of Corwen, which is where the manor house of Rhug was situated. It was apparently at Rhug that King Gruffudd ap Cynan was staying when he was betrayed by Meirion Goch of Llŷn, in 1080. Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester and Hugh, Earl of Salop, hearing that the prince was at Rhug came with a group of soldiers under the pretence of visiting him. Meirion Goch persuaded Gruffudd to go with a small guard to meet them, not knowing of the kidnapping plot by the earls, and was seized and carried off to Chester Castle. He was kept there for twelve years in chain and irons. The guards that accompanied Gruffudd were likewise taken prisoners, and after having been barbarously treated, and their right-hand thumbs cut off, were then allowed to go free. It was said that Owain Brogyntyn resided at Rhug after he became Lord of Dinmael and Edeirnion, and the lordship of Rhug devolved to the descendants of Bleddyn, Lord of Dinmael, the second son of Owain Brogyntyn. Margaret Wen, lady of Rhug, the sole daughter and heiress of Ieuan ap Howel ap Rhys, Lord of Rhug, married Piers Salusbury of Bachymbyd.
Rhug Chapel.
Colonel William Salisbury (1580-1660), affectionately known as "Old Blue Stockings", was a colourful character famed for his part as a Royalist in the defence of Denbigh Castle in the English Civil War. Although a warrior in early years, he later became a successful writer of Welsh verse and noted for his “high church” views. In 1637 he had a private chapel built in collaboration with Bishop William Morgan, who was sympathetic to Salisbury’s views and the first translator of the Bible into Welsh. The resulting private chapel, dedicated to The Holy Trinity, is quite plain and unremarkable to external view. A small construction in stone, a simple nave/chancel with access through a timber arched door at the west end of the church into an extremely small porch, and a door and porch at the north chancel wall for the use of the minister. Above the west door is a single external bell.
The chapel is set in pretty woodland some quarter mile from the busy A5 junction at Ty'n-y-cefn and maintained since 1990 by Cadw (a Welsh word meaning “to keep”, the historic environment service of the Welsh Assembly Government). On buying a joint ticket to see this chapel with the ancient church at Llangar, some three miles away, the visitor will assume that the chapel is as plain inside as out but nothing could be further from the truth. On passage through the heavy oak west door the visitor enters a very small porch with barely enough room for two people before a second timber door. On the right a wall holds a bell rope and to the left is a timber staircase leading through a quarter landing to the right and to the gallery. Taking the stairs will afford the visitor a remarkable view of a church so ornate and richly adorned to be completely in contrast to the plain exterior. Immediately and closely visible is the rood roof ornately decorated throughout with intertwining rose motifs. Wall panels are intricately carved and painted, elaborately carved and painted angels adorn the walls the colours bright and clear. (See Gallery).
The nave is separated from the chancel with a low rood screen of sturdy and ornately carved construction. Each window is finished with bright stained glass, of different ages, and with different depictions. The pews are built of oak and the aisle ends of the pews are, unusually, finished with huge oak timber scalloped plinth which are richly carved with beasts and birds. Large chandeliers provided the lighting and are supported on long iron rods from the roof. The nave is simple in contrast. The north wall bears a large painting of a memori morte, a recumbent skeleton designed to remind the congregation of their own mortality. Aart from the altar itself and tiled sanctuary, installed in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, all here is original despite the Protestant Reformation.
Outside the chapel, some 30 yards west of the West Door, is a pillar on a double stone base that appears to be a town or market cross though there is no obvious evidence of a settlement in this area and the chapel was built many centuries after such crosses were normally erected.
To the north of the West Door is a circular iron railing protecting memorial stones to the Wynn family. Inside the church is a memorial to Robert Vaughan of the estate of Nannau near Llanfachreth in Wales. He had interests in Rhug and oversaw restoration of the chapel with great sympathy to the original intent. Vaughan, in 1854, remodelled the exterior bell tower and windows yet left the interior virtually untouched despite the requirements of the recent restoration. The pews, however, were widened and provided with backs though finished in a colour and style similar to that of the original Neo-Jacobean. It is thanks to Robert Vaughan that we are able to glimpse the magnificence of a virtually untouched pre-Reformation church interior.

Cougars (30 Rock)

"Cougars" is the seventh episode of the second season of "30 Rock", and the twenty-eighth episode overall. It was written by co-executive producer John Riggi and directed by Michael Engler. Guest stars in this episode include Laura Berrios, Kevin Brown, Grizz Chapman, Val Emmich, Alan H. Green, Ian Hyland, John Lutz, Sean Moran, Maulik Pancholy, Ralph Peavy, Greg Scarnici, Blake Tyler Benitez and Mark Viera. 
In this episode, Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) goes on a date with a young, twenty year-old coffee delivery man named Jamie (Val Emmich). The date gets awkward due to the seventeen-year age difference between Liz and Jamie. This feeling escalates when Liz meets Jamie's mother (Laura Berrios). Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) gets a younger boyfriend of her own. Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) develops a crush on Jamie. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) helps Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to coach a Little League Baseball team.
Plot.
Liz develops a crush on Jamie, the new twenty year-old coffee delivery man, and after some initial hesitation, she agrees to go on a date with him. Before the date, Liz gets cold feet, but she is encouraged to attend by Jenna, who declares Liz a cougar, a term describing "hot older ladies pouncing on their young prey". Liz agrees and goes on a successful date with Jamie; the pair agree to go on a second date. Prior to this second date, Liz goes to Jamie's apartment only to discover that Jamie still lives with his mother, who looks exactly like Liz. 
Frank begins to question his sexuality when he realizes that he has a crush on Jamie. He even tries to, unsuccessfully, rival Liz to go on a date with Jamie. Later, Frank realizes that the only man he is attracted to is Jamie and decides that he is in fact not gay.
In order to become a cougar herself, Jenna starts to date Aidan, a teenage freshmen at New York University. Jenna breaks up with Aidan when he starts to annoy her by wearing heelies and playing portable video games and acting like Jenna is his mother. 
Tracy is ordered to do community service in the form of coaching the Knuckle Beach Little League Baseball Team. Knuckle Beach happens to be "the worst neighborhood in New York". Hoping to inspire the team, Jack agrees to help Tracy and he donates uniforms to the team on behalf of the Sheinhardt Wig Company which is NBC's fictitious parent company. Jack replaces Tracy with Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) because he realizes that even with the newfound inspiration from both Jack and Tracy, the team is still failing. The team begins to revolt when they find out that Tracy has been fired. To counter this, Jack forms a coalition with Tracy and they replace members of the team with Grizz and Dot Com (Grizz Chapman and Kevin Brown).
Production.
Scenes for this episodes were primarily filmed on October 5, 2007 at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, Queens, New York. During the commercial breaks in this episode, commercials for American Express were aired featuring "30 Rock" cast members, who were in character. These commercials featured Kenneth giving out "Secret Rodney" Christmas gifts to various other "30 Rock" characters. The commercials were aired in order to deter viewers, who were viewing the episode with Digital Video Recorders, from fast-forwarding through the commercial break.
The title of this episode, "", refers to a phrase from pop culture. The word cougar means an "older women who date younger men." In the episode, Jenna calls both herself and Liz "cougars" due to them both dating younger men. While speaking about his appearance on "30 Rock", Val Emmich, who played Jamie in this episode, said that he was initially "intimidated by Fey more than anyone else acted alongside." When asked if acting with Fey on "30 Rock" taught him anything, he replied that he learnt "that normal people can be in this business." He described Fey as "witty, smart [and sexy".
Reception.
"Cougars" was watched by 5.8 million viewers and it received a 2.5 rating and a 6 share in the 18–49 demographic. The 2.5 refers to 2.5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds in the U.S., and the 6 refers to 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television in the U.S. at the time of the broadcast. The episode ranked in first place, among men aged between 18–34, against all television being broadcast in the same timeslot. By comparison, CBS's "" was watched by 13.8 million viewers, a repeat of ABC's "Ugly Betty" was viewed by 6.5 million viewers and Fox's "Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?" was watched by 9.0 million viewers.
Bob Sassone of TV Squad felt that the best storyline was the one featuring Tracy and Jack because of the "Bush/Iraq metaphors and the sight of Alec Baldwin dressed as General MacArthur, standing beneath a 'Fun Accomplished' sign." Robert Canning of IGN thought that the best storyline of the episode was centered around Liz and Jamie, and rated the episode 8 out of 10. Matt Webb Mitovich of "TV Guide" wrote that this episode "had so many fun lines", and found himself "giggling, chuckling and LOLing like a fool". He liked "the 'cougars' storyline", saying it "was a lot of fun, because Liz is best when Liz is feeling awkward." Jeff Labrecque of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that "Jenna's Amber Alert affair with the soda-drinking, Heelys-gliding teenager" was "priceless". He also compared the interplay between Frank and Jamie to the relationship between Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) of "The Office".

List of Gankutsuou characters

"" is an anime series set in the year 5053. While the setting is largely futuristic, many of the buildings and dress styles are reminiscent of France in the 19th century. Gankutsuou shares the same basic plot as Le Comte de Monte-Cristo. However, in the Gankutsuou, there is a greater focus on Albert Morcerf and his friends as opposed to the book's focus on the Count. In addition, the anime portrays the Count in a far more negative, almost antagonistic, light. The story is largely that of a coming-of-age for Albert and his friends. Their plushy lifestyle is disrupted by the arrival of the Count, who sets his plan for revenge into motion.
The anime series features an extensive cast of characters, most of whom are based on Alexandre Dumas's French novel, Le Comte de Monte-Cristo.

Heaven's Gate (album)

"Heaven's Gate" is the first album by Norwegian symphonic power metal band Keldian. It was released worldwide in February 2007 by American label Perris Records, and was produced, engineered and mixed by Arild Aardalen.
The album presents a sound that combines the melodic hard rock and AOR of the 1980s with a more modern power and symphonic metal influence, and has been hailed as being an original take on the genres.
The lyrics deal with the concept of space travel and the future of mankind as a space travelling species, and represent the science-fiction influences that have become a Keldian trademark. Some reviewers have commented on how this sees the band escaping the Dungeons & Dragons straitjacket that seems to trap many artists in this genre of music. The band have cited the authors Peter F. Hamilton and Dan Simmons as being among their prime influences. It is also possible to detect spiritual, and maybe even religious, undertones to Keldian's lyrics, although this is also a regular feature in the science-fiction literature they seem to draw on.
"Heaven's Gate" was also released as a Japanese version, featuring a slightly remixed version of the song "Plains of Forever" as well as the bonus track "Hope".

Public transport in Manila

Public transport in Metro Manila is provided by light rail, rapid transit, commuter rail, bus, jeepney and taxi.
Rail services.
, there are two different rapid transit systems in Metro Manila: the Manila Light Rail Transit System, or the LRT, and the Manila Metro Rail Transit System, or the MRT. The Yellow Line (LRT-1) and the Purple Line (MRT-2) form the LRT network, while the Blue Line (MRT-3) forms the MRT network, with 29 stations on the LRT and 13 stations on the MRT . Four more lines are proposed and would connect Metro Manila to the provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal upon their completion.
The various lines are being coordinated in the "Strong Republic Transit System" under the following line names:
LRTA system.
Manila Light Rail Transit System has two lines, the Yellow Line that runs along the length of Taft Avenue (R-2) and Rizal Avenue (R-9), and the Purple Line that runs along Ramon Magsaysay Blvd (R-6) from Santa Cruz, through Quezon City, up to Santolan in Marikina City and Pasig City.
MRTC system.
The Manila Metro Rail Transit System, popularly known as the "MRT", "Metrostar Express" or "Metrostar", has a single line, MRT-3 or the Blue Line.
Commuter rail.
Philippine National Railways operates two main-line railway lines within Metro Manila, all part of the once-flourishing Luzon railway system. The northern line, known as Northrail and connecting Manila to Caloocan City, is currently closed. Line extensions are proposed to Valenzuela City and further on to Bulacan and Pampanga. The trans-Metro Manila portion of the still-open southern line, known as Southrail, commences at Tutuban station in Tondo, Manila, passes through the cities of Manila, Makati, Taguig, Parañaque and Las Piñas, and ends in Barangay Buli, Muntinlupa City, before entering the province of Laguna.
PNR commuter services connect Vito Cruz, Herran (Pedro Gil), Pandacan, Sta. Mesa, España, Laong Laan, Blumentritt and Tutuban.
The "Commex" and "Metrotren" services serve as the backbone of Metro Manila's regional rail services, serving Metro Manila's various train stations, as well as areas as far south as Calamba City in Laguna. Trains have various frequencies and can be seen (and heard) running throughout the day. Blue and orange-painted General Electric locomotives attached with Commex or Metrotren cars of the same colors can be seen especially by those driving on the South Luzon Expressway. Some of these trains have a white band with "NORTHRAIL" written on the bottom, which indicates that it is a northbound rail service, rather than the more common southbound rail service.
Bus.
Manila has many metrobus companies such as Erjohn & Almark, Baclaran Metro Link and AC Trans. These use Japanese buses (especially Isuzu or Nissan Diesel) converted to Left-hand drive. As such, the rear and emergency doors are swapped.
Jeepney.

The Running Man is a 1963 British drama film directed by Carol Reed, starring Laurence Harvey as a man who fakes his own death in a glider accident, then runs into trouble when an insurance investigator starts taking a close interest.
It was filmed in San Roque, Cádiz, Spain, Gibraltar and Ireland.
The film briefly came to the attention of the Warren Commission investigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy because of a viral marketing campaign which placed personal ads in the "Dallas Morning News" asking the "Running Man" to please call "Lee". Investigators thought that they might be coded messages placed by assassin Lee Harvey Oswald until they discovered the source of the advertisements. In Hollywood, an urban legend arose claiming that the film was a flop because it starred actors named Lee and Harvey.
Awards.
Cinematographer Robert Krasker — one of Carol Reed's favorites — was nominated for the BAFTA color cinematography award.

Alec Cunningham

Alec George Gordon Cunningham, born at Knowle, Somerset on 15 July 1905 and died at Keynsham, Somerset on 21 July 1981, was a cricketer who played two first-class matches for Somerset in the 1930 cricket season.
A lower-order batsman and wicketkeeper, Cunningham was picked as one of a series of temporary replacements for the regular Somerset wicketkeeper, Wally Luckes, who suffered ill-health over several seasons around 1930. 
Cunningham appeared first in the University match against Cambridge University at Fenners early in June, made 6 not out, his highest score, and took two catches and a stumping. Two weeks later, his second and final game was the home match at Taunton against Nottinghamshire. He made 2 not out batting at No 11 in the first innings and took one catch, but was then tried as a makeshift opener in the second Somerset innings, when the county batted again with very little time left on the second day. The move was not a success: Cunningham was out for 2 before the close of play, the only time in his first-class career when he was dismissed. 
He did not play first-class cricket again.

<doc id="20379700" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20379700" title="St John the Baptist's Church, Crawley">
St John the Baptist's Church, Crawley

St John the Baptist's Church is an Anglican church in Crawley, a town and borough in West Sussex, England. It is the parish church of Crawley, and is the oldest building in the town centre, dating from the 13th century—although many alterations have been made since, and only one wall remains of the ancient building.
History.
In the Norman era, Slaugham and Cuckfield were the most important places in the north of the county of Sussex. When Crawley first started to develop as a village in the 13th century, it was in the parish of Slaugham in the Hundred of Buttinghill (hundreds were ancient divisions of land covering several parishes). As the new village was distant from the parish church at Slaugham (St Mary's), several miles south, a stone church was built as a chapel of ease. It is known to have existed before 1267, when it was passed on in a will, and it was still the daughter church of Slaugham in 1291; but by the early 15th century it was referred to as a "free" church and a "permanent chantry". The parish of Crawley was therefore established separate from Slaugham at some point, probably by the end of the 14th century, and St John the Baptist's was regarded as its parish church by the time chantries were abolished in the 1540s. Crawley was a small, very narrow, split parish, and did not cover the whole of the village of Crawley: the boundary between it and the parish of Ifield—and between the Hundred of Buttinghill and the Hundred of Burbeach, in which Ifield lay—ran up the middle of the High Street. The detached part of Crawley parish consisted of heavily forested land and one farm near Pease Pottage. The total area of the parish was less than ; Ifield parish was six times larger, in contrast.
The first additions to the structure came in the 15th century, when a tall tower was added at the western end, the windows in the nave were enlarged and a rood screen was installed between the chancel and the nave. The nave roof was also rebuilt at this time, and the earliest surviving memorial carvings and stones in the church are also 15th-century.
By the 16th century, Crawley's development into a thriving market village meant that its the parish was much more important than that of Slaugham, and the connection between their two churches was legally severed. At least 150 people regularly attended the church, but its income was modest and priests frequently moved on to richer parishes. The building fell into disrepair in the 17th and 18th centuries, although the four cracked bells in the tower were replaced by London bell-founder Thomas Lester in 1742. Lester cast dozens of bells for Sussex churches, and reused the metal from the old bells in his work at Crawley.
Major changes took place in the 19th century. The tower partially rebuilt and heightened by 1814, although the original stone was reused. Some more work took place in 1845, but the greatest changes happened in 1879 and 1880. A new north aisle was added, a porch was built on the north side, the chancel was completely rebuilt and reordered, an organ chamber was built, and the bells were replaced by a new ring of eight bells, hung for change ringing, cast by Gillett, Bland & Company of Croydon. Nikolaus Pevsner has criticised the resulting appearance of the church, calling it "dully Victorian" and noting that its best feature is the unrestored 15th-century nave roof.
The church's location just east of the High Street meant that it was very close to the boundary of Ifield parish. People who lived on or around the west side of the High Street would often attend St John the Baptist's although their parish church was St Margaret's. One such worshipper was Mark Lemon, founding editor of the satirical magazine "Punch". Having adopted Crawley as his home town, he lived at Vine Cottage on the west side of the High Street, and regularly attended St John the Baptist's instead of St Margaret's. However, his substantial girth caused him problems: he had to sit in the gallery because there were no pews large enough to accommodate him in the nave.
The church, graveyard and church walk are haunted a number of paranormal sightings have happened over the years.
Architecture.
The church is built of Sussex limestone. The chancel roof is tiled, but the rest of the church is roofed with slabs of local stone. The south wall of the nave is original, although it has some 15th-century alterations; the nave ceiling is also from this era, and features wind bracing and tie beams. The tower, rebuilt in the 19th century, is in three stages and features mediaeval carvings. The pulpit is 17th-century; the altar rails are from that century or early in the 18th. There is some stained glass in the 19th-century north aisle and the east end of the chancel. The oldest internal fixture is the marble font, which is 13th-century.
The parish.
The modern parish covered by the church is much larger than the ancient parish of Crawley. It covers most of the town west and north of the railway line between Gatwick Airport and Crawley railway stations, and up to the boundary of the airport. The present boundary is defined by the A23 London Road from its junction with the Horsham Road in Southgate to the edge of the Manor Royal industrial estate at County Oak; the southern perimeter road of Gatwick Airport—incorporating all the land and buildings in the former village of Lowfield Heath; some farmland and residential development east of the railway line at Tinsley Green; the railway line from Tinsley Green to Southgate Avenue, near Crawley railway station; and the northern part of the Southgate neighbourhood.
There are five extant churches in the parish. St Peter's in West Green predates the New Town, having been built between 1892 and 1893 to a design by architect W. Hilton Nash. Richard Cook, owner of one of Crawley's main building firms, constructed it. It replaced a chapel of ease to St Margaret's Church, Ifield: although West Green was in the parish of Ifield at the time, it was remote from the parish church. Although the Diocese of Chichester would not pay for a separate church, it accepted St Peter's, which was built with private money, when it was offered. The church later gained its own parish, which was then absorbed by the parish of St John the Baptist. St Elizabeth's in the centre of the Northgate neighbourhood was built in 1965, and like St John the Baptist's follows a "Modern Catholic" style of worship. St Richard's is another modern church serving the Three Bridges neighbourhood. A fifth church, St Michael and All Angels, is notionally within the parish but is no longer used for Anglican worship. William Burges designed and built this yellow sandstone 13th century-style French Gothic church in 1867 to serve the village of Lowfield Heath, which was then in the parish of Charlwood in Surrey. The establishment and rapid development of Gatwick Airport next to Lowfield Heath swamped the small village, eventually destroying it: all buildings except the church, which was listed at Grade II* in 1948, were demolished to make way for warehouses and extensions to the airport boundary. (The church is approximately from the runway.) The Diocese of Chichester stopped using the church for services in 2004; in March 2008 it allowed a Seventh-day Adventist congregation to use the building as its place of worship. Horley Seventh-Day Adventist Church was formed as a church plant in May 2005 and was formally established in January 2008.
The church today.
St John the Baptist's was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 21 June 1948. It is one of the 12 Grade II* buildings, and 100 listed buildings of all grades, in the Borough of Crawley. There are two services every Sunday, one on Wednesday and one on Friday; a regular Bible study group and prayer group; and a Sunday school.

The Genie Family

The series was dubbed in English by Saban Entertainment in 1992 with the name Bob in a Bottle featuring a brand new theme song sung in reggae style, which later hit in Spanish, German, French, Danish and Hebrew. The English version did not air in the United States but it did air on YTV on Canada, on Australia's Seven Network in 1992 and on New Zealand's TV2 in 1994. The motto for the English version is "Make everyday like paradise" and "You sneeze, I please, that's the way it goes" which is one of Hakushon Daimao's catchphrases.
Plot.
An old bottle has found its way to a modern family. A genie named Bob, and his daughter, Illana, reside inside the bottle. It is owned by a boy named Joey. When he finds the bottle, he discovers that whenever anyone sneezes, the genie is brought out and must grant the wish of whoever sneezed. His daughter must do the same for whoever yawned. Getting these wishes granted may not be a good thing, though. Bob is extremely clumsy and usually messes them up. Illana is more capable than her father, but she is mischievous and likes to twist their words and meaning so that something bad usually comes of it.
Spinoffs.
The Hakushon Daimaō franchise made a comeback in the 2000s with two animated spinoff series produced by Tatsunoko and directed by Hiroshi Sasagawa, featuring Hakushon Daimaō's (Bob) daughter Akubi (Illana) as the central character.
Yobarete Tobedete! Akubi-chan.
"Yobarete, Tobidete! Akubi-chan" (26 episodes, 2001–2002) features Akubi (now voiced by Asuka Tanii) befriending a shy young girl named Koron Nemuta (voiced by Sakura Nogawa), who has a habit of yawning (thus summoning Akubi forth from her bottle) whenever she is embarrassed.
Akubi Girl.
Akubi returned in 2006's "Akubi Girl" (also 26 episodes), in which Akubi befriends first-grader Ruru-chan and attempts to help grant the girl's wish of becoming close friends with Itoshi-kun, the classmate on whom Ruru has a secret crush.

The main rebuildings were made by the noble Vrchlabsky family, between 1590 and the mid-16th century. Most of the architectural details from this period survive unchanged. One of the builders was Joachym Zoubek ze Zdetina (Joachym Zub ze Zdietina), who began work in the second half of the 16th century. His coat is still found in the top of one ceiling vault, with the text "JOACHIM ZVB ZE ZDIETINA A NA MOSSTIENICI KOMORNIK MENSSI ETC." The last meaningful reconstruction was made by Vaclav Eusebius Lobkowicz, who finished the 3rd floor of the building. In the 20th century, the castle was used as a block of flats. A restoration began in 1982, but was halted in 1990. As of 2006, the castle belongs to a private owner.

Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis

The Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis is a center for psychoanalytic research, training, and education that is located on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago. The institute provides professional training in the theory and practice of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. It was founded in 1932 by Franz Alexander, a pioneer in psychosomatic medicine at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute, who have moved to Chicago at the invitation of Robert Maynard Hutchins, then president of the University of Chicago. Notable psychoanalysts that have been associated with the institute include Karl Menninger, Karen Horney, Therese Benedek, Hedda Bolgar, Roy Grinker, Maxwell Gitelson, Louis Shapiro, Heinz Kohut, Arnold Goldberg, Jerome Kavka, and Michael Franz Basch.
History.
The Chicago Institute is the second oldest in the United States, preceded by New York five months earlier, and followed by Boston and Washington. It was incorporated on February 25, 1932, with Franz Alexander as the first Director. Alexander’s first associate was Karen Horney, who had been another student at the Berlin Institute. Alexander and Horney appointed three more to form the first staff. They were: Thomas French as Lecturer and Clinical Associate, Helen McLean and Catherine Bacon as Clinical Associates. There were also two visiting lecturers: Karl Menninger and Lionel Blitzstein.
From the beginning, the Chicago Institute has nurtured innovative, and occasionally revolutionary, approaches to the psychoanalytic theory and practice originally formulated by Sigmund Freud in Vienna. Alexander wanted to experiment with frequency of sessions, length of treatment and how the analyst should optimally conduct himself. He published his ideas in several books, and became an outspoken advocate for such experimentation. Alexander left Chicago for California in 1955. He was succeeded by Gerhard Piers as the Director of the Institute. The group of analysts who became the dominant voices at the Institute had been greatly influenced by Lionel Blitzstein, who had analyzed them all. Though Blitzsten had been on the early faculty of the Institute, he and Alexander were at odds. With his ascendance the Institute reinstated practices that were considered more in line with the dominant American view of depth and intensity of psychoanalytic treatment. The intellectual leader of this group was Maxwell Gitelson. Joan Fleming became Dean of Education, and the curriculum emphasized a more thorough historical approach to teaching psychoanalysis. 
The decade of the 60’s witnessed one of the most vibrant creative periods in the Institute’s history. Two important theoretical developments occurred. One was a collective research project that concerned parent loss. Fleming's research group observed that there seemed to be an arrest of the personality at the age of the child when the parent died, associated with an absence of mourning. From these findings, the group reasoned that intervention at the time of the loss - i.e., in childhood - would effectively prevent later psychological problems. Ten years later, in 1976, the Barr-Harris Children’s grief center opened its doors. 
The second major development was the groundbreaking work of Heinz Kohut, who developed his own ideas about the central role of empathy as defining the field of psychoanalysis - a position he staked out in 1959. Kohut had observed the intense reactions that would occur when patients were engaged with others who had not functioned as a needed part of themselves and hence caused injury to that most vital part of their being. But it was this being-part-of that had deep implications for the understanding of both development and treatment. Paradoxically, the understanding of the essential role of the “other” became a psychology of the “self”. All of this offered another, additional way of looking at what the classical theory had charted in its terms. Self psychology has had (and continues too have) an enormous impact on psychoanalytic thought and practice throughout the world.
In the midst of all this groundbreaking intellectual work, the Institute also launched a number of innovative programs. In 1962 it began the Child Therapy Program, the first of its kind in the country. Graduates of the Child Therapy Program have staffed and trained legions of agencies and treatment facilities of all kinds and have been the source of quality child psychotherapy over the last 45 years. A few years later, in 1965, Kay Field began the Teacher Education Program that educated teachers and school personnel about the nature of emotional development and helped them recognize and deal with problems in that development. The program reached hundreds of school personnel. In 1973, under the direction of then-director George Pollock, the Institute began the yearly publication of the Annual of Psychoanalysis. It remains the only Institute in the country - and the world - to sponsor, edit and produce an important academic journal. The 70’s also saw the inauguration of the most complete catalogue of psychoanalytic literature assembled to that point, The Chicago Psychoanalytic Index. Begun in 1970 and continued until 1989, this was the standard reference work for most American psychoanalysts until the recent advent of centralized computer cataloguing. The psychoanalytic library out of which this work arose began with the founding of the Institute and grew to be one of the three most complete psychoanalytic collections in the world.
In 2013 Erika Schmidt became the first female director of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. 
Education Programs.
The Chicago Institute offers a variety of pathways to facilitate psychoanalytic learning. The fellowship program is open to advanced trainees and recent graduates in psychiatry, psychology, and social work who are interested in psychoanalysis as a framework with which to understand and carry out clinical work. Participants meet for a monthly seminar. Fellows also meet monthly with a mentor to discuss readings, cases and other relevant topics. The Adult Psychotherapy Program is a two year curriculum that is equally divided between clinical and didactic courses. Students learn to do diagnostic evaluations from a dynamic point of view, including dynamic formulations. They also have supervision with an analyst once a week to help with patients they currently have in treatment. The Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy Program is a 4 year program to train mental health workers who treat children and adolescents. Students complete a variety of diagnostic evaluations of children and their families with a dynamic perspective, in addition to several long-term psycho-analytically-oriented supervised cases. The core Psychanalytic Education Program provides training in the practice of psychoanalysis. This is a 5 year curriculum, but completion of the program frequently requires additional years to finish the clinical work required for graduation. Students must undergo a personal analysis that begins before matriculation into coursesStudents treat at least three people in analysis under supervision of an analyst.
In collaboration with Rush University, the Institute also offers the CORST program to Ph.D.s from a variety of non-clinical academic field, who wish to become psychoanalysts.. It is designed to provide such students experience in general psychiatry and psychotherapy as preparation for psychoanalytic training. CORST is a 17 month program in which the student shares many of the courses given to residents in Psychiatry at Rush Medical College. Concurrently, they see several patients in psychotherapy under the supervision of analysts on the faculty of the Institute.
Clinical Services.
The Clinics of the Institute for Psychoanalysis provide psychoanalytically informed services to adults, adolescents, and children in the Chicago area at a greatly reduced fee. All therapists and analysts are highly experienced clinicians trained in psychiatry, psychology, social work, or counseling. Many have advanced training in psychoanalysis or psychotherapy.
Psychoanalytic treatments are based on the belief that emotional difficulties are often the result of thoughts and feelings outside of a person's awareness. By exploring and working through these issues in the safety of a trusting relationship with a therapist, one can experience lasting changes. Present stresses and crises are also contributors to one's sense of well-being and can be an important focus for therapeutic intervention.
In 1976, the Institute for Psychoanalysis established the Barr-Harris Children's Grief Center to meet the needs of children who have lost a parent or significant loved one through death, divorce, or abandonment. The Center's mission is to provide therapeutic services to bereaved children and their families; to make intervention more accessible; to heighten awareness of the potentially harmful short- and long-term effects of loss; and to provide training and consultation for teachers, clergy, mental health workers, and other involved community members.
In addition to its main location at the Institute for Psychoanalysis in downtown Chicago, the Center has established programs at four Chicago area locations: Highland Park Hospital serving the north suburbs, Little Company of Mary Hospital serving the south suburbs, La Rabida Children's Hospital serving the city's south side, and Swedish Covenant Hospital serving the city's north side. More recently, the Center has opened a sixth location at the Riverdale Community Resource Center in Riverdale, IL.

Sacred Heart Elementary (Carbondale)

Sacred Heart Elementary School is a Roman Catholic elementary school that formed in 2000 on the west side of Carbondale, Pennsylvania (U.S.), on Farview Street. It is the result of a merger between St. Rose Elementary School and Mt. Carmel Elementary School. The school team is called the Crusaders, with team colors of Blue and Gold. As of 2010-2011, Sacred Heart enrolled 187 students in grades PreK through 8, with student/teacher ratio: 11.98. The school is associated with the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA).
Most graduates have attended Holy Cross High School (Pennsylvania) or Carbondale Area High School for high-school classes. For the 2011-2012 school year, Sacred Heart will close and integrate into the LaSalle Academy Catholic School, located in Dickson City and Jessup.
History.
The two schools which combined to make up the newly named Sacred Heart Elementary School were formed in the 1800s and were located less than a mile (1.6 km) from each other. St. Rose Elementary was formed in 1871 and was part of the St Rose of Lima Parish, which had a large Irish immigrant population. Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Elementary was formed in 1892 and was part of the Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Parish which had a large Italian immigrant population. Originally, both elementary schools enjoyed a large enrollment, and the teachers of both elementary schools were exclusively nuns. Both schools housed a convent for the nuns who taught and ran each school. In 1921, St. Rose, then the larger of the two, expanded and built a high school, as St. Rose High School. In 1954, a new high school was built on the corner of 7th Avenue and N. Church Street. In 1963, Mt. Carmel Elementary built a new school on Farview Street, which serves as the current school site.
Consolidations.
In 1997, the school system was reorganized in Carbondale. The two elementary schools, St. Rose and Mt. Carmel Elementary, combined to form one school system called Sacred Heart Elementary School, which operated out of both original school sites. St. Rose High was renamed Sacred Heart High School. Grades PreK-2 were in the St. Rose Elementary building, and grades 3–6 were in the Mt. Carmel building, with grades 7–12 in the high-school building located near St Rose Parish. In 2000, grades PreK-2 were relocated to the Mt. Carmel building, and grades 4–6 were moved to the high school and operated separately from the high school as Sacred Heart Intermediate. The St. Rose Elementary building remains vacant to this day, except for Catechism classes on Sunday.
Loss of the High School.
The 2004–2005 school year was the last operating year for Sacred Heart Intermediate and Sacred Heart High. The newly instated Bishop Martino decided to close grades 9–12 due to a debt and low enrollment which always occurred in the transition from sixth grade to seventh grade, during which over 50% of the students would leave. Those students transferred to the public high school, which had a more competitive program with activities and curricular strengths, neither of which Sacred Heart's high school could compete with, only having 90–130 students during the last years. Despite a campaign run by the school which raised the entire $250,000 debt in pledges in a mere two weeks, the bishop's decision remained final, and the school closed in June 2005. The last graduation ceremony was held in the auditorium/gym and graduated 14 students.
Closure.
Sacred Heart Elementary School is set to close at the end of the 2010-2011 school year, with its students being incorporated into LaSalle Academy. With the elementary school's closure, over one century of formal Catholic education in Carbondale will be brought to a close.

Georgia State Route 115

State Route 115 (SR 115) is a state highway that runs west-to-east in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. It travels through portions of Lumpkin, White, and Habersham counties.
Route description.
SR 115 begins just northeast of the Chestatee River at an intersection with US 19/SR 60 (South Chestatee Street), south of Dahlonega, in Lumpkin County. This intersection marks the northern terminus of SR 400. South of this intersection, US 19/SR 400 make up the Hospitality Highway, a freeway that provides access to Atlanta. It heads northeast to an intersection with SR 52, east of the town. The two routes run concurrent to the southeast for a little over . In a curving fashion, SR 115 heads northeast into White County and intersects with the western terminus of SR 284 (Shoal Creek Church Road). Then, it enters Cleveland, where it meets US 129/SR 11 (Main Street). On the eastern edge of town is Truett-McConnell College. Just east of the town is an intersection with the western terminus of SR 255. To the southeast is SR 384 (Duncan Bridge Road). Immediately after is an intersection with the eastern terminus of SR 254. About later, the route passes over the Chattahoochee River into Habersham County. To the northeast is an intersection with SR 105 (Cannon Bridge Road). Just before entering Clarkesville, Georgia is an intersection with the southern terminus SR 17 Connector and the beginning of a concurrency with SR 17 (Unicoi Turnpike). The tow highways travel to the southeast until it enters the town. Almost immediately is a crossing over the Soque River. They curve to the northeast until they intersect SR 197/SR 385 (Washington Street, which is part of the old route of US 441). At this intersection, SR 115 ends, and SR 17 heads south concurrent with SR 197/SR 385. The highway is mostly rural, except for the segments in Cleveland and Clarkesville. 
All of SR 115 west of the intersection with SR 105 is part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

Lawyers Hill Historic District

The Lawyers Hill Historic District is a national historic district located at Elkridge, Howard County, Maryland. The district encompasses a broad array of architectural styles ranging from 1738 Georgian Colonial to 1941 Georgian Revival. The collection of Victorian domestic architecture built during the 1840s to 1880s is unparalleled in the county, with no two houses the same. Some of the later cottages were designed by Philadelphia architect Brognard Okie. There are variations of the American Gothic Revival form, Italianate, Queen Anne, and Shingle-style structures. There is also a range of Colonial Revival houses, from craftsman era rustic cottages to more formal Georgian, and mass-produced Dutch Colonial models from the early 20th century.
The area developed originally in the 19th century as a summer community and early commuter suburb for prominent Baltimoreans. With the opening of the Thomas Viaduct in 1836, the Patapsco Valley south of the river was easily accessible to Baltimoreans. Many of the first residents were respected lawyers and doctors active in many of the professional and cultural organizations still vital in the state today. During the 1840s, as railroad service improved, Lawyers Hill residents began commuting to Baltimore on a daily and weekly basis, establishing the community as the state's first railroad commuter suburb.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
