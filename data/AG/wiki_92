Germanic Trias

The Germanic Trias Supergroup () is a lithostratigraphic unit (a sequence of rock strata) in the subsurface of large parts of western and central Europe (north of the Alps) and the North Sea. Almost all of the Germanic Trias was deposited during the Triassic period and consists of three clearly different units: Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk and Keuper, that gave the period its name ("Triassic" means "threefold"). In the past the names of these three units were also used as units in the geologic timescale, but in modern literature they only have a lithostratigraphic meaning.
Origin.
The Germanic Trias formed in the large Germanic Basin, a basin that covered much of midwestern Europe (including the south of the North Sea and Baltic Sea) during the Triassic. The Muschelkalk has a predominantly marine facies whereas the Buntsandstein and Keuper are mostly continental.
Stratigraphy.
In the central parts of the Germanic Basin, the Germanic Trias has an average thickness of 800 meters, but regional differences are considerable. In the north of Germany the thickness of the Buntsandstein alone can exceed 1400 meters. The Germanic Trias lies on top of the Permian Zechstein Group and below Lower Jurassic units, such as the Lias Group or Altena Group.
The base is not defined in the same way everywhere. In northern Germany the base is formed by the Calvörde Beds, in the Spessart and Odenwald by the base of the Heigenbrücken-Sandstone. Radiometric dating has shown the age of the Germanic Trias is not totally corresponding with the Triassic period. The base of the Buntsandstein was formed during the Changhsingian, the uppermost stage of the Permian, about . The top of the Keuper is Rhaetian in age and at about at least a few million years older than the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Usually there is a stratigraphic hiatus between the base of the Lias and top of the Germanic Trias.
In German lithostratigraphy, Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk and Keuper are seen as groups. Dutch lithostratigraphy divides the Germanic Trias along other boundaries in a Lower Germanic Trias Group and an Upper Germanic Trias Group. The Dutch Keuper and Muschelkalk have the status of formations while the Dutch Buntsandstein is subdivided in a number of formations. The Bunter of British stratigraphy is similar in age, lithology and facies to the Buntsandstein.

South African wireless community networks

South African wireless community networks are wireless networks that allow members to talk, send messages, share files and play games independent of the commercial landline and mobile telephone networks. Most of them use WiFi technology and many are wireless mesh networks. A wireless community network may connect to the public switched telephone network and/or the Internet, but there are various restrictions on connectivity in South Africa. Wireless community networks are particularly useful in areas where commercial telecommunications services are unavailable or unaffordable.
Development of Wireless User Group (WUG) infrastructure and applications in the cities helps train members in wireless technology skills and provides a proving ground for new technology and applications that may have large social benefits in informal communities and rural areas of South Africa and neighboring countries.
Background: South African Telecommunications Environment.
South Africa has the best developed and most modern telephone system in Africa. There are almost 110 combined fixed-line and cellular telephones per 100 persons. There are 5.1 million Internet users. The network is 99.9% digital. The fixed-line monopoly of Telkom SA, a listed company in which the government is the largest shareholder, expired with the licensing of Neotel as South Africa's second national operator, starting operations in November 2007. Neotel is licensed to provide the entire range of telecoms services with the exception of full mobility. Neotel is expanding their network fast, but so far is concentrating on urban areas. The South African mobile communications market is growing fast. The country's three cellular network operators (Vodacom, MTN and Cell C) have over 39-million subscribers, or nearly 80% of the population.
However, although there are now over one million broadband subscribers, mostly using ADSL or HSDPA,
bandwidth remains relatively limited and expensive. Major cities such as Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg and Pretoria have launched public-private initiatives to build their own broadband networks to provide cheaper voice and data services. For example, the city of Tshwane, which includes Pretoria, is testing delivery of broadband Internet and voice services on their new metro-wide fibre-optic network using wireless hot spots to provide ADSL access. In the meantime, the high cost of broadband access has stimulated development of Wireless User Groups. The WUGS are not allowed to sell internet connectivity, since they are non-commercial community networks. Although non-profit and operating in the license-exempt spectrums, their legal status is not clear. In October 2007, JAWUG requested clarification on whether it required a radio frequency spectrum and/or ECNS license for its activities.
Telkom provides relatively poor voice and internet service in underdeveloped rural areas of South Africa, although it is investigating ways to improve service using wireless technology. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa has licensed several small telecoms firms to operate regional networks in remote, under-served areas of the country.
Bokone Telecoms in Polokwane and Amathole Telecoms in the Eastern Cape are experimenting with WiMAX technology to provide service. However, due to relatively high costs and low revenue potential, these initiatives are moving slowly. There is room for more innovative approaches.
Currently, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) service is allowed only in areas where less than five percent of the population have access to a telephone, and WiFi is restricted to use by individuals or organisations within the confines of their own premises. The argument is that low-cost or free VoIP over WiFi would destroy the incentive for commercial network providers to upgrade rural networks. However, several commentators consider that this policy is counter-productive. As discussed later, many wireless community networks deliberately ignore the restrictions.
Sample City-Based Wireless Community Networks.
Most cities in South Africa have one or more non-profit groups collaborating in running Wireless User Groups. Descriptions of a sample are given below, with information derived from their web sites.
Johannesburg WUG (JAWUG).
Jawug is located in Johannesburg, the largest city in South Africa. Jawug was the first wireless user group in South Africa, starting as an experimental network between two people, then quickly expanding into a much larger network by interconnecting several separate wireless mesh networks. 
Jawug is not an ISP. Its network is used purely for non-commercial and educational purposes.
Jawug is regularly used for experimental deployment of new technologies. There are currently four links which interconnect the Jawug network with PTAWUG, the Wireless User Group in Pretoria, to the north of Johannesburg. Jawug and PTAWUG work together closely - Jawug helped to get PTAWUG off the ground. Jawug also gives technical assistance to new wireless users groups like Port Elizabeth Wireless Users Group (PEWUG). A core team of members manage all routing and highsite maintenance. Regular wugmeets are held to discuss network issues and future plans.
Jawug has a membership base of approximately 300 locations, and is constantly expanding.
Pretoria WUG (PTAWUG).
The Pretoria WUG was founded on 28 July 2007. The PTAWUG constitution guarantees openness, free participation and equality to all members of the Wireless User Group. PTAWUG is exclusively funded by donations from the community. Volunteers conduct highsite installation and maintenance in their spare time. PTAWUG is the 5th largest wireless network organization in the world with about 600 member connections (7 October 2009). To avoid rental costs, all highsites are on privately owned properties, mostly in high areas with a good line of sight to the surrounding areas. The network has a number of towers, with the other highsites located on tall buildings or at private residences in strategic places.
The Pretoria Wireless Project is another community based network in the city, which has been connected to the Pretoria WUG network as of 3 February 2008.
Cape Town Wireless User Group (CTWUG).
The Cape Town Wireless User Group has been around since about 2005 as a small network between friends. Since then it has grown to a city-wide network. CTWUG has 950 user sites all around Cape Town - spanning all the way from Houtbay to Stellenbosch and into the Helderberg. CTWUG is a non-profit organisation that is geared towards community based wireless networking with a focus to promote the use and understanding of wireless equipment in order to build a city wide free wireless network. The building of this network forms a social and interactive community where people with an interest in expanding and improving the network donate time, money and equipment to the group.
CTWUG runs many network enhancements, including a GameTime system which stops all bulk traffic during certain hours for gaming and other high-priority network uses. CTWUG puts a lot of priority in making sure the network is usable for as many applications and uses as possible.
No monthly or annual fees of any kind is asked for membership and all contributions are completely voluntary. CTWUG maintains good vendor relationships to ensure high quality equipment is used and supplied for all network links. 
Durban Wireless Community.
The Durban Wireless Community was founded in December 2004 by a group of people interested in 802.11 a/b/g wireless technology in Durban, the third most populous city in South Africa. The first meeting in January 2005 had 4 attendees. The group now has about 200 people on the mailing list and about 15 live nodes on the network spanning from Bluff to Umbilo, Morningside, Town, Tollgate and Westville. Goals of the non-profit group, which is free to join and open to all, include educating the public about wireless technology, and learning more about the technology. The Durban Wireless Community has close ties to JAWUG.
Potchefstroom Community Network.
The Potchefstroom Community Network is a non-profit grassroots effort by members of the community to provide a broadband network between its members, using inexpensive off-the-shelf (WiFi) radio networking equipment. The network operates in the license-exempt 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum.
Stellenbosch Community Network.
The Stellenbosch Community Network is a joint project between Stellenbosch University and the Stellenbosch Local Municipality in Cape Province, South Africa. Its purpose is to provide the community with wireless access to University and Municipality services. The network is in a pilot phase. It will be operated as an open public network, accessible to anyone with the right equipment.
Rural Wireless Community Networks.
Although the city-based community networks are typically run by hobbyists who may be primarily interested in experimenting with technology and avoiding high broadband charges while playing Internet games, they serve also as test beds for more serious projects and training grounds for wireless network engineers that may benefit projects in poor rural and informal communities. In these communities, wireless mesh networks may have great medical, educational and economic value, giving affordable telephone and internet access when coupled with initiatives such as One Laptop per Child that aim to provide low-cost devices - assuming the regulator continues to remove obstacles to deploying WiFi community networks.
Meraka Institute.
The Meraka Institute is a government-backed organization to promote ICT development. The Wireless Africa programme of the Meraka Institute is researching ways to develop sustainable information and communications technology in developing countries. Research follows two tracks:
Peebles Valley Mesh Project.
The Peebles Valley mesh project is using wireless mesh networking as a low cost first mile solution connect people to
the internet and each other. The project is testing if a rural community can take ownership of the network, with a trial community-run WUG near the Kruger National Park in the Mpumalanga Province. The project uses "Cantennas" to connect to the wireless mesh network. These are small, self-constructed antennas made from locally available material connected to a low-cost WiFi card plugged into a computer. Although sponsored by the Meraka Institute, the project members state that what they are doing is illegal under current laws.
UWC Telehealth.
Another project, UWC Telehealth, is testing a system in a remote rural part of the Eastern Cape in South Africa that lets nurses and doctors use a wireless IP-based communication system to conduct patient referrals, request ambulance services and order supplies. The project ran into difficulties at first because Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) was illegal in South Africa, even over the UWC Telehealth network. The regulator removed this restriction, but there are still legislative obstacles to providing Internet access, which the project directors are challenging.
Orange Farm and the Mesh Potato.
Orange Farm is an informal settlement of about 300,000 people south of Johannesburg. Most people cannot afford mobile phones, and cannot afford to use the Internet cafes. However Dabba, a telecommunications company, is providing affordable telephone service in Orange Farm through wireless mesh technology.
Dabba has installed several wireless routers that relay signals to an internet connection in a local community centre. Anyone within range of one of the routers can make phone calls using a Wi-Fi or SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) telephone. Calls within the network are free, and Dabba supports low-cost prepaid calls to telephones on other networks. However, the phones average about $100 each and it takes significant technical knowledge and investment to build a network like this, so the model may not work in poorer rural communities.
Dabba is now working with the Shuttleworth Foundation, a non-profit South African charitable organization, in the Village telco project to develop an affordable and easy-to-install telephone system for rural communities. The goal was to design a system costing no more than US$5000 to get started, which a small-scale local entrepreneur could afford, and which would break even within six months. The project came up with the concept of a "mesh potato", a cheap device (perhaps $60 per unit) that can connect a standard analog telephone to the wireless network and also serves as a wireless mesh node, relaying signals from other mesh potatoes to a central wireless internet connection. Dabba (and other companies with a similar model) will provide advice to wireless community network owners and connectivity to the outside world. The technology has been tested and several manufacturers are showing interest in building the devices. The Village Telco concept may have potential in many other countries outside South Africa.

<doc id="20514254" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20514254" title="Æbelholt Abbey">
Æbelholt Abbey

Æbelholt Abbey () was an Augustinian monastery situated in Tjæreby, 5 km west from Hillerød in Region Hovedstaden, Denmark.
History.
William of Æbelholt.
The monastery was first established on Eskilsø Island in Roskilde Fjord in 1104. While no remains of the wooden abbey have survived, the stone abbey church there still remains, though in ruins. It was 24 meters long and had a nave, choir, and apse in the Romanesque style. The monks became "unruly" and Bishop Absalon of Roskilde, determined to obtain a new Augustinian superior, sent for his friend, William, abbot of the abbey of Sainte-Geneviève in Paris. When William arrived in 1165 with three French canons there were only six religious left at Eskilsø, two of whom were dismissed when they refused to submit to the new rule.
In 1167 the abbey moved to Æbelholt in Tjæreby, supported by a donation of land from Absalon in Tjæreby Parish and endowed with several income-producing farms, tithes from many north Zealand churches, and several mills. The monastery on Eskilsø was closed. The first church and abbey at Æbelholt were made of timber. Construction began almost immediately on a new abbey church of limestone which was completed in 1210.
Abbot William experienced considerable initial difficulties. The three French canons returned to Paris, finding conditions in Denmark too bleak. A few of the Danish canons plotted to murder him when he ordered that they eat "herbs and leaves" instead of their usual meals. The "Life of St. William" notes some of the ways in which they considered killing him, either by setting fire to a pile of straw near his bed in the dormitory, putting him in a sack and drowning him, or taking an axe to him. Eventually William's piety, fairness, wisdom, and intelligence won them and the local populace over. He was considered a saint in his own lifetime. He was highly regarded by several kings of Denmark and served as an intermediary between the pope and the Danish monarchy.
Abbot William died on 5 April 1203 at the age of 75. Miracles at his grave and in connection with his relics brought pilgrims in great numbers, and the abbey developed into the greatest Augustinian house in the north. By 1210 the list of miracles and signs recorded was so great that the Archbishop of Lund, Anders Sunesen, petitioned Pope Honorius III for his canonization. In 1219 the pope authorized several bishops to investigate the claims with an eye to making William a saint. The result was a book "The Life of Abbot William" which was submitted for the pope's consideration.
William was canonised in 1224. On 16 June 1238 with great ceremony William's body was translated to lie inside the high altar in the new abbey church. A small separate chapel was constructed over the his previous grave, so pilgrims could visit without disturbing the monks. In time relics of Saint William were given to Roskilde Cathedral, Lund Cathedral, the Church of Our Lady ("Vor Frue Kirke") and Greyfriars Church in Copenhagen, and Greyfriars Church in Roskilde.
Later history.
By 1230, the monastery housed 25 canons regular, but fed about 100 persons daily. This wide hospitality was funded, as were the abbey's other expenditures, by the revenues of its estates, situated locally and also in Copenhagen and in Halland, and from the dues from the nearby market. Augustinians were interested in farming and improving crops. They hired lay brothers to do the farm work and oversee the temporal affairs of the abbey.
The abbey complex consisted of a quadrangular set of buildings with the church as the north range, round a central cloister and cloister garth. The buildings were constructed of brick, the most common building material at the time. One of the most unusual parts of the abbey was the lavatory which had running water from a ditch, on which it is possible a mill also stood.
The church was expanded before 1324 with a longer nave, a crossing, and choir with an apse. Several side chapels were added dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Saint John the Baptist, Saint John the Evangelist and Saint George. The high altar was dedicated to Saint Thomas.
Reformation in Denmark.
After the Reformation in 1535 all religious houses and their income properties reverted to the crown. The abbey church was converted to the large parish church for Tjæreby and Alsønderup Parishes, while the conventual and service buildings were granted as a fief to Christoffer Trundsen in 1544, with the provision that he should maintain the last remaining canons under Abbot Anders Ibsen. The abbey was formally dissolved in 1560; Abbot Ibsen was sent to the Carmelite priory in Helsingør where he died a year later.
In 1555 the parishioners complained that the abbey church was too big to maintain, and the royal order to demolish the entire abbey complex was given in 1561. The parish churches at Tjæreby and Alsønderup were spared. Much of the stone and brick was reused to construct the nearby Frederiksborg Castle and in local farms.
Recent history and present day.
The site was excavated in the 1930s and 1950s, and the finds are now displayed in the Æbelholt Abbey Museum ("Æbelholt Klostermuseum"). The outlines of the abbey church and complex have been exposed, as have the pillars from the refectory. Some of the many skeletons discovered during the excavations are on display and provide much information on historical illnesses and medical treatments.
Monastery garden.
A monastic garden was made here in 1957 as a reconstruction of the famous garden at the Abbey of St. Gall in Switzerland. The garden contains over a hundred medicinal plants known to have grown in such gardens in Denmark in the Middle Ages.
The Folk Museum in Hillerød has published a little volume entitled "Æbelholt Klosterhave af Kirsten Baunegaard" describing the herbs and medicinal plants in the garden.
Æbelholt Abbey Market.
Almost from the time the abbey was established here a market has been held alongside, initially beginning on 16 June, the feast day of the abbey's founder, Saint William. Formerly the market lasted for 14 days.
The market is now under the auspices of the Folk Museum in Hillerød, who have arranged it every year from 1998; it now lasts for a weekend.

Congo floor maggot

Auchmeromyia senegalensis, known as the Congo floor maggot, is a species of blow-fly that is native to sub Saharan Africa and the Cape Verde Islands.
"A .sengalensis" is an atypical myiasis species which does not live on or in the host, but sucks the blood of burrow-dwelling wild pigs, warthogs, aardvark, hyena and occasionally sleeping humans (sanguinivorous myiasis). "Auchmeromyia" is the only known genus of blood sucking maggot to feed on mammals although others feed on birds. There are five described species in the genus.
Female flies lay their eggs on dry earth or the earthen floors of huts.Larvae feed for about twenty minutes, sometimes daily, and then fall to the ground. There are three larval instars and pupation lasts two weeks. The entire life cycle takes ten weeks and is continuous throughout the year. Fully grown maggots are 18 mm long. Male flies have an exceptionally long second segment and widely separated eyes.
Whilst causing irritation and swelling Congo floor maggots are not known to transmit disease. Bites are easily avoided by providing beds.

Defensio Secunda

Defension Secunda was a 1654 political tract by John Milton, a sequel to his "Defensio pro Populo Anglicano". It is a defence of the Parliamentary regime, by then controlled by Oliver Cromwell; and also defense of his own reputation against a royalist tract published under the name Salmasius in 1652, and others criticism lodged against him.
Background.
Only a few months after Cromwell was made Lord Protector over England, Milton published a tract titled "Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio Secunda". The work was one of the last times that Milton discussed Cromwell's character. It is a defence of the Parliamentary regime, controlled by Cromwell, and sought the support of a European audience. In addition to this purpose, the work serves a reply to the attacks on his "Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce" by Herbert Palmer and attacks on his "Defensio pro Populo Anglicano" by Salmasius. A further anonymous pamphlet attack from the royalist side, "Regii sanguinis clamor ad coelum", he rebutted with an "ad hominem" attack on Alexander Morus, whom Milton wrongly took to be the actual author (who was in fact Pierre Du Moulin). Milton used scurrilous gossip against Morus; scholars have decided that his sources of scandal were at least reasonably accurate.
However, the act of writing further strained his failing eyes, to the extent that he could no longer rely on his sight.
Tract.
Milton begins his work by addressing claiming to fight for truth and freedom who will help reform Europe: 
He continues by discussing parts of his life, and explains why he writes instead of fighting as a soldier: 
After defending why he writes, Milton explains his purpose in writing: 
It is the renewed cultivation of freedom and civic life that I disseminate throughout cities, kingdoms, and nations. But not entirely unknown, nor perhaps unwelcome, shall I return if I am he who disposed of the contentious satellite of tyrants, hitherto deemed unconquerable, both in the view of most men and in his own opinion. When he with insults was attacking us and our battle array, and our leaders looked first of all to me, I met him in single combat and plunged into his reviling throat this pen, the weapon of his choice.
After Milton was accused of being a worse person than Cromwell, he wrote in the work that it was "the highest praise you could bestow on me". Later in the tract, Milton discusses his "Areopagitica" and argues that in the work, he warns against the idea of truth being determined by a limited few. Milton also discusses his early divorce tracts, claiming that they were a discussion of religious freedom, domestic freedom, and civil freedom, the "three varieties of liberty without which civilized life is scarcely possible".
Themes.
Milton, through the work, becomes a defender of the individual against the control of a government or religious authority. He also attacks the concept of titles and other forms of pomp, a theme that reoccurs later in the figure of Satan from his "Paradise Lost". Besides discussing his views on politics, Milton dwells on parts of his biography, including a description of his early years with education and literature.

Gigabyte (virus writer)

Kimberley Vanvaeck, mostly known by her online moniker Gigabyte, is a Belgian female virus writer known for taking part in a long running dispute with Sophos employee Graham Cluley. Prior to her arrest in 2004 Vanvaeck wrote several viruses such as Quis, Coconut, Sahay, Sharp, and YahaSux, which she claims were written with the intent to send them to companies as a proof-of-concept as opposed to releasing them on the Internet. She began writing viruses when she was 14 years old and was 17 at the time of her arrest. Her Sharp virus (also called "Sharpei") is credited as being the first virus to be written in C Sharp, which Vanvaeck wrote to prove that it was possible to write a virus in C Sharp. 
Vanvaeck's dispute with Clueley began after he made several comments concerning the gender of virus writers, as Clueley believed that most were male. This prompted Vanvaeck to write several viruses that specifically targeted Cluely as the subject of ridicule. Vanvaeck also claimed to be part of the Metaphase VX Team, a group of virus writers.

<doc id="20514412" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20514412" title="National Transmission System">
National Transmission System

The National Transmission System (NTS) is the network of gas pipelines throughout the United Kingdom that supply gas to 40 power stations from natural gas terminals situated on the coast, and also gas distribution companies which lead indirectly to homes. 
Similarity to the National Grid.
It is directly analogous to the UK's National Grid for electricity transmission: in fact it is looked after by the same company, National Grid plc, administratively based in Warwick (formerly in Hinckley). Although National Grid only owns the electrical transmission system in England and Wales, with the Scotland transmission system owned by two Scottish companies, the NTS is wholly owned by National Grid plc in England, Scotland and Wales.
History.
North Sea Gas was first brought ashore in the UK in 1967, and from thence the NTS was built by British Gas. Prior to this gas came locally from municipal gasworks. Most of the NTS was built in the 1970s and early 1980s. In February 1997, British Gas de-merged into two units, with the NTS being owned by BG plc, then in October 2000 by the de-merged Lattice Group. In October 2002, the Lattice Group merged with National Grid.
Operation.
The system provides the arteries in the UK's gas network. It is the starting point for gas distribution before it reaches the pipeline system for houses, which is not part of the NTS, but the two systems form the gas distribution network of the UK.
There are two types of gas pipelines in the UK: large diameter high-pressure (up to 85 bar and 120cm diameter) pipelines - the type that the NTS uses, and smaller diameter lower pressure pipelines that connect to domestic uses in residential areas. The NTS has over 6,600km of welded steel gas pipeline with twenty six (mostly gas turbine driven) compressor stations and fifteen pressure regulators. Gas moves through the system at 25 mph. 
Compressor stations include:
Entry.
Gas enters the system via the seven UK gas terminals (six in England and one in Scotland) and the six LNG (three in England, one in Wales and one in Scotland) stores with one terminal in England using LNG carriers connected to LNG piers.
Gas distribution network.
The gas distribution network (to homes) is not part of the NTS. Companies that own part of this gas network, also known as the Local Transmission System (LTS), are known officially as Gas Transporters. Gas to this network enters via the NTS through a pressure reduction station to the twelve gas distribution zones in England, Scotland and Wales within eight distribution networks. In total, there are 275,000km of gas pipelines within this network. The LTS is managed from Hinckley, Leicestershire (former headquarters of the NTS). Financial transactions between the Gas Transporters are managed by Xoserve, based in Solihull. It was formerly an internal department of National Grid and is now an independent company.
For distribution to houses, National Grid plc (this division is based in Northampton) owns the network in North West England, the West Midlands, the East Midlands, the East of England and North London. In June 2005, National Grid sold some gas distribution networks and now in the North of England, it is owned by Northern Gas Networks; in the Wales and West by Wales and West Utilities; and in Southern England and Scotland by Scotia Gas Networks.
Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland is not part of the NTS "per se", but gets its gas via the Scotland to Northern Ireland natural gas transmission pipeline (SNIP) owned by Premier Transmission and built in 1998. The gas network in Northern Ireland is split into two areas with one owned by Phoenix Natural Gas and the other by Firmus Energy.

Danny Boy et ses Pénitents

Danny Boy et ses Pénitents is a French rock'n'roll, twist and beat band of the 1960s whose singer was Danny Boy, real name Claude Piron, born on 25 January 1936 in Saint-Pierre-de-Cormeilles (Eure). The four musicians (Penitents) who accompanied Danny Boy were wearing a balaclava.
Claude Piron can be considered one of the first French rock singers. He began his solo career in 1958 with a successful Kalin Twins cover "When", renamed "Viens". He recorded his first record under his real name, before taking in 1960 the pseudonym of Danny Boy and then formed Danny Boy et ses Pénitents, composed of Bruno (guitar), Ralai (guitar), Didier (bass guitar) and Jose (drums).
Their first hits: "Un collier de tes bras", "Un coup au cœur", "C'est encore une souris", "Je ne veux plus être un dragueur", revealed Piron's tone of voice particularly well hit and plain, which distinguishes it from other singers. Other notable hits: "C'est tout comme", "Danny Boy", "Croque la pomme…".
In 1962, Danny Boy et ses Pénitents toured for eight months with circus Pinder. In 1967, they also toured with Vince Taylor.
Danny Boy is also an actor. He played in a French-Italian film in 1964: "La Difficulté d'être infidèle" ("The difficulty of being unfaithful"), directed by Bernard Toublanc-Michel and nominated to the 14th Berlin International Film Festival for the "Golden Bear".
Danny Boy made his return on stage in 2004 together with the "Vinyls".

Andrée Ruffo is a former Quebec judge named to the Bench in 1987.
She faced numerous disciplinary hearings in the past, to the point where her legal fees, paid by the province, have totaled more than $1 million.
She was reprimanded after one episode in 1997 where she demanded to see the resumes of 125 youth workers she thought weren't qualified to care for children.
In October, 2004 the Quebec Judicial Council noting several ethical shortcomings, recommended her dismissal as a judge. She was accused primarily of having publicly discussed matters she was legally involved with, of having hidden links of friendship with an expert witness who testified before her, and of having lent her name and used the prestige of her position in a 2002 Via Rail television advertisement.
Following this recommendation in conformity with mandatory legal procedure the Quebec Government asked the Quebec Appeal Court to investigate.
In December, 2005, five judges of the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the ruling of the Quebec Judicial Council and recommended Judge Ruffo’s dismissal. Andrée Ruffo asked permission to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.
In May, 2006, the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal, which initiated the formal process of dismissal by the Quebec Attorney General. Madame Ruffo chose to resign before the dismissal was issued.

160-minute solar cycle

The 160-minute solar cycle was an apparent periodic oscillation in the solar surface which was observed in a number of early sets of data collected for helioseismology.
The presence of a 160 minute cycle in the Sun is not substantiated by contemporary solar observations, and the historical signal is considered by main-stream scientists to occur as the redistribution of power from the diurnal cycle as a result of the observation window and atmospheric extinction.
History.
The birth of helioseismology occurred in 1976 with the publications of papers from Brookes, Isaak and van der Raay and Severny, Kotov and Tsap, both of which reported upon the observation of a 160 minute solar oscillation with an amplitude of approximately two metres per second.
It was rapidly realised that this frequency corresponded to one-ninth of a day, and therefore the authenticity of this signal was in some doubt. If a non-sinusoidal oscillation is present in a time-series then power will be seen in a periodogram at not only the frequency of the oscillation, but also harmonics at integer multiples of this frequency. A re-analysis of data obtained over the period of 1974–1976 by Brookes et al. showed that the evidence for a stable, phase-coherent 160 minute oscillation at a constant amplitude was far from conclusive. Although the signal could be detected the amplitude appeared variable and was lower than first reported.
A re-affirmation of the 160 minute signal was obtained by analysis of data from groups in Crimea and Stanford over a long period of time. It was found that the phase showed a steady drift, indicative that the frequency being used in analysis differed slightly from that in the data. This implied that a period of 160.01 minutes produced a better fit to the data. Evidence also emerged that multiple sets of observations were phase-coherent. These facts contributed to impressions that the origin of the observed signal was stellar and not terrestrial in origin.
In 1989 as higher-quality multiple-year datasets from a single site became available it was shown by Elsworth et al. that the period of the 160 minute signal was indeed 160.00 minutes, and the amplitude was dependent upon both the length and quality of data obtained in a season, with the signal more prominent at time where atmospheric condition were worse. The group were able to demonstrate that the signal may be simulated by a slightly distorted diurnal sine-wave such as may be obtained by differential atmospheric extinction.
Although claims of the presence of a 160 minute period in the Sun were still presented by Kotov et al. in 1990, and 1991, the mainstream scientific establishment had moved on.
Contemporary Observations.
There are currently two solar-observation networks, the BiSON and GONG networks which consist of a global network of stations, as well as space based instruments such as the GOLF instrument aboard the SOHO spacecraft. These are able keep the Sun under near-continuous observation, and so largely eliminate the influence of diurnal signals. Data from these instruments show no oscillation at 160 minutes.

Satake diagram

In the mathematical study of Lie algebras and Lie groups, a Satake diagram is a generalization of a Dynkin diagram introduced by whose configurations classify simple Lie algebras over the field of real numbers. The Satake diagrams associated to a Dynkin diagram classify real forms of the complex Lie algebra corresponding to the Dynkin diagram.
More generally, the Tits index or Satake–Tits diagram of a reductive algebraic group over a field is a generalization of the Satake diagram to arbitrary fields, introduced by , that reduces the classification of reductive algebraic groups to that of anisotropic reductive algebraic groups. 
Satake diagrams are not the same as Vogan diagrams of a Lie group, although they look similar.
Definition.
A Satake diagram is obtained from a Dynkin diagram by blackening some vertices, and connecting other vertices in pairs by arrows, according to certain rules. 
Suppose that "G" is an algebraic group defined over a field "k", such as the reals. We let "S" be a maximal split torus in "G", and take "T" to be a maximal torus containing "S" defined over the separable algebraic closure "K" of "k". Then "G"("K") has a Dynkin diagram with respect to some choice of positive roots of "T". This Dynkin diagram has a natural action of the Galois group of "K"/"k". Also some of the simple roots vanish on "S". The Satake–Tits diagram is given by the Dynkin diagram "D", together with the action of the Galois group, with the simple roots vanishing on "S" colored black. In the case when "k" is the field of real numbers, the absolute Galois group has order 2, and its action on "D" is represented by drawing conjugate points of the Dynkin diagram near each other, and the Satake–Tits diagram is called a Satake diagram.

The Lost Album is the sixth and final (to date, excluding rereleases) album by the British neo-soul composer and multi-instrumentalist Lewis Taylor, released in 2005.
Taylor recorded this album in the late 1990s, in reaction to British press naming him "new British blue-eyed soulster", and cites Fleetwood Mac and Beach Boys as his main influences. He intended it to be released as a follow-up to his 1996 self-titled debut, but Island Records rejected it, after which he returned with the album Lewis II. The Lost Album was finally released in 2005 through Taylor's own label Slow Reality.

Virtual sensor network

Virtual sensor networks (VSNs) is an emerging form of collaborative wireless sensor networks. In contrast to early wireless sensor networks that were dedicated to a specific application (e.g., target tracking), VSNs enable multi-purpose, collaborative, and resource efficient WSNs. The key idea difference of VSNs is the collaboration and resource sharing. By doing so nodes achieve application objectives in a more resource efficient way. These networks may further involve dynamically varying subset of sensor nodes (e.g., when the phenomenon migrates sensors that detect the phenomenon changes with time) and/or users (users that are accessing the network changes with time).
A VSN can be formed by providing logical connectivity among collaborative sensors. Nodes can be grouped into different VSNs based on the phenomenon they track (e.g., rock slides vs. animal crossing) or the task they perform. VSNs are expected to provide the protocol support for formation, usage, adaptation, and maintenance of subset of sensors collaborating on a specific task(s). Even the nodes that do not sense the particular event/phenomenon could be part of a VSN as far as they are willing to allow sensing nodes to communicate through them. Thus, VSNs make use of intermediate nodes, networks, or other VSNs to efficiently deliver messages across members of a VSN.
Applications.
VSNs are useful in three major classes of applications:

Soldiers and Sailors Monument (Lancaster, Pennsylvania)

The Soldiers and Sailors Monument is a tall Gothic Revival memorial which stands in Penn Square in downtown Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It was dedicated on July 4, 1874, at its present site on the Northeast intersection of King and Queen Streets. The monument's original intention was to pay tribute to Lancastrian Union soldiers killed during the American Civil War. However, today the Soldiers and Sailors Monument also represents those who have served in subsequent American military conflicts.
The 1744 Treaty of Lancaster between the British and Iroquois was signed in the old Lancaster courthouse which stood on the site of the monument at the time.
The Soldiers and Sailors Monument also stands on the exact spot where the Second Continental Congress met during the American Revolutionary War on September 27, 1777, in the old Lancaster Courthouse. The courthouse later burned down in 1784. The monument has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since April 2, 1973.
Description.
The Lancaster Soldiers and Sailors Monument features a tall Rhode Island, rectangular granite pillar topped with a statue of a robed woman on a pedestal known as the "The Genius of Liberty". The Genius of Liberty holds a drawn sword and a shield. Her head is crowned with stars. She faces north which, according to legend, allows her to turn her back on the former Confederate States of America, which were defeated in the war.
Statues of four men representing the four branches of the American armed services surround the granite shaft near its base. The four branches represented by the men are the United States Navy, United States Army, Artillery and the United States Cavalry.
The names of several Civil War battles are carved on the monument's central granite pillar, as the memorial's original intent was to honor those killed in that particular war. The inscriptions include the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Chickamauga, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of Malvern Hill, the Battle of Petersburg and the Battle of the Wilderness.
Several bronze plaques have been added to the Soldiers and Sailors Monument since its construction, memorializing members of the American armed forces. One plaque specifically commemorates the role of African Americans in the military. Other separate plaques honor those killed in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War and the Persian Gulf War.
The base of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument is carved with the inscription, "Erected by the people of Lancaster County/ To the memory of their fellow citizens who fell /in defense of the Union /in the War of the Rebellion /1861–1865"
History.
The idea for a memorial to Lancasterian Union soldiers killed during the American Civil War was conceived soon after the end of hostilities in 1865. The funding for the memorial was championed by a women's civic organization called the Patriot Daughters of Lancaster and its leader, Rosina Hubley. The Patriot Daughters of Lancaster held a ladies fundraising fair sale in December 1867 at the nearby Fulton Hall, now called the Fulton Opera House, to help finance the construction of the proposed monument. The event raised approximately US$3,500 the ultimate goal of $20,000. The remaining funds for the monument's construction were raised through either military taxes and funds released by the Lancaster County Treasury or through private donations. The total cost of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument is believed to be $26,000 at the time.
Centre Square, as the present-day Penn Square was called at the time, was chosen as the site of the new Soldiers and Sailors Monument. The monument was formally commissioned on November 4, 1872. It was formally unveiled and dedicated on July 4, 1874, and was originally surrounded by stockade fencing and dirt streets at the time. President Ulysses S. Grant sent his regrets for being unable to attend the ceremony. The large crowd which watched the dedication included Civil War veterans and a group of girls from the Mount Joy Soldiers Orphan Home. The Soldiers and Sailors Monument was officially dedicated at 1:00 pm while the girls from the orphanage sang "My Father's Grave". The Genius of Liberty on top of the monument was drapped in an American flag.
Rosina Hubley, who had led the efforts to construct the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, remarked on July 4, 1874, that she believed it would be a "perpetual reminder to all people of the country as they gather week-to-week to barter and chaffer in the market place, that there is something higher and better than self or produce, bargains or bank notes."
An iron fence and granite wall enclosure were added to the monument in 1877, replacing the original picket fence. The monument was sandblasted and cleaned in both 1905 and 1924. A plaque containing the Gettysburg Address and a picture of Abraham Lincoln were added on June 8, 1931. New lights were placed on the monument in 1956, 1972 and again in the early 2000s.
A proposal was floated during the 1950s to relocate the monument to an alternative site in a city park in order to ease traffic congestion in downtown Lancaster. However, the relocation idea was abandoned and the memorial remained at its original location. 
Traffic passed around all four sides of the monument until the 1970s. A new traffic pattern was devised for Penn Square and the monument in 1972. A brick plaza was constructed in tandem with the expansion of the nearby Fulton Bank building, closing off traffic on the monument's northeast corner and opening it to pedestrians. The size of the monument's base was shrunk from its original down to as part of the reroute of traffic. The iron railing, added in 1877, was removed and new granite curbing was added to protect the monument from traffic collisions.
On November 12, 1978, a woman committed suicide by crashing her car into the monument, causing damage to the sailor statue, which represents the United States Navy. The sailor statue's base and legs were repaired using cement.
The new $170 million, Lancaster County Convention Center and 300 room Marriott Hotel opened directly across the street from the monument on April 21, 2009. The historic Lancaster Central Market, constructed in 1889, and the W. W. Griest Building stand just to the northwest.

Kimberly Shaw

Dr. Kimberly Shaw (previously Mancini) is a character from the hit television series "Melrose Place". She was portrayed by Emmy-nominated actress Marcia Cross for the first five seasons from 1992 to 1997.
Casting.
After her stint on "Knots Landing", actress Marcia Cross landed the recurring role of Kimberly Shaw on "Melrose Place". Only planned as a small part in the beginning, the character of Kimberly came more recognizable once the role was believed to have died in a car accident and shocked viewers with her return. Cross became a fan favorite but refused for the longest time to sign a contract with the show. The producers finally convinced her to go on contract with the start of the fourth season in September 1995. Cross left one and a half year later, when producers refused to give her a pay raise that would bring her near the salary of co-star Heather Locklear. She last appeared in April 1997 with the character being killed off. Only one month later, co-star Laura Leighton left for the same reason as Cross.
Storylines.
Season 1.
Kimberly first appears in the first season as a Resident Doctor at Wilshire Memorial, as a colleague of Michael Mancini; the two characters are only interns at this point. She is considered one of the top new doctors there on the fast track to a bright future. Initially, she helps Michael with whatever problems he has going on, such as marital or personal problems as a doctor. The two become friends, and she accompanies Michael to the Melrose Place Christmas party where she first meets the other residents. Later on, Alison moves out of her apartment, and Billy needs a new roommate. Michael suggests Kimberly and so she goes to look at the apartment. However, noticing Billy and Alison's issues, she decides that she does not want a roommate as it means getting involved in people's day to day lives. Kimberly soon notices herself having feelings for Michael and soon learns that he feels the same way. They begin to have an affair. Soon, they are caught out by Alison. Michael's wife, Jane, eventually also finds out and confronts Michael. He denies it but the two are then caught red handed by Jane herself. Michael agrees to stop seeing Kimberly to save his marriage but cannot deny his feelings for her. Kimberly initially also tries to end the affair as she thinks it is morally wrong but she too cannot deny her feelings. Confronted by Jane, Kimberly reveals the affair is not over and so Jane files for divorce.
Season 2.
Kimberly and Michael move in together after she finds a beach house to rent. They are very happy together at first, but Jane's sister, Sydney, soon causes trouble as she makes her intentions for Michael very clear. She eventually seduces a drunken Michael. Michael tells Sydney that it was a mistake but falls prey to her advances once more and is caught by Kimberly. Michael apologizes and begs Kimberly to forgive him. She refuses and tries to go on without him. Eventually, he convinces her to go on a date, during which he proposes marriage. She rejects his proposal initially but changes her mind on the way home. They celebrate with a kiss but a drunken Michael loses control of the car and they suffer a terrible car accident. Kimberly slips into a coma, while a grief-stricken Michael is paralyzed from the waist down. Kimberly's mother, Marion Shaw (Janet Carroll) comes to take Kimberly back to Cleveland, Ohio to be near her family after making it clear that she blames Michael for the whole ordeal and for destroying Kimberly's life. Several weeks later, she informs the Wilshire staff that Kimberly has died. It turns out that Michael had Matt change his blood alcohol level reports after the accident to avoid jail time. Sydney soon discovers this and eventually blackmails Michael into marriage. Weeks later, Michael caves and decides to make the most of his life with Sydney, accepting defeat. While kissing on the beach house balcony, they are obviously being watched. It is soon discovered that Kimberly is watching them. The next night, Michael awakens in the middle of a storm and checks out a noise in the kitchen. He is startled to see Kimberly. She reveals that she was in a coma for months and that her mother lied to the hospital to keep Michael from her. Michael explains his unique situation with Sydney but Kimberly says that she will take care of things. Kimberly appears different upon her return: stronger, angrier and determined. As Michael is no longer under threat of being charged with homicide, he divorces Sydney and plans to marry Kimberly once again. Kimberly soon reveals that she plans to get revenge on him for what he has done to her. In the bathroom one night, she reveals a huge nasty scar underneath a wig she now wears, resulting in awful migraines. Kimberly lets Sydney in on her plan to kill Michael and they plot together on how to achieve this. After one failed attempt, Kimberly steals Jane's car and disguises herself as Jane and runs Michael down.
Season 3.
Michael survives again and suffers amnesia. Jane is arrested but soon cleared and the evidence points to Sydney. Kimberly uses this to her advantage and frames Sydney. Sydney is arrested and charged with attempted murder. Matt begins to suspect Kimberly of the crime and Sydney informs everyone of this but Kimberly is cleared. Michael gets his memory back and realises Kimberly tried to kill him. He gives her an ultimatum "either love me or kill me but make up your damn mind". She decides she loves him too much and the two begin to live their life as normal again. After a trip to Las Vegas, they elope but Kimberly then learns she is barren as a result of the accident. They try to adopt but the cost and time is too much for Kimberly. After hearing of Jo's issues with her own pregnancy, Kimberly offers her a solution...fake the death of Jo's baby so that she can move to New York and raise the child herself rather than give it up the to the Carters as a judge had ordered. Kimberly delivers the baby then fills out the paper work to make it appear that Jo's child was still born. Jo stays in hospital to go along with the story. Kimberly goes home and attempts to breast feed the child. When Jo comes to collect her son, Kimberly, nursing the baby, tells her it was still born and closes the door. Jo connot contact the police as she was committing a crime in her attempt to keep her child.
After many attempts to get her child back, Jo finally does so after informing Wilshires Chief of Staff, Peter Burns (Jack Wagner) of the incident. Peter tells Michael to return the child or he and Kimberly will be fired. While Kimberly is at work on Christmas Day, Michael returns the baby to Jo. An enraged Kimberly tries to drown herself in the ocean but Michael saves her. Kimberly informs the Carters of their grandsons well being in an effort to get pay back at Jo. Kimberly goes back to her plans of legally adopting a child but her obsession with having a baby drives Michael away and he begins a romance with cancer stricken Amanda. Kimberly's attempts to end this by threatening both Amanda and Michael appear to work but Michael continues to see Amanda. He finds Kimberly in tears at home where she tells him she knows all his faults and she is the only person that will let him be true to himself. All she asks is that he does not leave her. Michael assures Kimberly he never will. The doctors at Wilshire must undergo a psych evaluation where it is revealed that Kimberly is a ticking time bomb, with no threshold for dealing with stress.
To prevent this from going public, she has Matt attacked so that she can change her results, more suitable to her liking. Michael tells Kimberly he wants them to move away from all their problems in Los Angeles and so he sends Kimberly off to San Diego to look at some houses. While gone, he keeps Amanda in their home. Kimberly arrives home early to discover this. At the hospital, Kimberly receives a check for $100,000 from the council after Michael filed a claim citing the dangerous roads as the cause for his accident with Kimberly more than a year ago. She informs Michael that she has received the money and will put it in their joint account. Kimberly is then stunned when presented with divorce papers at work. She confronts Michael and he reveals that he plans to take the money and be with Amanda. Kimberly goes home that night and leaves Michael a suicide note and takes a handful of pills. Michael finds her and dials 911 but soon hangs up as Kimberlys death will work out well for him. However Sydney arrives, forcing Michael to make the call. While there she finds the suicide note and takes it. Kimberly tells Sydney that she will pay Sydney $50,000 to swap some pills to make it look like Michael tried to kill her and find the suicide note. Sydney agrees but Michael then pays her another $50,000 for the suicide note. Michael tells Kimberly he will show it to the medical board unless she leaves the city. Kimberly agrees but informs Sydney that she will pay for her deception. Kimberly attends camp "No More Victims", a popular camp for abused women to find inner and outer strength. Whilst there, she hallucinates Jane, Sydney, Amanda and Jo taunting her for her crimes against them all.
Kimberly realises what she must now do to seek revenge on her enemies. She receives an early graduation after breaking the arm of the sergeant in charge of the camp. She returns to work and Michael goes through with his threat and informs the chief of staff of her suicide note. The chief of staff feels that Michael is doing it for his own pleasure rather than protecting the hospital and he tells them to behave professionally at work. Kimberly informs Amanda that she wants to form a truce against Michael (as Amanda feels Michael has begun harassing her). Amanda agrees and so Kimberly begins terrorizing Amanda, making her think it is Michael. Kimberly goes to the beach house, tares it apart and injures herself and calls the police. It appears to them that he has attacked her and he is arrested. Kimberly goes home one night but soon sees the reflection of a demonic man in the mirror. She collapses telling herself she isn't crazy. Michael is released on bail, put up by Peter. Michael has Sydney follow Kimberly but Sydney believes Kimberly has changed and is not up to any trouble until Sydney finds a collage of photos of herself, Michael, Matt and Amanda with eyes cut out and blood smeared all over them at Kimberly's motel room. The police can do nothing though. Kimberly asks Peter why he bailed Michael out of jail and he then asks her on a date. They have several dates including one at a hospital function. Kimberly sees the demonic image again and he tells her to destroy her enemies.
Sydney overhears Kimberly say she will kill them all. Kimberly then realises Peter still has feelings for Amanda. This is the final straw for Kimberly, as she loses someone she cares about to Amanda once again. Kimberly decides to blow up Melrose Place with all her enemies inside. Sydney tries to stop her but Kimberly catches her. That night, everyone arrives at Melrose Place apart from Matt. Michael and Sydney manage to knock Kimberly out and attempt to clear the building but Kimberly regains consciousness and tells everyone that "it's not what it looks like...it's worse".
Season 4.

Kimberly is taken to the psychiatric ward of the hospital under tough surveillance. With Peter as her doctor, she remembers nothing of the past week, refusing to believe she could do something so horrible. She manages to escape her room and attempts to jump off the roof of the hospital, saying she has nothing to live for. Peter tells her he cares about her and convinces her to come down. He then tells her she must plead insanity to avoid a life sentence. She refuses but soon agrees to fake an insanity test as with treatment she will likely be released. She fails the insanity test to their dismay. However, at a court hearing, Michael and Sydney arrive and Kimberly sees Henry again, her demonic reflection and he tells her to destroy them once and for all. She lunges at Michael and Sydney but is taken off to her cell. The judge then declares her insane.
Peter initially thinks it is good acting until he realises she really is insane. Kimberly reveals her visions of Henry to Peter and he decides to call Marion Shaw to see if she knows anything. Marion comes to Los Angeles with plans to take Kimberly back to Cleveland once again but soon confesses she knows who Henry is. When Kimberly was 7, her father was away on business. Marion was in the kitchen making a cake for Kimberlys birthday. Henry, their gardner, came in and soon began to rape Marion. Kimberly saw this, picked up a knife and killed Henry. With this breakthrough, Kimberly receives treatment and is soon let out into Peter's custody. She is given a monitoring belt, ensuring she is only at Peter's or the mental institution. She is allowed go the Melrose Place post bomb party to apologize to everyone and go into the laundry room, where she planted much of her bombs.

Peter says she will be re-institutionalized if she continues to claim that Henry is haunting her.
Kimberly soon discovers that "Henry" is real and Michael and Sydney's plan to drive her back to insanity. With this, Kimberly feels she is cured. She tells Peter she wants her monitoring device gone but he has trouble getting it approved. Kimberly breaks her wrist to remove it so she can begin work as radio host. Eventually the device is legally removed and Kimberly moves into Melrose Place. Feeling lonely, Kimberly begins a string of one night stands. An obsessed radio fan soon harasses Kimberly and kidnaps her but she breaks free and takes him to the police where he is jailed. Kimberly decides to go back to work at Wilshire where she begins work as a Psychiatrist. Sydney becomes a patient of hers, where she regularly discusses Michael. Kimberly helps Sydney with her relationship with Michael though he still believes she is insane and wants to kill him. She soon begins flirting with him and eventually Michael softens to her, believing she has changed. They become friends again and hint at getting back together.
She goes to him for an injection one day but he injects her with truth serum to find out a secret of Sydney's. He also asks if she wants to kill him and she says no, she loves him. When fully conscience again, Kimberly tells Michael he has ruined any trust she had restored in him and wants nothing to do with him. Kimberly kidnapper, Vic, escapes from jail and takes her hostage once more. Michael manages to save her however and her trust in him is restored. Michael then asks her to move back into the beach house with him, confessing his love for her. Kimberly says they are bad for each other but agrees. Kimberly then receives divorce papers as the two never finalized their divorce originally. She sees it as a sign but Michael rips it up, asking her to marry him again. They renew their vows in front of their Melrose Place friends on the beach. Blissfully happy once again, upon their return from their honeymoon, Kimberly has flashbacks of the car accident.
She awakens once day to see a pile of ironing done that she doesn't recall doing. Days later she is at a tupperware party, wearing wholesome clothing and calling herself Betsy. After Kimberly and Michael have sex on the sofa, "Betsy" tosses it onto the beach and sets it alight. Kimberly realizes she has a multiple personality disorder. Afraid to tell Michael for fear he will leave her, Kimberly also has reservations telling Peter as she doesn't want to go back to the mental institution. She develops another identity, Rita. As things get out of control, Kimberly confides her secret to Peter. He agrees to help her but before he can, "Betsy" takes over and kidnaps Peter. Betsy does not want Peter to destroy her so she takes him to a mental institution out of town that Betsy had recently been put in charge of, an arrangement made up through Kimberlys connections as a doctor. Betsy sees this as pay back for Peter having Kimberly in an institution months earlier. She attempts to lobotomize him. Before she can, Amanda and Michael arrive looking for Peter and Kimberly. Betsy has them locked up with Peter, revealing they will all have lobotomies. Michael tries to talk to Kimberly, telling her they have gone through too much to be together and that he loves her.
Kimberly manages to break through Betsy with this but an orderly believes Michael has brainwashed Betsy. He struggles with Michael and Kimberly intervenes, resulting in her tumbling over the railing, unconscious. At Wilshire, she is in a coma and flatlines.
Season 5.
She stabilizes but is still in a coma. Peter is accused of murder. Kimberly is his only alibi as she was with him the night of the murder, when she told him of her mental issues. Kimberly comes to but is unable to recall her dinner with Peter. Amanda threatens to kill her if she doesn't come through for Peter. Kimberly runs away because she is afraid she can't help Peter. She returns and goes to court and says she does not remember her dinner with Peter but she does remember a waiter there who can vouch for Peter. Peter is cleared. Kimberly faces the medical board based on her/Betsy running the mental institution. Kimberly states it is obvious she is unfit to practice medicine and decides it is best she gives up her medical license. Kimberly then goes to work for Peter and Michael as their receptionist till they find a replacement. Kimberly tells Michael she has gone off sex and suggests other ways for them to be intimate.
Michael is disappointed but goes along with this for Kimberly. As the weeks pass, he becomes frustrated and meets a beautiful woman, Megan on the beach. She offers him no strings attached sex and he goes to her home but then declines as he loves Kimberly too much. Eventually he can't resist though. Kimberly learns from her doctor that she has a brain tumor and is given three months to live. She decides not to tell Michael as he could not bare to hear the news and she fears he could not live without her. Soon enough, it is revealed that Kimberly and Megan are friends. Kimberly tells Megan she is dying and wants her to be with Michael after she dies. Kimberly decides that rather than tell Michael of her tumor, she will drive him away and into Megans arms so that he will have someone after Kimberly is gone.
Kimberly had originally hired Megan, a prostitute, to service Michael until her sex drive returned. Megan wants to tell Michael but Kimberly refuses. Instead, she "catches" him cheating and states she wants a divorce. They finalize the divorce and Kimberly convinces Megan to marry Michael. Kimberly wants to leave Michael with life insurance money but can't get any as she is so close to death. She decides to commit suicide, disguising it as an accident so she can leave him with accidental death money. She tells Megan this but Megan tries to stop her. In order to do this, Megan tells Michael of Kimberly's tumor and all her plans. They manage to stop Kimberly but Michael is devastated to learn she is dying. Michael tells Peter he feels responsible because of the car accident three years earlier. He refuses to leave Kimberly in her final weeks. Kimberly finally accepts and decides to make the most of her time with Michael.
Megan begins to feel neglected as Michael spends all his time with Kimberly. Kimberly asks Michael for one last night together and they have sex. Megan discovers this and tries to run Kimberly down but she can't. Kimberly learns her tumor is in remission and she believes it is because of Michaels love and care for her. As a result, she tries to break up Michael and Megan to get Michael back for good. She does not tell Michael of her remission, but when he discovers it, he feels betrayed and says he wants nothing to do with her. Kimberly collapses and it is revealed that she has an aneurysm and surgery will likely result in paralysis. Kimberly says she is done fighting and wants to go peacefully. Megan hires a full-time nurse for Kimberly but Michael believes Kimberly is faking it to get him back.
He goes to the beach house and is shocked to see Kimberly barely hanging to life. He calls Marion and tells her to come to Los Angeles at once. Marion once again decides to take Kimberly back to Ohio. Michael says it is too dangerous to move her and accuses Marion of endangering Kimberlys life because she hates him. Marion admits she hates Michael because she feels Michael made Kimberly ill, but she intends to make Kimberly better. Kimberly has Michael and Megan over for a goodbye dinner but a fight between Marion and Michael prevents a goodbye. The next day, Marion is out and so Kimberly asks Megan to come pick her up so she can say goodbye to Michel.
Kimberly says she has always loved Michael needs to tell him so. However, Marion arrives and tells Megan off for moving Kimberly. Kimberly protests, insisting she must see Michael. However, she collapses and dies in her mother's arms. Megan informs Michael of Kimberly's death. Michael says he does not feel guilty and they must all go one with their lives. That night, he goes to the train station and finds Marion having Kimberly's coffin loaded onto the train. He tells her he cared very deeply for Kimberly and never meant to hurt her. She gives Michael a moment alone. The coffin is opened and Michael says goodbye, telling Kimberly he has always loved her and will never forget her. He kisses her. The train takes off and Michael breaks out in tears, the love of his life now gone forever.
After Life.
After Kimberly's death, Michael and Megan discover Kimberly left the beach house to them. Megan feels uncomfortable moving into the house Michael and Kimberly shared but he convinces her to. Megan has a dream in which she sees Kimberly. Kimberly tells Megan she must be careful that Michael does not let his ambition destroy her like it has all his other wives. She gives Megan advice on what would make Michael happy and then reveals there is a possibility she will be Megan's guardian angel. With that, Kimberly is never seen again.
Several months after her death, Brett "Coop" Cooper visits Kimberlys grave, stating he will get revenge on Michael for what he did to Kimberly. Coop begins work at Wilshire. It is soon revealed that years ago, while Kimberly was in a coma in Ohio and while Michael thought she was dead, Coop fell in love with Kimberly. When she awoke, the two formed a romance until Kimberly returned to Los Angeles to get revenge on Michael. Coop considers Kimberly the love of his life. Marion soon follows Coop to Los Angeles to help get revenge on Michael. Unaware of any of this at this stage, Michael finds Kimberly's lab-coat in place of his own, Kimberly's wedding dress arrives at his door and he finds her storage room has been emptied with nothing but a photo of Michael and Kimberly, smashed on the ground. Michael then sees a woman's shadow at the beach house and she tries to shoot him. Michael is convinced Kimberly is still alive. Though Megan scoffs at this, Michael reminds Megan that Kimberly has done it before. It is soon revealed that Marion is responsible for all this. Michael tells her he is sorry for all the harm he caused Kimberly but that he truly did love her. She goes back home to seek mental help. Months later, Coop still blames Michael for Kimberly's death and leaves Los Angeles.
In the final episode of the series, in the final scene, Peter and Amanda discuss having children. Peter says they will have a Billy and an Alison, a Sydney, etc. Amanda says "Just promise me there will be no Kimberlys". Peter promises.

Walter Baldwin

Walter Baldwin (January 2, 1889 − January 27, 1977) was a prolific character actor whose career spanned five decades and 150 film and television roles, and numerous stage performances.
Baldwin, who was born Walter S. Baldwin Jr. in Lima, Ohio from a theatrical family, served in the First World War.
He was probably best known for playing the father of the handicapped sailor in "The Best Years of Our Lives". He was the first actor to portray "Floyd the Barber" on "The Andy Griffith Show.
Prior to his first film roles in 1939, Baldwin had appeared in more than a dozen Broadway plays. He played Whit in the first Broadway production of "Of Mice and Men", and also appeared in the original "Grand Hotel" in a small role, as well as serving as the production's stage manager. He originated the role of Bensinger, the prissy Chicago Tribune reporter, in the Broadway production of "The Front Page".
In the 1960s he had small acting roles in television shows such as "Petticoat Junction" and "Green Acres". He continued to act in motion pictures, and one of his last roles was in "Rosemary's Baby".
Baldwin was known for playing solid middle class burghers, although sometimes he gave portrayals of eccentric characters. He played a customer seeking a prostitute in "The Lost Weekend" and the rebellious prison trusty Orvy in "Cry of the City". Walter Baldwin was featured in a lot of John Deere Day Movies from 1949-59 where he played the farmer Tom Gordon. In this series of Deere Day movies over a decade he helped to introduce many new pieces of John Deere farm equipment year-by-year. In each yearly movie he would be shown on his in A Tom Gordon Family Film where he would be buying new John Deere farm equipment or a new green and yellow tractor.A picture of Walter Baldwin playing Tom Gordon can be found on page 108 of Bob Pripp's book John Deere Yesterday & Today
Hal Erickson writes in Allmovie: "With a pinched Midwestern countenance that enabled him to portray taciturn farmers, obsequious grocery store clerks and the occasional sniveling coward, Baldwin was a familiar (if often unbilled) presence in Hollywood films for three decades."

3. deild karla

3. deild karla (e. Men's Third division) is a football league in Iceland. It is the fourth level, and second-lowest division, in the Icelandic football league system. Current champions are Fjarðabyggð. The league was reformed into a 10-team double round-robin tournament for the 2013 season, with the introduction of the newly established 5th level of the Icelandic football league system, 4. deild karla.
Previous formats.
Ever since 1982, the first season of the 3. deild (then named 4. deild), and throughout the 2012 season, the 3. deild had been the lowest division in the league system and as a consequence didn't have a fixed amount of teams. All who wished to enter and could fill certain requirements were allowed to compete, and between each season some teams quit and some new teams came in, sometimes after having previously quit. There were various formats used in the 31 seasons the 3. deild was the lowest league, the latest version using group stages and then eight-team playoffs to decide two promoted teams.
Current format.
As of 2013, the 3. deild will be a nationwide league of 10 teams, with each team playing each other once home and once away for a total of 18 games per team. The two highest placed teams are promoted to 2. deild karla while the two lowest teams are relegated to 4. deild karla.
2013 season.
In 2013 the league will consist of the two teams relegated from 2. deild karla the year before, the six teams that reached the playoffs in the previous 3. deild but did not gain promotion to 2. deild, and two teams who were decided in a playoff between the four clubs in 3rd place in their groups. 
Past winners.
Promoted teams shown in green
1 - Njarðvík promoted due to the merger of the 1. deild clubs Leiftur and Dalvík.<br>
2 - ÍH promoted due to expansion of 1. deild karla to 12 teams.<br>
3 - Tindastóll also promoted due to expansion of Úrvalsdeild karla and 2. deild karla to 12 teams.<br>
4 - Upon promotion Hamrarnir/Vinir merged with the relegated ÍH to form ÍH/HV<br>
5 - Árborg promoted as Tindastóll merged with 2. deild karla side Hvöt, creating a new team called Tindastóll/Hvöt, playing in the 2. deild karla.<br>
6 - Teams that finished in 3rd-10th place (Leiknir F, Magni, Huginn, Kári, ÍH, Víðir, Augnablik and Grundarfjörður) were the only teams remaining for the 2013 season, a ten-team league consisting of those 8 teams plus Fjarðabyggð and KFR who came down from 2. deild karla. The remaining teams joined a new lowest division that launched in 2013.

Basque Country (autonomous community)

The Basque Country (, ; ; ; ) is an autonomous community of northern Spain. It includes the Basque provinces of Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa, also called Historical Territories.
The Basque Country or Basque Autonomous Community was granted the status of "nationality" within Spain, attributed by the Spanish Constitution of 1978. The autonomous community is based on the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, a foundational legal document providing the framework for the development of the Basque people on Spanish soil. Notwithstanding this spirit, the territory of Navarre was left out and made into a separate autonomous community. The capital is Vitoria-Gasteiz ("Vitoria" is the name in Spanish, "Gasteiz" in Basque), located in the province of Álava, and Bilbao its largest city, located in the province of Biscay.
The legal jurisdiction of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country should not be confused with the cultural larger Basque Country (Basque: "Euskal Herria"), the name given to the home of the Basque people, of which it is a component part.
Geography.
The following provinces make up the autonomous community:
Features.
The Basque Country borders with Cantabria and the Burgos province to the west, the Bay of Biscay to the north, France and Navarre to the east and La Rioja (the Ebro River) to the south.
The territory has three distinct areas, that are defined by the two parallel ranges of the Basque Mountains. The main range of mountains forms the water divide of the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. The highest point of the range is in the Aizkorri massif (1551 m). The three areas are:
The Atlantic Basin.
Formed by many valleys with short rivers that flow from the mountains to the Bay of Biscay, like the Nervión, Urola or Oria.
The coast is rough, with high cliffs and small inlets. The main features of the coast are the Bilbao Abra Bay and the Estuary of Bilbao, the Urdaibai estuary and the Bidasoa-Txingudi Bay that forms the border with France.
The middle section.
Between the two mountain ranges, the area is occupied mainly by a high plateau called "Llanada Alavesa" (Álava plains) where the capital Gasteiz is located. The rivers flow in southern direction from the mountains to the Ebro river. Main rivers are Zadorra and Bayas river.
The Ebro Valley.
From the southern mountains to the Ebro is the so-called "Rioja Alavesa", that shares the Mediterranean characteristics of other Ebro Valley zones, here is produced part of the Rioja wine.
Climate.
The Basque mountains form the water divide and mark also the distinct climatic areas of the Basque Country:
The northern valleys, in Biscay and Gipuzkoa and also the valley of Ayala in Álava, are part of the Green Spain, where oceanic climate is predominant, with its wet weather all year round and moderate temperatures. Precipitation average is about 1200 mm.
The middle section has a greater influence of a Continental climate, but with a varying degree of the northern oceanic one, this causes dry and warm summers and cold and snowy winters.
The Ebro valley has a pure Continental climate, winters are cold and dry and summers very warm and dry, with precipitation peaking in spring and autumn. Precipitation is scarce and irregular, as low as 300 mm.
Demography.
Almost half of the 2,155,546 inhabitants of the Basque Country live in Greater Bilbao, Bilbao's metropolitan area. Of the ten most populous cities, six form part of Bilbao's conurbation (Bilbao, Barakaldo, Getxo, Portugalete, Santurtzi and Basauri), which is also known as Greater Bilbao.
At 28.2% of the Basque population born outside this region, immigration is crucial to Basque demographics. Over the 20th century most of this immigration came from other parts of Spain, typically from Galicia or Castile and León. Over the last years, sizeable numbers of this population have returned to their birthplaces whereas immigration to the Basque country currently originates abroad, chiefly from South America.
Languages.
Spanish and Basque are co-official in all territories of the autonomous community. The Basque-speaking areas in the modern-day autonomous community are set against the wider context of the Basque language, spoken to the east in Navarre and the French Basque Country. The whole Basque speaking territory has experienced both decline and expansion in its history. Basque language experienced a gradual territorial contraction throughout the last nine centuries, and very severe deterioration of its sociolinguistic status for much of the 20th century due to heavy immigration from other parts of Spain, the virtual nonexistence of Basque language schooling, and the national policies implemented by the different Spanish régimes (see Language policies of Francoist Spain). After the advent of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country in 1982 following Franco's death, this reductive trend was gradually reversed thanks to the Basque language schools and the new education system. Basque has always had a strong presence in most of Gipuzkoa, central and eastern Biscay and the northern edge of Álava, while most Basque speakers in western Biscay and the rest of Álava are second-language speakers.
The 2006 sociolinguistic survey of all Basque provinces showed that in 2006 of all people aged 16 and above in the Basque Autonomous Community, 30.1% were fluent Basque speakers, 18.3% passive speakers and 51.5% did not speak Basque. The percentage was highest in Gipuzkoa (49.1% speakers) and lowest in Álava (14.2%). These results represent an increase on previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The highest percentage of speakers can now be found in the 16-24 age range (57.5%) vs 25.0% in the 65+ age range.
History.
The forerunner of the Gernika Statute was the short-lived Statute of Autonomy for Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay enforced in October 1936 just in Biscay with the Spanish Civil War already raging and automatically abolished when the Spanish Nationalist troops occupied the territory.
Before the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and its system of autonomous communities, these three provinces were known in Spanish as the "Provincias Vascongadas" since 1833. The political structure of the new autonomous community is defined in the Gernika Statute, which was approved by a majority in a referendum held on 25 October 1979. Nowadays it is one of the most decentralized regions in the world, in this regard it has been quoted as having ""more autonomy than just about any other in Europe"" by "The Economist".
As regards the bounds to the Spanish Constitution, Basque nationalists cite the fact that in the 1978 Spanish Constitution referendum, which was passed with a majority of votes and a poor turnout in this area, the Basque Country had the highest abstention (the Basque Nationalist Party had endorsed abstention on the grounds that the Constitution was being forced upon them without any Basque input). To this, the "NO" vote in this referendum was also higher in the Basque Country than in the rest of the state. All in all, many Basques believe that they are not bound to a constitution that they never endorsed.
The Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country is a constitutional law but powers have been devolved gradually during decades according to re-negotiations between the Spanish and the consecutive Basque regional governments to reach an effective implementation, while the transfer of many powers are still due and has always been a matter of heated political discussion. Basque nationalists often put down this limitation in the devolution of powers to concessions made to appease the military involved in the 23-F coup d'état attempt (1981).
In 2003, the governing Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) proposed to alter this statute through the Ibarretxe Plan. The Ibarretxe bill, was approved in the Basque Parliament after much discussion, as it was subject to lengthy legal objections (on the grounds that it contradicts the Spanish Constitution), but it was subsequently rejected in the Spanish Parliament (Madrid Cortes Generales) in January 2005 by a large majority
Since the first autonomic cabinet, the Basque Nationalist Party has led office in the Basque Autonomous Community except for a 2009-2012 term, led by Patxi Lopez (PSE-PSOE). The current basque prime minister is Iñigo Urkullu, also member of the Basque Nationalist Party.
Economy.
The Basque Autonomous Community ranks first in Spain in terms of per capita income, with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita being 40% higher than that of the European Union and 33.8% higher than Spain's average in 2010, at €31,314. Industrial activities were traditionally centered on steel and shipbuilding, mainly due to the rich iron ore resources found during the 19th century around Bilbao. The Estuary of Bilbao was the center of the Basque Country's industrial revolution during the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. These activities decayed during the economic crisis of the 1970s and 1980s, giving ground for the development of the services sector and new technologies.
Today, the strongest industrial sectors of the Basque Country's economy are machine tool, present in the valleys of Biscay and Gipuzkoa; aeronautics in Vitoria-Gasteiz; and energy, in Bilbao.
The main companies in the Basque Country are: BBVA bank, Iberdrola energy company, (both of them have their headquarters in Bilbao) Mondragón Cooperative Corporation that is the largest cooperative in the world, Gamesa wind turbine producer and CAF rolling stock producer.
In 2012 and during the financial crisis the Basque Country outperformed Spain as a whole. Unemployment in the Basque Country is roughly 14.56%, a percentage in line with the EU average. Spain as a whole is the country with the highest unemployment rate in the European Union, at 24.6%.
In regards to GDP performance, Q4 meant that the Basque Country was out of recession with a 0.2% growth. The Spanish economy as a whole remained in recession after Q4.
During 2009 the Basque economy contracted by -3.3% compared to a -3.6% in the rest of Spain.
Transport.
The strategic geographical location of the Basque Country as a link between the northwest and centre of Spain and the rest of Europe makes this territory a very transited one.
Road.
The main backbones of road transport are the AP-8 motorway that links Bilbao, San Sebastián and the French border and the A-1 motorway that links San Sebastián and Gasteiz with central Spain.
Other important routes include the AP-68 motorway that links Bilbao with the Mediterranean.
Rail.
Eusko Trenbide Sarea ("Basque Railway Network") is the Basque Government-owned company that maintains and creates the railway infrastructure in the autonomous region. EuskoTren ("Basque Train") is the Basque Government-owned narrow gauge rail company that operates commuter services in Bilbao and San Sebastián, intercity Bilbao-San Sebastián service, and EuskoTran tram services in Bilbao and Vitoria-Gasteiz.
Metro Bilbao operates the two metro lines that serve the Greater Bilbao area.
The Spanish government owns two main RENFE broad gauge lines that link Gasteiz with San Sebastián and Bilbao with central Spain. It also operates Cercanías commuter lines in both Bilbao and San Sebastián.
FEVE narrow gauge company operates a commuter line between Bilbao and Balmaseda and links Bilbao with the rest of northern Spain.
A new high speed network (called Basque Y) is under construction, that will link the three capitals in 'Y' formation. It is scheduled to be completed in 2017, including a connection with the French TGV network in Hendaye. Because of the rough geography of the territory, most of the network will run through tunnels, with a total estimated cost of up to €10billion. The estimated ecological impact of the project has encouraged the formation of a group campaigning against it called "AHTrik Ez Elkarlana". The group uses social disobedience to oppose the project and promotes referendums against it in the towns it affects most. In spite of a relatively spread opposition of people to the project the work is going on.
Airports.
The three capitals have airports:
Of the three, the most important hub and entry point to the Basque Country is Bilbao Airport, offering many international connections and through which moved over 4,200,000 passengers in 2007.
Seaports.
The two most important ports are the Port of Bilbao and the Port of Pasaia. There are other minor fishing ports like Bermeo and Ondarroa.
The Port of Bilbao is by far the most important of the Basque Country and the north of Spain, being the fourth most important in Spain with over 38 million tons of traffic.
All the cruising routes arrive to Bilbao, there is a ferry service that links Bilbao with Portsmouth (United Kingdom).
Cuisine.
Basque cuisine is an important part of Basque culture. According to the chef Ferran Adrià, San Sebastián "in terms of the average quality of the food, in terms of what you can get at any place you happen to walk into, maybe it is - probably it is, yes - the best in the world." The most popular dishes are the seafood, fish (for example Marmitako) and the "Pintxos", bar finger food.
Basque food is one of the reasons for tourism to the Basque Country, especially the "pintxos". A popular way to socialize is ""ir de pintxos"" or "txikiteo", a Basque version of a pub crawl, albeit generally more civilized.
Politics.
Government.
The current laws configure the autonomous community as a federation of its present-day three constituent provinces. These western Basque districts kept governing themselves by their own laws and institutions even after the Castilian conquest in 1200. The new king upheld their institutional system issued from the consuetudinary law prevalent in Basque and Pyrenean territories. This limited self-government, similar to the one for Navarre, was partially suppressed in 1839 and totally in 1876 in exchange for an agreement on tax-collection and a number of administrative prerogatives. These in turn were suspended under Franco for Gipuzkoa and Biscay, but restored by the Spanish Constitution of 1978.
The post-Franco Spanish Constitution of 1978 acknowledges "historical rights" and attempts compromise in the old conflict between centralism and the different national identities (Basque, Catalan, and Galician). A specific approach to the national realities in Spain was eventually diffused by granting autonomous administrations and parliaments to all regions of Spain (e.g. Castile and León, Catalonia, the Valencian Community, etc.), while the Basques, Catalans, and Galicians were acknowledged historic specificity. Provincial governments ("diputación foral") with actual relevant attributes (taxation, etc.) were restored only in the autonomous communities of the Basque Country and Navarre, after the latter detached from the Basque political process. The provinces in the Basque Country still perform tax collection in their respective territories, but with limited margin in decision making under the Spanish and European governments. Under this intricate system, the "Diputaciones Forales" (Basque: "Foru Aldundiak") administer most of each of the provinces but are coordinated by the autonomous Basque Government (Spanish "Gobierno Vasco", Basque: "Eusko Jaurlaritza").
The autonomous community has its own police force (the Ertzaintza), controls Education and Health Systems, and has a Basque radio/TV station. These and only some of the powers acknowledge in the Gernika Statute have since 1980 been transferred to the Autonomous Community by the Cortes Generales under the Gernika Statute.
The seats of the Basque Parliament and Government are in Vitoria-Gasteiz, so this is the capital city "de facto", but the Basque Autonomous Community has no capital "de iure". The Parliament is composed of 25 representatives from each of the three provinces. The Basque Parliament elects the Lehendakari (President) who forms a government following regular parliamentary procedures. Until 2009 all "Lehendakaris" (even those in 1937 and during the exile) have been members of the Basque Nationalist Party (Euzko Alderdi Jeltzalea) (moderate and Christian-Democrat) since 1978. Despite their continued leadership role, they have not always enjoyed majorities for their party and have needed to form coalitions with either Spain wide parties or left-leaning Basque nationalist parties, often governing in a difficult minority position. Since 1982 until the late 1990s, Basque nationalists ideologically closer to ETA refused to turn out in the Basque parliament, a significant wedge of the parliament. 
Currently, the Basque Government is headed by Iñigo Urkullu (PNV). In the 2012 Basque parliamentary election, the PNV obtained a plurality of the votes, followed by the left-wing nationalist coalition EH Bildu (Eusko Alkartasuna, Sortu, Alternatiba). 
Present-day political dynamics.
ETA's permanent ceasefire (2010-2011) opened the possibility of new governmental alliances and has enabled EH Bildu's electoral success and rise to governmental institutions (Gipuzkoa, capital city Donostia). While a normalization could have been expected, the Basque political scene is currently gripped by a Spanish Government's rigid, uncompromising stance and the disruptive effect of Madrid central tribunals' (Constitutional Court, High Court, Audiencia Nacional) frequent and contentious meddling in Basque political and parliamentary decisions, as well as the increasing intervention of the regional deputy governors—directly accountable to the Spanish government—in Basque political and social life. This pattern is just about the same affecting nowadays Navarre.
Territorial issues.
The statute, insofar as it is addressed and provides an administrative framework for the Basque people, provides the mechanisms for neighbouring Navarre to join the three western provinces if it wishes to do so, since at least part of it is ethnically Basque. The Basque Government used the "Laurak Bat", which included the arms of Navarre, as its symbol for many years. The Navarrese Government protested, and tribunals ruled in their favour. The Basque Government replaced it with an empty red field.
Navarre is one of the historical Basque territories and even claimed by the Basque nationalists as the core of the Basque nation. There are also two enclaves surrounded by Basque territory—Treviño (Basque: "Trebiñu") and Valle de Villaverde (Basque: "Villaverde-Turtzioz")—which belong to the fellow neighbouring communities of Castile and León and Cantabria respectively, for which a legal connection to the Basque Country has become an on-off matter of political discussion.

Amberg–Schmidmühlen railway

The Amberg–Schmidmühlen railway was a 21 kilometre long Bavarian branch line in southern Germany. It ran through the county of Amberg-Sulzbach from Amberg along the river Vils as far as Schmidmühlen.
Although as early as 1904 the legal basis had been established for this "Lokalbahn" route that was to link Amberg along the Vils valley with Schmidmühlen, there were consiederable delays due to numerous arguments over questions of detail as well as over an extension of the line to Hohenburg in the Lauterach valley. The first section to Ensdorf, which branched off the line to Lauterhofen at Drahthammer station, was not opened until 1 May 1910. The second section followed on 18 December 1910, bringing the total length of the line to 21 kilometres. Passenger trains, however, started from Amberg, so that the journey was about 2 kilometres longer.
As a result of the increased use of railway buses in the 1950s and 1960s, passenger services on the rails were withdrawn on 1 July 1966. Goods traffic continued for considerably longer, albeit only for one customer: the limekiln belonging to the "Maxhütte" factory at Vilshofen. From time to time heavy goods trains, which needed three DB Class 211 diesel locomotives, ran to the kiln. But on 28 May 1988 that came to an end; the section south of Vilshofen had already closed on 31 May 1985.
In 1990 the route was purchased by the county ("Landkreis") and converted to a cycle path between 1991 and 1992.

Neuroscience and sexual orientation

Sexual orientation refers to an individual’s personal and social identity involving behaviors, ideas, and/or emotions concerning sexuality. The ultimate causes and mechanisms of sexual orientation development in humans remain unclear and many theories are speculative and controversial. However, advances in neuroscience explain and illustrate characteristics linked to sexual orientation. Studies have explored structural neural-correlates, functional and/or cognitive relationships, and developmental theories relating to sexual orientation in humans.
Developmental neurobiology.
Many theories concerning the development of sexual orientation involve fetal neural development, with proposed models illustrating prenatal hormone exposure, maternal immunity, and developmental instability. Other proposed factors include genetic control of sexual orientation. No conclusive evidence has been shown that environmental or learned effects are responsible for the development of non-typical sexual orientation.
Prenatal androgen model.
Sexual dimorphisms in the brain and behavior among vertebrates are accounted for by the influence of gonadal steroidal androgens as demonstrated in animal models over the past few decades. The prenatal androgen model of homosexuality describes the neuro-developmental effects of fetal exposure to these hormones. In 1985, Geschwind and Galaburda proposed that homosexual men are exposed to high androgen levels early in development, explaining their tendency to be less right-handed and by extension the hyper-masculinized traits observed in this population. It is currently argued that temporal and local variations in androgen exposure to a fetus’s developing brain is a factor in the pathways determining homosexuality. Recent research has been performed to find somatic markers for prenatal hormonal exposure which have been found to show variation based on sexual orientation in healthy adult individuals.
Other evidence supporting the role of testosterone and prenatal hormones in sexual orientation development include observations of male subjects with cloacal exstrophy who were sex-assigned as female during birth only later to declare themselves male. This supports the theory that the prenatal testosterone surge is crucial for gender identity development. Additionally, females whose mothers were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy show higher rates of bi- and homosexuality.
2D:4D digit ratio.
The best, non-invasive, marker of prenatal hormone exposure is the digit ratio of the second and fourth finger lengths (2D:4D ratio), a known sexually dimorphic measure (males showing lower ratios than females). Patients with androgen over-exposure (such as in congenital adrenal hyperplasia) show lower 2D:4D ratios, providing evidence linking prenatal androgen exposure as key to this feature. XY individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome due to a dysfunctional gene for the androgen receptor present as women and have feminine digit ratios, as would be predicted if androgenic hormones affect digit ratios. This finding also demonstrates that the sex difference in digit ratio is unrelated to the Y chromosome per se. Additionally, the 2D:4D ratio has been shown to be affected by variation in the androgen receptor gene in men. The ratio of testosterone to estrogen in amniotic fluid has also been found to be negatively correlated with the 2D:4D ratio. 
Independent studies indicate that homosexual women have masculinized (lower) digit ratios, and homosexual men show either hyper-masculinized or feminized ratios. These findings reinforce the prenatal androgen model - abnormal prenatal hormone exposure is related to the development of human homosexuality.
Auditory evoked potentials.
Studies of the central nervous system processing of auditory sensation, aspects of which has been linked to prenatal androgen exposure, to click-stimuli have shown that homosexual women have masculinized responses while homosexual men have hyper-masculinized responses.
Fraternal birth order effect.
Studies show that homosexual men have higher numbers of older male siblings. This finding led to the development of the fraternal birth order effect theory of homosexuality, stating that a mother becomes progressively immunized to successive male children, leading to increased chances of homosexuality in later male children. The mechanism involves the mother producing increasing anti-male antibodies to male-specific antigens expressed in male fetuses. These antibodies are thought to block the full masculinization of the fetal brain by “binding to and inactivating male-specific molecules located on the surface of fetal brain cells” thus preventing the morphogenesis of masculinized sexual preferences. Estimations indicate that there is a 33% increase in chances of homosexuality in a male child with each older male sibling. A BBC study reported that the fraternal birth order effect does not apply to left-handed homosexual males. Support for this theory is given by data indicating that the effect holds true only for biological brothers and the chances of male homosexuality is not increased by the number of older stepbrothers or adoptive siblings. This theory does not apply to the development of female homosexuality.
Developmental instability and handedness.
The chances of being left-handed may be increased in homosexual populations. In comparison with a heterosexual sample, a 2000 meta-analysis of earlier studies showed that homosexual men have approximately one-third (34%) higher odds of being left-handed while homosexual women have almost twice (91%) higher odds of being so. It has been proposed that non-right-handedness (including ambidexterity) is related to homosexuality through developmental instability. Developmental instability refers to the level of vulnerability to environmental and genetic stresses and perturbations during development.
However, as the effect is not particularly strong, the results remain disputed, even though several studies appear to show a relationship (Mutanski et al., 2002; Lippa, 2003).
Structural differences.
Postmortem and imaging studies over the past two decades have revealed structural differences in both global structures and sexually-related brain structures between heterosexual and homosexual subjects.
Hypothalamus.
The hypothalamus is known to be involved in sex differences in reproductive behavior, mediating responses in menstrual cycles in women and specifically the anterior hypothalamus of the brain helps regulate male-typical sexual behavior. Recently, the hypothalamus has been linked to gender identity and sexual orientation.
A seminal paper by Simon LeVay found that the an interstitial nucleus of the hypothalamus INAH3 was found to be dimorphic according to sexual orientation not gender. These results were obtained from postmortem analysis of hypothalamic nuclei of known homosexual subjects compared to heterosexual patients.
The hypothalamus is also linked to sexual orientation through findings that show that activity of aromatase, an important enzyme converting androgens to estrogens, is high in the preoptic hypothalamic region of mammals during the pre- and neonatal periods. This activity is linked to sexual differentiation and may be a basis in structural and functional sexual differences playing a role in mediating the sexual orientation development due to prenatal hormonal exposure. 
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus has also been found to relate to sexual orientation, with homosexual men having twice as large of a vasopressin-containing subnucleus of the SCN than heterosexuals. This might be a neurological explanation for the finding that homosexual men arise and retire earlier each day than heterosexuals, as it is known that the SCN is involved in modulating human circadian rhythms. Analogously, in a rat model study, it was found that male rats treated with an aromatase inhibitor showed a partner preference for females when tested in the late dark phase but showed homosexual mating preferences when tested in the early dark phase, implicating the involvement of the SCN in sexual orientation in other species.
Cerebral asymmetry.
The size of the brain’s hemispheres is a sexually dimorphic trait in which men tend to show asymmetry in the volumes of their hemispheres while women show volumetric symmetry. A recent volumetric MRI study indicated that homosexuals showed sex-atypical symmetry: homosexual men showed hemispheric volumes to be symmetric similar to heterosexual women and homosexual women showed asymmetry in hemispheric volumes as heterosexual men do. These findings demonstrate a global neurological difference in brain structures showing sex-atypical characteristics associated with sexual orientation.
Anterior commissure.
The anterior commissure, a bundle of white matter fibers connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, was found by Allen and Gorski to be larger in homosexual men and heterosexual women than in heterosexual men.
This finding provides a possible anatomical basis for higher inter-hemispheric functional connections in homosexuals explaining why homosexual men and heterosexual women show language circuit functional symmetry in out performing heterosexual men in verbal tests.
Functional differences.
Recent studies have begun exploring the functional and cognitive substrates of sexual orientation, ultimately a behavioral manifestation. Neural processing in response to specific stimuli and sexually-biased cognitive tasks have been found to be correlated with an individual’s sexual orientation.
Response to pheromones.
Two proposed human pheromones – the progesterone derivative 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and an estrogen-like steroid estra-1,3-5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST) – have been shown to have sexual orientation specific responses in activating the neural circuits of the anterior hypothalamus in homosexual and heterosexual subjects. The anterior hypothalamus is involved in processing reproductive functions and recent evidence suggests it helps integrate hormonal and sensory cues involved in sexual behavior and sexual preference. 
Recent functional neuro-imaging experiments have shown that the presentation of AND, found in male sweat, as an olfactory stimuli produced normal olfactory responses in heterosexual men and homosexual women, while activating the anterior hypothalamus in homosexual men and heterosexual women. The proposed pheromone EST, found in the urine of pregnant women, produces normal olfactory activation in homosexual men and heterosexual women while homosexual women and heterosexual men demonstrated sexually-related hypothalamic responses. 
Homosexual men showed the same sexually-related functional responses to these stimuli as heterosexual women and homosexual women responded like heterosexual men. This research conducted by Berglund and Savic indicates overall that AND and EST induce “sex-specific effects on the autonomic nervous system” and that the stimuli elicited a response pathway that was dependent on the subject’s sexual orientation rather than phenotypic sex.
Functional cerebral asymmetry.
Differences in neural processing and cognitive tasks have been found in relation to sexual orientation. In a 1987 review on cognition, cerebral lateralization, and sexual orientation, Sanders and Ross-Field suggested that prenatal hormonal events would lead to functional cerebral asymmetries related to sexual orientation.
Certain cognitive tasks are known to be sexually dimorphic. The better verbal ability of women is associated with reduced lateralization of language tasks while the male advantage in spatial tasks corresponds to marked cerebral lateralization. Sexual orientation effects in some of these tasks have been found in recent studies.
In the Vincent Mechanical Diagrams test, a dot detection divided field measure of functional cerebral asymmetry, homosexual men performed the same as heterosexual women with both scoring lower than heterosexual men displaying less asymmetry. Additionally, homosexual men display higher verbal performance IQ scores on subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, in concordance with female testing patterns. On several other tests, including a male-biased targeted throwing task and a female-biased Purdue Pegboard Test, the performance of homosexual men and heterosexual women showed no statistical difference from each other, while both significantly differed from heterosexual men. 
Additionally, reduced asymmetry was found in a magnetoencephelographic study in which MEG-based source location estimates of an auditory evoked signal is found to be hemispherically symmetric in heterosexual women and homosexual men, while asymmetric in heterosexual men.
Response to visual sexual stimuli.
A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging study has demonstrated that upon viewing of both heterosexual and homosexual erotic visual stimuli, only those images corresponding to the subject’s sexual orientation produced hypothalamic activation patterns associated with sexual arousal. The response of heterosexuals viewing heterosexual adult videos showed the same pattern of sexual arousing neural processing as homosexuals viewing same-sex adult videos, while the viewing of the opposite orientation’s images did not elicit the same response.
Related studies.
Various animal and insect models have been used to explore sexual orientation and brain characteristics. One experiment involved genetically altering male Drosophila causing them to have feminized brain structures involved in processing sexually dimorphic contact pheromones. Transformed males showed increase homosexual courtship behaviors to wild-type male flies, and there a correlation was found between the courtship behavior and the expression of the altered gene in the sexually related brain regions.
A 2004 study exploring the difference in brain metabolism between heterosexual and homosexual males found that homosexuals had a significant reduction in hypothalamic glucose metabolism compared to that of heterosexuals with other brain regions including the prefrontal association cortex and portions of the cingulate cortex showing differences in the measured activation.
Future studies.
The development of sexual orientation is a far from complete subject. While neuroscience has made advancements shedding light on the mechanisms and relationships between the human brain and sexual orientation, much more further research should be conducted. 
Areas for future research include:

Érdy-codex

The Érdy-codex is the largest collection of Hungarian legends, and greatest volume of Hungarian language in history.
It is middle-sized folio paper codex written mostly with running letters, while at some parts, especially in capitals, and in epistolas it is in printed capital letters. The codex was written by one author, who is probably a Carthusian monk, who finished his work on 23rd of November, 1527, the day of Saint Clement, according to the last page. The place of its origin and their owners are unknown. The only thing certain, is that in the 17th century it was the property of Seminarium of Nagyszombat (today: Trstena, Slovakia), which, with the help of abbot Ferenc Stipsics, it moved to the library of Hungarian National Museum in 1814. It is now kept at National Széchényi Library.
The content of the work is preachings for the whole year, however, in one part, it is citing the legends of ninety most important Saints. It also lists Saints of the Hungarian history, namely St Stephen, St Ladislaus, St Emerick, St. Elisabeth, St Gellert, etc.
The codex itself was based on Latin works of Pelbart of Temesvár from the 15th century.
The name was given by Ferenc Toldy from the person who made the first publications of it, János Érdy.

Tel Hanaton

Tel Hanaton (Arabic: Tal Badawiye; meaning 'The Nomads' Tel') is a Bronze Age Tel situated at the Western edge of the Beit Netofa Valley, in the western Lower Galilee region of Israel, 2 km South of the Town of Kfar Manda and 1 km ENE of the modern settlement which took its name, Kibbutz Hanaton.
Etymology of Hanaton.
For much of the Middle Bronze Age this area of Ancient Israel was under the control of the Pharaohs of Egypt, either as provinces and city-states ruled by Egyptian Governors; or by vassal Canaanite kings who paid annual homage (tribute) to the ruling Pharaoh. It is possible that the city was named for Pharaoh Amenhotep IV also known by the name Akhenaten, the founder of a brief period of monotheism (Atenism) from the 18th dynasty of rulers of Egypt during 1352-1334 BC. The name Hanaton (pronounced Khanaton) and the name Akhenaten have identical consonants, which in the Semitic languages of the period are more significant than vowels, which may vary.
Archaeology.
The tel has been subject to archaeological survey, but not to extensive excavations. The tel rises to 75m above the surrounding valley, part of which represents the stratification layers on which the Bronze Age and later settlements were built on a natural outcrop of rock.
Investigators maintain that the settlement was first established in the Middle Bronze Age. The site has ideal geographical criteria for such a settlement to have been established, with easy access to water sources; nearby forested areas for wood; Limestone hills to quarry for building materials and tools; fertile surrounding arable land for crops and livestock; the presence of clay for pottery in the muddy earth surrounding the tel caused by seasonal flooding; the natural rock outcrop raised above its surroundings for easy fortification and its sitting astride an international trade route of the period - a branch of the Via Maris.
Middle Bronze Age (Canaanite Period).
The Tel is mentioned in the 14th Century BC Amarna Letters of Ancient Egypt, showing the city's importance on a major trade route.
Hanaton is mentioned some 700 years later in records at Niniveh, the capital of Ancient Assyria as one of the 5 cities totally destroyed by Tiglath-pileser III, King of Assyria, in the campaign of conquest of the (Northern) Biblical Kingdom of Israel between 724-722 BC.
The area of the Bronze Age city reached 100 dunams (approx. 25 acres) which attests to the power and wealth of the settlement, most likely achieved due to the large tracts of highly fertile arable land surrounding the tel in the Beit Netofa Valley, together with its position astride a major 'Egypt to Mesopotamia' international trade route for the period.
Iron Age (Israelite Period).
Most Bronze Age tels were forced by increasing populations to expand beyond their hilltops during the Iron (Israelite) age, protected by retaining walls built further out encompassing a greater area. In these cases the former Tel forms the acropolis of the expanded city.
Hanaton could not expand in this manner as its immediately surrounding land was subject to months-long flooding following winter rains and drainage technology of the period did not allow for drying up such land.
Restricted in this manner from expansion, the city, whilst never abandoned through to the Roman Period, and unable to expand to the size of Hellenistic period cities, continually declined and was replaced as a major trading and urban centre by nearby Tzippori (Sephoris) which was established on the ridge a few kilometres to the south east.
Later History.
During the Early Arab Period, the site became a small agricultural village named Hotsfit, a name which survived into the Crusader Period.
In spite of a complete lack of reference from the Crusader period, investigating historians have reached a consensus that the visible physical evidence of typical Frankish construction with stone stairwells, large halls and arched ceilings, points to the presence at least of an 11th-century fortified agricultural settlement, which probably, together with nearby Tzippori (Sephoris/Dioceserea), guarded the large surrounding tracts of intensive agriculture throughout the first and second crusades Kingdom of Jerusalem, falling to the Saracens only around the time of the fall of the city of Acre. The architecture, whilst having much in common with that of concurrent strongholds of the Ayyubid period, has distinct Crusader features, such as the arch-free flat-roofed stairwells (see photo).
In the 1330s the region was conquered by the Mamelukes of Egypt, who used the Crusader fort to house their garrison.
The Arabic name for the tel, Tal Badawiye relates to the Ottoman Period when a Caravanserai named Khan El Badawiye was established atop the tel.
Biblical Reference.
Tel Hanaton is associated with the biblical Hanaton, mentioned in The Book of Joshua in the lands apportioned to the Tribe of Zevulun: "Then the border went around it on the north side of Hannathon, and it ended in the Valley of Jiphthah El." (Joshua 19:14)

Sewu

Sewu is an 8th-century Buddhist temple located 800 meters north of Prambanan in Central Java. Candi Sewu is actually the second largest Buddhist Temple in Central Java after Borobudur. Candi Sewu predates "Loro Jonggrang". Although originally only around 249 temples are present, the name in Javanese translates to 'a thousand temples,' which originated from popular local folklore; The Legend of Loro Jonggrang. The original name of this temple compound is probably Manjusrigrha.
History.
Based on the Kelurak inscription (dated from 782) and Manjusrigrha inscription (dated from 792), which was found in 1960, the original name of the temple complex was probably "Manjusri grha" (The House of Manjusri). Manjusri is a Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhist teaching. Sewu Temple was probably built in the 8th century at the end of Rakai Panangkaran administration. Rakai Panangkaran (746 – 784 AD) was a famous King from the Medang Kingdom. The temple was probably expanded and completed during Rakai Pikatan's rule, a Sanjaya dynasty prince whom married to a Buddhist princess of Sailendra dynasty, Pramodhawardhani. Most of his subjects retained their old religion after the return of Sanjaya dynasty. The proximity of the temple to Prambanan Temple, which is a Hindu Temple, suggests that the Hindus and Buddhist lived in harmony in the era that the temples were built. The scale of the temple complex suggests Candi Sewu was a Royal Buddhist Temple and was an important religious site of the past. The temple is located on the Prambanan Plain, that is between the southern eastern slopes of Merapi volcano and the Sewu mountain range in the south, near the present border of the Yogyakarta province and Klaten Regency, in Central Java. The plain houses many archaeological sites scattered only a few miles away, suggesting that this area was an important religious, political, and urban center.
The temple was severely damaged during the earthquake in Java in 2006. The structural damage is significant and the central temple suffered the worst. Large pieces of debris were scattered over the ground and cracks between stone blocks were detected. To prevent the central temple from collapse, the metal frame structures were erected on four corners and attached to support the main temple. Although some weeks later in 2006 the site were re-opened for visitors, the whole part of main temple remains off-limits for safety reasons.
The temple complex.
The temple complex is the largest Buddhist compound in the Prambanan area, with rectangular grounds that measure 185 meter north-south and 165 meter east-west. The entrance is found on all four cardinal points, however judging from the layout of the temple complex, the main entrance is located on the east side. Each of the entrances were guarded by twin Dvarapala statues. This large guardian statues have been better preserved and replicas can be found at Jogja Kraton. There are a total of 249 buildings in the complex arranged in a Mandala pattern around the central main hall as an expression of the view of the universe of Mahayana Buddhism. The smaller temples are called "Perwara" (guardian) temples, consist of 240 temples with similar design and arranged in four rectangular concentric rows. Two outer rows are arranged closer and consists of 168 smaller temples, while two inner rows are arranged in certain interval and consist of 72 temples than the outer ones. The 249 temples that are located in the second precinct all were made with a square frame but varied by different statues and orientations. Many of these statues are now gone and the arrangements on the current site are not in the original orientations. The statues are comparable to the statues of Borobudur and were likely made of bronze. 
Along the north-south and east-west central axis at a distance of about 200 meter, between 2nd and 3rd row of smaller temple are located the "penjuru" (main directions) or "perwara utama" (main vanguard) temples, a couple on each cardinal points facing each other. The "perwara utama" temples are the second largest ones after the main temple, however only eastern twin "perwara utama" and a northern one still remains today. These smaller temples encompass a larger sanctuary that has been heavily looted. 
Behind the 4th row of smaller temples lies the stone paved courtyard where the main temple stood on the center.
The main temple.
The main temple, with a ground plan in the shape of a 20-sided polygon, measures 29 meters in diameter and soars up to 30 meters high. On each of the four cardinal points of the main temple, there are four structures projected outward, each with its own stairs and entrances, crowned with stupas, thus forming a cross-like layout. All of the structures made are of the andesite stones. 
The main temple have five rooms, one large garbhagriha in the center and four smaller rooms in each cardinal directions. These four rooms are all connected with outer corner galleries with balustrades. From the findings during the reconstruction process, the original design of central sanctuary only consisted of a central roomed temple surrounded by four additional structures with open portals. Doorways were added later. The portals were narrowed to create door frames to attach wooden doors. Some of the holes to attach doors were still visible. The doorways join the temples together into one main building with five rooms. 
The central chamber can be reached from the eastern room. The central chamber is larger than other rooms with a higher roof. Now all the five rooms are empty. However the lotus carved stone padestal in central chamber suggested that the temple once contains a large bronze Buddhist statue (possible the bronze statue of Manjusri), probably reaching 4 meters tall. The statue is missing, probably being looted for scrap metal over centuries. However another theory suggested that the main statue was probably constructed from several stone blocks coated with "vajralepa" plaster.

La Rioja (Spain)

La Rioja (; ) is an autonomous community and a province in Spain, located in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Its capital is Logroño. Other cities and towns in the province include Calahorra, Arnedo, Alfaro, Haro, Santo Domingo de la Calzada, and Nájera. It has an estimated population of 322,415 inhabitants (INE 2010).
It covers part of the Ebro valley towards its north and the Iberian Range in the south. The community is a single province, so there is no County Council and it is organized into 174 municipalities. It borders the Basque Country (province of Álava) to the north, Navarre to the northeast, Aragón to the southeast (province of Zaragoza), and Castilla y León to the west and south (provinces of Burgos and Soria).
The area was formerly occupied by pre-Roman Berones, Pelendones and Basques. After partial recapture to the Muslims in the early tenth century, the region became part of the Kingdom of Pamplona, later being incorporated into Castile after a century and a half of disputes. From the eighteenth century the Rioja region remained divided between the provinces of Burgos and Soria, until in 1833 the province of Logroño was created, changing the name of the province to La Rioja in 1980 as a prelude to its constitution under a single provincial autonomous community following the adoption of the Estatuto de San Millán in 1982. The first written reference in which the name Rioja appears is in the Miranda de Ebro forum in 1099.
The region is well known for its wines under the brand "Origen Calificada Rioja".
History.
In Roman times the territory of La Rioja was inhabited by the tribes of the Berones (central country), Autrigones (upper country, extending also north and west of it) and the Vascones (lower country, extending also north and east of it). It was part of the province of Hispania Tarraconensis.
In Medieval times La Rioja was often a disputed territory. The Visigoths created the Duchy of Cantabria that probably included most of La Rioja, as a border march against the Vascones. The area was invaded by the Muslims at the beginning of the eighth century. After the Muslim invasion of 711, La Rioja fell into the Muslim domains of Al Andalus.
Most of the territory was reconquered in the early 10th century, in 923, by Sancho I of Pamplona, acting for the Kingdom of Pamplona together with the Kingdom of León and the Counts of Castile, feudal lords of the Leonese King. The lower region around Arnedo came under control of his allies the Banu Qasi of Tudela. The territory to the east of the Leza River remained under Muslim control. 
Later there was a dispute between the Castilian Count Fernán González and the kings of Pamplona-Navarra, involving great battles. It was decided in favour of the Navarrese after the imprisonment of the Count family in Cirueña, in 960. La Rioja briefly formed the independent Kingdom of Viguera from 970 to about 1005, at which point it became a part of the Kingdom of Pamplona. 
Sancho Garcés moved the capital of the Kingdom of Pamplona to Nájera (La Rioja), creating the so-called kingdom of Nájera-Pamplona which was, due to its large size,  the first Spanish Empire.
After the independence of Castile in 1035, this new kingdom fiercely fought against Pamplona for the possession of Bureba, La Rioja and other territories. In 1076, after the murder of Sancho VI, Navarre was divided among Castile and Aragon. Castile obtained La Rioja and many other Navarrese lands.
Nevertheless, since 1134, García Ramírez "the Restorer" and his son Sancho VI "the Wise" fought bitterly with Castile for the recovery of the former Pamplonese domains. Only in 1179 would they sign a peace agreement by which La Rioja was ceded definitively to Castile.
The territory remained divided between the provinces of Burgos and Soria until the administrative reform of Riego in 1822 that created the province of Logroño.
In 1980 it changed its name to province of La Rioja and in 1982 it was constituted as uni-provincial autonomous community with that name.
Dinosaur footprints.
During the Early Cretaceous period the geographical area of Cameros was part of a flooded plain that drained periodically,  leaving behind muddy areas where dinosaur tracks marked the path. Eventually they were dried and covered with new sediment layers whose weight pressed down on the lower layers, causing them to solidify into rocks over millions of years. Erosion has been wearing down the upper layers making many of these rock formations visible, bringing into view the footprints (footprints fossils). La Rioja is notable for the number and conservation of these sites, in addition to those found in the north of Soria, such as Yanguas, Santa Cruz de Yanguas and other highland locations.
Recent history.
The territory of La Rioja (the name appeared in a charter of 1099) was formerly known as the province of Logroño for the fortified site around which it developed. The 12th-century church Iglesia de Santa Maria de Palacio recalls its origin as a chapel of the administrative palace. Logroño was a borderland disputed between the kings of Navarre and the kings of Castile starting in the 10th century; the region was awarded to Castile in a judgement by Henry I of England and annexed in 1173 (1177?). Its importance was that here the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela, the "Camino de Santiago", crossed the River Ebro on the stone bridge, the "Puente de Piedra".
La Rioja was taken by Napoleonic forces in the Peninsular War and remained solidly in French hands until 1814.
In the 1810 project of Llorente it was to be a part of the prefecture of Arlanzón (capital in Burgos).
The Constitutional Cortes declared La Rioja an independent province at the time of the Liberal Constitution of 1812, and in January 1822 the province of Logroño was created by royal decree, taking in the whole of the historical geography of La Rioja. However, Ferdinand VII soon annulled these decisions and recovered most of the divisions of the Ancien Régime.
In the 1833 reorganization, a province of Logroño appeared again in the region of Castilla la Vieja.
In 1841, the province increased its territory temporarily.
It was made into an autonomous community during the reorganization following the democratic transition after the death of Francisco Franco, owing to its economic distinction from the surrounding regions. It is the second-smallest autonomous community in Spain and has the smallest population; fully half of its 174 municipalities have populations under 200. Nearly half of its citizens live in the capital.
Geography.
La Rioja is bordered by the Basque Country (province of Álava), Navarre, Aragón (province of Zaragoza), and Castile and León (provinces of Soria and Burgos). The river Ebro flows through this region, as does the river Oja, after which it is named.
After the Ebro river flows through the narrow channel between the rocks of the Conchas de Haro, it reaches La Rioja, through which it runs for 120 km, before continuing its journey to the Mediterranean. In the Conchas de Haro the altitude of the river is 445 m and when it leaves the community, in the Sotos del Ebro Natural Reserve in Alfaro, it is 260 m high. The river therefore flows very quickly through La Rioja.

</poem>
The Ebro runs through the north of the community. The entire right bank (which is to the south) belongs to La Rioja. On the left bank there are only three municipalities, Briñas, San Vicente de la Sonsierra and Ábalos (known as the Riojan Sonsierra), although Logroño, Agoncillo, Alcanadre, Rincón de Soto and Alfaro are also part of the municipality's territory on that bank. Because of their proximity, the Álava area between the Ebro and the Sierra de Cantabria is called Rioja Alavesa.
The Iberian mountain range, with altitudes ranging between 1,000 and 2,000 meters, extends parallel to the south of the river for about 60 to 40 km. From the mountain range it moves towards the north, going deep into La Rioja, the Demanda mountains, and in the Monte San Lorenzo where, at 2271 m, it represents the highest altitude in La Rioja.
Seven rivers descend rapidly towards the Ebro from the mountain range, which is why La Rioja is sometimes called: "Zone of the seven valleys". They are, from east to west, Alhama, Cidacos, Leza, Iregua, Najerilla, Oja and Tirón, although the headwaters of the Alhama and Cidacos originate in Soria and those of Najerilla-Neila and Tirón are from Burgos. Sometimes Linares (a tributary of Alhama) is added, grouping Tirón with its tributary, the Oja.
All the rivers of these valleys form tributaries that go on to form as many valleys in their own right, such as those of Linares, Ocon, Jubera, Tuerto, Brieva, Viniegras and San Millán. There is an almost unlimited number of grandiose canyons, quite splendid in nature, such as Aguas Buenas, Nieva, Manzanares, Ardancha, Navajún, Valderresa, Ollora, Tobia, San Martín and others.
In the highlands oaks, beech and pine are grown. There are also thickets of juniper, boxwood, sloes, holly and cistus. There are grand hillsides with fine pasture for livestock, cattle and sheep. In the lower areas there are oaks, olive and almond trees. Near the Ebro, in the plains, the land is used for cereal, sugar beet and potatoes, while the hills are covered with vast vineyards of the wine that has brought worldwide fame to this region.
All Riojan rivers, including the Ebro, have a row of poplars and cottonwood. About the Riojan Alamos Ana Maria Matute has written: "... see them on the edge of the water, turning the landscape, like spears magical pointing towards the unreal and mysterious country of the riverbed."
Mountains and mountain ranges.

Economy.
La Rioja is known for its production of Rioja DOCa wines (although the Rioja viticultural region extends slightly into the neighboring administrative regions of Álava and Navarra).
Main products from La Rioja sold to Spain include:
Exports are directed mostly towards the European Union, United States and Canada.
Demography.
According to the INE the population of La Rioja (as at 2010) is 322,415 inhabitants, with 161,884 men and 160,531 women, which is 713 more than in 2009. Its population density is 63.76 people per km2. It is the least populous autonomous community in Spain. Its capital, Logroño, with approximately 152,500 inhabitants, is its most populous city.
La Rioja has 174 municipalities (see "List of municipalities in La Rioja"). According to the same INE data, there are more men than women in 150 of them, in two the numbers are the same and in 22 there are more females than males. In the latter set, the differences are small, except in the capital where there are 4,868 more women than men.
Education.
According to the 2007 PISA report, education in La Rioja is of the highest quality in Spain, close to that of other European countries with better overall educational levels in terms of student knowledge. In the Ministry of Education's 2009 report La Rioja was in first position among the autonomous communities as it relates to general aspects of primary and secondary education.
It is placed above the Spanish average in the list of communities with the lowest levels of school failure, with 85% of students being able to obtain the ESO title, despite its schools having the highest proportion of enrolled immigrants.
6208 euros are spent per pupil, making it the tenth ranked community in this regard. The majority of educational institutions in the community are public, followed by subsidized and private schools, the latter of which are very scarce at the primary and secondary levels. The bachillerato is free in public schools and at a cost in charter schools.
In La Rioja the portion of the population with higher education is 30.6%, with two institutions offering studies at this level: the University of La Rioja (UR) and the National University of La Rioja (UNIR).
Communication and transportation.
La Rioja has connections by air via the Logroño-Agoncillo Airport.
Rail journeys to Madrid, Zaragoza, Barcelona, Valladolid, Oviedo, Bilbao, La Coruna, Vigo are possible, since the Castejón-Miranda line crosses the region from east to west. The main railway station is that at Logroño.
Road communications between La Rioja and neighboring regions are primarily through the AP-68. Additional highways have been built, such as the Autovía A-12 which connects Pamplona to Logroño from 2006, and in the future will reach Burgos.

Vehicle registration plates of Tunisia

Tunisian vehicle registration plate allows the identification of vehicles registered in Tunisia.
Overview.
It takes the form XXX تونس XXXX where X is a number between 0 and 9. Writing in white on a black background. The first three digits designate the series and the last four digits denote the number of vehicle registration in the series. The serial and registration number are separated by the name of Tunisia in Arabic.
The passage of a series to the next is for each record in 9999 vehicles. Registration is awarded to any vehicle, except those which are the property:
For example : 03 is the Ministry of Justice, 15 is the Ministry of Transport.
The right XXXXX numbers designate the registration of the Ministry-owned vehicle.
Ambassadors cars have the "CMD" inscription (Chef de Mission Diplomatique), in the form "XX CMD ر ب د XX" with 01 on the right side of the plate.
Series dates.
Each series of vehicle registration refers to a year and hence its age. However, there is no rule and this depends on how many vehicles have been registered in a specific year. 
For example, series can last more than a whole year if less than 9999 vehicles are registered. But since in Tunisia an average of 50,000 new vehicles are registered each year, five series of number plates are issued. Late 140 series or early 141 series are expected by the end of 2009.

<doc id="20515240" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20515240" title="Royer oscillator">
Royer oscillator

A Royer oscillator is an electronic oscillator circuit based on a relaxation oscillation, saturable-core transformer. It is used for DC to AC low frequency inverters. It was invented and patented in 1954 by George H. Royer. It has the advantages of simplicity, low component count, rectangle waveforms and easy transformer isolation.
Circuit description.
The circuit consists of a saturable-core transformer with a center-tapped primary winding, a feedback winding and (optionally) a secondary winding. The two halves of the primary are driven by two transistors in push-pull configuration. The feedback winding couples a small amount of the transformer flux back in to the transistor bases to provide positive feedback, generating oscillation. The oscillation frequency is determined by the maximum magnetic flux density, the power supply voltage, and the inductance of the primary winding.
The need to use a saturable-core limits the choice of core material. Some common materials are:
Current mode operation.
A drawback of the voltage mode operation is that the stress on switch transistors is high during the cross over time, when both the voltage and current are high. This drawback is alleviated by using current mode operation. This is achieved by inserting an inductor in the transformer center tap supply. This inductor drops the center tap voltage down when the dI/dt would be very high in voltage mode.
Applications.
The Royer oscillator circuit is used in DC–AC inverters. It relies solely on transformer core saturation to cause switching between the two states, unlike the similar "collector resonance" circuit assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories and P.J.Baxandall which is commonly used to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlights for LCD displays. CCFL inverters produce a sinusoidal waveform to maximize efficiency and battery life in portable equipment, and which is used in switching power supply and converter applications such as flyback transformers and power supplies.

Sari temple

Candi Sari ( also known as "Candi Bendah"), is an 8th-century Buddhist temple located at Dusun Bendan, Tirtomartani village, Kalasan, Sleman regency, Yogyakarta. 
It is located about 130 metres north east from Kalasan temple. The temple was a two storey building with wooden beams, floors, stairs completed with windows and doors; all from organic materials which now are decayed and gone. It is suggested that the original function of this building was a vihara (Buddhist monastery), a dwelling place for monks. The temple's name "Sari" or "Saré" translates as "to sleep" in Javanese, which also confirms the habitation nature of the building.
History.
Historians suggested that the temple was built around the same time as the Kalasan temple. The Kalasan inscription dated 778 AD, in Pranagari script written in Sanskrit, mentions that the temple was erected by the will of "Guru Sang Raja Sailendravamçatilaka" (the Jewel of the Sailendra family) who succeeded in persuading Maharaja Tejapurnapana Panangkaran (in other parts of the inscription also called as Kariyana Panangkaran) to construct a holy building for the goddess (boddhisattva devi) Tara and also build a vihara (monastery) for Buddhist monks from Sailendra family's realm. Panangkaran awarded the Kalara village to the Sangha (the Buddhist monastic community). Based on this inscription, Candi Sari was probably the monastery for monks who served the nearby Kalasan temple.
The ruins were discovered in early 20s, and in 1929, an effort to reconstruct the temple began and was finished in 1930. However it was incomplete because many parts are missing including the outer base that surrounds the temple, and the extended front room and front stairs that once projected from the east wall of the temple.
Architecture.
The temple consists of three parts; the base, the body, and the roof. The temple has a rectangular plan, measuring 17.3 m north-south, 10 m west-east, and soaring 17 m in height. Only some parts of the base remain, the outer base stoneblocks are missing. The entrance door is located at the eastern side with a gate adorned with a Kala and elephant carving. Windows surround the walls and consist of lower and upper rows. There is also a horizontal middle "belt" line around the wall, suggesting that it was a two storey building.
The interior consists of three rooms; north room, central room, and south room, each measuring 3 m x 5.8 m. These three rooms are connected with doorways on the eastern side of the room along the north-south axis. On the wall of each room are found rows of extruding stone blocks which used to support wooden beams and a wooden ceiling separating the upper and lower floors. In some places there are diagonal stones which is probably the place where there used to be a wooden stairway.
The upper level was probably used by monks for meditation or worship. Some suggest the upper rooms were used as the place for monks to stay, rest, or sleep, while the lower rooms was the place for worship. In the lower rooms there are some elevated parts where statues were once placed, but now the statues are gone. On the side walls are found niches, probably to place oil lamps. In the inner part of each window there are holes to install wooden window bars.
These rooms were topped with three horse-shoe arched niches adorned with Kala-makaras and crowned with three rows of stupas. Between these arched niches are found rain-water drainage and "jaladwara" water spouts taking the form of a giant sitting on a snake.
The outer wall is richly decorated with Buddhist deities. External decoration include Tara with flowers and Bodhisattvas with musical instruments. These figures are arranged in two upper and two lower rows and placed on each side of the windows. They form a total of 36 statues: 8 on the east, north, and south sides respectively, and 12 on the west side. 
These Buddhist figures are usually found in the graceful position of "Tribhanga", holding red or blue lotuses and displaying peaceful and serene facial expressions. 
Images of Kinnara-Kinnari also adorn the walls. However, unlike the common depiction of Kinnara as heavenly creature with an upper human-shaped part and a lower bird-shaped part, the unusual image of Kinnara found on the northern wall shows a winged deity (somewhat similar to how commonly angels are portrayed).
On the outer wall of the temple are found the traces of plaster called vajralepa (lit: diamond plaster). The same substance is also found in the nearby Kalasan temple. The white-yellowish plaster was applied to protect the temple wall, but now the plaster has worn off.

Lelievlet

The Lelievlet is the most commonly used steel sailing and rowing boat of the Sea Scouts of Scouting Nederland, it is also used by many Sea Scouts in Flanders and the National Water Activities Centre (NWAC) of Scouting Ireland in Killaloe, Ireland. Its design is based upon the beenhakkervlet, a type of steel dinghy often used with cargo riverboats, and its name is derived from the international Scout logo, the Scout lily.
History.
Until the 1950s the Dutch Sea Scouts employed many different boats. Often these were a discarded lifeboat from the navy or other types of boats. These boats were almost always full of wood, making the maintenance so expensive in terms of time and cost. It was also difficult to source parts to enable repairs. This situation prompted a project to identify a standard vessel. The standard boat also made the running of regatta’s easier as all the boats were of equal class. The vessel requirements were set as:
In 1955, the Dutch Sea Scouts looking for a boat to meet these requirements and they became interested in a steel rowing boat, designed by Teunis Beenhakker, Kinderdijk. He had created a design for a rowing and motorboating for inland waterway skippers. The groups saw something in that draft and Mr. A. Stockman, skipper with Titus Brandsmagroep in Breda and Commissioner at the "Katholieke Verkenners" (Catholic Boy Scouts), adapted the design so it could be used as a sailboat. In 1956 Teunis Beenhakker built two hulls for trial. He made two almost equal hulls: one 4.60 m and the other 5.60 m. Both were built as sailing boats with 12.5 m2 sails. Ultimately, the 5.60 m boat was selected as most suitable.
The lelievlet was, as had been predicted a great success. Until 2006 in the Netherlands there have been about 1600 lelievlet’s built. Lelievlet number '1' still exists and is still under the flag of the Titus Brandsma Group from Breda. 
There are now also a large number of hulls by vmbo schools built under license, under the flag of the Botenbouwpoject "Vletten op de Maas" (Vlets on the Meuse).

Tame Impala

Tame Impala (pronounced ) is a psychedelic rock band led by Kevin Parker, from Perth, Australia and signed to Modular Recordings. The band came to prominence in 2010 with the release of their debut album "Innerspeaker", and received critical acclaim for their 2012 album "Lonerism". Their name refers to the impala, a medium sized antelope. They describe themselves as "a steady flowing psychedelic groove rock band that emphasizes dream-like melody."
Biography.
Early career.
The origins of the band can be found in the Perth music scene. Parker played in a number of bands, one being the Dee Dee Dums, a rock duo that consisted of Parker (guitar) and Luke Epstein (drums). Tame Impala emerged as a Kevin Parker home-recording project in this period and he posted a number of tracks on Myspace. This brought interest from a number of labels and eventually, he signed a worldwide deal with the independent Modular Recordings. To transfer these recordings to a live-stage, Parker enlisted the help of Dominic Simper (bass) and Jay Watson (drums) and began playing at some local gigs. At this time, Tame Impala releases many demo that Still in Rock recently unveiled.
"Tame Impala" EP.
The signing was soon followed by the release on their self-titled debut EP in September 2008. Due to Parker's original artwork there was some confusion with the EP title and many believed it to be called "Antares Mira Sun". The artwork is an interpretation of a slide he saw in an astronomy lecture, which demonstrated the difference in size between the stars Antares, Mira and the Sun.
"Tame Impala" attained the number 1 position on the Australian Independent Record Labels (AIR) Chart and number 10 on the ARIA Physical Singles Chart, with three songs, "Desire Be, Desire Go", "Half Full Glass of Wine" and "Skeleton Tiger" receiving national radio airplay on the Triple J radio station.
Tours in 2008 included supports for You Am I, The Black Keys, Yeasayer and MGMT, as well as performances at Southbound Festival, Meredith Music Festival and Falls Festival, as well as national headline tours in support of their EP. Tours in 2009 included a sold-out six-date 'Skeleton Tiger' national headline tour and a five-date UK tour (including Nevereverland UK), as well as performances at V Festivaland Groovin The Moo, and a stadium tour with The Living End and Gyroscope.
Tame Impala appeared on Triple J's Hottest 100 list in 2008—their first appearance on the list— with "Half Full Glass of Wine" at number 75. The song is also on the Hottest 100 compilation album.
"Sundown Syndrome".
Tame Impala's first single, "Sundown Syndrome", was recorded at Toerag Studios in London, UK with recording engineer Liam Watson, while the band was in the UK in March 2009. "Sundown Syndrome" was premiered by Richard Kingsmill on his "2009" show on Triple J on Sunday 10 May 2009. The song was released in July 2009 on vinyl, and digitally with a cover of "Remember Me" by DJ Blue Boy.
The band then headlined the inaugural "Rottofest" in August 2009, an annual comedy, film and music festival held on Rottnest Island off the coast of Western Australia. Following Rottofest, they embarked on a national tour through September and October 2009 in support of the single. "Remember Me" appeared at number 78 on Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2009.
"Sundown Syndrome" was included on the soundtrack of the Oscar-nominated film "The Kids Are All Right." "Half Full Glass of Wine" was used in HBO's popular television series "Entourage" as the closing song for an episode.
Tame Impala appeared at the Australian/New Zealand Big Day Out festival in early 2010, performing alongside bands such as Muse, The Mars Volta, Kasabian and Rise Against.
"Innerspeaker".
Tame Impala's debut album, "Innerspeaker", was released on 21 May 2010. In the U.K. its official release date was 28 June, however iTunes accidentally made it available to buy immediately (not pre-order) on 12 May. The album was released in the United States on 8 June to general and critical acclaim. Pitchfork named it Best New Music.
In an interview with Triple J talking about the album's recent nomination for the J Award, Parker stated that they have secretly been recording a new album. "Jay and I have been recording pretty compulsively and album number two is nearing potential completion already and I'm so excited about it that I'm having trouble keeping myself from telling you all about it." This came as a big surprise as this statement was released only months after their debut album, "Innerspeaker", was released.
The band was busy touring during mid-2010, with their 'Innerspeaker album tour' commencing on 13 May 2010, as the opening band for MGMT's 2010 American tour. The band returned to Australia to play at Splendour in the Grass festival, which was followed by a European Tour in July (including an appearance at the Reading Festival) and a national Australian tour in October. In November they returned to the UK and Europe for a fifteen date tour, including their largest London headline show to date which was attended by Noel Gallagher, Tom Meighan, Sergio Pizzorno, Noel Fielding, Alexa Chung and Alison Mosshart, the band then went on to the United States and Canada for twenty headline dates including sold out shows in Toronto, New York, LA and San Francisco. They also received four 2010 ARIA Music Awards nominations which include, 'Album of the Year' and 'Best Rock Album' for "Innerspeaker", 'Best Group' and also 'Breakthrough Artist'.
On 29 November 2010, "Innerspeaker" won Australian youth-oriented radio network Triple J's highest honor, winning the J Award for Album of the Year.
"Lonerism".
On 7 December 2011, Parker began mixing the second Tame Impala album, "Lonerism", with producer Dave Fridmann. On 2 March 2012, Tame Impala posted via Facebook that the new album was "finished, mixed, mastered, mooged, broinged, and beeped". Jay Watson expected it to be released in mid-2012, but it was later released in October 2012.
Parker said that "Lonerism" "represents a departure from his previous work by incorporating an expanded sonic palette, more emotional song writing, and a more pronounced narrative perspective." It was created in a similar set up as "Innerspeaker", whereby Parker wrote and recorded the majority of the album by himself at his home in Perth, Australia. Parts of the recording also occurred in Parker's home studio in France.
While in France, Parker produced and played on the self-titled dream pop album by Melody's Echo Chamber, the project of French singer Melody Prochet. As a result, one of the tracks on "Lonerism" is titled "Endors Toi", which roughly translates from French to English as "fall asleep". The album cover is a photo taken by Parker of the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris, France, with additional editing by Leif Podhajsky, a graphic designer who created the album art for "Innerspeaker". The image ties into the themes of isolation of "Lonerism", with a metal gate separating the viewer from the people in the Gardens.
On 27 June 2012, the band released an album teaser on their Facebook page. The band released the song "Apocalypse Dreams" for free download on 7 July 2012. The first single "Elephant" was released in July 2012. The album was released on 5 October in Australia, 8 October in the United Kingdom and 9 October in the United States. StillinRock described it as the best album of the year. The album features the songs "Apocalypse Dreams" and "Elephant", which are some of the first songs that Parker has co-written with Watson. "Feels Like We Only Go Backwards" was released as the second single.
In November 2012, "Lonerism" won the 2012 J Award for Australian Album of the Year for the second time, after also winning it for their debut album "Innerspeaker" in 2010. They are the first band to win the J Award more than once. In January 2013, "Lonerism" was selected by "Rolling Stone" for the 2012 Album of the Year award after the band also won the award in 2011 for "Innerspeaker". It was also announced as album of the year by UK magazine "NME". Additionally, "Lonerism" was voted number 1 overall in "Rolling Stone", Triple J, "NME", "Filter", Urban Outfitters, FasterLouder and Obscure Sound's 2012 Album of the Year polls. "Elephant" and "Feels Like We Only Go Backwards" appeared at number 7 and 9 respectively in Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2012.
The band began an international tour in 2012 through 2013, supported by The Growl. During this tour, they played major festivals, such as Coachella, Sasquatch Festival, and appeared on "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon".
In September 2012, Tame Impala's first US feature appeared on the cover of the publication "The FADER", in its 82nd issue. "Elephant" was used in advertisements for the Blackberry Z10, in the second season finale of the HBO show "Girls", and in the film "The Fifth Estate".
On 18 May 2013, it was announced via Facebook that Allbrook would leave the band to focus on other musical endeavors, and that Cam Avery of Pond and The Growl would take his place. Allbrook played his final gig with the band on their last Australian tour date of 2013 at Perth's Belvoir Amphitheatre, the same venue that Allbrook played his first gig with the band at in 2008. As a farewell gesture, the band played a cover of Outkast's "Prototype".
Alongside albums by bands such as Vampire Weekend and Nine Inch Nails, "Lonerism" received a 2014 Grammy Award nomination in December 2013 in the Best Alternative Music Album category.
Musical style.
Parker's music is heavily influenced by psychedelic rock, which is achieved through various production methods. Some favoured and often-used effects by Parker include phasing, delay, reverb and fuzz.
Parker's decision to make the music for Tame Impala in the studio by himself is a result of Parker liking "the kind of music that is the result of one person constructing an awesome symphony of sound. You can layer your own voice 700 times for half a second if you want, and I just love that kind of music." However, Parker has to translate his music to a live setting with the band, and the band doesn't play the songs until they have been recorded. "The only jamming that’s done as a band is done a long time after the song is recorded for the sake of the live environment. It’s good for us, because we can take a song that’s been recorded and do what we want to it: slow it down, speed it up, make it 10 seconds or 10 minutes long. It gives us a lot of freedom."
Experimentation with different effects pedals has led to Parker creating new and unique sounds. "If you make an effort to not put the pedals in the order you're meant to, then you'll end up with something new sounding. We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used." "People have a distortion pedal and then a reverb pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. If you put it the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded. You can do different things just by treating things differently."
Parker also has a strong sense of melody in his music, having composed "excessively melodic music from about the age of 12 to 15". As a result of Parker's love of melody, he also has revealed that he has a "fetish for extremely sugary pop music" from artists like Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue.
In addition to a love of melody, Parker also loves "fucked-up explosive cosmic music" in the vein of The Flaming Lips, whom Parker collaborated with on the track Children of the Moon in 2012, for the release "The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends".
Combining these two things, Shoegaze legends My Bloody Valentine have influenced Parker's music with their contrasting combination of loud guitars and ethereal melodies. Parker has "always been in love with the wall of sound as employed by My Bloody Valentine" and he tries to capture that "melancholy dreamy feel". Parker tries to incorporate this balance into his own music. "If I was singing, I wouldn't be able to match the tone of the instruments, which is really crunchy. The instruments are quite sonically brutal, but the voice is really soft, and I think that kind of resonates with people. It's kind of like My Bloody Valentine, where it's really brutal sounding, but kind of beautiful at the same time." Tame Impala live drummer Jay Waston has described Parker's music as containing "shoegazey guitar sound, but not played in a shoegazey manner".
Electronic music is another influence. Parker has used rock instrumentation in an electronic manner, saying "The way we do music, it's organic, but it's meant to be quite repetitive and hypnotic, almost in a kind of electronic nature. Using our playing as though it was a living sample." A heavy feature on "Innerspeaker" is a pitch-shifted guitar tone that many mistook for a synth. Parker mentioned this by saying "I had a few obsessions when recording "Innerspeaker". One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and 
drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound."
Parker was inspired to take up various creative endeavors at a young age, "I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used to get the most immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn’t actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad’s car or listening to him play guitar."
Parker's process for making music is "I’ll have a sudden, spontaneous vision of a song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and do my best to record it as quick as I can. I’ll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I’ll have a whole bunch of them and then I’ll just choose which ones to make into full songs." For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and it’s timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it’s not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story." Parker also said "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it’s me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It’s really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me."
Lo-fi music is also a favourite of Parker's, and he incorporated it heavily in the early days of Tame Impala, heard prominently on the "Tame Impala EP". With the release of "Innerspeaker", Parker went for a different approach to a lo-fi sound, aiming more for a more cosmic and sonic wall of sound, helped by mixer Dave Fridmann. Parker explained "It sounds more cohesive, like an organism. It has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different feeling when it’s absolutely blaring at you. I love that sound."
Parker has also stated that Supertramp are a major influence on the musical style of Tame Impala.

Region of Murcia

The Region of Murcia (, ; ; is an autonomous community of Spain located in the southeast of the country, between Andalusia and Valencian Community, on the Mediterranean coast.
The autonomous community consists of a single province, unlike most autonomous communities, which have several provinces within the same territory. Because of this, the autonomous community and the province are operated as one unit of government. The city of Murcia is the capital of the region and seat of government organs, except for the parliament, the Regional Assembly of Murcia, which is located in Cartagena. The autonomous community and province is subdivided into municipalities. 
The Region of Murcia is bordered by Andalusia (the provinces of Almería and Granada); Castile–La Mancha (the province of Albacete, which was historically connected to Murcia until 1980); the Valencian Community (province of Alicante); and the Mediterranean Sea. The community measures 11,313 km² and has a population of 1.4 million, of whom one-third live in the capital. The highest mountain is "Los Obispos" (2,015 m).
The region is a major producer of fruits, vegetables, and flowers for Spain and the rest of Europe. Wineries have developed near the towns of Bullas, Yecla, and Jumilla, as well as olive oil near Moratalla. Murcia is mainly a warm region which has made it very suitable for agriculture. However the precipitation level is low and water supply is a hot subject today since, in addition to the traditional water demand for crops, there is now also a demand of water for the booming tourist developments. Water is supplied by the Segura River and, ever since the 70's, by the Tajo transvasement, a major civil engineering which, under some environmental and sustainability restraints, brings water from the Tajo into the Segura.
Geography.
Relief.
The region is located in the eastern part of the "Cordilleras Béticas" mountains and it is influenced by their orography. These mountain ranges are divided as well in the "Prebética", "Subbética" and "Penibética" mountain ranges (from north to the south).
Traditionally it has been considered that the peak of "Revolcadores", in the range of the same name, was the highest point in the Region of Murcia, with a height of 2,027 meters; but in measurements of the most recent maps of the SNIG (National Service of Geographic Information of Spain), Revolcadores appears with a height of 1,999 m, and the mountain, "Los Obispos" ("The Bishops"), located slightly further north, is higher(2,015 m).
Approximately 27% of the Murcian territory can be described as mountainous, 38% as intramountainous depressions and running valleys, and the remaining 35% as flat lands and plateaux.
Climatology.
The Region of Murcia enjoys a Mediterranean climate of semi-arid type, with mild winters (an average of 11 °C in December and January) and warm summers (where the daily maximum regularly exceeds 40 °C). The average annual temperature is 18 °C.
With little precipitation of about 300 to 350 mm per year, the region has between 120 and 150 days in the year where the sky is totally clear. April and October are the months with the most precipitation, there being frequent heavy downpours in a single day.
The distance to the sea and the relief causes a thermal difference between the coast and the interior, specially in winter, when the temperature rarely descends below 10 °C on the coast, while in the interior regions the minimum does not usually rise above 6 °C and the precipitation level is higher (up to 600 mm).
The city of Murcia holds the record temperature of the 20th century in Spain. It reached 46.1 °C (115 °F) on July 4, 1994. The winter of 2005 was the coldest in a long time, with snow even falling on the Murcian coast. [http://www1.laverdad.es/interactivo/imagenes_galerias/nevadacostaene05/imagenes.htm]
Hydrography.
Rivers.
The hydrographic network of the region is made up of the Segura river and its affluents:
Due to the water supplying incapacity of the Segura river basin, contributions to this river basin are made, originated from the basin of the Tajo river, by means of the Tajo-Segura transvasement.
History.
The Carthaginians established a permanent trading port on the coast at Cartagena, which the Romans called Carthago Nova. For the Carthaginian traders, the mountainous territory was merely the Iberian hinterland of their seacoast empire. During The Roman period Murcia did not exist but its actual borders could have been inside of the province of Hispania Carthaginensis. Under the Moors, who introduced the large-scale irrigation on which Murcian agriculture depends, the province was known as Todmir; it included, according to Idrisi, the 11th century Arab cartographer based in Sicily, the cities of Orihuela, Lorca, Mula and Chinchilla, Spain.
The Kingdom of Murcia became independent as a "taifa" centered on the Moorish city of Murcia after the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba (11th century). Moorish Taifa of Murcia included Albacete and part of Almería as well. After the battle of Sagrajas in 1086 the Almoravid dynasty swallowed up the "taifas" and reunited Islamic Spain. Ferdinand III of Castile received the submission of the Moorish king of Murcia in 1243 under the terms of the Treaty of Alcaraz. 
In the usual way, the Muslims were evicted from the cities, and Ferdinand's heir Alfonso X of Castile, who benefited from rule over a largely depopulated Murcia, divided the border kingdom in three regions for administrative purposes, entrusted respectively to the "concejos de realengo", to the ecclesiastical "señores seculares", as a reward for their contributions to the Reconquista and to the Military Orders founded in the 11th century. Alfonso annexed the Taifa of Murcia as "King of Murcia" and "Señorio de Cartagena" outright in 1266, and it remained technically a vassal kingdom of Spain until the reforms in the liberal constitution of 1812. Murcia became an autonomous region in 1982.
The Castilian conquest of Murcia was significant because it gave the former access to the Mediterranean for the first time and ended the expansion of the Kingdom of Aragon which had been moving south along the coast.
Demography.
The Region of Murcia has a population of 1,424,063 inhabitants (INE 2008, National Statistic Institute of Spain), of which almost a third (30.7%) live in the municipality of Murcia. It makes up 3.0% of the Spanish population. In addition, after Ceuta and Melilla, Murcia has the highest population growth (5.52 by thousand inhabitants) and also the highest birth rate of the country.
In the 1991-2005 period the Murcian population grew at by 26.06%, as opposed to the national average of 11.85%. 12.35% of the inhabitants are of foreign origin, according to the INE 2005 census, which is 4% more than the Spanish average. The most notable groups of immigrants are Ecuadorians (33.71% of the total of foreigners), Moroccans (27.13%), Britons (5.95%), Bolivians (4.57%) and Colombians (3.95%).
Municipalities.
The Region of Murcia comprises 45 municipalities, the most populated being Murcia, Cartagena, Lorca, and Molina de Segura.
Language.
The Spanish spoken in the region has its own accent and local words. The Murcian dialect tends to eliminate many syllable-final consonants and to emphasize regional vocabulary, much of which is derived from Aragonese, Catalan and Arabic words. The general intonation and some of the distinctive vocabulary of the Spanish dialect spoken in Murcia share several traits with the one spoken in the neighboring province of Almería, in Andalusia, and the Vega Baja del Segura in the Alicante province.
Valencian (Catalan) is spoken in a small area of the region known as El Carche.
Tourism.
Despite the famous seaside resorts, the overall region is relatively unknown even within Spain, so it continues to be relatively unspoilt compared to other more overcrowded areas of the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Nevertheless its more than 300 sunny days a year with an average temperature of 21 degrees Celsius, and the 250 km of beaches of the so-called Costa Cálida (Warm Coast) have attracted tourists for decades.
The region is also being promoted as a cultural destination with a lot of highlights for visitors: monuments, gastronomy, cultural events, museums, historic remains, festivals etc. The Region of Murcia is one of the Spanish autonomous communities that has grown the most in the last years, and this has conferred it the character of an ideal destination of services, shopping and for the organization of cultural events and conventions.
Cultural tourism.
The castles itinerary.
the interior of the region of Murcia has plenty of castles and fortifications showing the importance of these frontier lands between the Christian Castile and the Muslim Andalusia. They include:
Festivities.
Cartagena’s and Lorca’s Holy Week’s processions have been declared of International Tourist Interest, together the Murcia's "Bando de la Huerta" and "Burial of the Sardine", included in its Spring Festivities. Murcia’s Holy Week is also interesting since its processions include Murcian sculptor Francisco Salzillo's statues. 
Cartagena’s main festivities are the Carthagineses y Romanos, re-enacting the Punic Wars. They have been declared of National Tourist Interest.
The Águila’s Carnival is one of the most important and colourful of Spain.
Beaches and golf.
This is the most developed tourist resource in Murcia. The "Costa Cálida" has 250 km of beaches, from "el Mojón" at the North near Alicante to Águilas, South West Murcia, near Almería.
One of the major destinations of Murcia is the Mar Menor or "Small Sea", the largest natural lake of Spain and the largest salty lagoon in Europe, located by the Mediterranean. It is separated from the mediterranean by a 22 km narrow sandy strip known as La Manga del Mar Menor or simply "La Manga". It is probably the most developed and overcrowded holiday area of Murcia, despite being declared a Specially Protected Area of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMIs) by the United Nations. 
Mar Menor's muds are famous for its therapeutic properties. Apart from Mar Menor, the Murcian coast from the historical city of Cartagena to the frontier with Andalusia, that corresponds to the Mediterranean Sea alternates wild and unspoilt rocky areas with large sandy beaches, with the towns of Mazarrón and Águilas standing out.
The tourism needs have forced the area to add all kinds of facilities and services. The construction boom shows the huge amount of estates, including the controversial holiday resorts of Polaris World and second residences, as well as numerous malls. 
Thanks to the orography and climate of the region of Murcia, these lands are suitable for golf courses, a fact that has been very controversial because of the need for water, which Murcia lacks, being a very dry region. 
Other services includes nautical charters; yacht facilities; golf courses; adventure tourism companies; sports federations; tourist routes; guided visits and excursions by sea.
Natural resources and rural tourism.
The region of Murcia has 19 areas under different statutes of protection, representing 6% of its territory. 
Inner lands of the region, near the historical towns of Caravaca de la Cruz and Moratalla, offer a number of rural accommodations and facilities: cottages, farmhouses, country houses and camp sites. Visitors can engage in activities related to excursions, day trips, sports, sightseeing.

Yassine El Ghanassy

Yassine El Ghanassy (born 12 July 1990) is a Belgian-Moroccan footballer who plays as a forward for the UAE League side Al Ain on loan from Gent.
Club career.
Youth career.
Yassine El Ghanassy was born on 12 July 1990 as the only son of the former football player Hajjaj El Ghanassy. He started playing when he was fifteen at the team Fayt-Manage in Hainaut. He was signed by the youth team of La Louvière, where he quickly gained the attention of many sides. At the age of sixteen, he went to the English team Birmingham City FC, impressing on trial, but a transfer didn't follow as La Louvière wanted a transfer price which was too high for such a young player.
La Louvière.
In 2008 El Ghanassy made his debut in the first team of La Louvière. The team had just been relegated to the Third Division and was about to merge with RACS Couillet. El Ghanassy got some playing time, but nevertheless left for AA Gent not long afterwards.
AA Gent.
Although he was initially added to the youth team, he played a number of games in the Jupiler Pro League. Thanks to his creativity and drive he was being named as the successor to Bryan Ruiz, who left in the summer of 2009 for FC Twente. Due to their similarities as players, he has been compared to Ruiz by many pundits.
In his early games for Gent, El Ghanassy became known as a fine passer of the ball, and one who provided many assists from his team-mates, but rarely scored himself. His first goal was scored in the Belgian League playoffs in 2009/10 against Zulte Waregem. Since that goal he has become more prolific. One of his most important contributions in recent years was a goals against the Belarusian team FC Naftan Novopolotsk in the Champions League qualifiers. It was the only goal in that game, which meant that Gent qualified for the third qualifying round.
More recently, El Ghanassy has been followed by several European top teams, with Manchester City F.C., AC Milan, Everton FC, RSC Anderlecht, Sunderland A.F.C. and Olympique Lyonnais being linked with the Belgian. He admitted recently that the attention of Anderlecht flattered him.
On 25 October 2010, it was revealed scouts from Celtic F.C. had watched El Ghanassy in action. His agent described him as a "magician" in an interview with STV, saying he would encourage the player to move to the Glasgow club.
West Bromwich Albion.
On the 11th July 2012 West Bromwich Albion confirmed the loan signing of Yassine El Ghanassy from Gent. El Ghanassy signed a season-long deal with an option to make the move permanent in West Bromwich Albion's favour. He scored his first goal for WBA against Yeovil in the League Cup on 28 August 2012.
SC Heerenveen.
On the 30th of January 2013 SC Heereveen announced that they have loaned Yassine El Ghanassy for the rest of the season.
International career.
Because of the fact that El Ghanassy has double Belgian-Moroccan nationality, he could choose to play for either country, leading to him playing International youth team games for both nations. 
El Ghanassy was called up by the national coach Georges Leekens to play in the Belgian national team on 8 October 2010 and to play his first international game. El Ghanassy made his debut for Belgium in a friendly match against Finland, and as a result, would still be eligible to play for Morocco.

I Am Wings

I Am Wings: poems about love is a young adult book of poetry by Ralph Fletcher, it was first published in 1994. It was chosen by School Library Journal as one of their best books of 1994.
Summary.
The book contains thirty-one free verse poems about love arranged into two sections, "Falling In" and "Falling Out". The poetic voice is that of a young male and the poems trace the development of a relationship from the beginning with the first poem "First Look" through its demise with the last poem "Seeds".
Reception.
Nancy Vasilakis in her review for Horn Book Magazine said that "The poems, which are easily accessible to younger adolescents, are a good bet for reluctant readers. They will strike home with most teenagers, who'll recognize the feelings expressed here and will appreciate a volume of poetry written entirely in their own language." Patti Sylvester Spencer in her review for The Book Report said "Fletcher's language invites thought through accessible metaphors and meaningful situations relevant to toe contemporary youth." Judy Greenfield in her review for School Library Journal said that "while this book tells a story that has been told before, it does so with fresh images and without clichés." Susan Helper in her review for Reading Today said that "Fletcher deftly captures the kinds of discoveries adolescents make, their tentative explorations of unfamiliar emotions, and the quickness that their emotions change. Rachel E. Schwedt and Janice DeLong in their book "Young Adult Poetry" said this about the poems, "all are masterfully written and nearly take away the breath of anyone who has ever been in love. These responsive poems are certain to draw passionate discussion and possibly unlock real creative writing among young adults."

Kurt August Viktor Weyher (30 August 1901 – 17 December 1991) was a Konteradmiral of the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) who, during World War II, commanded a merchant raider. Material on the command of the raider "Orion" was published online at [http://www.bismarck-class.dk/hilfskreuzer/orion.html].
Weyher was heavily decorated during his active lifetime and progressed to Konteradmiral (equivalent to Rear Admiral) during the war, so he seems to have been an effective officer at the least.
Although it was not mentioned in his book "The Black Raider", it seems that Weyher was a non-trivial painter; in a feature article author Keith Gordon tells that on the voyage of the "Orion" Weyher did about 30 paintings on subjects connected with the ship's activities. The one painting illustrated seems to have had narrative merit and to have represented the topographic background recognisably.

Altica is a large genus of flea beetles in the subfamily Galerucinae, with about 300 species, distributed nearly worldwide. The genus is best represented in the Neotropic region, well represented in the Nearctic and Palearctic, but occurs also in the Afrotropic, Indomalaya and Australasia. The species are similar to each other, small metallic blue-green-bronze beetles, often distinguished from each other only by the aedeagus. The species of "Altica", both as larvae and as adults, are phytophagous, feeding on plant foliage of various food plant taxa, specific for each "Altica" species. Onagraceae and Rosaceae (mainly "Rubus") are the dominant host plant families for Holarctic species. The adult "Altica" beetles are able to jump away when approached.

The Church of Panagia Paraportiani (Greek: Εκκλησία της Παναγίας της Παραπορτιανής) is situated in the neighbourhood of Kastro, in the town of Chora, on the Greek island of Mykonos. Its name literally means "Our Lady of the Side Gate" in Greek, as its entrance was found in the side gate of the entrance to the Kastro area.
The building of this church started in 1425 and was not completed until the 17th century. This impressive, whitewashed church actually consists of five other churches attached all together: the four churches (Saint Estathios, Saint Sozon, Saints Anargyroi and Saint Anastasia) are all on the ground and constitute the base of the fifth church that has been built on top of them. This architectural spottiness has made Panagia Paraportiani the most photographed church on Mykonos.

Aumann's agreement theorem

Aumann's agreement theorem says that two people acting rationally (in a certain precise sense) and with common knowledge of each other's beliefs cannot agree to disagree. More specifically, if two people are genuine Bayesian rationalists with common priors, and if they each have common knowledge of their individual posteriors, then their posteriors must be equal.
A question arises whether such an agreement can be reached in a reasonable time and, from a mathematical perspective, whether this can be done efficiently. Scott Aaronson has shown that this is indeed the case.
Of course, the assumption of common priors is a rather strong one and may not hold in practice. However, Robin Hanson has presented an argument that Bayesians who agree about the processes that gave rise to their priors (e.g., genetic and environmental influences) should, if they adhere to a certain "pre-rationality condition", have common priors.
Studying the same issue from a different perspective, a research paper by Ziv Hellman considers what happens if priors are not common. The paper presents a way to measure how distant priors are from being common. If this distance is ε then, under common knowledge, disagreement on events is always bounded from above by ε. When ε goes to zero, Aumann's original agreement theorem is recapitulated.
In a 2013 paper, Joseph Halpern and Willemien Kets argued that "players can agree to disagree in the presence of ambiguity, even if there is a common prior, but that allowing for ambiguity is more restrictive than assuming heterogeneous priors."

CEEQUAL was developed by a team led by the ICE, with government financial support from the DETR and DTI Partners in Innovation schemes, and from the ICE's Research & Development Enabling Fund. 
The development of CEEQUAL was managed by Crane Environmental Ltd, and received support and participation from relevant government departments and agencies, professional and industry associations, and civil engineering consultants and contractors.
Following industry-wide consultation and trialling, the scheme was launched in September 2003 and the first eight Awards presented at the ICE.
Since then, CEEQUAL has become the UK industry scheme for assessing environmental and sustainability performance in civil engineering and public realm projects, and is now widely used by major civil engineering clients, designers and contractors. In June 2008 CEEQUAL was recognised by HM Government's report, "Strategy for Sustainable Construction" as an initiative helping to 'drive forward' the Government’s design agenda for civil engineering and infrastructure projects. The total construction value of all projects assessed or in process of being assessed under CEEQUAL reached the £6 billion mark in autumn 2008.
How CEEQUAL Works.
The scheme uses a points-scoring-based assessment, which is applicable to any civil engineering or public realm project. The scheme is made up of 200 questions within the CEEQUAL Manual relating to environmental and social aspects of a project such as the use of water, energy and land, impacts on ecology, landscape, neighbours, archaeology, as well as waste minimisation and management, and community relations and amenity. Awards are made to projects in which the clients, designers and constructors have gone beyond the legal and environmental minima, to achieve distinctive environmental standards of performance.
Project assessments are self-assessments carried out by an Assessor from within any part of a project team, or contracted in, who must have been trained by CEEQUAL. CEEQUAL also appoints a trained Verifier to the project, who is independent of the project team and acts to support the Assessor and provide validation of the completed assessment and subsequent Award.
The first step involves the Assessor and Verifier agreeing which questions are not relevant to the project and should be scoped out. The project is then assessed against the remaining question set. The Assessor completes the assessment by gathering the appropriate supporting evidence and completing a Scoring Spreadsheet. This is then submitted to the Verifier, together with the supporting evidence, for review and approval. Once the Veriﬁer is satisﬁed with the assessment, the Scoring Spreadsheet is submitted to CEEQUAL for ratification, and a CEEQUAL Award certiﬁcate is issued.
There are several different CEEQUAL Award levels that a project can achieve, depending on the percentage number of points scored against the scoped-out question set. These are:
Award Types.
Five types of award can be applied: 
For larger or long-term projects an Interim (Client & Outline Design) Award is assessed en route to a final Whole Project Award.
The Manual.
The "CEEQUAL Assessment Manual for Projects" contains the 200 questions that comprise the CEEQUAL scheme and against which projects are assessed. The Manual also contains background information and references, guidance on scoring and scoping out, and examples of what is considered appropriate evidence. The question set is split into the following 12 topic areas:
In November 2008, Version 4 of the CEEQUAL Manual was launched. This provided a significant update to previous versions, including new questions specifically targeting carbon emissions and whole-life-cycle carbon analysis.
The CEEQUAL Manual should be read in conjunction with the "Scheme Description and Process Handbook", which introduces the process of a CEEQUAL assessment and acts as a 'how to' guide for the Manual.

Against Eratosthenes

Against Eratosthenes is a speech by Lysias, one of the ten Attic orators. In the speech, Lysias accuses Eratosthenes, a member of the Thirty Tyrants who ruled Athens following the Peloponnesian War, of the murder of his brother, Polemarchus (around 403 BCE). 
Overview.
Lysias’s career as a speech writer, or logographer, was interrupted by the occupation of the Thirty Tyrants, an oligarchic junta placed in power by the Spartans following their victory against Athens in the Peloponnesian War, which ended in 404 BCE. Lysias, along with a small group of fellow metics, including his brother, Polemarchus, were arrested by the pro-Spartan regime on charges of general hostility and resistance to the Thirty Tyrants. According to Lysias, the group was arrested on trumped up charges just so the Thirty Tyrants could have a reason to confiscate their substantial wealth and property. The subsequent execution of Polemarchus is one of the subjects of the speech. Eratosthenes was a member of the Thirty Tyrants who oversaw the arrest of Lysias, Polemarchus, and their fellow metics. The speech was written following the collapse of the oligarchy and the restoration of democracy in Athens in 403 BCE.
Lysias's speech.
Considered to be among the most famous of his works, Lysias is both the author and the speaker in the speech. Upon the restoration of democracy in Athens, a general amnesty was granted to protect the former members of the oligarchy. This amnesty meant that the officials of the oligarchic government were protected from prosecution from acts they committed before the democratic government was restored except in cases where they personally committed a murder. The members of the Thirty Tyrants were not granted amnesty until they successfully defended themselves at their "euthunai", a process in which government officials account for their actions that took place during their terms. 
It is unclear whether this speech was delivered at Eratosthenes's "euthunai," at a separate homicide trial, or at all. Regardless of when or in what form the speech took place, Lysias’s argument consists of two distinct sections: a general attack on Eratosthenes and the other members of the Thirty Tyrants pointing out their collective corruption before and after the pro-Spartan regime was installed and a cross-examination of Eratosthenes himself. During his cross-examination, Eratosthenes makes a very similar argument that the Nazi defendants made at the Nuremberg Trials. Eratosthenes maintained that he was simply following the orders of his superiors and that he personally did not command much authority.
Uncertain outcome.
Unfortunately, no evidence exists for the outcome of the trial, or, again, for whether the speech was ever actually delivered. As a non-citizen, Lysias would not have been able to deliver the speech himself in court. Some scholars believe that Lysias wrote the speech hypothetically and circulated it in a pamphlet just to voice his opinions on the matter.
It is also suggested, however, that Lysias was granted citizenship by the democracy for a period after the 30 were expelled, in which case he could have delivered his own speech in the court.

George Brown (Sussex cricketer, born 1783)

George Brown (27 April 1783, Stoughton, Sussex – 25 June 1857, Sompting, Sussex) was an English professional cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1819 to 1838.
A right-handed batsman and fast underarm bowler who played for Hampshire and Sussex, he made 51 known appearances in first-class matches. He represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series.
Brown was credited with 89 wickets in his career (i.e., bowled only) with a best return of six in one innings. He had a reputation for extreme pace and was widely known as "Brown of Brighton". He is said, though the story may be apocryphal, to have once killed a dog when a ball he had bowled went past the stumps and through a coat held by the longstop, hitting the dog which was behind the coat. Another of his longstops, a man called Dench, insisted on fielding with a sack of straw tied to his chest for protection. E H Budd played against both Brown and Walter Marcon, who had a similar reputation, and Budd said that "Brown was not more terrific in his speed than Marcon", an elaborate way of saying that they were both extremely fast. Brown was a useful batsman and made 1053 runs at 11.44 with a top score of 70 which he scored during the first of the three roundarm trial matches. He died in Sompting, Sussex.

Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh Dhanju

Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh Dhanju (1875 – Feb 20, 1921) played an important role in awakening the Sikh masses during Gurdwara Reform Movement in the early quarter of 20th century as also for the liberation of Sikh Gurdwaras from the corrupt Mohants. He is the leading Sikh figure among the list of Sikh martyrs who struggled for and volunteered the liberation of Gurdwara Nankana Sahib from the clutches of Mahant Narain Das on February 20, 1921. The supreme sacrifices made by Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh and his other companions have been acknowledged by the grateful Sikh nation. From that day onwards, the Sikh nation remembers these brave Sikhs in their daily ardas (prayer). Every year on 21 February at this Shaheedi Asthan, Guru Granth Sahib's "Swaroop" with Bullet marks is brought to Deewan (assembly hall) from 2pm to 4pm for darshan of the Sikh Sangat.
Family background and early life.
Bhai Tehal Singh was born on Diwali Night of 1875, Dhanju Kamboj family of village Nizampur, District Amritsar. His father was Sardar Chanda Singh Dhanju and mother Sardarani Rukman Kaur Dhanju. The family moved to Chak No 38, Village Nizampur Deva Singh Wala, District Sheikhupur during the colonization of Lower Chenab Bar in the early years of 19th century. Bhai Tehal Singh went to Malaya in 1902 and for some time he worked as watchman in Kualalumpur but had to return to India in 1909 due to some family issue. He again left for Malaya in 1911 but due to death of his father in 1915, he had to come back again in 1915.
In the cause of Sikhism.
Soon after his second return from Malaya, Bhai Tehal Singh took Amrit-pan and jumped into the Sikh Gurdwara Reform Movement. He played a very active role to awaken the migrant Sikh farmers of the Canal Colony, Sheikhupura, and spread the message of Sikh Gurus in numerous villages around Nizampur Deva Singh Wala. He participated in the Political Conference of Dharowal as well as in the Movement started by the Sikh Community to liberate Gurdwara Sacha Sauda Chuharkana and Gurdwara Tarn Taran from the control of Mohants. Bhai Tehal Singh had joined the squad which went to liberate Gurdawara Tarn Taran from the Mahant control on January 26, 1921 and was badly injured in the brick-bats thrown at the Jatha volunteers by the pujaris. He also volunteered in the morcha launched by Sikhs in connection with Gurdwara Rikab Ganj wall in Delhi.
Libration of Gurdawara Nankana Sahib.
But his most active and memorable contribution is noticeable in the liberation of Gurdawara Nankana Sahib from Mahant Narain Dass. On January 24, members of the Akali Dal including Master Tara Singh, Harbans Singh Attari, Master Sundar Singh Lyallpuri, Teja Singh Samundari, Harchand Singh, Kartar Singh Jhabbar, Bhai Dalip Singh Lyallpuri, Jaswant Singh Jhabal, Sardul Singh Kavishar etc. convened a meeting in the "Akali" office, Lyallpur and decided to hold a "Panthik Diwan" on March 4, 5, and 6, 1921 in Nankana to take control of the Gurdawara complex from Mahant Narain Das. The Akali leaders got the news through their detectives that the Mahant had devised a murderous plan to invite the Akali leaders at Gurdawara Nankana Sahib on March 5 and have them all killed. This news incensed the Sikhs greatly. To foil Mahant's foul designs, hot-blooded Sikh leaders including Jathedar Kartar Singh Jhabbar, Bhai Buta Singh Lyallpuri, Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali, Bhai Tehal Singh Nizam Deva Singh wala etc. held a meeting on February 17, 1921 at Gurdawara Sacha Sauda and decided to lead a Shaheedi Jatha to Gurdawara Nankana Sahib on February 29, 1921 and seize its control from the Mahant prior to the "Panthik Diwan". The planning to send Bhai Buta Singh Lyallpuri directly to Nankana Sahib on February 19, 1921, while two Jathas would be organized under Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali and Bhai Kartar Singh Jhabbar which would meet and unite into a single Jatha at Chandar kot jhal on February 19, 1921 (evening). From there onwards the unified Jatha would proceed to Nankana Sahib in the pal of night and reach Gurdawara Nankana Sahib early morning (nectral hours) of February 20 and seize control of the Gurdawara. 
Enthused and imbued by the spirit to do something for the Sikh Panth, Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh extensively toured numerous villages of Chak No 80, No 38, No 18 and No 10 comprising Nizampur Deva Singh Wala, Mula Singh Wala, Chelewala, Dalla Chand Singh, Thothian, Dhanuwal, Bohoru etc. which were all inhabited by the Kamboj colonists from district Amritsar. He was able to collect a Jatha (squad) of about 150 Sikh recruits, majority of whom from the Kamboj community of the region. This Jatha was merged with the Jatha of 23 Sikhs brought by Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali. After performing Ardas (Sikh prayer) on February 19, 1921, the combined Jatha set on march towards Gurdawara Nankana Sahib under overall commandership of Jathedar Lachhman Singh Dharowali. When the Jatha reached Chandar kot jhal, some among the volunteers decided to stop and wait for the other Jatha from Jathedar Kartar Singh Jhabbar to join as decided in on February 17 meeting. At this very moment, Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh thrust himself forward saying: ""Dear Khalsa ji, we don’t want to wait for anybody. We have taken our resolve at the prayer (Ardaas) and it is imperative for us to move forward now."". The Jatha resumed its journey thence-afterwards following Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh and continuing its onwards march reciting Shabad Gurbani all through the night. On February 20, 1921, early morning when the Jatha had just entered the outer skirts of Nankana City near Brick-kilns (Bhattha), Chaudhury Pal Singh Layalpuri brought and conveyed message from Bhai Dalip Singh Sangla to Jathedar Lachhman Singh Dharowali urging him to suspend the march. Chaudhury also gripped Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh from behind to stop him. Jathedar Lacchman Singh had great regard for Bhai Dalip Singh Sangla and thus agreed to disband the Jatha but Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh once again thrust himself to pull Chaudhury Pal Singh away from Jathedar Lachhman Singh’s body and spoke thus: "“Khalsa ji, it is time not to stop but to move now. We started from our homes with commitments made under Ardas (prayer) to achieve martyrdom. It is very un-Singh-like to suspend the march and return home...Today is also very special day for us since it coincides with the birth day of Guru Har Rai ji who, though possessed army and weapons, yet did not use them in spite of numerous provocations from his enemies...The worst the Mahant could do is kill us, but who is afraid of death?”". And he further reminded the volunteers to remain peaceful and avoid any provocation and act of retaliation. 
Enthused by the speech of Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh, the entire Shaheedi Jatha including Jathedar Bhai Lacchamn Singh Dharowali resumed the march following Bhai Tehal Singh. At about 5.00 AM when the Jatha was quite close to the Gurdawara complex, another horseman messenger, Bhai Waryama Singh (Ram Singh?), arrived with letter from the Akali leadership. In vain did he too try to persuade Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh and the Jatha to return. Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh continued to lead the Jatha and walk towards the Gurdwara. Bhai Lachhman Singh and others repeatedly requested him to relent, but determined Bhai Tehal Singh stuck to his Ardas. The Jatha soon entered Darshni Deohri of the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib at about 6.00 AM, February 20, 1921. While some of the devotees from death squad took their seats inside the "Prakash Asthan", others sat on the platform and the Baran dari. Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali sat on Guru’s ’Taabiya’ (Behind Guru Granth Sahib). 
The Mahant had got the news of the Jatha's arrival at Chander kot on the 19th February evening. He had gathered his men at night and briefed them about their duties. After the Jatha had sat down, the Mahant signaled his men to carry out the predetermined plan. They closed the main gate and started firing from roof tops. Twenty-six Singhs became martyrs to those bullets in the courtyard while another sixty or so sitting inside the Darbar Sahib became targets of bullets. When the Mahant's men saw no one moving, they came down with swords and choppers. Any Singh they found breathing was cut to pieces. Thus 86 Jatha Singhs including Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh of Nizam Deva Singh Wala and Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh of Dharowali achieved supreme martyrdom for the glory of the Sikh Panth. Next day, February 21, 1921, Mr King, Commissione4r Lahore handed over the keys of the Gurdawara complex to Sardar Harbans Singh. Thus, the peaceful Sikhs had won a decisive and glorious battle against the corrupt Mahant backed by powerful British Imperialist bureaucracy.
Statistics on fatalities.
There are different versions on number of fatalities in this holocaust. Some writers put the death figures at 120, 150 or even 200. The government reports placed the death figures at 126. Police inspector Bachan Singh had put the number at 156. The report by Nankana Sahib Committee published in "Shaheedi Jeewan" however, placed the deaths at 86 and also listed the strength of the Shaheedi Jatha at 200. It seems that, besides Shaheedi Jatha Singhs, many non-participant devotees and others staying within Gurdwara also fell victims to Mahant's barbarism.

The school is well known for its exceptional achievement in standardised examinations; Penilaian Menengah Rendah and Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia. The school is widely known as Hillcrest and the students of Hillcrest bear the name Hillcrestians
History.
The school construction was started in 1989 and the first block was completed in 1991, hence opening its doors to the pioneer batch of students on 1 December 1990. The school area was originally an estate of 8.2 hectares. The school was named Hillcrest, by the Gombak Prefecture Education Office, after the developing company that have developed the neighborhood that the school is intended to serve, the Taman Seri Gombak neighborhood; Hillcrest Garden Sdn Bhd
Encik Irwan Tan Abdullah, who was the then-senior assistant, was elected as the first acting-principal on 1 December 1992. The first principal is Puan Sukma Murni Bt Abdul Samad. During that time, only the Munsyi building is in operation and the other building, the Sri Lanang building was still under construction. Kajai building was officially completed in 1996. With the operation of the new building, the school now have a Kemahiran Hidup Lab (Life Skills Labs), three science labs and another two new classrooms in operation.

Union of Working Youth

Union of Working Youth (, DISZ) was a mass youth organization in Hungary. All Hungarian youth between 14 and 26 years were allowed to become members. As of 1956, DISZ had 14 000 local organizations and a total membership of around 800 000. During its existence, DISZ oversaw the pioneer movement in Hungary.
DISZ published "Szabad ifjúság" weekly from October 1950 to July 1951, and daily from August 1951 to October 1956.
Within DISZ oppositional tendencies emerged. DISZ set up the 'Petőfi Circle', which became a centre of dissidence against the Hungarian government.
After the dissolution of DISZ, the Hungarian Young Communist League (KISZ) was set up. Unlike DISZ, KISZ was a cadre organization.

Bovista dermoxantha

Bovista dermoxantha is a small, white, nearly round puffball, recognized when young by a cottony-felty outer surface that becomes inconspicuously warted, eventually leaving fine, pallid, scales on an ochre to brown endoperidium. "Bovista plumbea" is similar, but has a smoother surface when young, and lacks a basal mycelial cord. In age it is distinguished by a dull greyish endoperidium. Large specimens of "Bovista dermoxantha" may also be mistaken for "Bovista pila". Both have a mycelial cord attachment to the substrate, but "Bovista pila" differs in releasing spores through tears or splits in the endoperidium rather than by an apical pore.
Description.
The fruiting body of the sporocarp is 1.5-3.0 (4.0) cm broad, subglobose, and attached to the substrate by a white mycelial cord. The exoperidium, which is white, felty, and shrivels in age, leaving buff to light-brown, grows up to 1.0 mm thick. There are furfuraceous scales or low warts on the endoperidium, which consists of a thin, membranous, ochre-brown to medium-brown layer, opening via a ragged apical pore. The gleba is soft, white, and becomes yellowish-olive to olive-brown, and finally to medium-brown at maturity. The subgleba and sterile base are absent. It has an undistinctive odor and taste. Although they are small, they are too small to be considered for an ordinary meal.
Habitat.
The "Bovista dermoxantha" is solitary, scattered, and clustered on disturbed ground. For example, they can be found on pastures, playing fields, edges of woods, roads, and paths. At low elevations, they are widely distributed, and fruit during the summer in watered areas and throughout the mushroom season. Though they are common, they are inconspicuous and easily overlooked.
Spores.
Spores are 3.5-4.5 µm in diameter, globose, thick-walled, and smooth to faintly warted. In addition, they have a central oil droplet and stub-like pedicel, and a sparsely branched thin capillitium. The pits are variable, consisting of absent to abundant.
As with most "Bovista", the spore release through the small apical pore.
Observations.
The relationship between temperature and fruit body emergence in summer in three fairy ring pathogens of basidiomycetes, "Bovista dermoxantha", "Vascellum curtisii" and "Conocybe lactea", on turf was examined using the method developed to predict the timing of emergence in pest insects. The number of fruit bodies at the turf study site in Chiba, Japan, was recorded together with average temperature at the weather station from 1999 to 2003. The lower theoretical developmental thresholds (the developmental zeros) for mycelial growth in "B. dermoxantha", "V. curtisii" and "C. lactea" were estimated to be 14.6.DEG.C., 17.0.DEG.C. and 8.8.DEG.C., respectively, based on the linear relationships observed in the temperature ranges 5-35.DEG.C. The cumulative effect of average daily temperatures that exceeded the developmental zeros required for each fungus (total effective temperature) was assessed. The probits of the percentage of total fruit bodies against the total that emerged over the five-year period of the study correlated with the total effective temperature to give a ratio of contribution exceeded near 0.6. Similar correlations were also found between probits obtained from daily recordings of fruit body numbers in the observation plots under 170 m2 and total effective temperature. The observations of development in "B. dermoxantha" and "C. lactea" revealed that the average diameter and fruiting period of the fruit bodies was 11.5 mm and 5.8 days, and the average height and fruiting period were 36.8 mm and 1.8 days, respectively. One of the characteristics for these fungi is that they are short-lived.

Beulas

Beulas SAU is a Spanish-based coachbuilder. The company builds a range of coach bodies on a variety of chassis. Their products are sold throughout Europe.
History.
The company was established in 1934 by Ramón Beulas and Narcís Pujol in Arbúcies, a village in the Selva county of the province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. It was (after Indcar and Ayats) the third coachbuilding company to be founded in this small town, which offered the advantage of being in the midst of a densely forested area ("Selva" means "forest" in Catalan), useful since the bodyworks were still made of wood at the time. During the Spanish Civil War, Beulas built ambulance bodies for the army. For the next three decades, Beulas remained a small coachbuilder which hand-crafted each bodywork to order, making 6-10 per year. During the 1960s, the company grew steadily and components bagan to be standardized, allowing for an increase in production volume. In the 1970s and 1980s the company multiplied the size of the factory premises and introduced more modern designs, and in the 1990s they began their international distribution, first in Germany and the UK, and later in the rest of Europe. Today, Beulas has close to 270 employees, and produces around 310 vehicles a year.
In 2012 Beulas has made a restyling of all of his models excepting Gianino.
Chassis types.
Beulas coach bodies are known to have been built upon the following manufacturers' chassis types (some may have been discontinued):

Sasebo Naval District

Sasebo also contained the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, specializing mostly in destroyers and smaller warships; and its anchorage was one of the largest in Japan. The District encompassed anchorages at Imari and Hirado ports as well as the designated third echelon naval ports of Takeshiki (Tsushima), Kagoshima, Kuji (Amami-Ōshima), and Wakamatsu (Gotō Islands)
History.
The location of Sasebo facing China and Korea, and near the foreign treaty port of Nagasaki was recognized of strategic importance by the leaders of the early Meiji government and early Imperial Japanese Navy. In 1883, the then Lieutenant Commander Tōgō Heihachirō nominated what was a tiny fishing village as the ideal location for a naval base. With the formation of the navy in 1886, Japan was divided into five each with a headquarter . Sasebo was designated as the "Third Naval District" (第三海軍区, "dai-san kaigunku"), and its harbor was dredged, a breakwater constructed and docking, coaling and repair facilities for warships were established, and the military base was officially opened in 1889. To stress the importance of the base, Emperor Meiji made a personal inspection tour in 1890.
The base was connected to the rest of Japan by rail in 1898, and the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, which would eventually expand to become one of the largest shipyards in Japan for the construction of smaller warships, began operation in 1903. As with the other Naval Districts, Sasebo was intended to operate as independently as possible, and facilities included armories, production factories for torpedoes, naval mines and naval artillery (and associated ammunition), and also a naval hospital and training centers. In concept, the Naval District was similar to the United States Navy Sea Frontiers concept. the Naval District maintained a small garrison force of ships and Naval Land Forces which reported directly to the Guard District commander, and hosted detachments of the numbered fleets on a temporary assignment basis.
Sasebo was the closest ship repair facility for the Imperial Japanese Navy to the combat zones of the Russo-Japanese War and saw considerable activity during that conflict. 
In 1920, the Japanese navy established an air wing and a wireless communications center in 1922. In 1934, the "Tomozuru" capsized off Sasebo with loss of most of its crew, and leaving behind serious questions about the basic design of many Japanese warships.
In 1941, base facilities were expanded considerably for the Pacific War. The base also hosted a major portion of the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces. The Imperial Japanese Navy had some 60,000 people working in the dock yard and associated naval stations at the peak of World War II, outfitting ships, submarines and aircraft. 
However, most of the base was destroyed by American air raids on Japan on June 28, 1945. After the surrender of Japan, Sasebo was occupied by the U.S. Marine Corps' Fifth Division, and the Sasebo Naval District was formally abolished on November 30, 1945.
Part of the former base facilities is still in use by the United States Navy as the United States Fleet Activities Sasebo and by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. One of the former base structures is now a museum.

Ancylobothrys capensis (Oliv.) Pichon, or Wild Apricot, is a tangled, sprawling, multi-stemmed South African creeper of the Apocynaceae family.
It is evergreen, often scrambling over rocks and other plants. New growth is covered in velvety, reddish-brown hairs. When damaged it exudes copious amounts of white latex. The leathery leaves are broadly elliptic, simple, opposite and erect, with prominent venation on both surfaces. Flowers are fragrant, about 40mm diameter, brilliant white when open and pinkish in bud.
The round fruit are up to 50mm in diameter, khaki-green when immature, turning bright orange or yellow when ripe. The skin is thick, soft, brittle, and easily peeled. 3-4 seeds are embedded in a sweet and tasty acidic pulp.
The species is common and occurs in rocky areas, particularly on quartzites throughout KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Limpopo Province, North West Province and Botswana.

Todorka () is a massive peak in the Pirin Mountains of south-western Bulgaria. It is the only peak of the Todorka side ridge and has a summit elevation of 2746 m (9009 ft.) above sea level. Todorka is the 11th highest peak in Pirin and is made of granite, and although not rocky, it is steep. It is a relatively short crest with three peaks - Golyama (Big), Sredna (Middle) and Malka (Little) Todorka. Golyama Todorka is located to the north and viewed from the town of Bansko looks like a dramatic pyramid. There are several ski tracks from its slopes, and has been developed extensively since 2000 and is now a major ski area, with a lift-served summit of 2600 m (8530 ft). Bansko hosted World Cup races for the women in 2009and for the men in 2011.
Following the ridge to the southwest of Golyama Todorka is Sredna Todorka at 2706 m (8878 ft.) and to the southeast is Malka Todorka (2712 m, 8898 ft.). To the east of the cirque their form are situated the two lakes Todorini Ochi (Todora's eyes) which are part of the Vasilashki Lakes near which runs the route between the Vihren refuge and Demyanitsa refuge. To the west is the Banderitsa valley which makes a peculiar twist following the twist of the Todorka peak. That is the reason why the end of the valley lies invisible from Bansko. 
There is an impressive panorama from the peak. To the west can be seen Vihren and Kutelo, to the east is the Strazhite edge. To the south Kamenitsa rises above the other peaks. To the north in cloudless days there is a dramatic view to Bansko in which the streets and buildings are clearly visible.
Legends.
There are two legends about the name of the peak. The first one tells about the brave Bulgarian woman Todorka who the defended the Sinan fortress against the Turks during the Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars. She fought to the end and finally ran to the peak above the castle chased by the Turks, jumped into the abyss and died. According to the second legend a local girl named Todorka did not manage to persuade her father to marry to her beloved Vasil. She ran away from home, reached the peak and started to cry from which the two lakes Todorini Ochi were formed. Vasil searched for her in vain and in the end reached the nearby peak Vasilashki Chukar and threw himself in despair into the lake below (one of the Vasilashki Lakes).

Sitabuldi Fort

Sitabuldi Fort, site of the Battle of Sitabuldi in 1817, is located atop a hillock in central Nagpur, Maharashtra, India. The fort was built by Mudhoji II Bhonsle, also known as Appa Sahib Bhosle, of the Kingdom of Nagpur, just before he fought against the British East India Company during the Third Anglo-Maratha War. The area surrounding the hillock, now known as Sitabuldi, is an important commercial hub for Nagpur. To the south is Nagpur Railway Station and behind it is "Tekdi Ganapati", a temple of Ganesha. The fort is now home to the Indian Army's 118th infantry battalion.
Battle of Sitabuldi.
Sitabuldi Fort, a major tourist attractions in Nagpur, is situated on two hillocks: "Badi Tekri", literally meaning "big hill", and "Choti Tekri", meaning "small hill" in Hindi. The Sitabuldi hills, though then barren and rocky, were not entirely unoccupied. Tradition holds that Sitabuldi got its name from two Yaduvanshi brothers – Shitlaprasad and Badriprasad Gawali, who ruled the area in the 17th century. The place came to be known as "Shitlabadri", which during British rule became "Seetabuldee", and later assumed its current form, "Sitabardi" or "Sitabuldi". The Battle of Sitabuldi was fought in November 1817 on these hillocks between the forces of Appa Saheb Bhonsle of Nagpur and the British.
After the death of Shivaji on 3 April 1680, the Maratha Empire broke up into segments ruled by five families: the Peshwas of Satara, the Gaekwads of Baroda, the Holkars of Indore, the Scindias of Gwalior, and the Bhonsles of Nagpur. The Maratha confederacy, as the five families were known, was still a formidable force.
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Marathas tried to overcome the gradual supremacy of the East India Company, while the British prepared to suppress the Marathas. At the beginning of the 19th century, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the victorious British annexed territories of the Marathas.
Mudhoji II Bhonsle, also known as Appa Sahib, ascended the throne of Nagpur in 1816. On 23 November 1817, he told the British resident that he intended to receive a Khilat sent to him by the Peshwa which would make him Senapati of the Marathas. He requested that the resident should honour the occasion by his presence and that a salute should be fired in the British Cantonment. The British resident at Nagpur declined the request, and commented that as the British were then at war with the Peshwa, the request was highly offensive to the British government.
On 24 November 1817, Appa Sahib publicly received the Khilat and accepted the commission appointing him Senapati of the Maratha armies. He then mounted his elephant and addressed his principal Sardars. Surrounded by his troops, he proceeded to the camp at Sukhardara. The royal standard was displayed, the army drawn up, salutes fired from artillery stations, and nothing was omitted which could add to the pomp of the ceremony.
On the morning of 25 November 1817, communication between the residency and the city was prohibited. The resident Harakars were refused permission to carry a letter to the darbar and the markets were closed to English troops. The resident decided to delay taking any decisive measures. Towards noon of 25 November, a group of 2,000 Bhosla cavalry left their camp at Bokur, five miles north-east of the city, and approached the residency. The alarm had now spread to the market frequented by the people of the residency, which soon became almost deserted. All classes, both rich and poor, removed their families and property from the vicinity of Sitabuldi.
The resident now knew that an attack on the residency was imminent. He sent orders to Lieutenant Colonel Scott at about 2:00 pm to march immediately from his cantonment at Telankheri. The force arrived near the residency and occupied the twin hills of Sitabuldi. This movement was executed only just in time, as a large group of Arabs, hired as mercenaries by the Maratha army, were awaiting final orders to secure this position. A message was also sent to General Doveton to come immediately with the Second Division of the Army from Berar.
Battleground.
The high ground of Sitabuldi is rocky and devoid of trees, so it was not possible to dig any entrenchments on the two hills in the available time. Choti Tekri, the northernmost of the two hilocks, is lower in height, but was within musket range of Badi Tekri, so securing that ground was considered essential. The suburbs of the city came close to Choti Tekri.
Battle.
Badi Tekri was occupied by about 800 men under Lieutenant Colonel Scott. About 300 men of the 24th Regiment under Captain Saddle were posted on Choti Tekri with one 6-pounder gun. On the other side of the hill, the suburbs gave cover to the Maratha troops, especially the Arabs, who throughout the day on 26 November were gathering in large numbers. The Arabs began the battle in the evening by opening fire on Choti Tekri. The engagement lasted until the early hours of the morning, when it slackened somewhat. Several times during the night the Arabs tried to capture the hill. Although they were repulsed, they inflicted heavy casualties. Captain Saddle shot and killed. As the ranks of 24th Regiment were thinned, reinforcements were sent down from the 20th Regiment, who were occupying the upper hill. At dawn on 27 November, the British troops were still holding on in an isolated position. At 5:00 am, the few remaining men of the 24th Regiment, being utterly exhausted, were withdrawn. Their place was taken by the Residents Escorts, with orders to confine their defence to the summit of the lower hill. The fight continued until 9:00 the next morning, when the Arabs charged and captured the hill. They turned the captured gun against the higher hill position.
The Maratha Cavalry and Infantry closed in from all sides and prepared for a general assault. The Arabs broke into the huts of the English troops and ransacked them. Some Maratha cavalry entered the residency compound. Captain Fitzgerald, in command of three troops of Bengal Cavalry and some horsemen of the resident escorts, had been requesting permission to charge, but his request was repeatedly turned down. Seeing the impending destruction, he made a last request. "Tell him to charge at his peril", Colonel Scott replied. "At my peril be it", said Captain Fitzgerald. He and his troops then charged some of the enemy cavalry, killed some of their supporting infantry, and captured their two guns. When the infantry posted on the hill witnessed this exploit, they became freshly animated. Just then an explosion of ammunition took place amongst the Arabs on the lower hill. The British troops rushed forward and pursued the Arabs down the hill, took two of their guns, and returned to their position. The Arabs rallied with the intention of attempting to recover the lost ground. As they were getting ready to come up, a troop of cavalry under Colonel Smith charged around the base of the hill, attacked the Arabs in the flank, and dispersed them. The British troops now advanced from the hill, drove the infantry from the adjoining hills, and by noon the conflict was over. The British lost 367 killed and wounded, including 16 officers.
During the British Raj.
British soldiers who died in the battle of Sitabuldi were buried in graves in the fort. After their defeat in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Tipu Sultan's grandson, Nawab Kadar Ali, and eight of his associates were hanged on the ramparts of Sitabuldi fort. A mosque is maintained in the fort to mark the location of the hangings. The graves and mosque are maintained by the Indian Army as a mark of respect for the gallantry of all who died. A separate memorial has also been constructed to the soldiers who fell during the colonial period.
Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned in the fort from 10 April to 15 May 1923. King George V and Queen Mary of the United Kingdom gave audience to the people of Nagpur from the fort during their visit to British India. A pillar to commemorate the event stands in the fort. The royals were greeted by a huge crowd gathered at the area towards the present Nagpur Railway Station.
Current status.
The fort is now home to the Indian Army's 118th infantry battalion (Territorial Army) Grenadiers. The fort is opened for public on three days of the year: 26 January, 1 May (Maharashtra Day), and 15 August.

Kemistry & Storm were an English drum and bass DJ and recording duo of the 1990s. Along with Goldie, whom Kemistry (Kemi Olusanya) had introduced to the drum and bass scene in the early years of the decade, they founded the Metalheadz label in 1994. Appearing mainly on the club scene, recordings by the act include "", a mix album released in January 1999 as part of the independent label Studio !K7's DJ-Kicks series.
Recognized for being "some of the first women DJs to have a widely distributed album" in a "male-dominated genre of music", Kemistry and Storm met while at college in Northampton. They kept in touch as their lives diverged over the coming years, working in radiography and as a make-up artist respectively, and gave up their careers to begin DJing when both found themselves living in London in the early 1990s. With Goldie, they led Metalheadz for two-and-a-half years before leaving the label. The success of the DJ-Kicks album brought them opportunities to DJ internationally and has been described as "paving the way for other, younger, female DJs".
The duo's collaboration came to an end with the death of Kemistry in an unusual road accident in the early morning of 25 April 1999, while returning from a Kemistry & Storm gig in Southampton.

Good Times, Wonderful Times

Good Times, Wonderful Times is a 1965 anti-war film, the third feature-length film written, produced, and directed by independent American filmmaker Lionel Rogosin. It was produced in London, and made with the support of James "Jimmy" Vaughan and Tadeusz Makarczynski, who assisted in an extensive multi-year search for archival footage detailing the atrocities of war. 
Inspired by a deep sense of the danger of nuclear annihilation and the horrors of war, Rogosin traveled the world to gather rare undiscovered footage in the early 1960s. Brilliantly contrasting these images in all their brute horror with a trendy cocktail party in London, it is a powerful orchestration of moral issues that leaves each viewer face to face with his own responsibilities. Inspired by "Hiroshima Mon Amour", it pushes the use of historical images to the extreme, creating a chain reaction resulting in an emotional explosion of horror, awareness and hope.
Finishing the film in 1964 just as the Vietnam War was in full swing, Rogosin distributed it through his company Impact Films to an estimated one million students on U.S. campuses, making him proud to claim that he helped convince thousands of young men to resist the war.
In 2008 Lionel Rogosin's son Michael Rogosin produced and directed a 24-minute documentary entitled "Man's Peril" about its making, tracing the fascinating history and politics in a saga as daring and uncompromising as the story behind "Come Back, Africa". We discover how Rogosin and partner James Vaughan collected rare materials over a two-year period from war archives around the world despite enormous difficulties and financial pressures. Rare footage of fan Bertrand Russell filmed by Rogosin but unused in the final film is here rediscovered and shown in historical context, with a dialogue showing the deep concerns that united Rogosin and Russell, helping us discover a new dimension and facet of Rogosin as a forerunner of political thinking and humanity in cinema.

Expulsion (band)

Expulsion was a Death metal band from Vallentuna, Sweden that existed from 1988 to 1999. The band gained notability for being one of the earliest Swedish death metal bands, and that two of its members also played in black metal band Treblinka (later named Tiamat).
History.
In June 1988, the thrash metal band River’s Edge recorded the demo "Mind the Edge" with guest vocalist Johan Edlund from the band Treblinka. Stefan Lagergren (guitar) and Anders Holmberg (bass) continued River’s Edge as Expulsion simultaneously to Treblinka, and recorded two demo cassettes, "Cerebral Cessation" (1988) and "Veiled in the Mists of Mystery" (1989). Daniel Ekeroth claims Edlund “helped them out with guest vocals”. Edlund himself stated: "“I really don’t remember singing on any Expulsion demos, but I guess I did. Back then we hung out with Tomas Skogsberg at Sunlight Studios whenever a band was recording, and I probably did loads of guest appearances that I have forgotten about.”"
The band went on hold when Holmberg joined Tranquility and was reformed in 1991 by Lagergren and Fransson after leaving Tiamat, together with Fredrik Thörnqvist on vocals and Chelsea Krook on bass. Holmberg returned and replaced Krook on the debut 7” "A Bitter Twist of Fate" that was recorded and released by the band themselves (under the record label alias Dödsmetallfirma Expulsion) in 1993.
The debut album "Overflow" was released in 1994. Ekeroth claims Johan Edlund was also involved as a guest vocalist on this recording.
The second album "Man Against" followed in 1996. Although never on any tour, the band played concerts together with bands as At The Gates, Grave, Tiamat, Dismember and Nihilist.
After ten years without any success the band split up in 1998. For a brief period, the members switched vocalist from Thörnqvist to Andreas Jansson under the name Judge And Jury, but ultimately split up in 1999.
Musical style.
On the first two demos, Expulsion “sounded like a thrashier Treblinka”, both bands containing Stefan Lagergren and Anders Holmberg and “sound pretty similar”.
Expulsion have often cited the bands Xecutioner, Athetist and Sadus as prime inspirations to start a death metal band. The combination of these influences, and the slower, doomier, bands such as Candlemass and Paradise Lost formed the basis of Expulsion's sound.

Germany–Slovakia relations

German–Slovak relations are foreign relations between Germany and Slovakia. Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1993 but previously had relations during World War II when Slovakia was a separate state. Germany has an embassy in Bratislava. Slovakia has an embassy in Berlin, an embassy branch in Bonn, a general consulate in Munich. Germany plays an important part in the Slovak economy as it is Slovakia's main trading partner.
Both countries are full members of NATO and of the European Union.
History.
World War II.
During World War II, Slovakia was an ally of Nazi Germany as part of the Axis. The Slovak Republic under President Josef Tiso signed the Tripartite Pact on November 24, 1940. Slovakia had been closely aligned with Germany almost immediately from its declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia on March 14, 1939. Slovakia entered into a treaty of protection "Schutzvertrag" with Germany on March 23, 1939. This treaty aligned Slovakia's foreign and defence policies with Germany, and allowed German troops to form a protection zone in the western parts of Slovakia.
Slovak troops joined the German invasion of Poland, having interest in Spiš and Orava. Those two regions (alongside with Cieszyn Silesia) were divided and disputed between Poland and Czechoslovakia since 1918, until the Poles fully annexed them following the Munich agreement. After the September Campaign, Slovakia reclaimed control of those territories.
Slovakia declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941 and signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941. Slovak troops fought on Germany's Eastern Front, with Slovakia furnishing Germany with two divisions totalling 20,000 men. 
During the war, approximately 70,000 Slovak Jews were sent to concentration camps to perish in the Holocaust. In September 1942, a Slovak-German treaty was signed detailing the conditions for the deportation of Slovak Jews.
Slovakia was spared German military occupation until the Slovak National Uprising, which began on August 29, 1944, and was almost immediately crushed by the Waffen SS and Slovak troops loyal to Josef Tiso, dictator of Slovakia.
Post World War II.
Following World War II, Slovak Socialist Republic became a communist state with the Czech Socialist Republic as Czechoslovakia. This continued until a peaceful dissolution in 1993 into the Slovak Republic and Czech Republic.
Relations during this period were primarily between the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Czechoslovakia under the Warsaw Pact.
Post 1992.
Following the creation of democratic Slovakia and German reunification, both countries traded under a free market economy.
In March 2001, a German court rejected compensation complaints from Slovakia's surviving Jews from the Holocaust. Claims were rejected again in 2002. In 2003, Slovak Jews made a collective claim of 77 million euros to Germany. The 2003 lawsuit filed against Germany by the Central Union of Jewish Religious Communities in the Slovak Republic (UZZNO) was made to reclaim compensation for monies paid by the wartime Slovak government to Germany to cover the cost of Germany's deportation of 57,000 members of the country's Jewish population.
State visits.
The following state visits have occurred in recent times:
German Federal President Horst Köhler visited Slovakia on 2 November 2005. German Chancellor Angela Merkel paid her first official visit to the Slovak Republic on 11 May 2006.
President Ivan Gašparovič visited Germany in July 2006. In the same month, the new Slovak Foreign Minister Kubiš paid his first official visit to Berlin. Prime Minister Robert Fico visited Germany in April 2007.
Economic relations.
Germany is Slovakia's largest trading partner.
In 2003, Germany was the biggest investor in Slovakia, with its volume of direct investment at about 1.94 billion euro as of March 31, 2003. At the time, Germany made 26.4% of all foreign direct investments in Slovakia.
This trend has continued in 2009, around 400 German firms are active in Slovakia investing 2.5 billion euro, making Germany is the biggest investor in Slovakia.
Car manufacturing.
In 1991, Volkswagen AG opened a factory in Bratislava. Revenue from the plant in 2003 was 4.5 billion euro. By 2006, the company had invested 1.3 billion EUR in its operations and employed 9,000 staff at the time.
In April 2009, Volkswagen AG announced plans to build a new compact family vehicle in Slovakia. The company will invest about 308 million euros. VW currently builds its Touareg, Škoda Octavia as well as its Audi Q7 in Bratislava and employs about 7,800 people in the nation, which has emerged a major hub in the global car industry. Porsche also builds its Cayenne model in Bratislava.
Cooperation.
In 1997, the two countries signed a military cooperation agreement.
In 2003, an e-government partnership was developed between the countries with the assistance of Siemens and Microsoft.
Key bilateral agreements include those on social insurance (instrument of ratification signed on 17 October 2003) and on road transport (signed on 14 June 2002).

Czech Republic–Slovakia relations

Czech-Slovak relations are foreign relations between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
History.
Before 1918, both countries were part of Austria–Hungary, and between 1918 and December 31, 1992, both countries were part of Czechoslovakia. 
Both countries established diplomatic relations on January 1, 1993. The Czech Republic has an embassy in Bratislava and a consulate general in Košice. Slovakia has an embassy in Prague and a consulate general in Brno. These international relations are usually referred to or described as "very good", "cordial", and "above standard" in the media. When a Czech or Slovak president is inaugurated, very often his first international visit is to the former part of the common country. The same custom applies to newly elected prime ministers of Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Both countries are full members of NATO and of the European Union. Both countries share 197 km of common borders. There are around 200,000 people of Slovak descent living in the Czech Republic and around 46,000 people of Czech descent living in Slovakia. Gustáv Slamečka, a Slovak citizen, was a Minister of Transportation of The Czech Republic from 2009 to 2010 and in his office he used exclusively Slovak language.

Hungary–Slovakia relations

Hungary–Slovakia relations are the foreign relations between Hungary and the Slovak Republic, two neighboring countries in Central Europe. There are two major periods of official relations between Slovakia and Hungary in the contemporary history. First period included relations between the Kingdom of Hungary and the first Slovak Republic in 1939-1945. The second period has started in 1993, when the countries again established diplomatic relations, the year when Slovakia became independent of Czechoslovakia. Hungary has an embassy in Bratislava, and Slovakia has an embassy in Budapest and a general consulate in Békéscsaba.
After the first break-up of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Hungary was the first state, which officially recognized the independent Slovakia. Subsequently, Hungary and Slovakia established embassies in Bratislava and Budapest and kept diplomatic relations during the World War Two. Despite a formal alliance inside the Berlin pact (1940) and a common war against the Anti-Hitler coalition, Slovak-Hungarian political relations maintained on the brink of war due to the frontier dispute and the oppression of Slovak minority in Hungary and Hungarian minority in Slovakia. The restoration of Czechoslovakia and the liquidation of the independent Slovakia in 1945 led to the end of the first period of Hungary-Slovakia's relations.
Nowadays, both countries are full members of NATO and of the European Union. They share of common borders. There are approximately 520,000 persons of Hungarian descent living in Slovakia (about 9.7% of its population) and around 39,266 persons of Slovak descent living in Hungary (about 0.38% of its population). There have been frequent minor diplomatic conflicts between the two countries.
History.
Slavs arrived to the Western Carpathians in the 6th century. In the early 9th century most of the Western Carpathians belonged to Great Moravia. By 896, Hungarian Tribes established Hungary with the entire Carpathian Mountain range as its borders and included the Pannonian Basin, including the western portions of Great Moravia.
The Czech National Revival in the neighboring Austrian lands significantly affected Slovak national sentiment, and use of the Slovak language which was being encroached upon by nationally sanctioned dominance of Hungarian. Following World War I, areas designated by the Allied states (predominantly France, in defiance of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points) which called for plebiscites, Northern Hungary was ceded to the newly established Czechoslovakia, according to the Treaty of Trianon (1920). The arrangement left a sizable Hungarian population residing on the territory of Slovakia and a much smaller Slovak minority in Hungary. The Hungarian Soviet Republic subsequently attempted to retake Hungarian portions of Czechoslovakia, but was defeated by a Czechoslovak-Romanian coalition.
Hungarians in Czechoslovakia in 1920-1938.
Immediately after its foundation, strong anti-Hungarian sentiment manifested in Czechoslovakia. The Elisabeth Science University was disbanded, and many historical monuments representing the Austro-Hungarian Empire destroyed.
Hungarians (and other minorities, e.g., Germans and Rusyns) were thus not present in the constituent assembly and had no influence on the new Czechoslovak constitution. It nevertheless, on paper at least, guaranteed minority rights and the use of minority languages in educational system and local representation. In practice, however, this egalitarianism was never realized as thousands of Hungarians and Germans were forced off their lands, imprisoned, or their property confiscated 
Due to gerrymandering the Hungarians had a diminished level of representation in the National Assembly and their influence on the politics of Czechoslovakia remained limited. The same factors also limited the Slovak intelligentsia's political power.
Slovak-Hungarian inter-state relations during the WWII (1939–1945).
During the World War II era, Hungary regained Hungarian-populated areas of Slovakia under the First Vienna Award of 1938. These territories were returned to Czechoslovakia when Hungary was defeated at the conclusion of World War II Treaty of Paris (with the exception of Carpathian Ruthenia which was annexed to the Soviet Union).
On March 14, 1939, Slovakia declared independence and Hungary was the first country to recognize its de-facto and de-jure. At the same time, Budapest, relying on the postulate of the actual breakup of Czechoslovakia, started the occupation of Carpathian Ruthenia, which also declared its independence. Following this military action, pointing to the controversial nature of the Slovak-Carpathian border, Hungarian troops began to engage in Eastern Slovakia. The “small war” on March 23-April 4, 1939 between Slovakia and Hungary tensed the atmosphere between Budapest and Bratislava. As a result of the conflict, the Tiso’s government agreed to cede to Hungary about 1000 km ² in the Eastern Slovakia.
Slovakia started to seek protection from the Hungarian revisionism in Germany, which promised the patronage of its sovereignty and territorial integrity by signing the Berlin treaty on March 23, 1939. Moreover, Bratislava cherished plans to change the 1938 borders and hoped for return of 3600 km ² areas (including Kosice) with a population of 350 thousand people (between them – around 200 000 Slovaks and 100 000 Magyars ).
In September 1939, Slovakia participated in the German offensive against Poland and was benefited by the reattachment of territories transferred to Poland in 1938. Otherwise, Budapest showed sympathy with Warsaw and refused the passage of Slovak troops to Poland by Hungarian railroads. Also, 100 000 Polish refugees found haven in Hungary. Many of them were settled in the ex-Southern Slovakia, probably, in order to reinforce Hungarian order in the frontier regions with Slovakia.
Also, in the first two years the Second World War, Slovakia and Hungary tried to improve their relations with the USSR and to use the Soviet-German conflictive rapprochement (in 1939-1941) in their revisionist interests. While Slovaks hoped to cooperate with the Kremlin on the basis of the Soviet claims to Subcarpathian Ruthenia, Hungarians scheduled parallel action with the Soviet Red Army against Romania for the return of Transylvania to Hungary and Bessarabia for the Soviet Union. On the other side, Moscow hesitated to choose between the rapprochement with Slovakia (and Romania) or Hungary until the summer of 1940. Afterwards, when pro-Russian Slovak leader Ferdinand Durcansky was removed from the post of the head of the Slovak MFA in Jun 1940, the Soviets tried to play the “Hungarian card” and supported the Budapest claims against Bucharest on Transylvania in August 1940. Thus, Hungary was able to motivate Germany to make pressure on Romania to cede the Northern Transylvania to Hungary. Following months, Moscow showed other Hungarophile signs: signed a trade treaty with Hungary on 3 September 1940; did not protested against Hungary’s accession to the Berlin pact on November 1940; on autumn 1941 solemnly send back to Budapest Hungarian flags, which were took as haul during the oppression of the Hungarian revolution of 1848 by Russian army. Nevertheless, the Kremlin was unable to overcome the Berlin influence in Hungary, which played the role of protector against Slovak revisionism and promised new territorial concessions in Yugoslavia in autumn 1941.
So, in 1941, Berlin gradually achieved the reduction of the Soviet sympathies of both Danubian states. The Slovak and Hungarian declaration of war on the Soviet Union in June, and the UK and the US in December 1941 finally cemented the two States under the influence of the Axis Berlin-Rome. This dependence iced the revisionist hopes in Bratislava and Budapest as Berlin refused to raise the issue of border changes until the end of the war. In autumn 1941 the Slovak-Hungarian relations sharpened twice, however, they were normalized under German pressure. During the Berlin meeting of Slovak and Hungarian prime-ministers Votech Tuka and Laszlo Bardossy on 25-26 November 1941, two leaders agreed to improve State’s bilateral relations and to register the previously banned political and cultural organization of the Slovak and Hungarian minorities.
During 1942, the Slovak-Hungarian continued to improve. Protracted war, accompanied by military defeats of the Axis, made adjustments to the diplomacy of the Danubian states. In March 1942, after the request of the Hungarian regent Miklos Horthy, Miklos Kallay formed a government and began secret negotiations with the British and Americans in order to withdraw Hungary from the war. In the spring of 1943 Kallay initiated the start of negotiations with Slovakia, where the central issue was the "anti-German U-turn" and the rapprochement between the two countries. However, Bratislava was primarily interested in the return of Kosice, that was inacceptable for Budapest. Meanwhile, Hungarians unofficially hinted to Slovaks that the frontiers of 1938 could be revoked if Slovakia would be merged with Hungary in a confederation.
Budapest continued to seek a rapprochement with Bratislava and in early 1944 contacted Slovak military. However, the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944 did not allow occur a clear agreement between Budapest and Bratislava. Moreover, an attempt to seize power by the Slovak military and to move Slovakia to the side of the anti-Hitler coalition in September-October 1944 ended in failure. During this uprising, the Slovaks established a link with the Hungarian government of Geza Lakatos and helped him to send a Hungarian peace delegation to Moscow. Finally, the defeat of the Slovak national uprising led to the complete occupation of Slovakia by German troops. At the same time, Berlin insisted on the transfer of power in Hungary to a loyal nationalist government of Ferenc Szalasi. Thus, the relationship between Slovakia and Hungary in late 1944 came under the full control of Germany. On the other hand, the anti-Hitler coalition, determined to recover Czechoslovakia and eliminate Slovakia, removed from the daily agenda the interstate Slovak -Hungarian relations until 1993.
Gabčíkovo – Nagymaros Dams.
The "Budapest Treaty" of 1977, between Hungary and Czechoslovakia, was a plan to tame the Danube and increase its navigability with levees, dams, locks, overflow channels, and designated flood plains, and to generate hydroelectricity. The joint project was intended to cover the entire 150 km stretch of the Danube as it forms the border between Slovakia and Hungary, from the upstream, western, end at Čunovo, Slovakia, to Nagymaros, Hungary, in the east. Construction started when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, but only on the Slovak side. In 1989, Hungary had suspended its participation and in 1992 backed out of the treaty altogether citing environmental concerns. This caused a still unresolved international dispute between Slovakia and Hungary. Both parties turned to the International Court at The Hague for a ruling.
1993 - 1998.
The relations were strained from the very beginning of Slovakia's existence as an independent state in 1993 due to Hungary's refusal to sign the treaty declaring inviolability of the mutual boundaries and also because Hungary declared its intent to interfere into Slovak internal affairs with the objective of Hungarian minority protection, which was perceived as unacceptable in Slovakia.
In 1995 the Slovak language law came into force, which demanded that civil servants speak it and imposed fines on the use of foreign languages on public documents or in broadcasting without a translation into the state language. National minorities were exempt from several of its provisions. The sections about the fines were later deemed unconstitutional by the Slovak constitutional court and henceforth abolished in 1999. In 2009, the Slovak Language Law made the use of the minority language in official communication punishable in towns and villages where the ethnic community now made up less than 20 percent of the total population. All documentation of minority schools should be duplicated in the state language. The law stipulates that the names of streets and buildings anywhere in Slovakia must be stated in the Slovak language 1100-year-old tradition and it also introduces sanctions of up to €5,000 ($7,000) on those who break rules promoting the use of Slovak in public and for municipalities and public offices for not using the Slovak language "properly."
Since both Slovakia and Hungary were aspiring for EU membership at the time, in 1995 Hungarian prime minister Gyula Horn along with his Slovak counterpart Vladimír Mečiar were pressured into signing a bilateral treaty. This treaty included measures for guaranteeing the minority rights for both countries and also a pledge not to consider the treatment of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia as an internal affair and vice versa. This last provision has been subsequently ignored by Vladimír Mečiar's and Robert Fico's administration as well. Mečiar even suggested a complete population exchange at a bilateral negotiation with Horn in 1997.
The Malina controversy.
Hedvig Malina, a Hungarian student from Horné Mýto, Slovakia, made claims of being physically assaulted in a hate crime incident. Malina claims she was severely beaten and robbed on 25 August 2006 in Nitra after speaking Hungarian in public. She claims her attackers wrote "SK for Slovakia without parasites" (), and "Hungarians to the other side of the Danube" () on her clothes. Upon investigation of the incident by Slovak Police, Malina was accused of making misleading statements to the police and has been charged with perjury. In December 2007, Slovak police released a video tape of the initial hearing to Malina's lawyers, who are now claiming irregularities in the way the interview had been conducted. Malina has taken her case to the European Court of Human Rights, challenging what she terms the "inhumane and humiliating" conduct of Slovak officials.
Confirmation of the Beneš decrees.
In the summer of 2007, Party of the Hungarian Coalition has proposed a law that would grant compensation by "moral and financial means" for Hungarians harmed by the Beneš decrees of former Czechoslovakia. This compensation was to consist of a fund that would be available to the Hungarian community is Slovakia by various means. A similar fund exists to compensate the Germans and the Jews for the wrongdoings of 1939-47. Despite the historic record, Slovaks argue Hungarians were never expelled (as were the Germans), nor exterminated in death camps (as were the Jews). All ethnically Slovak members voted to confirm the decrees; Hungarian leaders voted against them. The then Hungarian President László Sólyom said the decision was unacceptable and that it would put a strain on Hungarian-Slovak relations.
Slovak riot police beating of Hungarian football fans.
A November 1, 2008 soccer match between FC Dunajska Streda and Slovan Bratislava was disrupted by Slovak riot police after only 15 minutes injuring more than 60 people, many of whom lost consciousness or suffered injuries including concussion and broken jaws. Local policemen stormed Hungarian nationals, who were at the game to support the home team and to protest the burning of a Hungarian flag at an earlier game. flags with Árpád stripes, favoured by the extreme right in Hungary, were being waved and the home crowd sang the Hungarian national anthem before kickoff.
Press reports from the scene said that the police failed to act against Bratislava supporters who were throwing smoke bombs, noise grenades and other missiles on the pitch. Based on videos posted on the internet showing the incident from various angles the supporters were not doing anything that would warrant such an intervention by police. Five days after the game the Slovak police presented a photo as evidence, showing one of the supporters raising his fist to throw a punch, but police officers can not be seen on the image. Spontaneous demonstrations were held in Budapest at the embassy and the consulate of Slovakia on the night of the incident. Protesters lit candles to honor the victims and burned a Slovak flag.
Claims of Hungarian irredentism in Viktor Orbán speech.
Hungarian opposition leader, chairman of Fidesz, Viktor Orbán delivered a campaign speech in Esztergom, Hungary on May 23, 2009, two weeks before the 2009 European elections, in which he wondered how many MEPs will represent the Hungarians from the Carpathian Basin. (This geographical region, the traditional area of the Kingdom of Hungary, includes areas of Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, Ukraine, Croatia and Austria.) The governing coalition of Slovakia condemned the move.
Language laws.
Slovak language law.
In 2009 the Slovak parliament passed a language law, mandating preferential use of the state language – Slovak. Use of a non-state language in state institutions (local government, hospital, police) by citizens interacting with it could carry a financial penalty. The law does not interfere with private use of minority languages.
Reaction of Hungary.
Gordon Bajnai, the Hungarian Prime Minister, has charged Slovakia of scapegoating Hungarian speakers.
According to the Hungarian standpoint, depriving a local government from its right to ensure making any minority language use at windows possible if ratio of that minority on the settlement was under 10% was unacceptable, only relieving them from an obligation to ensure that would be acceptable by European standards under any percentage. Prohibiting to use it in hospitals, or making it illegal for a postman to hand over a monthly pension if the pensioner can only acknowledge in Hungarian that she is currently receiving her monthly pension was considered endangering basic human rights.The Government of Hungary turned to the EU institutions to request the law from Slovakia in, analyze it according to the requirements of EU treaties and conventions and nullify any points they find contradicting them.
The leaders of EU stated that national legislation is under the authority of member nation states, and while EU was founded in order to avert conflicts and solve it in it, bilateral relations doesn't have to take place in the European Parliament. Yet according to request the procedure of checking the conformity of the law the EU institutions naturally start.
Some members of the Government of Hungary during interviews expressed their expectation from older members states to make their presence felt not only when their economic expansion can be achieved, but when there are problems, and try to investigate problems and get informed about marginally known territory when that is necessary.
After the EU handed over the list it found in breach with regulation accepted by Slovakia by being a member the Government told the press it will keep its attention on the process of the modifications and will report again if the result after deadline it considers unsatisfactory.
Press and international reaction.
Hungarian foreign minister Péter Balázs compared the creation of the language law to the politics of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime on the use of language. The dual standards for Czech language usage in Slovakia has been questioned with Slovak authorities even considering a ban, however this charge ignores the mutual intelligibility between Czech and Slovak, which render them compatible in business and law.
Opponents have described the law as one that "criminalises the use of Hungarian", According to Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe High Commissioner on National Minorities Knut Vollebæk the language law complies with international law and Slovakia's international obligations. The Party of the Hungarian Coalition (MKP) asked the Slovak Government to release communication exchanged between them and Vollebæk so that the opinion of Vollebæk regarding the law could not be misrepresented or distorted. According to the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs the report was released unchanged and in full. Spokesman Peter Stano stated: "It is obvious that the Party of the Hungarian Coalition was unable to question the reliability of Vollebæk report, that law is following the legitimate goal and it's in accordance with all international norms." Vollebaek will monitor the situation until the law on minority language use will reach the level of the state language law.
The American Hungarian Federation (AHF), the largest Hungarian-American umbrella organization in the United States, has repeatedly called attention to what it calls an "unacceptable" law that is "inconsistent with Slovakia’s freely assumed obligations, Western values, democratic principles and the international norms to which Slovakia as a member of the OSCE has committed itself." AHF sees a discriminatory and ill-advised language law as the latest manifestation of the intolerance toward the Hungarian minority by certain segments of Slovakia’s political elite now in office. It notes additional human and minority rights issues such as the gerrymandering of the administrative division of Slovakia so that Hungarians are in the minority in the administrative regions; adopting a resolution proposed by extremist Jan Slota ratifying and confirming the Benes decrees (which imposed collective guilt on Hungarians and continue to adversely affect them); and refusing to rehabilitate Janos Esterhazy, who as leader of the Hungarian Party in Tiso’s Fascist Slovakia was the only Member of Parliament to vote against the deportation of Jews in 1942, yet who died in a Czechoslovak prison after the war.
Minorities in Hungary.
Hungary states any national-cultural identification that is compatible with western human right values is equal and as long as they are not in breach with them allows free cultural activity. At the request of minorities names of settlements can be written at their border in their language also, this has been done to many settlements. In practice this means German and Slavic names. Minority local governments operate. Because of the general homogenous state of the country and because of the economic limits of building greater networks in a country with such size presence of minorities can only be found if searched for. Employees speaking foreign languages may find it necessary to go to offices specialized for them. English and German forms of documents are mostly available.
Minorities lacked national treatment during the communist times. Marxism defined nationalism, mythic symbology, irrational allocation of resources for artistic reasons and language as enemies of the masses. Mythic, middle-ages symbology and labour-allocation for details on swords etc. was described as producing opium, sold by the feudal lords. Different languages constituted barriers among people and nationalism was used to make people think the feudal lords were defending them from conquest and national assimilation, a death in spirit. According to Marx in reality they defended the form of exploitation, 'nation', by presenting exploiters as defenders. Territorial changes were just replacing exploiter feudal lords. The savior-picture of nobles defending peasants from armies of enemy nobles and the language barriers prevented people from recognizing and uniting against their common oppressor. Russian language and Soviet culture was promoted, even from Hungarian history only peasant-rebels, folk-poets and Republican revolutionaries were promoted. No national cultural life was supported. This resulted in remaining Slovaks feeling themselves deprived from their national identity.
According to Slovak historian Ladislav Deák, during communist rule in Hungary, most of the Slovak minority who did not emigrate were stripped of their Slovak identity. Jenő Kaltenbach, Hungarian ex-ombudsman for national minorities and president of the German Minority Self-Government in Hungary, said that "minorities in Hungary, without exception, are on edge of abyss of their identity", "the national minorities were practically assimilated and action programs for them are just an illusion". He also said that the Hungarian minority language law is "nice to hear, but full of unrealised law norms".
Komárno incident.
In August 2009 the Hungarian president, László Sólyom, planned a visit to the Slovak city of Révkomárom/Komárno to unveil a statue commemorating Saint Stephen of Hungary. The day of the visit, August 21 coincided with the date of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, of which Hungary was a participant, and it is one day after the national celebration of the foundation of the Hungarian state (August 20). The Slovak government labelled the timing deliberate provocation, and questioned the president's refusal to meet with Slovak delegates. The Slovak government issued a one-day travel ban in response, and manned the bridge with policemen to prevent rioting. Sólyom did not enter Slovakia. The government of Hungary called the ban "unfounded" and "unacceptable". Hungary plans to lodge a complaint with the EU, however, according to der Standard, the European Commission does not want to concern itself with the case. The Advocate-General in charge of the case at the Court of Justice of the EU supported the legality of the ban.
Attack on the Slovak Embassy.
Attack on the embassy itself.
On August 26, 2009, a few days after the Komárno incident, two Molotov cocktails were thrown at the Slovak embassy in Budapest, causing no casualties as the flammable fluids did not ignite or detonate. Authorities condemned the attack. The foreign ministry of Slovakia stated they view the incident with great concern, but at the same time "it is seen as an isolated criminal offence".
Attack on the Slovak ambassador.
On August 27, 2009, one day following the armed attack on the embassy, a Hungarian driver attempted to run the diplomatic car of Peter Weiss off the road while driving in the Budapest traffic. Though the diplomatic vehicle remained on the road, the driver begun to verbally assault its occupants. The driver and his accomplices were stopped and it is now being investigated whether the outburst was connected to the Embassy attack. The Slovak government did not condemn the attack as a good-will gesture towards Hungary.
Political statements by a leading member of the Slovak governing coalition.
Following the Slovak parliamentary elections of 2006 the far-right Slovak National Party (SNS) became a small part of the governing coalition. Ján Slota, chairman of SNS is known for anti-Hungarian sentiment. "Der Spiegel" and various international media outlets have reported Slota as saying “The Hungarians are a tumor in the body of the Slovak nation.” He also threatened to send tanks to "flatten Budapest" should Slovakia's Hungarian minority, once the ruling class and still about 10 percent of the country's population today, attempt to teach the Slovaks "the Lord's Prayer in Hungarian" once again. Slota also called Hungarians the descendants of "ugly, bow-legged, Mongoloid characters on disgusting horses".
Historical revisionism.
It has been alleged that Deputy PM Robert Fico has been engaging in historical revisionism in the government's update of the national curriculum. Slovak political scientist Miroslav Kusý claims that by adopting such scientifically questionable rhetoric Fico aims to "strengthen national consciousness by the falsification of history". It is not known whether this issue has affected relations between the states.
The Slovak National Party has sidelined a long-planned joint textbook with Hungary and is promoting instead a Slovak-centred view of the country’s patchwork past.
Hungarian nationality law reform and bill of the day of national unity.
On May 26, 2010, the Fidesz-dominated newly elected Hungarian Parliament
voted to give the ethnic Hungarians living in other countries the right to claim Hungarian citizenship without requiring them to live in Hungary. The only requirements are a Hungarian ancestry and a command of Hungarian.
The purpose of the government MEPs was reunification of the nation according to their own evaluation of who is in need of being granted simplified process of citizenship. The requirements were eased as address in Hungary was not required anymore.
Slovak political force condemned the move and initiated a law that makes a person lose their Slovak citizenship if they take up another in order to discourage them from doing that. The Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico called the proposed reforms a threat to national security. In response to the passage of the Hungarian nationality law reform Slovakia altered its own citizenship law, stripping Slovak citizenship from any Slovak citizen who applies for another citizenship (not applicable if naturalisation procedure is initiated by another states' authorities); in effect highly restricting its recognition of dual citizenship.
Radical Slovak politician Jan Slota stated that as many Hungarians live on both side of the Danube, the next step by them after getting their citizenship can be the demand of being annexed back to Hungary. For this reason he considered his and others' fears justified, and told the press he obviously doesn't accuse Slovaks living in Australia to have the intention of annexing it to Australia, but with Hungary they believe their fear has rational bases.
On 31 May 2010 the Hungarian Parliament declared June 4, the day on which Hungary signed the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, the day of national unity. The bill was criticized by opposition members, former Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány wrote in his blog 'The law wants to heal the injuries of Trianon but only makes new ones.' The bill was voted by 302 representatives (55 rejected, 12 abstained) and it states that: "Every member and community of the Hungarians,who are forced to live under several foreign authorities, is a part of the unified Hungarian nation, whom unity above all state borders is a reality, moreover it is an important element of the individual and universal self-identity of every Hungarian."
'For Slovakia the Treaty of Trianon bears a historical importance', Slovak President Ivan Gasparovic reacted on the new bill. 'It is a valid document, which was accepted by every signatory's own will. It must be obeyed, its purposes and consequences must not be questioned!' Gasparovic expressed fears that the new Hungarian government and Parliament wants to make a change in foreign policy and wants a revision of the treaty.
The second Orbán administration didn't announce such change which would have been a deviation of the long-term political strategy accepted in the early 1990s, which was the former Orbán administration's strategy also. Hungary has also expressed several times - and suggested it in this very bill – that it does not seek any territorial revision. Seeking it would endanger peace and would most probably end its membership in EU and NATO.
According to an opinion piece by Slovak journalist Martin M. Šimečka the law resembles the Russian policy of granting citizenship to the inhabitants of the Georgian region of South Ossetia prior to the war of 2008, in which the Russian forces claimed to be protecting new Russian citizens on the Georgian territory. (Note: both Hungary and Slovakia are European Union and NATO members.)
The Hungarian step triggered tensions between the two countries, and sparked an angry response from Slovakia. Slovakia strongly opposes the plan. Slovakia itself allowed dual citizenship at the time, and allowed a limited right of return for ethnic Slovaks (see Slovak nationality law).
Of Hungary's neighbours, only Slovakia has objected to the move. As of December 2011, there are at least four ethnic Hungarians who were stripped of their Slovak citizenship after gaining Hungarian citizenship, and were ordered to hand in their Slovak identity documents at a police station.
János Esterházy controversy.
In an August 23, 2011 statement President of Slovakia Ivan Gašparovič opposed erecting a sculpture in János Esterházy’s memory in Kosice, saying that the one-time deputy had been a follower of Adolf Hitler and fascism. He also opposed Ferdinand Ďurčanský's sculpture in that case. The president said the Hungarian ethnic politician and martyr was a supporter of Nazism. In fact Esterházy had been the only member of the Slovak parliament to vote against anti-Jewish laws in 1942. The one-time deputy had always rejected both fascism and communism, suffered in the Gulag and died in a Moravian prison in 1957.
Hungary’s Foreign Ministry the next day rejected Slovak President Ivan Gasparovic’s statement and said that the ideology reflected in the statement did not contribute to the development of bilateral relations. The ministry “notes with regret and incomprehension” that issues surrounding the martyred count are in the focus of daily Slovak politics, the ministry said. The achievements of Esterházy are recognised in many countries including Israel, the statement noted. Marek Trubac, the Slovak president’s spokesman, told MTI that Esterházy is considered a war criminal in Slovakia, “for supporting fascist ideology”. Though Esterházy did vote against the anti-Jewish bills, he also welcomed (former Hungarian regent) Miklós Horthy’s “fascist troops” that occupied Kosice, the spokesman added.
Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjén said he was appalled by Gasparovic’s statement. He said that Esterházy “heroically exercised the virtues” and was all along committed to the teachings of the Catholic Church, so it is not by chance that his beatification is under way. Semjén called the attack on Esterházy’s memory an insult to the Hungarian nation and the Catholic Church and a violation of universal human rights.
Hungarian President Pál Schmitt said "it is unacceptable that János Esterházy, this true democrat and humanist, still qualifies as a war criminal in Slovakia". The president noted that the Hungarian government and his predecessors had repeatedly initiated Esterházy’s rehabilitation. Schmitt closed the letter with the hope that his forthcoming meeting with Gašparovič in Budapest would focus on the two countries’ common values.

Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering

Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 41 S. Ct. 172 (1921) is a United States Supreme Court case which examined the labor provisions of the Clayton Antitrust Act and reaffirmed the prior ruling in "Loewe v. Lawlor" that a secondary boycott was an illegal restraint on trade. The decision authorized courts to issue injunctions to block this practice, and any other tactics used by labor unions that were deemed unlawful restraints on trade.
Background.
In response to growing public pressure to control the unprecedented concentrations of economic power that developed after the American Civil War, Congress enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890). It proscribed “unlawful restraints and monopolies” in interstate commerce as well as conspiracies to erect them. Soon thereafter federal judges began to employ the measure to combat efforts to unionize workers and to deny labor its traditional self‐help weapons. To counteract this “government by injunction,” the United States Congress included in the Clayton Act (1914) provisions that sought to preclude application of antitrust legislation against organized labor.
Opinion of the Court.
The Supreme Court reached the issue in Deering, a six‐judge majority holding that the Clayton Act did not insulate labor unions engaged in illegal activities, such as the conduct of a secondary boycott. Justice Mahlon Pitney asserted that the machinist union's coercive action constituted an unlawful conspiracy to “obstruct and destroy” (p. 460) the interstate trade of complainant, a company with which they were not “proximately or substantially concerned” (p. 472).
Dissent.
Writing for the three dissenters, Justice Louis D. Brandeis charged the majority with ignoring law and reality: the injunction imposed by the Court deprived labor of forms of a collective action Congress had tried “expressly” to legalize (p. 486).
Subsequent history.
For more than a decade, the majority's narrow interpretation of the nation's antitrust legislation sanctioned judicial application of injunctions against workers seeking to organize to advance their interests. With the dramatic transformation of opinion brought about by the Great Depression, Congress included in the Norris‐LaGuardia Act (1932) provisions to exempt organized labor from antitrust injunctions, and the Supreme Court legitimated this fundamental New Deal legislation.

Lit de Justice

Lit de Justice (foaled January 12, 1990, in Kentucky) is an American Champion Thoroughbred racehorse. He was bred by Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud and purchased by the French racing operation Mise de Moratalla, who named him for a famous Parlement of Paris known as the "Lit de justice". The colt was sired by El Gran Senor, who was an outstanding son of Northern Dancer and earned Irish and English Champion honours at age two in 1983 and at three in 1984. He was out of the mare Kanmary, whose sire Kenmare was a French Group One winner and the Leading sire in France in 1988 and 1989.
Trained by Alain de Royer-Dupre to run on European turf courses, Lit de Justice began racing at age two. On August 1, 1992, he finished fourth in his debut at Deauville-La Touques Racecourse. Winless at ages two and three, Lit de Justice got his first victory in his thirteenth start on June 4, 1994, in the Prix Durbar at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse. He made one more winless start in France before being sold on July 17, 1994, to Carol and Cornelius Ray's Evergreen Farm located near Paris, Kentucky. The Rays turned Lit de Justice over to California trainer Jenine Sahadi, who conditioned the horse for racing on dirt at Del Mar Racetrack. 
After a second-place finish in his American debut in a minor race on July 30, 1994, at Del Mar Racetrack, on August 27, Lit de Justice got his first American win. As a five-year-old, he won the Potrero Grande Handicap and then set a new Del Mar track record for seven furlongs in winning the Pat O'Brien Breeders' Cup Handicap before finishing third in the Breeders' Cup Sprint behind winner Desert Stormer.
At age six, Lit de Justice won four of his seven starts to go with two third-place finishes. Among his wins, he set a new Santa Anita Park track record for five and a half furlongs in the El Conejo Handicap. His fourth win of 1996, and most important of his career, came in the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Canada. Sent off as the betting favorite under regular jockey Corey Nakatani, Lit de Justice won by coming from last to first in the fourteen-horse-field, defeating top runners including Honour and Glory (3rd) and Langfuhr (8th). His winning time tied a Woodbine track record that had stood for twenty-three years. The win was the first in a Breeders' Cup race for jockey Nakatani. For trainer Sahadi, it was not just her first Breeders' Cup victory, but the first by a female trainer in Breeders' Cup history.
For his 1996 performances, Lit de Justice was voted the Eclipse Award for American Champion Sprint Horse.
As a sire.
Retired after his Breeders' Cup win, Lit de Justice stood at stud at the Kentucky division of Frank Stronach's Adena Springs. While none of his offspring have achieved Lit de Justice's success, he sired a number of very good runners and stakes race winners and is the damsire of 2008 Canadian Classic winner Harlem Rocker. In 2003, Lit de Justice was sold to Magali Farms near Santa Ynez, California. On July 20, 2012, he died from the infirmities of old age at 22.

On the Murder of Eratosthenes

On the Murder of Eratosthenes is a speech by Lysias, one of the "Canon of Ten" Attic orators. The speech, the first in the transmitted Lysianic corpus, is a defense written for Euphiletos who is charged with the death of Eratosthenes. The case is heard before the Delphinion, a court which hears proceedings for justifiable homicide
The case.
Euphiletos is accused of killing Eratosthenes, who was caught in the act of adultery with Euphiletos's wife. Euphiletos's defense is that his killing of Eratosthenes was an act of justifiable homicide and therefore not punishable.
The argument of the speech.
Lysias's approach in this defense speech is not to introduce any tangible evidence, but to rhetorically persuade the Delphinion of Euphiletos's innocence by creating a favorable portrayal of him while discrediting and attacking Eratosthenes's character and shedding light on his reputation as a notorious adulterer.
Lysias’ main framework in this speech was to portray two characters of the society that each individual in the Delphinion could understand and relate to. Lysias’s characterization of Euphiletos became the most important part in this speech, as he created him to be a trusting and naïve individual who seems incapable of the kind of deception alleged by his accusers. This allows Euphiletos to claim justification for his act, because he is not a heinous murderer, but instead a man that sought out legal justice against a seducing adulterer. In contrast, Lysias shows Eratosthenes to have the personality of an “arch-seducer, and a threat to society.” With this unfavorable portrayal of Eratosthenes's personal characteristics, Lysias hopes to prove to the Delphinion that he received the punishment suited for him. Lysias needed to make clear that Eratosthenes was not the type of individual that deserved to roam the streets of Athens and that the entire community would be a safer place now that he is dead. Moreover, not only was Euphiletos not guilty of murder, he was actually upholding the law by carrying out a justifiable homicide. Lysias concludes the speech by saying that if Euphiletos is punished for the murder of Eratosthenes then the court is basically protecting seducers and corrupting society.
The question of premeditation.
Because it was crucial that Lysias established that the murder of Eratosthenes was not premeditated, but a lawful act of justifiable homicide, Euphiletos states that when Eratosthenes entered the home, he left to gather witnesses that could provide testimony in the trial that would follow the murder. Lysias understood the importance of convincing the judging panel that Euphiletos did not plan to murder Eratosthenes so he incorporated the repetition of this point in varying places in the speech. In paragraph 23, Euphiletos says, “I caught some people at home. Some I found were abroad.” Later, in paragraph 43, Euphiletos adds more detail, he states, “I went to Harmodios’s house and to another person’s, and they were abroad - I didn’t know - others I did not find at home, but I took who I could and proceeded on my way.” These statements show that Euphiletos was responding, without premeditation, to the act of adultery being committed by his wife and Eratosthenes. He said that he went in search of witnesses and found that some people were home and others were not. Lysias is saying that if Euphiletos had planned to murder Eratosthenes and was just trying to make the murder appear to be justifiable, then he would have gone to the homes of people who he knew for certain were in town. Euphiletos recounts the same information regarding his spontaneous search in an attempt to leave a lasting impression on the court. These passages are consistent with Lysias’s portrayal of Euphiletos as a naive husband who, in being wronged, carried out a lawful act of murder.
Adultery and the role of women in Athenian society.
A central theme in the speech is the role that women play in Athenian society. The idea that a woman’s role in society should remain subservient is maintained throughout the defense. Women have their own quarters in the house where they would conduct their working duties. In Athenian society, the seclusion of a woman reflects highly upon the character of the man whom she is married to or lives with. If he was able to seclude her from society and other men, he was regarded as a decent man; however, failure to control women in this society is an ultimate disgrace. With this in mind, once Euphiletos caught his wife engaging in an affair with Eratosthenes, he sought out justice through death for the seducer that persuaded his wife into bed. Lysias describes Eratosthenes as being a corrupter of minds, as if Euphiletos's wife had no control over her own actions. In addition, Euphiletos learns of his wife's infidelity through a servant girl who works for him. The servant girl was in effect an accessory because she passed notes between Eratosthenes and Euphiletos's wife.
The role of witnesses.
Euphiletos produces many witnesses throughout his defense case, most of whom were his close friends. Witnesses were of monumental importance in the Athenian court system. Athenian court proceedings relied heavily upon word of mouth. This allowed for the testimonies of the witnesses in a case to hold a great amount of emphasis in these trials. Euphiletos uses this to his advantage, as many of his witnesses are those that he gathered on the night that he killed Eratosthenes. Witnesses in these cases were brought to offer their support for the speaker for whom they represented and to attest to what he was saying. The prosecution in this case were the kinsmen of the victim. They attempt to show that Euphiletos acted in a premeditated manner based on a previous quarrel between Euphiletos and Eratosthenes. They also make an effort to prove that the servant girl lured Eratosthenes to Euphiletos's house just so he could be murdered. 
It is also mentionable that Euphiletos had non-violent options on how to deal with Eratosthenes under Athenian law, such as the implementing of a fine.

Suction blister

Suction blistering is a technique used in dermatology to treat chronic wounds, such as non-healing leg ulcers. When a wound is not healing properly, an autologous skin graft is the best option, to prevent rejection of the tissue. Since autologous transplantation cannot always be performed, a substitute has to be used, such as cultured skin. However, this technique is costly and time consuming.
Method.
During suction blistering, the lamina lucida of the skin is cleaved from the underlying layers. This separates the epidermis from the dermis. With the use of small vacuum pumps, little fluid filled blisters are created, typically on the abdomen. Blisters are usually formed within 2 to 3 hours.
Subsequently, the donor-site is treated with antiseptic drugs and covered with bandages. The acceptor-site is treated with non-adherent bandages, to prevent the skin graft from sticking to the bandages.

<doc id="20516416" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20516416" title="Small Self Administered Scheme">
Small Self Administered Scheme

Small Self Administered Scheme (SSAS) is a type of UK Occupational Pension Scheme. 
Schemes are trust-based and established individually, usually by directors of limited companies for specified employees of the company. Since Pension Simplification (also known as A-Day), SSAS has been available for establishment by those who are not in a limited company (i.e. Partnerships and Families).
Tax relief.
SSAS registered with HMRC may enjoy tax-exempt status, all investments made will be free of Capital Gains Tax, and contributions to the SSAS will receive tax-relief (if contributions are made by a "Relevant UK Individual"). Basic rate tax relief can be claimed by the SSAS itself, and any higher rate tax would be claimed through the member's tax return. However, it should be noted that the vast majority of SSAS do not reclaim tax on members contributions as this would require the scheme Trustee / Administrator applying for Relief at Source via HMRC.
The sponsoring employer can also pay contributions to the scheme and may obtain tax relief on the contributions.
Tax relief on personal contributions is calculated at the person's marginal rate of income tax, and for company contributions it is calculated as the company's marginal rate of corporation tax. Third party contributions may be made in some circumstances.
Ownership.
Provided that the members of the SSAS pension scheme are also trustees, there is a lesser regulatory requirement than if all members were not trustees. This is because the members of the SSAS pension scheme are deemed to be investing the funds for themselves. 
The trustees can invest the funds as they consider appropriate to the needs of the SSAS pension scheme. For example, the trustees can invest the assets of the pension scheme in the company that sponsors the SSAS pension scheme – a process known as pension-led funding. This can take the form of loans to the employer and the purchase of shares in the sponsor, however, there are limits that apply. One must be very careful purchasing shares in the company through a SSAS, 'Taxable moveable property' laws can easily be breached. Guidance from the SSAS Practitioner or Administrator is required. 
SSAS are suited to groups of individuals who run a common businesses and wish to have complete control over the pension fund. The costs per member are usually lower than using individual SIPPs to pool funds to purchase commercial property. SIPPs do not have the facility to loan funds to associated or unassociated employers. There is no requirement for a professional to be appointed to the scheme, however, the rules are complex and may well prove difficult for individuals without experience running SSAS.
The Trustees may wish to appoint a professional company to assist with the management of the scheme. This company may operate as SSAS Practitioner or as the Scheme Administrator. They both carry out the tax returns and other such submissions to HMRC and the Regulator. If the scheme returns are not correctly undertaken a penalty can be assessed against the trustees of the pension scheme
If a scheme Administrator is appointed to run the scheme, they are usually co-signatory on the scheme's investments. A SSAS Practitioner will not be co-signatory, this leads to Trustees and beneficiaries of the scheme having far greater control over their pension assets and enables the scheme to run more efficiently.
Investment choice.
The investments allowable for a SSAS are very similar to a SIPP. The Trustees of the SSAS may make choices about what assets are bought, leased or sold, and decide when those assets are acquired or disposed of, subject to the unanimous agreement of all trustees.
The range of assets permitted by HMRC includes : 
Investments currently permitted by primary legislation but subsequently made subject to heavy tax penalties include :
Benefit rules.
The pension benefits payable include a tax free cash sum from age 50/55; plus a pension income paid from the pension scheme. On death the benefits may be paid out to beneficiaries, special rules apply on death after age 75. There is no requirement to purchase an annuity. http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/rpsmmanual/rpsm09100300.htm

New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit

The New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit is the Emergency Service Unit (ESU) for the New York City Police Department. A component of the Special Operations Division of the Patrol Services Bureau, the unit provides specialized support and advanced equipment to other NYPD units. For example, its Canine Unit helps with searches for perpetrators and missing persons. The Emergency Service Unit also functions as a Special Weapons and Tactics Unit (SWAT) and NYPD hostage negotiators assist and secure the safety of hostages. Members of "ESU" are cross trained in multiple disciplines for police and rescue work. They are always on patrol (all three tours, 365 days a year) with 10 Heavy Rescue trucks, each manned by a police officer and a sergeant, and often more than twice as many smaller Radio Emergency Patrol vehicles containing two ESU police officers. There are also two or more patrol Sergeants or Lieutenants in unmarked vehicles on duty at all times to supervise ESU operations where needed. These are called "U-Cars" on the NYPD radio, for example, "U-5".
Field organizations.
The ten Emergency Service Squads (ESS) are divided geographically as:
Emergency Service Squads (or Trucks):
ESS-11 is not a patrol squad but a vehicle manned by trainers and support staff assigned to ESU headquarters at Floyd Bennett Field and can respond to nearby incidents or as back-up to other Emergency Service Squads when required.
Lieutenants are city wide patrol supervisors who are assigned to patrol multiple "trucks". They patrol as either U-5 (Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island), or U-4, (Manhattan and the Bronx) and respond to major incidents within their assigned boroughs for the shift.
The ESU Canine Unit maintains 36 dogs-handler teams which include three bloodhounds and several dogs cross-trained in cadaver recovery. The ESU canines are an integral part of the US-TF1 Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Team as deployed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Vehicles.
The Emergency Service Unit currently utilizes numerous vehicles including:
Recruitment.
The personnel selected for ESU become highly trained, elite members of the NYPD who perform rescue, SWAT and other high risk tactical, counter-narcotic and counter-terror operations.
There are minimum time-in-grade requirements before an NYPD officer can apply to transfer to ESU. Police Officers must have a minimum of 5 years on the job with a minimum annual rating of 3.5. Supervisors in the rank of sergeants and lieutenants must have 2 years in rank before being assigned to ESU. In addition, all ESU candidates must be approved by a group of current ESU members to ensure that they will integrate into the unit successfully.
Casualties/line of duty deaths.
ESU lost more members (14 out of 23 NYPD officers) than any other NYPD unit during the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001.

Email Ideas was founded in 2000 by Rick Sears, and later merged with iPlenus Solutions to form the Cannon-Sears Group, the new holding company of both divisions. The company's signature product, initially called an eCard, was changed to Bojo, meaning “greetings/best wishes” to reflect expansion into blogging and social networking in addition to professional markets.
History.
Email Ideas.
In 2000, Rick Sears founded Email Ideas out of Wilmington, North Carolina. The company began building eCards for local businesses. eCard creation and maintenance was manual.
Cannon-Sears Group.
In August 2006, Email Ideas merged with Johnson City, Tennessee-based web solutions provider iPlenus, forming the holding company The Cannon-Sears Group. iPlenus founder John Cannon assumed the role of President & CEO over both divisions of the company.
Over the next several years, the company's creative and technical teams worked to automate eCard creation, facilitating installation in most email environments. A strong foothold for the product was found in the real estate market, where Email Ideas quickly became a preferred vendor for Exit Realty, Prudential Real Estate, and Weichert Realty.
In October 2006 Email Ideas released their automated system, which allowed customers to customize and install their own eCards with the ease that had been lacking in previous years.
Following a period of rapid growth, Matrix Strategies privately invested in May 2007 for additional product development. 
Real estate expert Rick DeLuca began promoting Email Ideas in February 2008 as a part of his nationwide seminar programs.
Elizabeth Ward Small, acclaimed real estate success, started promoting Email Ideas in her own seminar tours in May 2008. 
The following month, in June 2008, Email Ideas officially branded eCards under the name “Bojo”.
Products.
Email Ideas' flagship product, the Bojo, is a personalized HTML email signature that can include contact info, a portrait, and live links to websites and social tools.
The Bojo has undergone many design changes in its history, becoming more stylized as additional capabilities are added and per user request. 
In February 2007, TextMe service became available. Clicking the TextMe button on a Bojo will send a text message to the owner's cell phone, facilitating communication and immediate mobile feedback.
Email Ideas changed their business model in March 2008, shifting away from a purchase-to-use structure and moving toward an ad-supported use-for-free model. This follows in line with their growth into the blogging/social networking community, and expands the market to include non-business use as well.
In August 2008, Email Ideas released their ePaster software—a floating icon that pastes Bojos into blogs, social networking sites, websites, documents, emails, and other HTML-enabled programs. The next month, a Bojo widget entered Beta phase, with a goal of automating pasting into social networking sites.
Summer 2009 will see the launch of Bojo Studio, a graphical user interface (GUI) for editing the shape, colors, text, background, and order of each field on the Bojo.

Ken Mink

Ken Paul Mink (born 1935) is an American who, at the age of 73, is believed to be the oldest person ever to score in a college basketball game. Mink sank two free throws for Roane State Community College (in Harriman, Tennessee) in their game against King College on November 3, 2008.
Background.
Mink, a resident of Knoxville, Tennessee, attended Lees College in Jackson, Kentucky, in the 1950s, where he played varsity basketball. In the fall of 1956, when he was a sophomore, he left the college. Mink says he left because he was expelled for a campus prank that he did not commit. He subsequently joined the U.S. Air Force, serving for four years. After leaving the Air Force he began a 38-year career as a journalist. He was an editor with the "Knoxville News Sentinel" (Knoxville, Tennessee) from 1972 to 1985, the "Kingsport Times" (Kingsport, Tennessee) from 1985 to 1988, and the "Harrisonburg Daily News Record" (Harrisonburg, Virginia) from 1988 to 1998, and began his retirement in 1999. Although he played basketball in military tournaments and recreation leagues, he did not resume his college athletic career until 2008, so he never used up his college eligibility.
Playing college basketball as a septuagenarian.
In 2007, Mink contacted several colleges in the Knoxville area to see if any would allow him to play basketball. Roane State coach, Randy Nesbit, expressed interest. Nesbit has said that he was curious about potential athletic performance of a septuagenarian who had kept himself in good physical condition. Mink enrolled as a student at Roane State and joined the team.
Mink was fouled in the game against King College, giving him the opportunity to shoot two free throws, scoring on both. He continued to participate as a member of Roane State's 2008–2009 team, playing in seven games and scoring in three. On January 24, 2009, he scored a two-point field goal in a game against Hiwassee College, becoming the oldest person to ever score a field goal in a college basketball game. His participation on the Roane State team generated worldwide media attention and increased average attendance at Roane State's home games from about 100 to 400. Mink was ruled ineligible to play during the second semester and Roane State was forced to forfeit a game for using an ineligible player. Mink had failed a Spanish class during the first semester that resulted in the shortage of the 12-hour minimum credit hours. According to Mink, he was "administratively ineligible for the second semester because of a technical requirement regarding the reporting of an online course." Roane State appealed the ruling, noting that Mink successfully completed a course from Strayer University to achieve the required number of credits for the semester. However, the appeal was denied.
Mike Sutton, basketball coach for Tennessee Tech University, invited Mink to be a walk-on player for the 2010-11 season, but the NCAA told Sutton that Mink had no more NCAA college eligibility because of the 5-4 Rule, which requires NCAA athletes to complete their four years of eligibility in five-year period.
Controversy.
Wright Thompson of ESPN magazine did an in-depth article about Ken Mink called, "The Legend of Ken Mink". Upon doing the research for the article, Thompson found conflicting evidence regarding the alleged prank incident. Thompson contacted Mink's former roommate, team members, friends, and school faculty. Initially Wright could not find anyone who recollected the prank incident ever occurring. Thompson was finally able to find one person who corroborated Mink's story regarding the prank, however no one was named for being responsible for the prank.)
Other activities.
Mink is also the author of the books "So, You Want Your Kid to be a Sports Superstar" and "Hoops Dreamer: The Ken Mink Story". He and his wife, Emilia, edit an online travel magazine, "The Travelling Adventurer".

Banski Suhodol

Banski Suhodol () is a peak in the Pirin mountain, south-western Bulgaria. It is located in the northern part of Pirin on the main ridge. Its height is 2,884 m which ranks it on third place in Pirin after Vihren and Kutelo. 
To the south-east of Banski Suhodol on the main ridge is located Kutelo peak and the two peaks are linked by the Koncheto ridge - a dizzy karst ridge which on some places is only 70 cm wide.
On the main ridge to the north-west is situated a nameless peak from which to the north-east deviated the secondary karst ridge Koteshki Chal. From there the main ridge runs in west-northwest direction to the nearby Bayuvi Dupki peak.
The north-eastern slope of Banski Suhodol is a vertical 300-meter marble wall that lowers down to the cirque of the same name. There are a lot of places in the cirque where the snow remains the whole year, several karst caves have been discovered there.
The south-western slope drops down to the valley of the Vlahina river at 70°. Although that slope is not so steep as the north-eastern one, the displacement between the peak and the valley below is around 1,000 m and forms a dramatic view. In that direction there is a view to the main summit Vihren and the second in rank - Kutelo, the granite Hvoinati Vrah and Muratov Vrah as well as the secondary Sinanishki ridge with its cirques and ridges and the Vlahini Lakes with the marble peak Sinatitsa in the distance.

Hedgepeth–Williams case

Hedgepeth and Williams v. Board of Education, Trenton, NJ, also known as the Hedgepeth–Williams case, was a 1944 New Jersey Supreme Court decision in a legal action brought by two mothers, Gladys Hedgepeth and Berline Williams, who sued the Trenton, New Jersey, Board of Education over racial discrimination against their children, Leon Williams and Janet Hedgepeth. It was a precursor to the Brown v. Board of Education case that prohibited racial segregation of school systems throughout the United States.
History.
In September 1943, Leon Williams and Janet Hedgepeth, residents of Trenton’s Wilbur section, attempted to enter into their local neighborhood’s junior high school, Junior High No. 2. However, they were told an abrupt ‘no’. The school was “not built for Negroes” as the principal of the school at that time stated. In the 1940s, Junior High No. 2 was a predominantly white school with virtually no admission of African Americans. Although placement into schools in the Trenton School System is dependent upon the distance a student resides from the school, African American students prior to the outcome of the Hedgepeth–Williams case were forced to attend the all-black New Lincoln School. This school was located 2.5 miles away from the residence of both Leon Williams and Janet Hedgepeth. Outraged at the apparent racial discrimination exercised by Trenton’s school system, Gladys and Berline filed a lawsuit against the Trenton Board of Education.
Lawsuit.
The lawsuit was decided by the New Jersey Supreme Court on January 31, 1944. The court stated that Junior School No. 2 “unlawfully discriminated” against the students and were in a direct violation of statute N.J.S.A. 18:14-2. This statute states among other things that “it is unlawful for boards of education to exclude children from any public school on ground that they are of negro race”. Robert Queen represented the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.
Impact.
The Hedgepeth–Williams case was cited in the Supreme Court decision in the Brown v. Board of Education case on May 17, 1954. Ten years later, the Honorable Thurgood Marshall and his team of NAACP attorneys applied the Hedgepeth and Williams decision (the only state anti-segregation legal precedent in the Nation) to the successful litigation strategy used in the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka KS decision, which overturned the doctrine of “Separate but Equal” across the land.
The 1944 Hedgepeth and Williams decision also caused or contributed to other momentous changes (listed below) and influenced the creation of Affirmative Action law and policy in New Jersey:
In 1973, the Honorable Wynona Lipman, the first African American New Jersey State Senator, introduced a bill that was clearly influenced by the state Supreme Court’s Hedgepeth and Williams decision of 1944 and by its Booker decision of 1965. That bill became the state’s first law (NJSA 18A:36-20) requiring local school districts to remove segregation and all vestiges of discrimination in their educational policies and practices, and to act affirmatively to provide equal opportunity for all students and staff in the district. In 1975, to implement this new law, the state Board of Education issued regulations governing Equality in Educational Programs (NJAC 6:4), to enforce equity compliance in all NJ public schools.
The importance of Hedgepeth and Williams is documented by the following sources, among others:
In 1991, the Trenton NJ Board of Education renamed the former “white-only” Junior High School #2, from which African American students had been barred. It was renamed the Hedgepeth-Williams School, in honor of the two special women whose courage and hard work has been of so much benefit to so many others over so many years.

Millhead Stream

The Millhead Stream is a minor tributary of the River Lea. The stream flows north to south across the Waltham Abbey flood plain and through the site of the former Royal Gunpowder Mills.
History.
The stream is an engineered watercourse which is part of an intricate five mile canal system within the Gunpowder Mills establishment and is fed by water from the River Lea. It provided the main power source for water driven mills in the area before the first gunpowder mills were recorded in 1662. The stream was also used for the smooth and safe delivery of raw materials and collection of gunpowder. 
Due to its location the stream remained largely unseen for over 300 years until the site was opened to the general public in 2001. 
Course.
The stream leaves the Cornmill Stream to flow through the Waltham Abbey Site of Special Scientific Interest within the Royal Gunpowder Mills site, before flowing through late 20th century housing developments. After passing under the B194 road at Highbridge Street the stream merges with the River Lea to flow under the A121 road to join the River Lee Flood Relief Channel below the town of Waltham Abbey.
Public access.
The stream can be seen at Beaulieu Drive close to the entrance of the Gunpowder Mills site. Within the site, where the stream passes through the SSSI access is restricted and can be visited by land train only.

Alfred Hope Patten (17 November 1885, Town Brewery, Sidmouth - 11 August 1958, The College, Little Walsingham), known as Pat to his friends, was an Anglo-Catholic priest in the Church of England, best known for his restoration of the shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham.
Life.
An introspective only child, he became an Anglo-Catholic in Brighton whilst still a teenager, becoming interested in not only the medieval church but also the religious life, visiting the Anglican Benedictines at Painsthorpe in 1906 and being profoundly influenced by their abbot, Aelred Carlyle. After attending Lichfield Theological College he was ordained deacon in 1913 at Holy Cross Church in the St Pancras area. After three other curacies, including the Good Shepherd church, Carshalton, in 1921 he became vicar of Great and Little Walsingham with St Giles' Houghton. Within months of arriving, he had a statue of Our Lady of Walsingham modelled on the medieval priory's seal and placed it in the parish's main church, St Mary's. He also started Marian devotions in his church and - aided by the League of Our Lady (later the Society of Mary) - the first pilgrimages from London. His bishop opposed the statue and Hope agreed to move it out of the church, using this as a chance to rebuild the Holy House in 1931 (rebuilt in 1938 to accommodate rising pilgrim numbers). On his death he was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's.

Ideational apraxia

Ideational apraxia (IA) is a neurological disorder which explains the loss of ability to conceptualize, plan, and execute the complex sequence of motor actions involving the use of tools or objects in everyday life. Ideational apraxia is a condition in which an individual is unable to plan movement related to an object because he has lost the perception of the object's purpose. Characteristics of this disorder include a disturbance in the idea of sequential organization of voluntary actions. The patient appears to have lost the knowledge or thought of what an object represents. This disorder was first seen one hundred years ago by Doctor Arnold Pick, who explained one specific patient that appeared to have lost their ability of object usage. When using an item such as a comb several errors were produced e.g., combing the hair with the wrong side of the comb or placing a pistol in his mouth. From that point on several other 
researchers and doctors have stumbled upon this unique disorder. IA has been described under several names such as, agnosia of utilization, conceptual apraxia or loss of knowledge about the use of tools, or semantic amnesia of tool usage. The term apraxia was first created by Steintha in 1871 and was then applied by Gogol, Kusmaul, Star, and Pick to patients who failed to pantomime the use of tools. It was not until the 1900s when Liepmann refined the definition so that it specifically described disorders that involved motor planning rather than disturbances in the patient’s visual perception, language, or symbolism.
Signs and symptoms.
Liepmann was the first to actually conduct tests to these patients in his laboratory. These tests are known as multiple object tasks or MOT. The tasks involve more than one object with the research describing a task to the patient and having them execute what was described to them. Liepmann gave the patients all the necessary articles, a candle and a matchbox, which are laid in front of the patient. He then observed the patients to see how they interacted with each object. In the case of the matchbox the patient brought the whole box up to the wick, instead of simply taking one match out. Or he takes the box from the case, removes a match, and brings it up to the wick unlighted. Another example would be that the patient takes the candle and actually strikes it against the frictional surface of the matchbox. As Liepmann watched he was able to witness the discontinuity of the patients actions with everyday objects. He was able to categorize the errors that these patients produced: mislocation of actions, object misuse, omissions, perplexity, and sequence errors.
But what should be noted is that even though these patients are unable to perform simple to multiple tasks with items that are given to them they are still able to accurately identify objects through a few simple tasks. Patients were able to match a given sequence of photographs with the correct label such as: the process of making coffee, buttering bread, or preparing tea. These patients are also able to successfully identify objects when a researcher verbally describes the function of the tool. Another test that was used was matching the appropriate object with its function. Lastly, the final test that shows that these patients completely understand object usage is that they could recognize the actions of a given tool by a sequence of photographs.
Therefore, the defect is not whether the patients have a lack of knowledge in the usage of an object. The patients completely understand the function of each tool. The problem lies in that the patients, when given an object, can not produce the correct function with the tool. The actual execution of a multiple object task is flawed.
Diagnosis.
Ideational apraxia is a difficult disorder to diagnose. That is because the majority of individuals who have this disorder almost always have some other type of dysfunction such as agnosia or aphasia. The tests used to make an IA diagnosis can range from easy single object tasks to complex multiple object tasks. When being tested a patient may be asked to view twenty objects. They then have to demonstrate the use of each single object following three different ways of presenting the stimuli. The patient must then perform complex test where the examiner describes a task such as making coffee and the patient must show the sequential steps that makes a cup of coffee. The patients are then scored on how many errors are seen by the examiner. The errors of the patients in performing the MOT were scored according to a set of criteria partly derived from De Renzi and Lucchelli.
Error classes.
Two classes of errors are used to develop a diagnosis:
Class I: Sequence errors
Class II: Conceptual errors
As the examiner observes the patient for each task they mark off which errors were committed. From this criteria the examiner will be able to focus on severity of the dysfunction. It is important to express that the motor movement is not lost in patients with IA. Yet, at first glance their movements may appear to be awkward because they are unable to plan a sequence of movements with the given object.
Cause.
The cause of IA is still somewhat of a mystery to most researchers. That is because there is no localized focal point in the brain that shows where this deficit will occur. Since 1905 Liepmann proposed a hypothesis of an action processing system that is found in the left hemisphere of the brain, which is dedicated to skilled, motor planning that guides the movement of the body. Yet, he still was never able to produce two patients with the same brain damage that showed ideational apraxia. The major ideas of where IA is found are in the left posterior temporal-parietal junction. Possibly damage to the lateral sulcus also known as Sylvian fissure may contribute to an individual’s deterioration of object recognition. Another possible area of damage leading to IA is the submarginal gyrus, which is located in the parietal lobe of the brain. Overall, IA is an autonomous syndrome, linked to damage in the left hemisphere involving semantic memory disorders rather than a defect in motor control.
Several severe injuries or diseases can cause IA in a wide range of patients. Alzheimer’s patients are the largest cohort groups that express IA. Other groups that are often seen with this dysfunction are stroke victims, traumatic brain injuries, and dementia. Interestingly, the damage is almost found in the dominant hemisphere of the patient. With that said many of these victims have the damage localized to their left hemisphere.
Pathophysiology.
Ideational apraxia is characterized by the mechanism that the patient loses the “idea” of how they should interact with an object. Norman and Shallice came up with the dual-systems theory of the control of routine and willed behavior. According to this theory one system –contention scheduling is responsible for the control of routine action, while – supervisory attention is able to bias this system when willed control over the behavior is required.
Contention scheduling is a complicated set of processes that involve action schemas. These action schemas are what are used in the sequence of actions involved in making a cup of tea and situation specific factors such as whether a glass of lemonade is too bitter. Even simple tasks need the monitoring of goals: e.g., has sugar been added to a cup of coffee.
But as we learn new activities we are also learning new schemas. We all know how to open a jar of jelly or how to light a match. Schemas are needed in everyday life because they give purpose and goal to our behaviors. In each schema there are subgoals or components that make up the schema. An example would be the schema of lighting a match. There are three subgoals found in this schema: holding the match, holding the matchbox, and holding a lit match. More subgoals could be applied but those are the most obvious when the overall goal wanted is to light a match. That is why schemas form a hierarchy, with the more complicated and complex action sequences corresponding to high level schemas and low level schemas correlating with simple single object tasks.
As said earlier from Norman and Shallice the other component used in voluntary action is supervisory attention. Schemas cause the activation of behaviors; the greater the excitation of the activity the more easily it is to achieve the subgoals and complete the schema. Either top-down fashion activates schemas, where intentions are governed by some type of cognitive system, or by bottom-up fashion where features or an object in the environment trigger a schema to begin. The bottom-up feature is what is seen in ideational apraxia because an object appears to capture the attention of the patient. However, the schema that corresponds to the object cannot be fulfilled. For some reason there is a disconnect in the brain that does not allow the individual to produce the sequence of actions that they know should be happening with the object that is in their visual pathway. It is this area that is still an area of ambiguity to physicians and researchers alike. They are not sure where in the brain the action schema pathway is severed.
Therapy.
Ideational apraxia at the moment has no real recovery. However, Occupational/Physical Therapy may be able to slow the progression and help patients regain some functional control, with the treatment approach being the same as that of ideomotor apraxia. The onset of this disorder is established because of damage to the brain. The only real recoveries seen are found in stroke patients or young patients. The reason for this occurrence is that plasticity of the brain allows for these damaged regions to remap themselves. Therefore, as the patients develop new behaviors to cope with their apraxia their brain’s functioning neurons are able to grow over the areas of dead or damaged cortical tissue.
In some cases the apraxia just vanishes as fast as it appeared. In those cases the patients were not diagnosed with a severe impairment such as traumatic brain injury or Alzheimer. This disorder is becoming a major problem in nursing homes because as the disease progresses and becomes more severe their apraxia worsens. It reaches to the point that patients are unable to feed themselves because of not being able to use simple utensils. Everything must be done for the patients because they have no recollection how objects should be properly used.
With the help of brain imaging such as fMRI, EEG, and PET scans and more research, this disorder may be localized to a specific area of the brain. From that point, new therapies could be developed to help with patients cope with their disorder.

Albany Theatre

The Albany is a multi-purpose arts centre in Deptford, south-east London.
Facilities include a flexible performance space holding up to 300 seated or 600 standing and a bar, two studio theatres, a performance cafe and rehearsal / meeting rooms. The Albany currently hosts a varied programme of events including music, spoken word, theatre, club nights, and children's shows. Several arts and community organisations are based at the Albany including spoken word promoters Apples & Snakes and Heart n Soul who provide opportunities for artists with learning disabilities.
History.
The original Albany Institute was opened in 1899 by its namesake, the Duchess of Albany. A daughter-in-law of Queen Victoria, the Duchess was an active patron of the Deptford Fund - a project founded to help women secure employment away from the dangerous local trades in the slaughterhouses. The Fund soon expanded its scope and the Institute was built to house the various activities that supported and involved a local population with high levels of poverty and deprivation.
It was not until the early 1970s that a touring theatre company became resident at the Albany and the organisation began to focus on fusion between community work and the arts.
In the 1970s it hosted fifteen Rock Against Racism gigs and Dire Straits performed there 2 July 1978. 
On 14 July 1978, the Albany's theatre, then called "Albany Empire", was destroyed by fire, the cause of which has never been established. Plans were put in place for a new purpose-built building incorporating theatre spaces, a cafe, community rooms and offices. This new building on Douglas Way was officially opened by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1982.
During the 1980s the Albany hosted performances by many well-known artists, including Elvis Costello, Squeeze, Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, Julian Clary, Courtney Pine and the Jazz Warriors. The building was also home to many social, creative and community organisations.
Cuts in public funding in the 1990s meant the arts programme had to be scaled back. However in 2001 the Royal National Theatre's Art of Regeneration initiative invested heavily in the organisation, enabling refurbishment of the building by Sprunt Architects to be completed and the re-establishment of a programme of performances.
Charles Hayward, an experimental rock musician, organised a series of performances at the theatre under the name "Accidents + Emergencies".

White House Jewish Liaison

The White House staff position of liaison to the American Jewish community (popularly known as the White House Jewish Liaison) is a role charged with serving as a presidential administration's voice to the community and gathering the community's consensus viewpoint on issues affecting it for the benefit of White House policymakers. It has existed at least as early as the Carter Administration.
At times, the post has operated within the White House Office of Public Liaison (now called the Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental affairs), and its formal title has depended on the rank of the person holding it. Thus, liaisons have held the position of Administrative Assistant for Jewish Affairs, Special Adviser for Jewish Affairs, Deputy-Chief-of-Staff for Jewish Affairs, or Director of Jewish Outreach. As of mid-2013, the position's title is Associate Director for Jewish Outreach. At other times, the post has been held by persons outside of the Public Liaison Office.
The position is a difficult one to hold. The liaison must be in contact with Jewish organization leaders who believe that they should be able to interact with White House policymakers as the need arises. The liaison must also gather consensus from, and represent the Administration to, an American Jewish community that is deeply divided on many major issues, including foreign policy, such as the method of achieving Mideast peace, and domestic policy, like school vouchers and aid to parochial schools.
In recent years, the position has regularly been handled by younger staffers holding their first jobs in the executive branch, with little power, and frequently many years younger than the leaders to whom they represent the Administration viewpoint.
Liaisons.
Carter Administration.
In 1978, Carter administration Jewish liaison Mark Siegel resigned the position after he became distressed with the administration's position towards Israel and Middle East policy and felt unable to influence it.
Reagan Administration.
Marshall Breger was President Ronald Reagan's Jewish liaison. He was involved in explaining to White House chief of staff Donald Regan why Jews were angry over Reagan's 1985 visit to a Bitburg, West Germany cemetery that included the graves of Waffen-SS soldiers. The position was a strong one in the Reagan and Clinton administrations; the position was shuffled relatively more often during the George W. Bush administration.
Clinton Administration.
Jay Footlik was a Jewish liaison during the Clinton Administration and later was a candidate for Congress in Illinois's 10th congressional district, losing to Dan Seals in the primary in 2008.
George W. Bush Administration.
During the Bush Administration, seven people held the position of White House Liaison to the Jewish community.
The first liaisons during the Bush Administration, including Adam Goldman, HHS Deputy Secretary Tevi Troy, and others, were said to have angered more liberal leaders of American Jewish organizations by allegedly bypassing their counsel in favor of more conservative Jews, functioning as a gatekeeper.
Additional Jewish Liaisons in the Bush White House included researcher and scheduler Jeff Berkowitz; staff assistant Jay Zeidman, the son of U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum Council chair Fred Zeidman; speechwriter Noam Neusner, son of Jacob Neusner, a prominent rabbi and author; and special policy assistant to the President Jeremy Katz. Troy left to work on the Bush 2004 reelection campaign, while both Berkowitz and Zeidman left to join 2008 Republican presidential campaigns.
The last liaison of the Bush Administration was Scott Arogeti.
Obama Administration.
During the Presidential transition of Barack Obama, at least five candidates were interested in the position. The post was initially co-held by Susan Sher, chief of staff to the First Lady, and Danielle Borrin, who holds the position of Special Assistant for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement to Vice President Joe Biden. However, Sher left the White House in January 2011.
In September 2011, it was announced that Jarrod Bernstein would be joining the White House Office of Public Engagement as the Director of Jewish Outreach. After Bernstein stepped down in January 2013, the role was handled on an interim basis by Zach Kelley, before being assigned to Matt Nosanchuk. Nosanchuk had previously held the position of Senior Counsel in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, where he worked on DOMA litigation. Nosanchuk's title as Jewish Liaison is Associate Director for Jewish Outreach in the White House Office of Public Engagement.

The Incomparable Max

The Incomparable Max is a play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. It is based on the stories "Enoch Soames" and "A.V. Laider" in "Seven Men" by Max Beerbohm.
Enoch Soames is a minor poet who makes a pact with the devil to spend a few hours in the library of the British Museum one hundred years in the future to learn how history will regard him. There he finds the only mention of his name is in a short story written by Max Beerbohm. A.V. Laider is a palmist who foretells the death of four people riding on a train - or does he? 
The play had its premiere at the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia in 1969. The Broadway production, directed by Gerald Freedman, began the first of ten previews on October 9, 1971 at the Royale Theatre. It opened on October 19 and closed on November 6 after 23 performances.
The cast included Richard Kiley in the dual roles of Soames and Laider and Clive Revill as Beerbohm. Constance Carpenter and Fionnuala Flanagan appeared in supporting roles. 
The creative team included costume designer Theoni V. Aldredge and lighting designer Martin Aronstein. 
T.E. Kalem of "Time" observed, "The work is a glue job rather than an organic entity. The authors . . . awkwardly mixed Beerbohm in as a character among his own creations. In passages that are almost unrelated asides, they have Max as drama critic quoting himself on plays, players and playgoers. These comments lack the pithy bite of aphorisms, and as out-of-context fragments, they lose much of the slyly inflected wit that is one of the special pleasures of reading Beerbohm . . . The deeper problem lies with Max himself, who was too much the fastidious dandy, too much the meticulous stylist, to serve as a vehicle for the broad, boisterous traffic of the stage."

HIV Clinical Resource

History and purpose.
HIV Clinical Resource was established in 1999 as a collaborative effort between the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute (NYSDOH AI) and the Johns Hopkins University Division of Infectious Diseases.
In recognition of the complex, multiple needs of New York State’s HIV-infected population, including HIV transmission risk factors, demographic-specific issues, as well as New York State HIV-related policies and programs, the NYSDOH AI established clinical guidelines to assist New York State healthcare providers in treating their HIV-infected patients and referring them to other HIV-related services. The NYSDOH AI also recognized the need to provide standards of care for its residents because of the large number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the state. In 2006, New York State reported the highest number of new cases of AIDS (5,495), as well as the highest number of residents living with AIDS (177,262).
The program provides HIV-related clinical information, including:
Clinical guidelines.
The general purpose of clinical practice guidelines is to assist in clinical decisions by providing recommendations that are based on a review of available clinical evidence, such as the results of clinical trials. However, clinical trials often take years to complete. With advances in medicine outpacing available data from clinical trials, treatment recommendations are often established through review of case reports, epidemiologic investigations, and committee consensus. These procedures shift the burden of evidence review from individual providers to the expert opinion of committees with the aim of improving quality of care.
As part of HIV Clinical Resource, the NYSDOH AI HIV Clinical Guidelines program addresses the medical management of adults, adolescents, and children with HIV infection; and primary and secondary prevention in medical settings. It also includes informational brochures for care providers and the public. The NYSDOH AI has established committees of clinicians and other care providers who serve people with HIV infection to address relevant topics and to regularly assess and update current recommendations, as well as develop new guidelines in accordance with emerging clinical and research developments. These committees include:
Consumer input.
In addition to evidence-based medicine, research has demonstrated that “patient-centered medicine” is an emerging aspect to clinical practice. Patients’ experience and preferences are becoming prominent considerations in the provision of treatment. The HIV Clinical Guidelines program seeks input from the consumer advisory committee as part of an effort to include patients’ experience in the guidelines development process.
Each guideline is reviewed by consumers.

Lawrence E. Glendenin

Lawrence Elgin Glendenin (November 8, 1918November 22, 2008) was an American chemist who co-discovered the element promethium.
Biography.
Glendenin was born in Bay City, Michigan on November 8, 1918. He attended the University of Chicago, graduating in 1941.
Clinton Laboratories.
He worked as a chemist at the Clinton Laboratories (now Oak Ridge National Laboratory) during the World War II Manhattan Project, engaged in separating, identifying and characterizing the radioactive elements produced by nuclear fission. In 1945, he, together with Jacob A. Marinsky and Charles D. Coryell, isolated the previously undocumented rare earth element 61. Marinsky and Glendenin produced promethium both by extraction from fission products and by bombarding neodymium with neutrons. They isolated it using ion-exchange chromatography. Publication of the finding was delayed until later due to the war. In September 1947, Marinsky and Glendenin announced the discovery at a meeting of the American Chemical Society. Upon the suggestion of Coryell's wife, the team named the new element for the titan Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and was punished for the act by Zeus. They had also considered naming it "clintonium" for the facility where it was isolated.
Szilárd Petition.
In 1945, Glendenin and 154 other Manhattan Project scientists signed the Szilárd petition. The petition urged President Harry S. Truman not to use the first atomic bomb "without restriction," urging him instead to "describe and demonstrate" its power and give Japan "the opportunity to consider the consequences of further refusal to surrender."
Late Career.
In 1949, Glendenin earned his Ph.D from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That same year he joined Argonne National Laboratory, where he remained until his retirement in 1985.
He published extensively on the properties of fission products. He served as Scientific Secretary on the U.S. delegation to the Atoms for Peace Conference and received the American Chemical Society's Glenn T. Seaborg Award for Nuclear Chemistry in 1974.
Family and Death.
Glendenin was married for 63 years to Ethel Glendenin (née Long), who survived him at his death in November 2008. The couple were the parents of two daughters and one son.

European Schoolnet

European Schoolnet or EUN is a network of 30 European Ministries of Education, based in Brussels. EUN was created in 1997 with the aim of bringing innovation in teaching and learning to its key stakeholders, these being Ministries of Education, schools, teachers and researchers.
Policy, research and innovation.
European Schoolnet works on how ICT can support change in teaching and learning. Together with its members, EUN identifies evidence, best practice and emerging priorities in education in Europe. The organisation produces country reports which highlight the major trends and policies in today’s education systems in terms of ICT. Through various research projects and networks of pilot schools and local coordinators across Europe, European Schoolnet carries out studies on topics such as the use of games in schools, internet safety, use of learning objects and many other topics.
School services.
European Schoolnet works as a European platform for schools to achieve effective use of technologies in teaching and learning, promote the European dimension in education, develop new pedagogical approaches and equip teachers and learners with new skills and raise interest in subjects such as maths, science and technology. Many thousands of schools are engaged in our programmes. European Schoolnet has particularly worked on enhancing cooperation across Europe between schools, as the coordinator of the EU's eTwinning Central Support Service and the promotion of the European dimension in education (myEurope, Spring Day for Europe).
Learning Resource Exchange.
The Learning Resource Exchange (LRE) from European Schoolnet is a service that enables schools to find educational content from many different countries and providers. It includes content from Ministries of Education (MoE) and other partners that have participated with European Schoolnet (EUN) in EC-funded projects such as CALIBRATE, MELT and ASPECT projects and is now being carried forward in current projects such as iTEC and eQNet and with support from the LRE’s content partners.
Anyone is able to browse content in the LRE federation of repositories and teachers that register can also use LRE social tagging tools, rate LRE content, save their favourite resources and share links to these resources with others.

Count of Abrantes

Count of Abrantes (in Portuguese "Conde de Abrantes") was a Portuguese title of nobility created by a royal decree, dated from June 13, 1476, by King Afonso V of Portugal, and granted to his 4th cousin, Lopo de Almeida.
"Dom" Lopo was close related to the Portuguese royal House, once his great-grandfather was Infante João, Duke of Valencia de Campos (son of King Peter I of Portugal and of Inês de Castro).
This title became extinct when the 4th Count, Miguel de Almeida, a hero of the Portuguese uprising of December 1, 1640, died without issue in 1650.
Family Name.
The family name associated with the Counts of Abrantes was "Almeida".
The Almeida clan was closely associated with King John II of Portugal played a pivotal role in the 1490s succession crisis, strongly backing John II's preferred candidate, Jorge de Lencastre against the eventual winner, Manuel, Duke of Beja.
According to Subrahmanyam (1997: 49), Lopo de Almeida, the first Count of Abrantes, had at least six notable sons:
The Almeida clan remained the principal political opponents of Manuel I of Portugal throughout his reign.

American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing

American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing is a form of dance oriented to spontaneous individual dancing, where self-expression and creativity are expected.
Contrasts of American traditional dance styles.
Traditional dance in America has various contrasting aspects and schools of practice:
Filling the later case for each of those aspects is American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing. This category includes Flat Foot Dancing (AKA Flat-Footing), Hoofing (AKA Hoofin'), Buck Dancing, Soft Shoe (casual tap dancing performed in shoes without metal taps), Clogging (in its older non-show form), Irish Sean-Nós Dance, and the Irish Jig. (Various other names may be applied for this category of dance, depending upon the specific regional, language, cultural, or social group.)
Traditional couples and group social dance forms such as Cakewalk Dance, Square Dance, Hoedown, Line Dance, or Contra Dance might have interludes of this solo form of dancing between those dances.
More modern American dance styles—including those oriented to performance (such as Vaudeville and Tap Dance), competitive (such as Irish Stepdance and Ballroom Dance), or other forms commonly studied at dance schools—may employ some of these same steps. However, those modern dances are more likely to emphasize steps oriented towards showmanship or correctness of form.
Informality of American vernacular solo dance.
The distinguishing characteristics of the American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing are that it can be done spontaneously, with creativity and self-expression, and may involve only one person. The foot need not be lifted very high off the ground for this form of dance, but the skill and physical exertion required can still be demanding. Even if musical accompaniment is not present, the sound of the foot contacting the dance surface provides a rhythm of its own.
While showmanship cannot be totally divorced from this form of dance, the emphasis is more upon making the dance appear almost effortless. This dance style is adaptable by those who are physically limited in some way—yet can provide significant exercise. These traditional dance forms exist outside generational bounds and can be enjoyed by the youngest of children or those more advanced in years.
Often only a small dance area is required, as the dancer need not travel far from the central spot where the dance is started. Sometimes the dance is done on a table top, a door taken off the hinges, a board placed between two supports, or even on the limited area of the top of a stool. No specialized facilities, props, or clothing are required—other than a pair of sturdy shoes (plain sole, without taps).
Roots and regions where prevalent.
Significant influences on these traditional styles in America include the traditions of African, European, English, Irish, Scottish, and Native American dance. Irish Dance includes a traditional informal freeform solo style known as Sean Nós or "old style". Sean-nós dance in America has been a significant influence on solo Southern dancing and solo mountain-style dancing.
The regions where this form of dance is most commonly found roughly parallels the geographic area of Appalachia, the Ozarks, or other regions where the isolation and rough topography impeded the encroachment of more modern forms. These regions coincide with Colonial frontier areas where America's earlier English settlers found the land less desirable and subsequently were more available for newer immigrants. Thus there is a stronger influence of the Irish and Scottish peoples in those regions from their migration during Colonial and later eras.
Sean-nós dance in America has made a significant contribution to the American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing that includes Hoofing (AKA Hoofin'), Buck Dancing, Soft Shoe, Clogging (in its older non-show form), and the Irish Jig. (Various other names may be applied for this category of dance, depending upon the specific regional, language, cultural, or social group.) Solo Southern dancing and Solo mountain-style dancing show strong influences from sean-nós dance.
I believe that to get some idea of the process of Southern vernacular dance development, we must consider it in parallel with its companion music and the dominant cultures that have mixed to produce it: British, African, and to some extent, Native American. These cultures began their intense musical interaction here in the 17th century, ﬁrst among African-Americans and then in the 19th century among British-Americans, especially in small Southern towns and nearby rural areas. A good example of Anglo/Afro interaction in music is the introduction of the banjo, originally an African instrument. It is quite certain that the interaction between the European ﬁddle and African banjo changed the styles and repertoire of both. African-Americans ﬁrst played these instruments together soon after being brought here, and the banjo/ﬁddle combination was the basis for the late 19th-century/early 20th-century mountain music to which most of our older dancers moved.

Popularity.
Because this form of dance is not commonly found on stage, in the media, or taught in dance schools, it has received less attention and its practice is significantly diminished compared to its past popularity. Institutional means of preserving this sub-category of dance include through the activities of folk festivals, documentarians, folklorists, ethno-musicologists, dance schools, and performance troupes. Isolated pockets of practitioners may choose to pass this down, if the younger generations step up to learning the dance form.
