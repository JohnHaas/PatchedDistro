Highlander Challenge World Championships

The Highlander Challenge World Championships (or more simply the Highlander Challenge or Gododdin Highlander Challenge) is a tournament that marries traditional Highland Games with more contemporary strength athletics. It was created to help reinvigorate Highland Games in Scotland by giving a modern and aspirational image while maintaining the tradition inherent in the history of the sport.
History.
Highland Games has a long and distinguished history in Scotland. It was once claimed to be the biggest spectator sport in the country after football and as a format has been exported around the globe. In particular, it has been very successful in North America. However, in its native land some well informed commentators began to note that it was attracting small crowds, the format was deemed tired and the number of traditional heavy competitors was dwindling at once well attended gatherings.
Dr Douglas Edmunds, the co-founder of the World's Strongest Man, but more pertinently a former world caber-tossing champion, determined to reinvigorate the sport in his native Scotland. Along with his son, Gregor Edmunds the 2007 winner of the World Highland Games Championships, he set about organizing a new competition that would attract some of the top names from the world from such disciplines as Highland Games, strength athletics, powerlifting and field athletics. He said "Gimmicky strength events, like truck-pulling, we feel are inappropriate when Scotland has such a magnificent history…Sadly, some games have poor quality athletes, bad equipment, and poor quality commentary with little crowd interaction. We aim to change that."
Thus was spawned the Highland Challenge. Invitees to the tournament had to meet hig criteria, being either national champions, Olympians, world record-holders, World Highland games champions, World's Strongest Man finalists, and US highland games champions. Having brought the earth of their homelands to the Moot Hill, in the same manner and place as allegiance was sworn to Scotland's ancient kings, contestants would enter a competition consisting of a mixture of traditional Highland Games events and more contemporary strongman tests in order to vie for the title of the "Chieftain's Champion".
The 2007 event saw Sebastian Wenta win the competition and having sampled some success the next games were planned for 2008. Douglas Edmunds managed to attract a number of sponsors for the 2008 event, as well as gaining an agreement with Channel 4 to televise the event. The 2008 event took place at Scone on 19 and 20 July 2008. Such was its success that a 2009 event was planned for immediately.
Events.
The events contested are designed to echo not only the traditions of the Highland Games but also the history of Scotland. They include wrestling, schiltron jousting and stone-lifting, as well as traditional throws, such as the caber. In addition, there are re-enactments of battles including in 2008 the 1396 Battle of the North Inch starring Hal o’ the Wynd.
In the 2008 contest a new event called ""The Whisky Plunder,"" (sponsored by The Famous Grouse) saw competitors racing with four casks. The Famous Grouse also sponsored the “Tossing the Caber” event, with winners toasting success with a Famous Grouse trophy and a personalised Gallon Bottle.
Past winners.
Final.
The Highlander Challenge was to begin on 26 May 2007 at Blair Castle, Scotland. The Games made up two half-hour episodes of the IFSA Strongman 26 programme television series. The event was also backed by Event Scotland and was conceived by Dr. Douglas Edmunds. It went by the name "Gododdin Challenge" in 2007. Sebastian Wenta edged out Gregor Edmunds by one-half point for the victory at the Gododdin Challenge at Blair Castle. Hjalti Arnason who watched the contest commented that this made for TV event would result in excellent shows and Mike Zolkiewicz, who finished fourth said that the blend of traditional Highland Games and strongman events "had great balance and it tested athletic ability beyond just a Highland Games or a strongman contest."
The final placings were:
2008 Event.
The 2008 finals were on 19 and 20 July at Scone Palace They were televised by Channel 4 and the announcer was Colin Bryce, an announcer on the World’s Strongest Man as well as a past competitor.
Competitors.
There were also a number of competitors who had been advertised as entrants but for a variety of reasons had to pull out:
Heat 1.
The competitors in the first heat were:
Chuprynin and Wenta dominated. Johannes Arsjo, in his first appearance in a highland event won the whisky plunder (a 320-kg barrel carry) in a time of 14.28 seconds and overcame heavier and more experienced competitors to win the wrestling bouts.
Heat 2.
The competitors in the second heat were:
Scott Rider was the overall winner, with winning throws in the stone putt and caber. David Barron winning the sheaf pitch and Sean Betz won the hammer with a throw of 139’ 8½”.
Final.
Sean Betz won both the hammer and 28-lb weight for distance. Zijlstra won the Famous Grouse Challenge Caber and Arsjo beat Rider in the pole push. The 56-lb weight for height saw no-one reach 17’ and was a three-way tie for first place between Arsjo, Wenta and Zijlstra. Going into the final event of the Pictish Stone Carry, Wenta had a 3 point lead over his closest challenger, Rider, but retained his title with by gaining a third place behind Edmunds and Arsjo.
The final placings were:
2009 Event.

Bassan tribe

The Bassan tribe (Basan) of the Ijaw people lives in western Bayelsa State, Nigeria. Bassan settlements include: Ezetu (I and II), Koloama (I and II), Sangana, Furupa, Ukubie, Lubia, Azuzuama, Akparatubo, and Ekeni.<br>
Unlike other Ijaw tribes, the Bassan do not have a cultural tradition of common origin. It is believed that each of the villages that make up the clan were settled by separate migrations. As a result, no form of central authority developed among the Bassan. Some of the villages forged temporary alliances; others quarreled with each other over land and fishing rights.<br>

Porter County Memorial Opera Hall

The Porter County Memorial Hall, also known as Memorial Opera House, is an historic Grand Army of the Republic memorial hall located in Valparaiso, Indiana. It was the meeting place of Chaplain Brown GAR Post No. 106, one of 592 GAR posts in Indiana. Designed in 1892 by a local architect, Charles F. Lembke., using Romanesque styling, it was built in 1892-3 to seat 100 people. It was also used as the local opera house.
Local legend says that Wm Jennings Bryan spoke at the hall during the 1896 presidential campaign. Others who have been to the hall include Theodore Roosevelt, John Phillips Sousa, Marx Brothers. Decline began with the advent of the movies, for which it was converted. By the time of World War II it was an abandoned building. Beginning in 1955, the Community Theatre Guild leased the property and began maintaining it once again for theater productions. The City restored the hall in the 1990s and leased it to the Memorial Opera House Company, where theater productions continue.
The Memorial Opera House is located at 104 Indiana Avenue just east of the historic Porter County Jail and Sheriff's House. At the time of construction, Indiana Avenue was called Mechanics Street. The Opera House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It was restored in 1998.Today, the Memorial Theatre Company produces six theatrical performances each year and host community concerts and other events.

MS Nautica

MS "Nautica" was built by Renaissance cruises as an "R" class cruise ship, she is owned and operated by Oceania Cruises where she is part of their Regatta Class. She was built in 2000 by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in St. Nazaire, France for Renaissance Cruises as MS "R Five". Between 2002 and 2004 she sailed for Pullmantur Cruises before entering service with her current owners in 2005.
On 30 November 2008 while sailing on the Gulf of Aden the "Nautica" came under attack by Somalian pirates, but was able to escape without any injuries to passenger or crew.
Concept and construction.
"R Five" was the fifth ship in a series of eight identical cruise ships built between 1998 and 2001 by Chantiers de l'Atlantique at St. Nazaire, France for Renaissance Cruises. Her keel was laid on 22 March 1999 and she was lanuched from drydock on 31 July 1999. Following fitting out, the "R Five" was delivered to Renaissance Cruises on 29 January 2000.
Service history.
On 1 February 2000 the "R Five" entered service with Renaissance Cruises on cruises in the Mediterranean. She stayed in service until 25 September 2001, when Renaissance Cruises was declared bankrupt due to financial difficulties caused by the September 11 attacks. Alongside six of her sister ships the "R Five" was laid up at Gibraltar. In December 2001 she was sold to the France-based Cruiseinvest and alongside her sisters was moved to Marseille, France for a further lay-up.
From June 2002 the "R Five" was chartered to the Spain-based Pullmantur Cruises for cruising for the Spanish market. In service with Pullmantur she was marketed under the name "Blue Dream", but her registered name remained unchanged. During the northern hemisphere winter seasons she sailed out of Brazilian port as a part of Pullmantur's joint service with CVC. "R Five" left service with Pullmantur in 2004.
In November 2005 the "R Five" re-entered service when she was chartered to Oceania Cruises and renamed "Nautica". On 30 November 2008 the "Nautica" was sailing from Safaga, Egypt to Salah, Oman on the Maritime Safety Protection Area established in the Gulf of Aden due to persistent pirate attacks on the area, when at approximately 9:28 AM UTC+3 the ship encountered two Somalian pirate skiffs. Captain Jurica Brajcic ordered the ship to take evasive manoeuvres and to sail away at flank speed. The "Nautica" was able to outrun her attackers, although the ship was fired at eight times. None of the 684 passengers or 401 crew onboard were injured in the attack. Following the attack the "Nautica" proceeded normally to her next scheduled port of call.

Withins Lane railway station was a closed station in Radcliffe, the site of which is now on the Manchester Metrolink Line.
History.
The railway line between Clifton and was planned by the Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway, which amalgamated with other companies as the East Lancashire Railway prior to the opening in September 1846. Originally there were no stations between and Bury; a station at Withins Lane was later built, but was only open for two brief periods: August 1847–May 1849 and February 1850–December 1851, during which it served the northern part of Radcliffe, and was a stopping point for trains operated via Clifton Junction. Since 1879 the area has been served by the station now known as Radcliffe Metrolink station.

HMS Weazel (1805)

HMS "Weazel" (frequently spelt Weazle, and occasionally Weasel) was a Royal Navy 18-gun , launched in 1805 at Topsham, Devon. She saw active service in and around the Mediterranean during the Napoleonic Wars resulting in her crews earning three clasps to the Naval General Service Medal, was decommissioned in 1815, and was sold for breaking in 1825.
Service.
1805-6.
"Weazel" entered service in 1805, under the command of Commander Peter Parker. Parker had been promoted to Master and Commander on 8 May 1804. On 21 August, Parker sailed "Weazle" to Cadiz, where he joined the British fleet under Lord Nelson. "Weazle" and , under Captain Henry Blackwood, watched the port for the exit of the Franco-Spanish fleet, and signaled to Nelson when they did. Much to Parker's disappointment, Nelson dispatched "Weazle" to bring back five British ships of the line that Nelson had sent up the straights of Gibraltar to water, and whose absence, and the consequent weakness of the English fleet, Nelson had hoped would draw the enemy out. "Weazel" therefore missed the battle of Trafalgar.
Admiral Collingwood appointed John Clavell, with a commission dated to 22 October 1805, the day after Trafalgar, in which Clavell had been wounded, to take command of "Weasel". (Clavell never fully recovered from his wound.) "Weazel" first monitored the Spanish fleet at Cartagena, Spain. She then patrolled Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Madeira, looking for Spanish privateers and men-of-war; subsequently she was stationed between Cape Spartel and Larache. From there "Weazel" transferred to the coast of Catalonia, where she captured the Spanish privateer "Secondo Cornelo", of eight guns, though pierced for 20, and also about 15 coasting vessels.
1807.
She then operated off Catalonia before serving in the Adriatic Sea and off Corfu at the start of the Adriatic campaign of 1807–1814. Clavell was visiting Corfu when word arrived that the island had been transferred from Russian control to France in the Treaty of Tilsit. Escaping from the newly arrived French garrison, "Weasel" captured or destroyed a number of French transports before bringing the news back to Malta.
On 4 March 1807, captured the ship "Istria". "Unité", , and "Weazle" were in company and shared in the prize money. "Melpomene" captured the Turkish vessel "Buona Esperanza" on 19 July and the "Bizzaro", on 21 August, with "Unité", and "Weazel" sharing by agreement. The bankruptcy of the prize agents meant that some prize money was not distributed until 21 years later, in 1828. The fourth and final payment for "Bizzarro" did not occur until July 1850. On 5 October "Weazle" captured the "Alida Georgiana".
1808.
On 4 February 1808, Henry Prescott was given command of "Weazel" and took command off Sardinia. Under his command "Weazel" took part in coastal operations off Italy and in hunting privateers in the Eastern Mediterranean. In August 1808 "Weazle" blockaded a convoy of 38 enemy vessels, of which four were large gunboats, in the port of Diamante, Calabria, south of the Gulf of Policastro, where they were protected by gun boats and a shore battery. The convoy was carrying contributions in kind from the two provinces of Calabria to the Neapolitan Government. 
Lieutenant General John Stuart, commander of British forces in Sicily, detached Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Bryce of the Royal Engineers, together with 250 troops from the Regiment of Malta, 150 troops from the 58th Regiment of Foot, 50 men of the German Legion, and an artillery detachment of two six-pounder guns and a howitzer. The naval force consisted of "Weazle", and Sicilian galiot under the command of the Chevalier de Balsamo.
Calms delayed the arrival of the troops for five days, for three of which the British forces were visible from the shore. Bryce reported that the town was well-situated for defence as it stood on a peninsula that was nearly inaccessible on three sides, the fourth was protected by "difficult Inclosures", and a building of "considerable Strength" commanded the whole.
On 9 September or early on 8 September, "Weazle", "Halcyon" and the galiot bombarded the building for several hours. The troops then landed on the morning of 8 September. They pushed back the defenders, who consisted of some French troops and 400 men of the civic guard. The defenders fled to mountains rather than trying to defend the town. Consequently, the British captured a battery of four guns, without suffering any casualties. They then captured the entire convoy, as well as a total of 20 guns, howitzers, carronades, and swivel guns, together with their ammunition. Before they left, the British destroyed the captured ordnance.
1809-1810.
On 27 October 1809, "Weazle" captured the French letter of marque "Veloce". "Veloce" was armed with four guns and had a crew of 83 men. She was four days out of Tunis and had not taken any prizes. Then on 25 December, "Weazle" captured "Eole", a French polacre-rigged privateer corvette after a nine-hour chase. PThough pierced for 20 guns, "Eole" was armed with 14 six and eight-pounder guns, and had a crew of 140 men. She resisted for an hour and a half, during which "Weazle" had one man killed and one seriously wounded, and "Eole" had five men killed and nine wounded before she struck. 
On 25 July 1810, the frigate , "Weazle", and "Weazle"s sister-ship captured or destroyed a convoy of 31 coasting vessels that were carrying stores and provisions from Naples to Murat's army at Scylla. Seven large gunboats, four scampavias, and an armed pinnace protected the convoy. At the approach of the British vessels, the convoy beached itself between two shore batteries near Amanthea. The gun-boats and other armed vessels, under the command of Capitaine de frégate Caraccioli, drew themselves up in a line for the protection of the former. While the British ships fired on the batteries, that boats from all three that came in to take the enemy vessels out came under intense small arms fire from the crews, who had fled ashore, and local troops. Even so, the British only lost one man killed and six men wounded, one of whom belonged to "Weazle". 
For his role in command of the boats, Prescott received promotion to post captain, with the date of his commission being the date of the action, though he did not get the news until February 1811. Lieutenant Collier from "Thames" received promotion to Commander. In 1847, the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp "Amanthea 25 July 1810" to the 23 surviving members of the British crews that claimed it.
1811-1812.
In 1811 command passed to John Strutt Peyton, who took "Weazel" to the Aegean Sea, operating off Smyrna. On 29 August, "Weazle" chased a French privateer xebec for eight hours before capturing her. The privateer was the "Roi de Rome" (or "Re di Roma"), armed with ten guns and carrying a crew of 46 men. She was under the command of "Enseigne de Vaisseau" M. Antoine Michel, Chevalier de l'Ordre Royal des Deux Sicilies. "Roi de Rome" was only six days out of Alexandria (and only 46 days from her launching) at the time of her capture. She had set out after seven English merchant vessels bound for Malta and had captured a Maltese bombard.
On 16 February 1812, "Weazel", commanded now by John William Andrew, joined the ship of the line HMS "Victorious" off the harbour of Venice. Together the ships awaited the completion and departure of the French ship of the line "Rivoli". On 22 February "Rivoli" left the harbour at the center of a squadron consisting of three brigs and two settee gunboats. In the subsequent Battle of Pirano, "Victorious" and "Weazel" chased and defeated "Rivoli" and her escorts. "Weazel" held off the small ships accompanying "Rivoli" and destroyed one, the brig "Mercure", which exploded, while "Victorious" defeated and captured "Rivoli".
Although casualties were heavy on both "Victorious" and "Rivoli", "Rivoli" lost some 400 men killed and wounded of her crew of over 400, "Weazel" sustained no casualties. Her unfortunate opponent "Mercure", lost all but three of her crew in the explosion that sank her. The action resulted in a promotion to post captain for Andrew. In February 1815 head money was paid out to both British vessels for the "Mercure". In October 1815 a second distribution of the prize money for "Rivoli" was paid out. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the NGSM with clasps "Victorious wh. Rivoli" and "Weasel 22 Feby. 1812" to the 67 and six surviving claimants from the action.
On 18 September "Weazle" captured the "Bella Candiotta". Commander James Black replaced Andrew in September, but apparently after this capture.
On 21 December and "Weazle" chased a trabaccolo until it took shelter under the tower of St. Cataldo, reputedly the strongest on the coast between Brindisi and Otranto. The tower had a telegraph, and was armed with three guns and three swivel guns. The next day a landing party from the two vessels captured the tower and blew it up. Unfortunately, the trabaccolo was unladen.
1813-1815.
"Weazel" remained in the Adriatic into 1813, assisting George Cadogan in HMS "Havannah" in his raiding campaign on the Italian coast. On 6 January 1813, the boats of and "Weazle" captured five armed French vessels sailing from Corfu to Otranto to convoy the payment for the troops on the island. The French resisted, but the British suffered no casualties. The five were:
Three days later, "Weazle" captured the "Madonna de Megaspilio". On 4 March, "Weazle" captured the "Sostegno".
On 22 April, "Weazle" was four miles ENE of the island of Zirona when she encountered a convoy close to the shore, making for the ports of Tran and Spalatro. "Weazle" gave chase, but the convoy split up, most of the vessels, including ten gunboats, heading for Boscaline Bay, between Tran and Marina. "Weazle" chased the gunboats, which around 6am formed a line, hoisted the French flag, and proceeded to fire on her. An all-day action ensued in which the French lost one gunboat sunk, two driven on shore, and three surrendered. However, four more enemy gunboats joined the action, as did shore batteries and troops on shore. "Weazle" further succeeded in burning and destroying eight vessels belonging to the convoy. The next morning the action resumed as "Weazle", holed, taking on water, and with all her sails and rigging destroyed, slowly attempted to warp out of range. "Weazle" was unable to disengage until the late afternoon of 24 April. "Weazle" had lost five men killed and twenty-four wounded, with slightly over half the wounded being severely wounded, and with most of the casualties having occurred on the first day. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp "Weasel 22 April 1813" to all surviving claimants from the action.
About a month later, on 24 May, the British sighted a French convoy sailing from Stagus to Cattaro. Rear Admiral Thomas Fremantle, who commanded British naval forces in the Adriatic, sent "Weazle" and the gun-brig after them. "Weazle" and "Haughty" captured or destroyed all six vessels in the convoy, suffering only one man wounded in the process. The six vessels were carrying grain.
On 22 July, "Weazel" and captured the Isle of Mezzo, which is about 15 kilometers northwest of Dubrovnik. There they captured six guns and 59 men.
During the night of 4 August, and "Weazel" put a landing party ashore on the back of the island of Ragonicz, off the Dalmatian coast. By next morning the British had scaled the heights of the highest point on the island. From there they were able to drive the French garrison out of a fortification on the island. The landing party captured and disabled six 24-pounder guns and two 7.5" mortars before the party returned to their vessels, without having suffered any casualties. 
Three weeks later, on 24 August, "Weazel" sighted five French gunboats that had left Fano and were sailing to Otranto. After a chase of six hours, "Weazel" was able to capture two, the other three escaping back to Fano. The two gunboats captured were the "Tonnante", of two guns and a crew of 40 men under the command of "Enseigne de Vaisseau;" M. Simon, and the "Auguste", also of two guns, with a crew of 27 men under the command of "Enseigne de Vaisseau;" M. N. Cranotich. The vessels also had on board 37 officers and non-commissioned officers from the French army, including a major, five captains, and ten lieutenants. Commander Frederick Noel had been appointed to command "Weazel" in July, but Black was still in command at the time of these captures.
Between 18 and 31 October, a British squadron, consisting of , , , , , and "Weazel" joined a force of 1500 Austrians to besiege Trieste. The siege was successful, with the Allied force capturing the town and its 80 guns. The operation cost "Weazle" two men killed and four wounded.
In November, , which had been attached to Freemantle's squadron, was detached to take the port of Zara with the assistance of "Weazle". Captain George Cadogan of "Havannah" used the ships' guns to establish batteries armed with two 32-pounder carronades, eight 18-pounder guns and seven long 12-pounder guns. He then attacked the city and captured it with the aid of some Austrian troops. In all, they captured 110 guns and 18 howitzers, 350 men, 100 dismounted guns and 12 gunboats. Cadogan was later instructed to hand over all prizes and spoils of war to the Austrians. (This order cost the crews of "Havannah" and "Weazle" an estimated ₤300,000 in prize money.) The Emperor of Austria, however, awarded Lieutenant Hamley the Imperial Austrian Order of Leopold for his services at Zara.
On 9 December "Havannah" and "Weazel" destroyed 17 gunboats.
On 25 May 1814, captured the French naval xebec "Aigle" and her prize, the "Glorioso", off Corfu. "Weazel" shared in the prize money though it was the boats from "Elizabeth" that actually captured the French vessels in an action that in 1847 earned for their crews the Naval General Service Medal with clasp, "24 May Boat Service 1814". At the end of the campaign in early 1814, "Weazel" returned to Britain.
Fate.
"Weazel" was offered for sale at Portsmouth on 9 February 1815. She was sold for breaking up on 23 November 1815.

Gewerkschaftsbund

Zentralgewerkschaftskommission des Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes in der Tschechoslowakischen Republik ('Central Commission of German Trade Unions in the Czechoslovak Republic') was a German Social Democratic trade union centre in Czechoslovakia. From 1927 onwards, it was an autonomous structure inside the Czechoslovak labour centre OSČ. The organization was dissolved as Czechoslovakia fell under German occupation.
Early period.
The organization was founded in July 1919. In 1920 the name "Gewerkschaftsbund" was adopted, and a headquarter was set up in Liberec. "Gewerkschaftsbund" emerged as a prominent force in the amongst labour movements in Czechoslovakia, having around 75% of unionized German workers as its members in 1921 (at the time Czechoslovakia had a general unionizing rate of 50%, one of the higher in Europe). Major unions affiliated to "Gewerkschaftsbund" were Textile Workers (90,878 members in 1921), Metalworkers (39,209 members in 1921) and Miners (37,582 members in 1921).
In 1922, Czechoslovak communists had formed a separate trade union centre, "Mezinárodní všeodborový svaz" (MVS). However, not all communist trade unionists joined MVS. As of 1926, there were around 15 000 communists inside the "Gewerkschaftsbund" affiliates.
Merger into OSČ.
In 1927 "Gewerkschaftsbund" merged into the main Czechoslovak trade union centre, the Social Democratic "Odborové sdružení československé" (OSČ). The organization continued to function as an autonomous body inside OSČ until the unions were banned following the German occupation.
Leadership.
Franz Macoun was the general secretary of the organization from 1920 to 1938. Macoun had a Member of Parliament for the German Social Democratic Workers Party between 1929 and 1938.
Publications.
The organization issued the publication "Gewerkschafts-Jugend" ('Trade Union Youth') between 1934-1937.

Joe Wolfe Field is a baseball field in North Adams, Massachusetts, USA. The field is home to the North Adams SteepleCats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, a collegiate summer baseball league based in New England. The park was built in 1986, with the SteepleCats first utilizing the facility at their inception in the 2002 NECBL season. It has a seated capacity of 1,800 spectators, with additional seating and standing areas located down either foul line. The dimensions of the field are 325 ft. down the lines, 358 ft. in the gaps, and 385 ft. in dead center field. The park faces south in the Noel Field Athletic Complex. The field is lighted for night play with 8 light poles.
In 2012, the Division III MCLA Trailblazers baseball team of the nearby Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts played three home games at Joe Wolfe Field. The facility is also used by the baseball teams of Drury High School and Charles H. McCann Technical High School, both located in North Adams. Joe Wolfe Field also hosts other youth sports leagues.
History.
Joe Wolfe Field was built in 1986 on the site of Noel Field. Noel had served as North Adams' main baseball venue for decades, but its grandstand and playing surface had become outdated. In building Joe Wolfe, a new grandstand and lighting structures were added, and the field itself was renovated.
Then-mayor of North Adams John Barrett III and local sports figure Joe Wolfe were key to fundraising for and building the park. When Wolfe died in November 1986, shortly after the field's construction, Barrett and others involved in the development decided to name the field after Joe Wolfe. In addition to his involvement in the field's construction, Wolfe played semi-professional baseball, coached youth teams, and worked in local sports organizations.
In 2005, the field was renovated. An electronic scoreboard and concession stand were added, and the backstop was improved.
6,714 fans attended a July 4, 2006, game against the Holyoke Giants, won by Holyoke 3–2. The attendance mark is an NECBL record for regular season, postseason, and All-Star games.
The field hosted the 2007 NECBL All-Star Game. The visiting South Division All-Stars won the game, which was attended by 4,210 fans.

Battle of the Sinai (1973)

The Battle of the Sinai was one of the most consequential battles of the Yom Kippur war. An Egyptian attacking force that advanced beyond their line of defense at the Bar-Lev Line was repulsed with heavy losses by Israeli forces. This prompted the Israelis to launch Operation Abiray-Lev (Stouthearted Men) the next day, penetrating the Egyptian line of defense and crossing the Suez Canal. 
Background.
After Egyptian infantry had successfully crossed the canal and captured the Bar-Lev Line on October 6, Israeli forces made several counterattacks in attempts to push the Egyptians back across the Suez Canal. The Israelis suffered heavy losses in these attacks, and by October 9 Egyptian forces in the Sinai had managed to destroy 500 Israeli tanks. Following this both sides dug in. The Egyptians would not attack for fear of losing the cover of their SAM defences.
In the Golan Heights, Israel had repelled Syrian forces and had pushed into Syria itself. By the time Syrian forces had managed to put a halt to the Israeli advance, Israeli forces were 40 km from Damascus. Syrian president Hafez Al-Assad requested his Egyptian ally, Anwar El-Sadat for an attack in the Sinai, which would draw Israeli attention away from the Syrian front. Sadat consented and ordered the attack. His War Minister, Ahmed Ismail, and his Chief of Staff, Saad El Shazly, opposed the idea of an attack; Shazli in particular stated that for Egyptian forces to advance outside their SAM defences would mean their exposure to the Israeli Air Force, which the Egyptian Air Force was too weak to challenge. Sadat insisted that the attack proceed however, and both Ahmed Ismail and Shazli had no choice but to acknowledge the order.
Prelude.
The attack was to proceed on October 13, but was postponed to October 14. Four armored brigades and one mechanized infantry brigade under the command of the Second and Third Armies were to make four independent thrusts. Awaiting for them was a dug-in force of 800 Israeli tanks supported by infantry equipped with SS.11 missiles, as well as American-made LAW and TOW anti-tank missiles. Israel had in the Sinai by October 14 around fifteen brigades totaling nearly 60,000 infantry. The Israeli air force provided intense air cover during the battle.
Battle and aftermath.
The Egyptians launched their offensive early morning on October 14, at 6:30. The mechanized infantry brigade was to attack in the direction of the Gidi Pass, one armored brigade was to attack in the direction of the Mitla Pass, one brigade to attack towards Baluza, and two brigades to attack in the direction of Tasa. As anticipated by many Egyptian officers, the attack was a failure. Encountering stiff Israeli resistance, the Egyptian assault came to a halt after suffering heavy losses, and Egyptian troops retreated back to their lines on the Suez Canal.
Egyptian losses in the battle were 250 tanks and up to 1,000 men killed and wounded in action. By contrast, Israeli losses were 40 tanks. The following day, the Israelis launched Operation Abiray-Lev, crossing the Suez Canal and cutting of the Egyptian Third Army's supply lines.

Pyotr Sheremetev

Pyotr Borisovich Sheremetev () (1713–1788) was a Russian nobleman and courtier, the richest man in Russia aside from the tsar; he was the son of Boris Sheremetev.
When his father Boris died in 1719, tsar Peter promised to be "like a father" to Boris's children, and young Pyotr was brought up at court as a companion to the heir to the throne, who became tsar Peter II. 
After a teenage career in the Guards, Sheremetev became a chamberlain to the Empress Anna, and then to the Empress Elizabeth. Under Catherine the Great, he became a senator and was the first elected Marshal of the Nobility. Unlike other court favourites, who rose and fell with the change of sovereign, Sheremetev remained in office for six consecutive reigns. ... He was one of Russia's first noblemen to be independent in the European sense.
He was a lover of art and theater, using his vast wealth to remodel the Sheremetev Palace (known as the "Fountain House") on the Fontanka Embankment and the family estate at Kuskovo, where he collected a gallery of portraits, and to create a famous serf orchestra.
He married Varvara Alekseevna Cherkasskaya, daughter of an important court official, who brought him an expensive dowry. Their son was Nikolai Sheremetev.

Economic impact analysis

An economic impact analysis (EIA) examines the effect of an event on the economy in a specified area, ranging from a single neighborhood to the entire globe. It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs. The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization. An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.
An economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event "occurrs", and one assuming it "does not occurr" (which is referred to as the counterfactual case). This can be accomplished either before or after the event ("ex ante" or "ex post").
Overview.
An economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event. The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.
Types of Economic Impacts.
Economic impact analyses often estimate multiple types of impacts. An "output impact" is the total increase in business sales revenue. In turn, local businesses use some of this new revenue to pay for goods and services outside of the study region, so the output impact is not synonymous wasdasdith local business profits. A more conservative measure of economic activity is the "value added impact", which estimates the increase in the study region’s gross regional product. The gross regional product (GRP) is very similar to the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), and represents the total size of the local economy. This impact estimates the increase in local employee wages plus local business profits (not total revenue, like the output impact). However, the value added impact may overstate local profits when they are transferred overseas (such as in the form of dividends or investments in foreign facilities).
An even more conservative measure is the "labor income impact", which represents the increase in total money paid to local employees in the form of salaries and wages. The increases in income may come in the form of raises and/or increased hours for existing employees, or new jobs for the unemployed. This is a measure of the economic impact on just personal incomes, not business revenues or profits. A similar measure is the "employment impact", which measures the increase in the number of total employees in the local region. Instead of measuring the economic impact in terms of money, this measure presents the impact on the number of jobs in the region.
Another measure of economic impact is the "property value impact", measuring the increase in total property values, and is a reflection of generated income and wealth, both personal and business.
Sources of Economic Impacts.
In addition to the types of impacts, economic impact analyses often estimate the sources of the impacts. Each impact can be decomposed into different components, depending on the effect that caused the impact. "Direct effects" are the results of the money initially spent in the study region by the business or organization being studied. This includes money spent to pay for salaries, supplies, raw materials, and operating expenses.
The direct effects from the initial spending creates additional activity in the local economy. "Indirect effects" are the results of business-to-business transactions indirectly caused by the direct effects. Businesses initially benefiting from the direct effects will subsequently increase spending at other local businesses. The indirect effect is a measure of this increase in business-to-business activity (not including the initial round of spending, which is included in the direct effects).
"Induced effects" are the results of increased personal income caused by the direct and indirect effects. Businesses experiencing increased revenue from the direct and indirect effects will subsequently increase payroll expenditures (by hiring more employees, increasing payroll hours, raising salaries, etc.). Households will, in turn, increase spending at local businesses. The induced effect is a measure of this increase in household-to-business activity. Finally, "dynamic effects" are caused by geographic shifts over time in populations and businesses.
Methodology.
Economic impact analyses usually employ one of two methods for determining impacts. The first is an an input-output model (I/O model) for analyzing the regional economy. These models rely on inter-industry data to determine how effects in one industry will impact other sectors. In addition, I/O models also estimate the share of each industry's purchases that are supplied by local firms (versus those outside the study area). Based on this data, multipliers are calculated and used to estimate economic impacts. Examples of I/O models used for economic impact analyses are IMPLAN, RIMS-II, and EMSI.
Another method used for economic impact analyses are economic simulation models. These are more complex econometric and general equilibrium models. They account for everything the I/O model does, plus they forecast the impacts caused by future economic and demographic changes. One such is example is the REMI Model.
Comparison to Other Analyses.
Economic impact analyses are related to but differ from other similar studies. An economic impact analysis only covers specific types of economic activity. Some social impacts that affect a region's quality of life, such as safety and pollution, may be analyzed as part of a social impact assessment, but not an economic impact analysis, even if the economic value of those factors could be quantified. An economic impact analysis may be performed as one part of a broader environmental impact assessment, which is often used to examine impacts of proposed development projects. An economic impact analysis may also be performed to help calculate the benefits as part of a cost-benefit analysis.
Applications.
Economic impact analyses are used frequently in transportation planning. Common tools for this application include the Transportation Economic Development Impact System (TREDIS) and TranSight. Several transportation agencies, including the Transportation Research Board and US Department of Transportation, publish guides, standards, and techniques for utilizing economic impact analyses in transportation planning projects.
Economic impact analyses are often used to examine the consequences of economic development projects and efforts, such as real estate development, business openings and closures, and site selection projects. The analyses can also help increase community support for these projects, as well as help obtain grants and tax incentives.
An economic impact analysis is commonly developed in conjunction with proposed legislation or regulatory changes, in order to fully understand the impact of government action on the economy. The United States Department of Energy economic impact model is one example of this type of application. Many times the economic impact analysis is developed by the party advocating for the legislative or regulatory change, to communicate the merits of the proposed action. It can be useful with lobbying, media relations, and community outreach efforts.

Abdullah Al-Roumi

Abdullah Al-Roumi is a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly from the first district. Born in 1949, Al-Roumi worked as a lawyer before being elected to the National Assembly in 1985. Al-Roumi is considered an independent, liberal-leaning member.
Pro Gun Control.
In February 2005, in the wake of a wave of Al-Qaeda violence, the parliament unanimously passed a law giving police wide powers to search for and seize illegal weapons. Al-Roumi was one of the main proponents of the bill, which makes it easier for police to obtain a warrant to search a private house for illegal weapons. The law also allows female inspectors to search women's quarters in private homes—quarters which are off limits to men according to Islamic rules.
The parliament passed a similar law in 1992 to deal with a jump in gun ownership after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Lawmakers refused to extend that law in 1994, arguing that possession of weapons was a right.
Allegations Against Oil Minister Sheik Ali Al Jarrah Al Sabah.
In June 2007, Al-Roumi, Adel Al-Saraawi, and Musallam Al-Barrak led impeachment proceedings against Oil Minister Sheik Ali Al Jarrah Al Sabah on charges of corruption.
During the impeachment proceedings, Al-Roumi also made the following public statement against Sheik Ali: "You have to submit your resignation today because what you said has humiliated the Kuwaiti people." Sheikh Ali had been quoted by the local Al Qabas newspaper as saying that he considers former oil minister Sheikh Ali Khalifa Al Sabah, a defendant in a major graft case, as "my master and that I consult him occasionally on oil issues." 
Campaign to Reform Foreign Worker Sponsorship System.
In August 2008, Al-Roumi declared that he was going to draft a law to scrap Kuwait's foreign worker sponsorship system, under which expatriates must be sponsored by a local employer to get a work permit: "The government should be the only kafeel... We have scores of bachelors residing in Kuwait with an equal number of crimes. Many are caused due to the 'trading with humans' issue which taints the reputation of Kuwait." 
Denmark Boycott.
In February 2008, Al-Roumi called for the Kuwaiti government to boycott Denmark in response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and was quoted as saying, "No Muslim can accept this insult against the Prophet... It is a form of terrorism." 
Support For Female Candidates.
Al-Roumi currently supports women's active participation in the legislature. On May 10, 2008, he spoke at the inauguration of a women's campaign headquarters in the Salwa area. However, on November 30, 1999, Al-Roumi voted against granting women the right to vote.
Runner-Up in Speaker Election.
On June 1, 2008, Jassem Al-Kharafi was re-elected National Assembly Speaker on Sunday, after gaining 52 votes against 11 to his opponent, Abdullah Al-Roumi.
Supports Government Funds for College Tuition.
In 2002 Kuwait started allowing private universities in the country, beginning with the Gulf University for Science and Technology.
Reforming Mandatory Retirement Age for Teachers.
On November 28, 2008, Al-Roumi joined MPs Khalid Al-Sultan, Hassan Johar, Musallam Al-Barrak, and Marzouq Al-Hubaini in formulating a bill to extend the mandatory retirement age for Kuwaiti teaching staff at Kuwait University from 65 to 70 years. Al-Roumi argued that Item 32 of Law no. 15/1979 has denied the country services of able and intelligent academicians by restricting retirement age of Kuwaitis to 65 years. He recommended that a clause be added to the law such that the retirement age can become 70 years and can further be extended to 75 years.

Christmas Howard Davies (25 December 1916 - 5 November 1987) was a Welsh international rugby union full-back who played club rugby for Llanelli and Swansea. He won six caps for Wales.
Rugby career.
Davies was one of very few Welsh players to represent his country on either side of the Second World War. When he was first selected to play for Wales, he was playing club rugby for Swansea, having started his rugby career with Burry Port. His first international game was against Scotland as part of the 1939 Home Nations Championship under the captaincy of Wilf Wooller. Wales beat Scotland 11-3, and Davies was reselected for the very next match at Ravenhill Stadium in Belfast against Ireland. Wales were victorious, but with the outbreak of World War II, this was the last match either team would play for eight years.
When international rugby was re-introduced, Davies, now playing for Llanelli, was one of only two capped players to be chosen for the first Welsh match in the 1947 Five Nations Championship against England; the other being captain Haydn Tanner. The England game would be the only Wales match that Davies appeared on the losing side, as the final three games of the tournament Wales and Davies were victorious.

Relation between Schrödinger's equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics

This article relates the Schrödinger equation with the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics using a simple nonrelativistic one-dimensional single-particle Hamiltonian composed of kinetic and potential energy.
Background.
Schrödinger's equation.
Schrödinger's equation, in bra–ket notation, is
where formula_2 is the Hamiltonian operator. We have assumed for simplicity that there is only one spatial dimension.
The Hamiltonian operator can be written
where formula_4 is the potential energy, m is the mass and we have assumed for simplicity that there is only one spatial dimension q.
The formal solution of the equation is
where we have assumed the initial state is a free-particle spatial state formula_6.
The transition probability amplitude for a transition from an initial state formula_7 to a final free-particle spatial state formula_8 at time T is
Path integral formulation.
The path integral formulation states that the transition amplitude is simply the integral of the quantity
over all possible paths from the initial state to the final state. Here S is the classical action.
The reformulation of this transition amplitude, originally due to Dirac and conceptualized by Feynman, forms the basis of the path integral formulation.
From Schrödinger's equation to the path integral formulation.
Note: the following derivation is heuristic (it is valid in cases in which the potential, formula_11, commutes with the momentum, formula_12). Following Feynman, this derivation can be made rigorous by writing the momentum, formula_12, as the product of mass, formula_14, and a difference in position at two points, formula_15 and formula_16, separated by a time difference, formula_17, thus quantizing distance.
Note 2: There are two errata on page 11 in Zee, both of which are corrected here.
We can divide the time interval from 0 to T into N segments of length
The transition amplitude can then be written
We can insert the identity
matrix N-1 times between the exponentials to yield
Each individual transition probability can be written
We can insert the identity
into the amplitude to yield
where we have used the fact that the free particle wave function is
The integral over p can be performed (see Common integrals in quantum field theory) to obtain
The transition amplitude for the entire time period is
If we take the limit of large N the transition amplitude reduces to
where S is the classical action given by
and L is the classical Lagrangian given by
Any possible path of the particle, going from the initial state to the final state, is approximated as a broken line and included in the measure of the integral
This expression actually defines the manner in which the path integrals are to be taken. The coefficient in front is needed to ensure that the expression has the correct dimensions, but it has no actual relevance in any physical application.
This recovers the path integral formulation from Schrödinger's equation.

Sir Edward Bates, 1st Baronet

Sir Edward Bates, 1st Baronet (17 March 1816 – 17 October 1896) was a ship-owner and Conservative politician who represented Plymouth.
Bates was the son of Joseph Bates, a wool finisher and exporter and his wife Rebekah Walker. He was sent to Calcutta in 1833 to join his elder brother in the business which his father had started since the ending of the East India Company monopoly. He made two short trips to England in 1838-39 and in 1843, but otherwise remained in India at Calcutta and Bombay until 1848. Back in England, Bates began his own business chartering ships for the Bombay trade. He then started to own his own ships, acquiring the newly built Jamsetjee Cursetjee, named after his Parsee partner in Bombay. He had built a fleet of 60 ships in 1860 and eventually owned 130 ships.
Bates became Conservative Member of Parliament for Plymouth in 1871 and held the seat until 1880. He regained the seat in 1885, holding it until 1892. He was Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire and Lancashire, an J.P. for Lancashire. He was created 1st Baronet Bates, of Bellefield, co. Lancaster on 13 May 1880. He lived at Bellefield, West Derby, Liverpool, Lancashire, Manydown Park, Hampshire, and Gyrn Castle, Llanasa, Flintshire, Wales.
Bates first wife was Charlotte Elizabeth Umfreville-Smith, daughter of Cornelius Umfreville-Smith, whom he married in 1837. He married, secondly, Ellen Thompson, daughter of Thomas Thompson, on 25 June 1844. He had three daughters by his first wife.

Undercover were a dance music group from the UK, who had two Top 10 hits in 1992. The vocals on all the group's songs were sung by John Matthews, The band were formed in 1991, and are still active today.
Overview.
The first single they released was a cover version of Gerry Rafferty's 1978 UK/U.S. hit "Baker Street". It became their biggest hit when it reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart in September 1992, held off from the top only by another dance track "Rhythm is a Dancer" by Snap. It was the 11th biggest selling single of 1992 in the UK, and also attained major chart success across Europe, selling over a quarter of a million units in Germany alone.
Undercover released five more chart singles. The second single was a cover of Andrew Gold's "Never Let Her Slip Away", coincidentally also originally from 1978. It reached #5, and stayed in the UK chart for a total of 11 weeks. After the success of these two singles, an album, "Check Out the Groove", was released, reaching #26 in the UK Albums Chart. "I Wanna Stay With You" (a cover of the Gallagher and Lyle song) and "Lovesick", both from 1993, managed #28 and #62, respectively. In 1994, Undercover released a new single, "Best Friend", and their second album, "Ain't No Stopping Us".

Yoshio Kondo

Yoshio Kondo (1910, on Maui, Hawaii - 1990, on Oahu, Hawaii) was a biologist and malacologist. He spent virtually his entire life in Hawaii, with the exception of a number of collecting expeditions, primarily to islands in the Pacific Ocean (including the Mangarevan Expedition in 1934), and his time spent at Harvard University, where he received a Ph.D. under the direction of William J. Clench in 1955. He was known to most people as "Yoshi".
Kondo spent his entire professional career, over 40 years, at the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu. During most of that period, his official position was "Curator of Mollusks". His main research interests involved land snails in the families Achatinellidae and Partulidae, groups for which he was a major authority, although he did work with other mollusks as well.
He was succeeded by his son, Charles Kondo, PHD., and grandchildren: Douglas Kondo, Erica Kondo, and Nick Kondo.

Adnan Zahid Abdulsamad is a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, representing the first district. Born in 1950, Abdulsamad studied political science and worked in the Oil Ministry before being elected to the National Assembly in 1981. While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Abdulsamad affiliates with the National Islamic Alliance, which is a Shia party.
Supported Severing Ties with Denmark.
On November 6, 2006, the parliament voted 22-15 to approve severing diplomatic ties with Denmark over the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and spending about US$50 (€39.20) million to defend the prophet's image in the West. Both votes were nonbinding, meaning the Cabinet does not have to abide by them. Abdulsamad voted in favor of cutting diplomatic ties, saying, ""We have to cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Denmark...We don't have to eat Danish cheese."
Shiite Mini-series Controversy.
On September 16, 2007, Abdulsamad and fellow Shia MP Saleh Ashour spoke out against a planned Ramadan soap opera miniseries titled ‘’Sins Have a Price’’ which was to revolve around and criticize the Shiite form of temporary marriage known as "Mutaa.” In a public statement, Abdulsamad accused the series of giving "a total distortion of Shiism ... It also incites sectarianism... It is very provocative and comes at a sensitive time amid the sectarian tension in the region."
Abdulsamad charged that besides stoking sectarianism, the serial insults and distorts the Shia faith by mocking temporary marriage, a valid, sanctioned concept in Shiism despite the controversy and social taboos surrounding the practice.
Expulsion from Popular Action Bloc.
On February 19, 2008, the Popular Action Bloc expelled Abdulsamad and fellow Shiite MP Ahmed Lari for taking part in a ceremony eulogizing Hezbollah's slain top commander, Imad Mughniyeh. The ceremony's description of the fugitive Lebanese militant — killed in a February 12 car bombing in Syria — as a hero sparked public outrage in a country that holds him responsible for hijacking a Kuwait Airways flight and killing two of its Kuwaiti passengers 20 years ago. The two lawmakers were only expelled from their bloc and remained in the legislature. After the expulsions of the two, the seven member bloc was down to five members.

West Mountain (Utah)

West Mountain is a mountain located southwest of Provo, Utah and west of Benjamin, Utah. It is home to a radio station tower for KTCE, an FM station licensed to Payson, Utah and operating on 92.1 MHz. The mountain is also home to various FM radio translators and an observatory used by students from Brigham Young University. It can be accessed from a main road that starts near Benjamin, Utah. A small census designated place east of the mountain is known as West Mountain as well.
Geology.
West Mountain's highest point is at . The mountain is on the southern segment of the Wasatch Range, though it is not connected to the main range. The mountain is located on the southern shore of Utah Lake.
Radio uses.
The following are translators and radio stations located on the mountain (in order of frequency):
As well as radio stations, the mountain houses several cellular telephone transmitters providing service for AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile. The mountain also contains towers for local emergency services, and state and federal government services. An older tower, once operated by AT&T, is known more commonly as a "Long Line" tower, and was used for microwave communications is located on the summit. It is the tallest tower on the mountain, and is the most predominant feature. With the invention of fiber optics, the use of these towers gradually declined, and other similar towers have fallen into disrepair. This particular "long lines" tower, is connected to other towers in Riverton, Utah and Levan, Utah. A ham radio repeater, known as WA7FFM is located on the mountain as well.
Observatory.
West Mountain Observatory, which is operated by nearby Brigham Young University (BYU), is located just southwest of the summit of West Mountain. It was constructed for the astronomy department of BYU in 1981 and houses three telescopes. 
Access.
West Mountain road, which leads to the summit, begins on Lincoln Beach road, directly northeast of the summit. It is a winding road, which may or may not be in good condition, depending on the season. Those wishing to access the mountain are suggested to use four wheel drive vehicles.

Common integrals in quantum field theory

There are common integrals in quantum field theory that appear repeatedly. These integrals are all variations and generalizations of gaussian integrals to the complex plane and to multiple dimensions. Other integrals can be approximated by versions of the gaussian integral. Fourier integrals are also considered.
Variations on a simple gaussian integral.
Gaussian integral.
The first integral, with broad application outside of quantum field theory, is the gaussian integral.
In physics the factor of 1/2 in the argument of the exponential is common.
Note:
Thus we obtain
Slight generalization of the gaussian integral.
where we have scaled 
Integrals of exponents and even powers of "x".
and
In general
Note that the integrals of exponents and odd powers of x are 0, due to odd symmetry.
Integrals with a linear term in the argument of the exponent.
This integral can be performed by completing the square.
Integrals with an imaginary linear term in the argument of the exponent.
The integral
is proportional to the Fourier transform of the gaussian where formula_13 is the conjugate variable of formula_14.
By again completing the square we see that the Fourier transform of a gaussian is also a gaussian, but in the conjugate variable. The larger formula_15 is, the narrower the gaussian in formula_14 and the wider the gaussian in formula_13. This is a demonstration of the uncertainty principle.
Integrals with a complex argument of the exponent.
The integral of interest is (for an example of an application see Relation between Schrödinger's equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics)
We now assume that formula_19 and formula_20 may be complex. 
Completing the square
By analogy with the previous integrals
This result is valid as an integration in the complex plane as long as formula_19 has a positive imaginary part.
Gaussian integrals in higher dimensions.
The one-dimensional integrals can be generalized to multiple dimensions.
Here formula_25 is a real symmetric matrix.
This integral is performed by diagonalization of formula_25 with an orthogonal transformation
where formula_28 is a diagonal matrix and formula_29 is an orthogonal matrix. This decouples the variables and allows the integration to be performed as formula_30 one-dimensional integrations.
This is best illustrated with a two-dimensional example.
Example: Simple gaussian integration in two dimensions.
The gaussian integral in two dimensions is
where formula_32 is a two-dimensional symmetric matrix with components specified as
and we have used the Einstein summation convention.
Diagonalize the matrix.
The first step is to diagonalize the matrix. Note that
where, since A is a real symmetric matrix, we can choose formula_29 to be an orthogonal matrix, and hence also a unitary matrix.
We choose formula_29 such that
is diagonal.
formula_29 can be obtained from the eigenvectors of formula_25.
Eigenvalues of "A".
To find the eigenvectors of formula_25 one first finds the eigenvalues formula_41 of formula_25 given by
The eigenvalues are solutions of the characteristic polynomial
which are
Eigenvectors of "A".
Substitution of the eigenvalues back into the eigenvector equation yields
or 
From the characteristic equation we know
Also note
The eigenvectors can be written
and
for the two eigenvectors. Here formula_52 is a normalizing factor given by
It is easily verified that the two eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other.
Construction of the orthogonal matrix.
The orthogonal matrix is constructed by assigning the normalized eigenvectors as columns in the orthogonal matrix
Note that the determinant of O is equal to one.
If we define
then the orthogonal matrix can be written
which is simply a rotation of the eigenvectors.
The inverse is
Diagonal matrix.
The diagonal matrix becomes

The eigenvalues are

The orthogonal vector is
It is easily verified that the determinant of O is 1.
The inverse of O is

Rescale the variables and integrate.
With the diagonalization the integral can be written
where
Since the coordinate transformation is simply a rotation of coordinates the Jacobian determinant of the transformation is one yielding
The integrations can now be performed.
which is the advertised solution.
Integrals with complex and linear terms in multiple dimensions.
With the two-dimensional example it is now easy to see the generalization to the complex plane and to multiple dimensions.
Integrals with differential operators in the argument.
As an example consider the integral
where formula_79 is a differential operator with formula_80 and formula_81 functions of spacetime, and formula_82 indicates integration over all possible paths. In analogy with the matrix version of this integral the solution is
where
and formula_85, called the propagator, is the inverse of formula_79, and formula_87 is the Dirac delta function.
Similar arguments yield
and
See Path-integral formulation of virtual-particle exchange for an application of this integral.
Integrals that can be approximated by the method of steepest descent.
In quantum field theory n-dimensional integrals of the form
appear often. Here formula_91 is the reduced Planck's constant and f is a function with a positive minimum at formula_92. These integrals can be approximated by the method of steepest descent.
For small values of Planck's constant, f can be expanded about its minimum
Here formula_94 is the n by n matrix of second derivatives evaluated at the minimum of the function.
If we neglect higher order terms this integral can be integrated explicitly.
Integrals that can be approximated by the method of stationary phase.
A common integral is a path integral of the form
where formula_97 is the classical action and the integral is over all possible paths that a particle may take. In the limit of small formula_98 the integral can be evaluated in the stationary phase approximation. In this approximation the integral is over the path in which the action is a minimum. Therefore, this approximation recovers the classical limit of mechanics.
Fourier integrals.

The Ruins of Undermountain is boxed set for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for the second edition of the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy role-playing game. The set, with product code TSR 1060, was published in 1991, and was written by Ed Greenwood, with box cover art by Brom.
Contents.
The set consists of a 128-page booklet titled "Campaign Guide to Undermountain", a 32-page booklet titled "Undermountain Adventures", 8 double-sided loose-leaf monster statistics pages, 8 double-sided heavy-stock "adventure aid" cards, and 4 color fold-out poster maps.
The Campaign Guide to Undermountain book uses the same Brom cover art as the box cover itself, with interior art by Karl Waller and cartography by Diesel, Steve Beck, and David Sutherland. This book contains detailed information on the dungeon Undermountain, including non-player characters (such as Halaster Blackcloak) that can be encountered within the dungeons or in the city above it, as well as spells and magic items that can be found. The book also keys the maps to what can be found in various locations, and contains expansion guidelines for creating future adventures and deeper parts of the dungeon.
The Undermountain Adventures booklet describes seven adventures designed to be used within Undermountain, but can be used in any dungeon. The booklet also contains a "Monster Guide" of statblocks and descriptions of monsters not otherwise featured in the boxed set, and a description of the city of Skullport. The booklet has a detached cover, with cover art by Jeff Easley, and maps of some of the encounters on the inside, with cartography by David Sutherland.
The monster sheets detail 11 monsters in the Monstrous Compendium style: elder orb beholder, death kiss beholder-kin, darktentacles, ibrandlin, scaladar, sharn, slithermorph, flying snakes (flying fang and deathfang), steel shadow, and watchghost.
The cards are adventure aids for the Dungeon Master, detailing traps, encounters, treasure, and sundries that can be placed in the midst of adventures.
The maps detail the first three levels of the ruins of Undermountain; level three takes up two of the maps.
Reception.
The adventure was ranked the 17th greatest adventure of all time by "Dungeon" magazine for the 30th anniversary of the "Dungeons & Dragons" game in 2004.

2001 Jos riots

The 2001 Jos riots were riots involving Christians and Muslims in Jos, Nigeria over the appointment of a Muslim politician, Alhaji Muktar Mohammed, as local coordinator of the federal poverty alleviation program. The clashes started on 7 September and lasted nearly two weeks, ending on 17 September. Over 1000 people were killed because of the conflicts. 
Many houses, mosques and churches were damaged, destroyed or burned to the ground. Torched cars were left along the streets after the clashes between Christians and Muslims. Property and even human beings were set on fire also. Three churches of the Church of Christ in Nigeria (COCIN) were burned. Three major hospitals suggested that their government increased casualty figures by hundreds.
The clashes started on 7 September 2001, when a Christian woman attempted to cross a barricaded street. It led to a conflict between her and a group of Muslims, church leaders said. The fight eventually spread to other parts of the city. Christians were spontaneously attacked by Muslims, according to church leaders. The clash ended on 17 September 2001, when Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, lamented the violence between the Muslims and Christians. Local sources see the introduction of military intervention and strictly enforced curfews as the major contributor to the end of the clashes. Because of the large number of people involved who were killed in the clashes, a mass burial had to be arranged as said by Mortuary attendants from Jos University Teaching Hospital and Plateau State Specialist Hospital.
After 10 days of manslaughter, the infamous ethno-religion riots of Jos, the capital of Plateau state in northern Nigeria, recorded to have taken approximately 1000 lives. This riot not only caused the death of countless lives, it also cause the destruction of various infrastructure. Occurring in the early 2000s, with Nigeria being a developing country, the main set of infrastructure that was affected were the kiosks, which were looted and burnt. The burning of churches and Christians also caused this riot to escalate to a level which no one ever expected it to. Similar to the Jasmine revolution that caused the Arab Spring of 2011, this riot was sparked by the oppression by a group of officials on a single person, in this case it was sparked by a Christian trying to cross a barricade set up by a few Muslims.
Although this riot was said to have stopped 10 days after, it was just minimised due to the president calling a state of emergency, this riots had outbreaks again in 2008 and in 2010 with each being worse than the previous one. However, 2001 being the first riot cause the displacement of approximately 220,000 civilians whom fled to neighbouring states and cities where there was peace.
This is recorded as the highest number of lives displaced due to the infamous Jos riots, which is because this was the first one and no one knew how to handle the situation as opposed to the latter riots where people were better prepared and safer. This religious conflicts are commonly found on Jos due to its geographical placement in Nigerian. Jos is found in the middle of the country which lies between the predominantly Muslim north and the predominantly Christian south. Jos was also known for its high employment rate and job opportunity which caused it to be a big attraction the immigrants all around Nigeria. 
These constants riots always have a backlash on the economy of the state, which is one of the various causes of the constant fall of the Nigerian economy. The burning of buildings and high crime rates tend to put a hold on the economy in the state because all offices and business get shut down for the period of the riots and also for the aftermath till the Government feels it is safe for people to leave their houses. Although this has occurred three times in the past 13 years, it has caused the displacement of 250,000 from a population of 3million, which has an effect on the economy.

Francis Paddock

Dr. Francis Paddock (1814–1889) was a frontier doctor who settled in Salem, Kenosha County, Wisconsin in 1838 and became an important member of the community, serving as a physician, a politician, a businessman, 
a farmer, and an overall leader of the town. Paddock Lake, a prominent feature of The Village of Paddock Lake in Salem, Wisconsin, was named after him.
Background.
Francis Paddock was born in Camillus, Onondaga County, New York on September 15, 1814. He was the eldest of six children and took his education seriously from an early age, starting to teach at age seventeen. He attended Fairfield Medical College with the goal of becoming a physician. Fairfield Medical College was the first medical school west of the Hudson River. He later received an appointment with Dr. Hamilton of Auburn, allowing him to pursue his medical endeavors. 
Move to Wisconsin.
In 1838, at the age of twenty-five and finished with his medical education, Paddock and his family, three generations of it, traveled west from New York in a covered wagon to what was then the Wisconsin Territory. On the way, he passed Chicago and described it as "a marsh with a few Indian huts scattered here and there." He and his family settled between two lakes now known as Paddock and Hooker Lakes in the town of Salem in Kenosha County, Wisconsin. The eldest member of the group, David Paddock, Francis's grandfather, was a Revolutionary War veteran and died shortly after the trip. He was called 'Blind David' because he was blinded from powder burn injuries he sustained during the war. Starting their new life, the Paddock family was able to purchase about of land from the government at $1.50 an acre and built a log cabin on the land. 
On August 19, 1841, he married Martha Cecilla Munson. They had fourteen children together, nine of whom survived to adulthood with five dying in childhood. Paddock was the first medical professional in the area. However, he was a man of multiple trades. Not only a physician, he was also a businessman and a farmer. He ended up becoming one of the wealthiest and most influential members of his community. In 1843, he acquired of land from the U.S. Land Patent Office. He became well known and respected for his expertise in treating fevers and also for his large cattle herd. 
The Paddock farm had between 1500 and 2000 sheep and at one time over 100 cows and perhaps as many horses. Paddock was an example of the typical country doctor, having to ride horseback for miles in all kinds of Wisconsin weather. He carried medicines in saddlebags and had howling wolves following him during the winter months.
Paddock would store his medicines on shelves in the pantry. Sometimes when his supplies got low, he would divide up what was left among patients. If someone needed a tooth pulled, he would do the job for 25 cents. One night he delivered a baby at a home that did not have a candle. He solved the problem by putting grease in a dish, placing a rag in it and lighting it.
Concerned with providing his children the best education possible, Paddock's land became the site of the Paddock school house, which was built in 1843. The building still stands as a house next to Brass Ball Fruit Stand in Salem, Wisconsin. When there was a lack of funds to pay a teacher, he often kept a teacher in the house for his own children, as well as the neighbor children, and paid the salary himself. He converted the front room of his home into a school room for this purpose.
Public office.
From 1842 to 1844, he was the supervisor of the town of Salem. He also served his town as the Commissioner of Schools and Justice of the Peace. In 1855, he served in the Wisconsin State Senate as a Republican member from the 8th district. 
Death.
Paddock died on March 29, 1889 in his home in Salem and was laid to rest in Salem Cemetery. 
In 1960, the hamlet known as Paddock Lake in the Town of Salem was approved to separate from Salem and The Village of Paddock Lake was created.

Mandy Brooks

Jonathan Joseph "Mandy" Brooks, (born Jonathan Joseph Brozek) (August 18, 1897 – December 6, 1976) was a right-handed outfielder in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs.
Brooks' major-league debut came at the relatively advanced age of 27 on May 30, 1925. He went on to be a regular for the Cubs that season, playing the second-most games of any outfielder. Every one of his defensive appearances came in center field. It was a rather successful rookie campaign; Brooks trailed only future Hall of Famer Gabby Hartnett for the club's home run lead by slugging 14 round-trippers, good enough to finish tenth in the entire National League in that category. Brooks was also second on the Cubs in RBI (72) and slugging percentage (.513). He finished his first season with a respectable .281 batting average.
Brooks, however, fell victim to the Cubs' acquisition of star outfielder Hack Wilson and found himself all but useless in the 1926 season. He played his final game for the Cubs on June 22 of that year, finishing his final big-league campaign with modest marks of 1 home run, a .188 batting average, and 6 RBI.
Brooks died on December 6, 1976 in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin.

Euzaphlegidae

Euzaphlegidae is a family of extinct, snake mackerel-like, or escolar-like fish whose fossils are found from Late Miocene strata of Southern California.
Description and Taxonomy.
In life, the Euzaphlegidae would have born a superficial resemblance to mackerels or wahoo, leading some researchers to place them within Scombridae or Cybiidae, respectively. However, x-ray analysis of the bone structure strongly suggests a relationship with the snake-mackerels, with some experts placing them within Gempylidae.
Ecology and Evolution.
The sharp teeth and mackerel-like forms strongly suggest that the euzaphlegids were predators, verified by the remains of numerous extinct deep sea smelt, "Bathylagus", and herring, "Xyne grex", found within the stomachs of several specimens of "Thyrsocles" and "Euzaphleges". Researcher Lore Rose David proposed that, because the Euzaphlegidae were comparatively less adapted to a pelagic lifestyle like the gempylids, but had slender skeletons suggesting of a deep-water lifestyle, the Euzaphlegidae lived in deep, offshore communities near the ocean floor, where they preyed on other fish. David also suggested that the Euzaphlegidae presence in Miocene California excluded the gempylids from establishing themselves there at the time, while the presence of scombrids in shallower water ecosystems prevented the Euzaphlegidae from establishing themselves in shallow water.
During the time of the Late Miocene, Southern California had a very warm, tropical climate. The transition from Late Miocene to Early Pliocene saw the climate cool, and this cooling event drove the Euzaphlegidae and several other (locally) endemic fish species, such as the manefish "Chalcidichthys" and the spinyfin "Absalomichthys", into extinction. This cooling event, coupled with the survival of the scombrids in southern Californian marine ecosystems, also helped prevent gempylids from replacing the Euzaphlegidae during the Pliocene or Pleistocene.

57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron

The 57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, also known as "The Black Knights of Keflavik", is an inactive United States Air Force unit. The 57 FIS was last stationed at Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland. It was inactivated on 1 March 1995.
History.
World War II.
The squadron was activated at Hamilton Field, California as the 57th Pursuit Squadron on 15 January 1941, as one of the three original squadrons of the 54th Pursuit Group. It trained with Curtiss P-36 Hawks and Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, then moved to Everett Army Air Field, where it served as a part of the air defense force for the Pacific coast during the first few months of World War II. It was formed with a cadre from the 35th Pursuit Group. The squadron was redesignated as a fighter unit in May 1942.
On 20 June 1942, the air echelon of the 56th took its P-40s and newly assigned Bell P-39 Airacobras to Elmendorf Field, Alaska, where it served in combat against the Japanese forces that invaded the Aleutian Islands during the summer of 1942. The unit did not in itself take any part in the action against the Japanese in the Aleutians, but a detachment of eleven of the pilots saw service with the 42d which was based at Kodiak NAS, Adak and between them got three confirmed victories and two probables. On 4 August 1942, the 57th was moved to Kodiak NAS, Adak and there replaced the 42d. All its pilots were rotated to Adak to gain combat experience.
The air echelon returned to the United States in December 1942 and rejoined the group, which had been assigned to Third Air Force in Louisiana, and became a replacement training unit (RTU) for North American P-51 Mustang pilots. RTUs were oversized units training individual pilots or aircrews. The unit's P-39s were to be flown to Duncan Field, Texas for depot-level overhaul. It was reequipped with the North American P-51A Mustang, thereby becoming the first P-51 unit in the AAF.
In early May 1943, the 54th Fighter Group began a split operation, with headquarters and the 56th and 57th Fighter Squadrons relocating to Bartow Army Air Field, Florida, while the group's other squadron was at Hillsborough Army Air Field. However, the Army Air Forces (AAF) was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit. As a result, in 1944 the squadron was disbanded as the AAF converted to the AAF Base Unit system. The units at Bartow were replaced by the 340th AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter),
Reserve Operations.
The unit was reactivated under Air Defense Command (ADC) on 24 March 1947 as an Air Force Reserve fighter squadron at Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona. The unit was not fully manned or equipped. It was inactivated in June 1949 when Continental Air Command reorganized its reserve units under the Wing Base Organization system.
Air Defense Command.
In March 1953, the squadron was reactivated as the 57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, flying Northrop F-89 Scorpions was activated at Presque Isle Air Force Base,Maine as the 528th Air Defense Group's second operational squadron. A second swap of units began when the 82d Fighter Interceptor Squadron arrived from Iceland. The 57th FIS then moved to Iceland and was reassigned away from the group in November of the same year. 
The 57th was reactivated as a regulat squadron at Presque Isle AFB, Maine, on 20 March 1953 under Air Defense Command and designated the 57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. It was equipped with Northrop F-89C Scorpion interceptor, and assigned to the 528th Air Defense Group. It maintained a 24 hour alert at Presque Isle.
Air Defense of Iceland.
On 12 November 1954, the 57th FIS moved to Keflavik Airport, Iceland, replacing the 82d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron which was temporarily assigned from Larson AFB, Washington. At Keflavik, the squadron was assigned to Iceland Air Defense Force (IADF), a component of Military Air Transport Service.
The 57th FIS at Keflavik was an interceptor squadron charged with the monitoring of the Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom gap in the North Atlantic that formed a naval warfare choke point during the Cold War. The 57th would respond alerts from Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning stations established on Iceland; the GCI stations guiding its interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the radar scopes. Over 1,000 intercepts of Soviet aircraft took place inside Iceland's Military Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).
On 18 December 1955 MATS activated the 1400th Operations Group as the mission at Keflavik was expanded to accommodate Tactical Air Command (TAC) and Strategic Air Command transient aircraft. In 1959, a retrenchment of USAF operations began, including the reduction of F-89 interceptors and ADC and SAC (tenant) activities.
Air Force activities at the airport were reorganized and IADF was redesignated Air Forces Iceland, which functioned at a Wing level on 1 July 1960. Shortly afterwards, the USAF transferred jurisdiction of Keflavik Airport to the United States Navy on 1 July 1961 which named it Naval Air Station Keflavik. The Air Force units at Keflavik operated in a tenant status with the 57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and two Aircraft Control and Warning Squadrons on 1 July 1961. The USAF facilities remained designated Keflavik Airport.
In 1962 ADC replaced the squadron's F-89s with newer Convair F-102 Delta Dagger supersonic interceptors, the F-89s generally being worn-out after nearly a decade of continual interceptions. Challenges by the 57th FIS to Soviet aircraft on flights over the North Atlantic and along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States to bases in Cuba continued throughout the 1960s.
The first McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II aircraft was assigned to the squadron on 16 April 1973, as TAC was replacing its F-4C's with F-4E models at the end of the Vietnam War. By 30 June, the squadron. had six F-4Cs and additional F-4s were received in the third quarter of 1974. The last of the F-102s were replaced in early 1975 when additional F-4Cs were received from TAC squadrons at Luke AFB and George AFB; the last F-4C arriving in March 1976.
In early 1978 preparations for the exchange of the F-4C for F-4Es were underway with the first two aircraft landing on 21 March. These aircraft were better equipped than the C models, with solid state radios and tactical navigation equipment, lead computing optical gunsight and ILS. Twelve aircraft arrived between April and July, and the last F-4Cs left on 14 June.
Some F-106 Delta Darts were received by the 57th FIS by Aerospace Defense Command in 1977 from ADC units inactivating in the United States. because of increased activity around the Kola Peninsula in the USSR, but in all probability it was extra capacity added to assist while the 57th began converting to the F-4E. The Delta Darts did stand alert, but not in the Alert Hangar itself, but from the flight line beside it.
On 1 October 1979 TAC absorbed ADC's assets, and the F-4E Phantom II aircraft of the 57th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. In 1982 the construction of hardened aircraft shelters was planned on the west end of the airfield and this construction started in 1983. The shelters were of a Norwegian design, with the doors opening inwards and fitting into a recess in the foundation, thus making the floor for the aircraft to taxi over. Thirteen shelters were constructed.
In 1984 it was announced that the 57th FIS was programmed to receive the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. Initially, it was believed that the squadron would get the F-15A model, as that was the version going into the ANG units at that time, and the 57th had never been equipped with the most modern front-line aircraft in the USAF. It therefore came as a surprise that July 1985, that modern F-15Cs and F-15Ds replaced the aging F-4s, and the tail code "IS" was assigned to Air Forces Iceland (AFI).
On 1 June 1992, Air Combat Command (ACC) assumed command and control of AFI and the 57th FIS. Air Forces Iceland was inactivated on 31 May 1993. Activated in its place, assuming the mission previously carried out by AFI, was the 35th Wing that was transferred from the closing George Air Force Base, California. The change was part of the Air Force's "objective wing" plan. On 1 October 1993, an ACC realignment transferred administrative control of the 35th Fighter Wing from First Air Force to Eighth Air Force. However, the 35th would go through another major change less than two years after it was activated at Keflavik.
Because the 35th garnered the majority of its history in the Pacific theater during World War II, and in California since 1971 until its move to Iceland, it was decided to relocate the unit back to that area. Consequently, the 35th Fighter Wing was relieved of its assignment to ACC and transferred to Misawa Air Base, Japan, on 1 October 1994. To assume the mission at Keflavik, the 85th Wing was activated on the same day.
The 85th Wing was a combination of the lineages and histories of the 85th Fighter-Bomber Group and the former Air Forces Iceland. This allowed the Air Force contingent in Iceland to keep alive its distinguished history in the foreign nation, while also retaining the history of a World War II flying unit.
Air Force reductions and a new agreement with the Government of Iceland continued to affect Keflavik organizations. On 1 March 1995, the 57th FS was inactivated and the interceptor force was replaced by Regular Air Force and Air National Guard F-15 Eagle fighter aircraft rotating every 90 days to Iceland until the USAF inactivated the 85th Group in 2002.

Fouad Shehab Command and Staff College

The Fouad Shehab Command and Staff College (CSC) ( "Kouliyat Fouad Chehab lelkiyada' wal'arkan") is a Lebanese Armed Forces facility that functions as a graduate school for the Lebanese Army in addition to other Arab armies. It was originally established in 1974 as the "Center of Higher Military Education". The college is named after the former Lebanese Army commander-in-chief and former Lebanese president Fuad Chehab.
History.
The LAF CSC was founded on September 1, 1974 under the name "Center of Higher Military Education" and headquartered at the LAF headquarters in Yarze, it was later renamed on January 24, 1980 into "College of Higher Military Education", ultimately it was called "Command & Staff College" on August 18, 1983 and headquartered since then at the town of Rihania.
As of October 10, 2005, the name of General Fuad Chehab was added to the name of the college as way to honor him.
Mission.
The LAF CSC prepares officers of different arms to exercise command over tactical, logistic units or administration services. It also prepares officers to fulfill staff function at different levels. Moreover, it organizes training periods for acquisition of staff techniques. The CSC also increases the officers' ability to better fulfill their missions by deepening their knowledge through studies and researches. In addition, the college carries out researches, in favor of the army command, into some subjects of military strategy that might interest the national defense.
Courses.
The initial training is three years at the Military Academy, on the third year an application course takes place, for some officers this course is followed abroad. The higher courses are taken after the initial training, depending on the track of each individual:
Applications.
The college employs Janus tactical simulator in its courses, which was officially ready for use in 2006. The simulator is used
to train the major units' staff commanders and the officers enrolled for battalion commander and staff courses in the CSC, for fields skills and up to Brigade level command. This is done by making simulations on various changing tactical combat conditions, and experience them on assessing the combat situation under various realistic and pressuring conditions, while taking into account the practical application of the staff theories, techniques, and knowledge. In addition to conducting training on decision making and giving orders at the right time in the right place for the commanded units.
Emblem.
Each symbol on the emblem of the Command and Staff College represents a specific ideal for a member of the Army:

Black Widows of Liverpool

Catherine Flannagan (1829 – 3 March 1884) and Margaret Higgins (1843 – 3 March 1884) were Irish sisters who were convicted of poisoning and murdering one person in Liverpool and suspected of more deaths. The women collected a burial society payout, a type of life insurance, on each death, and it was eventually found that they had been committing murders using arsenic to obtain the insurance money. Though Catherine Flannagan evaded police for a time, both sisters were eventually caught and convicted of one of the murders; they were both hanged on the same day at Kirkdale Prison. Modern investigation of the crime has raised the possibility that Flannagan and Higgins were known or believed by investigators to be only part of a larger conspiracy of murder-for-profit—a network of "black widows"—but no convictions were ever obtained for any of the alleged conspiracy members other than the two sisters.
Deaths.
In the early 1880s, unmarried sisters Catherine and Margaret Flannagan ran a rooming house at 5 Skirving Street, Liverpool. The household in the final months of 1880 consisted of the two sisters, Catherine's son John, and two lodger families – hod carrier Thomas Higgins and his daughter Mary, and Patrick Jennings and his daughter Margaret. John Flannagan, 22 and previously healthy, died suddenly in December 1880. His death did not raise any particular comment; Catherine collected £71 (worth roughly £ in 2012 pounds) from the burial society with which he had been registered and he was interred shortly thereafter.
By 1882, a romance had sprung up between Margaret and lodger Thomas Higgins. The pair married in October of that year. Thomas's daughter Mary, 8, died within months of the wedding after a short illness. Once again, the burial society payout was collected upon death, this time by Margaret Higgins.
In January 1883, Margaret Jennings, 19, died. Her burial payout was collected by Catherine.
In the face of neighbourhood gossip about the death rate in the home, Catherine, Margaret, and Thomas moved their household to 105 Latimer Street and then again to 27 Ascot street. In September 1883, Thomas Higgins, then 45, became yet another member of the household to fall mysteriously ill. His stomach pains were severe enough that Doctor Whitford was called; the doctor attributed Higgins's illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap whiskey and prescribed opium and castor oil. Higgins died after two days of illness. Days later, the same doctor was contacted and asked to provide a death certificate. He did so, attributing the death to dysentery.
Investigation.
Though Thomas Higgins's death by apparent dysentery raised no questions for the attending doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick was surprised to hear that his brother, who had been strong and in good general health, could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around £100, he pursued the matter with the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home.
When a full autopsy of Higgins's body was carried out, evidence of arsenic poisoning was found: Higgins's organs showed traces of arsenic, in quantities indicating the poisoning had taken place over several days. Evidence from the home, including "a bottle containing a mystery white substance and a market pocket worn by " was examined by poison expert Dr Campbell Brown, who verified the presence of arsenic – dust in Margaret's pocket, and an arsenic solution (containing unusual adulterants) in the bottle.
Margaret Higgins was arrested immediately; Catherine, after moving from one boarding house to another to avoid police for nearly a week, was taken into custody in Wavertree. On 16 October 1883, the sisters were formally charged with the murder of Thomas Higgins.
Orders for the bodies of the previously-deceased members of the household to be exhumed were issued when it became clear that arsenic was the mechanism of Thomas Higgins's death. The bodies of John Flannagan, Mary Higgins, and Margaret Jennings all showed evidence of minimal deterioration – a quality associated with arsenic poisoning – and traces of arsenic were found in the remains of all three.
Investigators initially assumed that the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison failed to show up in autopsies, they were forced to come up with a new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.
Aftermath.
At the time of her arrest, Catherine claimed to her solicitor that the murders the sisters committed were not isolated, and provided a list of six or seven other deaths that she claimed to be murders related to burial society fraud, as well as a list of five other women who had either perpetrated those murders or provided insurance to those who did.
Alleged conspiracy.
Catherine Flannagan's list of alleged conspirators to the arsenic deaths contained three poisoners other than herself, one accomplice, and three agents of the insuring groups who had provided payouts upon the deaths. Margaret Evans, Bridget Begley, and Margaret Higgins were named as the poisoners; Margaret Potter, a Mrs Fallon, and a Bridget Stanton were the insurers; and Catherine Ryan was alleged to have obtained the arsenic needed by one of the poisoners. According to Flannagan, Margaret Evans had been the instigator of the crime ring, beginning with the murder of a mentally-handicapped teenager in which Ryan obtained the poison and Evans administered it. Though Evans did not personally receive an insurance payout from this death, there were implications that she had dealings with the boy's father and may have profited from those. The women Flannagan alleged to have been involved in the conspiracy all appear often in accounts of suspicious deaths in this period; Mrs Stanton, for example, was linked to the insurance policies of three of the deaths, and groups of two or more of the involved women were seen visiting those who died shortly before their deaths. In one case, when an insurance company supervisor requested to meet Thomas Higgins in the course of issuing the insurance on him, he was greeted at the Higgins home by a woman who was neither Flannagan nor Higgins, who presented to him a "Thomas" who he later realised, upon seeing the deceased Thomas Higgins, was not Thomas Higgins at all.
Flannagan's testimony was sometimes contradictory to both herself and to what seemed to be obvious facts of the conspiracy, however; in one case, despite Mrs Stanton's close links to the insurance payouts of murder victims and Flannagan's identification of her as part of the conspiracy, Flannagan "exonerated" Stanton after police arrested the woman. Ultimately it was decided by the Prosecuting Solicitor for Liverpool that while the additional deaths were, indeed, likely to be murder, it would be difficult to prove that anyone other than Higgins or Flannagan had committed them, especially considering that the primary evidence against the other women was being provided by Flannagan, who had every reason to attempt to minimise her own responsibility in such crimes. As a result, only Flannagan and Higgins were tried for the crime of murdering Thomas Higgins, despite continuing suspicion by all investigating parties that there had been more deaths than just the four household ones, and more murderers than just the two sisters.
Trial.
At the trial in 1884, prosecutors implicated the sisters in the three other deaths in their household, as well as that of Thomas Higgins, with which they were officially charged. Catherine Flannagan's offer to provide evidence against other conspirators for the prosecution in exchange for leniency was refused. The sisters were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. The sentence was carried out on 3 March 1884 at Kirkdale Prison, with the sisters attended to by a Roman Catholic priest. The deaths were witnessed by a reported one thousand people.
In media.
Contemporary accounts of the Flannagan sisters referred to them as "disciple of Lucrezia Borgia" or as "the Borgias of the Slums", in reference to their use of poison and the tales of how Borgia had been known to do the same. Modern accounts of the Flannagan sisters, such as those by Angela Brabin and the television series Deadly Women, have focused more on the cooperative aspect of the crimes rather than the poison aspect, and tend to refer to them as "black widows" or "The Black Widows of Liverpool", particularly in reference to the allegation that the Flannagan sisters were part of a larger murder ring. Wax effigies of Flannagan and Higgins were placed in Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors after their executions.

German post offices abroad

The German post offices abroad were a network of post offices in foreign countries established by Germany to provide mail service where the local services were deemed unsafe or unreliable. They were generally set up in cities with some sort of German commercial interest. In early use only the cancellation mark can identify their postal use aboad; such stamps are known as "Vorläufer" (forerunner) stamps. Later stamps are identified by overprints even when not postally used. German abroad stamps started appearing in the late 19th century and reached their heyday at the beginning of the 20th century; they closed down during or shortly after World War I.
It was not unusual for countries to maintain such offices and Austria-Hungary, China, France, Greece, Italy, Romania, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States all did so. In the latter part of 19th century and into the 20th century, having extraterritorial post offices was one indication of a nation's international power.
Stamps from German post offices abroad are popular with collectors and some are quite valuable. In a 2006 auction, a 40 Pfennig Germania hand-stamped "China" (Tientsin issue) stamp from 1900 realized 100,152 Euros.

Alpine Loop National Back Country Byway

The Alpine Loop National Back Country Byway is located northeast of Silverton, Colorado in San Juan and Hinsdale Counties. The route is circular, running from the ghost town of Animas Forks to Lake City and return. The Byway combines crossings of Engineer and Cinnamon Passes with high country scenery that features river meadows, alpine tundra, and ghost towns.
While the meadows and tundra are accessible to ordinary passenger vehicles, a high-clearance 4-wheel drive vehicle is required to travel the entire route.
Route description.
The Alpine Loop is generally considered to begin and end at Lake City. From there the route commonly followed is west over Cinnamon Pass to Animas Forks, and then returning east over Engineer Pass back to Lake City. This clockwise circuit generally puts the vehicle on the inside "lane" of the mountainous portions (but moot because almost all is single track) with the driver on the outside, providing a better view of the relative position of the vehicle and the outer edge of the road at the top of the drop-off.

Monticello Wine Company

The Monticello Wine Company was a Charlottesville, Virginia cooperative founded in 1873 by local grape growers, led by a German, Oscar Reierson. Its four-story winery had a capacity of 200,000 gallons, and was located at the end of Wine Street, near Hedge Street. It was the largest winery in the South. It shut down with the onset of Prohibition in Virginia, which took effect on November 1, 1916.
The success of Monticello Wine Company brought Charlottesville to declare itself "the Capital of the Wine Belt in Virginia." The company was best known for its Virginia Claret Wine, produced with Norton grapes—it "won a major international award in 1873 at the Vienna Exposition." It was located in what is now the Monticello American Viticultural Area.

Metompkin Island is a barrier island off the east coast of Virginia in the United States. It is located in Accomack County.
A proposed United States Navy seaplane tender, USS "Metomkin" (AVP-47), was to have been named for Metomkin Island, but the ship was cancelled in 1943 before construction could begin. However, a U.S. Navy cargo ship, USS "Metomkin" (AG-136), in commission from 1947 to 1951, did carry the island's name.

Ahmed Lari is a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, representing the first district. Born in 1955, Lari studied Statistics and worked in the Municipal Council before being elected to the National Assembly in 2006. While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Lari is a member of the National Islamic Alliance, a Shia party. 
Expulsion from Popular Action Bloc.
On February 19, 2008, the Popular Action Bloc expelled Lari and fellow Shiite MP Adnan Zahid Abdulsamad for taking part in a ceremony eulogizing Hezbollah's slain top commander, Imad Mughniyeh. The ceremony's description of the fugitive Lebanese militant — killed in a February 12 car bombing in Syria — as a hero sparked public outrage in a country that holds him responsible for hijacking a Kuwait Airways flight and killing two of its Kuwaiti passengers 20 years ago. The two lawmakers were only expelled from their bloc and remained in the legislature. After the expulsions of the two, the seven member bloc was down to five members.
Opposition to Grilling of Prime Minister Nasser.
In November 2008, Waleed Al-Tabtabaie, Mohammed AlـMutair, and Mohammed Hayef AlـMutairi filed a request to grill Prime Minister Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah for allowing prominent Iranian Shiite cleric Mohammad Baqir al-Fali to enter Kuwait despite a legal ban.

Joe Brown (utility player)

Joseph E. "Joe" Brown (April 4, 1859 – June 28, 1888 in Warren, Pennsylvania) was a pitcher/utility player in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Stockings and Baltimore Orioles.
It was relatively common in the 19th century for baseball teams to use a reserve fielder as a pitcher, and this appears to be true in Brown's case. He appeared in 15 games for the 1884 Cubs (debuting August 16), pitching in seven of those games, six as a starter. His mark that season was 4–2 with a 4.68 ERA. He also played center field, right field, first baseman, and catcher for the Cubs that season, hitting .213 with 3 RBI in 61 trips to the plate.
Brown found himself with the American Association's Orioles in the 1886 season in a similar role for a brief period of time. He pitched in four games, completing and losing each one for a record of 0–4 and an ERA of 5.68. He also appeared in one game as a second baseman. Brown was 3-for-19 at the plate in 1886 to finish his career with a batting average of exactly .200 (16-for-80). 
Brown died on June 28, 1888 in his birthplace of Warren, Pennsylvania, aged just 29.

Epistemic community (international relations)

An epistemic community in international relations (IR) is a network of professionals with recognized knowledge and skill in a particular issue-area. They share a set of beliefs, which provide a value-based foundation for the actions of members.
Members of an epistemic community also share causal beliefs, which result from their analysis of practices that contribute to set of problems in their issue-area that then allow them to see the multiple links between policy and outcomes. Third, they share notions of validity, or internationally defined criteria for validating knowledge in their area of know-how. However, the members are from all different professions. Epistemic communities also have a common set of practices associated with a set of problems towards which their professional knowledge is directed, because of the belief that human welfare will benefit as a result. Communities evolve independently and without influence of authority or government. They do not have to be large; some are made up of only a few members. Even non-members can have an influence on epistemic communities. However, if the community loses consensus, then its authority decreases.
Emergence.
Epistemic communities came to be because of the rapid professionalization of government agencies. The Columbia Basin Inter-Agency Committee was created by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to coordinate the planning process. However, it did not actually participate in the planning process, but rather, was the venue that the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation used to divide construction projects. The failure of the Columbia Basin Inter-Agency Committee to be part of the planning process shows that “committees imposed from the top may be less likely to promote coordination than to provide agency officials with a means to enhance their autonomy,” (Thomas 1997, 225). Another reason why epistemic communities came to be is that decision makers began turning to experts to help them understand issues because there were more issues and all were more complicated. This caused greater interest in planning, and future-oriented research, which caused the establishment of environmental and natural resource agencies in 118 countries from 1972-1982. Growing professionalization of bureaucracies caused more respect towards experts, especially scientists. The first achievement by epistemic communities was the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the United States and Russia.
Role in international relations.
Epistemic communities influence policy by providing knowledge to policy makers. Uncertainty plays a large role in an epistemic community's influence, because they hold the knowledge that policy makers need to create the wanted outcomes in policy. According to Robert Keohane they fill the absence of “a research program” shows in particular studies that it can illuminate important issues in world politics,” (Adler/Hass 1992, 367). They can influence the setting of standards and the development of regulations as well as help coordinate structure of IR. The communities influence through communicative action; diffusing ideas nationally, transnationally, and internationally. An epistemic community’s scope of cooperation is directly linked to the comprehensiveness of their beliefs. The strength of cooperative agreements depends on the power that the epistemic community has gathered within agencies and governments. The duration of cooperation is determined by the epistemic community’s continued power. The most important contributions of epistemic communities are; that they direct attention towards the conditions which will likely cause a coalition to form and the possibilities of expansion, they insists on the importance of awareness and knowledge in negotiation, and they deepen the knowledge of how various actors define their interests.
Role in international policy coordination.
Epistemic communities usually aid in issues concerning a technical nature. Normally, they guide decision makers towards the appropriate norms and institutions by framing and institutionalizing the issue-area.
Epistemic communities are also a source of policy innovation. Communities have indirect and direct roles in policy coordination by diffusing ideas and influencing the positions adopted. Policy evolution occurs in four steps: policy innovation, diffusion, selection, and persistence. Through framing the range of political controversy surrounding an issue, defining state interests, and setting standards epistemic communities can define the best solution to a problem. The definition of interest is specially important because there are many different definitions of what is a priority for a government. Intellectual innovations (produced by epistemic communities) are carried by domestic or international organizations (epistemic communities are a part of these organizations) then are selected by political process. Peter M. Haas argued “that epistemic communities help to explain the emergence and character of cooperation at the international level,” (Thomas 1997, 223). The shared interests they represent last more than the disagreements about a specific issue. Epistemic communities create a reality that is hindered by political factors and related considerations. If an epistemic community only acquires power in one country or international body, then its power is a direct effect of that country or body’s power.
Impact.
Epistemic communities became institutionalized in the short term because of change into the policy-making process and to persuade others that their approach is the right approach. Long term effects occur through socialization. There are a myriad of examples of the impact that epistemic communities have had on public policy. Arms control ideas are reflected in the ABM Treaty and agreements following it during Cold War. Epistemic communities brought attention to chlorofluorocarbons and their polluting consequences. This realization led to the creation of environmental international agencies in a majority of the world’s governments. This caused environmental decisions to go through the United Nations Environment Programme rather than though General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) who would normally dispute these issues. Such was the case when the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal.
An epistemic community helped identify issues and direct the parameters that provided outline for GATT and some free trade agreements. They have also helped in telecommunications agreements and economy issues around the world. In telecommunications, “without the influence of an epistemic community of engineers concerned about design and international coordination of telecommunications equipment and standards, the regime would not have moved in the direction of multilateral agreements,” (Adler/Haas 1992, 377). 
Epistemic communities were directly involved in the creation of the Board of Plant Genetic Resources. As well as the creation of food aid and the way that food aid functions. Epistemic communities also have brought attention to the habitat fragmentation and decline of biodiversity on the planet. This has led to reform throughout the world creating conservation agencies and policies. In California, an ecological epistemic community succeeded in creating the Memorandum of Understanding Biological Diversity (MOU on Biodiversity). The agreement covered all habitats and species in California for protection. The MOU on Biodiversity was followed by the Endangered Species Act which applied to all of the United States. Epistemic communities have a direct effect on agenda setting in intergovernmental organizations and indirect effect on the behavior of small countries. The ideas and policies of an epistemic community can become orthodoxy through the work of that community and through socialization. However, their effect is limited because there is a need for a shock to cause policy makers to seek epistemic community.

Point of Honor

Point of Honor is a historic home located at Lynchburg, Virginia. It is an irregular shaped two-story Federal mansion of stuccoed brick. The facade is composed of a three-bay center section flanked by two octagonal ended projections. Construction was started in 1806, and completed in 1815. The property has commanding views of the city and the James River. Its most famous occupant was Dr. George Cabell, who was a friend of Thomas Jefferson, and physician to Patrick Henry. It was later owned by Judge William Daniel, Jr., father of United States Senator John Warwick Daniel, "the Lame Lion of Lynchburg." During and immediately after the Civil War it was owned and occupied by Colonel Robert L. Owen Sr., who was President of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, and whose son Robert Latham Owen Jr. later became a United States Senator. Robert L. Owen Sr. died a financially ruined man in 1873, and his widow and sons were obliged to give up Point of Honor.
The house is currently operated as a house museum by the City of Lynchburg. It bears a strong relationship to the Hancock-Wirt-Caskie House in Richmond, Virginia.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

Olean High School shooting

The Olean High School shooting was a school shooting that occurred on December 30, 1974 at Olean High School in Olean, New York, United States. The gunman, 17-year-old Anthony F. Barbaro, an honor student and member of the school's rifle team, indiscriminately shot at people on the street from windows at the third floor of the school building. Three people were killed and another 11 people were injured during the shooting.
On November 1, 1975, Barbaro hanged himself in his prison cell at the Cattaraugus County Jail.
Details.
The incident began during the afternoon of December 30, 1974, when Barbaro left his house with his mother's car. He told his brother Chris that he was going target shooting. He arrived at Olean High School at approximately 2:50 p.m. After leaving his car, he entered the school building through an opened side entrance and proceeded to the third floor where he set off a smoke bomb. Unable to open the locked door to the student council room, Barbaro shot off the lock, entered the student council room, and tied the door shut. A 12-man custodial crew was doing routine maintenance in the basement of the school at this time. When they heard a fire alarm sound, the 12-man maintenance crew rushed to the third floor where they smelled smoke and heard gun shots. Eleven of the men then retreated to the ground floor. Anthony Barbaro was then confronted by Earl Metcalf, one of the custodians, who was investigating the source of the smoke. Barbaro, then seeing Metcalf through the glass window of the student council room, shot and killed him. Barbaro then positioned himself in the student council room on the third floor of the school. There, he began shooting at people outside of the school.
While a secretary was calling the Olean Fire Department, George Pancio, a school administrator, rushed to the third floor where he found Melcalf's body lying in the corridor and thought Melcalf was overcome by smoke. Pancio began dragging Melcalf's body out of the area, but soon realized that Melcalf had been shot in the chest and was dead. Pancio then fled and returned to the first floor. Pancio said twenty shots were fired in about an hour's time span. By 5:20 p.m., over 50 local and county police officers were surrounding the school building, and a National Guard armored vehicle had arrived to remove the injured victims. Two police officers and four national guardsmen soon entered the school and threw two tear gas grenades into the student council room, where Barbaro was found unconscious inside the room wearing a defective gas mask. Barbaro was laid onto a stretcher and transported by ambulance to the hospital, examined and, suffering no injuries, was then transferred to the Olean City Jail.
According to police Barbaro had fired 31 shots. Three people were killed in the shooting, and eleven others were wounded. Those killed were Earl Metcalf, Neal Pilon, and Carmen Wright Drayton, who was six months pregnant. Earl Metcalf, 62, was killed inside the school building, while Columbia Gas Co. employee Neal Pilon, 58, was shot while crossing the street outside of the school. Carmen Wright, 25, was shot in the head inside her car while driving by the school. Both Pilon and Wright were pronounced "dead on arrival" at Olean General Hospital. Seven people survived the shooting with gunshot wounds, while four others sustained injuries from flying glass fragments. Eight of the wounded victims were Olean city firemen responding to a fire complaint at the school.
Perpetrator and motives.
The perpetrator of the shooting was 17-year-old Anthony F. Barbaro, a lifelong Olean resident. He had attended Olean High School, where he was an honor student and a star marksman on his school's rifle team. He ranked eighth highest academic score in his senior class, and was inducted into the National Honor Society in February 1974. He had also won a Regents Scholarship to New York University that December. Those who knew Barbaro remember him as being quiet, and his school principal described him as a "more of a loner than not.". Louis Nicol, former principal of Olean High School, said that Barbaro excelled scholastically and caused no disciplinary problems at school. Barbaro lived in Olean, New York, with his parents and his three younger siblings – sister Cecile, brothers Steven and Chris. His father was an executive of a successful manufacturing firm, while Anthony worked with his mother at a local fast-food restaurant. Barbaro had also shown an interest in engineering, and had hoped to become a scientist.
Police have found no apparent motives as to why Barbaro committed his crimes. A teammate of Barbaro on the school's rifle team recalls Barbaro having spoken of wanting to "hold up" the Olean Armory and engage in a police-standoff. Barbaro had just tried out for the bowling team but did not qualify.
In a note explaining his motives Barbaro wrote: "I guess I just wanted to kill the person I hate most -- myself, I just didn't have the courage. I wanted to die, but I couldn't do it, so I had to get someone to do it for me. It didn't work out."
Aftermath.
On December 31, 1974, Anthony Barbaro was arraigned on three counts of second-degree murder, six counts of first-degree assault, and five counts of first-degree reckless endangerment. Barbaro was then being held without bail at the Olean City Jail. Following the shooting, police had found homemade smoke bombs, as well as gasoline and glass bottles, and empty propane canisters in Barbaro's bedroom. Police also found, in Barbaro's bedroom, bomb recipes and a journal that detailed his plans for the shooting. In April 1975, he had entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, however he was found competent to stand trial by two court-appointed psychiatrists. Barbaro was soon transferred from the Olean City Jail to the Cattaraugus County Jail in Little Valley. On October 21, 1975, a grand jury was seated for Barbaro's trial at the Olean Municipal Building. On October 27, defense attorney Vincent E. Doyle, Jr. presented his testimony at a preliminary hearing, stating that Barbaro had a "serious, deep-rooted mental illness that precluded his conviction." On November 1, 1975, Barbaro hanged himself with a bedsheet in his cell at the Cattaraugus County Jail. Cattaraugus County coroner Dr. Harry C. Law ruled the death a suicide. Barbaro had written three suicide notes that were found on his bed in his cell. One note was addressed to his family, another note was addressed to a woman he corresponded with in prison, and the third note was addressed "to whom it may concern".
The third note read:
Wounded victims.
A total of eleven people survived the shooting with injuries.

Daifallah Bouramiya is a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, representing the fourth district. Born in 1957, Bouramiya studied public health and worked in as a doctor before being elected to the National Assembly in 2003. He is an independent deputy.
Removing Health Minister Al-Jarallah.
On April 4, 2005, Bouramiya grilled Health Minister Mohammad Al-Jarallah over alleged mismanagement, leading the minister to resign two days later. As party of the grilling, Bouramiya read out a long list of accusations, including deterioration of health services and squandering of public funds in medical purchases and hospital rehabilitation projects. The minister resigned before he could be brought before a no-confidence vote, which was to be led by Bouramiya and ten other MPs. Some newspapers alleged that the MPs behind the motion were upset that no member of the powerful Awazem tribe or Shiite had been named minister in recent Cabinet changes.
Resignation of Oil Minister Bader Mishari al-Humaidhi.
After Al-Humaidhi was appointed oil minister in the October 28, 2007, cabinet shuffle, Bouramiya and Musallam AlـBarrak wanted to question him about failing to curb consumer debts and embezzlement in state investments abroad during his time as finance minister. The prime minister preempted the parliamentary grilling and angered lawmakers who accused him of covering up corruption and undermining their constitutional right to question ministers.
The political standoff reached unprecedented levels when the prime minister and the speaker of the house, Jassem Al-Kharafi, exchanged criticism and accusations in a television interview and a statement published in the country's newspapers.
Opposed Guaranteeing Bank Deposits.
On October 28, 2008, the parliament voted 50-7 to insure all types of deposits in all local banks within Kuwait. Bouramiya opposed the bill, along with Jabir Al-Azmi, Hussein AlـQallaf Al-Bahraini, Mohammed Al-Obaid, Mohammed Hayef AlـMutairi, Musallam AlـBarrak, and Waleed AlـTabtabaie. Bouramiya accused the Cabinet of speeding up the bill's passage for the benefit of monetary tycoons.
Advanced Treatment Hospital.
On January 1, 2009, Bouramiya submitted a draft law to set up a specialty hospital to treat Kuwaiti citizens who require advanced medical treatment. The document states that a separate hospital to treat critical cases be built and suggests that government own 50 percent shares while the rest be open for public subscription.
Walk-Out Protest Against Cabinet.
On January 13, 2009, Bouramiya and ten other MPs walked out of the year's first session complaining of a lack of new faces in the new cabinet.

East Grand Boulevard Historic District

The East Grand Boulevard Historic District is a historic district located along East Grand Boulevard between East Jefferson Avenue and Mack Aveue in Detroit, Michigan. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
History.
During the late 19th century, creating wide, graceful streets was seen as a way to create a beautiful city. After much debate, in the 1890s Detroit adopted the idea of creating a "Grand Boulevard" encircling the city. By 1913, the landscaped Grand Boulevard was generally recognized as a major adornment of the city, and a prestigious address in which to reside.
Houses built along this section of the Boulevard were among the grandest in the city at the time they were built; however, by the mid-1920s, the appeal of living along Grand Boulevard declined. During the Great Depression and later during World War II, some of these massive elegant homes in this historic district were cut up into small apartments. Currently, this section of Grand Boulevard has become a mixed-use neighborhood. Only a few of these homes are still used as single-family residences; many serve as group homes for those who need institutional care.
Description.
The East Grand Boulevard Historic District includes a few moderate-sized apartment buildings and numerous large homes. The apartment buildings in the district include the El Tovar Apartments, Saint Paul Manor Apartments, and Kingston Arms Apartments. Structures in this district were constructed primarily between 1900 and 1925.

Jophery Brown

Jophery Clifford Brown (January 22, 1945 – January 11, 2014), also credited as Jophrey Brown, was a pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Chicago Cubs, as well as a talented stunt man and actor. 
Baseball career.
Brown, a Grambling State University product, was drafted three times by major league teams (including the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Pirates) before finally signing with the Cubs on June 20, 1966. He made his only major league appearance on September 21, 1968 against Pittsburgh at Forbes Field. Brown relieved Bobby Tiefenauer, who had in turn relieved the Cubs' starter that day, Joe Niekro. He allowed one run in two innings of work, memorably retiring opposing pitcher Dock Ellis on a line drive back to the mound for the final out of his debut. Brown was removed for pinch-hitter Clarence Jones in the next inning. He would never pitch in the majors again.
Acting career.
Brown's first television role was uncredited as a police officer on a 1964 episode of "Arrest and Trial", titled "The Black Flower." He first worked as a stunt man the next year on episodes of "I Spy". On one of those episodes, Brown also played an uncredited role as a reporter on a 1965 "I Spy" episode, "So Long, Patrick Henry." 
His next work in Hollywood didn't come until 1973 in "Coffy", when Brown played uncredited roles as both a party guest and a stunt man. That began a 35-year career during which he acted in 35 films and did stunts in 115. Brown worked in as many as seven movies in a year.
Recognition came in the form of a World Stunt Award for Best Work with a Vehicle. He shared the award with nine others for a car-chase scene in "Bad Boys II". Brown also was nominated with six others for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture in "Wanted". That 2008 film was the last in which he worked.
Other career highlights included working as a stunt double for Morgan Freeman in three films -- "Along Came a Spider" (2001), "The Sum of All Fears" (2002) and "Dreamcatcher" (2003). Brown was the stunt coordinator on seven motion pictures -- "The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings" (1975), "Scarface" (1983), "Action Jackson" and "Miracle at Beekman's Place" (1988), "Graffiti Bridge" (1990), "House Party 3" (1994) and "Sometimes They Come Back... Again" (1996).
His baseball background was helpful for "Bingo Long," in which he worked both as stunt coordinator and in the role of All-Stars third baseman Emory "Champ" Chambers.
Brown's last acting role was an uncredited part as a chef in "Spider-Man" (2002).

Kurumi Morishita

Life and career.
Morishita was born on July 29, 1979 in Akita, Japan. In an interview from early in her career she describes her difficult family life. Her father was a physically abusive alcoholic who terrorized her and her brother until her parents' divorce when Morishita was in her junior year in high school. Although she considered her mother her only parent, she remained in touch with her father. She says that her early need for self-reliance caused her not to trust others or be able to open up to people. The interviewer describes her as having an "unusually cold and solitary personality." Morishita attended the Akita Technical High School and then worked as a shop girl in Tokyo. She was recruited into the AV industry in Tokyo's Shinjuku district.
AV debut - SOD.
Morishita began her adult video career in September 1998 at age nineteen with the Soft On Demand studio where she began her long association with the director TOHJIRO. For the next three years under an exclusive contract she continued to make videos for SOD, an "indie" studio known for more hardcore activities than some of the more mainstream studios. Morishita has said that she did not think SOD was making her do hardcore scenes, but that her work was more risque than most other AV actresses and "I think the way I do them is better befitting an AV actress." Morishita was considered the studio's most prominent actress during her tenure with SOD when she was called "The Queen of Independent AVs", a title which she says she did not like. In 2002, SOD celebrated her career by issuing a four volume retrospective of her work with the studio "Kurumi Morishita - History" (森下くるみヒストリー). Each of the 2-hour compilations contained scenes from six (five for Vol. 4) of her SOD videos.
While at SOD, Murishita also starred in an SOD produced V-Cinema production directed by Kazuhiko Matsumoto and co-starring another noted director, Toru Muranishi. The video, based on the manga of the same name, was released in joint adult (90 min) and softcore (60 min.) versions by SOD in July 2000.
Dogma.
Dogma studio was founded by director TOHJIRO in 2001 as part of SOD but in 2002 broke off to become an independent company. At that time Morishita left SOD to join Dogma and TOHJIRO as a contract actress. Morishita has starred in most of the genres popular at Dogma which is known for its extreme and sometimes bizarre fetish videos which include bondage, forced fellatio and various S&M themes.
Morishita has won acclaim for her lesbian-themed videos including the December 2002 title for Dogma, "Mourning Dress Sisters, Close Relative Lesbian". In this fictional melodrama about two sisters experimenting with lesbian sex after the death of their mother, one reviewer comments that the performances are carried off with such conviction that the scenes become love scenes rather than sex scenes. She also co-starred in a June 2003 production by KMP entitled "Forest in Nude". Directed by TOHJIRO, a reviewer call this a "soft, bittersweet story of two friends who remember the days of their youth and the sexual experiences they had". In December 2005 she and director TOHJIRO returned to make peace at their old studio SOD with "Stripper", a lesbian love story with SOD star Nana Natsume.
Her popularity as an actress continued at Dogma, in 2003 the major Japanese video distributor DMM ranked her No. 4 in its list of the 100 top actresses by sales. She made the top 10 again in 2004, being ranked No. 9. She is known as "the goddess of Dogma" Morishita also received one of the Channel Actress Performance Awards at the 2005 Adult Broadcasting Awards for the 2004 broadcast season on the Non Stop channel.
She made her first interracial video in November 2006, "BLACK・KURUMI", admitting according to the Dogma blurb "I am a bit apprehensive but you have to push your limits to keep going further." In a later video "Killer Kurumi", released January 2007 and directed by KINGDOM, there is a rather elaborate fictional plot. In prison for murder, she is offered her freedom in exchange for working for "the company". This consists of seducing targets and then executing them after sex - until she falls in love with one of her targets. She made only a few other original videos for Dogma in 2007 and 2008 and she announced her retirement in her blog in May 2009.
After AV retirement.
Morishita has kept a detailed blog of her life and activities since February 2003, but her literary activities have extended beyond blogging. In March 2007, she published a diary-like account of her life called . In the book she describes her longing for family love and her loneliness which led her into AV work. She says she intended the book to be read by women and was "a bit embarrassed" that men would also read it. The book was made into a movie of the same name in 2012 with Morishita collaborating with director-writer Saku Nakamachi on the screenplay. The R-18 movie, starring former AKB48 singer Risa Narita as Morishita, was released in Japan in February 2012.
Morishita published a second book concerning life in the AV industry in 2011 titled . Since her first book involved only her views, she wanted to broaden the perspective by interviewing other AV actresses about their experiences and lives. The eight actresses included Elly Akira and Maria Ozawa.
She has also published fiction, the story "Dahlia" (ダリア) in Vol. 5 of the literary magazine Esora (エソラ) in August 2008 and a novel, "Ryuuka Suigin" (硫化水銀), in the February 2008 issue of the literary monthly "Contemporary Fiction" (小説現代), which was also published in digital form in October 2008.
Morishita made her first mainstream movie in April 2011, starring in director Yu Irie's , a drama about lives being changed by a rock group's upcoming concert. In December 2012, Morishita starred in the romantic fantasy directed by Toshirō Enomoto and written by Shinji Imaoka. Her co-star in the film was another former AV actress, Sasa Handa.

Spence Broughton

Spence Broughton (c1746–14 April 1792) was a highwayman who was executed for robbing the Sheffield and Rotherham mail. After his execution he gained notoriety because his body was gibbeted at the scene of the crime on Attercliffe Common between Sheffield and Rotherham, where it hung for 36 years.
Biography.
Little is known of Broughton's early life. He is thought to have been born near Sleaford in Lincolnshire. The son of a farmer, he took up farming too, married and had three children. He developed a gambling habit and left his wife for the cock-fighting scenes of Sheffield, Grantham and Derby.
The crime.
The robbery took place on 29 January or 9 February 1791 (sources differ) at Ickles, on the Rotherham edge of Attercliffe Common. Broughton and his accomplice John Oxley stayed in Sheffield the night before the robbery and then walked out of the town on the Rotherham road where they met the mail coming towards Sheffield. However, they intended to rob it on its way back to Rotherham so they lay in wait for it to arrive. George Leasley, the boy driving the mail cart described that he was led into a field, blindfolded with a handkerchief, and his hands tied behind his back and fixed to a hedge. After about an hour he freed himself and found his horse, but the Rotherham post bag was gone. Broughton and Oxley escaped towards Mansfield. On their way they went through the contents of the post bag and found that the only item of value was a French bill of exchange worth £123, they disposed of the rest of the contents in a brook, and parted; Oxley proceeding to London to cash the bill.
Capture and trial.
Broughton and Oxley were arrested, along with John Shaw, in London in October 1791 following further robberies at Cambridge and Aylesbury. Broughton was sent to Newgate Prison, and Oxley to Clerkenwell Prison. Though it has since been alleged that Shaw was the instigator of the crimes, at trial Shaw gave evidence that Broughton was the ring-leader—Oxley alleged that he did this because he and Broughton shared an interest in the same woman. Oxley himself escaped from Clerkenwell on 31 October, leaving Broughton to stand trial alone.
The trial took place in York on 24 March 1792. Shaw testified that Broughton and Oxley had come to him after robbing the Rotherham mail to ask him where they could cash the £123 bill. Next to testify was John Close, who said that he had met Broughton in London looking for Oxley, and Broughton had complained to him that Oxley had not given him his share of the proceeds from the robbery. John Townsend, the arresting officer, described the events on the day of the arrest, after which the jury found Broughton guilty and the judge, Mr. Justice Buller, sentenced him to death by hanging "and afterwards to be hung in chains on the Common, within three miles of Sheffield, where the robbery was committed." The trial took only 90 minutes.
Spence Broughton was executed at Tyburn near York on 14 April 1792. In the days before his execution Broughton is purported to have shown great remorse, writing:
Surely I have greatly transgressed the laws both of God and man! In what manner shall a sinful wretch, like me, presume to approach the throne of mercy? Alas! my repeated provocations do now wound me to the very soul.
At his execution he is reported to have professed his innocence, "saying that he was a murdered man; that, though he came down with the intent to rob the mail, he was six miles from the place at the time of the robbery", though he admitted receiving part of the proceeds.
Gibbeting and folklore.
On 16 April Broughton's body was taken to Attercliffe Common to be hung in a gibbet. George Drabble, the keeper of a pub called the "Arrow" that was located near the site, reported that crowds started to gather on the common the day before. The gibbet is reported to have attracted 40,000 visitors to the Common on the first day alone. Broughton's body remained hanging in the gibbet on Attercliffe Common for nearly 36 years. It was finally removed in 1827 when Henry Sorby, who had bought the land it stood on, had it cut down because he had grown tired of trespassers on his land. The remains of the gibbet post were claimed to have been rediscovered in 1867 when a solid oak post was found embedded in a framework in the ground during excavations for the cellars of some new houses in Clifton Street, Attercliffe Common. The discovery once again drew large crowds to Attercliffe Common.
The length of time that the rotting body of Spence Broughton hung on Attercliffe Common and the great interest that it attracted led to Broughton becoming a hero of local folklore. One story was that a group of drunken potters from the "Don Pottery", passing the site of the gibbet, threw stones at the skeleton and managed to dislodge two fingers. Taking these as trophies they were calcined and incorporated into the body of a jug. Songs were also written about Broughton including "Spence Broughton" reported by C. J. Davison Ingledew and "Spence Broughton's Lament" by Joseph Mather:
Hark, his blood, in strains so piercing,
Cries for justice night and day;
In these words which I'm rehersing,
Now methinks I hear him say—
"Thou, who art my spirit's portion
In the realms of endless bliss,
When at first thou gav'st me motion
Knew that I should come to this.
The fate of John Oxley became the subject of speculation, with reports that he was smuggled out of Folkestone to America. However, the Sheffield newspapers reported in January 1793 that Oxley had been discovered dead of hunger and cold in a barn on Loxley Moor near Sheffield.

From 1983 to 1989, she served as a member of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. She has been the Mayor of Aix-en-Provence since 2001. She banned homeless people from being drunk on the streets. In June 2011, she also voted against same-sex marriage. She is one of the French politician who holds the most elected positions at different levels of government. She is a recipient of the Legion of Honour.
Shortly after François Hollande was elected President in 2012, she suggested he might be "illegitimate", arguing that the entire French media and labor unions supported him and unfairly criticized Nicolas Sarkozy's tenure, and she asked the Constitutional Council of France to annul the election results; however, she was rebutted.
Personal life.
Her former husband, Alain Joissains, served as the Mayor of Aix-en-Provence from 1978 to 1983. Now divorced, their daughter Sophie Joissains is a member of the French Senate.

Bahá'í Faith in Zimbabwe

In 1916-1917 a series of letters by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, asked the followers of the religion to take the religion to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. In 1929 Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, was the first Bahá'í to visit the area. In 1953 several Bahá'ís settled in what was then South Rhodesia as pioneers. Along with indigenous conversions in 1955 the Bahá'ís formed the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was formed in Harare. By the end of 1963 there were 9 assemblies and more smaller groups and isolated members of the religion. While still a colony of the United Kingdom, the Bahá'ís nevertheless organized a separate National Spiritual Assembly in 1964. Though Rhodesia declared independence in 1965, succeeding political developments and wars changed the status of the country and the National Assembly was reformed and has continued since 1970 while Zimbabwe regained independence in 1980. By 2003, the 50th anniversary of the Bahá'ís in Zimbabwe, a year of events across the country culminated with a conference of Bahá'ís from all provinces of Zimbabwe and nine countries. There were 43 local spiritual assemblies in 2003.
Early phase.
In a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States and Canada in 1916-1917 by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, asked the followers of the religion to take the religion to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The publication was delayed until 1919 in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919 after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. 
In 1929 Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, was the first Bahá'í to visit the area and then came again with his wife, Rúhíyyih Khanum, in 1940-1. They visited the Victoria Falls, Matopos, and Bulawayo. 
Early in 1953 Izzat'u'llah Zahrai from Iran attempted to settled in what was then South Rhodesia but his application for residency was rejected. Along with Zahrai, Claire Gung, Eyneddin and Tahirih Ala'i, (some from the United Kingdom), and Dr. Kenneth and Mrs. Roberta Christian, American Bahá'í pioneers, were each credited with being Knights of Bahá'u'lláh for Southern Rhodesia and were under strict instructions by the Guardian to attempt to spread the religion among the indigenous peoples, not the settlers. However the Christians knew Sylvia and "Sue" (Salvator) Benatar, who though Sephardic Jews, became Bahá'ís after the Christians left Zimbabwe when they came in contact with Larry and Carol Hautz who were succeeding pioneers. Later Mrs. Benatar performed with Norman Bailey. The Hautz' established a motel, service station, and a snake farm for venom on the Bulawayo road just outside Harare. The school was initially for the 20 indigenous children of the staff, but it eventually expanded to a total enrollment of 400.
The first indigenous person to accept the Faith was Morton Ndovi in January 1955 who soon pioneered to Malawi and then Nyasaland. Other local people accepted the Faith soon afterwards, and in April that same year the first Local Spiritual Assembly was formed in Harare (then called Salisbury). The region was gathered together under a regional National Spiritual Assembly of South West Africa in 1956. The first African woman to become a Baha'i in Zimbabwe was Mabel Chiposi, who accepted the religion in 1957. Wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in 1950s and extend in the 1960s. By the end of 1963 there were several communities of Bahá'ís including nine Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies:
Growth.
Hand of the Cause John Robarts lived in Bulawayo with his family from 1957 to 1967. While still a colony of the United Kingdom, the Bahá'ís nevertheless organized a separate National Spiritual Assembly in 1964, and Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga represented the Universal House of Justice at the first national convention. Though Rhodesia declared independence in 1965, succeeding political developments and wars changed the status of the country and the National Assembly was reformed and has continued since 1970. In October 1979 some 60 members of the religion from nine communities in Matabeleland participated in the first regional conference at Bulawayo. In April 1980 more than 50 attended the four-day summer school at the national Center in Salisbury. Zimbabwe regained independence in 1980. In 1983 the national convention had 67 delegates. In 1985 182 local assemblies were elected and some one hundred women attended a National Bahá'í Women's Conference. Bahá'ís estimated the Zimbabwean community at 20,000 in 1985, a 20 fold increase from 1971.
Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1984 a literacy project was begun and operated entirely by local members of the religion. In 1986 the Bahá'ís of Zimbabwe hosted a conference on the education of children with speakers from government ministries and UNICEF addressing the meetings and coverage by radio stations. By 1988 teacher training for tutorial schools, literacy and pre-school programs was held in Zimbabwe. In November 1988 a national women's conference gathered 71 Bahá'ís. In 1989 a Bahá'í expert and businessman in using appropriate technology from Swaziland traveled through six southern and eastern African countries including Zimbabwe training local people in the manufacture of several kinds of fence-making machines and other technologies in building, agriculture and water programs. The 10-day training courses were organized by the National Spiritual Assemblies in each of the six countries. Two major arts events took place in Zimbabwe in 1994 among the Bahá'ís. The first was a national music and drama congress, held in August in Mhondoro, with approximately 200 attending. The drama group from Murewa and the Epworth children's choir won in their respective categories. The second major event was in December with participants 30 different countries for the Zimbabwe Bahá'í International Summer School and Music and Drama Festival. In the music competition of that event, a group called Voice of the Youth, from Bulawayo, walked away with the first prize, the Murewa Choir came second, and the Epworth Choir came third.
Modern community.
After smaller regional congresses held throughout the nation, Bahá'ís from all provinces of Zimbabwe and nine countries attended the festivities of the 50th anniversary of the Bahá'í Faith in Zimbabwe that were held from 12 to 14 December 2003. The festivities included performances by groups "Isitsha Sothando" from Ndebele tribe, "Letters of the Living," from Mashonaland Central Province, and others. Some 80 Bahá'ís from Zimbabwe, including a 2008 member of the National Spiritual Assembly, attended the first of 41 conferences called for by the Universal House of Justice in October for between November and February 2008-9, held in neighboring Zambia along with Bahá'ís from Malawi.
Demographics.
As of 2003 Bahá'ís lived in more than 1,600 localities in urban and rural areas of Zimbabwe, and there are 43 local spiritual assemblies. There are Bahá'í centers in Harare, Bulawayo, Chinamora, Mubaira, and Murewa.

Medical simulation

Medical simulation is a branch of simulation technology related to education and training in medical fields of various industries. It can involve simulated human patients, educational documents with detailed simulated animations, casualty assessment in homeland security and military situations, and emergency response. Its main purpose is to train medical professionals to reduce accidents during surgery, prescription, and general practice. However it is now used to train students in anatomy and physiology during their clinical training as allied health professionals. These professions include nursing, sonography, pharmacy assistants and physical therapy. Advances in technology are advancing geometrically and a McGraw Hill textbook, Medical Simulation, by VanCura and Bisset interfaces the simulator technology with any medically related course of study.
Many medical professionals are skeptical about simulation, saying that medicine, surgery, and general healing skills are too complex to simulate accurately. But technological advances in the past two decades have made it possible to simulate practices from yearly family doctor visits to complex operations such as heart surgery.
An increase in recent emergency and military scenario simulation has helped medical providers in Middle East war zones.
Disaster response is made easier and conducted by better trained individuals due to the rapid availability of simulators in schools, hospitals, military facilities, and research labs.
History.
The first uses of medical simulation can be traced back to anesthesia physicians in order to reduce accidents. When simulation skyrocketed in popularity during the 1930s due to the invention of the Link Trainer for flight and military applications, many different field experts attempted to adapt simulation to their own needs. Due to limitations in technology and overall medical knowledge to a specific degree at the time, medical simulation did not take off as acceptable training until much later. When the sheer cost effectiveness and training of which simulation was capable surfaced during extensive military use, hardware/software technology increased exponentially, and medical standards were established, medical simulation became entirely possible, affordable, standardized, and accepted.
By the 1980s software simulations became available. With the help of a UCSD School of Medicine student, "Computer Gaming World" reported that "Surgeon" (1986) for the Apple Macintosh very accurately simulated operating on an aortic aneurysm. Others followed, such as "Life & Death" (1988).
Modern medical simulation.
The American Board of Emergency Medicine employs the use of medical simulation technology in order to accurately judge students by using "patient scenarios" during oral board examinations. However, these forms of simulation are a far cry from high fidelity models that have surfaced since the 1990s.
Due to the fact that computer simulation technology is still relatively new relative to flight and military simulators, there is still much research to be done about the best way to approach medical training through simulation. That said, successful strides are being made in terms of medical education and training. A thorough amount of studies has have shown that students engaged in medical simulation training have overall higher scores and retention rates than those trained through traditional means.
The Council of Residency Directors (CORD) has established the following recommendations for simulation
The Association of Surgeons in Training has produced recommendations for the introduction, availability and role of simulation in surgical training
Training.
The main purpose of medical simulation is to properly educate students in various fields through the use of high technology simulators. According to the Institute of Medicine, 44,000 to 98,000 deaths annually are recorded due primarily to medical mistakes during treatment. Other statistics include:
If 44,000 to 98,000 deaths are the direct result of medical mistakes, and the CDC reported in 1999 that roughly 2.4 million people died in the United States, the medical mistakes estimate represents 1.8% to 4.0% of all deaths, respectively.
A near 5% representation of deaths primarily related to medical mistakes is simply unacceptable in the world of medicine. Anything that can assist in bringing this number down is highly recommended and medical simulation has proven to be the key assistant.
Examples.
The following is a list of examples of common medical simulators used for training. 
Advantages.
Studies have shown that students perform better and have higher retention rates than colleagues under strict traditional methods of medical training. The table below shows the results of tests given to 20 students using highly advanced medical simulation training materials and others given traditional paper based tests. It was found that high technology learning students outperformed traditional students significantly.
In addition to overall better scores for medical students, several other distinct advantages exist not specifically related to training.
Military and emergency response.
One of the single largest proponents behind simulators has always been the United States government. Billions (and perhaps trillions, at this point) of dollars have been spent in the name of advancing simulators for space exploration, computer advancements, medical and military training, and other projects funded for research by the government. The Department of Defense (most notably, the Army) is one of the largest fund producers for simulation research, training, and support. As such, most simulators tend to be created for military purposes including soldier, tank, and flight training in combat situations. In terms of medical simulation, military applications have played a large part in its success and funding. Some examples of scenarios useful for medical applications include casualty assessment, war trauma response, emergency evacuations, training for communications between teams, team/individual after action assessment, and scenario recreation from recorded data.
Combat trauma patient simulator.
The Combat Trauma Patient Simulation Program is perhaps the most vast in terms of processes and people involved at one or sequential times. According to Kincaid, Donovan, and Pettitt, the CTPS program has been created in order to assess and analyze the feasibility of simulation in a battlefield environment. Combat casualties, massively destructive outbreaks, chemical spills, gas leaks, and other forms of large scale negative events can be accurately simulated in a safe, inexpensive, and relatively small environment.
One of the rather large advantages to such a massive simulation of intertwining processes is the fact that people ranging from the field medics all the way up to the hospitals located in key military bases receive proper training for potential casualty prevention. The process of simulation begins with the Point of Injury and leads into Casualty Collection Points, Ground Medical Evacuations, Medical Aid Stations, and finally Hospitals. Another advantage is that all casualties can be monitored through high-tech computer software and GPS receivers located in medical vehicles and in key medical clothing. By monitoring such data, leaders can be aware of which areas in the flow needs to be sped up, slowed down, moved to a different format, or removed completely. The flow between the Point of Injury and Hospital is required to be uninterrupted if a successful goal is to be met.
Live field exercises are another benefit of the CTPS program. By allowing many individuals to engage in a “live fire” simulation, people can become acquainted with the processes involved in transferring duties among team mates in order to keep the flow moving between locations. While there is the chance of these simulations not inspiring true dedication into the actions of some participants because it is not necessarily a real disaster, the truly dedicated individuals will shine in their ability to remedy the destruction. Leaders can spot weaknesses and strengths in the participants of the simulation without worrying about every single piece of the simulation. In a real disaster, leaders would need to concentrate on individual success, team success, and overall progression. Alternatively, in a simulation of exactly the same event, the leaders could ignore certain areas in order to concentrate on the individuals involved in order to analyze weaknesses. Overall, the CTPS program is beneficial to everyone involved due to cost savings, risk reduction, personnel safety, enhanced effectiveness, and reduction of the learning curves.
CTPS contains many different technologies and smaller simulations within the rather gigantic “mother” simulation. Because the smaller simulations are potentially developed by separate companies (at times even competing companies), the interfaces have the high chance of being non-communicative or are simply incompatible without some sort of translation between the competing interfaces. All of this integration is made possible through a highly researched and deeply developed High Level Architecture containing interface modules to link up incompatible parts of the complete CTPS process.
The simulation federates (subsystems) of the CTPS involves the Lockheed Martin MILES system, the Operational Requirements-based Casualty Assessment system (ORCA), the Jackson Medical Simulation library (JMSL), and the Human Patient Simulator (HPS). By combining these systems together, trainees can be contained to their respective areas of study while also studying the possible hindrances between stages of transition.
Beginning the military casualty treatment simulation is the MILES engagement simulator, which accurately simulates gunfire and other combat engagements. When trainees under the simulated engagement system fire upon each other and register virtual hits, the simulated casualties are moved to the next stage. At first glance, this system may seem similar to entertainment driven laser tag centers found within urban cities of the United States. But after a deeper look, the overall training that a user would go through involves much more than pointing, shooting, and laughing at the outcome. Proper combat procedures can be taught to single users, team based squads, or larger squads. Obvious advantages to this approach include reductions in physical harm to trainees, increase in physical realism by tagging individuals as “dead,” and providing immediate feedback to users who score a hit. While the MILES training system is not necessarily a medically based simulation; however, it is completely necessary to begin the process into medical procedures. Without proper combat engagement, realistic casualties and injuries cannot be simulated and cannot be transferred into the beginning medical stages in a manner that would provide meaning to a medical trainee.
The next stage involves casualty assessment based on results driven by simulated engagements under the MILES system. Any and all casualties are transferred to the ORCA stage, given initial wound assessments, put into an initial medical state (severe, critical, dead), and finally passed on to the JMSL. Under the JMSL, all casualties generated by MILES and assessed initially by ORCA are sent through transition phases in order to accurately simulate a casualty progressing to a more and more deadly state while awaiting treatment under average circumstances.
After casualties have been generated, processed, and sent through various stages, actual training under a medic or doctor can be attained through the HPS. By using a physiologically realistic test dummy, users can treat a patient and receive immediate, accurate feedback regarding the results. Using this approach, users can engage in proper medical training as if a live patient was being used without subjecting the patient to physical harm in the case of accidents. From a financial standpoint, the entire system offers a cheaper alternative to throwing untrained medics into a potentially hazardous and live situation. On the job training simply does not cut it when it comes to lives and equipment on the line.
In the classroom.
There are many other medical systems that exist in forms other than "live fire" and "on the field" exercises. Simulation-Based Medical Education is one form that allows students to learn for educational purposes in a classroom. SBME works well with all forms of classroom learning such as lectures, problem solving, in hospital teaching, and other traditional forms of education. Several advantages appear while using this approach such as patient safety, higher knowledge retaining, teamwork, competence, and skill at the bedside.
One of the most prominent versions of SBME that stands out is Adobe Flash based medical simulations and animations. While textbooks are sufficient for certain diagrams and process flow explanations, certain high quality animations created in Adobe Flash are extremely beneficial when it comes to learning. Some of the advantages to Flash-based medical simulations and animations include a visually animated representation of blood flow within a body or other physiological processes occurring within the body that would otherwise seem awkward or impossible to understand through static images. A rather annoying disadvantage to these animated approaches stems from the fact that they are extremely costly to create in terms of time and money. Some of the better animations require teams of people equal in size to major movie productions when it comes to after effects.

Club de Fútbol La Nucía is a Spanish football team based in La Nucía, in the autonomous community of Valencia. Founded in 1995, it plays in Tercera División – Group 6, holding home games at "Estadio Camilo Cano", which has a capacity of 3,000 spectators.
Team colours are red shirt, black shorts and socks.
History.
"Club de Fútbol La Nucía" rose from the ashes of several teams that were successively created in the city, receiving this denomination in 1995. In 1998–99, the club promoted to the first regional division for the first time, returning again to that level five years later.
The 2006–07 season was full of unexpected events. After qualifying to the promotion playoffs for Tercera División, La Nucía was eliminated by CD Olímpic de Xàtiva (1–1 draw in the first leg and 0–1 loss in the second). During the summer, however, "Club de Fútbol Dolores" forfeited its berth in the competition, with La Nucía occupying its place, with a first-ever promotion to the national categories.
In its first season in the fourth division, La Nucía finished in third position in the regular season, thus qualifying for the promotion playoffs, being eliminated by UD Las Palmas Atlético (1–1 at home, 1–2 away loss). The team met the same fate in the following campaign, being ousted by RSD Alcalá in the third round (0–2 on aggregate).

<doc id="20489385" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20489385" title="Birkhoff's representation theorem">
Birkhoff's representation theorem

In mathematics, Birkhoff's representation theorem for distributive lattices states that the elements of any finite distributive lattice can be represented as finite sets, in such a way that the lattice operations correspond to unions and intersections of sets. The theorem can be interpreted as providing a one-to-one correspondence between distributive lattices and partial orders, between quasi-ordinal knowledge spaces and preorders, or between finite topological spaces and preorders. It is named after Garrett Birkhoff, who published a proof of it in 1937.
The name “Birkhoff's representation theorem” has also been applied to two other results of Birkhoff, one from 1935 on the representation of Boolean algebras as families of sets closed under union, intersection, and complement (so-called "fields of sets", closely related to the "rings of sets" used by Birkhoff to represent distributive lattices), and Birkhoff's HSP theorem representing algebras as products of irreducible algebras. Birkhoff's representation theorem has also been called the fundamental theorem for finite distributive lattices.
Understanding the theorem.
Many lattices can be defined in such a way that the elements of the lattice are represented by sets, the join operation of the lattice is represented by set union, and the meet operation of the lattice is represented by set intersection. For instance, the Boolean lattice defined from the family of all subsets of a finite set has this property. More generally any finite topological space has a lattice of sets as its family of open sets. Because set unions and intersections obey the distributive law, any lattice defined in this way is a distributive lattice. Birkhoff's theorem states that in fact "all" finite distributive lattices can be obtained this way, and later generalizations of Birkhoff's theorem state the same thing for infinite lattices.
Examples.
Consider the divisors of some composite number, such as (in the figure) 120, partially ordered by divisibility. Any two divisors of 120, such as 12 and 20, have a unique greatest common factor 12 ∧ 20 = 4, the largest number that divides both of them, and a unique least common multiple 12 ∨ 20 = 60; both of these numbers are also divisors of 120. These two operations ∨ and ∧ satisfy the distributive law, in either of two equivalent forms: ("x" ∧ "y") ∨ "z" = ("x" ∨ "z") ∧ ("y" ∨ "z") and ("x" ∨ "y") ∧ "z" = ("x" ∧ "z") ∨ ("y" ∧ "z"), for all "x", "y", and "z". Therefore, the divisors form a finite distributive lattice.
One may associate each divisor with the set of prime powers that divide it: thus, 12 is associated with the set {2,3,4}, while 20 is associated with the set {2,4,5}. Then 12 ∧ 20 = 4 is associated with the set {2,3,4} ∩ {2,4,5} = {2,4}, while 12 ∨ 20 = 60 is associated with the set {2,3,4} ∪ {2,4,5} = {2,3,4,5}, so the join and meet operations of the lattice correspond to union and intersection of sets. 
The prime powers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 appearing as elements in these sets may themselves be partially ordered by divisibility; in this smaller partial order, 2 ≤ 4 ≤ 8 and there are no order relations between other pairs. The 16 sets that are associated with divisors of 120 are the lower sets of this smaller partial order, subsets of elements such that if "x" ≤ "y" and "y" belongs to the subset, then "x" must also belong to the subset. From any lower set "L", one can recover the associated divisor by computing the least common multiple of the prime powers in "L". Thus, the partial order on the five prime powers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 carries enough information to recover the entire original 16-element divisibility lattice.
Birkhoff's theorem states that this relation between the operations ∧ and ∨ of the lattice of divisors and the operations ∩ and ∪ of the associated sets of prime powers is not coincidental, and not dependent on the specific properties of prime numbers and divisibility: the elements of any finite distributive lattice may be associated with lower sets of a partial order in the same way.
As another example, the application of Birkhoff's theorem to the family of subsets of an "n"-element set, partially ordered by inclusion, produces the free distributive lattice with "n" generators. The number of elements in this lattice is given by the Dedekind numbers.
The partial order of join-irreducibles.
In a lattice, an element "x" is "join-irreducible" if "x" is not the join of a finite set of other elements. Equivalently, "x" is join-irreducible if it is neither the bottom element of the lattice (the join of zero elements) nor the join of any two smaller elements. For instance, in the lattice of divisors of 120, there is no pair of elements whose join is 4, so 4 is join-irreducible. An element "x" is "join-prime" if, whenever "x" ≤ "y" ∨ "z", either "x" ≤ "y" or "x" ≤ "z". In the same lattice, 4 is join-prime: whenever lcm("y","z") is divisible by 4, at least one of "y" and "z" must itself be divisible by 4.
In any lattice, a join-prime element must be join-irreducible. Equivalently, an element that is not join-irreducible is not join-prime. For, if an element "x" is not join-irreducible, there exist smaller "y" and "z" such that "x" = "y" ∨ "z". But then "x" ≤ "y" ∨ "z", and "x" is not less than or equal to either "y" or "z", showing that it is not join-prime.
There exist lattices in which the join-prime elements form a proper subset of the join-irreducible elements, but in a distributive lattice the two types of elements coincide. For, suppose that "x" is join-irreducible, and that "x" ≤ "y" ∨ "z". This inequality is equivalent to the statement that "x" = "x" ∧ ("y" ∨ "z"), and by the distributive law "x" = ("x" ∧ "y") ∨ ("x" ∧ "z"). But since "x" is join-irreducible, at least one of the two terms in this join must be "x" itself, showing that either "x" = "x" ∧ "y" (equivalently "x" ≤ "y") or "x" = "x" ∧ "z" (equivalently "x" ≤ "z").
The lattice ordering on the subset of join-irreducible elements forms a partial order; Birkhoff's theorem states that the lattice itself can be recovered from the lower sets of this partial order.
Birkhoff's theorem.
In any partial order, the lower sets form a lattice in which the lattice's partial ordering is given by set inclusion, the join operation corresponds to set union, and the meet operation corresponds to set intersection, because unions and intersections preserve the property of being a lower set. Because set unions and intersections obey the distributive law, this is a distributive lattice. Birkhoff's theorem states that any finite distributive lattice can be constructed in this way.
That is, there is a one-to-one order-preserving correspondence between elements of "L" and lower sets of the partial order. The lower set corresponding to an element "x" of "L" is simply the set of join-irreducible elements of "L" that are less than or equal to "x", and the element of "L" corresponding to a lower set "S" of join-irreducible elements is the join of "S".
If one starts with a lower set "S", lets "x" be the join of "S", and constructs lower set "T" of the join-irreducible elements less than or equal to "x", then "S" = "T". For, every element of "S" clearly belongs to "T", and any join-irreducible element less than or equal to "x" must (by join-primality) be less than or equal to one of the members of "S", and therefore must (by the assumption that "S" is a lower set) belong to "S" itself. Conversely, if one starts with an element "x" of "L", lets "S" be the join-irreducible elements less than or equal to "x", and constructs "y" as the join of "S", then "x" = "y". For, as a join of elements less than or equal to "x", "y" can be no greater than "x" itself, but if "x" is join-irreducible then "x" belongs to "S" while if "x" is the join of two or more join-irreducible items then they must again belong to "S", so "y" ≥ "x". Therefore, the correspondence is one-to-one and the theorem is proved.
Functoriality.
Birkhoff's theorem, as stated above, is a correspondence between individual partial orders and distributive lattices. However, it can also be extended to a correspondence between order-preserving functions of partial orders and bounded homomorphisms of the corresponding distributive lattices. The direction of these maps is reversed in this correspondence.
Let 2 denote the partial order on the two-element set {0, 1}, with the order relation 0 < 1, and (following Stanley) let "J(P)" denote the distributive lattice of lower sets of a finite partial order "P". Then the elements of "J(P)" correspond one-for-one to the order-preserving functions from "P" to 2. For, if ƒ is such a function, ƒ−1(0) forms a lower set, and conversely if "L" is a lower set one may define an order-preserving function ƒ"L" that maps "L" to 0 and that maps the remaining elements of "P" to 1. If "g" is any order-preserving function from "Q" to "P", one may define a function "g"* from "J(P)" to "J(Q)" that uses the composition of functions to map any element "L" of "J(P)" to ƒ"L" ∘ "g". This composite function maps "Q" to 2 and therefore corresponds to an element "g"*("L") = (ƒ"L" ∘ "g")−1(0) of "J(Q)". Further, for any "x" and "y" in "J(P)", "g"*("x" ∧ "y") = "g"*("x") ∧ "g"*("y") (an element of "Q" is mapped by "g" to the lower set "x" ∩ "y" if and only if belongs both to the set of elements mapped to "x" and the set of elements mapped to "y") and symmetrically "g"*("x" ∨ "y") = "g"*("x") ∨ "g"*("y"). Additionally, the bottom element of "J(P)" (the function that maps all elements of "P" to 0) is mapped by "g"* to the bottom element of "J(Q)", and the top element of "J(P)" is mapped by "g"* to the top element of "J(Q)". That is, "g"* is a homomorphism of bounded lattices.
However, the elements of "P" themselves correspond one-for-one with bounded lattice homomorphisms from "J(P)" to 2. For, if "x" is any element of "P", one may define a bounded lattice homomorphism "jx" that maps all lower sets containing "x" to 1 and all other lower sets to 0. And, for any lattice homomorphism from "J(P)" to 2, the elements of "J(P)" that are mapped to 1 must have a unique minimal element "x" (the meet of all elements mapped to 1), which must be join-irreducible (it cannot be the join of any set of elements mapped to 0), so every lattice homomorphism has the form "jx" for some "x". Again, from any bounded lattice homomorphism "h" from "J(P)" to "J(Q)" one may use composition of functions to define an order-preserving map "h"* from "Q" to "P". It may be verified that "g"** = "g" for any order-preserving map "g" from "Q" to "P" and that and "h"** = "h" for any bounded lattice homomorphism "h" from "J(P)" to "J(Q)".
In category theoretic terminology, "J" is a contravariant hom-functor "J" = Hom(—,2) that defines a duality of categories between, on the one hand, the category of finite partial orders and order-preserving maps, and on the other hand the category of finite distributive lattices and bounded lattice homomorphisms.
Generalizations.
In an infinite distributive lattice, it may not be the case that the lower sets of the join-irreducible elements are in one-to-one correspondence with lattice elements. Indeed, there may be no join-irreducibles at all. This happens, for instance, in the lattice of all natural numbers, ordered with the reverse of the usual divisibility ordering (so "x" ≤ "y" when "y" divides "x"): any number "x" can be expressed as the join of numbers "xp" and "xq" where "p" and "q" are distinct prime numbers. However, elements in infinite distributive lattices may still be represented as sets via Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices, a form of Stone duality in which each lattice element corresponds to a compact open set in a certain topological space. This generalized representation theorem can be expressed as a category-theoretic duality between distributive lattices and coherent spaces (sometimes called spectral spaces), topological spaces in which the compact open sets are closed under intersection and form a base for the topology. Hilary Priestley showed that Stone's representation theorem could be interpreted as an extension of the idea of representing lattice elements by lower sets of a partial order, using Nachbin's idea of ordered topological spaces. Stone spaces with an additional partial order linked with the topology via Priestley separation axiom can also be used to represent bounded distributive lattices. Such spaces are known as Priestley spaces. Further, certain bitopological spaces, namely pairwise Stone spaces, generalize Stone's original approach by utilizing "two" topologies on a set to represent an abstract distributve lattice. Thus, Birkhoff's representation theorem extends to the case of infinite (bounded) distributive lattices in at least three different ways, summed up in duality theory for distributive lattices.
Birkhoff's representation theorem may also be generalized to finite structures other than distributive lattices. In a distributive lattice, the self-dual median operation
gives rise to a median algebra, and the covering relation of the lattice forms a median graph. Finite median algebras and median graphs have a dual structure
as the set of solutions of a 2-satisfiability instance; formulate this structure equivalently as the family of initial stable sets in a mixed graph. For a distributive lattice, the corresponding mixed graph has no undirected edges, and the initial stable sets are just the lower sets of the transitive closure of the graph. Equivalently, for a distributive lattice, the implication graph of the 2-satisfiability instance can be partitioned into two connected components, one on the positive variables of the instance and the other on the negative variables; the transitive closure of the positive component is the underlying partial order of the distributive lattice.
Another result analogous to Birkhoff's representation theorem, but applying to a broader class of lattices, is the theorem of that any finite join-distributive lattice may be represented as an antimatroid, a family of sets closed under unions but in which closure under intersections has been replaced by the property that each nonempty set has a removable element.

Ray Brown (National League pitcher)

Paul Percival "Ray" Brown (January 31, 1889 - May 25, 1955) was a right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs.
Brown pitched in just one big-league game, twirling a complete-game victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on September 29, 1909 at age 20. He allowed just five hits to the Phillies, walking four and striking out two in his single day on the mound at West Side Park. At the plate, he had no hits in three at-bats, but did earn a run batted in. By virtue of his brief moment in the spotlight, Brown became the tenth-youngest man to play in the National League in 1909.

Balmorhea State Park

Balmorhea State Park is a state park located on the San Solomon Springs in Reeves County, Texas, opened in 1968. The closest major town is Balmorhea, Texas. The park is open year round.
Features.
The main feature of the park is the , freshwater pool built around the springs. The spring has a constant flow of 22 to a day so no chlorination is required. The water temperature ranges from and up to deep. The pool is used for both swimming and scuba diving. Company 1856 of the Civilian Conservation Corps built the pool between 1936 and 1941. It was constructed as part of FDR's New Deal during the Great Depression as a way to open up jobs for people needing work. The Civilian Conservation Corps also built San Solomon Springs Courts, which rents rooms available for overnight stays. Camping and recreational vehicle sites are also available. 
The Balmorhea State Park Cienega Project recreated a desert wetland in the park. The cienega now serves as a habitat for endangered fish such as the Comanche Springs pupfish and Pecos gambusia as well as other aquatic life, birds and other animals.

William Blacker

Lieutenant-Colonel William Blacker (1 September 1777 – 25 November 1855) was an Irish British Army officer, Commissioner of the Treasury of Ireland, and author. His published work is sometimes attributed under the names Fitz Stewart or Colonel Blacker.
Life and career.
Born in Carrickblacker House, in the Oneilland East barony in County Armagh, he entered the University of Dublin in the 1790s. Blacker was a participant at the Battle of the Diamond. There, Blacker became one of the original members of the Orange Institution. After earning his degree, Blacker obtained a commission in the 60th Regiment of Foot, then serving in the West Indies, but poor health compelled him to return home. In 1806 he was promoted to its majority, and in 1812 rose to his final rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1816 his uncle Sir George Hill, 2nd Baronet appointed Blacker to the Commission of the Treasury of Ireland. He was confirmed Lord Dublin and was the great grandfather of Sir Cecil Blacker Commandant of Horse.
In 1829, he inherited the family estate upon his father's death. He resigned his military office shortly after and retired to Carrickblacker House. Blacker was buried in Portadown in the Old Seagoe Cemetery.
Writings.
Blacker and his relative Valentine Blacker were both lieutenant-colonels, and both were published authors. Because some of the work was published pseudonymously, the two are sometimes confused or conflated in texts. In "The Dublin University Magazine", where his work often appeared, they wrote, "We know not why Colonel Blacker has chosen not to own himself the author of some papers which in the pages of our own Magazine have excited attention of which any man might feel proud."
Blacker authored a popular and widely anthologized poem on military service, "Oliver's Advice", originally published in 1834 under his occasional pseudonym, "Fitz Stewart." The poem was widely anthologized. The poem popularized a phrase attributed to Oliver Cromwell as part of a "well-authenticated anecdote." Each stanza ends with a variant of the line, "put your trust in God, my boys, and keep your powder dry." The line appeared in "Bartlett's Familiar Quotations" attributed to Colonel Blacker.

Barony of Ladyland

The Barony of Ladyland was in the old feudal Baillerie of Cunninghame, near Kilbirnie in what is now North Ayrshire, Scotland.
The history of the Barony of Ladyland.
In the Parish of Kilbirnie were three baronies, Kilbirnie, Glengarnock and Ladyland. The first Lairds of Ladyland were a cadet branch of the Barclays of Kilbirnie. Archibald, as second son, is recorded as having the Barony of Ladyland bestowed upon him by his father, Sir Hugh Barclay. David Barclay of Ladyland was with Mary, Queen of Scots, at Hamilton in May 1568 and probably fought at the Battle of Langside where the Queen's side lost and she subsequently fled the realm.
Hugh (Hew) Barclay of Ladyland was a poet of "considerable power and humour" and a fervent papist, married to Isobel Stewart, meeting an unusual death by drowning on Ailsa Craig. Sir David Barclay of Ladyland and Auchinheiff (now 'Auchenhove') succeeded his brother Hugh and married Elizabeth Cunningham, the widow of John Craufurd of Craufurdland who had died in 1612, aged only 21, from an injury received at foot-ball. His son, also David, was unfortunate enough to inherit his father's debts and was forced to sell Ladyland to John Blair of Cloberhill in full payment. This was the end of the Barclay's involvement in the barony and by 1654 Sir David Cuninghame was the Laird of Ladyland, a property then valued at £546 17s 8d. 
Captain William Hamilton of Ardoch or Airdoch in Kilwinning Parish was the first of the Hamilton's of Ladyland (see illustration of their Coat of Arms). Lieutenant William Hamilton of Gilbertfield in Lanarkshire still owned Ladyland, but rented Gilbertfield, where he lived, making only the occasional visit to Ladyland. William was a published poet and a friend and correspondent of the poet Allan Ramsay. In 1722, Hamilton published an abridged and modernised version of Blind Harry's "Wallace", which, though an artistic failure, aroused Robert Burns's boyhood interest and enthusiasm and, as he recorded in the Autobiographical Letter: 'poured a Scottish prejudice in my veins which will boil along there till the flood gates of life shut in eternal rest.'
John Hamilton, 8th of Ardoch, 2nd of Ladyland, sold Ardoch and Ladyland c1712 and purchased Ballybregach in Northern Ireland and renamed it Ladyland. Hamilton's became well established in Ireland and the name Ladyland still exists. John Hamilton sold Ladyland to an Ensign Henry Moncrieff, Collector of Cess for Renfrewshire; Moncrieff than sold the property to Alexander, 9th Earl of Eglinton. 
William Cochran of Edge purchased Ladyland in around 1718 from the Earl of Eglinton and lived there with his wife Margaret Orr of Easter Gavin. They had a son and five daughters; William succeeding in 1756 and marrying Janet Glasgow of Pudevenholme, part of the Glengarnock estate. In 1803 their son William succeeded and married Catherine Hamilton on 5 September 1815. Catherine was a distant relation of the Hamilton's of Ladyland. They had two daughters, Agnes and Janet Glasgow Cochran; the eldest inherited upon his death in 1832; she had married William Charles Richard Patrick in April 1832. Agnes's husband, an advocate, was the second son of Dr. Robert Patrick of Trearne and Hessilhead and he took his wife's name to establish the Cochran-Patrick line.
Robert William Cochran-Patrick (1842–1897) was Dean of Faculties at Glasgow University, 1882 to 1885 and was awarded an honorary LLD by the University in 1879. Robert was born at Ladyland and studied at the University of Edinburgh and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He returned to Ayrshire to live the life of a country gentleman and study archaeology, becoming a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and in 1874 he was one of the founders of the Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Archaeological Association. Robert was best known as a numismatist and he assembled one of the country's greatest collections of early Scottish coins and medals. He wrote the two volumes of 'Records of the Coinage of Scottish.' Cochran-Patrick was Conservative MP for North Ayrshire, 1880 to 1885. He was a president of the Irvine Burns Club and also the Chairman of the Governors of the Spier's school at Beith and Provincial Grand Master of the Masons of Ayrshire. Mrs Cochran-Patrick, wife of R. W Cochran-Patrick, was the younger daughter of Mr. Hunter of Hunterston Castle. In 1969 the Lyon Court officially recognised Neil Kennedy-Cochran-Patrick (b. 1926) in the name of the Hunter of Hunterston as being 29th Laird of Hunterston and Chief of Clan Hunter.
Barclay, Montgomerie and Ailsa Craig.
As stated Hugh or Hew Barclay of Ladyland was a Roman Catholic and became involved in a plot in 1592 and upon discovery he was imprisoned in the Tolbooth in Edinburgh, but was released, by the King's directions, in 1593 following assurances of good conduct. Hugh again became involved in plotting, for which he was imprisoned for a time in the Castle of Glasgow, but escaped and fled to Spain where he was in communication with Jesuits. 
In 1597 he returned and took possession, with several others, of Ailsa Craig. He was intent on using it as a provisioning and stopping off point for a Spanish invasion that would re-establish the Catholic faith in Scotland—a plot originally established by the Earls of Angus, Errol, and Huntly. He was discovered on Ailsa Craig by the Protestant Minister of Paisley, Andrew Knox, and upon being discovered and reflecting upon his previous assurances of good conduct, he either tried to escape and had an accidental death or he deliberately drowned himself in the sea off the island. He had been a close friend of Alexander Montgomerie of Hessilhead, the famous poet, to whom he had on one occasion addressed his own poetry. Metcalfe records that Knox actually reached Ailsa Craig first and Hugh drew his sword, found himself under determined attack and falling into the sea, drowned. Knox was charged with Hugh's death by his friends, however upon appeal to the King in Council, his actions were justified as "loyal and good service done to His Majesty and country." The King forbade any to molest him, and charged all magistrates and others in office to assist in protecting him.
The history of Ladyland castle.
Ladyland or Lady Land Castle (NS 3230 5791) was the caput of the Barony of Ladyland and was a typical tower house of the 16th-century, probably with three storeys and a typical corbelled parapet around the roof; each corner originally having a small turret, later modified, probably in 1669, when a typical pitched roof was added and the building made more comfortable and less defensive for William Hamilton of Ardoch who obtained the property from the Earl of Eglinton. A more impressive door was created at the existing first floor level, a pediment above being inscribed with W.H. I.B. and dated 1669. This inscription refers to Hamilton and his Barclay bride. This pediment survives and is now above the gateway into the walled garden.
The castle had low buildings either side that looked a little like wings, and were probably for stables and storage. A sundial dated 1673 survives, and may have been built to commemorate the completion of the 'modernisation' works. In the walled garden, another stone, dated 1817, bears the inscription "W.C. C.H.".
Workers discovered a cavity in one of the walls when the castle was being partially demolished in 1815; this contained four small urns, a painted drinking glass and a large jaw bone, possibly of an ox. Two of the urns had handles and all were tightly closed with shreds or trimmings of woven cloth. One of the urns contained the breast and side bones of a chicken and the others a sort of greasy soil. A coin was found in the grounds near the old tower, bearing the legend 'FESTINA LENTE' ('Make Haste Slowly'); other details being too worn too make out. No explanation has been put forward for these articles presence here. A portion of the castle survives, about 20 feet long and 25 feet in height, forming the north elevation of the walled garden. It has an elliptical gun port in it and a rectangular window. Some square bee bole recesses are also present.
In 1691 the Hearth Tax records show that Ladyland had ten hearths and eighteen other dwellings were associated with the estate.
W. C. Patrick of Ladyland strengthened the walls of Glengarnock Castle in 1841 as recorded on a tablet attached to the building.
Ladyland House and stables.
Ladyland House is an A-listed building about two miles from Kilbirnie, and is one of David Hamilton's most picturesque country houses, designed for William Cochran. The large pilasters on each corner are a distinguishing feature for this architect and an interesting feature is the tartan-checked window-bar pattern and bold corner quoins. Hamilton also designed the nearby stables, which have since been carefully converted into private dwellings; possibly incorporating original 17th-century building work in their wings. The house was built sometime between 1816–1821. In 1925 a wing designed to blend in with the original house was added by the architect James Houston of Kilbirnie.
The Ladyland sundials.
A Scottish sundial at the stables is dated 1821, and may commemorate the completion of building works, as with the fine example of a 1673 Scottish sundial—originally from the old castle—that now stands in front of the mansion house. The older sundial stands on a pedestal more like those usually found with horizontal dials, and bears the monogram M.P.C. The 1821 dial may not have originally been made for its current graceful and highly ornamented pedestal. 
The policies and curtilage.
The Ladyland Burn runs through the site, probably deriving its name from a typical pre-reformation chapel, long forgotten, such as those at Trearne, Blair House, Chapeltoun House, etc. The Maich Water rises from Mistylaw Muir and runs through an attractive Glen nearby with a small reservoir upstream created by Renfrew County Council of old. The Maich Water forms the Local Authority boundary here and harbours a geocache upon its course before it empties into Kilbirnie Loch. The Smuggler's Cave is on the side of the Maich Water, formerly reached through an entrance guarded by sandstone pillars off the driveway. An impressive main entrance off the road from Ford Cottage sets the stage for the rural and aristocratic nature of Ladyland. The 'Sheep Linn' is situated on the Maich Water above Cockston Farm.
Maich Water and Ladyland Moor.
The Scottish Wildlife Trust have designated these areas as part of a Provisional Wildlife Site under the title 'Glengarnock and surrounding uplands'. The following plants are rare species found here — Whorled Caraway ("Carum carvi"), Fragrant Orchid ("Gymnadenia conopsea"), Aspen ("Populus tremulans"), Ivy-leaved Crowfoot ("Ranunculus hederaceus L." ), Dovedale Moss or Mossy Saxifrage ("Saxifraga hypnoides"), Hairy Stonecrop ("Sedum villosum"), Wilson's Filmy Fern ("Hymenophyllum wilsonii"), Bay Willow ("Salix pentandra"), Beech Fern ("Phegopteris connectilis"), Oak Fern ("Gymnocarpium dryopteris") and Mountain Pansy ("Viola lutea").
The Legend of the Green Lady.
The Smuggler's Glen of the Maich Water near Ladyland is said to be the haunt of the ghost of a Green Lady, wearing an emerald dress and said to rise from the depths and glide across the dark waters of the deep pool at the foot of the main waterfall. The Green Lady may be linked with pagan beliefs or she could possibly be linked to 'Our Lady', the Virgin Mary, who is said to have been venerated at a chapel nearby, hence the name of 'Lady land'. It is also said that the Green Lady was the ghost of a beautiful girl drowned in the Smuggler's Glen by a rejected suitor. Another story says the girl was a young gipsy slain by an aristocrat who made her pregnant then killed her to protect his social standing in the community; a final tale records that the girl was herself cheated by a sweetheart and broken-hearted, leapt into the pool at the Smuggler's Glen and drowned.
Paisley poet Robert Tannahill knew of the legend of the Green Lady and wrote a ballad about two sweethearts named Connel and Flora who had regular sylvan trysts in the Smuggler's Glen.
The De'il's Chuckie Stane, the Cat Craig and archaeological finds.
Near the Ladyland Burn beneath a copse of trees to the side of the mansion house is the 'De'il's Chuckie Stane' as indicated on old maps. It has survived being broken up and does not seem to be a glacial erratic, unlike many other obvious 'erratic' stones that have become linked to local folklore traditions. No surviving local legends have explained its evocative name. Chuckie's are pebbles, often made of quartz, a white stone, which this stone is not. Its significance most likely links with an emphasis on the implied giant stature of the De'il if this is his 'chuckie stane'.
The Cat Craig is located beside the lane running up to Cockston farm and is one of two drystone wall enclosed crags. The name 'Cat' is applied to many stones, such as the 'Cat Stone' on the Isle of Arran near the village of Corrie and the Cat Stane near Edinburgh Airport. 'Cat' is thought to come from 'Cath', a Celtic word, meaning a 'battle.' The Norwegian term, 'Bauta Stein', means the same thing. The first edition of the OS 6 inch maps shows a 'Castle Hill' in line with Cockston Farm on the other side of the Maich Water and this may make the meaning of the name 'Cat Craig' more plausible. Cockston Farm and sheep fauld date from at least 1827.
About 1810, Mr. Cochran of Ladyland removed a stone cairn near Ladyland above the Ford farmhouse during agricultural improvements; an urn with burnt bones was found in the centre of it. At Ladyland itself a small bronze axe was dug up. It measures 5 3/8 inches by 3 inches wide. This axe is a Coles' type I, found at NS 322 578; it was donated to the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland (NMAS) in 1886 by R W Cochran-Patrick (Accession no: DC 53). It has slight flanges and a stop ridge.
On the hills above Ladyland are the signs left by ancient cultivation of the land at a time when the climate was more appropriate for growing crops in these elevated situations. These cultivation marks were difficult to explain in times past and they were referred to as 'Elf furrows'.
Micro-history.
Captain William Hamilton had been a privateer during the second Dutch War and following the flight of King James II he was the captain of a cruiser fighting on the side of William and Mary. He was killed in 1689 aboard his ship when engaged in an action against French ships off Ireland who were engaged in transporting Jacobite troops to Mull.
The ancestors of the Cochran-Patricks lived originally at Edge whose ruins still stand on the hillside overlooking the road to Muirshiel Country Park, just beyond Clovenstone Cottage.
Aiton in 1811 records that J. Cochrane Esq experimented with improving coarse hill pastures by diverting a "mountain rill" to run over it the site and as a consequence the pasture greatly improved, enough to yield a good crop of hay. His neighbours had scorned the expense of enclosing the land with a dyke, however he proved them wrong.
On the summit of Little Auchenbourach hill, above Calder glen, is a cairn of stones surrounded by metal railings. A plaque on this cairn commemorated William Arthur Cochran-Patrick, son of R W Cochran-Patrick, who was born on June 12, 1860, and died on January 29, 1881 aged 20 of tetanus whilst studying at Cambridge University. A Latin inscription translates as 'You were loved by all.' The Cochran-Patricks of Ladyland owned Auchenbourach Hill. The monument was financed by William's friends and the tenants of Ladyland.
Eleanora Cochran-Patrick, a daughter of RW Cochran-Patrick married Sir Neil James Kennedy, however he took his wife's surnames to preserve the ancient family patronym.
In June 1911 the Misses Cochrane-Patrick of Ladyland House were driving home in their waggonette from the Kerse Mission on a Sunday night; the horse shied at a dog on the roadside and fell, overturning the machine at the same time. Miss Harriet Cochrane-Patrick who was driving was thrown to the ground and a wheel of the waggonette passed over her right shoulder while her sister, Miss Cochrane-Patrick was pinned to the ground by the overturned machine lying on her breast. The coachman, William Benson, jumped from the back seat and held the horse down till the ladies were extricated by some people who witnessed the accident. Benson had his right hand severely injured.
The horse was badly hurt and the waggonette smashed. Mr Simpson of Langslie Farm, conveyed the ladies home in his machine and they were afterwards attended by Dr Milroy and Nurse Cooper. Miss Cochrane-Patrick was almost unconscious from bruises and shock and Miss Harriet Cochrane-Patrick was also bruised, but fortunately no bones were broken. Both ladies were very popular for their charitable work in the Kilbirnie and Beith districts.

Jamaan Al-Harbash is a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, representing the second district. Born in 1970, Al-Harbash obtained a PhD in Islamic ideology and worked as a professor at Kuwait University before being elected to the National Assembly in 2006. While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Al-Harbash affiliates with the Islamist Hadas party.
Against Falcon Smuggling.
on April 17, 2007, Al-Harbash and other MPs submitted documents to parliament claiming that several falcon shipments for "influential people" had been imported recently without proper testing. Kuwat banned bird imports as an avian influenza precaution, but the ban was eased since July 2006. Al-Harbash sees the smuggling as an example of corruption that puts the country at risk for bird flu: "Lifting the ban on falcons was a catastrophe. Why were they exempted from the ban despite warnings by doctors?" Al-Harbash says he will ask the parliament's health committee to study the situation and report back.
Kuwait reported 20 birds, including 18 falcons, were tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu on February 25 and so far the bird flu cases have reached to 132. In November 2005, Kuwait detected the first case of a bird infected with the H5N1 strain—a flamingo at a seaside villa.
Pro-Hijab Walkout.
On June 1, 2008, Al-Harbash, Waleed AlـTabtabaie, Mohammed Hayef AlـMutairi, and six other MPs walked out of the swearing in ceremony of Modhi al-Homoud and Nouria al-Subeih, two new female Cabinet ministers who were not wearing headscarves.
Protested Against Israeli Attacks.
On December 28, 2008, Kuwaiti lawmakers Mikhled Al-Azmi, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq Al-Ghanim, Jaaman Al-Harbash, Ahmad Al-Mulaifi, Mohammad Hayef Al-Mutairi, Ahmad Al-Saadoun, Nasser Al-Sane, and Waleed Al-Tabtabaie protested in front of the National Assembly building against the attacks by Israel on Gaza. Protesters burned Israeli flags, waved banners reading, "No to hunger, no to submission" and chanted "Allahu Akbar". Israel launched air strikes against Hamas in the Gaza Strip on December 26 after a six-month ceasefire ended on December 18.

Global Network Initiative

The Global Network Initiative (GNI) is a non-governmental organization with the dual goals of preventing Internet censorship by authoritarian governments and protecting the Internet privacy rights of individuals. It is sponsored by a coalition of multinational corporations, non-profit organizations, and universities.
History.
On October 29, 2008, the Global Network Initiative (GNI) was founded upon its "Principles of Freedom of Expression and Privacy". The Initiative was launched in the 60th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights on freedom of expression and privacy set out in the UDHR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).
Profile.
As a human rights organization, GNI seeks to safeguard freedom of expression and personal privacy against government restrictions. The protections are facilitated by a coalition of companies, investors, civil society organizations, academics, and other stakeholders.
GNI esteems freedom of expression and privacy each as a “human right and guarantor of human dignity”. Participants are expected to respect and protect information available to users and users’ ability to freely create and distribute information, provided that they operate outside narrowly defined circumstances necessary to adhere to international laws and standards set by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
Participants are also expected to protect users’ personal information from illegal or arbitrary interference when confronted with government demands, laws, or regulations that compromise a user’s privacy. The same principle of adherence of international laws and standards applies.
Collaboration among stakeholders is key to the goals of the Global Network Initiative. The GNI's outline of principles encourages participants to explore ways to engage governments advance their cause, individually or collectively.
GNI recognizes that the actions of their corporate participants alone cannot guarantee the protection of human rights. One fundamental commitment is to promote the adoption of laws, policies, and practices that protect freedom of expression and privacy. GNI considers governments to be ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of their citizens' human rights, specifically pursuant to freedom of expression and privacy.
Participants.
The Global Network Initiative requires participating companies to integrate their principles deeply into their decision-making and culture. The GNI struggles to get large corporate participants other than the initial three, Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft. Facebook and Twitter are valuable for their large audiences and wide use by activists in the Middle East and other volatile regions. The reasons they will not join remain vague from spokespersons or entirely unspecified, but factors like the toughness of the independent auditing process or the lack of financial benefit may engender corporate reluctance.

Rush Historic District

The Rush Historic District is a zinc mining region of the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas. Now located within Buffalo National River, the district includes ruins dating from 1880 to 1940. The area was an important part of what became known as the North Arkansas Lead and Zinc District, and played a role in the development of railroads and modern infrastructure in the area.
During World War I the Rush Creek mines were the center of the zinc industry in Arkansas. Ten mining companies operated 13 developed mines within the district, more than in any other mining district within the North Arkansas District.
The buildings, structures, and ruins at Rush are the last visible remains of historic zinc mining activity in Arkansas. Of the other mining districts which once stretched across northern Arkansas, only limited debris now marks those sites. Rush is the only area left to retain not only the mines, but also buildings, structures, and ruins pertaining to mining and community life. The Rush Historic District exists today within the same environment and setting as it did during its periods of historic significance. Nearly as isolated today as it was historically, it has been little touched by time. The ghost town, mines, and waste piles visible on the bluffs immediately set the flavor of the district as an abandoned mountain mining community. The buildings, structures, ruins, and sites in the district exist in the same relationships as they did during the mining era.

Ukraine men's national junior ice hockey team

The Ukrainian men's national junior ice hockey team is the national under-20 ice hockey team in Ukraine. The team represents Ukraine at the International Ice Hockey Federation's World Junior Hockey Championship Division I.
History.
Ukraine made its first appearance at the top level in 1994, less than five years after gaining independence from the Soviet Union. Ukraine went on to upset the United States, and Ukrainian goaltender Igor Karpenko went on to win top goaltender at the 1995 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Since, there was no relegation round due to the restructuring of the format, Ukraine was no relegated, despite finishing 8th out of 8 teams. Ukraine was relegated to Pool B after finishing 10th in 1996. Four years later, Ukraine made it back to Pool A in 2000, and once again finished 10th. Despite, the relegation, Ukraine didn't lose a game by more than 7 goals. Ukraine earned promotion to top level for 2004 with a one-point differential over Japan, by defeating France 3-0 on the last day. Ukraine experienced troubles in Helsinki, Finland with equipment shortages (ea-sticks, tape), because the country was experiencing economic difficulties. Other teams participating donated sticks, tape, skate laces, and other pieces of equipment to the Ukrainian team. Despite, the generous donations from other teams, Ukraine did not hold up well in the tournament losing to the Czech-Republic (8-0); Switzerland (11-0; Canada (10-0); Finland (14-1). Ukraine went on to lose the relegation round to Sweden (4-0), and tie Austria (2-2). Ukraine has remained at the Division I level since then.

LNWR Class A

The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Class A was a class of 0-8-0 steam locomotives. From 1893 to 1900, Crewe Works built 111 of these engines, which had a three-cylinder compound arrangement, and were designed by Francis Webb. According to the LNWR Society, 110 were built between 1894 and 1900.
Rebuilding.
Like the other Webb compounds, they proved problematic, so in 1904 George Whale began rebuilding these to simple expansion engines. Fifteen were converted to Class C between 1904–1906, 62 to Class D between 1906–1909, with the remaining 34 rebuilt by Charles Bowen Cooke to Class C1 between 1909-1912.
Classification.
The LNWR letter classification system for 8 coupled engines (A, B, C, etc.) was introduced in 1911.

On February 8, 2008, Al-Ghanim, as head of the Youth and Sports Committee, agreed reform the Kuwaiti football program in line with the recommendations of FIFA. In November 2007, FIFA had suspended Kuwait from all international matches because of governmental interference in the national football program. The dispute originated with Kuwait's October 9 elections for key posts in the country's soccer federation. FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) refused to recognise the polls.

<doc id="20489684" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20489684" title="Philharmonia Chorus">
Philharmonia Chorus

The Philharmonia Chorus is an independent self-governing symphony chorus based in London, UK. The Chorus Master is Stefan Bevier.
Foundation.
The Philharmonia Chorus was founded in 1957 by Walter Legge as a choral counterpart to the Philharmonia Orchestra which he had founded twelve years earlier. The Chorus’s first concert, a performance on 12 November 1957 of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, completed a cycle of Beethoven symphonies in London’s Royal Festival Hall with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Otto Klemperer, and was recorded shortly afterwards with the same performers.
To create his chorus, Legge turned to Wilhelm Pitz, then chorus master of the Bayreuth Festival. Between the first rehearsal in February 1957 and first concert there was a long period of preparation during which Pitz rehearsed the Chorus in not only the scheduled Beethoven but also in choral passages from Wagner’s "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg". From that preparatory work emerged a chorus unique for its blend of British choral tradition and German musical training and discipline, and for a dramatic quality found more typically in opera than in a symphony chorus. The full yet homogeneous and professionally disciplined sound immediately attracted critical notice.
Early years.
Under Legge’s management and Pitz’s training the Chorus worked with many of the most distinguished conductors of the time: Wolfgang Sawallisch, Sir Thomas Beecham, Carlo Maria Giulini (a particularly close relationship), Herbert von Karajan, Leopold Stokowski, Sir John Barbirolli and Sir Adrian Boult. Benchmark recordings of the Maria Callas/Tullio Serafin "Lucia di Lammermoor", Sir William Walton conducting his own "Belshazzar's Feast", Klemperer’s Brahms "Ein deutsches Requiem", Beethoven’s "Fidelio" and Mahler’s Second Symphony, and Giulini’s Verdi "Requiem" and "Quattro Pezzi Sacri" won particular acclaim. Tours followed to the Edinburgh Festival, to Lucerne, and with Giulini to Parma where the audience in the Teatro Regio paid it the remarkable compliment of showering carnations on this British chorus singing Verdi to Italians.
Self-governance.
When Legge relinquished management in 1964, the re-formed New Philharmonia Chorus became a self-governing body independent of the Philharmonia Orchestra with a Council of Management of twelve Directors elected by the members, a system of governance which remains in place today. The first concert of both New Philharmonia Orchestra and New Philharmonia Chorus took place on 27 October 1964, a performance of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony again conducted by Klemperer. In succeeding years the Chorus performed and recorded works with further renowned conductors: Lorin Maazel, George Szell, Daniel Barenboim and Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos (notable recordings of Mendelssohn’s "Elijah", Orff’s "Carmina Burana" and Haydn's "Die Schöpfung"), and further collaborations with Walton, Benjamin Britten conducting his "Spring Symphony", and a landmark performance, later released on LP and then CD, and of Britten’s "War Requiem" conducted by Giulini, with Britten himself conducting the chamber ensemble.
On his retirement in 1971, Wilhelm Pitz was succeeded as Chorus Master by Walter Hagen-Groll (from the Deutsche Oper of West Berlin), in 1975 by Norbert Balatsch (chorus master of both Vienna Staatsoper and Bayreuth Festival), in 1980 by Heinz Mende (former chorus master of the Chor des Bayerischen Rundfunks in Munich), and then in 1984 by Horst Neumann (chorus master of the Rundfunkchor Leipzig).
Re-instatement of the original name.
On 1 September 1977 the Chorus was able to take back its former name, Philharmonia Chorus, and later the same month gave two performances of Mahler’s Eighth Symphony in Belgium with the similarly reinstated Philharmonia Orchestra under Michael Tilson Thomas.
These years saw the Chorus tour widely throughout Europe: several staged operas in the Roman Théâtre Antique d’Orange, Haydn’s "Die Schöpfung" in Paris and London to celebrate the UK’s entry into the EEC in 1973, Handel’s "Judas Maccabeus" with Sir Charles Mackerras at Teatro alla Scala Milan in 1980 followed a few years later by a second appearance at La Scala in Bach’s B minor Mass under Giulini. A 1979 recording of Mozart’s "Requiem" with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Giulini won the 1981 Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance.
In the UK there were engagements with Riccardo Muti, Sir Georg Solti, Lovro von Matačić, Giuseppe Sinopoli (appointed Principal Conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1984 and with whom the Chorus appeared in Parma and Taormina), Kurt Sanderling (including the Chorus' second recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony), Sir Andrew Davis, Seiji Ozawa, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Bernard Haitink, Charles Dutoit, and in 1980 the Chorus's first appearance at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in a performance of Verdi’s "Requiem" at the Rudolf Kempe Memorial Concert. A second appearance in the same House six years later in Britten’s "War Requiem" with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Simon Rattle was a Memorial Concert for Sir Peter Pears. These years also saw the Chorus appearing regularly in the UK outside London with notable visits to Cardiff, Brighton, Nottingham, Derby, Cheltenham, Cambridge and Aldeburgh. At Aldeburgh the Chorus gave the world première in 1985 of Britten's unfinished final composition Praise We Great Men, with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Mstislav Rostropovich, and three years later took part in a semi-staged performance of Britten's "Paul Bunyan." Two years later in 1988 a particular honour was paid the Chorus: an invitation to perform in Mahler’s Eighth Symphony in Amsterdam’s Concertgebouw to mark the 100th Anniversary of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and concert hall, the hall’s re-opening after renovations, and Bernard Haitink’s last concerts as chief conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra.
New horizons.
In 1992 David Hill became Chorus Master and Artistic Director. Director of Music at Westminster Cathedral and later at Winchester Cathedral, he was the first Briton to hold the post. He was succeeded by Robert Dean, formerly Head of Music at Scottish Opera and Professor of Singing at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, in 1998. In these years the Chorus performed Rachmaninov’s Vespers in Westminster and Winchester Cathedrals and recorded it, accompanied Luciano Pavarotti “in the Park” and at Leeds Castle, remixed Beatles numbers, and performed before HM The Queen for the 50th Anniversary of VE Day. At London's Royal Festival Hall, its traditional home, the Chorus appeared regularly with Claus Peter Flor and the Philharmonia Orchestra's then Principal Guest Conductor, Leonard Slatkin.
In December 1997 the Chorus celebrated its 40th Birthday with its patron HRH The Prince of Wales in attendance at a Gala performance of Verdi’s Requiem with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by James Levine, followed three days later by a performance of Mahler’s Eighth Symphony with the same conductor. During this period the Chorus performed for the first time with Valery Gergiev and Sir Mark Elder. Several European tours of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony followed with Guilini and the European Community Youth Orchestra, with Sir Yehudi Menuhin and the Sinfonia Varsovia, and in December 1999 with Sir Simon Rattle and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, culminating in a Millennium Concert broadcast by BBC Television from Ely Cathedral. Other overseas tours took place to Strasbourg, the first visit to the US (to Baltimore), and in 2000 the Chorus was invited to perform in the Vatican's Paul VI Audience Hall for Pope John Paul II on his 80th birthday. In autumn 2002 the Chorus joined the orchestra and chorus of Norddeutscher Rundfunk and the BBC Singers in the presence of the President of Germany Johannes Rau and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for a concert of reconciliation, Britten’s "War Requiem" conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, performed in the Turbine Hall of the former Nazi rocket development factory in Peenemünde, north Germany.
In 2004, following a semi-staged concert performance of Weber’s Der Freischütz at the Edinburgh Festival the previous year, Sir Charles Mackerras agreed to become the Chorus’s first President, which post he held with distinction until his death in 2010. The 50th anniversary was celebrated in June 2007 with a performance of Verdi’s "Requiem" with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti in the presence of its Patron HRH The Prince of Wales. In Autumn 2008 Edward Caswell became Artistic Director, training the Chorus for a performance of Bernstein’s Kaddish Symphony in London’s Barbican Centre conducted by John Axelrod in a concert to mark the 70th Anniversary of Kristallnacht.
Recent developments.
In April 2010 the Philharmonia Chorus returned to its tradition of German musical training with the appointment as Chorus Master of Stefan Bevier, a former player with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, a singer and conductor. 
Earlier the same year was launched the Philharmonia Chorus Professional Singers Scheme, through which specially auditioned professional singers in the early years of their careers join the Chorus as members. The first concert to include members of the Scheme took place in February 2010 in London’s Royal Festival Hall, a performance of Mahler’s Second Symphony with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Eliahu Inbal. Performances since have included the UK première of Jeajoon Ryu’s "Sinfonia da Requiem"(Royal Philharmonic Orchestra/Nowak), Beethoven Ninth Symphony (Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment/Volkov and Philharmonia Orchestra/Salonen), Beethoven's "Missa Solemnis" (Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment/Noseda), Brahms' "Ein deutsches Requiem" (Philharmonia Orchestra/Dohnányi), and Britten's "War Requiem" and Mahler's Second and Eighth Symphonies (Philharmonia Orchestra/Maazel). The Chorus’s several appearances at the “Easter at King’s” Festival, conducted by Stephen Cleobury and broadcast by BBC Radio from King’s College Cambridge, have included James MacMillan’s recently composed "Passion According to St John" in the presence of the composer, and Frank Martin’s "Golgotha" in the presence of the composer’s widow. 
In 2012 the Chorus returned to continental Europe, performing Berlioz’s "Grande Messe des Morts" with the Orchestre National de Lyon under Leonard Slatkin both in the Auditorium de Lyon and at the Berlioz Festival in the composer’s birthplace of La Côte-St-André. The Chorus also opened Hamburger Symphoniker’s 2012-13 season with a performance of Elgar’s "The Dream of Gerontius" conducted by Jeffrey Tate, a former member of the Chorus, following which he agreed to become the Chorus’s President.

1923–24 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

1923–24 Huddersfield Town F.C. season saw Town become the champions of English football. They beat Welsh side Cardiff City to the title by goal average.
Review.
After finishing 3rd the previous season and winning the FA Cup the season before, some thought that a championship under Herbert Chapman wasn't impossible. The season would see Town reach the pinnacle of football excellence and win the 1st Division.
This was done with Town only having 5 different scorers all season; George Brown with 8, George Cook with 9, Clem Stephenson with 11, Billy Smith with 13 and Charlie Wilson top-scoring with 18 league goals. (Billy Johnston did score an FA Cup goal). The title went down to the last match and Town's 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest giving Town their title by goal average.

Tod Brynan

Charles Ruley "Tod" Brynan (July 1863 – May 10, 1925) was a right-handed pitcher/outfielder in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Stockings (later the Cubs) and Boston Beaneaters (now the Atlanta Braves).
Brynan debuted with the White Stockings on June 22, 1888 against the Pittsburg Alleghenys. He pitched in three games that season, completing two, on his way to posting a record of 2–1 with an inflated 6.48 ERA. He also made one appearance in left field during his tenure with the Stockings. At the plate that season, he hit .182 with a triple and an RBI in 11 trips to the plate.
Brynan would not resurface until May 26, 1891, pitching for the Beaneaters. He started that game on the mound but did not last long, getting pulled after a disastrous first inning in which he allowed six earned runs on four hits and three walks for an unfortunate ERA of 54.00.
He also played in the minors in the Southern Association in 1886, Northwestern League in 1887, Western Association from 1888 to 1889 and Michigan State League in 1889.

Musallam Al-Barrak

Musallam Al-Barrak () was a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, representing the fourth district. Born in January 30, 1956, Al-Barrak studied Arab literature and worked in the Municipal Council before being elected to the National Assembly in 1996. While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Al-Barrak affiliates with the Popular Action Bloc. 
As of 2012, Al-Barrak had been elected for six consecutive terms, making him the longest-serving member of parliament. In the February 2012 parliamentary election, Al-Barrak set a national record for the most votes received.
In 2011 and 2012, Al-Barrak played a leading role in popular protests calling for political reform. In April 2012, he was stripped of his parliamentary immunity by the National Assembly for participating in the storming of the parliament building by protesters. In October 2012, Al-Barrak made a speech in which he broke with Kuwaiti precedent by criticizing the Emir Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah directly. He was arrested on 29 October for "undermining the status of the emir" and released on bail four days later. On 15 April, he was sentenced to five years in prison.
Parliamentary career.
Al-Barrak was a member of the opposition parliamentary group Popular Action Bloc. In the 2006 parliamentary election, he won re-election with over 8,000 votes, the highest total in the election and an all-time record.
In May 2003, Al-Barrak spoke against visiting Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri, criticizing him for opposing the US-led invasion of Iraq. Holding an egg, he said: "This is what you are worth Hariri... a rotten egg from the Kuwaiti people".
Along with other Popular Action Bloc MPs, he criticized the government's Project Kuwait, which proposed international development of northern oil fields; Al-Barrak stated that they should be developed by a Kuwaiti company.
In 2006, he and fellow MP Ahmad Al-Saadoun questioned the government's cancellation of several contracts, and began meeting with the Audit Bureau. 
Also in 2006, he and Mohammed Al-Sager led opposition to Minister of Information Mohammed Al-Sanousi's re-appointment, due to the limits they said he had placed on freedom of the press. Al-Sanousi resigned on 17 December 2006, one day before he was due to be grilled by parliament. Al-Barrak suggested Al-Sanousi had been forced to quit, calling it "a victory for the constitution, democracy and freedom". 
2007–2011.
On June 25, 2007, Al-Barrak, Abdullah Al-Roumi, and Adel Al-Saraawi accused Oil Minister Sheik Ali Al Jarrah Al-Sabah of using his influence when he was chief executive officer of Kuwait's Burgan Bank to open accounts at the request of his cousin, in the names of paper companies so that they could be used for siphoning the stolen money. Minister Al-Sabah, a member of the royal family, resigned before a vote of no-confidence could be held against him. Transportation Minister Sharedah Al-Mawashergi resigned in solidarity with the Oil Minister. On 8 January 2008, Al-Barrak was one of ten MPs to file a no-confidence motion in Education Minister Nouria Al-Subeih, then Kuwait's only female politician. Al-Subeih was accused of misleading the public in denying an incident in which three boys had been molested by a foreign worker; she stated she had been misinformed and apologized.
Al-Barrak was elected again in 2009, and was elected by Parliament to serve on the Parliamentary Committee for Public Facilities. In December of that year, he participated in the grilling and criticism of Interior Minister Jaber Al-Khaled Al-Sabah, alleging financial irregularities in a deal over billboards. Following Al-Barrak's criticism, ten MPs filed a motion of no-confidence in the minister.
Public prosecutors requested in July 2010 that the National Assembly strip Al-Barrak of his parliamentary immunity so that he could face charges of harming the national security, but the request was refused. In December 2010, the television station Al Jazeera was shut down in Kuwait after refusing to censor a broadcast of a telephone interview with Al-Barrak. Following the incident, Al-Barrak, Jamaan Al-Harbash and Saleh Al-Mulla called for Prime Minister Nasser Al-Mohammad Al-Sabah to be grilled before parliament. On December 29, Al-Barrak and nine others filed a motion of no-confidence against the PM. 
In August 2011, following reports that some MPs had received millions of dinars to their accounts, Al-Barrak called for the governor of the Central Bank of Kuwait to resign. In November, he participated in the storming of the parliament by protesters calling for Nasser Al Mohammad Al Sabah's resignation for corruption charges. He told reporters, "We are now waiting for the dissolution of government and the parliament ... Until this happens, Wednesday was only the first step among many. We don't fear anything except God."
Loss of immunity and arrest.
In April 2012, the Public Prosecutor requested that the National Assembly strip Al-Barrak of his parliamentary immunity for his role in the November 2011 storming of the parliament. On April 24, the Assembly voted in favor of removing Al-Barrak's immunity, as well as that of eight other MPs. 
On 20 June, the Constitutional Court ruled the February 2012 parliamentary elections unconstitutional, dissolving the new parliament in favor of the previous. Al-Barrak assailed the decision, calling it a "blatant attack on the choice of the people" and "a coup against the constitution".
On 15 October, Al-Barrak spoke in front of a crowd of thousands of protesters in front of the parliament building. Al-Barrak criticized Emir Sabah Al-Sabah, stating, "We will not allow you, your highness, to take Kuwait into the abyss of autocracy… We no longer fear your prisons and your baton sticks". Riot police broke up the protest, arresting a number of people, and the public prosecutor filed charges against Al-Barrak. 
Al-Barrak was arrested on 29 October for charges of "undermining the status of the emir". On 1 November, thousands of people marched to the prison to protest his arrest. After the crowd refused an order to disperse, police fired smoke bombs and tear gas to break up the protest. Amnesty International issued a statement on Al-Barrak's behalf, stating that he had been detained "purely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression" and calling for the charges against him to be dropped.
After four days of detention, Al-Barrak was released on bail after reportedly paying more than US$35,500. During his trial, his defense attorneys walked out in protest after being barred by the judge from calling witnesses including the Kuwaiti prime minister.
On 15 April 2013, Al-Barrak was sentenced to five years in jail for his critical comments about the Emir. Thousands of people took to the streets in protest of the verdict. A lawyer for Al-Barrak stated that "the ruling is null and void because it violated the legal procedures and for failing to provide the defence team with sufficient guarantees". The Kuwaiti Ministry of Information released its own statement saying that "Kuwait has a transparent and independent judicial system ... All citizens, regardless of their position, are equal in the eyes of the law. Anyone accused of a crime in Kuwait will get a fair trial with a comprehensive legal defense and open appeals process." The government also began consideration of a law to make insulting the royal family punishable by a roughly $1 million fine.

Tramp bike

A tramp bike is a specifically converted BMX bike that can be used on a trampoline. In most cases the bike will have everything removed leaving only the frame, fork, seat and handlebars. This means that the wheels, chain, pedals, cranks, and bearings of a conventional bike are not required. Padding is wrapped and secured with tape around anything sharp that is likely to damage the trampoline. The bike is used to practice difficult tricks as performed during freestyle BMX and freestyle motocross.
It is a safe and affordable way to learn how to do bike tricks. There is little chance of damage to the trampoline if the bike is covered; accordingly a net/mesh cage is strongly recommended for safety.

Later career.
Staladi originally signed for the Warrington Wolves for the 1999 Super League season. However because he had only played eleven games for the Warriors this was not enough to secure a work permit and he could not join the Warrington squad. Staladi then signed for the South Sydney Rabbitohs for the 2000 season, only for them to be excluded from the National Rugby League. After contemplating giving the game away Staladi returned to the Mt Albert Lions who entered the new Bartercard Cup competition in 2000.

LNWR Class B

The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Class B was a class of 0-8-0 steam locomotives introduced in 1901. A development of the three-cylinder compound Class A (though this letter classification was not introduced until 1911), they had a 4-cylinder compound arrangement. 170 were built between 1901-1904.
Rebuilds.
Between 1904 and 1908, Webb's successor George Whale added a leading pony truck to 26 engines, making them 2-8-0s and taking them into Class E (again from 1911).
Between 1906 and 1908, Whale also rebuilt 10 with larger Experiment-type boiler to Class F, again adding a leading pony truck. (Two more of Class B were also converted to Class F "via" Class E).
Neither of the above conversions was particularly successful and, as a result, 32 were rebuilt to Class G with 2-cylinder simple expansion between 1910 and 1917.
Whale's Successor Charles Bowen Cooke rebuilt a further 91 direct from Class B to 2-cylinder simple superheated LNWR Class G1 (also known as "Super Ds"). The rebuilds from Class B to Class G1 continued under LMS ownership between 1923 and 1927.
A total of 170 locomotives was built but No. 134 was destroyed in a boiler explosion at Buxton on 11 November 1921 leaving 169. The rebuilds (some under LMS ownership) totalled 159, leaving 10 unrebuilt.
LMS ownership.
The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) inherited 53 unrebuilt Class B locomotives in 1923 and numbered them 8900-8952. The LMS continued to rebuild them to Class G1 and the number of unrebuilt locomotives dwindled to 10.
Withdrawal.
The remaining 10 Class B locomotives were withdrawn in 1927-1928. None were preserved.

Nasser Al-Sane

Nasser Al-Sane is a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, representing the third district. Born in 1955, Al-Sane obtained a PhD in Business Administration before being elected to the National Assembly in 1992. While political parties are illegal in Kuwait, Al-Sane affiliates with the Islamist Hadas party.
Opposes Project Kuwait.
Project Kuwait is a $7 billion, 25-year plan, first formulated in 1997 by the SPC, to increase the country's oil production (and to help compensate for declines at the mature Burgan field), with the help of international oil companies. In particular, Kuwait aims to increase output at five northern oil fields (Abdali, Bahra, Ratqa, Raudhatain, and Sabriya) from their current rate of around to within three years. 
Al-Sane opposes Project Kuwait and allowing foreign oil companies into Kuwait. On December 23, 2005, Al-Sane told the press that he opposed the entry of these foreign companies because it is barred by the constitution: "The step the government wants to take is against the law, and we have to stand against it strongly... The constitutional issue is the main one. We're not against foreign investments, but the problem is that you have to stick to the constitution."
Wary of Ministry Purging.
In May 2007, Al-Sane, chairman of the parliamentary subcommittee for Employment and Administrative Reforms, urged Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah “to intervene and stop some ministers from ousting senior and highly experienced employees from the ministries.” Al-Sane argued that, “some ministers are forcing senior employees who have gained valuable experience in their respective fields to take retirement without even consulting them... This practice will prove harmful in the long run as employees with very little experience are being appointed at senior positions.” Al-Sane drafted a bill to address the issue, which he believes could be devises between the cabinet and the parliament: "If the Prime Minister does not take quick measures to end this practice, it will sour the relations between the government and parliament." 
Defense of Oil Minister Al-Olaim.
In July 2007, several Popular Action Bloc MPs alleged that Oil Minister Mohammad Al-Olaim's bidding process for the refinery at Al-Zour was flawed. The MPs claimed that the awarding of the contracts was not made under the country's Tenders Law which governs all major public contracts. The MPs also threatened to grill Al-Olaim if he signed the contracts and demanded that the project be scrutinized by the Audit Bureau to make sure that it did not involve squandering of public funds. After initially rejecting the calls, the minister later bowed to pressure and agreed to ask the cabinet to refer the project to the Bureau.
Al-Sane strongly defended Olaim and alleged that vested interests were behind the attacks on the minister. Al-Olaim was a leading member of the Hadas party to which Al-Sane belongs.
Protested Against Israeli Attacks.
On December 28, 2008, Kuwaiti lawmakers Mikhled Al-Azmi, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq Al-Ghanim, Jaaman Al-Harbash, Ahmad Al-Mulaifi, Mohammad Hayef Al-Mutairi, Ahmad Al-Saadoun, Nasser Al-Sane, and Waleed Al-Tabtabaie protested in front of the National Assembly building against the attacks by Israel on Gaza. Protesters burned Israeli flags, waved banners reading, "No to hunger, no to submission" and chanted "Allahu Akbar". Israel launched air strikes against Hamas in the Gaza Strip on December 26 after a six-month ceasefire ended on December 18.

In 360 he was "tribunus et notarius". Emperor Constantius II sent Decentius to Caesar Julian to ask for his best troops, the Heruli, the Batavi, the Celtae and the Petulantes, as well as three hundred picked men from other corps. The troops were not happy with this order, as they did not want to leave their country and their families to go East, but Decentius took some of the most vigorous me and started marching. He also suggested Julian to have the troops pass through Paris, where the Caesar had his quarters. This is an important detail, as when in Paris, the troops acclaimed Julian emperor against Constantius. He then returned to Constantius.

Hasdrubal I of Carthage

Hasdrubal I of Carthage was the Magonid king of Ancient Carthage, in present day Tunisia, from 530 to 510 BCE.
Rule.
In the mid 520's, Hasdrubal, along with his brother Hamilcar I, launched an expedition against Sardinia.
Hasdrubal was elected as "King" eleven times, was granted a triumph four times (the only Carthaginian to receive this honor - there is no record of anyone else being given similar treatment by Carthage) and had died of his battle wounds received in Sardinia. Carthage had engaged in a 25 year struggle in Sardinia, where the natives may have received aid from Sybaris, then the richest city in Magna Graecia and an ally of the Phocaeans. The Carthaginians faced resistance from Nora and Sulci in Sardinia, while Carales and Tharros had submitted willingly to Carthaginian rule. Hasdrubal’s war against the Libyans failed to stop the annual tribute payment.
Around this time, the Carthaginians managed to defeat and drive away the colonization attempt near Leptis Magna in Libya by the Spartan prince Dorieus after three years. Dorieus was later defeated and killed at Eryx in Sicily ( around 510 BCE) while attempting to establish a foothold in Western Sicily.

Getzen

The Getzen Company is a family-owned manufacturer and wholesaler of brass instruments. The present product portfolio consists of trumpets, cornets, flugelhorns, trombones and a baritone horn. Four generations of the Getzen family have participated in the company.
History.
Founding.
In 1939, Anthony James (T.J.) Getzen founded the Getzen Company, in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Getzen had trained in instrument repair with the C.G. Conn company and worked as a plant superintendent for the Frank Holton Company. Initially opened as a repair shop, the company expanded after WWII to instrument manufacture. In 1946, Getzen produced its first trombones. In 1947, Getzen started producing trumpets and cornets as well. In 1949, J. Robert Getzen, T.J.'s son, assumed the position of plant superintendent and Getzen started to produce piston bugles. These bugles became popular with Drum and Bugle Corps.
Expansion and sale.
In 1959, J. Robert Getzen left the company to found Allied Music. His brother Donald Getzen briefly assumed the leadership of the company in 1960 and acquired control of the Hoosier Band Instrument Company. Late in 1960, the family sold the company to attorney Harold M. Knowlton. No longer a family-owned business, the company continued to follow the same business model, expanding its visibility through an association with trumpeter Carl “Doc” Severinsen of The Tonight Show fame. In addition to the marketing aspect, this association also produced the Getzen 900 Severinsen Model Eterna trumpet. Producing both student and professional lines, the Getzen company was preparing to expand in October 1963 when the existing facility was destroyed by fire. The new factory opened in February 1964 with only a brief interruption in business. Founder T.J. Getzen died in 1968
Modern family business.
In 1985, Harold Knowlton sold Getzen to Charles F. Andrews and the same year, J. Robert Getzen sold Allied Music to his sons Thomas and Edward. Edward concurrently founded Edwards Trombones. Charles Andrews lost control of the company in bankruptcy in 1991 and the Getzen brothers purchased the firm's assets. Transitioning Allied Music to the original role of the Getzen Company, instrument repair only, the family focused on the Getzen name for brass instrument manufacture with Edwards as a subsidiary. In 1999, Thomas Getzen bought out his brother to become sole owner of the Getzen Company. In 2003 J. Robert Getzen died. In 2009, two of Thomas Getzen's sons were working for the company maintaining the family business model under the leadership of their father.
Products.
The Getzen Company produces a line of trumpets including the professional level Genesis and Artist lines, the beginner level 300 and 400 series, the student line Capri and 700 series, and the more advanced Eterna series. Additionally, the company builds two models of piccolo trumpet (Capri and Eterna), a herald trumpet, bass trumpet and field trumpet.
The company also produces cornets in the 300, 400, Capri, 700, Eterna and Custom series. flugelhorns are available in the Capri, Eterna and Custom series. Trombones are produced in the 300, 400, Capri, 700, Eterna and Custom series. Getzen also builds one model of baritone horn.

Charles E. Anderson (1919–1994) was the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in Meteorology.
Biography.
""'===Higher education and army life===
Anderson was born August 13, 1919, in Clayton, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. His mother and father were from Mississippi. He earned a bachelor of science degree in Chemistry in 1941 from Lincoln University and received high accolades as he graduated third in his class. Lincoln University was also the place where he met his wife-to-be, Marjorie Anderson. Upon graduating, World War II had begun and enlisted in U.S. Army Air Forces.He was assigned to the meteorology division and Anderson claims that this came about due to the process of elimination. The Army sent him, along with 150 other cadets to the University of Chicago to study meteorology. While there along with an exceptionally heavy academic course load, Anderson also underwent physical training, weapons training, and specific training in military intelligence. Anderson completed this training in May 1943 and earned his meteorological certification. Upon finishing, he was stationed in Tuskegee, Alabama where he was assigned as a weather officer for the 332nd Fighter Group now known as the Tuskegee Airmen. After his service in Tuskegee, Anderson became a squadron weather officer and trained fighter pilots across the country.
Post-war career.
Anderson temporarily left the Army Air Corps after the war to pursue an opportunity in high polymer chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1946. After receiving his Master's Degree, Anderson became a research and development officer for Watson Laboratories, supervising the works of many notable German scientists. In 1955, Anderson decided to further pursue his academic studies and applied to the doctoral program in Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During this time he wrote his dissertation: "A Study of the Pulsating Growth of Cumulus Clouds." Anderson earned his Ph.D. in 1960, becoming the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in Meteorology.

Lebanese Army Military Academy

The Lebanese Army Military Academy ( "Al Kulliya al Harbiya") is a part of the Lebanese Armed Forces. The academy is situated at Shikri Ghanem military base, Fayadieh and is attached administratively to the command and administration department. It is one of the oldest military institutions in Lebanon, and was originally founded in Damascus in 1921 under the French mandate.
History.
Following World War I, the French Army organized different army units in the mandated countries. As a result the necessity for national officers, translators and specialists was needed in order to establish departments for these units and then to become preparation for their independence. A Military School was established in Damascus in 1921 to prepare and train officers needed for these new units. In 1932, the Military School was relocated to Homs. The managerial Staff of the School during that period consisted of a school commander (a French Officer), a commander assistant (a Lebanese or Syrian officer) and training officers with their Non-Commissioned Officers’ assistants (Lebanese, Syrian or French). The enrollment and graduation took place during the month of October of every year. The provisos of admission to the military academy back then required an individual to be 18 to 25 years of age, hold a brevet certificate, pass the admissions test and to be a Lebanese or Syrian national or have a Lebanese or Syrian father.
The military school trained cadets for various periods, 3 years for those who were not proficient in French, 2 years for those who were proficient in French and one year for Non-Commissioned Officer’s. At the end of the training period, they graduate and get promoted to lieutenant rank according to a degree. During the graduation ceremony which is often chaired by the Syrian prime minister, the graduating officers are given Platoon commander certificate each in his own specialty (Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineering) and a certificate of competence for the rank of lieutenant. After the graduation, the officers are assigned to different army units where they establish the necessary departments and units in order to train, habilitate and lead. On August 15, 1945, the school barracks were handed over to the Syrian authorities and the Lebanese and French units moved to Lebanon. Instructors and students joined the Kobbeh barracks in Tripoli and they were put administratively under the authority of the third battalion’s company located there. After that, students were given a 15 days leave and joined a camp in Kousba . On September 25, the school moved to St. Anthony convent in Baabda, and settled there for about a year. On the 14th of October 1946, the school moved to Shikri Ghanem base, the buildings consisted of barracks that were used by the British before they left Lebanon and the school remained in this location till now. On December 31, 1951, the Lebanese president Bechara El Khoury inaugurated the school's new buildings.

Our Lady of the Assassins (film)

Our Lady of the Assassins () is a film by Barbet Schroeder about a Colombian author in his fifties who returns to his hometown of Medellín after 30 years of absence to find himself trapped in an atmosphere of violence and murder caused by drug cartel warfare. It is adapted from the novel of the same title by Fernando Vallejo.
</pre>
Synopsis.
Fernando (Germán Jaramillo) meets Alexis (Anderson Ballesteros), a handsome gay youth, at a party of one of his old friends and immediately falls for him. The two begin a relationship which, apart from the sex, consists mainly in Fernando telling Alexis how pastoral the city was when he left, while Alexis explains to Fernando the ins and outs of everyday robbery, violence, and shootings. Even though Fernando has come home to die, his sarcastic worldview is mellowed somewhat by his relationship with Alexis.
He soon discovers that Alexis is a gang member and hitman (or "sicario") himself, and that members of other gangs are after him. After several assassination attempts fail because of Alexis' skillful handling of his Beretta, he is finally killed by two boys on a motorcycle. Fernando is partly responsible for this, as Alexis' weapon has been lost before the murder due to Fernando's suicidal impulses.
Fernando visits Alexis' mother and gives her some money, and then walks through the streets aimlessly when he encounters Wilmar (Juan David Restrepo), who bears a striking resemblance to Alexis, not only in his looks but in his entire manner.
He invites Wilmar for lunch and the two begin an affair, rekindling the kind of relationship he had with Alexis. Wilmar is also a killer, but it is a shocking revelation to Fernando when he finds out that Wilmar is the one who shot Alexis. He vows to kill Wilmar, but then learns it was Alexis who started the violence by killing Wilmar's brother, calling for vengeance on him by Wilmar.
When Wilmar goes to say goodbye to his mother before he and Fernando leave the country together, he is killed as well. Seeing that the vicious cycle of atrocities in Medellín denies happiness, Fernando presumably commits suicide, if the last scene is taken to hint at that.
Film production.
The film was shot with early high-definition video cameras (Sony HDW-700) in the year 2000. The digital video gives the movie a "cinéma vérité" look and was one of the first uses of HD video for a feature film.
At face value, the film can be seen as an indictment of the terrible situation in present-day Medellín—however, the character of Fernando is not unproblematic. While during much of the movie he seems like an innocent bystander to the action, his fascination with all things morbid and moribund shows that to some degree he seeks out and enjoys the violence.
This is also evident in his reactions to the killings done by his lovers, that range from speechlessness to a feeling of almost divine power as time passes. He also does not leave the city despite the clear danger to Alexis' / Wilmar's lives, even though he has inherited enough money to go wherever he wants. Therefore, the film can also be seen as depicting the symbiotic relationship between the author and his subject matter, namely the Medellín gangs.
According to the director, the relationship between Fernando and Alexis is patterned on Greek pederasty, where "not only was a boy learning from an adult, but an adult was also learning from the boy. It's a two-way relationship, especially in this movie, where the writer discovers things about the new realities of his town that he would never know otherwise. And obviously, the boy has everything to discover from this adult."

June 1962 Alcatraz escape

The June 1962 Alcatraz escape was a prison escape attempt by American criminals Clarence Anglin, John Anglin and Frank Morris to leave Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary on Alcatraz Island using an inflatable raft. The FBI's investigation was unable to determine whether the three men successfully escaped or died in the attempt.
Previous attempts.
There were 33 separate total escape attempts by 36 different Alcatraz inmates. Most of the escapees involved were shot by guards or recaptured. The only known successful swim off the island was by John Paul Scott in December, 1962, but he was recaptured on the San Francisco side, at Fort Point, almost immediately.
Inmates.
John and Clarence Anglin.
Anglin brothers Alfred Clarence (born May 11, 1931) and John William (born May 2, 1930) were born in Donalsonville, Georgia, and worked as farmers and laborers. Together they started to rob banks in Georgia and were arrested in 1956. Both were given 15–20 year sentences and sent to Atlanta Penitentiary (where they first met Frank Morris and Allen West), Florida State Prison, and Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. 
Clarence and John made several failed attempts to escape the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary and were consequently sent to Alcatraz. John arrived on October 21, 1960, as Alcatraz inmate AZ1476, and Clarence on January 10, 1961, as inmate AZ1485. 
Frank Morris.
Frank Lee Morris was born in Washington, D.C., on September 1, 1926, and spent most of his early years in foster homes. He was orphaned at age 11 and was convicted of his first crime at the age of 13, and by his late teens had been arrested for crimes ranging from possession of narcotics to armed robbery.
Morris had a long criminal history prior to serving time in Alcatraz. He was sent to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary following one of his arrests, where he first met the Anglin brothers. Frank arrived at Alcatraz on January 3, 1960, where he became prisoner AZ1441.
Allen West.
Allen Clayton West was born on March 25, 1929. He was sent to the Atlanta Penitentiary (where he first met Morris and the Anglin brothers) and Florida State Prison for hijacking as a car thief. He was sent to Alcatraz in 1957, charged with attempting escape, and became prisoner AZ1335.
West was the only one of the four conspirators who did not participate in the actual escape, as he had not gone through his hole before and only had left a little piece that he could simply punch through only to find out that there was a metal bar there. The others decided to leave him and took the life raft with them. With no means of leaving the island, West had no choice but to remain in his cell until the escape was discovered the next morning. After the escape was discovered he gave several interviews to the FBI and prison authorities, during which he provided full details of the escape plan, possibly as part of a plea bargaining strategy. West was never charged for trying to escape from Alcatraz.
West left Alcatraz on February 6, 1963, then was transferred to McNeil Island, Washington, and later Atlanta, Georgia. After his release from federal prison on January 7, 1965, West was sent to serve prison sentences in Georgia and Florida. He was released in 1967 but was later arrested in Florida on charges of grand larceny, robbery and attempted escape. Receiving multiple sentences, including life imprisonment, West was sent to Florida state prison in January 1969. On October 30, 1972, he fatally stabbed another prisoner in what may have been a racially-motivated incident. In December 1978, suffering severe abdominal pains, West was sent to the Shands Teaching Hospital, where he died of acute peritonitis on December 21, 1978, at the age of 49.
Escape.
By September 1961 Morris, West, and the Anglin brothers were planning an escape attempt, which they carried out on the night of June 11, 1962. They fabricated dummy heads from a mixture of soap, toilet paper and real hair, and left them in their beds to fool prison officers making night-time inspections. They escaped from their cells by crawling through holes in the cell walls which they had dug with spoons over the course of a year. This put them into an unused service corridor. West could not make it out of his cell and was left behind. 
From the service corridor they climbed a ventilation shaft to reach the roof. The trio then climbed down from the rooftop, scaled the prison's fence and assembled a raft from the prison's standard-issue raincoats and contact cement. They pumped up the raft on the northeastern coast of the island. At around 10 p.m. they climbed aboard, shoved off, and started paddling. Security guards brushed off the loud sound of the shaft smashing through the roof as nothing serious. Since nothing more was heard, the issue was left unpursued. 
Investigation.
The next morning it was discovered that the trio had escaped. At first it was thought that the escapees had been decapitated. Only upon further scrutiny did the guards realize that the heads were part of a clever escape plot. Police searched for the escapees on Alcatraz and Angel Island without success. An investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was begun as well. 
Remnants of the raft, paddles, and a bag containing the Anglins' personal effects were found on Angel Island. According to the FBI, while it was theoretically possible for the three inmates to have reached Angel Island, the cold water temperature and direction of the ocean's tides made this unlikely. The FBI also said that the plans of the inmates were to steal clothes and a car once they reached land, although no car or clothing thefts were reported in the area following the escape. The case was closed by the FBI on December 31, 1979, after a 17-year investigation. It was concluded that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland. 
As late as September 2009, the case was still being investigated by the U.S. Marshals Service, according to a story broadcast on NPR. Deputy U.S. Marshal Michael Dyke told NPR, "There's an active warrant and the Marshals Service doesn't give up looking for people," he said. "In this case, this would be like saying, 'Well, yeah, they probably are dead. We're going to quit looking.' Well, there's no proof they're dead, so we're not going to quit looking." Dyke said that he still receives leads, including one as recently as two weeks before the story aired.
A 2003 "Mythbusters" episode on the Discovery Channel tested the feasibility of an escape from the island on a raincoat raft, and concluded that it was "possible", though the team concluded that the inmates could not have reached Angel Island with the tides, but that they instead went for the Marin Headlands. A 2011 program on the National Geographic Channel reported that investigators found footprints on Angel Island leading away from the raft, and had also identified a blue Chevrolet that had been stolen that night, contrary to the FBI report.
In popular culture.
In 1963, J. Campbell Bruce published his book "Escape from Alcatraz" about escapes from Alcatraz Island, including that of Morris and the Anglin brothers.
The 1979 film "Escape from Alcatraz" stars Clint Eastwood, Fred Ward, and Jack Thibeau as Frank Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin, respectively. Allen West was played by Larry Hankin; his character's name was changed to Charley Butts. The film strongly implied that the men made it to the mainland.

There are numerous settlements in the Bille territory, which combine with the Bille town to form the Bille kingdom. These are situated in various locations around the area that used to be under the control of the Bille people in the pre-colonial days. The Bille town is the major settlement in the kingdom, which served as the headquarters of the ancient Bille Empire.
Bille town, like other coastal towns, is a low-lying land in the vast mangrove forest region of the Niger Delta and is only a few feet above the sea level. It is situated in the south-eastern part of the present Degema Local Government Area of the Rivers State. It is an island on the bank of the Bille Creek, a tributary of the Sombrero River (Ololo Toru). As an island, it was surrounded by water with a channel dividing it into two; hence, kala anga and opu anga, and thus one can drive round the town until in the late seventies when the southern axis - the Angula and Osia sections - was sand filled for expansion. The main land is now joined with the sand-filled area and extends into the mangrove forest, which is still being reclaimed.
Someone coming from Degema will sail along the Sombrero River southwards into the Opu Bille kubu creek and further southwards into the Kala Bille kubu opposite the Ibi Iriawo Anga (now extinct after the Bille-Kalabari war of 2000) settlement. After about 4 turns from the entrance of the Kala Bille kubu, the town is immediately sighted, welcoming you into its warm embrace.
A visitor from Port Harcourt can board a speedboat or any sea vessel at the various jetties but usually at the Bille waterside along the Creek Road, Port Harcourt. From there, the boat will sail southwards along numerous routes and later cross the New Calabar River or Kalabari Toru within fifteen minutes from take-off and pass through the Awun Toru unto the Touma creek before entering the Oro kubu that runs to the shore of Bille. The new site (Iwo-ama) - a newly reclaimed mass of land - adjacent the town with school structures and playing fields is the first port of call. Thereafter, the boat will sail past the Green poku, Asuka poku, Abekereme poku and finally berth at the Siran poku where the first jetty is sited.
The Bille town has five basic entry points (all creeks), viz.; the Kala Bille kubu, the Besi kubu, which terminates at the Teinma (besi) boko or meinma anga opposite the Ibilan poku, the Oliyama anga, the Oro kubu and the Oruama boko. The Oliyama anga is the lower stream that starts from the Bille creek and leads to such southern places and towns as the Bille 1 Flow Station, Ke, Kula, Abissa, etc.
Among the other major settlements in the Bille kingdom where Bille people as well as fishermen and traders of various tribes reside include; Jikeama, Touma, Krikama, Ekema, Oruama, Oboma, etc. although there are also numerous smaller settlements used for plantations. Some of these include: Makiridikianga, Sekiyabo-kurowa, Ele, Emannuel-kiri, Enesirama, Imopeleye ama, Ikpabiraba-daba, Dikama, Duroko, Ninama, Owu poku-obu, Feni-paan, Borma, Ibi-iriawo anga, Nonjuama, Madu-kiri, Amabiofiyema, Kari-ama, Epeka, Singi-kiri, etc. All these locations surround the Bille town, which is at the centre of the Bille kingdom.
In the 1935 Intelligent Report on the Kalabari Clan in the Degema Division of the Owerri Province, Captain Kelsey, the District Officer at the time said, “the inhabitants of Bille share rights of the rivers boundaries with Bonny only, commencing from the left side of Anwokiri-toru now known as Kalabari toru which has its start (sic) from Anya creek near Bakana to the Bar.”
In the same Report, Bille's fishing ports along the Anwokiri-toru and Bille Obu-toru were recorded to include “Tunduro bokobe kiri, Emmanuel kiri, Greenkiri or Feni-paan, Wosaba, Touma, Ekulekule-tombi and Dabira”. Others were “Ibi iriawo angabe kiri, Kala-Bille bokobe kiri, Minji du kiri all in the Bille Kubu creek while along the Opu Bille boko there are the Opu Bille bokobe kiri and the Oruama bokobe kiri, Oruama kiri, Imopeleye bokobe kiri, Imopeleye, Eli kiri, Dokubo kiri, Dikama, Ogbodo piri, Ekema kiri, Balo bokobe kiri, and Torusira bokobe kiri.”
The Report further identified rivers owned and controlled by Bille as Ololo Toru (Sombrero River) up to Ndele Toru, Obu Toru and the river stretching from Anwu Toru to the Anya creek.
The limit of the boundaries of the old kingdoms of Kalabari and Bille is described in paragraphs 117 and 118 of the 1949/50 Report of the Commission of Enquiry into the Okrika - Kalabari Dispute by Mr. Justice G. G. Robinson. The case for Bille is however very plain as in paragraph 118 where the Robinson Report described the boundaries of New Calabar (Kalabari) by adopting the Supreme Court of Nigeria decision on the issue. The facts are reproduced below:
118 So it is interesting to see what territory was given to the Kalabaris by the judgement (of the Supreme Court). It is as follows:
‘I regard therefore all that territory from the Old Shipping extending to Bakana, Buguma and Abonnema (including Degema) and as far west as the Kula country occupied by the New Calabar people over which they have exercised ownership for at least forty (40) years and which is now the territorial property of the chiefs and people of New Calabar as representing the people of New Calabar and this property includes all lands, banks of rivers, ponds and creeks and swamps and includes the New Calabar River and the Ekwe River and all its tributaries in the territory of which Old Shipping, Bakana, Buguma, Abonnema, Degema and Kula may be regarded as boundaries but excluding the country of the Billes who appear to have never lost their independence’ (Emphasis mine)
This much was repeated in a memorandum submitted to the Rivers State Sub-Committee on Boundary Changes by Chief (Dr.) Harold J. Dappa-Biriye on October 10, 1997. In the memo, he further asserted that,
“The Billes who released Old Shipping to the Kalabari know that the middle of the New Calabar River is our (Bonny/Bille) boundary. This is evident in the map of Bille boundary tendered to the Mbanefo Inquiry Panel and forwarded here as well.”
The people of Bille have maintained these locations and boundaries even in the colonial period in spite of the expansionist threats from her immediate neighbours and benefactors. The Bille territory is the area that has more oil and mineral deposits in the present Degema Local Government Area.
History.
Most writers from Bille place the founding of Bille in about the 9th century on the basis of tradition and linguistic research of other sister clans like Bonny. Others are more inclined to accept a date prior to the fourteenth century for which one can reliably adopt the 9th century as the authentic period when the actual movement from the Benin Empire began.
Queen Ikpakiaba founded ancient Bille many centuries ago with several colleagues who fled their original settlement because of an internal conflict amongst the inhabitants. The people of Bille were said to have emigrated from the old Benin Empire. It is difficult to ascertain the accurate date from Oral tradition even as dates cannot be easily proven because of the difficulty in arriving at accurate data due to the level of knowledge about the calendar in those days.
Nonetheless, one will not equally be wrong to assert that a thriving and long established Bille community existed with its kings by the 15th century as recorded by early writers. According to Pacheco Pereira in the Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis (1505–1520), the Ijo people of Bille were already trading on slaves. Thus if by 1520 someone from Europe had written about a Bille community which was in slave trade, then one can conveniently proclaim that our Bille may have been established long ago before being strong enough to partake in such a serious and dangerous trade.
In addition, Jones (1963) refers to a raid in neighbouring Kalabari towns of slaves by Bille under King Agbaniye Jike. He equally referred to a Bonny tradition concerning the development of the slave trade under King Asimini, and the development of the Kalabari slave trade under the contemporary King Owerri Daba (Owereya Dappa). See Alagoa & Fombo 1972.
According to Smith, Robinson & K. Williamson in the ‘Ijo Elements in Berbice Dutch’, Owerri Daba is to be dated to roughly 1600. As indicated by Jones (1963), tradition assigns Agbaniye Jike of Bille to the same generation as Owerri Daba. On the basis of the above reference to Agbaniye Jike as a 17th-century warlord, we can draw inferences to the time of settlement of the first Bille people by adopting the age of Jike who is locally regarded as a 3rd generation Bille man. Jike was born to an already established kingdom with several past rulers before him. In fact, he belongs to the Opu Sira community and from the local permutations, he may have become great after several years under the tutelage of some great fighters even though he was said to have given signs of greatness at his birth.
We will therefore rely on the dates given by the early writers and put pressure on archaeologists to determine the possible period of the first settlement at Bille which will not only be acceptable to historians but will also agree with several artefacts in the community. In the meantime, we may have to rely only on the dates quoted by early local writers and the official position of Bille spokespersons at Tribunals and other public hearings.
We were told that they left the old Benin Empire and moved southwards to the Niger Delta region and first settled around the Tarakiri clan in Central Ijaw before finally settling at a place called Okolo Bille in the present Abua territory situated on the north of Degema on the bank of the Sombrero River. It was at this point that a severe dispute occurred amongst the inhabitants. Oral Tradition relates it to a dispute over the sharing of the head of a special fish called tilapia (atabila) by the rulers during a festival. This resulted into a civil war that caused most of them to emigrate to the south where they founded various towns and settlements.
Origin of Bille.
According to Oral tradition, when Queen Ikpakiaba the Amabinbo of Bille and her peers left Okolo Bille they first drove past an empty piece of land, which at that time was called Ogonobe Ingbetokuru. This is the present day Obuama in the Degema local Government Area. On the same route, they also sighted and passed a big forest (the present site of the Degema consulate) then known as Sukube Ingbetokuru. We are not so sure if there were people already settled at these settlements (they were regarded as barren lands not inhabited by people) as no mention was made of people they had met during their movements. Had they found any one then, the Bille people would have eliminated them on their route to the south of the area.
They later crossed the sea, passed by another big forest (present day Abonnema but then known as Mene), sailed downwards along the Sombrero River up to the entrance of the tributary called Oruama kubu, and sailed thereon. They later stopped at a small forest called Ikpabiraba Daba and stayed there for some days. The barren land is still there till today.
Considering that the place was too small and quite isolated, they left there and moved further along the route until they came to the Besi kubu creek through which they reached the present Bille town. It was then an island divided into two parts by a small channel with openings at two ends (the Opu Osia polo through the Opu Asa/Opu Okira axis). The channel - kroro - is no longer dividing the town into two having been closed for over a century but there are marks of such a channel at the centre of the town and can be traced at the specific places where it transverse.
They entered the channel through the Opu Osia polo axis and moved into the centre of the town where they stopped to observe that some strange creatures were playing masquerades. These creatures later dived into a huge tunnel close to the centre of the town and disappeared. The creatures were later identified as water spirits, owama be apu. This puzzled Queen Ikpakiaba and peers so they left to disclose their new discovery to their people.
When they came the next time, they also saw the mermaids performing their rituals. They later disappeared into the well as they had earlier described to their people. The Bille people found out much later that the tunnel at the centre of the town was actually an under ground channel that ran from the centre of the town to the mouth of the Opu Bille kubu creek along the Sombrero River several kilometres from the town. This was confirmed by the appearance of persons who surfaced at the said place several days after they were drowned in the tunnel at the centre of Bille. That spot is where the present Bolo tree stands at the centre of the town.
On one of the occasional appearances of the mermaids, the early people of Bille negotiated with them to allow them (Bille people) to stay for seven years before they leave to settle elsewhere and they were permitted. Meanwhile, during this period the mermaids occasionally came out of the tunnel to display as they had done on that first day when the Queen first saw them.
When it was time for the Bille people to leave as earlier agreed, they kept on postponing their departure until the mermaids were tired of driving them. They had to leave the Bille people to stay there permanently. The mermaids then gradually reduced their periodic appearances for their regular masquerade displays until they finally stopped coming although they later came in the form of human beings as could be confirmed by the 'carrying' (or possession) of mermaid spirits by some women and the physical appearance of certain persons in the town. The queen and her colleagues were said to have made sacrifices to drive away the creatures before finally settling on the land.
The Bille people copied these displays and performed them regularly and these have become the bedrock of Bille's traditional heritage and a prominent feature of the Bille culture and tradition. The agiri festival has its origin from this discovery. It has, however, undergone numerous changes and innovations with time. The existence of such mermaids turned humans was confirmed by one of them - late Sibisonio Feniobu - who freely educated natives on their mode of operations when requested. He had named many of his peers who had come from their ‘water’ world because of the agiri festival. Unfortunately, most of them have died before the publication of this book.
Queen Ikpakiaba and her adherents thus settled on the land thereby ignoring the more spacious alternatives at the barren lands of the present day Obuama, Degema, and Abonnema, which she had seen but passed while on her route to Bille. She was indeed divinely led to the present land of Bille.
Emigration.
Opu Ogulaya and Opu Suma also emigrated from Akpata Bille and settled on a land now known as Ogoloma. After their settlement, Opu Otubeya, their kinsman, also settled on the other side of the same land. When at a later date both of them met in the bush they identified themselves as persons from the same root and thus proclaimed 'wakiri ke' meaning 'we are not different'. Thus, the place is known even until today as Wakirike although it has been anglicised to the word Okrika.
Some of those who also fled from the old settlement of the Bille people included Opu Okurukuru who founded the present day Kugbo while Opu Ikiya found Ikiakiama. Opu Ogini also left and settled on the land now called Oginiama while Opu Krobo also emigrated and settled on a land which is the present day Nkoro town in the Andonni Local Government Area. It has been confirmed that the people of Nkoro regard the eating of the tilapia fish as a taboo because of the historical significance.
Only recently, the people of Bille have discovered that there is also another place called Bille in northern Nigeria. On a maiden visit to the newfound land of Bille in Adamawa State of Nigeria between March 3 and 8, 2004, the Bille delegation comprising Chief O. G S. Digbani, Chief D. W. Herbert, Mr Ibim Watson Sanipe (representing the CDC), Ibinabo Thompson (representing the Bille Youths Federation) and Rev. Dr F. J. Igani was told that their forefathers actually travelled far north to settle at their present settlement and have over time become engulfed by the overbearing Hausa community. They claimed that their ancestors also migrated from a certain place called Bille because of a dispute over fish in the past but they were not sure of the original place they left. Incidentally, they have the same local names for such items as fish and water. The people also have the same names for the numbers as we have here in Bille.
According to recorded history, Bille was the sole power in the old Degema Division sharing boundaries then with other eastern Ijaw clans like Nembe, Bonny, and Okrika with whom she fought several wars. So great was her one time ruler, Agbani ye Jike, that the entire territory was under his influence although he conquered settlements without settling anybody for security reasons. It was the policy of the ancient people of Bille during Jike's era to eliminate all persons in the conquered territories and settlements leaving a barren land, which, unfortunately, had left Bille as a one-city kingdom. Gladly, life has begun in most of the other settlements especially at Jikeama, Touma etc. as we look forward to an ideal Bille kingdom.
Other towns that also claim an early existence including Ke, Idama and Kula were founded according to Oral Tradition by persons of Bille origin some of whom rebelled against the king and emigrated there and by Bille people dropped on such lands because of their abominable ailment. Kula was established by Opu Ada ye Sira of Sira Community in Bille. Agbaniye Kio, a brother of King Jike also left Bille when he had a dispute with his brother and settled on the land that is now known as Idama. In the Captain Kelsey Report of 1935, the claim of Bille over the town of Ke was recorded although because of the time lapse the Ke people now deny this claim, as the Bille people did not exercise authority over it for the obvious reasons that they were actually a neglected people cast out of Bille and were thus not prone to attacks from Bille or other aggressors.
They were all regarded as sister settlements and were thus never attacked by the Bille people. They were semi-autonomous in the period until in the later part of the last century when they sought and got the protection of the Kalabari king thus becoming a part of the Kalabari kingdom. This was a period of trading and European influence predating the colonial era when inter-tribal wars were on the decline and kings were not renowned for conquering territories but for their resistance against the European powers.
Relationship with other clans.
Several reasons have been adduced to explain why it was not possible for the people of Bille to move out of the present location to found new lands like her sister kingdoms. The chief reason is security, as the numerous wars and attacks from aggressors prevented persons from moving to settle on isolated islands and locations where they would be prone to severe attacks. They were only content with going out on fishing expeditions and coming back safe to Bille. Being a warring era, it was safer to stay in the hinterland where Bille town is situated as it took enemies much difficulty to drive through the creeks before reaching the town. In fact, before anybody could attempt such an attack on Bille he would have been subdued on his way by the ever-ready warriors who patrolled the creeks on a regular basis.
In addition, the ancient Bille people never trusted strangers as to settle natives amongst them on such conquered settlements for fear of uprisings and further enemy attacks. Therefore, Bille remained a safe haven for the great warriors of Bille in the Niger Delta region from the reign of King Agbani ye Jike until the advent of colonialism. To this day, because of his prowess and his sustenance of the Bille Empire in that period, the title of the Amanyanabo (king) of Bille is named after him.
One can also add that the near perfect living style of the Bille people whereby the extended family system allowed members of one family to share a single building equally contributed to the inability of people to move and settle elsewhere. In Bille, it is still possible for two brothers to share one building inherited from their father and both would always live together happily without molestation. This is absent in so many other communities as elder brothers have been reported to have chased away their younger ones and other relations from their inherited homes. This ordinarily would push one to seek elsewhere to find accommodation and had, in most cases, led people to develop barren lands to settle.
However, the most appropriate reason why the other clans have a relatively superior numerical strength is the large number of slaves bought and allowed to be members of those clans. In those days, noble men in places like Bonny and Kalabari were recognised by the number of slaves they kept. The slaves were later given freedom and made to belong to the families of their masters hence the growth in population of these clans. This much was confirmed by Ebiegberi J. Alagoa and Adadonye Fombo in their book, “A Chronicle of Grand Bonny”, Ibadan University Press, published in 1972. Quoting Robin Horton’s “From Fishing Village to City-state”, the authors believed that ‘whereas Elem Kalabari insisted on the complete acculturation of slaves to be integrated into the House System, Bonny does not seem to have full acculturation. Thus, although both states took part in the slave trade and absorbed large numbers of Ibo slaves into their communities, the Kalabari have preserved their language and culture, while Bonny has become bilingual in Ibo and Ibani. Thus, although the system of integration into the lineage or House System worked faultlessly in Bonny, the same policy was not pursued in the cultural field.’
Much of this though had to do with early exposure to persons from other tribes particularly the Europeans. Therefore, it was easy for noble men and chiefs from the neighbouring places to purchase slaves and give them freedom so that they help them in their new hinterland trade with the whites after slave trade was abolished. This was not the case in Bille even as intermarriage was relatively less between the Bille people and other clans. As a result, a proper census of the true natives in all the clans under reference will reveal that Bille has more genuine natives than all the other clans where people of mixed blood abound.
The need to expand the Bille Kingdom beyond the one-city status had in the past ten years invigorated the clamour for the development and transformation of the fishing settlements to the status of villages. This had resulted in the request for and approval of many such villages by the Bille Council of Chiefs. These new villages have also been recommended to the management of the SPDC for the purpose of establishing Community Development Committees and for membership of the Bille Youth Federation.
Settlement of Kalabari.
Originally settled at Elem Kalabari by the Bille people when they came from Duke Town in the present Akwa Ibom state, the Kalabari people have moved totally from there to found great cities, towns and villages with Buguma as the seat of their king. The old single towns have greatly evolved to become clans. Oral tradition and recorded history has it that one Mfon Manuel and a group of his people left Duke’s Town and sailed down to Bonny where they met the king of Bonny. On hearing that they had fled from their former domain and are in search of a new settlement the Bonny monarch took them to his brother king at Bille and requested him to give him a portion of his vast territory for his guests. His exact words as recorded for posterity were, “kele pa imbari” literally meaning, ‘please, give them some land’ to settle. It is this initial expression that the Bille people later used in identifying their Duke Town strangers that had metamorphosed, over time, to become the name ‘kalabari’.
This is the authentic history of the Kalabaris and any other version given and which does not tally with the Bille position is a fallacy because the people of Kalabari had referred all cases concerning the correct version of their history to the Bille people even in the early thirties. According to palace sources in Bille, made available to the Press team during the drafting of the memorandum submitted to the State Commission on the Kalabari / Bille Conflict, there are records of visits to Bille by some Kalabari chiefs to request the people of Bille to speak the truth concerning the rightful owners of the kingship of the Kalabari kingdom. Their visits were recorded in a minute-book kept by the Bille king for visitors. As a rule, the Secretary of the Council of Chiefs, usually a non-chief who was however literate, wrote the minutes for the chiefs in those days.
In one of the minutes of such meetings between the Kalabari visitors and the chiefs of Bille recorded on April 28, 1933 and written by the Secretary, late Mr A. O. Sibi (he later became a chief), a group of chiefs and people of Kalabari namely Chiefs Samuel Berriboyle, Ebenezer Don Pedro, Messrs. Obu Berriboyle, Tom Braide and Johnbull Yellowe came from Abonnema as representatives of the KALAGBEA House to inform the Amanyanabo and the chiefs of Bille about the dispute between the Kalagbea House and the Amachree House in Kalabari.
The Bille people present were Amanyanabo Igolima Dappa, Chiefs Abel Uriah, Efrenbo Nangi, Irionu, Joel Siala, Bruce Mgbe, Charles Sibi, Edward Bibi, Walter Bibi, Isaiah, etc.
Chief Ebenezer Don Pedro was the spokesman of the visiting Kalabari team. He explained to the Bille chiefs that they had come to inform them that the Kalabari nation had been split into two over the claim to the throne and kingship. He disclosed that the Amachree House had claimed to be the “supreme owners of the Kalabari land and that Amachree was the owner of the land as he was the first of all the kings”. He went on to state the position of the Kalagbea House who insist that there had been others who ruled the nation (Kalabari) in succession before the advent of Amachree. According to the Kalagbea House, Amachree was a slave and there were about 14 to 15 kings before his arrival.
Their aim of coming to Bille, he further stated, was to inform the Bille people that they (the Kalagbea House) had told the District Officer (D.O.) that “there had been a people – Bille – who are the original owners of all this part – Delta Section – and that they are the only people in this part when they (the Kalabari people) came. And that these said people can identify the way and manner late Amachree came to the Kalabari land, and of the fact of the suzerainty of the predecessors who ruled the nation.”
“That they should be consulted as to the fact of this. Besides the Bille, Bonny and Brass could corroborate too, but the Bille people are core of the facts” (sic).
He then disclosed that the D. O. had promised to come and interview the Bille people, and so they had come to intimate the chiefs of Bille of such an intended visit by the D. O. As recorded by Mr Sibi (as he was then), the chiefs through late Bruce Mgbe thanked them for the visit and the kind sentiments expressed in owning up that the Bille people are the original owners or settlers of all these parts. He promised that the Bille people were ready to explain the truth to the D. O. whenever he comes.
On April 6, 1935, the Kalagbea House members came again to Bille to remind the Bille of their last visit. Only two persons came. They were Chief Stanley Don Pedro and Michael Romeo Georgewill both of Abonnema. At that time, the Secretary was late Mr (later Rev.) W. B. Herbert. They were received by King Igolima Dappa, Chief Isaiah Osinbo, Chief Abel Uriah, and Chief Joel Siala. Others were Messrs. Ebenezer Kari, Joseph Williams, Olu Jacob and Gilbert Bibi.

Side road

A side road is a minor highway typically leading off a main road. A side road may be so minor as to be uncategorized with a road number.
In an urban area, a side road may be a narrow street leading off a more major street, especially in a residential area.
Side street.
A side street is a street that intersects a main street and ends there. It is generally of little importance to through traffic. Being the last mile of the road system, it generally carries little traffic. Common characteristics of a side street include low speed limits (usually not more than 30 mph or 50 km/h), curbside parking, and few or no painted line markings to display lanes. Intersections in urban or suburban areas are usually marked by stop signs, or occasionally yield signs in some suburban areas when intersecting other side streets. In rural areas, some intersections are uncontrolled.
Most side streets are lined with residences. Occasionally, a place of worship or a school may be located on a side street, but in a residential area, it is rare to find any commercial development (this is often prohibited by local zoning laws, unless directly adjacent to a major street).
Side streets, when built, are mostly intended only for the traffic of their residents and visitors. However, many side streets that do not dead end are also used for rat running by motorists in congested areas.

CSS General Beauregard

CSS "General Beauregard" was a cotton-clad sidewheel ram of the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War.
Built in Algiers, Louisiana in 1847 as a towboat, the paddle steamer "Ocean" was selected in January 1862 by Capt. James E. Montgomery, former river steamboat master, for his River Defense Fleet. At New Orleans, on 25 January, Captain Montgomery began her conversion to a cotton-clad ram, installing oak and iron sheathing over her bow, with cotton bales sandwiched between double pine bulkheads to protect her boilers. 
Service history.
Battle of Plum Point Bend.
Conversion completed on 5 April, and now renamed CSS "General Beauregard", the ship steamed to Fort Pillow, Tennessee, to defend the approaches to Memphis. On 10 May 1862, "General Beauregard", Capt. J. H. Hart, and seven more of Montgomery's fleet, attacked the Federal Mississippi ironclad flotilla. The Battle of Plum Point Bend witnessed effective ramming tactics by the Confederates, although "General Beauregard" succeeded only in keeping her four 8-inch guns bravely firing in the face of a withering hail of Union shells. Montgomery's force held off the Federal rams until Fort Pillow was safely evacuated, 4 June, then fell back on Memphis to coal, on the fifth.
Battle of Memphis.
After Fort Pillow fell, Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis, USN, commanding the Mississippi River Squadron, lost no time in appearing off Memphis, on 6 June 1862. Montgomery, with a smaller squadron short of fuel, was unable to retreat to Vicksburg; unwilling to destroy his boats, he fought against heavy odds. In the ensuing Battle of Memphis, "witnessed by thousands on the bluff," "Beauregard" unluckily missed ramming and "cut away entirely the port wheel and wheel-house" of her partner, CSS "General Sterling Price", also engaging "Monarch". "General Beauregard", backing out, gave Union flagship a close broadside with a 42-pounder, and "Benton" replied with a shot into the Confederate's boiler, killing or scalding many of her crew, 14 of whom, in agony, were rescued by "Benton". "General Beauregard" exploded and was sinking fast as "Monarch" captured the rest of her complement and took her in tow towards the Arkansas shore, where the wreck remained for a short time partially visible in shoal water.

Boma tribe

The Boma tribe (Bumo) of the Ijaw people live in Bayelsa State, Nigeria. The thirteen Bumo settlements are: Diebu, Emette, Eniwari, Ekowe, Emette, Ikianbiri, Peremabiri, Kayankiri, Ologoama, Ofonibiri, Polobugo, Seibiri, and Igbematoru. There are no common cultural institutions within the Boma tribe, nor do they worship a common clan god. Their Boma identity derives from their tradition of common origin.

Tensor network theory

Tensor network theory is a theory of brain function (particularly that of the cerebellum) that provides a mathematical model of the transformation of sensory space-time coordinates into motor coordinates and vice versa by cerebellar neuronal networks. The theory was developed by Andras Pellionisz and Rodolfo Llinas in the 1980s as a geometrization of brain function (especially of the central nervous system) using tensors.
History.
Geometrization movement of the mid-20th century.
The mid-20th century saw a concerted movement to quantify and provide geometric models for various fields of science, including biology and physics. The geometrization of biology began in the 1950s in an effort to reduce concepts and principles of biology down into concepts of geometry similar to what was done in physics in the decades before. In fact, much of the geometrization that took place in the field of biology took its cues from the geometrization of contemporary physics. One major achievement in general relativity was the geometrization of gravitation. This allowed the trajectories of objects to be modeled as geodesic curves (or optimal paths) in a Riemannian space manifold. During the 1980s, the field of theoretical physics also witnessed an outburst of geometrization activity in parallel with the development of the Unified Field Theory, the Theory of Everything, and the similar Grand Unified Theory, all of which attempted to explain connections between known physical phenomena.
<br>
<br>
The geometrization of biology in parallel with the geometrization of physics covered a multitude of fields, including populations, disease outbreaks, and evolution, and continues to be an active field of research even today. By developing geometric models of populations and disease outbreaks, it is possible to predict the extent of the epidemic and allow public health officials and medical professionals to control disease outbreaks and better prepare for future epidemics. Likewise, there is work being done to develop geometric models for the evolutionary process of species in order to study the process of evolution, the space of morphological properties, the diversity of forms and spontaneous changes and mutations. 
Geometrization of the brain and tensor network theory.
Around the same time as all of the developments in the geometrization of biology and physics, some headway was made in the geometrization of neuroscience. At the time, it became more and more necessary for brain functions to be quantified in order to study them more rigorously. Much of the progress can be attributed to the work of Pellionisz and Llinas and their associates who developed the tensor network theory in order to give researchers a means to quantify and model central nervous system activities. 
<br>
<br>
In 1980, Pellionisz and Llinas introduced their tensor network theory to describe the behavior of the cerebellum in transforming afferent sensory inputs into efferent motor outputs. They proposed that intrinsic multidimensional central nervous system space could be described and modeled by an extrinsic network of tensors that together describe the behavior of the central nervous system. By treating the brain as a "geometrical object" and assuming that (1) neuronal network activity is vectorial and (2) that the networks themselves are organized tensorially, brain function could be quantified and described simply as a network of tensors. 
Example.
Vestibulo-ocular reflex.
In 1986, Pellionisz described the geometrization of the "three-neuron vestibulo-ocular reflex arc" in a cat using tensor network theory. The "three-neuron vestibulo-ocular reflex arc" is named for the three neuron circuit the comprises the arc. Sensory input into the vestibular system (angular acceleration of the head) is first received by the primary vestibular neurons which subsequently synapse onto secondary vestibular neurons. These secondary neurons carry out much of the signal processing and produce the efferent signal heading for the oculomotor neurons. Prior to the publishing of this paper, there had been no quantitative model to describe this "classic example of a basic sensorimotor transformation in the central nervous system" which is precisely what tensor network theory had been developed to model. 
<br>
<br> 
Here, Pellionisz described the analysis of the sensory input into the vestibular canals as the covariant vector component of tensor network theory. Likewise, the synthesized motor response (reflexive eye movement) is described as the contravariant vector component of the theory. By calculating the neuronal network transformations between the sensory input into the vestibular system and the subsequent motor response, a metric tensor representing the neuronal network was calculated. 
<br>
<br>
The resulting metric tensor allowed for accurate predictions of the neuronal connections between the three intrinsically orthogonal vestibular canals and the six extraocular muscles that control the movement of the eye.
Applications.
Neural Networks and Artificial Intelligence.
Neural networks modeled after the activities of the central nervous system have allowed researchers to solve problems impossible to solve by other means. Artificial neural networks are now being applied in various applications to further research in other fields.
One notable non-biological application of the tensor network theory was the simulated automated landing of a damaged F-15 fighter jet on one wing using a "Transputer parallel computer neural network". The fighter jet's sensors fed information into the flight computer which in turn transformed that information into commands to control the plane's wing-flaps and ailerons to achieve a stable touchdown. This was synonymous to sensory inputs from the body being transformed into motor outputs by the cerebellum. The flight computer's calculations and behavior was modeled as a metric tensor taking the covariant sensor readings and transforming it into contravariant commands to control aircraft hardware. Other applications include teaching computers how to recognize handwriting, speech, and traffic signs by using deep learning which utilizes artificial neural networks.

Hamilcar I of Carthage

Hamilcar I of Carthage was a Magonid king of Carthage, in present day Tunisia, from 510 to 480 BCE.
Rule.
Treaty with Rome.
Carthage had concluded treaties with several powers, but the ones with Rome is the most famous. In 509 BC, a treaty was signed between Carthage and Rome indicating a division of influence and commercial activities. This is the first known source indicating that Carthage had gained control over Sicily and Sardinia, as well as Emporia and the area south of Cape Bon in Africa. Carthage may have signed the treaty with Rome, then an insignificant backwater, because Romans had treaties with the Phocaeans and Cumae, who were aiding the Roman struggle against the Etruscans at that time. Carthage had similar treaties with Etruscan, Punic and Greek cities in Sicily.
By the end of the 6th Century BC, Carthage had conquered most of the old Phoenician colonies e.g. Hadrumetum, Utica and Kerkouane, subjugated some of the Libyan tribes, and had taken control of parts of the North African coast from modern Morocco to the borders of Cyrenaica. It was also fighting wars in defense of Punic colonies and commerce, however, only the details of her struggle against the Greeks have survived - which often makes Carthage seem "obsessed with Sicily".
First Sicilian War.
The island of Sicily, lying at Carthage's doorstep, became the arena on which this conflict played out. From their earliest days, both the Greeks and Phoenicians had been attracted to the large island, establishing a large number of colonies and trading posts along its coasts. Small battles had been fought between these settlements for centuries. Carthage had to contest with at least three Greek incursions, in 580 BC, in 510 BC and a war in which the city of Heraclea was destroyed. Gelo had fought in the last war and had secured terms for the Greeks.
The Punic domain in Sicily by 500 BC contained the cities of Motya, Panormus and Soluntum. By 490 BC, Carthage had concluded treaties with the Greek cities of Selinus, Himera, and Zankle in Sicily. Gelo, the tyrant of Greek Syracuse, backed in part by support from other Greek city-states, was attempting to unite the island under his rule since 485 BC. When Theron of Akragas, father in law of Gelo, deposed the tyrant of Himera in 483 BC, Carthage decided to intervene at the instigation of the tyrant of Rhegion, who was the father-in-law of the deposed tyrant of Himera.
Hamilcar prepared the largest Punic overseas expedition to date and after three years of preparations, sailed for Sicily. This enterprise coincided with the expedition of Xerxes against mainland Greece in 480 BC, prompting speculations about a possible alliance between Carthage and Persia against the Greeks, although no documented proof of this exists. The Punic fleet was battered by storms en route, and the Punic army was destroyed and Hamilcar killed in the Battle of Himera by the combined armies of Himera, Akragas and Syracuse under Gelo. Carthage made peace with the Greeks and paid a large indemnity of 2000 silver talents, but lost no territory in Sicily.
Weakening of kings.
This defeat had far reaching consequences, both political and economic, for Carthage. Politically, the old government of entrenched nobility was ousted, replaced by the Carthaginian Republic. The “King” was still elected, but their power began to erode, with the senate and the "Tribunal of 104" gaining dominance in political matters, and the position of "Suffet" becoming more influential. Economically, sea-borne trade with the Middle East was cut off by the mainland Greeks and Magna Graecia boycotted Carthaginian traders. This led to the development of trade with the West and of caravan-borne trade with the East. Gisco, son of Hamilcar was exiled, and Carthage for the next 70 years made no recorded forays against the Greeks nor aided either the Elymians/Sicels or the Etruscans, then locked in struggle against the Greeks, or sent any aid to the Greek enemies of Syracuse, then the leading Greek city in Sicily. Based on this abstinence from Greek affairs, it is commented that Carthage was crippled after the defeat of Himera.

Tytus Filipowicz

Tytus Filipowicz (1873-1953) was a Polish politician and diplomat. 
Life.
Filipowicz was born 21 November 1873 in Warsaw. He attended school in Dąbrowa Górnicza. He worked as a coal miner and became a socialist political activist; from 1895 he was active in the Dąbrowa Workers' Commiittee. He became an active member of the Polish Socialist Party ("PPS") and editor of a socialist paper for miners ("Górnik", Miner). In 1901 he was arrested by the authorities but escaped to Russian-ruled Warsaw.
During the "PPS" split, he sided with the Polish Socialist Party – Revolutionary Faction and became a close collaborator of future Polish statesman Józef Piłsudski. He accompanied Piłsudski on his 1904 voyage to Japan. In 1905 Filipowicz was imprisoned by the Russian Empire in the Warsaw Citadel, but escaped.
Under the Second Polish Republic, he was briefly deputy or acting (sources vary) Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs (11–17 November 1918). Later he was named Poland's ambassador to Georgia—due to his involvement in Piłsudski's Prometheist project—but in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Georgia (which was subsequently annexed as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic) he did not assume this post but was instead arrested there by the Soviets and interned. After the treaty of Riga ended the Polish-Soviet War in 1921, he become the first Polish chargé d'affaires in the Soviet Union, organizing the Polish embassy there. Later he was a diplomat in Finland, Belgium and the United States (1929-32). In 1933 he returned to the Soviet Union for a brief posting as ambassador.
In 1934, with Gabriel Czechowicz, Filipowicz co-founded the Polish Radical Party ("Polska Partia Radykalna"), a dissident offshoot of Sanation that, while largely adhering to political liberalism, advocated that Poland become a Christian state, with official preferences given to ethnic Poles, and Jews being encouraged to emigrate.
During and after World War II, Filipowicz was a member of the Polish Government in Exile and of the National Council of the Republic of Poland (1941–42 and 1949–53).
He died August 18, 1953, in London.

Eusebius (praepositus sacri cubiculi)

Eusebius (died 361) was a high-ranking officer of the Roman Empire, holding the position of "praepositus sacri cubiculi" for all the rule of Emperor Constantius II (337-361).
Biography.
Eusebius held the position of "praepositus sacri cubiculi" in 337, when Constantine I died; he concealed the will of the Emperor. Eusebius became a supporter of Arianism, influencing the emperess and many other eunuchs. He entered then at the service of one of Constantine's sons and successors, Constantius II, with whom he shared the support for Arianism and on whom he exerted a great influence.
In 354 Eusebius was sent by Constantius II to talk to Pope Liberius and then attended at the meeting between the Emperor and the Pope. He sent money to the orator Libanius in exile and, in 355, helped those Arian bishops who plotted against Athanasius of Alexandria.
Eusebius followed Constantius into Gaul (353-354) and then to Milan (354). Here he plotted against Constantius' cousin, brother-in-law and Caesar, Constantius Gallus; Constantius ordered him to go to Pula, where Gallus was imprisoned, to question him about his rule in the East.
Eusebius enriched himself taking the properties of those who were put to death on accusations of treason; when general Ursicinus refused to give him as a present his house in Antioch, in 359, Eusebius had him recalled from his office as "magister equitum", having Sabinianus as a substitute.
Eusebius was together with Constantius until the Emperor died, in 361. The new Emperor, Julian, set up the Chalcedon tribunal to judge all those officers of Constantius' who had been suspected of corrupt conduct, in particular in the case of the trial and execution of Gallus (Julian's half-brother); Eusebius was accused of plotting against Gallus, was found guilty and put to death.

Glidant

A glidant is a substance that is added to a powder to improve its flowability. A glidant will only work at a certain range of concentrations. Above a certain concentration, the glidant will in fact function to inhibit flowability.
In tablet manufacture, glidants are usually added just prior to compression.
Examples.
Examples of glidants include magnesium stearate, Aerosil (colloidal silicon dioxide), starch and talc.
Mechanism Of Action.
A Glidant's effect is due to a counter-action to factors resulting in poor flowability of powders. For instance, correcting surface irregularity, reducing interparticular friction & decreasing surface charge. The result is a decrease in the angle of repose which is an indication of an enhanced powder's flowability.

From May 2012 till Sept 2013, he was in
jail
under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 for amassing wealth at at an enormous scale by providing quid pro quo favours to businesses. A series of bail applications were repeatedly rejected by three levels of courts 
partly owing to 
"the serious nature of the offence", with estimated "amounts exceeding
Rs. 3000 crores."
The YSR Congress and other opposition parties have alleged that Jagan is being politically victimized and the CBI is acting at the behest of the Congress and that this is a case of political vendetta. After 16 months, on September 23, 2013, a special CBI court granted him bail, but he is not permitted to leave Andhra Pradesh.
Personal life.
Jaganmohan Reddy was born December 21, 1972 in Pulivendula village of Kadapa District, Andhra Pradesh. He received his early education from Pulivendula and Hyderabad Public School. He founded the daily Telugu language newspaper "Sakshi" and the television channel Sakshi TV. He is the chief promoter of Bharathi Cements. Reddy is a Protestant Christian. He has a younger sister, Y. S. Sharmila, a politician.
Political life.
He started his political career by campaigning for Congress party in 2004 elections in Kadapa District, and in the 2009 elections he was elected as member of Parliament from Kadapa constituency as a member of the Indian National Congress.
However, his political career took a new innings with the demise of his father, Chief Minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy ("YSR"). His relationship with the Indian National Congress (INC) continuously deteriorated after his father's death
Six months after his father's death, he began an "odarpu yatra" (condolence tour) as promised earlier to go and meet the families of those alleged to have either committed suicide or suffered ill health on the news of his father's death. The Congress party's central leadership directed him to call off his "odarpu yatra", and order which he defied leading to a fallout between the high command and himself. He went ahead with the "yatra", stating that it was a personal matter.
Jagan as a president of YSR Congress faced by-election from the Kadapa constituency and won by the huge margin of 545,043 votes.
On November 29, 2010, he resigned, after a fallout with the Congress party high command. He announced on 7 December 2010 from Pulivendula that he would be starting a new party within 45 days. In February, 2011, he took over a party which had existed on paper only since the prior July, and was officially recognized on February 16 as president of the YSR Congress Party.
Corruption Charges.
Y.S.R. Reddy's election declaration of 2004 included tax returns showing
Jagan's assets at Rs. 9.2 lakh, out of a total family assets of Rs. 50 lakhs.
In April 2009, Jagan revealed total assets of Rs. 77 crores, and by 2011 this
has allegedly increased to amount Rs. 365 crore.
In August 2011, the Andhra Pradesh High Court, based on preliminary report by the CBI, ordered a thorough probe.
In addition to the CBI, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) have been probing the corruption charges.
Modus operandi: Suitcase companies.
The investigation by the CBI point out several means by which Jagan made money from political favours, adopting
The facade companies floated by Jagan redddy are being called "suitcase companies" both in the media and court orders.
delivered to politicians, but the amounts today are too large for suitcases.
The CBI officials launched country-wide searches on Reddy's offices and residences on 18 August 2011.
Major investors in his companies were also
raided.
In March 2012, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) noted that the state had lost Rs 1 Lakh crore (1 trillion rupees) revenue through
favours granted to land and construction companies.
Evidence for quid-pro-quo and Out-of-norm favours.
The evidence unearthed includes direct favours given to companies who invested with Jagan Reddy's companies.
CBI DIG H. Venkatesh informed the Supreme Court that “India Cements made illegal quid pro quo investments to the tune of Rs 140 crore
into the group companies of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy". In return, they 
received benefits such as permission to draw extra out-of-norm water
from rivers and lease of 
land.
However, India cements CEO N. Srinivasan, who is also the BCCI chief,
subsequently stated that these investments had returned a profit when
Raghuram Cements (later Bharti Cement) was purchased by French firm Vicat.
During an Income Tax raid at the residence of a manager of Dalmia Cement
which invested Rs. 95 crore in the Jagan company Raghuram Cements, IRS
official Vikram Singh Sharma stated that 
The chairman of the large construction firm Ramky Group, 
which was developing a large residential complex, paid Rs 10 crore to Ms
Jagathi Publications (a Jagan-owned company which prints the daily Sakshi). The quid-pro-quo allegedly involved
stamp duty and registration fee that were waived as per a Government Order in 2008 
. Ratna Prabha, an IAS officer who signed this order, later stated that she had
initially opposed the exemptions since it would "adversely affect the revenue of the
state", but that she was overruled by the cabinet of "Y.S.R. Reddy". The properties of Ramky Estates, worth Rs. 135 crores, has been frozen.
In addition to the CBI and the Income Tax Department, the Enforcement Directorate is also investigating Reddy's assets. As of June 2013, the 
Directorate has attached Rs.229.4 crore from various firms associated with him, based on evidence that the money was obtained by giving undue favours.
Arrest and 16 months in jail.
Jagan Reddy was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation
on embezzlement charges and his Judicial custody was
extended repeatedly as the investigation proceeded.
The Andhra Pradesh High Court, in rejecting bail, observed:
The Supreme Court also dismissed his petition
in 4 July 2012, 9 August 2012, and on May 13, 2013.
Meanwhile, the CBI filed a further charge-sheet against him 17 September,
2013. The new charge-sheet relate to the Sandur power and Lepakshi knowledge
hub which were floated by Jagan in which the latter received huge investments
on a quid pro quo arrangement while his father was chief minister (2004 to
2009). After the filing of this chargesheet, the court
granted him bail on the grounds that most of the investigation in the case
was completed.
Charges of political vendetta.
The YSR Congress and Jagan's family have been alleging a political
conspiracy behind Jagan's investigations. BJP has noted that CBI has been pursuing this case with greater vigour than that of government-aligned politicians with similar charges such as Sushil Kumar Shinde or Vilasrao Deshmukh.
On the other side, the CBI’s former joint director V V Laxminaryana has
stated in court that he was being targeted by the YSRC leaders after Jagan's
arrest, and that he was receiving calls threatening his life.
Other Congress ministers arrested for issuing orders.
In March 2012, the Supreme Court directed the CBI to extend their
investigations to six ministers (Kanna Lakshminarayana, Mopidevi Venkata Ramana
Sabita Indra Reddy, Ponnala Lakshmaiah, J Geetha Reddy and
Dharmana Prasada Rao), and eight senior bureaucrats, who were implicated
in issuing 26 Government orders that helped the companies investing in
Jagan's firms.
Andhra Excise minister Mopidevi Venkataramana was arrested on 24 May 2012.
CBI also summoned BCCI chief Mr N Srinivasan on 7 June 2012.
As a sequel to allegations that CBI had selectively released information to the press to tarnish the image of Jaganmohan Reddy, the Central Vigilance Commissioner sought a report on the matter from the investigating agency.
Opposition to the formation of Telengana.
Even while in jail, Reddy had started a hunger strike opposing the United Progressive Alliance's decision to endorse the creation of a separate Telangana state. After 125 hours of indefinite hunger strike, his sugar levels and BP were down. Later He was shifted to Osmania General Hospital for treatment
His mother, MLA VIjayamma, is also on hunger strike protesting the formation
of Telengana out of AP.
After his release, Reddy has called for a 72-hour bandh protesting the
formation of Telengana.
Both Jagan and his mother have resigned from their legislatures opposing the
Telengana decision

Baillie-Grohman Canal

The Baillie-Grohman Canal was a shipping canal between the headwaters of the Columbia River and the upper Kootenay River in the East Kootenay region of British Columbia at a place now known as Canal Flats, BC. The construction of the canal was required by the provincial government of British Columbia as a condition of the canal's promoter receiving substantial land concessions from the provincial government of British Columbia in the area of Creston, BC. The promoter, William Adolf Baillie-Grohman (1851–1921), was a wealthy adventurer, hunter author, and business promoter. He declared the canal to be complete in 1889. The canal was an expensive failure, being used only three times during its entire existence. In 1902, on the last use by a vessel, the sternwheeler "North Star", the sternwheeler's captain, Frank P. Armstrong deliberately blew out the canal's lower lock gates with dynamite to allow the transit of his vessel.
Geographic setting.
The Baillie-Grohman Canal was suggested by the unusual geographic setting of the sources of the Columbia and the Kootenay Rivers. The Columbia River begins at Columbia Lake, flows north in the Rocky Mountain Trench through the Columbia Valley to Windermere Lake to Golden, BC. The Kootenay River flows south from the Rocky Mountains, then west into the Rocky Mountain Trench, coming within just over a mile from Columbia Lake, at a point called Canal Flats, where a shipping canal was built in 1889. The Kootenay then flows south down the Rocky Mountain Trench, crosses the international border and then turns north back into Canada and into Kootenay Lake near the town of Creston, BC.
Rail construction in Canada and the United States made steam navigation possible in the Rocky Mountain Trench. There were two important railheads, Golden, BC and Jennings, Montana, near Libby. At Golden, the transcontinental line of the Canadian Pacific Railway ("CPR"), which parallels the Columbia south from the bridge at Donald, turns east to follow the Kicking Horse River, surmounting the Continental Divide at Kicking Horse Pass, then running past the resort at Banff then east to Calgary. Jennings was reached by the Great Northern Railway, built across the Northern United States from Minnesota to Washington by James J. Hill. Between these railheads the Rocky Mountain Trench ran for 300 miles, almost all of which was potentially accessible to steam navigation. Canal Flats was close to the midpoint, being just south of Columbia Lake, 124 miles upstream from Golden.
William A. Baillie-Grohman.
In the early 1880s a wealthy European adventurer, William Adolf Baillie-Grohman (1851–1921), travelled to the Kootenay Region and became obsessed with developing an area far down the Kootenay River near the southern end of Kootenay Lake called Kootenay Flats. The problem for Baillie-Grohman was that the Kootenay River kept flooding Kootenay Flats. Baillie-Grohman thought the downstream flooding could be lessened by diverting the upstream portion of the Kootenay River into the Columbia River through the Canal Flats. This would have increased the water flow through the Columbia River, particularly near Golden and Donald, where Baillie-Grohman's proposal, if it had been implemented, would have threatened to flood the newly built transcontinental railroad and other areas of the Columbia Valley.
The provincial government refused to allow the diversion. However, Baillie-Grohman was able to obtain ownership of large areas of land in the Kootenay region, provided he engaged in certain forms of economic development, including construction of a shipping canal and a lock. The lock was necessary because the Kootenay River was 11 feet higher than the level of the Columbia Lake.
Transport to the canal site.
Baillie-Grohman arranged to have shipped to Golden a large amount of supplies, including complete equipment for a steam-powered sawmill, which was necessary to cut the lumber to build the canal locks and shelters for the workers at the canal. Baillie-Grohman also had hired a complement of workers, including a skilled millwright, to build the sawmill and supervise construction of the canal. Unfortunately when the time came to transport the supplies and the people by water to Canal Flats, "Duchess", then the only steamer available, was then sunk in the deepest part of the river up to her smokestack. 
River transport was the only way Baillie-Grohman could move the heavy sawmill and construction equipment the 124 miles to Canal Flats. The provincial government required Baillie-Grohman to complete the canal by the summer of 1889, then two years in the future. If he did not finish the canal on time, he would not receive the land far downstream. With "Duchess" under water and no other transport in sight, the clock was running on Baillie-Grohman's dream. There was at this time in Golden a man named Jack Hayes who had collected the pieces of a potential steamboat. These included an unpowered heavy-duty railroad construction barge, a vertical boiler from a Manitoba steam plow, and machinery salvaged from an old tugboat. Hayes however lacked the skill to assemble these components into a steamboat. Baillie-Grohman's only option was to task his millwright to help Jack Hayes complete the "Clive".
"Clive" was much too heavy for the shallows of the Columbia River, which were often choked with snags, that is, dead trees which had become lodged in the bed of the river. Snags could block navigation or sink a vessel that might strike them. Under these conditions, it took "Clive" 23 days to cover the 100 miles from Golden to the point upriver where the sawmill could be unloaded.
Construction of the canal and locks.
As was common for construction projects in western North America at that time, the hard labor of building the canal was done by Chinese immigrant laborers. According to E.M. Sandilands, who worked on the canal, the project was fatally defective from the start, because nothing in the stipulations between Baillie-Grohman and the provincial government required Baillie-Grohman to dredge or prepare the approaches to the canal. All Baillie-Grohman had to do was build the canal and locks . However, without proper approaches, it would be near-to-useless. 
When these were completed, and after a ceremony enhanced by what Sandiland described as "a canoe well laden with the 'good cheer' demanded by such an occasion", Sandiland was ordered by the foreman to break out the false dam which had been keeping the Kootenay River from flooding the works. With the aid of another worker he did so, and thus became, as he later realized, the man who made the entire Selkirk and Purcell mountain range into an island. With the canal in place, this entire huge alpine region was completely encircled by the Columbia River, the Arrow Lakes, the Kootenay Lake and River, and finally the canal itself.
Size and cost.
When on July 29, 1889 complete, the canal was 
Limited use of canal.
Despite its cost, the Baillie-Grohman canal was only transited three times by steam-powered vessels.
In 1893, Armstrong built "Gwendoline" at Hansen's Landing on the Kootenay River, and took the vessel through the canal north to the shipyard at Golden to complete her fitting out. By this time it appears that the canal had been damaged or deteriorated to the boat where at least some of the transit of "Gwendoline" had to be accomplished by pulling the vessel out of the water, partially dismantling the boat, and pulling her along on rollers. Over the winter, Armstrong, it is reported, was able to prevail on the provincial government to expend funds to repair the canal. In late May 1894 Armstrong returned the completed "Gwendoline" back to the Kootenay River, this time transiting normally the rehabilitated canal.
From 1892 to 1898, steamboats transported ore from the mines in the southern part of the Rocky Mountain Trench down the Kootenay River to Jennings Montana. In the fall of 1898, railroads were completed in this area which put the three surviving steamboats out of business, and for the most part they were little used after that. Armstrong, the dominant personality in river transport in the East Kootenay region, had been away steamboating on the Stikine River as part of the Klondike Gold Rush. With no work for "North Star" on the upper Kootenay with he returned, Armstrong decided in 1902 to bring the vessel through the Baillie-Grohman canal to be worked on the Columbia river side of the trench. It took a month to move "North Star" through the sloughed-in canal. Among other problems, "North Star" was 130 feet long, 30 feet longer than the lock. Armstrong solved this problem by ripping out the lock gates, building cofferdams out of ore sacks filed with sand, then blowing out the lower coffer dam with dynamite.
Deterioration of the works.
Whatever commercial value the canal may have had was completely wiped out by the dynamite-aided transit of the "North Star". The remains of the canal and the lock gradually deteriorated In 1920, when the journalist-adventurer Lewis R. Freeman visited Canal Flats, he could see traces of the canal running in from Columbia Lake which came to a sharp stop at a collapsing wall of rotting logs, which Freeman believed must have been the remnants of one of the lock gates. M.J. Lorraine, a retired civil engineer, found, photographed and diagrammed a similar situation in 1922.
Failure of the Baillie-Grohman development scheme.
Although Baillie-Grohman had completed the canal on time, or at least could claim he had done so, his plan for acquiring ownership of the Creston area failed when the provincial government was found to have exceeded its authority when it entered into the bargain with Baillie-Grohman.

Bǎ construction

The "bǎ" construction is a grammatical construction in the Chinese language. In a "bǎ" construction, the object of a verb is placed after the function word "bă", and the verb placed after the object, forming a subject–object–verb (SOV) sentence. Linguists commonly analyze "bǎ" as a light verb construction, or as a preposition.
Formation.
Charles Li and Sandra Thompson (1981) offer the following examples of the "bǎ" construction:
Usage.
The "bǎ" construction may only be used in certain contexts, generally those in which the verb expresses "disposal" of, or action upon, the object. According to Wang Li, "the disposal form states how a person is handled, manipulated, or dealt with; how something is disposed of; or how an affair is conducted," or, in other words, "what happens to" the object. Therefore, it is generally used with verbs that are high in transitivity, a property that describes the effect a verb has on its object; "bǎ" does not occur grammatically with verbs that express states or emotions, such as "love" and "miss," or with verbs that express activities that have no effect on the direct object, such as "sing" and "see."
The direct object of a "bǎ" construction must meet certain requirements as well. It is usually definite, meaning that it is specific and unique (as in phrases beginning with the equivalent of "this", "that", "these", or "those"). It may sometimes also be generic, such as "salt" in the sentence "She sometimes eats salt thinking it's sugar." The object of a "bǎ" construction is nearly always something that both the speaker and hearer know about and are aware of.
Research.
Because of the numerous constraints on the kinds of words that may be used in "bǎ" construction, this construction has often been used in studies on language processing and on grammaticality judgments of native speakers. For example, sentences with "bǎ" construction that have syntactic violations (such as "bǎ" being followed by a verb rather than a noun) and semantic violations (such as "bǎ" being followed by a verb that doesn't express "disposal") have been used to study the interaction of syntactic and semantic processing in the brain using the neuroimaging technique of ERP, and to evaluate construction grammar's model of meaning-building.

2008 NCAA Division I baseball season

The 2008 NCAA Division I baseball season, play of college baseball in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level, began on February 22, 2008. The season was the first to have a uniform start date for both southern and northern teams. The change from previous seasons, in which weather allowed southern teams to begin play weeks before northern teams, was an attempt to improve parity between warm-weather and cold-weather teams. The season progressed through the regular season, many conference tournaments and championship series, and concluded with the 2008 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament and 2008 College World Series. The College World Series, which consisted of the eight remaining teams in the NCAA Tournament, was held in its annual location of Omaha, Nebraska at Rosenblatt Stadium. It concluded on June 25, 2008, with the final game of the best of three championship series. Fresno State defeated Georgia two games to one to claim their first championship. Fresno State was the first team seeded fourth in its regional tournament to win a national championship since the NCAA Tournament adopted the current 64-team format in 1999.
Realignment.
New programs.
Five new programs joined Division I baseball for the 2008 season, four from the NCAA Division II. Florida Gulf Coast, previously a Division II independent; North Carolina Central, previously of the Division II Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association; Presbyterian, previously of the Division II South Atlantic Conference; and South Carolina Upstate, previously of the Division II Peach Belt Conference, all made the transition to Division I. The fifth new program, Houston Baptist, joined Division I from the NAIA.
Conference changes.
Entering the 2008 baseball season, the Mid-Continent Conference was renamed The Summit League. The renamed conference was one of several conferences to make membership changes.
Both the renamed Summit League and the Atlantic Sun Conference added multiple members. The Summit added three schools, IPFW, North Dakota State, and South Dakota State, all previously Division I independents. The Atlantic Sun added two schools, Florida Gulf Coast and South Carolina Upstate, both from Division II.
Both the Big West Conference, which added UC Davis from the Division I independent ranks, and the Horizon League, which added Valparaiso from the Mid-Continent, added a single member.
Three schools joined the Division I independent ranks. Le Moyne left the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference to become an independent, and both North Carolina Central and Presbyterian became independents after their transitions from Division II.

List of countries by GNI (nominal, Atlas method) per capita

This is a list of countries by Gross National Income per capita in 2012 at nominal values, according to the Atlas Method, an indicator of income developed by the World Bank. 
Methodology.
The GNI per capita is the dollar value of a country’s final income in a year, divided by its population. It reflects the average income of a country’s citizens.
Knowing a country’s GNI per capita is a good first step toward understanding the country’s economic strengths and needs, as well as the general standard of living enjoyed by the average citizen. A country’s GNI per capita tends to be closely linked with other indicators that measure the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the country and its people. For example, generally people living in countries with higher GNI per capita tend to have longer life expectancies, higher literacy rates, better access to safe water, and lower infant mortality rates.
All data are in United States dollars. Rankings shown are those given by the World Bank. Non-sovereign entities or other special groupings are marked in italics.
