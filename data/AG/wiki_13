Marx's notebooks on the history of technology

Karl Marx wrote a number of notebooks on the history of technology. Their whereabouts were not known but in the past they were read and discussed by Marxist writers. Dr Amy Wendling's recent study "Karl Marx on Technology and Alienation" may have had access to them.
György Lukács studied these notebooks while they existed in the archives in Moscow, and appears to refer to them in a 1925 article later published in English translation in the "New Left Review", no. 39, September/October 1966 criticizing what he saw as Bukharin's undue technicism.
Engels lists Marx's collection of material on technology as one of Marx's "specialisms" in correspondence outlining their mutual division of intellectual labour. 
Marx directly refers to the notebooks in his letter to Engels of January 28, 1863 where he says … I have re-read my notebooks (extracts) on technology, and am attending a practical (only experimental) course for workers on the same by Professor Willis (in Jermyn Street, the Institute for Geology, where Huxley also gave his lectures)… While re-reading the technological-historical excerpts, I came to the conclusion that , apart from the invention of gun-powder, the compass and printing - these necessary pre-requisites for bourgeois development - from the 16th to the mid-18th centuries, i.e. the period of the development of manufacture from craftsmanship until really large-scale industry, the two material foundations on which were based the preparations for mechanised industry within manufacturing were the "clock" and the mill … 
Across his writing Marx makes frequent reference to his interest in technological developments, and these mentions are complemented by generic statements such as the need for a critical history of technology in the major footnote at the beginning of the chapter on "Machinery and Large Scale Industry" in "Capital, Volume I".
Nathan Rosenberg wrote an essay on "Marx as a student of technology" published in his "Inside the Black Box".

Jan Smeets

Jan Smeets (born April 5, 1985, Leiden) is a Dutch chess grandmaster. He was the Dutch champion in 2008. In 2009 he did not take part, but in 2010 he successfully reclaimed the title.
Competitive beginnings.
Taught by his father at the age of six, he quickly progressed to being a regular on the youth tournament circuit, both nationally and internationally. While he found medals hard to come by at world and European level, he was practically unstoppable in domestic competition, taking gold medals in a number of age categories: Under-14 champion in 1998, Under-16 champion in 2000 and Under-20 champion in 2002 (the latter being shared with Erwin l'Ami).
His best performance at the World Junior Chess Championship occurred in 2005, when he took fifth place.
Lifestyle and chess style.
Smeets, who hails from the Oegstgeest suburb of Leiden, tried for a year to become a full-time chess professional. However, along with friend and fellow grandmaster Jan Werle, he found that the lifestyle was not to his liking. Relentless study at the chessboard can be a lonely existence and he considered the ‘dead times’ between chess events to be lacking any element of fun. Consequently, he became a student of Economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam and included only as much chess study as his schedule allowed.
He finds it difficult to define his chess style, but reflecting on past performances, recalls relying too heavily on tricks and playing aggressively. While this may have cost him a few first places, he describes his lack of nerves as a real asset, helping him gain many extra points and half points at the critical stages of matches and tournaments.
Playing record.
2004 was the year that his participation in senior tournaments began to yield encouraging results. He finished in second place in Gouda (after Daniel Fridman) and gained the Grandmaster title the same year. At Dos Hermanas the following year, he shared third behind Fridman and Bu Xiangzhi (with Sergey Volkov) and at the 2005 Hengelo Stork Young Masters event, he finished one-half point behind the Russian grandmaster Alexander Riazantsev. This was a year of significant breakthrough for Smeets, when he recorded one of his best performances at Wijk aan Zee's Corus 'B' tournament, finishing equal with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov for a share of second place, behind Teimour Radjabov. Left in his wake were a multitude of other strong players, including Peter Heine Nielsen, Ivan Cheparinov, Alexander Onischuk, Magnus Carlsen and Predrag Nikolić. 
He played successfully at the Essent Open in Hoogeveen in 2007, finishing once more as runner-up, this time with Friso Nijboer, Jan Werle and Evgeny Postny, behind surprise winner Eltaj Safarli. In 2008, there were a number of excellent results; he was the winner of the Dutch Championship at Hilversum and finished third at the Howard Staunton Memorial Tournament, after Michael Adams and Loek van Wely, but ahead of Jan Timman, Ivan Sokolov and Nigel Short. He took a share of fifth place at the EU Individual Open Chess Championship, was selected to represent the Netherlands at the Dresden Olympiad and shared second place in the four player Essent (Crown Group) Tournament, after Ivan Sokolov and equal with former World Junior Champion Ahmed Adly. It was also a year in which his Elo rating broke through the 2600 barrier. In 2010 Smeets won the Dutch Championship for the second time.
Smeets is a very keen player of team chess and competes in the national leagues of Germany (for Bundesliga team Solingen SG 1868), Belgium and the Netherlands (where he drew with former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik).

Zsámbék

Zsámbék () is a town in Pest County, in Hungary.
Settings.
Zsámbék is located 30 km west of Budapest along the M1 motorway in the Gerecse Mountains. Its neighbouring villages are Tök, Perbál, Páty, Herceghalom, Mány, Bicske, and Szomor.
History.
Zsámbék has been inhabited since Paleolithic times. It has seen Celtic, Roman and Avar populations throughout its history, according to archaeological finds. A Celtic coach's remains were found there as well as a bronze trumpet. 
In the 1050s the wife of Béla III of Hungary, who was the sister of the French king, gave the village to a knight named Aynard. The Aynard family built the Premonstratensian church beginning in 1220.
The church was destroyed in 1241 during the Mongolian invasions. Following the destruction, during the reign of Béla IV of Hungary, the church and monastery were rebuilt. Positioned at an important merchant route — halfway between Esztergom and Székesfehérvár and near Buda — the village underwent rapid growth. 
In 1467 Matthias Corvinus granted the rights of a borough. He also gave the fortress to his son, John Corvinus.
In 1541, Turkish troops occupied the fortress and held it for 145 years. During this occupation, they also built a Turkish bath, the ruins of which are still visible in the village.
In 1686 general János Bottyán fought there against the Turks. Later the Zichy family became the landowners of the region. They then rebuilt the castle.
An earthquake in 1763 ruined the church once again. It was not reconstructed after this horrific event. Settlers from Germany, who came to live in the abandoned village after the Turkish occupation, took the stones from the church and used them for building houses and fences. Many of the church's stones are still present in the walls of older houses.

Buckpool Golf Club

Buckpool Golf Club is located in Buckie, Moray on the Moray Firth coast of Scotland. This 18 hole course is set out on a clifftop location at the extreme western end of Buckpool. UK Golf Guide describes it as a "links course with superlative view over Moray Firth"
The course was created in the 1930s and part of the purpose of the project was to create jobs in a time of high unemployment, especially in the herring fishing industry. Golf website St Andrews.com [http://golf.standrews.com/course-directory/course-details.asp?club=71&txtKeyword=&cboCountry=94&cboCounty=-1&cboCourseType=3&rdoResultType=rich&cboRecordPerPage=10&cboSortOrder=courseName] describes Buckpool thus whilst reflecting on its origins as a job creation scheme, "for a course of this quality some of today's multi-millionaire course designers would be shaking in their soft-spikes if such schemes were resurrected." In the early sixties the Town Council, which had maintained both Buckpool and Buckie’s other course Strathlene decided to close Buckpool due to economic reasons. A group of enthusiasts formed a private club and leased the course which has come a long way from the old farmhouse which was the clubhouse to the present building situated besides the 10th and 18th greens. In 1999 the land was purchased from Moray Council by the members.
Buckpool provides a full calendar of tournaments throughout the season for both Ladies and Gents sections and regular competition for Seniors and Juniors as well.
Today the course plays to a par of 70 and is 6127 yards in length.
Buckpool Golf Club is notable as being the venue for Paul Lawrie's maiden professional tournament victory when he won the 1986 Moray Seafoods Open which was, incidentally, his first ever tournament as a pro.

M139 bomblet

The M139 bomblet was a U.S. sub-munition designed for use in warheads as a chemical cluster bomb. Each bomblet held of sarin nerve agent.
History.
In 1964, a new warhead size was standardized for the 318 mm Honest John rocket. The warhead held 52 M139 bomblets. When the MGM-29 Sergeant was deployed in the 1960s, it had the capacity to deliver a warhead carrying 330 M139 bomblets. Subsequent missile systems, including the Pershing missile, had the capability to carry warheads with the M139 inside. In total, about 60,000 M139s were produced and stored; almost all were destroyed between April and November 1976.
Specifications.
The M139 was a spherical bomblet that was filled with of sarin (GB). On the outside of the device were "vanes"; the vanes created a spin which armed the impact fuze. This "spin-to-arm" type fuze required between 1,000 and 2,000 rotations per minute to arm, which made handling the bomblets simpler because they were insensitive to normal movements. The bomblet's interior contained a central explosive burster charge, containing of composition B, and two outer compartments which contained the sarin.
Tests involving the M139.
The M139 bomblet was used by the U.S. Army in at least two instances of chemical weapons testing. In 1967 there were two series of tests which sought to learn the effects of Sarin dropped in the bomblets over two different types of forest environment. The first series of tests, known as Green Mist, took place March 25–April 24, 1967. Conducted in Hawaii, the purpose of the tests was to ascertain the effect of Sarin-filled M139s being dropped and disseminated over a canopy rain forest. The Hawaii tests used both sarin nerve agent and the simulant methylacetoacetate.
Another test using the M139 took place at the Gerstle River test site, near Fort Greely, Alaska, from June to July 1967. The purpose of these tests was to determine the effectiveness of Sarin-filled M139 and BLU-19/B23 bomblets when dropped from a SADEYE dispenser in a summer forest environment. The tests were collectively known as "Dew Point". Both 1967 testing operations were overseen by the U.S. Army's Deseret Test Center. Both M139 tests were part of Project 112.

Curtain wall (fortification)

A curtain wall is the defensive wall surrounding the bailey of a medieval castle. It can also be a defensive wall between two bastions of a castle or fortress in post-medieval fortifications.
In earlier designs of castles the curtain walls were often built to a considerable height and were fronted by a ditch or moat to make assault difficult. 
Later with the introduction of trace italienne fortifications the height of the curtain walls was reduced and beyond the ditch additional outworks such as ravelins and tenailles were added to protect the curtain walls from direct cannonading.

"Ave Maria" had been recorded and released as a single in 1982, it was also included on the 2CD set "Save The Children - Christmas Carols and Festive Songs" in 1988. 
"A Winter's Tale" was written by Wombles producer Mike Batt and Paige's then partner, lyricist Tim Rice and had been originally recorded by David Essex. Rice also contributed a voiceover as Santa on the final track. Tommy Körberg who, in 1986, was starring alongside Paige in the London production of "Chess" performed the Bing Crosby part on "Peace On Earth/Little Drummer Boy".

<doc id="20180702" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20180702" title="GWR 102 La France">
GWR 102 La France

La France, number 102, was a locomotive of the Great Western Railway. It was bought by G.J. Churchward to evaluate French locomotive practice, and particularly the effect of compounding.
History.
George Jackson Churchward, on succeeding William Dean as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Great Western Railway (GWR), planned the introduction of a series of locomotives designed to tackle the South Devon Banks. Churchward looked at the best practice from both Europe and America, and was impressed by the performance of the de Glehn compounds running on the Nord railway in France. A single locomotive, built specifically for the GWR by Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques on the de Glehn principles was delivered in October 1903. This locomotive was numbered 102 and named "La France" although the makers plates had to be moved from the cabside to the front splasher to allow the number to be fitted in the usual GWR position.
Description.
"La France" was visibly not a GWR engine, although fitted with a Swindon chimney and paired with a standard tender, as immediately recognisable from firebox and the cab. Initially the locomotive was painted black, looking more LNWR than GWR, but she was repainted in 1905 into the standard GWR green livery. In contrast to previous GWR practice, "La France" had two high pressure cylinders fitted between the frames, and two low pressure cylinders outside. The high pressure cylinders drove the front driving wheels while the low pressure cylinders drove the rear driving wheels. Also notable was the external steam pipe mounted just in front of the dome, and looking rather similar in appearance to a top feed.
Operation.
"La France" was put to work on important expresses in order to fully evaluate it in operation, and worked turn and turn about with GWR 4-4-0 express locos such as the City class and Atbara class. No.102 hauled the inaugural down Cornish Riviera Express from Paddington on 1 July 1904, this becoming a regular turn which required a non-stop run to Plymouth. In 1913 a top feed and new steam pipes were fitted, and then in 1916 the boiler was replaced by a GWR standard No.1 boiler. In 1926, along with two other French locomotives 103 "President" and 104 "Alliance", 102 was based at Oxford shed. "La France" was withdrawn in October 1926 having achieved 728,031 miles.
In practice, "La France" did not provide any significant improvement in either performance or economy compared to No 171 "Albion", Churchwards prototype 4-6-0 which was converted to a 4-4-2 specifically for comparison with the French locomotive. Some other benefits were found, however, particularly a much smoother ride and also a reduction in the loads on the rods and axleboxes due to the drive being split between the two driving axles. Despite being remembered for not changing Churchward's views about using a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement for his locomotives, and failing to demonstrate the claimed significant benefits of compounding, La France did leave a lasting legacy on British steam locomotive design. Churchward adopted the de Glehn bogie design for his locomotives, and its success endured with its use by William Stanier on the LMS and subsequently by Robert Riddles on the BR standard designs. It also found its way onto Southern Railway locomotives.

Jarosekas Quartet

The Jarosekas Quartet was the most popular Lithuanian music group of the 1940s.
The Jarosekas Quartet was initially formed in May 1940 as an offshoot of the Kaunas University men's choir. The 2 initiating members were Liudas Jarošekas and V. Baranauskas. Also part of the initial group were J. P. Nasvytis, J. Deltuva and A. Matukonis. Shortly thereafter V. Baranauskas left the group, most likely due to conflicts between the two leaders. This was soon followed by a rapid change of the group's composition until Liudas Jarošekas, Vytautas Žmuidzinas, Algirdas Matukonis, Aleksas Paulionis and Jurgis Dauknys stabilized the group's foundation.
The first public performance took place in September 1940 in a Kaunas high school. Until August 1941 the group mainly gave concerts together with the men's choir of Kaunas University. From September 1941 up through the Soviet invasion of Lithuania in May 1944 the group gave nearly weekly live radio concerts through the main Lithuanian radio station, based in the then capital of Lithuania, Kaunas.
The group was most often accompanied by their "koncertmeister" Jurgis Dauknys, and they were also accompanied by the Radiofonas radio orchestra, directed by J. Lechavičius. Sometimes they had guest performers at their concerts from the Lithuanian National Theater, which included soloists - A. Kučingis, J. Mažeika, V. Jonuškaitė-Zaunienė. At times they were joined by the very popular crooner Antanas Šabaniauskas and akordeonist Četkauskas. In concerts, which took place in large halls, they were sometimes joined by the popular humorist, actor and director Stasys Čaikauskas to give the audience a pause between songs.
The group was extremely popular from their start and continued their success in Lithuania until the Soviet invasion of Lithuania towards the end of World War II. With the pending arrival of the Soviet army, Liudas Jarošekas and most of the group fled to Germany where they quickly regrouped and continued their great success until 1949. While in Germany they not only gave concerts to the Lithiuanian expat communities in Western Europe, but also concerts for general audiences in such places as the Dresden State Theater. With part of the group again reforming in the early 1950s in Chicago, they continued to give limited concerts in the USA and Canada well into the 1960s.
In the early part of their career, the songs performed were mainly in the style of popular western music of the times. As time passed, half the program was Lithuanian folk songs and patriotic songs. In their final days in Lithuania prior to the end of World War II, in their larger concerts, more complex and highly arranged songs and a few arias from operas, were included. In their period in Lithuania from 1940 - 1944 their repertoire included over 40 different songs.
Main members of the group.
Liudas Jarošekas - Founder and second tenor
Vytautas Žmuidzinas - Lead tenor
Algirdas Matukonis - Baritone
Aleksas Paulionis - Bass
Jurgis Dauknys - Accompanist

Millmerran railway line

The Millmerran railway line is a 71 kilometre long branch railway in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia. 
History.
Parliament approved a line to link Pittsworth with the east via the southern line from Toowoomba in October 1885. 
The line branches off the Southern line in the township of Wyreema (then called Beauaraba) 17 km south of the major regional city of Toowoomba and opened on 19 September 1887. The Southern line branched from Gowrie Junction until the opening of the Drayton Deviation from Toowoomba direct to Wyreema in 1915.
Stops were constructed en route to Pittsworth at The Hollows, Umbriam, Southbrook, Green Hills and Broxburn.
An extension to the agricultural centre of Millmerran via Murlaggan, Yarranlea, Cecilvale, Brookstead, Pampas and Yandilla was approved in November 1909 and opened for business on 18 October 1911. Much of the line closely parallels the Gore Highway.
Grain traffic was substantial and has been the branch lifeblood all along. A rail motor service operated between 1928 and 1969. As occurred elsewhere, road transport took over much of the business with the result that only spasmodic grain transport remains.
Current line standards.
The line is laid with 30kg/m rail with an axle load of 15.75 tonnes. The maximum grade is 1 in 50 (2%) and the minimum radius curves are 160m. The line speed is 50km/h to Brookstead, and 30km/h beyond.

Profanity in science fiction

Profanity in science fiction (SF) shares all of the issues of profanity in fiction in general, but has several unique aspects of its own, including the use of alien profanities (such as the alien expletive "shazbot!" from "Mork & Mindy", a word that briefly enjoyed popular usage outside of that television show).
Extent of usage.
In his advice to other SF writers, Orson Scott Card states that there are no hard-and-fast rules for the use of profanity in SF stories, despite what may have been expected of writers in the past. The onus is squarely on the writer to determine how much profanity to use, to enquire as to each publisher's limits, and to think about the effect that the use of profanity will have on the reader, both in perceiving the characters and in possibly being offended by the story as a whole.
Card urges those writers who do decide to omit profanity from their stories to omit it completely. He regards the coinage of "tanj" ("There Ain't No Justice") by Larry Niven as a "noble experiment" that "proved that euphemisms are often worse than the crudities that they replace", because they make the story look silly. In Card's opinion, such nonce words simply don't work.
Ruth Wajnryb shares this opinion, stating that "tanj" or "flarn" don't work as profanities because they are not real, and are "just a futile attempt to give clean-cut stories some foul-mouthed action".
Jes Battis observes, in contrast, that the use of "frell" and "dren" in "Farscape" allowed the television series to get away with dialogue that would normally never have made it past broadcasting and network censorship. The words are respectively equivalent to "fuck" and "shit" and are used as both interjections and nouns in the series. In the episode "Suns and Lovers", for example, Aeryn Sun says "frell me dead!" as an exclamation of surprise, much as a real-world person would utter "well, fuck me!" or, indeed, "fuck me dead!" Battis also notes that "Firefly" used a similar strategy, by using Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese for all profanities, also using the word "gorram" as a replacement for "god damn", a phrase usually considered to be highly profane. Likewise, dialogue in "Babylon 5" is liberally peppered with the words "frag" ('fuck') and the Narn word "Shrock" ('shit').
Similarly, invented expletives are used throughout the Star Wars Expanded Universe. For example, the Alderaanian expletive "stang" was introduced in the 1978 novel "Splinter of the Mind's Eye" and subsequently used in "Star Wars" novels, comic books, and games. Also, "Star Wars" authors commonly use the Huttese curse "fierfek", first introduced in a short story published in the 1996 anthology "Tales from Jabba's Palace", and the Corelian curse "sithspawn", first introduced in the 1994/1995 comic book series "Dark Empire II".
Parke Godwin opines that excessive profanity, as a part of naturalistic dialogue, "dulls much modern fiction and too many films" and states it to be a pitfall for novice writers, or for writers who never grow up, to fall into. He states that it is a "lazy copout that no longer frightens horses in the street, merely annoys and ultimately bores an intelligent reader". He advises writers that "less is more", and that if it really is the right thing for a character to be salty, it should be made clear to the reader why, observing as an example that in his science fiction novel "Limbo Search" the profanity used by character Janice Tyne is a symptom of her fear and tension, caused by being burned out at age 27 and afraid of the future.
Wanda Raiford observes that the use of the nonce word "frak" in both "Battlestar Galactica" series is "an indispensable part of the naturalistic tone that show strives to achieve", noting that it, and "toaster" (a racial epithet for Cylons), allow the show to use obscene and racialist dialogue that no real-life educated American adult would consider using the real-life equivalents of in polite company. She compares the racial hatred associated with the use of "nigger" (an utterance of which she states to have preceded and accompanied "every lynching of a black person in America") to the racial hatred of the Cylons, by the humans, that the use of such phrases as "frakking toasters" indicates in the series. She also observes that several of the characters, including Gaius Baltar, are "frakking toaster lovers".
In the series of novels by Peter David, the principal protagonist, Captain Mackenzie Calhoun, frequently utters the word "grozit", a curse from his home world of Xenex. It is understood to be the equivalent to "shit".
The 2005 video game "" also used "fierfek", the expletive popular in the "Star Wars" franchise. This word is described in-universe as being an alien loan-word originally meaning 'poison', but has been adopted by the game's special forces protagonists as a curse word to make the illusion of playing as commandos more believable.
Fictional profanities.
Profanity in SF also encompasses the idea of things that "alien cultures" might find profane, and the notion that what non-humans and humans find to be profane may differ markedly. Card observes that human profanity encompasses words dealing with sexual intercourse and waste excretion, and states that that tells one something about human beings. He proceeds to suggest that what aliens might find to be profane can be a useful tool for suggesting the alienness of a culture. The first example of this that he gives are alien cultures that have no trouble with words about sexual intercourse, but that find words to do with "eating" to be profane. "" made use of this concept in the episode "Vox Sola". The second example Card provides is that of alien cultures where the idea of property ownership is considered to be as obscene as pederasty. Douglas Adams's "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" at one point mentions that the word Belgium is the worst profanity in the galaxy. 
In other contexts.
As mentioned above, "shazbot" briefly enjoyed popular usage outside of its television show. "Battlestar Galactica"s "frak", a word that Lee Goldberg characterizes as "something truly amazing and subversive" and that Scott Adams calls "pure genius", has also escaped its original context. Originally spelled "frack", it along with "felgercarb" were coined by writer Glen A. Larson for the 1978 "Battlestar Galactica", for much the same reasons that "frell" and "dren" were coined for "Farscape": the ability to use profane dialogue, with words that would be immediately understood as synonymous with the real profanities that they stood in for, without falling foul of network censorship and broadcasting restrictions accompanying its original Sunday evening broadcast timeslot.
The producers re-spelled the word "frak" for the 2004 "Battlestar Galactica" series, in order to make it, literally, a four-letter word; the word appears in several Black Library novels before then, most notably the Ciaphas Cain series. It has escaped, in both forms, from the series to a whole variety of other contexts, from a "Dilbert" cartoon strip where Dilbert mutters it, through other television shows including "The Office", "Gossip Girl", "Veronica Mars", "30 Rock", and "Scrubs", and Robert Crais' Elvis Cole novel "Chasing Darkness", to everyday spoken use.
The BBC Two science fiction television series "Red Dwarf" replaces most of its characters' profanities with invented terms, mainly "smeg" (possibly a truncation of "smegma") and its compound "smeg-head". Other common insults are "goit" and "gimboid".
In "Lilo and Stitch", the character Gantu often uses the word "blitznak" in place of an obscenity. In "Leroy and Stitch", it is implied that "blitznak" may refer to fecal matter.

Soviet annexation of the western Ukrainian territories

On the basis of a secret clause of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (USSR), the Soviet Union invaded Poland on September 17, 1939, capturing the eastern regions of Poland (Kresy), with Galicia and Volhynia, facing little Polish opposition and occupying the principal city of the ethnic region Western Ukraine, Lviv (), on September 22 of that year. On June 26, 1940 Moscow issued an ultimatum to the kingdom of Romania demanding ceding of the territories in the region of northern Bukovina (where Ukrainians were the ethnic majority), which was occupied by the Red Army on August 2 of that year. As a result of these annexations the territory of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic gained of territory and increased its population by over 7 million people.
Annexation of Polish territory.
On September 17, 1939 the Red Army entered Polish territory, acting on the basis of a secret clause of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Soviet Union would later deny the existence of this secret protocol, claiming that it was never allied with Nazi Germany, and acted independently to "protect" the Ukrainian and Belorusan minorities in the disintegrating Polish state. Composed of mostly ethnic Ukrainian Soviet troops under the command of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, the Soviet forces occupied Western Ukraine within 12 days, capturing the regions of Galicia and Volhynia with little Polish opposition and occupying the principal city, Lviv, on September 22 of that year.
Due to Polish government's discrimination against the Ukrainian minority during the interbellum, these troops were sometimes greeted with genuine joy by Ukrainian villagers, In other cases, support demonstrations were staged by pro-Soviet militia. Not all Ukrainians, however, trusted the Soviet regime responsible for the Ukrainian Famine of 1932–1933. In practice, the poor generally welcomed the Soviets, while the elites tended to join the opposition, despite supporting the unification of Ukraine.
Immediately after entering Poland's territory, the Soviet army helped to set up "provisional administrations" in the cities and "peasant committees" in the villages in order to organize one-list elections to the People's Assembly of Western Ukraine. The elections were designed to give the annexation an appearance of validity, but were far from free or fair. The voters had a choice of only one candidate, often a local communist or someone sent to western Ukraine from Sоviet Ukraine for each position of deputy; the communist party commissars then provided the assembly with resolutions that would push through nationalization of banks and heavy industry and transfers of land to peasant communities. Elections took place on October 22, 1939; the official numbers reported participation of 93 percent of the electorate, 91 percent of whom supported the appointed candidates. Based on these results, the People's Assembly of Western Ukraine, headed by Kyryl Studynsky (a prominent academic and figure in the Christian Social Movement), consisted of 1,484 deputies. They met in Lviv on October 26–28, where they were addressed by Nikita Khrushchev and other representatives of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The assembly voted unanimously to thank Stalin for liberation and sent a delegation headed by Studynsky to Moscow to ask for formal inclusion of the territories into the Ukrainian SSR. The Supreme Soviet voted to do so on November 1, 1939 and on November 15 a law was passed making Western Ukraine a part of the Ukrainian SSR.
Annexation of Romanian territory.
On June 26, 1940, Soviet People's Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov presented an ultimatum note to Gheorghe Davidescu, Romanian ambassador to Moscow, in which the Soviet Union demanded the evacuation of the Romanian military and administration from Bessarabia and from the northern part of Bukovina within 24 hours, The Soviet government demanded the northern part of Bukovina as a ""minor reparation for the great loss inflicted to the Soviet Union and Bessarabia's population by 22 years of Romanian domination of Bessarabia"", and because its ""[...] fate is linked mainly with the Soviet Ukraine by the community of its historical fate, and by the community of language and ethnic composition"". Northern Bukovina has had some historical connections with Galicia, which was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939, in the sense that both were part of Austria-Hungary from the second part of the 18th century until 1918. Also, unlike Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina had a Ukrainian majority. Romania promptly agreed to withdraw from the territories, to avoid a full scale military conflict. Majority of the territories were turned into the Moldavian SSR, a constituent republic of the USSR.
Soviet policies in the annexed territories.
Government and administration.
The lands annexed by the Soviet Union were administratively reorganized into six oblasts similar to those in the rest of the Soviet Union (Drohobych Oblast, Lviv Oblast, Rivne Oblast, Stanislav (later known as Ivano-Frankivsk) Oblast, Tarnopil Oblast and Volyn Oblast). The civilian administration in those regions annexed from Poland was organized by December 1939 and was drawn mostly from newcomers from eastern Ukraine and Russia; only 20% of government employees were from the local population. It was falsely assumed by many Ukrainians that a disproportionate number of people working for the Soviet administration came from within the Jewish community. The reason for this belief was that most of the previous Polish administrators were deported, and the local Ukrainian intelligentsia who could have taken their place were generally deemed to be too nationalistic for such work by the Soviets. In reality, most positions were staffed by ethnic Ukrainians from the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, in the eyes of many Ukrainians the Jews came to be associated with Soviet rule, which contributed to rising anti-Jewish sentiments.
The Polish language was eliminated from public life, and Ukrainian became the language of the government and the courts. All Polish institutions were abolished, and all Polish officials, civil servants, and police were deported to Siberia or Central Asia.
Ukrainian organizations not controlled by the Soviets were limited or abolished. Hundreds of credit unions and cooperatives that had served the Ukrainian people between the wars were shut down. All local Ukrainian political parties were abolished, and between 20,000 to 30,000 Ukrainian activists, fled to German-occupied territory; most of those who did not escape were arrested. For example, Dr. Dmytro Levitsky, former head of the moderate Ukrainian political party Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance (UNDO) that had dominated Ukrainian political life between the world wars, and chief of the Ukrainian delegation in the pre-war Polish parliament, was arrested alongside many of his colleagues, deported to Moscow, and never heard from again. The elimination of the individuals, organizations and parties that represented moderate or liberal political tendencies left the extremist Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which operated in the underground, as the only political party with a significant organizational presence left in western Ukraine.
Education and healthcare.
Due to the sensitive location of western Ukraine along the border with German-held territory, the Soviet administration made attempts, initially, to gain the loyalty and respect of the Ukrainian population. Healthcare, especially in the villages, was improved dramatically. Between the two world wars Poland had drastically reduced the number of Ukrainian-language schools while Romania had eliminated them completely. These were now reopened and, although the Russian language became a mandatory foreign-language course, the schools were taught in Ukrainian. Ukrainian was reintroduced in the University of Lviv (where the Polish government had banished it during the interwar years), which became thoroughly Ukrainized and renamed after Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko. The Soviet authorities established a branch of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Lviv, and some leading non-Communist Ukrainian scholars were invited to staff these institutions. University students from Eastern Ukraine were brought to Lviv and western Ukrainian students, professors, and other cultural figures were sent on Soviet-funded trips to Kiev. An unintended result of such exchanges was that the Galician youth were disagreeably surprised by the material poverty and widespread use of the Russian language in Soviet Ukraine, while the incoming students to western Ukraine became exposed to and sometimes came to adopt western Ukrainian nationalism. In contrast to the dramatic expansion of educational opportunities within the Soviet system, non-Soviet controlled educational institutions such as the popular Prosvita society reading rooms, the Shevchenko Scientific Society, libraries and community theaters, and the Russophile Stauropegion Institute were closed or abolished.
Land reform.
In the annexed territories, over 50 percent of the land had belonged to Polish or Romanian landlords while approximately 75% of the Ukrainian peasants owned less than two hectares of land per household. Starting in 1939 lands not owned by the peasants were seized and slightly less than half of them were distributed to landless peasants free of charge; the rest were given to new collective farms. The Soviet authorities then began taking land from the peasants themselves and turning it over to collective farms, which affected 13% of western Ukrainian farmland by 1941. This caused the peasants to turn against the Soviet regime.
Religious persecution.
At the time of the Soviet annexation of western Ukraine the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church had approximately 2,190 parishes, three theological seminaries, 29 monasteries, 120 convents and 3.5 million faithful. Its leader, Andrey Sheptytsky, was seen as a "father figure" by most Western Ukrainians. The married Western Ukrainian Clergy and their children formed a caste that had a high degree of influence within Ukrainian society. Using his moral influence, Sheptytsky persuaded all but approximately 100 of the Ukrainian Catholic priests in western Ukrainian to stay with their flock in western Ukraine rather than flee from the Soviet regime. Due to its immense popularity, as well as that of Sheptytsky, among the western Ukrainian people, the Soviet Union did not attempt to abolish the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church nor persecute its leader at that time. Instead, it sought to limit the Church's influence by banishing its presence from schools, preventing it from printing (20 Ukrainian
Catholic journals or newspapers were shut down), confiscating lands from which it derived income, closing monasteries and seminaries, levying high taxes, and introducing anti-religious propaganda into schools and the media. The Soviets also attempted to undermine the Church from within. A prominent Lviv priest and close confidante of Andrey Sheptytsky, Havriil Kostelnyk, who had been the principle critic of the Vatican's Latinization policies and spokesperson for the "Easternizing" trend within the Ukrainian Catholic Church, was asked to organize a "National" Greek Catholic Church, with Soviet support, that would be independent of the Vatican and which would split the faithful in western Ukraine. At this time, he refused to cooperate, even after the autumn of 1940 when the Soviets arrested his youngest son in order to blackmail him. (After Sheptytksy's death, however, Kostelnyk would play a significant role in the destruction of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church). Arrests, though not of a mass nature, were used in order to terrify the religious leaders. For example, in June 1940 the superior of the Studite convent in Lviv, Olena Viter, was imprisoned and tortured in order to "confess" that Sheptytsky was a member of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and that she was supplying him with weapons. She refused to do so. By the summer of 1941, in Western Ukraine 11 or 12 Greek Catholic priests were murdered or missing, and fifty-three were imprisoned or deported.
Despite the various restrictions, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was left as the only remaining independent Ukrainian institution that operated openly in Ukrainian territory. Church attendance soared, and contemporary accounts described churches never having been as full as they became under Soviet rule, with long lines forming in front of confessional booths. The western Ukrainian people attempted to protect their Church from Soviet restrictions. Peasants, even among the poorest ones, were reluctant to accept land taken from the Church and offered to them, and as late as May 1940 some villages had not yet expropriated church lands, while others distributed much of it to priests' families. Priests made homeless were taken in by parishioners. Children, who no longer learned religion in school, obtained religious instruction privately.
The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in Volhynia faced similar restrictions to those of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church; moreover it underwent pressure to subordinate itself to the Moscow Patriarch. Many Orthodox priests fled the Soviet regime, resulting in a large number of newly consecrated priests who were not necessarily fit for their duties, weakening and demoralizing the Church somewhat. The Orthodox hierarchs in western Ukraine were left alone, however.
Deportations and Demographic changes.
Initially, the Soviet authorities deported primarily political figures as well as all Polish officials, civil servants, police, and Polish citizens who had fled from the Germans. The exact number of Poles deported to Siberia or Central Asia between 1939 and 1941 remains unknown, and has been estimated at from under 500,000 to over 1,500,000; about 350,000 of whom died. In Bukovina, in accordance with the agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany, most of the region's large German minority was repatriated. The German consul also evacuated many local Ukrainian leaders and Orthodox priests, many of whom subsequently joined the Melnyk branch of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists abroad. Tens of thousands of German-speaking people from Volhynia were also moved to German-controlled territory.
In April 1940 the Soviet authorities in the annexed territories began to extend their repressive measures towards the general Ukrainian population. This coincided with the removal of Soviet troops of ethnic Ukrainian origin, who had become too friendly with local Ukrainians, and their replacement by soldiers from Central Asia. The Soviet authorities began arresting and deporting anyone suspected of disloyalty to the Soviet regime. In villages, people were denounced by their neighbors, some of whom were Communist sympathizers while others were opportunists. Deportations became indiscriminate, and people and their families were deported for "crimes" such as having relatives or visiting abroad, or visiting friends while the friends were arrested. Because many of those making denunciations were perceived to be Jews, anti-Jewish sentiments among the Ukrainian population increased. Ultimately, between 1939 and the beginning of World War II approximately 500,000 Ukrainians would be deported to Siberia and central Asia. 
In addition to the loss of much of the native population, western Ukraine experienced an influx of other settlers. The population of Lviv increased from 318,000 to 450,000 during the Soviet administration, largely due to the influx of Polish refugees fleeing German territory and Soviet officials and their families. The latter group was estimated to number 100,000 people in Lviv. In Stanislaviv (now Ivano-Frankivsk) the population grew by 40,000, 1,000 of whom were estimated to have been NKVD officers. In addition, 100,000s of Jews fleeing Nazi terror in German-occupied Poland arrived in the territories newly annexed by the USSR.
Aftermath.
On June 22, 1941 Operation Barbarossa began, and western Ukraine was captured within weeks. Prior to retreating, the Soviet authorities, unwilling to evacuate prisoners, chose to kill all inmates whether or not they had committed major or minor crimes and whether or not they were held for political reasons. Estimates of the number of people killed vary from 15,000 to 40,000. Due to the brutality of the Soviet administration, many Ukrainians initially welcomed the German invasion. On June 30, 1941, Ukrainian nationalist commandos under German command captured Lviv which had been evacuated by Soviet forces and declared an independent state allied with Nazi Germany. This movement was quashed by the Germans, who split up western Ukraine. Northern Bukovina was returned to Germany's ally, Romania. Galicia, which had once been part of Austria, was made part of the General Government together with occupied Poland, while Volhynia was split off and attached to the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. All of these regions would be captured and reintegrated into Soviet Ukraine in 1944.
Importance for the Ukrainian statehood.
The annexation of 1939 was an important event in the history of Ukraine, because it brought within one republic most of Ukrainian ethnic territories and unified previously separated Ukrainian populations. Thus the unified during this time Ukrainian SSR eventually achieved independence in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union.

John Halsey (musician)

John Halsey (born 23 February 1945, in Highgate) is a rock drummer, best known for his appearance as Barrington Womble ("Barry Wom") in The Rutles, leading to his playing with Neil Innes's band Fatso and appearing in the television film "All You Need is Cash" (1978).
Halsey was born in Highgate, North London and lived in North Finchley and was in a London based Rhythm and Blues band called Felder's Orioles (1965 – 1968) with Mick O'Brien on bass; Barry Huband on vocals, organ; Paul Hodgson on guitar; Rod Hinkston on baritone saxophone and Peter Newman on tenor saxophone, who released four singles on the Piccadilly Records label between 1965 and 1968. Between 1967 and 1973 he was a member of a band from Southport called Timebox (formed in October 1965) who later became Patto without keyboard player Chris Holmes but with the four members Mike Patto (vocals), Peter "Ollie" Halsall (guitar vibes and vocals), Clive Griffiths (bass and vocals), and Halsey (drums and vocals).
With record producer, Muff Winwood, they released three albums and split up in 1973. The band was critically acclaimed with their own style of music: "it was like rock and roll with the freedom of avant-garde". Ollie Halsall is acclaimed as one of the finest guitar players Britain has ever produced. He died in Madrid in 1992. Mike Patto died in London in 1979.
Phil Collins says that Halsey is one of his major influences as a drummer and acquired his first set of Gretsch drums from him.
In 1972 Halsey played drums on the Lou Reed album "Transformer" and as a session musician performed on many records and albums. He performed on tour with Joe Cocker, The Scaffold, Grimms, Chris Jagger, Neil Innes, Viv Stanshall, Joe Brown and many others.
In an interview he gave in 1992 to the fanzine "Ptolemaic Terrascope", he said he spent most of the 1980s selling fish from the back of a van after a near-fatal accident in May 1983 returning from a Joe Brown show in Chichester in a car being driven by Patto bass player Clive Griffiths (who suffered devastating injuries from which he has never fully recovered). Since then, Halsey has been a pub landlord, first in Suffolk in 1986 and since 1996 at the Castle Inn public house in Castle Street, Cambridge.
In 2001 Halsey appeared as the mystery guest on the BBC 2 comedy show "Never Mind The Buzzcocks".
In 2007 he appeared on the Channel 4 show "What The Pythons Did Next" discussing what it was like to work with Eric Idle and at The Rutles 40 years get together in Los Angeles
in April 2008 where the four original band members played together for the first time ever.

Joe Erwin

Joe Arnold Erwin (born October 23, 1956) is an entrepreneur and politician from South Carolina. He co-founded and is President of Erwin-Penland Advertising, is a former Chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, and co-founded the thought leadership conference Food for Thought in 2008.
Early years.
Erwin was born October 23, 1956 in Florence, South Carolina to Isabel Erwin Kelly and Henry Erwin. Henry died following a brief illness when Joe was 12, and his mother raised Joe and his younger brother Tony. After living in North Carolina and Florida, the Erwins moved to Greenville, South Carolina in 1968 to be closer to family.
Erwin attended public schools and graduated from Eastside High School in Greenville in 1975. At Eastside, he served as student body president, the editorial page editor of the school’s newspaper, and captained the undefeated varsity soccer team. Following graduation, Erwin enrolled at Clemson University. He was an Intramural Debate champion, an International Debate representative, a varsity cheerleader, and in his senior year, the head cheerleader (also known as the “Mic Man”). He was named an NCA All-American in 1978. Erwin graduated from Clemson in 1979 with a B.A. in Political Science.
Joe married Gretchen Getchell Erwin in 1984, and they have two children: Douglas (b. 1988) and Valerie (b. 1990). They live in Greenville, South Carolina and are members of Christ Church Episcopal.
Marketing executive.
Following graduation, Erwin worked at Leslie Advertising in Greenville, initially in the media department and later as an account executive. In 1982 he was recruited to New York to join national agency Benton & Bowles (later DMB&B) to work on the Corning Glass and Quincy’s Family Steakhouse accounts. In addition to account executive duties, Erwin began to write copy–ultimately serving as copywriter for John Madden’s broadcast campaign for Quincy’s. After their marriage in 1984, Gretchen moved to New York and joined the Media Department at Dancer Fitzgerald Sample (later Saatchi & Saatchi).
While in New York, Joe, Gretchen and their friend Allen Bosworth began to talk of returning south to open an agency of their own. Joe and Gretchen purchased Penland Advertising in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1986, renaming the new agency Erwin-Penland. Allen Bosworth remained in New York for two years before joining EP as Director of Client Service in 1988. Joe served as President and Creative Director, while Gretchen led the Media Department.
Since opening in 1986 with one account and one employee, Erwin-Penland has seen expansion. Now with more than 200 employees working across all marketing disciplines, clients include Verizon Wireless, Denny's, Confluence Watersports, Fatz Cafe, ScanSource, Lockheed Martin and BI-LO Supermarkets. Erwin-Penland is a member of the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA’s), and the Intermarket Agency Network.
Erwin-Penland is known for "integrated marketing solutions"–primarily for retail accounts.
Political activity.
While at Clemson, Erwin was a member of College Democrats, and volunteered for a number of campaigns, including future South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn's campaign for Secretary of State, Richard W. Riley’s campaign for governor, and Jimmy Carter’s presidential race. During the 1980s and 1990s, he campaigned for South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges, U.S. Senator Ernest Hollings, South Carolina Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum, and statewide candidates Steve Benjamin and Rick Wade.
Erwin was elected Chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party in 2003, and completed his second two-year term in May 2007. During that time, he negotiated and produced two Democratic presidential debates–one in Greenville in 2003 and one in Orangeburg in 2007–that were broadcast live nationally on NBC. The Greenville debate was the last debate moderated by Tom Brokaw before he left the anchor chair at NBC News. Erwin chose to hold the 2007 debate on the campus of South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, marking the first time a presidential primary debate had been held at an historically black college or university.
Erwin’s four-year chairmanship focused on reorganization at the grassroots level; holding a successful, volunteer-run statewide Democratic presidential primary in 2004; producing the two Democratic presidential debates; and seeking the right for South Carolina to hold its 2008 Democratic presidential primary in the “pre-window” period–as the only primary between the New Hampshire primary and Super Tuesday.
South Carolina competed against 10 other states and the District of Columbia for the early primary designation, and ultimately was chosen by the DNC to join New Hampshire as the only other state with a pre-window primary. The January 2008 Democratic presidential primary, in which South Carolina Democrats turned out in record numbers and outpolled Republicans by more than 88,000 votes, was a watershed event in the 2008 Democratic presidential nominating process. Senator Barack Obama won the primary with 55% of the vote.
When Erwin’s term as chair expired in May 2007, he chose not to seek re-election, but remained involved in politics. During his chairmanship he remained neutral in the primary battle, seeking to engage all voters and help all candidates grow their South Carolina campaigns. In fall 2007, however, he endorsed Senator Barack Obama for president, and campaigned with and for the senator in the months leading up to the January 2008 primary.
Community service.
Erwin is an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award Winner, was inducted into Greenville Tech's Entrepreneurs Forum in 2000 and is a member of the Clemson University Entrepreneurs’ Roundtable. He served on the Executive Committee of the Greenville Chamber of Commerce, and was a member of South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges’ Commission on Teacher Quality.
In September 2008 Erwin was elected to the national board of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. He also serves on the Boards of the Upstate Alliance and the BI-LO Charity Classic, and served as 2008 upstate campaign co-chair for the United Negro College Fund. He is a graduate of the Diversity Leadership Academy at Furman University.
Food for Thought.
In 2008, Joe Erwin and members of Erwin-Penland’s leadership team created and hosted the first annual Food for Thought conference. This event brought leaders from around the country to Greenville for an experiential “unconventional convention,” showcasing and inspiring creative thinking across business, non-profit, artistic, educational and culinary endeavors.

Solaris (1972 film)

Solaris (, tr. "Solyaris") is a 1972 Russian science fiction art film adaptation of the novel "Solaris" (1961), directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The film is a meditative psychological drama occurring mostly aboard a space station orbiting the fictional planet Solaris. The scientific mission has stalled out because the meager skeleton crew of three scientists have fallen into separate emotional crises. Psychologist Kris Kelvin travels to the Solaris space station to evaluate the situation only to encounter the same mysterious phenomenon as the others.
The original science fiction novel by Polish author Stanisław Lem is about the ultimate inadequacy of communication between humans and other species. Tarkovsky's adaptation is a “drama of grief and partial recovery” concentrated upon the thoughts and the consciences of the cosmonaut scientists studying Solaris' mysterious ocean. With the complex and slow-paced narrative of Solaris, Tarkovsky wanted to bring a new emotional and intellectual depth to the genre, since he viewed western science fiction as shallow. The ideas which Tarkovsky tried to express in this film are further developed in "Stalker" (1979).
The critically successful "Solaris" features Natalya Bondarchuk (Hari), Donatas Banionis (Kris Kelvin), Jüri Järvet (Dr Snaut), Vladislav Dvorzhetsky (Henri Berton), Nikolai Grinko (Kris Kelvin’s Father), Olga Barnet (Kris Kelvin’s Mother), Anatoli Solonitsyn (Dr Sartorius), and Sos Sargsyan (Dr Gibarian); the music is by Johann Sebastian Bach and Eduard Artemyev. At the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, it won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury, the FIPRESCI prize and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. The film is often cited as one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of cinematography.
Plot.
Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) spends his last day on Earth reflecting on his life while walking by a lake near his childhood home where his elderly father still resides. Kelvin is about to embark on an interstellar journey to a space station orbiting the remote oceanic planet Solaris. After decades of study, the scientific mission at the space station has barely progressed. The crew is sending confusing messages. Kelvin is dispatched to evaluate the situation aboard ship and determine whether the venture should continue.
Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky), a former space pilot, visits Kelvin. They watch film footage of Berton's own testimony years before of seeing a four-meter-tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris while searching for two lost scientists. However, the cameras of his craft recorded only clouds and the flat ocean surface; Berton's report was dismissed as hallucinations. After failing to convince Kelvin of the reality of his experience, Berton angrily departs, only to contact Kelvin later on via videophone from his private car. He explains that he met the child of a scientist lost on that mission, and the child was like a much smaller version of the one he had seen on Solaris.
Before departing Earth for Solaris, Kelvin destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire, noting the volume of keepsakes he has accumulated. In Kelvin's last conversation with his father (Nikolai Grinko), they realize that the father will probably not live to see Kelvin return. Although he readily accepted the mission, it is a choice that weighs heavily upon Kelvin's conscience.
Upon his arrival at Solaris Station, a scientific research station hovering above the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, who finds the disarrayed space station dangerously neglected. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan), had killed himself. The two surviving crewmen are uncooperative and evasive. Kelvin soon glimpses other people aboard the station, not supposed to be there. Upon entering the late Gibarian's room, Kelvin finds a rambling cryptic farewell video message from Gibarian addressed to him.
Waking exhausted from a restless sleep, Kelvin finds a woman with him in his quarters despite the barricaded door. To his surprise, it is Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), his late wife who committed suicide some years before. She is unaware of what has happened or how she got there. Terrified by her presence, he lures her into a space capsule and launches the replica of his wife into outer space. In his haste to be rid of her he is scorched by the rocket’s blast. Dr. Snaut tends to his burns and explains that the “visitors” began appearing after the scientists attracted the attention of Solaris, seemingly a sentient entity.
That evening, Hari reappears in his quarters. This time Kelvin calmly accepts her presence and embraces Hari throughout the night. Kelvin later causes her to panic by suddenly leaving the room and shutting the door behind him. She hysterically tears her way through the room's metal door, severely cutting herself. Before he can give first aid, her injuries heal before his eyes. Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) calls for a meeting, and Kelvin introduces Hari as his wife. In their symposium, the scientists begin to understand that Solaris created Hari from Kelvin’s memories of his dead wife. The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of "neutrino systems" but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of an offscreen device known as "the annihilator".
Kelvin shows Hari films of himself and his parents when he was a boy and, later, of his wife. While she is asleep, Snaut proposes beaming Kelvin’s brainwave patterns at Solaris in hopes that it will understand them and stop the disturbing apparitions as communication. However, Sartorius suggests a radical attack of heavy radiation bombardment. In time, Hari becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin’s presence. She learns from Sartorius that the original Hari had committed suicide ten years earlier, and Kelvin is forced to tell her the entire story. Sartorius, Snaut, Kelvin and Hari gather together for a birthday party which turns into a philosophical argument during which Sartorius tells Hari that she is not human, but a mere copy. Distressed, Hari kills herself again by drinking liquid oxygen, only to painfully, spasmodically resurrect a few minutes later. On the surface of Solaris, the ocean is moving even faster.
Kelvin goes to sleep only to wake up agitated and running a fever and gives a monologue to Snaut on the subject of suffering and universal love, then falls asleep again. He dreams of his mother as a young woman, caring for him and expressing her worry concerning Kelvin's emotional state. When he awakens, Hari is gone, and Snaut reads him the farewell note she left behind. The note indicates that Hari petitioned the two scientists to destroy her. Snaut tells Kelvin that since they broadcast Kelvin’s brainwaves at Solaris, the visitors stopped appearing and islands began forming on the planet's surface. Kelvin debates whether or not to return to Earth or to descend to Solaris in hopes of reconnecting with everything he has loved and lost.
Again at the shore of the frozen lake, Kelvin finds himself at his father's house. His dog runs to him, and he happily walks towards it. He realizes something is peculiar, though, when he sees that his father seems oblivious to the fact that it's raining inside the house. Father and son embrace on the front step of the lakeside house which the camera zooms out to reveal is located on an island in the middle of an ocean on the planet Solaris.
Production.
Writing.
In 1968, the director Andrei Tarkovsky had two motives for cinematically adapting the Polish science fiction novel "Solaris" (1961), Stanisław Lem: firstly, he admired Lem's work. Secondly, he needed work and money, because his previous film, "Andrei Rublev" (1966) had gone unreleased, and his screenplay, "A White, White Day," had been rejected (even though in 1975 it would be realised as "The Mirror"). A film of a novel by Stanisław Lem, a popular and critically respected writer in the USSR, was a logical commercial and artistic choice. Tarkovsky and Lem collaborated and remained in communication about the cinematic adaptation of the novel "Solaris". With Fridrikh Gorenshtein, Tarkovsky co-wrote the first screenplay in the Summer of 1969; two thirds of it occurred on Earth. The Mosfilm committee disliked it and Lem got furious over this unacceptably drastic alteration of his novel. The final screenplay yielded the shooting script which has less action on Earth, and Kelvin’s marriage to his second wife, Maria, was deleted from the story.
In the literary "Solaris", Stanisław Lem describes science’s inadequacy in allowing humans to communicate with an alien life form, because certain forms, at least, of sentient extra-terrestrial life may operate well outside of human experience and understanding. In the cinematic "Solaris", Tarkovsky concentrates upon Kelvin's feelings for his wife, Hari, and the impact of outer space exploration upon the human condition. Dr. Gibarian’s monologue the novel’s sixth chapter is the highlight of the final library scene, wherein Snaut says, “We don’t need other worlds. We need mirrors”. Unlike the novel, which begins with psychologist Kris Kelvin's spaceflight, and occurs entirely on Solaris, the film shows Kelvin’s visit to his parents' house in the country before leaving Earth for Solaris. The contrast establishes the worlds in which he lives — a vibrantly living Earth versus an austere, closed-in space station orbiting the planet Solaris — demonstrating and questioning space exploration’s impact upon the human psyche.
The set design of "Solaris" features paintings by the Old Masters. The interior of the space station is decorated with full reproductions of the 1565 painting cycle of "The Months" ("The Hunters in the Snow", "The Gloomy Day", "The Hay Harvest", "The Harvesters", and "The Return of the Herd"), by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, and details of "Landscape with the Fall of Icarus" and "The Hunters in the Snow" (1565). The scene of Kelvin kneeling before his father and the father embracing him alludes to "The Return of the Prodigal Son" (1669), by Rembrandt. The references and allusions are Tarkovsky’s efforts to give the young art of cinema a historic perspective of centuries, to evoke the viewer’s feeling that cinema is a mature art.
The cast.
Initially, Tarkovsky wanted his ex-wife, Irma Raush, as “Hari”. After meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970, however, he decided that she was a better actress for the role. Wishing to work with Tarkovsky, Andersson accepted her salary in rubles. Nevertheless, Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as “Hari”. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she, ironically, who had introduced the novel, "Solaris" to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970 but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko who cast her in "You and I". Half-a-year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Natalya Bondarchuk as “Hari” after all.
Tarkovsky cast Lithuanian actor Donatas Banionis as “Kris Kelvin”, the Estonian actor Jüri Järvet as “Dr. Snaut”, the Russian actor Anatoly Solonitsyn as “Dr. Sartorius”, the Ukrainian actor Nikolai Grinko as “Kelvin’s Father”, and Olga Barnet as “Kelvin’s Mother”. Earlier, the director had worked with Solonitsyn, who had played "Andrei Rublev" (1966), and with Nikolai Grinko, who appeared in "Andrei Rublev" and "Ivan's Childhood" (1962). Tarkovsky thought Solonitsyn and Grinko would need extra directorial assistance. After filming was almost completed, Tarkovsky rated actors and performances thus: Bondarchuk, Järvet, Solonitsyn, Banionis, Dvorzhetsky, and Grinko; yet wrote in his diary that “Natalya B. has outshone everybody”.
Filming.
In the summer of 1970, the USSR State Committee for Cinematography (Goskino SSSR) authorized the production of "Solaris", with a length of , equivalent to a two-hour-twenty-minute running time. The exteriors were photographed at Zvenigorod, near Moscow; the interiors were photographed at the Mosfilm studios. The scenes of space pilot Berton driving through a city were photographed in Japan, in September and October 1971, at Akasaka and Iikura in Tokyo. The original plan was to film futuristic structures at the World Expo '70 but the trip was delayed. The shooting began in March 1971 with cinematographer Vadim Yusov who also photographed Tarkovky’s previous films. They quarreled so much on this film that they ended up never working together again. The first version of "Solaris" was completed in December 1971.
The Earth, the sensual source of life, and the sterile space station orbiting the planet Solaris, are contrasted with lively images of underwater plants, fire, snow, rain and other natural phenomena. A similar contrast appears at story’s end on Solaris with Kelvin’s "Winter" visit to his father’s house, featuring a frozen pond surrounded by bare trees. The dead scenery of this island on Solaris contrasts with the earlier, Summer pond scenes of long-bladed green grasses or ferns gently floating in the water current underneath blooming trees. The Solaris ocean was created with acetone, aluminium powder, and dyes. Mikhail Romadin designed the space station as lived-in, beat-up and decrepit rather than shiny, neat and futuristic. The designer and director consulted with scientist and aerospace engineer Lupichev, who lent them a 1960s-era mainframe computer for set decoration. For some of the sequences, Romadin designed a mirror room which enabled the cameraman, Yusov, to hide within a mirrored sphere so as to be invisible in the finished film. Akira Kurosawa, who was visiting the Mosfilm studios just then, expressed admiration for the space station design.
In January 1972 the State Committee for Cinematography requested editorial changes before releasing "Solaris". These included a more realistic film with a clearer image of the future and deletion of allusions to God and Christianity. Tarkovsky successfully resisted such major changes, and after a few minor edits "Solaris" was approved for release in March 1972.
Music.
The soundtrack of "Solaris" features the chorale prelude for organ, "Ich ruf’ zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ" (BWV 639), by Johann Sebastian Bach, and an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. The prelude is the central musical theme of "Solaris". Tarkovsky initially wanted the film to be devoid of music and asked composer Artemyev to orchestrate ambient sounds as a musical score. The latter proposed subtly introducing orchestral music. In counterpoint to classical music as Earth's theme is fluid electronic music as the theme for the planet "Solaris". The character of Hari has her own subtheme, a cantus firmus based upon J. S. Bach’s music featuring Artemyev’s composition atop it; it is heard at Hari’s death and at story’s end.
Reception and legacy.
"Solaris" premiered at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. In the USSR, the film premiered in the "Mir" film theater in Moscow on 5 February 1973. Tarkovsky did not consider the "Mir" cinema the best projection venue. Despite the film's narrow release in only five film theaters in the USSR, the film nevertheless sold 10.5 million tickets. Unlike the vast majority of commercial and ideological films in the 1970s, "Solaris" was screened in the USSR in limited runs for 15 years without any breaks, giving it cult status. In the Eastern Bloc and in the West, "Solaris" premiered later. In the United States, a version of "Solaris" that was truncated by 30 minutes premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on 6 October 1976.
Although Stanisław Lem worked with Tarkovsky and Friedrich Gorenstein in developing the screenplay, Lem maintained that he "never really liked Tarkovsky’s version” of his novel. Tarkovsky wanted a film story based on the novel but artistically independent of its origin. However, Lem opposed any divergence of the screenplay from the novel. Tarkovsky claimed that Lem did not fully appreciate cinema and that he expected the film to merely illustrate the novel without creating an original cinematic piece. Tarkovsky’s film is about the inner lives of its scientists as human beings. Lem’s novel is about the conflicts of man’s condition in nature and the nature of man in the universe. For Tarkovsky, Lem's exposition of that existential conflict was the starting point for describing the inner lives of the characters.
In the autobiographical documentary "Voyage in Time" (1983), Tarkovsky says he viewed "Solaris" as an artistic failure because his film did not transcend genre as he believed his film "Stalker" (1979) did due to the required technological dialogue and special effects. M. Galina in the 1997 article "Identifying Fears" called this film "one of the biggest events in the Soviet science fiction cinema" and one of the few works that does not seem anachronistic nowadays.
A list of "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" compiled by "Empire" magazine in 2010 ranked Tarkovsky's "Solaris" at #68. In 2002, Steven Soderbergh wrote and directed an American adaptation of "Solaris", which starred George Clooney.
Salman Rushdie calls "Solaris" "a sci-fi masterpiece", and has urged that "This exploration of the unreliability of reality and the power of the human unconscious, this great examination of the limits of rationalism and the perverse power of even the most ill-fated love, needs to be seen as widely as possible before it's transformed by Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron into what they ludicrously threaten will be "2001" meets "Last Tango in Paris".' What, sex in space with floating butter? Tarkovsky must be turning over in his grave." Alex Deeley called the film "so organic and complex that it defies categorisation." 
Nimród Antal cites Solaris as one of the influences on the making of his first movie, "Kontroll". "Kontroll" has many similarities with Solaris, such as the ambiguity of reality and the hallucinatory look.
Film critic Roger Ebert compared the 2011 film "Another Earth" with "Solaris "by noting that "Another Earth" "is as thought-provoking, in a less profound way, than Tarkovsky's "Solaris", another film about a sort of parallel Earth."
Home media.
On 24 May 2011, The Criterion Collection released "Solaris" on Blu-ray Disc. The most noticeable difference from the previous 2002 Criterion DVD release was that the blue and white tinted monochrome scenes from the film were restored.

Promotion to the Bayernliga

The "Fußball-Bayernliga", the fifth tier of the German football league system and highest football league in the state of Bavaria, has had four teams annually promoted to the league, the champions of the three "Landesligas", and a fourth club, determined by an annual promotion round. It involved the runners-up from the three "Landesligas" and the team in the "Oberliga" placed right above the relegation ranks.
The Bavarian football federation decided on drastic changes to the league system from 2012 onwards. With the introduction of the Regionalliga Bayern from 2012–13, it placed two Bayernligas, north and south, below the new league as the new fifth tier of the German league system. Below those, five Landesligas instead of the existing three were set, which would be geographically divided to limit travel and increase the number of local derbies.
History and modus.
In 1963, alongside the establishment of the "Fußball-Bundesliga", a single-division, highest league for the state of Bavaria, the "Amateurliga Bayern" was established, too. Below this league, three regional "Landesligas" were formed to replace the previously existing "2nd Amateurligas":
From the 1963-64 season onwards, the champions of each of these three leagues were directly promoted to the "Amateurliga Bayern", or, as it is commonly called, the "Bayernliga". In turn, the bottom three teams in the "Bayernliga" were relegated to the "Landesliga", according to their region of origin.
In 1978, the "Amateurliga Bayern" was renamed "Amateur Oberliga Bayern".
In 1981, this modus changed as the Bavarian football association wanted each runners-up team in the Bavarian leagues to have a chance for promotion, too. Nowadays, the statutes of the BFV actually specify that every runners-up in Bavaria has the right to take part in promotion round, providing the league it can earn promotion to is part of the Bavarian football league system.
A system was established whereby the three "Landesliga" runners-up and the "Bayernliga" team placed right above the relegation ranks determined one more team to enter the league for the next season. A draw would establish which two teams met each other in the first round in an on-off game, with all games to be played on neutral grounds, preferably at a location half-way between the two clubs. The winners of those two games would then advance to a final to determined the team that would play in the "Bayernliga" next season.
Exceptions existed in regards to the number of teams promoted. If the "Bayernliga" champion managed to win promotion to the "2nd Bundesliga" and no team from that league was relegated to the "Bayernliga", an extra team was promoted from the "Landesliga". Also, in 1994, due to the formation of the "Regionalligas", eight teams from the "Landesligas" earned promotion to the "Bayernliga" with the promotion round being played between the third placed teams. A similar situation existed in 2008, when the "3rd Liga" was established. Generally, after 1994 in a most seasons more than one club was promoted.
In 1994, the "Amateur Oberliga Bayern" was renamed "Oberliga Bayern".
Because of the establishment of the Regionalliga Bayern in 2012 and the expansion of the Bayernliga from one to two regional divisions a large number of clubs earned promotion to the league in 2012. Additionally, the number of Landesligas was expanded from three to five.

2006.
The 2006 round saw two newcomers to the competition, Regensburg and Thannhausen, while Kempten attempted and failed to defend their "Bayernlig" spot. With the 1. FC Bamberg, five time "Bayernliga" champions, a team returned to the league who hadn't played at this level since 1986.
2007.
In 2007, TSG Thannhausen archived promotion through the promotion round in their second attempt to do so. For Haibach it was their third time to take part in the competition. In the other match-up, Grossbardorf played for a "Bayernliga" spot for a second time while SV Schalding-Heining was a newcomer. A final was not necessary as two promotion spots were available.
2008.
Due to the establishment of the "3rd Liga" and an additional "Regionalliga", the "Regionalliga West", five teams from the "Bayernliga" were promoted to the "Regionalliga Süd" this season. For the "Landesliga" clubs, this meant, seven promotion spots were available to the "Bayernliga". All first and second placed teams received direct promotion, while the three third placed clubs had to play the 16th placed "Bayernliga" team for one more spot. As it tuned out, due to the Sportfreunde Siegen not receiving a licence for the "Regionalliga", another spot for Bavaria became available and FC Schweinfurt 05, loser of the final, did not lose its "Bayernliga" spot after all.
2009.
In the 2009 edition, a number of deciders had to be played to determine the clubs taking part in the promotion round. Three clubs in the "Oberliga" had finished on equal points on the 14th, 15th and 16th rank. Of these, one would remain in the "Oberliga", one would have to enter the promotion/relegation round and one would be directly relegated. TSV Rain am Lech earned another "Bayernliga" season by defeating Würzburger FV 2-0 and SV Seligenporten 5-1. The later two then had to play one more game to determine who would enter the relegation round. In the "Landesliga Mitte", a decider between SpVgg Landshut and ASV Neumarkt was necessary as they had both finished on equal points, which Landshut won. From the other two leagues, FC Affing had never played in the "Bayernliga" before while the 1. FC Sand had spent two seasons in the league from 2000 to 2002.

Wenzhou Medical College

Wenzhou Medical University (WMU; ), designated as a key university in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, is an institution of higher learning under the leadership of Zhejiang Provincial Government.
History.
Its history can be traced back to Zhejiang Specialized Medical School established in Hangzhou in 1912, named Zhejiang Second Medical College at that time. In August 1958, part of Zhejiang Medical College was moved from Hangzhou to Wenzhou and began recruiting 5-year fulltime program students, hence the name "Wenzhou Medical College" (WMC).
In 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Higher Education china upgraded WMC's status to that of a medical university; it has thus been renamed the Wenzhou Medical University.

Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program

Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program is a $25 billion direct loan program funded by Congress in fall 2008 to provide debt capital to the U.S. automotive industry for the purpose of funding projects that help vehicles manufactured in the U.S. meet higher mileage requirements and lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil. This program is unrelated to the United States Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) which has been providing bailout funding to two of the big three U.S. automakers.
Given 60 days by congressional statute to issue an interim final rule, the Department of Energy (DOE), responsible for overseeing the program, finalized the rule 36 days later on November 5, 2008 (compared to 18 months usually needed for such rule making). The loan program was authorized under section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which provided the program with $25 billion in loan authority, supported by a $7.5 billion appropriation to fund the credit subsidy, or the 30% risk profile expected for projects of this type. To qualify, automakers and eligible component manufacturers must promise to increase the fuel economy of their products by 25% over the average fuel economy of similar 2005 models, and apply the loans to future investments "reasonably related to the reequipping, expanding, or establishing a manufacturing facility in the U.S." In distributing the loans the DOE may decide which technologies it believes are most promising and deserving of assistance. Loan recipients must also be "financially viable" for the length of the loan.
It has been speculated that at least two of the Big Three U.S. automobile manufacturers may not be able to qualify for this program because of its fuel economy and financial solvency requirements.
In November 2008, the auto industry began lobbying for the $25 billion to be loaned immediately, as well as another $25 billion to be loaned later to cover retirees health care costs.
As originally worded, the program was applicable only to four-wheeled passenger vehicles. In October 2009, a bill sponsored by California Representatives Brian Bilbray and Adam Schiff was passed extending the program's coverage to include high mileage (75 mpg equivalent) two- and three-wheeled vehicles.
DOE's Alternative Vehicle Technologies Awards.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced in December 2008 the selection of six cost-shared research projects for the development and demonstration of alternative vehicle technology projects totaling a DOE investment of up to $14.55 million over three years, subject to annual appropriations. Private sector contributions will further increase the financial investment for a total of up to $29.3 million. The selections announced are part of DOE’s continuing work to develop high efficiency vehicle technologies and are not part of the recently announced $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. These projects were selected under three diverse topic areas: lithium-ion battery materials and manufacturing (3M Company for developing advanced anode; BASF Catalyst for domestic production of low cost cathode materials and FMC Corporation for scaling up production of stabilized lithium metal powder for high energy cathodes); thermoelectric heating, ventilation and air conditioning (TE HVAC system); and aerodynamic heavy-duty truck trailers (Navistar International Corporation).
Conditional loans.
USDOE announced in 2009 $8 billion in conditional loan agreements for Ford Motor Company; Nissan North America, Inc.; and Tesla Motors, Inc. to fund the development of advanced vehicle technologies. The loan commitments include a $5.9 billion loan to Ford for upgrading factories in five states to produce 13 more fuel-efficient models, a $1.6 billion loan to Nissan to build advanced electric vehicles and advanced batteries, and a $465 million loan to Tesla Motors to manufacture its new electric sedan. These are the first conditional loans released under DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program, which is using an open, competitive process to provide about $25 billion in loans to companies that produce cars or vehicle components in the United States. To qualify, companies must propose projects that increase fuel economy to at least 25% above 2005 fuel economy levels.
Ford Motor Company will receive its loans through 2011, using the funds to upgrade its engine plants in Dearborn, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; and Lima, Ohio, and to upgrade its transmission plants in Livonia, Michigan; Sterling Heights, Michigan; and Sharonville, Ohio. Ford will also upgrade its assembly plants in Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; Dearborn, Michigan; Wayne, Michigan; and Kansas City, Missouri, converting two of the truck factories into assembly plants for cars. In addition, the Ford loans will finance advances in traditional combustion engines and electrified vehicles and help raise the fuel efficiency of more than two dozen popular models.
Nissan aims to manufacture a cost-competitive electric vehicle with a lithium-ion battery pack in Smyrna, Tennessee, and plans to eventually reach a production capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year.
Tesla Motors will use its funding to finance a California-based manufacturing facility for the Tesla Model S sedan, an all-electric sedan that can be recharged at a conventional 120-volt or 220-volt outlet. Production will begin in 2011 and ramp up to 20,000 vehicles per year by the end of 2013.
The fourth conditional commitment the Department of Energy has entered into under the ATVM Loan program is a $528.7 million loan for Fisker Automotive for the development of two lines of plug-in hybrids by 2016.

Canada Camp

Following Israel’s occupation of the Sinai in 1967, some 5,000 Palestinian refugees in Rafah were forced to relocate when their shelters were destroyed by the Israeli authorities during road widening and "security measures" of the early 1970s. These refugees were relocated to an extension of the Rafah refugee camp that was constructed on formerly Egyptian soil This camp became known as Canada Camp after the Canadian Contingent to UNEF(the first United nations Emergency Force, November 1956 – June 1967) that had been present in the area.
Following the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979, which resulted from the 1978 Camp David Accords, Israel withdrew from the Sinai, and the boundary between Egypt and Israel was redrawn in 1982. These some 5,000 UNRWA registered refugees found themselves stranded on the Egyptian side of the line. Under the Camp David Accords, Israel and Egypt had agreed on the repatriation of these refugees to the Gaza Strip, and all the Canada camp residents believed, as they had been told, that within 6 months they would be back in the Gaza Strip. However, funding problems, bureaucratic delays, lack of political will and difficult security conditions prolonged the process. 
Life for refugees in Canada Camp was particularly hard, as they were cut off from work in both Gaza and Israel, and unable to work in Egypt, in fact, they had to pay every six months to have their Egyptian visas renewed. Family and friends, unable to see each other due to the practical impossibility of gaining the necessary permits, could only communicate at the “shouting fence” across the border strip. higher education and proper health care were only available by paying fees much higher than most people could afford. For treatment of serious medical problems, Canada Camp residents would have to pay locally or travel to the Palestine Red Crescent Hospital in Cairo. 
It was not until 1989 that a mechanism for the return of these refugees to the Gaza Strip was established, and, with pressure and financial support from the government of Canada and the Kuwaiti fund for Arab Economic Development, together with effort from the other players (namely UNRWA, Israel and the Palestinian Authority) refugees started moving across the border, mainly to the Tall as-Sultan district of Rafah. It was not until December 27, 2000 that the last families were able to return (Wilkinson, 2001). Canada also provided funds for the construction of a community centre in Tall as-Sultan for the benefit of the returning families (Wilkinson, 2001).

Greater Jerusalem is a term used generally to describe the area encompassing the approximately one hundred square miles surrounding the Old City of Jerusalem. The expansion of Jerusalem under Israeli law followed its de facto annexation of the city in the aftermath of the 1967 Six-Day War, however such expansion has remained unrecognised by the International community which considers all Israeli migration and housing establishments in the area a violation of international law, labelling such housing projects Israeli settlements.

Ryszard Wasko

Ryszard Wasko (Waśko) (born February 21, 1947 in Nysa) is a Polish artist, who has worked in multimedia, including photography, film, video, installation, painting, and drawing. He is also known as a curator and organizer of art events. 
He lives and works in Berlin.
Early life.
Workshop of the Film Form (1970-1977).
He was born in Nysa. As a child he took painting-classes planning to become a painter and wanting to study at the Art Academy in Cracow. But instead of making his childhood dream come true, he made up his mind and went to Lodz, where he studied cinematography at the Film School between 1970 and 1975. During that time he became a member of "Workshop of the Film Form", one of the most important artistic groups in Poland in the 70s. "Workshop" was an avant-garde collective of painters, filmmakers, critics, poets, philosophers and scientists, working with experimental film and multimedia. Later on Ryszard Wasko became a lecturer in the departments of experimental media and photography at the Film School in Lodz.
First accomplishments.
In the 70s he took part in the XII São Paulo Art Biennial, documenta 6, the Third International Festival of Indepdendent Avant-garde Film in London, the Sydney Biennale, the XI Biennale de Paris, the V Biennale of Spatial Forms among others. He also created the "Archives of Contemporary Thought" (1979), a forum for symposia and art events.
Early works.
After dealing with experimental film and photography, Wasko started to develop his painting skills again. ""Wasko discovered himself as an artist and learned how to cope with everyday life with a greater vision of the world than simply the provincial circumstances of life. "" He left the "Workshop of the Film Form" and came to prominence as a conceptual artist. ""After studying film-making at the Academy in Lodz in the late sixties, Wasko went on to become one of Poland's leading conceptualists, working as a pioneer in the media of video and photography. Much of this work focused on dense mathematical structures involving sequences of time and reality."" His artistic output should be actually seen as a connection of two main fields: photography&film and painting. ""(...) the character of Ryszard Wasko's work in general, as well as the character of his individual works, is often defined by inter-generic, inter-media relations. Those works set in motion a whole net of intertextual relations on the level of general structural and ontological determinants, and on the level of different types of perception and rules of interpretation. In other words, in order to grasp a work which belongs to a certain artistic genre in its specificity, one should refer to its non-specific features which are characteristic for another kind of art.""
Construction in Process (1981).
""It is impossible (...) to separate his activities as an artist (as a maker of installations, as a creator of paintings and works on paper) from his other endeavors as a curator, organizer, teacher, writer, agitator (...)."" Artists who were invited to participate in "Construction in Process" invite in turn, another group of participants, giving the project a dynamic, open character. "" The event became a symbolic alternative to larger institutional art events, including high-powered state and corporate-sponsored biennials and market-driven art fairs."" The participating artists were Richard Serra, Sol LeWitt, Brian O'Doherty, Dennis Oppenheim, Lawrence Weiner, Richard Nonas and others. After the first event in 1981 "The Solidarity Collection" (which includes works by the artists created for that event) came into existence. ""Wasko continued to produce international events into the nineties, including two additional projects in Lodz (1990 and 1993), one in Israel (1995), one in Australia (1997), and another,(...) in the small town of Bydgogosz in north central Poland (2000)."" 2006, 25 years after the opening of the first exhibition, Wasko established the "Construction in Process-Museum" (also in Lodz). Unfortunately, a waterdamage forced him to close it down (2008) and to devolve the collection to the Muzeum Sztuki in Lodz.
Exile (1983-1993).
Artistic career abroad.
After Martial Law was brought on in Poland, Wasko decided to leave for Germany(1983). He received there a DAAD scholarship in Berlin among other residencies. In the 80s he improved as a painter. Besides numerous one-man-shows Wasko took part in several international exhitbitions e.g. at Centre Georges Pompidou, Kunsthalle Hamburg and the Venice Biennale (1991, 1999, 2001, 2007). At the same time he lectured extensively in Europe, including at Saint Martin's School of Art, Hochschule der Künste in Berlin and Freie Kunstakademie in Essen.
The Pollock-Krasner Foundation has awarded Ryszard Wasko three times (1988,1993,1998).
The International Artists' Museum.
Wasko went to Poland in 1989 and founded The International Artists' Museum in Lodz. It had developed into a worldwide network of locally run art centers, linking artists and intellectuals from diverse backgrounds, locations, and disciplines. It was "" (...) an on-going alternative space that shows the work of international artists."" The Museum has organized and sponsored over 60 major international events, exhibitions, meetings, panels, concerts, readings, and projects focusing on art, culture, borders, community, and identity. Due to political changes in the city government the building of the International Artist's Museum at Tylna Street 14 has been sold to a private Bank (1998). The artistic community was not able to gather the vast sum of money the city of Lodz wanted for the property. The beautiful sculpture garden has been destroyed by the new owners. Only the work of Sol LeWitt is still standing at its original place.""His paradoxical brand of conceptual humanism has always been toward developing a better world and more spiritually-oriented environment for artists in which they can produce work outside of marketing restrictions, and thus communicate ideas that will benefit common people."" Unfortunately, his ideas were never understood by the authorities.
Growing up and experimentalizing.
""For many years, austere, yet gorgeous, works on paper have been a big part of Wasko's oeuvre."" The drawings brought him to artpieces on canvas. In that time Wasko acted mainly as a painter. He started working with different materials lik soot, was, fat, zinc, fire, and others. ""(...) the most important modification was the use of different materials than before. (...) Wasko turned to the simplest, 'poor' means of natural origin.""
Łódź (1993-2008).
Curator, director, teacher.
Between 1990 and 1992 Wasko became Program Director at the P.S.1 Museum and Institute of Contemporary Art (today called P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center) in New York and in 1997 he was chosen President of the International Artists Forum (IKG). At the same time he still handled the "International Artist's Museum" in Lodz. That town became Wasko's new home for over 15 years. The Valand School of Fine Arts in Göteborg invited him to give lectures as a Professor for two semesters (2004–2005). 
Back in Berlin (2008).
In 2007, together with his wife Maria Wasko, he decided to move back to Berlin. They live there since 2008. 
Recent solo exhibitions include a retrospection at the Museum of History of the City of Lodz (Ryszard Wasko, Lodz – Berlin, works 1971-1996) in 2008 and at the Haus am Lützowplatz in Berlin (Contemporary Portrait, Checkpoint Charlie Hypothetical) in 2009: ""Ryszard Wasko zeigt in seiner gleichnamigen Malereiausstellung Bilder von Personen, die ihre Identität verbergen. Farbenfroh in Warhol'scher Plakativität verschwinden hier auch die letzten Details. Doch sind es Armeen oder vervielfältigte Individuen? Die Persönlichkeit wie das Anliegen bleiben bei Wasko auf der Strecke und der Hintergrund verschwimmt zu einem psychedelischen Farbenmeer.""

Alessandro Piperno

Alessandro Piperno (born Rome, March 25, 1972) is an Italian writer and literary critic of Jewish descent, having a Jewish father and a Catholic mother.
He graduated in French Literature at the University of Rome, where he currently teaches and researches. In 2000, he published the controversial critical essay on Marcel Proust, inflammatorily entitled "Proust antiebreo (Proust, Anti-Jew)".
In 2005, he achieved notoriety with his first novel "Con le peggiori intenzioni" (translated as "The Worst Intentions"). Following general critical acclaim, and positive reviews on the Corriere della Sera (defining him the "new Proust"), his book became a bestseller in Italy (with 200,000 copies sold in a few months). For this book he won the Premio Campiello for best first novel. The book narrates the story of the Sonnino family spanning half a century, and especially the life of its youngest member, Daniel. Piperno's book attracted noticeable interest with the media, involving Piperno in a number of TV interviews and literary debates. His writing is described both as ironic and ironically self-referential, with a disenchanted view of society and life in general. His critics have emphasised Piperno's difficult storyline and its allegedly confused narration. He states his inspiration as coming from the great literature of the 19th century, as well as that of contemporary America. Besides Proust (naturally), he’s been associated to Philip Roth.
In 2012, Piperno won the Premio Strega, Italy's leading literary award, for his novel "Inseparabili" (2012). It traces the lives of two brothers, Philip and Samuel Pontecorvo, after the painful death of their father Leo Pontecorvo. It is a sequel of "Persecuzione" published in 2010.
Piperno studied guitar and has a strong interest in music. Until 2005, when he reached success as a writer, he was part of the Roman rock-blues Random as the solo guitarist and singer. He’s also a fan of soccer team Lazio.

Planet of the Apes (2001 film)

Planet of the Apes is a 2001 American science fiction film, based on Pierre Boulle's novel and a loose remake of the 1968 film of the same name. Tim Burton directed the film, which stars Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella Warren. It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but with the help of an ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion.
Development for a "Planet of the Apes" remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the pre-production stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled "Return of the Apes", would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.
With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Tim Burton was hired as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. "Planet of the Apes" was released to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised. Despite the film's financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and instead rebooted the "Planet of the Apes" franchise altogether in 2011 with "Rise of the Planet of the Apes".
Plot.
In 2029, aboard the United States Air Force space station "Oberon", Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) works closely with primates who are trained for space missions. His favorite simian co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station, a small space pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Against his commanding officer's orders, Leo takes a second pod and goes in pursuit of Pericles. Entering the storm, Leo loses contact with the "Oberon" and crashes on a planet called Ashlar in the year 5021. He discovers that the world is ruled by humanoid apes who can speak human language and treat human beings as slaves. 
Leo comes across a female chimpanzee named Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), who protests the awful treatment humans receive. Ari decides to buy Leo and a female slave named Daena (Estella Warren) to have them work as servants in the house of her father, Senator Sandar (David Warner). Leo escapes his cage and frees other humans. Ari sees them, but Leo manages to convince Ari to join a human rebellion against the apes. General Thade (Tim Roth) and Colonel Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) march ape warriors in pursuit of the humans. Leo discovers Calima (the temple of "Semos"), a forbidden, but holy, site for the apes.
Calima turns out to be the remains of the "Oberon", Leo's space station, which has crashed on the planet's surface and looks ancient (the name Calima coming from the sign "CAution LIve aniMAls", the relevant letters being the only ones not covered in dust). According to the computer logs, the station has been there for thousands of years. Leo deduces that when he entered the vortex he was pushed forward in time, while the "Oberon", searching after him, was not, crashing on the planet long before he did.
The "Oberon"s log reveals that the apes on board, led by Semos, organized a mutiny and took control of the vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. In the present, a battle ensues between the humans and the apes. A familiar vehicle descends from the sky and is identified immediately by Leo as the pod piloted by Pericles, the chimp astronaut. Pericles was pushed forward in time as Leo was, and had just now found his way to the planet. When Pericles lands, the apes interpret his landing as the return arrival of Semos, the first ape, who is their god. They bow, and hostilities between humans and apes disappear.
Pericles then runs into the "Oberon" and Leo runs after him, followed by General Thade. Inside, Thade and Leo wrestle, with Pericles trying to help Leo, only to be thrown hard against a wall. Thade gets hold of Leo's gun, trying to figure out how to discharge the gun and appears to want to shoot Leo. Seeing that Thade is in the pilot's deck, Leo closes the automatic door of the entrance, trapping Thade as he shoots the gun, the bullets ricocheting off the door harmlessly. Thade thrashes around to escape, but after all attempts to do so fail, he finally gives up. Leo then decides that it is time for him to leave the Planet of the Apes, so he gives Pericles to Ari, with her promising to look after him, also saying farewell to Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and uses it to travel back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo ends up crashing in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at the Memorial, and sees it is now a monument in honor of General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, but on closer inspection, they are all apes.
Cast.
Small roles include David Warner (Senator Sandar), Lisa Marie (Nova), Erick Avari (Tival), Luke Eberl (Birn), Evan Parke (Gunnar), Glenn Shadix (Senator Nado), Freda Foh Shen (Bon), and Chris Ellis (Lt. Gen. Karl Vasich). 
Titled "Return to the Planet of the Apes", the project was put on fast track and almost entered pre-production. Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic makeup with Danny Elfman composing the film score. Tom Cruise and Charlie Sheen were in contention for the lead role. "I can't accurately describe in words the utter euphoria I felt knowing that I, Adam Rifkin, was going to be resurrecting the "Planet of the Apes". It all seemed too good to be true. I soon found out it was." Days before the film was to commence pre-production, new studio executives arrived at Fox, which caused creative differences between Rifkin and the studio. Rifkin was commissioned to rewrite the script through various drafts. The project was abandoned until Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh pitched their own idea, with the apes going through a Renaissance. In the story, the ape government becomes concerned over the new art works, the humans are revolting and the liberal apes shelter a half-human, half-ape from the gorillas. Roddy McDowall was enthusiastic about their proposal and agreed to play the Leonardo da Vinci-type character they had written for him. However, the executive Jackson spoke to was not a fan of the series and seemingly unaware of McDowall's involvement in the series, and Jackson turned his attention back to "Heavenly Creatures".
Oliver Stone.
By 1993, Fox hired Don Murphy and Jane Hamsher as producers. Sam Raimi and Oliver Stone were being considered as possible directors, though Stone signed on as executive producer/co-writer with a $1 million salary. On the storyline, Stone explained in December 1993, "It has the discovery of cryogenically frozen Vedic Apes who hold the secret numeric codes to the Bible that foretold the end of civilizations. It deals with past versus the future. My concept is that there's a code inscribed in the Bible that predicts all historical events. The apes were there at the beginning and figured it all out."
Stone brought Terry Hayes to write the screenplay entitled "Return of the Apes". Set in the near future, a plague is making humans extinct. Geneticist Will Robinson discovers the plague is a genetic time bomb embedded in the Stone Age. He time travels with a pregnant colleague named Billie Rae Diamond to a time when Palaeolithic humans were at war for the future of the planet with highly-evolved apes. The apes' supreme commander is a gorilla named Drak. Robinson and Billie Rae discover a young human girl named Aiv (pronounced Eve) to be the next step in evolution. It is revealed that it was the apes that created the virus to destroy the human race. They protect her from the virus, thus ensuring the survival of the human race 102,000 years later. Billie Rae gives birth to a baby boy named Adam.
Fox president Peter Chernin called "Return of the Apes" "one of the best scripts I ever read". Chernin was hoping Hayes' script would create a franchise that included sequels, spin-off television shows and merchandise. In March 1994, Arnold Schwarzenegger signed on as Will Robinson with the condition he had approval of director. Chuck Russell was considered as a possible director before Phillip Noyce was hired in January 1995, while pre-production was nearing commencement with a $100 million budget. Stone first approached Rick Baker, who worked on Adam Rifkin's failed remake, to design the prosthetic makeup, but eventually hired Stan Winston.
Fox became frustrated by the distance between their approach and Hayes' interpretation of Stone's ideas, as producer Don Murphy put it, "Terry wrote a "Terminator" and Fox wanted "The Flintstones"". Fox studio executive Dylan Sellers felt the script could be improved by comedy. "What if Robinson finds himself in Ape land and the Apes are trying to play baseball? But they're missing one element, like the pitcher or something." Sellers continued. "Robinson knows what they're missing and he shows them, and they all start playing." Sellers refused to give up his baseball scene, and when Hayes turned in the next script, sans baseball, Sellers fired him. Dissatisfied with Sellers' decision to fire Hayes, Noyce left "Return of the Apes" in February 1995 to work on "The Saint".
Columbus and Cameron.
Oliver Stone pursued other films of his own, Peter Chernin was replaced by Thomas Rothman, and a drunken Dylan Sellers crashed his car, killing a much-loved colleague and earning jail time, while producers Don Murphy and Jane Hamsher were paid off. "After they got rid of us, they brought on Chris Columbus," Murphy stated. "Then I heard they did tests of apes skiing, which didn't make much sense." Stan Winston was still working on the makeup designs. Columbus brought Sam Hamm, his co-writer on an unproduced "Fantastic Four" script, to write the screenplay. "We tried to do a story that was simultaneously a homage to the elements we liked from the five films, and would also incorporate a lot of material Pierre Boulle's novel that had been jettisoned from the earlier production," Hamm continued. "The first half of the script bore little resemblance to the book, but a lot of the stuff in the second half comes directly from it, or directly inspired by it."
Hamm's script had an ape astronaut from another planet crash-landing in New York Harbor, launching a virus that will make human beings extinct. Dr. Susan Landis, who works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Alexander Troy, an Area 51 scientist, use the ape's spacecraft to return to the virus' planet of origin, hoping to find an antidote. They find an urban environment where apes armed with heavy weapons hunt humans. The main villains were Lord Zaius and Colonel Ursus; in contrast to Dr. Zaius, Lord Zaius was very cruel to the humans. Landis and Troy discover the antidote and return to Earth, only to find in their 74-year absence that apes have taken over the planet. "The Statue of Liberty's once proud porcelain features have been crudely chiseled into the grotesque likeness of a great grinning ape".
Arnold Schwarzenegger remained attached, but Fox had mixed emotions with Hamm's script. When Columbus dropped out in late 1995 to work on "Jingle All the Way", Fox offered the director's position to Roland Emmerich in January 1996. James Cameron was in talks during the filming of "Titanic" as writer and producer. Cameron's version would have drawn elements from the original film and its sequel "Beneath the Planet of the Apes". After the financial and critical success of "Titanic", Cameron dropped out. After learning about his previous involvement, Chernin and Rothman met with Peter Jackson to learn about his original Renaissance idea. Jackson turned down directing the film with Schwarzenegger and Cameron as his producer, recognizing they would probably conflict over the direction. Schwarzenegger left to work on "Eraser". Michael Bay then turned down the director's position. Jackson again turned down the project while facing the possible cancellation of "The Lord of the Rings" in 1998, because he was unenthusiastic following Roddy McDowall's death. In mid-1999, the Hughes brothers were interested in directing but were committed to "From Hell".
Pre-production.
In 1999, William Broyles, Jr. turned down the chance to write the script, but decided to sign on "when I found out I could have an extensive amount of creative control". Fox projected the release date for July 2001, while Broyles sent the studio an outline and a chronicle of the fictional planet "Aschlar". Entitled "The Visitor" and billed as "episode one in the Chronicles of Aschlar", Broyles' script caught the attention of director Tim Burton, who was hired in February 2000. "I wasn't interested in doing a remake or a sequel of the original "Planet of the Apes" film," Burton said later. "But I was intrigued by the idea of revisiting that world. Like a lot of people, I was affected by the original film. I wanted to do a 're-imagining'." Richard D. Zanuck signed on as producer in March. "This is a very emotional film for me. I greenlighted the original "Apes" when I was the head of Fox in 1967."
Under Burton's direction, Broyles wrote another draft, but his script was projected at a $200 million budget. Fox wanted to cut it to $100 million. In August 2000, two months before principal photography, Fox brought Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal for rewrites. Broyles "had a lot of respect with the work they and Rosenthal did. And to think that given what I'd done and given what Tim wanted, they navigated the right course." One of the considered endings had Leo Davidson crash-landing at Yankee Stadium, witnessing apes playing baseball. Various alternatives were considered before the filmmakers decided on the final one. The production of "Planet of the Apes" was a difficult experience for Burton. This was largely contributed by Fox's adamant release date (July 2001), which meant that everything from pre-production to editing and visual effects work was rushed.
Konner and Rosenthal were rewriting the script even as sets were being constructed. Ari, Helena Bonham Carter's character, was originally a princess. She was changed to "a Senator's daughter with a liberal mentality". One of the drafts had General Thade, Tim Roth's character, as an albino gorilla, but Burton felt chimpanzees were more frightening. Limbo, Paul Giamatti's character "was supposed to turn into a good guy. There was supposed to be this touching personal growth thing at the end," Giamatti reflected. "But Tim and I both thought that was kind of lame so we decided to just leave him as a jerk into the end."
Filming.
Burton wanted to begin filming in October 2000, but it was pushed back to November 6, 2000 and ended in April 2001. Filming for "Planet of the Apes" began at Lake Powell, where parts of the original film were shot. Due to a local drought, production crews had to pump in extra water. The film was mostly shot at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California, while other filming locations included lava plains in Hawaii and Trona Pinnacles at Ridgecrest. To preserve secrecy, the shooting script did not include the ending. Stan Winston was the original makeup designer but left because of creative differences. Fox considered using computer-generated imagery to create the apes, but Burton insisted on using prosthetic makeup designed by Rick Baker. Baker was previously involved with Adam Rifkin's unproduced remake. Burton commented, "I have a relationship with both of them and Baker, so that decision was hard," he says. "Stan worked on "Edward Scissorhands" and Baker did Martin Landau's makeup Béla Lugosi in "Ed Wood"".
On his hiring, Baker explained, "I did the Dino De Laurentiis version of "King Kong" in 1976 and was always disappointed because I wasn't able to do it as realistically as I wanted. I thought "Apes" would be a good way to make up for that." In addition to "King Kong", Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on ', ', and the 1998 remake of "Mighty Joe Young". The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, "it's like going to the dentist at two in the morning and having people poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.
To compose the film score, Burton hired regular collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman had previously been set as composer when Adam Rifkin was to do his remake in 1989. Elfman noted that his work on "Planet of the Apes" contained more percussion instruments than usual.
Reaction.
Box office.
To help market "Planet of the Apes," Fox commissioned an Internet marketing campaign that also involved geocaching. Hasbro released a toy line, while Dark Horse Comics published a comic book adaptation. The original release date for the film was July 4, 2001. "Planet of the Apes" was released on July 27, 2001 in 3,500 theaters across North America, earning $68,532,960 in its opening weekend. This was the second-highest opening weekend of 2001, behind "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone". The film went on to gross $180,011,740 in North America and $182,200,000 elsewhere, for a worldwide total of $362,211,740. "Planet of the Apes" was the tenth-highest grossing film in North America, and ninth-highest worldwide, of 2001.
Critical reception.
The film received mixed reviews. Based on 155 reviews collected by the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 45% of the critics enjoyed "Planet of the Apes", with the site's consensus stating "This remake of "Planet of the Apes" can't compare to the original in some critics' minds, but the striking visuals and B-movie charms may win you over." By comparison, Metacritic calculated an average score of 50 out of 34 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews." Prominent critic Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film 2½ stars; he praised the twist ending, but felt the film lacked a balanced story structure. "The movie is great-looking. Rick Baker's makeup is convincing even in the extreme closeups, and his apes sparkle with personality and presence. The sets and locations give us a proper sense of alien awe," Ebert commented. "Tim Burton made a film that's respectful to the original, and respectable in itself, but that's not enough. Ten years from now, it will be the 1968 version that people are still renting." Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" gave a negative review. "Call it a letdown, worsened by the forces of shoddy screenwriting. To quote Heston in both films, 'Damn them, damn them all'."
Kenneth Turan of the "Los Angeles Times" believed "the actors in the nonhuman roles are mostly too buried by makeup to make strong impressions. Unfortunately, none of the good work counts as much as you'd think it would," Turan said. ""Planet of the Apes" shows that taking material too seriously can be as much of a handicap as not taking it seriously at all." Elvis Mitchell of "The New York Times" gave a more favorable review, feeling the script was balanced and the film served its purpose as "pure entertainment". Susan Wloszczyna of "USA Today" enjoyed "Planet of the Apes", feeling most of the credit should go to prosthetic makeup designer Rick Baker.
Much criticism was leveled against the ambiguous ending. Tim Roth, who portrayed General Thade, said "I cannot explain that ending. I have seen it twice and I don't understand anything." Helena Bonham Carter, who played Ari, said, "I thought it made sense, kind of. I don't understand why everyone went, 'Huh?' It's all a time warp thing. He's gone back and he realizes Thade's beat him there." Burton claimed the ending was not supposed to make any sense, but it was more of a cliffhanger to be explained in a possible sequel. "It was a reasonable cliffhanger that could be used in case Fox or another filmmaker wanted to do another movie," he explained.
The film was nominated for two BAFTA Awards, one for Best Make-up held by Rick Baker, the other for Best Costume Design. Roth (Supporting Actor), Carter (Supporting Actress), Colleen Atwood (Costume), and Rick Baker (Make-up) received nominations at the Saturn Awards. Atwood and Baker were nominated at the 55th British Academy Film Awards, while music composer Danny Elfman was nominated for his work at the 43rd Grammy Awards. "Planet of the Apes" won Worst Remake at the 22nd Golden Raspberry Awards, while Heston (Worst Supporting Actor) and Estella Warren (Worst Supporting Actress) also won awards.
Legacy.
Fox stated that if "Planet of the Apes" was a financial success, then a sequel would be commissioned. Although the film was indeed a financial success, Fox decided not to proceed with a sequel. When asked whether he would be interested in working on a follow-up, director Tim Burton replied, "I'd rather jump out a window." Mark Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter would have returned if Burton had decided to make another "Apes" film. Paul Giamatti had been interested in reprising his role. "I think it'd be great to have apes driving cars, smoking cigars," Giamatti said. "Wearing glasses, sitting in a board room, stuff like that." "Planet of the Apes" was the last film Burton worked on with his former fiancée Lisa Marie. After their relationship broke up, Burton started a relationship with Helena Bonham Carter, who portrayed Ari. "Planet of the Apes" was also Burton's first collaboration with producer Richard D. Zanuck.
Video game.
Fox Interactive produced a video game adaptation which, despite significant delays, was released for Windows, PlayStation, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance.
The PC and PlayStation version was created by Visiware Studios and published by Ubisoft and Fox Interactive on Windows and PlayStation respectively. The protagonist is Ulysses, an astronaut from present-day Earth who crash lands on the Planet of the Apes. The Windows version was released on September 19, 2001 and the PS1 version on June 28, 2002. It is a 3D Action-Adventure and Puzzle game. The PlayStation version differs from the PC version as it contains lower-quality graphics and the area of visibility is greatly reduced.
The GBA and GBC versions were developed by Torus Studios and released by Ubisoft on December 5, 2001 for GBA and on December 31, 2002 for GBC. They are different from the PC and PlayStation version as both of these are 2D side-scrolling adventure games and the protagonist is an astronaut named Ben.
All versions of the game received generally negative reviews.

English Cemetery, Naples

The English Cemetery, "Il Cimitero degli Inglesi", or more correctly, "Il Cimitero acattolico di Santa Maria delle Fede", is located near Piazza Garibaldi, Naples, Italy. It was the final resting place of many Swiss, Germans, Americans, Irish, Scottish and English who lived in Naples, were passing through on the Grand Tour, or were merchants or seamen.
History.
In 1826, the British Consul, Sir Henry Lushington, bought land within the gardens of the church of "Santa Maria della Fede" for a Protestant cemetery. The cemetery was the burial place of the (mainly foreign) Protestants who died in Naples, although people of other religions ended up here as well. It was a unique memorial to the foreigners who formed part of the commercial elite of Naples at that time.
The cemetery was closed for burials in 1893 and its maintenance given over to the British consulate. Over the following half-century what was once a romantic memory of the bourgeoisie of 18th-century Naples was scandalously allowed to fall into disrepair. Statues were vandalized and stolen and the entire cemetery became overgrown with weeds and vegetation. At the end of the 1950s the cemetery was donated to the Commune of Naples and a plan was drawn up for the re-utilization of the area. This foresaw the conversion of the cemetery into a public park, retaining some of the memorials as a reminder of the history of the cemetery and those interred in it. However, while most of the remaining land area of the cemetery was retained, only a fraction of the memorials were renovated and preserved, and the original ambience was almost obliterated in the construction of the public park.
Since its re-opening as a park in the early 1990s, some of the remaining memorials have been vandalized.
Burials and inscriptions.
When the cemetery was given by the British Consulate to the City of Naples the area was made over as a park. Most of the graves were transferred to the main municipal Cemetery of Poggioreale. However, records remain of those who were buried here in the 19th century, along with some inscriptions.
Notable burials.
Mary Somerville (née Fairfax) was a noted Scottish mathematician and theoretical astronomer of the nineteenth century. In the 1850s she and her husband came to Italy. Her husband died in 1860 in Florence and she moved to Naples. She experienced the 1872 eruption of Vesuvius in Naples, and died a few months later at the age of 92. Also buried in that grave are her daughters Martha, died 1879 and Mary, died 1875. Her memorial statue was the work of Francesco Jerace (1854–1937).
Dionysius Lardner was one of the most popular scientific writers of the 19th century. He was born in Dublin, Ireland. His "Cabinet Cyclopaedia" appeared in 1830 and was completed in 135 volumes in 1844. He was resident in Paris until shortly before his death, when he came to Naples and died there on 29 April 1859.
Davide Vonwiller (or Von Willer) was an industrialist from St. Gall in Switzerland. Through the textile business he became one of the richest inhabitants of the city. In the early 19th century Naples became the principal supplier to the Swiss, German and French textile industries, as a result of which many textile workers came from these countries to Naples. Also, the silk and cotton industries of Switzerland had been badly damaged by the blockage against Napoleon, and many entrepreneurs saw Naples as a way out of their predicament.
Anton Sminck van Pitloo (Arnhem 1790 - Naples 1837) was an influential Dutch painter who was invited to Naples in 1815 by a Russian diplomat. He was the originator of the Posillipo School in painting. He died during a cholera epidemic.

She was the second wife of George Coventry, 8th Earl of Coventry, with whom she eloped to Scotland in 1811. Shortly after their marriage she had affairs with two of George's younger brothers, amongst others.
William Gell (1777–1836) was an English archaeologist, traveller and writer. He was a friend of the Irish archaeologist Edward Dodwell and also of Keppel Richard Craven, with whom he lived towards the end of his life. 
Keppel Richard Craven (1779-1851) was an English traveller and dilettante and long-time friend of William Gell. Son of Elizabeth Craven and friend of Lady Blessington. In 1834 he bought a convent near Salerno where he generously entertained his friends and visitors.
Elizabeth Craven, Princess Berkeley and Margravine of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1750-1828) was an English socialite, playwright and travel writer. Twice married, she resided with her second husband, the Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach at Craven Villa in Posillipo.
Edward Arthur Butler, died 7 November 1829. The son of Frances Mauleverer 
and Colonel the Hon. Henry Edward Butler (1780-1856, second son of Henry Butler, 2nd Earl of Carrick). Edward was born at Carrick on Shannon, Leitrim, Ireland. His father served in Egypt and in the Peninsular War.
Lady Eleanor Butler (daughter of John Butler, 17th Earl of Ormonde and Lady Frances Susan Elizabeth Wandesford), died 27 September 1859, at Sorrento. 
Francis John Bateman-Dashwood, English nobleman, died 14 September 1861, is commemorated with an obelisk, the work of Francesco Jerace, who also designed two of the statues in the cemetery.

Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon

The Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, also called the Council of Mar Isaac, met in AD 410 in Seleucia-Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sassanid Empire of Persia. The council extended official recognition to the Empire's Christian community, known as the Church of the East, and established the Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon as its "Catholicos", or leader. It marked a major milestone in the history of the Church of the East and of Christianity in Asia in general.
The council was called by Mar Isaac, bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, and who was then declared as the primate of the Sassanid church, confirming him as Catholicos and Archbishop of all the Orient. The decision was substantial, as Christians in the Sassanid Empire up to that point were fairly disorganized and persecuted, and Zoroastrianism was instead the primary religion of the Empire. In 409, permission was formally given by the Zoroastrian King Yezdegerd to the Christians to even exist: to worship openly, and to rebuild destroyed churches, though they were not allowed to proselytize.
The Synod also declared its adherence to the decisions of the Council of Nicea and subscribed to the Nicene Creed.

Friedrich Weinbrenner

Friedrich Weinbrenner (Karlsruhe, 1766 – 1826) was a German architect and city planner admired for his mastery of classical style.
Birth and education.
Weinbrenner began life apprenticed to his father, a carpenter. He worked as a builder in Zürich and Lausanne starting from 1788. He arrived to Vienna in 1790 and began his study of architecture, largely self-taught. In 1790-91 he studied at the "Bauakademie" of Vienna and Dresden, then, in 1791-92, spent several months in Berlin where he was exposed to Palladian architecture. Carl Gotthard Langhans (1732–1808), David Gilly (1748–1808) and Hans Christian Genelli (1763–1823) were influential in the formation of Weinbrenner's architectural thought. He spent the years 1792 to 1797 in Italy, where he was part of the circle around Carl Ludwig Fernow (1763–1808) in Rome. His study of the ancient buildings of Rome, Pompeii, Herculaneum and, especially, Paestum were foundational to his later work. He was among the first German architects to see the early Doric buildings at Paestum.
Career.
Upon returning from Italy, Weinbrenner worked briefly in Strasbourg and Hanover, but established himself in Karlsruhe, where he would make his career as the official architect, working for both government and private clients. Karlsruhe was established in 1715 to replace a former capital and become the capital of the newly created Grand Duchy of Baden – now a central German state but then a sovereign principality. A generation of architects were trained under his supervision, and in 1825 he helped establish the Polytechnic School in Karlsruhe. With the architects he trained and the publication of his work, a "Weinbrenner style" of Classicism developed. Weinbrenner is, of course, the architect principally responsible for creating Karlsruhe as a Classical city and, beginning with his 1797 General Plan, for the development of the city plan with an official Protestant church (Stadtkirche) (1807–15), City Hall (1821–25) on the Triumphal Road leading to the Princely palace. Most of Weinbrenner's buildings were reconstructed in the 1950s following their destruction in the Second World War.

In the 1930s, Freer worked at Abbott's Magic in Colon, Michigan and performed under the name Alladin and later Doc Maxam.
Freer gained a reputation for performing effects like freezing ice in his bare hand. He also startled magicians some years ago by performing a suspension while standing in the middle of a floor entirely surrounded. It was captured on the cover of The Linking Ring, August 1941.
Winston Freer also published his occurrence classification of magic in International Brotherhood of Magicians magazine 'The Linking Ring' which classifies effects from the audiences' point of view.
Freer also fancied himself a mathematician. One of his most impressive creations was his Tile Puzzle. What makes it so interesting is that neither the pieces nor the frame change shape or size in any way.

Karl Heim

Karl Heim (20 January 1874 – 30 August 1958) was a professor of dogmatics at Münster and Tübingen. He retired in 1939. His idea of God controlling quantum events that do and would seem otherwise random has been seen as the precursor to much of the current studies on divine action. His current influence upon religion and science theology has been compared in degree to that of the physcist and theologian Ian Barbour and of the scientist and theological organizer Ralph Wendell Burhoe. His doctrine on the transcendence of God has been thought to anticipate important points of later religious and science discussions, including the application of Thomas Kuhn's idea of a paradigm to religion and Thomas F. Torrance's theory of multilevelled knowledge. Mention of Heim's physical and theological concept of extra-dimensional space can be found in a 2001 puzzle book by the popular mathematics writer Martin Gardner. His concept of space has also been discussed by Ian Barbour himself, who in a review of the book "Christian Faith and Natural Science" (English translation, 1953, Harper & Brothers) and in a mention of "its more technical sequel" "The Transformation of the Scientific World-View" (English translation, 1943, Harper & Brothers), found it to be "an illuminating insight."
Place amongst German scholars.
Until the late 1960s Karl Heim's call for a religion and science dialogue was a lone voice amongst German theologians. Within the realm of German scientists who were also Christian laity or religious proponents, Heim's views did however have contemporary company. So while German theologians Karl Barth and Rudolph Bultmann discouraged all types of interdisciplinary religious dialogue with science or any other intellectual discipline, scientists such as Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, Otto Hahn, Gunther Howe, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsacker readily participated in religion and science dialogues from the 1930s onward. In the 1960s Anglo-American Creationism-type religion and science dialogues (in particular young earth) began to be promoted by A.E. Wilder-Smith and others involved in the Karl-Heim-Gesellschaft (i.e., the Karl Heim Society).
Concept of spaces.
Heim's analog of spaces has been subject to some criticism. He appeared to use a scientific concept to create a new natural-supernatural relationship using a fourth dimension, which, in modern physics, cannot be visualized, and relates to mathematical and physical measurements and is always expressed as a mathematical equation.

Metropolitan Poor Act 1867

The Metropolitan Poor Act 1867 was an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, the first in a series of major reforms that led to the gradual separation of the Poor Law's medical functions from its poor relief functions. It also led to the creation of a separate administrative authority the Metropolitan Asylums Board.
The legislation provided that a single Metropolitan Poor Rate would be levied across the Metropolis: this being defined as the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Poor Law Board (a central government body) was empowered to form the areas of the various parish and poor law unions into districts for the provision of "Asylums for the Sick, Insane, and other Classes of the Poor".
An order was signed on 16 May 1867, combining all the parishes and unions in the Metropolis into a single Metropolitan Asylum District "for the reception and relief of the classes of poor persons chargeable to some union or parish in the said district respectively who may be infected with or suffering from fever, or the disease of small-pox or may be insane." The Metropolitan Asylums Board was established with 60 members: 45 elected by the various poor law boards of guardians and 15 nominated by the Poor Law Board.
The legislation amended the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 to allow control over parishes that had been excluded from it by local acts. The ten parishes were St James Clerkenwell, St George Hanover Square, St Giles and St George Bloomsbury, St Mary Islington, St James Westminster, St Luke, St Margaret and St John Westminster, St Marylebone, St Mary Newington and St Pancras.

Ganymede City is a term coined by Arthur C. Clarke in his science fiction novel, "". It refers to two regions, Lagash Sulcus and Memphis Facula, on the surface of one of Jupiter's moons, Ganymede. When viewed from space these regions have a criss-crossing pattern of what appears to be "streets and avenues". However these "streets and avenues" would be ten kilometers wide. Clarke said: "To my eyes it appears considerably more artificial than the notorious 'Mars Face' and its surroundings."
In the "Sources" section of his novel, "3001: The Final Odyssey", Clarke specifically referred to these two satellite images when speaking of "Ganymede City". They were taken by the "Voyager 2" probe and Clarke referred to them by their Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) numbers.

The Castle (film)

The Castle is a 1997 Australian comedy film directed by Rob Sitch. It starred Michael Caton, Anne Tenney, Stephen Curry, Sophie Lee, Eric Bana (in his first film) and Charles 'Bud' Tingwell. The screenwriting team comprised Sitch, Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner and Jane Kennedy of Working Dog Productions.
"The Castle" was filmed in 11 days on a budget of approximately . The film gained widespread acclaim in Australia and New Zealand, but was not widely distributed globally. It grossed A$10,326,428 at the box office in Australia and was Eric Bana's first film.
Plot.
The blue collar Kerrigan home is filled with love as well as pride in their modest lifestyle, but their happiness is threatened when developers attempt the compulsory acquisition of their house to expand the neighbouring Melbourne Airport.
The Kerrigan house is built in a largely undeveloped housing tract, on a toxic landfill, beneath power lines, and directly adjacent to an airport runway. Despite all this, sweet-natured family patriarch Darryl (Michael Caton) believes that he lives in the lap of luxury. Blissfully unaware of his family's lack of style or sophistication, he busies himself by driving a tow truck, racing greyhounds, and constantly adding tacky renovations to the house. The rest of the Kerrigan clan shares and supports his enthusiasm in every way.
One day, a property valuer arrives to inspect the house. Though he has no wish to sell, Darryl points out all the faults of the house, believing that the valuer is there to appraise the house for council rates. A few weeks later, he receives a letter informing him of the compulsory acquisition of his house for the sum of A$70,000. His neighbours all receive similar notices. Believing on common principle that the government cannot evict him unwillingly from his treasured home, Darryl attempts to fight the eviction. Agents from the airport try to bribe and bully the family into giving up, but their actions only stiffen the Kerrigans' resolve. Darryl hires an incompetent lawyer acquaintance, Dennis Denuto (Tiriel Mora), but Dennis' meagre argument that the eviction goes against "the vibe" of the Constitution does not go well in court. While awaiting the court's final decision, Darryl makes pleasant small talk with a man whom he meets outside the courthouse, Lawrence Hammill (Bud Tingwell), who has come to watch his son (a barrister) perform in court. The court rejects the family's appeal and gives them two weeks to vacate. The purchase price for the home is scarcely enough to cover a small apartment. Dejected in defeat, the family begins to pack.
A new breath of hope comes with the surprise arrival of Lawrence, who reveals himself as a retired Queen's Counsel. Lawrence has taken an interest in the Kerrigans' case and offers to argue before the High Court of Australia on their behalf, pro bono. Lawrence makes a persuasive case that the Kerrigans have the right to just terms of compensation for acquisition of property under Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution. He closes by paraphrasing Darryl's own comments that his house is more than just a structure of bricks and mortar, but a home built with love and shared memories. The court rules in favour of the Kerrigans, and their case becomes a landmark precedent on the subject. An epilogue shows that the Kerrigans continue to prosper happily, and Lawrence becomes a lasting friend of the family.
Background.
The humour in "The Castle" plays on the self image of Australians, most notably the concepts of working class Australians and their place in the modern Australia. The film title is named for the English saying, repeatedly used in the film, "a man's home is his castle". The film also refers to the land rights movement of the Australian Aborigines, with Darryl Kerrigan drawing an explicit parallel between his struggle and theirs. It also draws on one of the few rights protected in the Australian Constitution for subject matter, the right to just terms compensation for acquisition of property under s51(xxxi). Also interspersed in the film are many references to famous Australian Constitutional Law Cases, such as Mabo and the Tasmanian Dams Case. The film also deals with section 109 of the Constitution which provides that in the case of an inconsistency between Federal and State law, the Federal law shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
Production.
According to Santo Cilauro, the film took five weeks from original inception to final cut. The movie was written in two weeks, shot in ten days and taken to rough cut in two weeks.
"The Castle" was filmed mostly in Melbourne, Australia. The external shots of the Kerrigan household were shot at 3 Dagonet St, Strathmore, and airport footage was shot at Essendon Airport and Melbourne Airport. Location shots of Brunswick feature in the film, including Brunswick Town Hall and Rocky Porcino Pharmarcy at 720 Sydney Rd (Dennis's office). Melbourne's 200 Queen Street and the Supreme Court of Victoria are featured along with the High Court of Australia in Canberra. Some of the film is set in Bonnie Doon, and a very small portion of it was shot there.
The name Kerrigan was chosen for the family so that tow trucks for the film could be borrowed from an existing Melbourne tow truck company with that name. The company still operates today.
In January 2011, 3491 Maintongoon Road, Bonnie Doon was listed for sale. The property appeared in the film as the Kerrigan family holiday house. The property's real estate agent reported that many people called and after requesting the vendor's asking price, replied with a quote from the movie: "Tell him he's dreamin'."
Alternative versions.
In the US version, there were several minor changes to dialogue. "Rissole" was changed to "meatloaf", "two-stroke" was changed to "diesel", references to the Australian TV show "Hey Hey It's Saturday" were changed to "Funniest Home Videos", and the brand names of the various cars in the driveway were changed from Australian (Camira) to American ones (Corolla).
The Australian TV-Version for "before 8.30pm screening" has scenes of explicit language either completely cut, where possible, masked by aircraft noises or redubbed when lip movements are not visible. When broadcast after 8:30pm, all explicit language is intact.
Box office.
"The Castle" grossed A$10,326,428 at the box office in Australia, over 13 times its A$750,000 budget.
US rights were bought by Miramax for a rumoured $6 million.

The Biblioteca Ayacucho ("Ayacucho Library") is an editorial entity of the government of Venezuela, founded on September 10, 1974. It is managed by the "Fundación Biblioteca Ayacucho". Its name, "Ayacucho", comes from the intention to honor the definitive and crucial Battle of Ayacucho that took place December 9, 1824 between Spain and the territories of the Americas, prior to the full independence of the continent.
From the beginning the "Biblioteca" had its sights set on the classic works of all of Latin America and of all the branches of literary culture. It started with a Classical collection, with its first publication being "Doctrina del Libertador Simón Bolívar", by Venezuelan independence hero Simón Bolívar, in June 1976. Over time, the "Biblioteca" has developed several collections, as well as one of the most important Literary Dictionaries of Latin America, the "Diccionario Enciclopédico de las Letras de América Latina". 
Notable personalities of the intellectual and academic world of Latin America have participated in the formation and development of "Biblioteca Ayacucho", such as Ángel Rama and José Ramón Medina. Its director, as of today, is the Venezuelan writer Humberto Mata.
In March 2009 "Biblioteca Ayacucho" won three categories of the fifth Premio Nacional del Libro, including the category of digital publications, for the Biblioteca Ayacucho Digital. The Biblioteca Ayacucho Digital provides free online access to around 250 Venezuelan and Latin American books, ranging from recent publications to classics by authors such as Simón Bolívar.

Established in 1910, it is in size, with 38 hectares occupied by the Montreal Botanical Garden and Montreal Insectarium, by a nine-hole public golf course and the remaining hectares by public spaces. Originally the park contained an 18-hole golf course which was reduced to 9 holes in the mid-1970s in order to construct the Montreal Olympic Park.
Maisonneuve Park borders partially on Sherbrooke Street East.
It is named in honour of Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, founder of Montreal.
The park is a unique place where people enjoy walking day or night, bicycling on its bike trail which runs all the way around the park. The center of the park is a calm area where people enjoy picnics and tranquility and is very popular among young people and families.
The "loop" section of the bicycle path is long. This does not include the path outside the fenced area, along Sherbrooke St.

Night and Fog (1955 film)

Night and Fog () is a 1955 French documentary short film. Directed by Alain Resnais, it was made ten years after the liberation of Nazi death camps. The documentary features the abandoned grounds of Auschwitz and Majdanek while describing the lives of prisoners in the camps. "Night and Fog" was made in collaboration with scriptwriter Jean Cayrol, a survivor of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. The music of the soundtrack was composed by Hanns Eisler. 
Resnais was originally hesitant about making the film and refused the offer to make it until Cayrol was contracted to write the script. The film was shot entirely in the year 1955 and is composed of contemporary shots of the camps and stock footage. Resnais and Cayrol found the film very difficult to make due to its graphic nature and subject matter. The film faced difficulties with French censors unhappy with a shot of a French police officer in the film, and with the German embassy in France, which attempted to halt the film's release at the Cannes Film Festival. "Night and Fog" was released to very positive acclaim and still receives very high praise today. It was then re-shown in 1990, to remind the people of the 'horrors of war'.
Synopsis.
"Night and Fog" is a documentary that alternates between past and present and features both black and white and color footage. The first part of "Night and Fog" shows remnants of Auschwitz while the narrator Michel Bouquet describes the rise of Nazi ideology. The film continues with comparisons of the life of the Schutzstaffel to the starving prisoners in the camps. Bouquet then addresses the sadism inflicted upon the doomed inmates, including torture, scientific and medical 'experiments', executions, and prostitution. The next subject is shown completely in black and white and depicts images of gas chambers and piles of bodies. The final topic of the film depicts the liberation of the country, the discovery of the horror of the camps, and the questioning of who was responsible for them.
Production.
Development.
In 1954, the French publishing group Hachette released a book about eyewitness reports of deportation of the Jews. In November 1954, an exhibition of themes from the book was shown at Institut Pédagogique National in Paris. The historians Henri Michel and Olga Wormser proposed making a film in the context of their joint work in organizing this official exhibition to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the liberation of France. The first public notice of their project was given during a radio broadcast on November 10, 1954, the opening day of the exhibition.
Film producers Anatole Dauman, Samy Halfton and Philippe Lifchitz were invited to this exhibit and felt that a film should be made on the subject. Anatole Dauman, originally from Warsaw, undertook the production for Argos Films and arranged for co-financing by Films Polski, the Polish state production company. Dauman approached filmmaker Alain Resnais who had experience with documentary films since 1948. Resnais turned down the offer for over a week, feeling that only someone with first hand experience of concentration camps should attempt the subject matter.
The film was commissioned by two organizations: the Comité d'histoire de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, a government commission assigned the tasks of assembling documentary material on, and of launching historical inquiries and studies of, the period of the French occupation from 1940 to 1945. The other commissioner was the Réseau du souvenir, an association devoted to the memory of those deported to camps. A pre-production meeting was held on May 28, 1955, during the course of which it was decided "to explain clearly how the concentration-camp system (its economic aspect) flowed automatically from fascism". The film's working title, "Resistance and Deportation", was also changed to the French translation of the German term "Nacht und Nebel" ("Night and Fog"), which described handling of World War II prisoners according to a decree promulgated by Himmler on December 7, 1941. This provided that those resisting the Reich, arrested in their own countries, but not promptly executed, would be deported to camps in such a way that they would vanish without a trace, "into the night and fog". The title takes on yet another level of meaning a quarter of the way through the film, when Hanns Eisler's chilling score that has accompanied images of deportation is disrupted, as the train arrives at Auschwitz. The narrator observes that during the train ride "death makes its first choice" and "a second is made upon arrival in the night and fog." The visuals cut to a shot of trains arriving in night and fog, which has become a metaphor for the mystery of their situation.
Filming and scoring.
The film draws on several sources, including black-and-white still images from various archives, excerpts from older black-and-white films from French, Soviet, and Polish newsreels, footage shot by detainees of the Westerbork internment camp in the Netherlands, or by the Allies' "clean-up" operations and new colour and black-and-white footage filmed at concentration camps in 1955. He filmed his colour sequences in Eastmancolor rather than Agfacolor. Resnais uses the colour footage to contrast the desolate tranquility of several concentration camps—Auschwitz, Birkenau, Majdanek, Struthof, and Mathausen—with the horrific events that occurred there during World War II, to muse on the diffusion of guilt, and to pose the question of responsibility. The film also deals briefly with the prisoners' conditions, and shows disturbing footage of prisoners and dead victims in the camps. While Night and Fog states that the Nazis made soap from the corpses, giving the possible impression that this was done regularly, this claim is nowadays considered as untrue, with the exception of possible isolated cases. Researching the film was difficult for Resnais who would have nightmares from filming and found himself waking up screaming in the night. These nightmares passed as Resnais began filming in Auschwitz.
From the September 29 to October 4, 1955, Resnais and his crew filmed at Auschwitz-Birkenau. From there, scenes were shot at Majdanek from October 7 to the 10th. For the archival material, Resnais had to use black and white footage and did not receive any from English, German or French military sources. Some of the stock footage in the film is from Michel and Wormser's exhibit. Other stock footage is from the Rijksinstituut voor Oorlogsdokumentatie from the Netherlands, and from French television, Gaumont, and the association of former deportees. Cayrol was aided by mutual friend and film maker Chris Marker while writing the commentary that was spoken by actor Michel Bouquet. After viewing the images in the editing room, Cayrol became sick to his stomach and was unable to write further. Marker's contribution was to adapt the written text to the rhythm of the images in the film. While editing the film, Resnais felt a feeling of general discomfort, stating that he "had scruples, knowing that making the film more beautiful would make it more moving - it upset me".
Composer Hanns Eisler was invited to compose the music to "Night and Fog" by Argos Films on October 18, 1955 offering Eisler 200,000 francs and help in obtaining a visa to enter France. Eisler agreed to do it by telegram on October 25. The overture in the score had been written before Eisler was offered work on the film. It had originally been written for Bertold Brecht's play "Winterschlacht". Eisler's inspiration for this piece was Horatio's monologue from "Hamlet" which Eisler had read in Karl Kraus' "Weltgericht".
Post-production and censorship.
After the film was complete, producer Dauman told Resnais that he was "delighted to have produced the film", but that he guaranteed that "It will never see a theatrical release". In December 1955, French censors wanted some scenes cut from "Night and Fog". The end of the film shows scenes of bodies being bulldozed into mass graves. These were considered too violent to be allowed in the film. Another point of contention was that Resnais had included photographs of French officers guarding a detention center, operated by the Vichy government and located in central France, where Jews were gathered before Deportation. This scene prompted a call demanding that the shot be cut because it "might be offensive in the eyes of the present-day military". Resnais resisted this censorship, insisting that images of collaboration were important for the public to see. When Resnais refused to cut the scene with the officer, the censors pressured that they would cut off the last ten minutes of his film. Finally, to compromise, Resnais stated that obscuring the scene wouldn't change the meaning of the film to him, and he painted a beam that obscured the képi the officer was wearing. In exchange, Resnais would be allowed to show the bodies at the end of the film, which was restored to its original form for a 2003 DVD release.
The second act of censorship in the film was a huge scandal with the German embassy in France asking for the film to be withdrawn from the Cannes Film Festival. The French press reacted against the proposed withdrawal, noting that Cayrol and Resnais were very cautious in defining the difference between the Nazi criminals and the German people. Articles were written in French magazines including "Libération" and "L'Humanité," protesting any censorship of the film at Cannes. One of the few writers who supported the withdrawal, Jean Dutourd, felt that Auschwitz and other concentration camps should be forgotten.
Release.
A local association of deported prisoners insisted the film be shown at Cannes, threatening to occupy the screening room in their camp uniforms unless the festival showed the film. On 26 April 1956 the film was announced to be shown out of competition at Cannes. "Night and Fog" was shown in commercial theaters in Paris, in May 1956. The film was awarded the Jean Vigo Prize, a French award for young filmmakers.
Critical reception.
The film received very high acclaim in France on its initial release. Jacques Doniol-Valcroze wrote in "Cahiers du Cinéma" that the film was a powerful work comparable to work of artists Francisco Goya and Franz Kafka. French film critic and director François Truffaut referred to "Night and Fog" as the greatest film ever made.
Modern reception has also been positive. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100% of critics had given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 14.
Ironically, as Nitzan Lebovic pointed out, the film was not received as well in Israel; Resnais's universalist approach drew some criticism that reached the Israeli Knesset (the Israeli Parliament), immediately after its arrival, in 1956. A political debate opened around the film, dividing supporters and opponents between religious and secular, Ashkenazi and Sepharadi, right wing and left wing, or–as Lebovic showed–between center and radicals from both ends of the political map. A centrist demand to ban the film resulted with a small and a limited release until the end of the 1970s.
Home media.
"Night and Fog" was shown on French television as early as April 26, 1959. On May 10th, 1990 a Jewish cemetery at Carpentras was desecrated and the body of a freshly buried man, Felix Germont, impaled on a stake. Response was strong to this act, including having "Night and Fog" broadcast on all three of the French national television channels at the same time. The film has been shown as a teaching tool in schools in France since 1991.
Alan Pakula studied "Night and Fog" when he was writing the film adaptation of "Sophie’s Choice," William Styron's novel about a Polish-Catholic survivor of Auschwitz. 
A DVD of "Night and Fog" was released by The Criterion Collection on June 23, 2003. It restores the scene of the French officer that was censored in France on the film's initial release.

Cardiobacterium hominis

Cardiobacterium hominis is a Gram-negative rod commonly grouped with other bacteria into the HACEK group. It is one of several bacteria normally present in the respiratory tract. However, it may also rarely cause endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves.
Microbiology.
"C. hominis" is a catalase-negative, oxidase-positive, indole-producing Gram-negative rod. Its morphology has classically been described as highly pleomorphic and irregularly staining, although homogeneous bacilli with uniform shapes may be seen with the addition of yeast extract.
Antibiotic sensitivity.
Historically "C. hominis" has been sensitive to penicillin and penicillin derivatives such as ampicillin. However, penicillin-resistant strains, including those that produce beta-lactamases, have been described with increasing frequency. Clinical guidelines thus recommend that "C. hominis" and other HACEK organisms be presumed to harbor ampicillin resistance and therefore be treated with a third-generation cephalosporin. "C. hominis" and other HACEK organisms also exhibit "in vitro" susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and aztreonam. "C. hominis" is often resistant to erythromycin.

Black (2005 film)

Black is a 2005 Indian drama film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and starred by Rani Mukerji and Amitabh Bachchan. "Black" revolves around a blind and deaf girl, and her relationship with her teacher who himself later develops Alzheimer's disease. The film draws inspiration from Helen Keller's life and struggle. 
The film was screened at the Casablanca Film Festival and the International Film Festival of India. It won the Filmfare Award for best film. "Time Magazine" (Europe) selected the film as one of the 10 Best Movies of the Year 2005 from across the globe. The movie was positioned at number five. "Indiatimes Movies" ranks the movie amongst the "25 Must See Bollywood Films".
Plot.
The film begins with Michelle McNally (Rani Mukerji), a blind and deaf woman, visiting her former teacher Debraj Sahai (Amitabh Bachchan), who now has Alzheimer's disease, in a hospital. The film then flashbacks to the past to her childhood.
Michelle was a girl who lost her eyesight and hearing after recovering from an illness at the age of two and exists in a black world where she is isolated in the darkness of her own existence, trapped by her inability to see, hear and express. She grows up becoming more and more frustrated by the black and dark world around her, making her a violent, uncontrollable eight-year old child. Her parents, Paul and Catherine, are at their wits' end trying to control her, until one day the light shines through the end of the tunnel.
Debraj Sahai enters their lives, an elderly alcoholic teacher for the deaf and blind, Debraj sees himself as a magician and is a disillusioned eccentric man. He takes it upon himself to bring young Michelle into the light. He uses harsh methods, although always for Michelle's long-term benefit. Initially, his methods are met with disapproval by Michelle's father, who asks Debraj to leave. Although her father thinks he is gone, Debraj stays as the teacher while her father is away on business for 20 days. Her mother grudgingly approves of his continuation given her fear of Michelle being sent to an asylum. By the 20th day, Debraj manages to teach Michelle some words and better manners, but he has difficulty teaching her the meaning of words. When Michelle's father returns, Debraj packs his bags. At the very last moment, as he is walking towards the door suitcase in hand, Debraj gets frustrated with Michelle's continuing insolent behaviour and he throws her into a fountain full of water. Michelle suddenly takes to Debraj's lessons at that moment and begins to understand meaning. She is able to recognise her mother and father, and can vocalise the first syllables of some words. The McNallys decide to keep Debraj as Michelle's teacher.
Many years later, Michelle has learned a great deal, becoming relaxed and expressive, and she is even able to dance and expertly sign. Debraj convinces the Principal of a university to grant her an interview which she passes and gets admission to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree, the first deaf-blind person to do so at that university. Michelle moves away from home and lives with Debraj and one of her servants. Over the next 2 years, she struggles to gain her Bachelor of Arts degree, failing year after year, but she still maintains her spirit. One reason is that she must rely on Debraj completely for interpretation of the material and studying. This problem is overcome by the Principal of the school preparing the whole first-year Arts course of study in Braille. Another reason for her continuing failure is that her typing skills are lacking and typing is her only way to write down what she knows during exams. However, she also soon overcomes this deficiency through another flash of increased competence when she almost quits the university and gets into an argument with Debraj.
At the same time as Michelle suffers through and triumphs over her challenges, we also witness numerous other changes. Debraj begins to succumb to Alzheimer's, first forgetting the way out of the Principal's office and then forgetting Michelle and leaving her stranded during an ice cream celebration for her improved typing. We also see Michelle reconcile with her sister Sara, who we find out was jealous of her parents' affection for Michelle throughout her life. After attending Sara's wedding, Michelle begins to wonder about love, which she has not experienced, and she even asks Debraj to kiss her on the lips. Debraj reluctantly does so but decides to leave Michelle on her own because of this demand and the position she has put him in. Twelve years after enrolment, Michelle does manage to gain her BA, and with her proud parents looking on her, she even gives a speech to the graduating class. Wearing no black graduation robe, she thanks her parents and her teacher and she announces that she will only wear the robe so that her teacher may see her first.
Debraj is in a mental hospital due to his almost complete inability to remember his past and even how to speak. Michelle visits him wearing her robe and we see glimmers of memory return as Debraj realises that she has graduated and even does a victory dance. As the window opens to the rain outside, we see Debraj's hand in Michelle's reaching into the rain, and we hear the teacher-student pair say the first syllable of the word "water", with echoes of the scene in which Michelle first begins understanding the meaning of words earlier in the movie. However this time, it is Debraj who is beginning to learn to speak and understand.
The movie ends with a scene of Michelle amongst a crowd of people all dressed in black carrying candles walking towards a church. There is a voiceover of a letter Michelle has written to Debraj's friend Mrs Nair explaining that today was her teacher's first day of school, and that like hers, his alphabet began with "B L A C K"
Production.
Sanjay Leela Bhansali first came up with the idea for "Black" in 1995 while filming "". He was inspired by Helen Keller's autobiography "The Story of My Life" and visited the Helen Keller Institute to do research. He also read the autobiography of deaf-mute pianist Geraldine Lawhorn for ideas. Much of the film was based on his observations between students, teachers and parents at the Institute. Bhansali originally planned for the film to be a low-budget film in Hindi and English which would provide a change from his prior film, the expensive "Devdas". 
A self-described "diehard fan" of Amitabh Bachchan since he was a child, Bhansali was able to cast him after Bachchan watched "Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam" and approached him about starring in one of his films. When Bhansali first approached Rani Mukherjee to play the role of Michelle McNally, she declined because she believed it was too challenging for her. To prepare for his role, Bachchan watched documentaries. Rani Mukherjee wore coloured contacts to give her the appearance of a blind girl and both Bachchan and Mukherjee studied sign language and Braille for seven months. A team of deaf-blind students were also on set advising the actors and instructing them in sign language.
The film was shot in Mumbai and in Shimla. Parts of pre-independence Shimla, were recreated by production designer Omung Kumar, who later with Bhansali on "Saawariya" (2007), in Film City, Kamalistan Studios and Mehboob Studios across Mumbai. The sets of "Black" were closed to prevent details about the film from leaking. The cast and crew experienced many difficulties during the film's shooting. During filming in February 2004 a fire broke out at the Mumbai set, destroying costumes and props. The fire was started in the night when a plug sparked and ignited. Bhansali was forced to start the indoor sets from scratch. Also, during the outdoor shoot in Shimla the script required snow but there was none so the crew brought in snowmaking machines from Mumbai and created a man-made snowy landscape. Permission to shoot at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study's Viceregal Lodge was initially denied, delaying the film further.
Constantly on the sets of this movie was 'Zamir Dhale' – somebody who is blind and deaf. He stayed in Shimla during the time of the shooting to help Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee understand the world of the blind and the deaf. He also taught them the usage of sign language and how to communicate with such people.
Release.
"Black" was originally scheduled to be released on 10 December 2004, but Bhansali decided to postpone its release. "Black" was released on 4 February 2005 in 170 different towns in India, a small number compared to most large-budget Bollywood films. "Black" was also screened at several international film festivals like the Casablanca Film Festival.
Critical reception.
"Black" was met by mostly positive reviews. Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukerji bagged the filmfare critic's acting awards also, besides the best actor and actress awards. The performances of Amitabh Bachchan, Rani Mukerji and Ayesha Kapoor were especially praised by critics. Richard Corliss of "Time" magazine selected it as one of the best films of 2005. It was also listed at number one on the "Indiatimes"' list of "25 Must See Bollywood Movies".
Box office.
"Black" grossed around making it the eleventh highest grossing Bollywood film of 2005. It was designated as an "average" financial success by Box Office India In addition, "Black" earned approximately $754,819 in the US and £473,862 in the UK.
Black had overseas gross of US$ 7.40 million.
Music.
A. R. Rahman was originally roped in to score the music, but he had to refuse due to busy schedules. The film's music is composed by Monty Sharma. Unlike many other Bollywood films, "Black" has only one song, "Haan maine chookar dekha hain", performed by Gayatri Ganjawala.

Operation LAC

Operation LAC (Large Area Coverage), was a U.S. Army Chemical Corps operation which dispersed microscopic zinc cadmium sulfide (ZnCdS) particles over much of the United States. The purpose was to determine the dispersion and geographic range of biological or chemical agents.
Earlier tests.
There were several tests that occurred prior to the first spraying affiliated with Operation LAC that proved the concept of large area coverage. Canadian historical files relating to participation in the tests cite in particular three previous series of tests leading up to those to conducted in Operation LAC. 
In addition, the Army admitted to spraying in Minnesota locations from 1953 into the mid-1960s.
Operation.
Operation LAC was undertaken in 1957 and 1958 by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps. Principally, the operation involved spraying large areas with zinc cadmium sulfide. The U.S. Air Force loaned the Army a C-119, "Flying Boxcar", and it was used to disperse zinc cadmium sulfide by the ton in the atmosphere over the United States. The first test occurred on December 2, 1957 along a path from South Dakota to International Falls, Minnesota.
The tests were designed to determine the dispersion and geographic range of biological or chemical agents. Stations on the ground tracked the fluorescent zinc cadmium sulfide particles. During the first test and subsequently, much of the material dispersed ended up being carried by winds into Canada. However, as was the case in the first test, particles were detected up to 1,200 miles away from their drop point. A typical flight line covering 400 miles would release 5,000 pounds of zinc cadmium sulfide and in fiscal year 1958 around 100 hours were spent in flight for LAC. That flight time included four runs of various lengths, one of which was 1,400 miles.
Specific tests.
The December 2, 1957 test was incomplete due to a mass of cold air coming down from Canada. It carried the particles from their drop point and then took a turn northeast, taking most of the particles into Canada with it. Military operators considered the test a partial success because some of the particles were detected 1,200 miles away, at a station in New York state. A February 1958 test at Dugway Proving Ground ended similarly. Another Canadian air mass swept through and carried the particles into the Gulf of Mexico. Two other tests, one along a path from Toledo, Ohio to Abilene, Texas, and another from Detroit, to Springfield, Illinois, to Goodland, Kansas, showed that agents dispersed through this aerial method could achieve widespread coverage when particles were detected on both sides of the flight paths.
Scope.
According to Leonard A. Cole, an Army Chemical Corps document titled "Summary of Major Events and Problems" (1958), p.108-110 described the scope of Operation LAC. Cole stated that the document outlined that the tests were the largest ever undertaken by the Chemical Corps and that the test area stretched from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, and from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Other sources describe the scope of LAC varyingly, examples include, "Midwestern United States", and "the states east of the Rockies". Specific locations are mentioned as well. Some of those include: a path from South Dakota to Minneapolis, Minnesota,Dugway Proving Ground, Corpus Christi, Texas, north-central Texas, and the San Francisco Bay area.
Risks and issues.
Bacillus globigii was used to simulate biological warfare agents (such as Anthrax), because it was then considered a contaminant with little health consequence to humans however, BG is now considered a human pathogen.
Anecdotal evidence exists of ZnCdS having adverse health effects as a result of LAC. However, a U.S. government study, done by the U.S. National Research Council stated, in part, "After an exhaustive, independent review requested by Congress, we have found no evidence that exposure to zinc cadmium sulfide at these levels could cause people to become sick." Still, the use of ZnCdS remains controversial and one critic accused the Army of "literally using the country as an experimental laboratory".

<doc id="20182167" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20182167" title="Bennett Amendment">
Bennett Amendment

The Bennett Amendment is a provision in §703(h) of Title VII of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 incorporating specific terms of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to more clearly define under what circumstances an employer may provide different compensation to employees of different sex. The Amendment has invited debate on the extent to which it impacts the question of "comparable worth", including whether or not lawsuits may be brought when jobs are different, but judged by contrast on an importance continuum to jobs of higher pay. In 1981 the Supreme Court of the United States determined with respect to "County of Washington v. Gunther" that the Bennett Amendment explicitly incorporated only limited defenses to unequal pay and did not otherwise bar suits based on a comparison of payment for different jobs. Nevertheless, it has continued to be used to bar comparable worth suits in lower courts.
Background.
While Title VII forbids employers to discriminate against employees on the basis of sex, the Bennett Amendment (proposed as Public Law 88-38 on June 10, 1963) provides exception, specifically noting that:
It shall not be an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining the amount of the wages or compensation paid or to be paid to employees of such employer if such differentiation is authorized by the provisions of section 206(d) of title 29 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.
§206(d) of the Equal Pay Act allows differentiation of payment on (1) seniority, (2) merit, (3) productivity, or (4) any other factor than sex.
According to 2004's "Employee Benefits Law", the Amendment was proposed by Wallace F. Bennett, a Republican Senator from Utah as a "'technical' amendment" to bring the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act into accord.
Comparable worth debate.
Arthur Gutman in 1999's "EEO Law and Personnel Practices" describes comparable worth as a system of ranking jobs on "a continuum of value to the company", allowing, for example, that while one job may be worth $10 an hour, a job of slightly less complexity might be worth $8. Evaluating this continuum provides an "internal worth", indicative of the value of the job to a particular company, which may be compared to an "external worth", or the value of a job to the wider market.
The impact of the Bennett Amendment on the comparable worth debate has been a point of contention. In 1989, Ellen Frankel Paul summarized the matter in "Equity and Gender: The Comparable Worth Debate", by posing two questions: "Does the Bennett Amendment plug into Title VII all of the Equal Pay Act's standards, thus importing the "equal work" standard of the latter? Or does it merely inject the Equal Pay Act's four exceptions...?" Paul notes that the question is pivotal to resolving the Comparable Worth Debate, for if it is interpreted to incorporate the entirety of the Equal Pay Act's standards, then it becomes impossible to prove a "comparable worth" suit, defining two different jobs in a scale of importance and determining by it how to judge equal pay. 
County of Washington vs. Gunther.
The Supreme Court of the United States first examined the question of the impact of the Bennett Amendment in the 1981 case "County of Washington v. Gunther", 452 U.S. 161. The case originated in 1974 when a group of four female county prison guards sued the County of Washington for unequal wages, alleging that their pay was less than that of male guards for no reason other than sexual discrimination. The district court disagreed, finding that male guards were responsible for overseeing more prisoners and also that female guards spent some of their time in clerical tasks, but also found as a matter of law that a sex-based wage discrimination claim cannot be brought under Title VII unless it satisfies the equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act of 1963.
While not reviewing the first finding, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held with respect to the latter that "claims for sex-based wage discrimination can also be brought under Title VII even though no member of the opposite sex holds an equal but higher paying job, provided that the challenged wage rate is not exempted under the Equal Pay Act's affirmative defenses as to wage differentials attributable to seniority, merit, quantity or quality of production, or any other factor other than sex." It interpreted the intention of the Amendment as incorporating "into Title VII only the affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act, not its prohibitory language requiring equal pay for equal work." With this finding, by a narrow margin, the US Supreme Court concurred. Justice Brennan, speaking for the Court, indicated that the Bennett Amendment did not preclude comparison of differences in pay, but only those attributable to those four specific factors.
"Gunther", however, did not prove as definitive on the question as first believed, both because it did not address all factors under consideration and because it was a narrow decision. The Court did not determine how jobs might be properly compared, and one of the primary opponents of the majority opinion was the soon-to-be Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist. Rehnquist wrote explicitly against the comparable worth theory in his dissent (speaking as well for Warren E. Burger, Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and Potter Stewart), while Brennan countered that the majority opinion was not explicitly or implicitly supporting or refuting the comparable worth doctrine. Gutman underscored that "the "Gunther" ruling did "not" validate comparable worth theory; it merely permitted plaintiffs to "try" to make the prima facie claim under Title VII rules" and added that "o far plaintiffs have been thwarted in every case."

Sarsuna satellite township

Sarsuna Satellite Township (also known as Shakuntala Park Housing Estate) is a township located in Southwest Kolkata, and forms part of the greater Behala region in the Indian state of West Bengal.
Location.
This Township is 12 Kilometers from Raj Bhavan / Esplanade, Kolkata, West Bengal, India ( Central Kolkata) . Township is under Kolkata Corporation area in ward number 127. This is called Behala area of Kolkata. One of the oldest place in Kolkata. Owner of Kolkata, the land lord SABARNA CHOWDHURY's residence was here, in a place called Barisha . Jab Charnak, the representative of British East India Company came to this place to take lease of three villages ( Sutanuti, Gobindapur and Kolkata ) more than 300 years back for the business purposes.This is Calcutta now and first Capital of British India. 
This Township is reachable through Diamond Harbour Road .After Behala market, reach Behala Chowrasta, then take right turn through Ho Chi Minh Sarani ( Formally known as Biren Roy Road ( WEST ). The Road is now well maintained and wide. The Township is about 3.0 KM from Behala Chowrasta. Several Buses and Auto services are available from Behala Chowrasta. It starts two kilometers from Behala Chowrasta ( Second Phase of township)and name of the place/ bus stand is Shakuntala Park. And extends to nearly another kilometer or more,till end of First phase of the Township. It is a predominantly Bengali neighborhood, but many South Indians, Goans, Biharis and Oriyas reside in the area. It is bordered by Shakuntala Park area (Patton Tank Factory) in the east and Kethopole to the west. The main road is Ho-Chi-Minn Sarani. But known most as Biren Roy Road ( WEST ).
The area was rural prior to the construction of this Township by West Bengal Housing Board . Many families are living here since centuries . 
West Bengal Housing Board constructed this Township mainly for middle class service people of different groups, like Higher Income group, Middle income group, Lower income group and economically weaker group. 
The West Bengal Housing Board developed the township for residential purposes, selling vacant plots (2K and 3K series), pre-constructed houses (H2, H1, M1, L and E schemes) and 4-story apartments. "H" denotes for Higher, "M" for middle, "L" for lower and "E" for economically weaker group people. The township is divided into 2 phases.In 1985 first allotment started through news paper advertisements. Hundred Engineers, Hundred Doctors, Few IAS and IPS officers, Bank employes and from government and private organizations people came here with their new houses or plots.Now after 26 years, in 2012, many of them are retired and their next generations are in many places in India and all over the world now. A part of this Township is now like old age home... 
But sorry to say that there are also some abandoned house which are not use for resident purpose but treat as a property for higher income for luxurious peoples.The co-operative society see all those things but helpless to solve the problems.
Some anti socials are using the house No H2/112 and others for their anti social work but the secretary/authority of the co operative society don't bother for all those things.because they are all old aged people.

Some of them decorate their frontal boundary with the various type of flower plants in tubs.
it is very nice to walking beside the house,the old age people walking there morning and evening.
but other side you also see that some abandoned hose like ghost house. The college students are roaming freely with their friends in this area.
The area is under the jurisdiction of Thakurpukur Police Station, which is a part of the South Zone of the Kolkata Police Department. The Shakuntala Park police outpost is situated inside the township.
Three lakes (Lake No. 1, 2, and 3 respectively) are within half a kilometer of the township. Lake 1 is maintained by Kolkata Corporation with a park and walking path all around, although the other lakes are not maintained and are used as fishery . During "Chhat Puja" Biharis assemble at the lake to offer puja.

Martim Soares Moreno

Martim Soares Moreno, born around 1586 in Santiago do Cacém, Kingdom of Portugal, was a Portuguese explorer who defended the interests of the Portuguese crown in the colony of Brazil, fighting French pirates and Dutch invaders during decades.
His uncle, Diogo de Campos Moreno says that "he was sent very young with Pêro Coelho de Sousa, so that while serving in that expedition he could learn the language of the Indians, and their customs, devoting himself to them, and making himself very familiar, and a relative or friend to them, as they say." He participated in the Pêro Coelho expedition to Ceará in 1603 and ended up becoming, years later (1612), the virtual founder of that colony. There he built, on the river Ceará, a fort and a chapel, with the help of the Indians that he brought from Rio Grande do Norte.
That same year, on the orders of Jerónimo de Albuquerque Maranhão, he reconnoitered Maranhão, occupied by the French, who had stirred up the people of that land. On his return, however, his ship was driven by the wind to the Antilles. In 1614 he was in Seville, in Spain.
The next year, now a captain, he returned to Maranhão, together with reinforcements of 900 men, which made possible the definitive expulsion of the French and the capture of the city of São Luís. In 1616 he was captured on the high seas by a French Corsair, after a violent battle that left him seriously wounded with a cut on the face and the loss of a hand.
The charter letter of May 26, 1619 made him lord of the captaincy of Ceará, in thanks for his services. There, in 1624 and 1625, he repelled the attacks of two Dutch ships.
In 1630 he dedicated himself to fighting the Dutch invasion of Pernambuco. He left Ceará with a few Indians and soldiers and arrived at the Arraial do Bom Jesus in June 1631. In the initial phase of the fight, he took part in the blockade of the Dutch forces in Recife and Olinda. He always distinguished himself, as a combatant and interpreter with the Indians. In subsequent years he took part in the defense of Paraíba and of Cunhaú (in Rio Grande do Norte).
The Dutch having defeated the Portuguese colonial resistance, and the Portuguese Monarchy having been restored in 1640, a truce was signed between Portugal and the Netherlands. Nevertheless, in 1645, Martim Soares Moreno took part in the clandestine movement that ended with the expulsion of the Dutch from Brazilian territory.
In culture.
His life served as the historical basis for José de Alencar's novel Iracema.

Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence

NATO CCD COE, officially the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence () is one of NATO Centres of Excellence, located in Tallinn, Estonia. The Centre was established on 14 May 2008, it received full accreditation by NATO and attained the status of International Military Organisation on 28 October 2008. The Centre conducts research and training on cyber security and includes a staff of approximately 40 persons.
History.
In 2003, prior to the country’s official accession to NATO, Estonia proposed the creation of a "cyber excellence center". The 2006 Riga summit listed possible cyber attacks among the asymmetric threats to the common security and acknowledged the need for programs to protect information systems over the long term. The cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 highlighted for the first time the potential vulnerability of any NATO countries, their institutions and societies, and even NATO itself to disruption or penetration of their information and communications systems.
Estonia’s proposals for a NATO cyber excellence center received strong support from the alliance’s Secretary-General "Jaap" de Hoop Scheffer. NATO completed an assessment of the situation, partly in light of Estonia’s experience, in April 2007, and approved a NATO policy on cyber defence in January 2008. NATO’s summit communiqué in Bucharest in April announced NATO’s readiness to "provide a capability to assist allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack".
Overview.
The Cyber Defence Center in Tallinn is one of 18 accredited Centres of Excellence (COEs), for training on technically sophisticated aspects of NATO operations. It is being funded nationally and multi-nationally as these centers are closely linked with Allied Command Transformation and promote the alliance-approved transformation goals.
The main agenda of the facility is to:
The centre has also other responsibilities which include:
Current status.
There are currently 11 countries involved within the centre:
NATO CCD COE's Founding Nations are Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Spain. Hungary, Poland, the United States and the Netherlands joined in the following years.
Membership at the NATO CCD COE is open to all NATO nations. Turkey, France and United Kingdom are expected to join by 2014. Additionally Iceland has also shown interest in joining the NATO CCD COE.
NATO CCD COE can also establish cooperative relations with non-NATO nations, universities, research institutions, and businesses as Contributing Participants.

<doc id="20182467" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20182467" title="Scottish Human Rights Commission">
Scottish Human Rights Commission

The Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC) is the national human rights institution for Scotland. It was established by an Act of the Scottish Parliament and started its work in 2008. The Commission is independent of Government, and of the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments. It seeks to promote and protect the human rights of everyone in Scotland, working to increase awareness, recognition and respect for human rights, and make them more relevant and easier to apply in everyday life. The Commission aims to help everyone understand their rights and the shared responsibilities everyone has to each other and to their community. 
The SHRC has offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow. It is a SPCB supported body meaning that it is separate and independent from Government but still accountable for its public funds. The chairman of the Commission is Professor Alan Miller.
The Scottish Human Rights Commission is the newest of the three national human rights institutions (NHRIs) in the United Kingdom and, like the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), it has secured "A status" accreditation from the International Co-ordinating Committee of NHRIs (the ICC). The Scottish Parliament, when establishing the Commission in 2008, ensured that it complied with United Nations Principles Related to the Status of National Institutions, known as the Paris Principles - a series of recommendations on the role, status and functions of NHRIs. The Commission has a strong international profile and can participate in parallel reporting mechanisms for UN treaty processes. In October 2010 it hosted the biennial world conference of NHRIs in Edinburgh. The Commission was elected as Chair of the European Group of National Human Rights Institutions during a meeting in Geneva on 17 May 2011.
Mandate.
The Commission must lay annually before the Scottish Parliament a general report on the exercise of its functions during the year. Issues concerning equality, and some non-devolved human rights matters, are the responsibility of the EHRC. The SHRC, NIHRC and EHRC participate with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland in the "independent mechanism" to promote, protect and monitor implementation in the UK of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Powers.
The Scottish Commission was established by the Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006, an Act of the Scottish Parliament. The legislation sets out 
The Commission is under a duty to ensure it is not duplicating work that others already carry out. It cannot provide assistance to any person in connection with a legal claim. Assistance includes advice, guidance and grants.
Commissioners.
The Commission is Chaired by Professor Alan Miller (who was appointed by a vote of the Scottish Parliament). There are also three part time Commissioners: 
A previous Commissioner, John McNeill, was named as the new Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland on 17 August 2009. 
Work of the Commission.
The Commission is currently working from its Strategic Plan 2012-2016. The strategic priorities for this time period are as follows:
1. Empowering people to realise their rights through promoting greater awareness and respect for human rights.
2. Supporting the implementation of human rights in practice.
3. Improving human rights protection in Scotland through influencing law and policy.
4. Progressing the realisation of human rights of people in Scotland and beyond through further developing our international role. 
5. Ensuring the Commission is effective, efficient, professional and accountable. 
The Commission presented its first Strategic Plan to the Scottish Parliament in June 2009, after a national consultation which took in a wide range of responses from civic society, individuals, public authorities and representatives from local and national government. It identified its key priorities as promoting and protecting human dignity in Scotland, addressing emerging human rights issues, bringing human rights to life and supporting human rights in the world. 
The work of the Commission focuses on implementing a human-rights–based approach at the heart of policy choices and practice in Scotland to ensure that human rights are at the centre of how organisations in Scotland work, as well as how they measure success.
During the course of its previous Strategic Plan the Commission undertook research to map gaps and good practices in the realisation of human rights in Scotland. The Commission published this research in 2012 in a document called 'Getting it Right' [http://www.scottishhumanrights.com/actionplan/executivesummary]. The results of this mapping research is the basis for SNAP. SNAP is currently being developed through participation with civil society and other relevant stakeholders and it is planned to be launched in December 2013. 
This project aims to increase awareness, understanding and confidence in the care sector about human rights in order to improve conditions for those in care and for their carers. Particular emphasis has been placed on the needs of older people through a training package called "Care about Rights.
In February 2010 the Commission published a comprehensive human rights framework to address historic child abuse through an Acknowledgement and Accountability Forum.. The framework was positively received by many survivors and international experts. The Commission continues to monitor the process of acknowledgement and accountability in Scotland and the implementation of its recommendations. The Commission is currently working with the Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland to deliver a series of InterActions with to develop an Action Plan on Justice and Remedies. You can read more about the InterActions here: [www.shrcinteraction.org]
In May 2009 the Commission undertook a major evaluation of the experience of a Special NHS Health Board which had sought to adopt a human-rights–based approach into their policies and organisational culture. The evaluation identified clear evidence of the success of the human rights based approach and several public authorities have expressed an interest.
In order to fulfil its mandate concerning education and training the Commission has developed training materials on human rights for staff in local authorities. In January 2010 the Commission piloted human rights training for staff within the Services for Communities Division of the City of Edinburgh Council. In the following month research was also conducted into international best practice and various experiences of carrying out human rights impact assessments. In 2013 the Commission is piloting a joint Equalities and Human Rights Impact Assessment with two partner organisations, Fife and Renfrewshire Councils. The project will begin by establishing an understanding of current practices and approaches to assessing equality and human rights impacts, and develop appropriate means for the partner organisations to move beyond the legal requirement to carry out equality impact assessment towards having the capability to assess equality and human rights impacts together. The pilot bodies will contribute to the development of ideas and also to the road-testing of such approaches. [http://www.scottishhumanrights.com/ourresources/hreqiamaincontent]
Emerging human rights issues.
In 2010 the Commission contributed to the work of the Working Group of the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions on Business and Human Rights by drafting a survey for all institutions on their interests, needs and capacities in the area. The Commission also provided written and oral evidence to the UK Parliament Joint Committee on Human Rights inquiry on Business and Human Rights. In October 2010 the Commission hosted the International Conference of National Human Rights Institutions on the theme of Business and Human Rights. The conference agreed the Edinburgh Declaration, which sets an action plan for NHRIs on business and human rights. 
In 2009, the Conservative party, then the main UK opposition party, announced that, if elected, it would repeal the Human Rights Act 1998 and replace it with a Bill of Rights. In March 2010 the Commission published two statements, including one co-signed with the NIHRC, calling for the preservation of the Act and emphasising that human rights would be best protected by building on the Act instead of replacing it. 
In November 2009 the Commission, in conjunction with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Scottish Government and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, held a conference in Glasgow on 'Human Rights and Climate Change, Achieving climate justice in Scotland'.
International activities.
The Commission is one of over 80 NHRIs within the ICC's global network supported by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In June 2010 the Commission was given "A status" accreditation by the ICC; this gives it enhanced access to treaty bodies and other UN mechanisms. Along with the NIHRC and EHRC the SHRC participates in the European Group of NHRIs. The SHRC is currently the Chair of the European Group.
In June 2009 the Commission hosted the first joint meeting of the four national human rights institutions of the UK and Ireland; the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Irish Human Rights Commission, the NIHRC and, of course, the Scottish Commission. Justice Albie Sachs, a former justice of the South African Constitutional Court, also participated in the meeting. 
In October 2010 the Commission hosted the 10th International Conference of National Human Rights Institutions at the Scottish Parliament, bringing together delegates from over 80 countries to discuss issues around Business and Human Rights. The conference ended with the agreement of the Edinburgh Declaration.
The Commission frequently makes submissions to the Treaty bodies of the United Nations framework. The reports provide a critique of law, policy and practice in Scotland.
In June 2009 the Commission was appointed a member of the UK's independent mechanism responsible for promoting, monitoring and protecting the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Supreme Commander 2

Supreme Commander 2 is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game developed by Gas Powered Games and published by Square Enix. It is a sequel to "Supreme Commander". A PC-only demo was initially released via Steam on 24 February 2010, with the full game released on 2 March 2010.
A Mac OS X version of "Supreme Commander 2" was announced by Mac games publisher Virtual Programming in May 2010. They released the Mac OS X version of the game on 24 September 2010 and released the Infinite War Battle Pack for Mac OS X in January 2011.
Plot.
The story starts with the newly elected President's assassination, causing the breakup of the coalition formed during the expansion of the first game.
The first campaign (dedicated to the UEF or United Earth Federation) follows Dominic Maddox, a UEF officer who is married to an Illuminate. Maddox fights off Cybran until the UEF Commander he serves declared that all Illuminate are terrorists and orders him on a mission to "round up" the Illuminate from his home city. Maddox refuses, goes rogue, and decides to go on his own campaign to remove his old commanding officer from power. Immediately following the defeat of the UEF Commander, he discovers a portal that leads to Seraphim VII, unlocking the second campaign.
The second campaign (dedicated to the Illuminate) follows Commander Thalia Kael as she fights to restore the Illuminate to their former glory before turning against her former comrades and realizing her mistake.
The Cybran campaign follows Ivan Brackman (an experimental "genetic composite" clone of Dr. Brackman and Elite Commander Dostya), an old roommate of Maddox, who fights under the direction of Dr. Brackman (whom Ivan refers to as "father" while attempting to help his friends).
The final battle takes place on the surface of an ancient planetary terraformer called Shiva Prime. After the battle, Ivan comes to a realisation about Shiva Prime and does not conform to his father's will.
Demo.
On 24 February 2010, a demo of "Supreme Commander 2" was released on the Steam digital distribution service. The demo includes two tutorial levels and two campaign levels all played as the UEF faction, but does not include skirmish or multiplayer modes. The single player includes two missions, which were picked to show the more advanced portion of the game.
Gameplay.
In both the skirmish and multiplayer modes, players start out with an Armored Command Unit (ACU) which is a large, powerful, construction-capable unit, as their avatar on the battlefield. They build mass extractors and power generators which produce mass and energy, along with a research facilities, which produce research points faster. Players can also build land, air and sea factories which produce land, air and sea units respectively. Players may also build add-on structures, expanding the capabilities of existing factories. Some buildings and units are more advanced than others, and as players' base and research levels expand, so does the quality of their units. Research points can be spent on faction-specific tech trees to add bonuses, abilities and upgrades, and to unlock more-advanced units and buildings. The final result of this development is the unlocking of experimental units, which are large, research-unlocked units and buildings with significantly more power than other units and buildings. Experimental units can be produced from experimental gantries (buildings with the sole purpose of building experimental units) or built by engineers. The ultimate aim of the game is to destroy the opponents' ACUs.
In the heavily-scripted campaign mode, the player is provided with a base at the start of the game, and faces an already-established opponent. In order to finish the level, the player has to complete certain objectives, for example "destroy the enemy's experimental unit". As the campaign progresses, the player is able to unlock a wider range of units, the missions become more challenging, and the enemy grows stronger.
In an interview with MacGamer, an online magazine dedicated to gaming on Mac PCs, game designer Chris Taylor had this to say about "Supreme Commander 2" and its spiritual link to his previous Total Annihilation series: "I think they are indeed the spiritual successors, because of the way I approach RTS Real-time strategy design. I don’t like a lot of rules, and I like big, open worlds. Some might say the economy systems play a role in that, but I think it goes much deeper than that. I think many folks will see our upcoming Kings and Castles game as a continuing extension of those previous RTS titles." 
Changes from "Supreme Commander".
While there are many differences between "Supreme Commander" (together with its expansion, "Forged Alliance") and "Supreme Commander 2", the two primary changes are the introduction of a new resource – research – and a complete reworking of the resource-gathering mechanism.
Research.
Research is a new form of resource which is accumulated by building research labs. The rate at which research is acquired is based on the number of research labs built. Research points can be spent to acquire new technology in a hierarchical fashion at any time during the game. This produces an entirely different game from the original because it often results in a multiplayer game where one side will suddenly acquire a significant technological advantage (for example the ability to use a loyalty gun, which converts lots of enemy units to one's own side, or the ability to fire a nuclear missile). It is often this sudden, game-changing acquisition of technological advantage which leads to the end of a multiplayer or skirmish game.
Resource Gathering.
The primary resources in "Supreme Commander 2" are still mass and energy. However, the way these resources are accumulated and used by the player has been drastically changed from the first game in the series. The Xbox 360 version is considered "broken" by many players due to an economic glitch involving two engineers and an unfinished structure.
In the game's first release, the resource-system functioned as it does in most other RTS games (resources can only be spent after being acquired, and build orders cannot be placed if there are insufficient resources to complete the build - starting a build reduced a player's resources by the total cost of the build immediately). However, patch 1.23 significantly changed the economy system. Resources are deducted from the total during the build. If there are insufficient resources to complete the build then engineers and factories will build as far as current resources allow and then remain in a quasi-paused state until more resources become available. With this change, the building mechanic more closely resembles that of the previous game.
Mass fabricators (which in "Supreme Commander" changed energy into mass at a pre-determined rate) have been replaced with mass converters, which must be manually triggered to change a fixed amount of energy into a corresponding amount of mass.
Reception.
On initial release, the game received mixed critical reception. While many critics praised the game as a standalone title, it was generally perceived to be a simplified version of the original game. Alec Meer, reviewing for Eurogamer, predicted that the game would "leave much of its intended fanbase cold," and Tom Francis, writing for PC Gamer UK, later summarized "Supreme Commander 2" as "a game that solved the accessibility issues of the first game, bought primarily by people who didn’t want them solved." On Metacritic, which aggregates a wide range of reviews and assigns an average score, the game received 77 out of 100.
After release, the game received several major updates and changes. For example, one update released in October 2010 reworked the way construction was paid for, as described above. The changes were widely praised and the game was considered by critics to have been improved since release. For example, Tom Francis, who gave the game a score of 85 out of 100 on release, said in October 2010 that had he been reviewing it in October 2010, he would have given it a 90. PC Gamer UK named "Supreme Commander 2" their 2010 "Co-op Game Of The Year".

Bushnak

Bushnak (, meaning "Bosnian" or "Bosniak", also transliterated Bushnaq and Boshnak) is a surname common among Palestinians who are of Bosnian origin. Those sharing this surname are the descendants of Bosnian Muslims apprehensive of living under Christian rule after the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, who emigrated to Palestine within the Ottoman empire.
While not originally from one family, most Bosnians who emigrated to Palestine adopted Bushnak as a common surname, attesting to their origins.
History.
Some Bosnian movement to Palestine occurred when Bosnian Muslim soldiers were brought to Palestine in the late 1800s to provide reinforcements for the Ottoman army. 
More substantial movement occurred after 1878, when the Austro-Hungarian empire, ruled by the , occupied Bosnia. Bosnian Muslim emigration continued through this period, escalating after the Austro-Hungarian's 1908 annexation of Bosnia. Many emigrated to parts of what is now modern Turkey, while a smaller number settled in Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan.
In Palestine, these Bosnian emigrants settled predominantly in villages in the northern parts of the present day West Bank and Israel: Caesarea (Qisarya), Yanun, Nablus, and Tulkarem. Their descendants still live in these villages, their Bosnian heritage reflected in the Arab surname of Bushnak.
The Bosnian Muslim immigrants who settled in Caesarea in 1878 built two mosques, joining other Muslim immigrants from Morocco, Algeria, Crimea, the Caucasus, and Turkestan. These Slavic speaking immigrants eventually assimilated into the Arab population of Palestine.
One of the most historically prominent Bosnian-Palestinians was Jezzar Pasha, who was the Ottoman ruler of Acre and the Galilee from 1775 until his death.
Other uses.
Bushnak is also used colloquially among Palestinians to refer to someone who is fair-skinned and good looking.

Hieronimo Squarciafico

Hieronimo Squarciafico was a 15th-century Venetian editor, who worked for the Italian humanist and printer Aldus Manutius, the founder of the Aldine Press at Venice. Squarciafico is best known for bemoaning the printing press in an aphorism that reads as a pithy summation of his contemporaries' concerns over the spread of printed works: "Abundance of books makes men less studious". Initially, in 1477, he wrote enthusiastically about the works he was engaged in having printed. Yet, a few years later, in 1481, Squarciafico appeared to hold a more skeptical view when he imagined a discussion between the spirits of the great authors of the past being held in the Elysian Fields in which some of them lauded the craft of printing; while others complained that "printing had fallen into the hands of unlettered men, who corrupted almost everything"; and yet still others lamented that "their works would perish if they were not printed, since this art compels all writers to give way to it".
Squarciafico remains relevant today in criticisms of modern electronic culture; he has, in recent times, been quoted by theologian Walter J. Ong and technology critic Nicholas G. Carr, among others.

Hayden Chisholm

Hayden Chisholm (born 27 May 1975 in Otahuhu, New Zealand) is a New Zealand saxophonist, composer, and multi-instrumentalist. His work has touched on a wide range of musical genres but he is best known for his jazz, improvised and contemporary classical music, his work with the artist Rebecca Horn and his micro-tonal saxophone technique developed in 1995.
Life and career.
Chisholm was raised in New Plymouth, New Zealand, by parents Heather and Doug Chisholm. His first musical experiences came with local Dixieland bands. He began playing clarinet at age nine before switching to what became his primary instrument, the alto saxophone, two years later. The early influences of Johnny Hodges, Sun Ra, Eric Dolphy were strong, being his first jazz records. He was a member of the award winning New Plymouth Boys' High School Jazz band and won the prize for Most Outstanding Jazz Musician at the National Jazz Festival in Tauranga, 1991.
With a DAAD scholarship Chisholm attended the Musik Hochschule in Cologne, Germany. He studied saxophone with Frank Gratkowski. In 1997 he received the New Zealand Young Achievers Award which enabled him to continue his studies abroad. During these years he also studied Carnatic music in Chennai and traveled extensively in the Balkans learning the different musical traditions.
During his studies in Cologne Chisholm developed a system of micro-tonal fingerings for saxophone and so called "split-scales" which he presented on his 1996 debut solo CD "Circe" on Jazzhaus Musik. These scales split perfect intervals using quarter tones. His microtonal work was later featured on the Root70 album "Root70 on 52nd 1/4 Street" which received the German Critics Award.
During his studies in Cologne he met many musicians he still collaborates with today including Marcus Schmickler, Nils Wogram, John Taylor, Felix Fan, Adrian Brendel, Burnt Friedman, Jochen Rückert, Burnt Friedman, Antonis Anissegos, Jaki Liebezeit, Claudio Bohorquez. He also worked under Mauricio Kagel who was then professor for composition.
Since 2000 he has collaborated with the German artist Rebecca Horn. His work with her is wide ranging, from composing the music for major site-specific installations “Moonmirror” (Mallorca, 2003), “Lumiere en Prison” (Paris, 2002), Spiriti de Madre Perla” (Naples, 2002), “Twilight Transit” (NYC 2004), Heart Shadows (Lisbon, 2005), "Das Universum in einer Perle” (Berlin, 2006), to recomposing the music for her early performance films which was released on a complete DVD set in 2005. In 2008 he worked as assistant director with Horn for the Salvatore Sciarrino Opera "Luci mie traditrici" at the Salzburger Festspiele. In 2009 he composed the music for her film "Fata Morgana" which was premiered at the Teatro La Fenice Opera House during the Venice Biannale. In 2011 he composed the music for her documentary film "Moonmirror Journey" which premiered in Berlin.
In 2001 he composed music for the German Theater (Deutsches Schauspielhaus) in Hamburg, working on Maria Stuart by Schiller and Arabische Nacht by Schimmelpfennig.
In 2006 and 2007 he was musical director of the Earth Festival in Kenya which featured a large cast of international musicians, including Huun Huur Tu. In 2008 he performed with David Sylvian on the "World is Everything" tour.
Since 2006 he teaches a yearly masterclass on Mount Pilion in Greece in the village of Agios Lavrentios. His course "The G-string of Pythagoras"fuses saxophone, just intonation, ancient music theory, and improvisation.
In 2012 Chisholm was featured in the feature documentary Sound of Heimat – Deutschland singt, directed by Arne Birkenstock and Jan Tengeler. In the film, Chisholm travels through Germany and explores authentic forms of German folk music.
In 2013 he released a 13 CD Box set "!3 Views of the Heart's Cargo" which presents his most important recordings dating back to 2001. The first CD in this box, "Love in Numbers", features works for Saxophone in which Chisholm explores the Fibonacci series as it manifests in the overtone series.
He is a member of the quartet Root 70 with trombonist Nils Wogram.

WMLK

WMLK (9265 kHz) is a radio station in Bethel, Pennsylvania owned by the Assemblies of Yahweh. WMLK takes its name from MLK, representing three of the four consonants of the Hebrew word "malakh" (מַלְאָךְ) meaning a “messenger” or angel.
History.
In 1981, the Assemblies of Yahweh bought a 50,000 watt radio transmitter which was converted into a tool for shortwave broadcasting. From this point onwards, the Assemblies of Yahweh began to build their own radio station in order to “proclaim Yahweh’s Truth.” Two prominent members of the Assemblies of Yahweh were hired to work on this project, both in the dismantling and rebuilding of WMLK. The transmitter in its early stages required reconditioning and conversion, whilst the building which housed it needed repairing. It is believed that this project is rapidly approaching completion, with visitors periodically coming to see the WMLK enterprise. Because the Assemblies of Yahweh remains a somewhat small organization in comparison to most Christian denominations, WMLK has been heralded as a success and a grand accomplishment by members and non-members of the Assemblies of Yahweh [http://wmlkradio.net/brochure.pdf] and Meyer had hoped to see the WMLK radio station upgraded to 200,000 watts before long:
WMLK also streams online through the TuneIn website.
Trumpet sound.
The plans for WMLKs large antenna revealed the shape of a trumpet or "shofar"' (). These steel posts (once sign posts), hoist the WMLK antennas skyward, standing over a busy Interstate Route 78. The Assemblies of Yahweh believe that this is a fulfilment of the prophecy found in Jeremiah 31:21. According to Assemblies of Yahweh reports, WMLK has required much sacrificial dedication from the leadership, and is often referred to as the “Messenger of Truth”. In 1985 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license was granted, and further, permission endorsed to increase the power of the WMLK radio station.
Sermons.
The station is used extensively. Sermon and Bible studies are aired across the globe, proclaiming the message of Yahweh: repentance and obedience to the Biblical Law (). According to the SNB magazine (6/1988), the key targeted areas were Europe and the Middle East [http://www.wmlkradio.net/times.html], but the signal waves are not limited and reach far and wide. At present, audiences from 120 countries have responded.
WMLK is an expensive project, but the Assemblies of Yahweh resolutely believe in witnessing this “truth” of the Bible to the nations. WMLK has stimulated much global response and has also been the theme of numerous newspaper articles. The Assemblies of Yahweh encourage all members with access to regularly listen to the sermons, which are occasionally described as: “the voice crying in the wilderness” ().

We are Seven

"We are Seven" is a poem written by William Wordsworth and published in his "Lyrical Ballads". It describes a discussion between an adult poetic speaker and a "little cottage girl" about the number of brothers and sisters who dwell with her. The poem turns on the question of whether to count two dead siblings as part of the family.
Background.
Wordsworth claimed that the idea for "We are Seven" came to him while travelling alone across England in October 1793 after becoming separated from his friend, William Calvert. This solitude with nature he claimed encouraged him to reach a deeper understanding where the experience was no longer just for pleasure, as it was in his earlier days, but also hinted at a darker side. Immersed in these feelings, Wordsworth came to Goodrich Castle and met a little girl who would serve as the model for the little girl in "We are Seven". Although there is no documentation on what the little girl actually told him during their conversation, she interested Wordsworth to such an extent that he wrote: 
I have only to add that in the spring of 1841 I revisited Goodrich Castle, not having seen that part of the Wye since I met the little Girl there in 1793. It would have given me greater pleasure to have found in the neighbouring hamlet traces of one who had interested me so much; but it was impossible, as unfortunately I did not even know her name.
Wordsworth began to write the poem in early 1798 while working on many other poems modelled on the ballad form for a joint poetry collection with Samuel Coleridge. The collection was proposed in March because Wordsworth needed to raise money for a proposed journey to Germany with Coleridge. These poems were included in "Lyrical Ballads and A Few Other Poems" with a few written by Coleridge. Wordsworth describes the moment of finishing the poem:
My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last line. When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my Sister, and said, 'A prefatory stanza must be added, and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task were finished.' I mentioned in substance what I wished to be expressed, and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus:-
I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jem,' as being ludicrous, but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching-in our friend, James T —'s name, who was familiarly called Jem. He was brother of the dramatist, and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice. The said Jem got a sight of the Lyrical Ballads as it was going through the press at Bristol, during which time I was residing in that city. One evening he came to me with a grave face, and said, 'Wordsworth, I have seen the volume that Coleridge and you are about to publish. There is one poem in it which I earnestly entrate you will cancel, for, if published, it will make you ever lastingly ridiculous.' I answered that I felt much obliged by the interest he took in my good name as a writer, and begged to know what was the unfortunate piece he alluded to. He said, 'It is called "We are seven."' Nay! said I, that shall take its chance, however, and he left me in despair.
The collection, including "We are Seven", was accepted by Joseph Cottle in May 1798 and was soon after published anonymously. In 1820, the poem was republished as a broadside and titled "The Little Maid and the Gentleman".
Many guidebooks and locals in the city of Conwy, Wales claim Wordsworth was inspired to write the poem after seeing a gravestone in St Mary and All Saints Church. The gravestone is marked "We are Seven."
The poem.
The poem is a dialogue between a narrator who serves as a questioner and a little girl, with part of the evolving first stanza contributed by Coleridge. The poem is written in ballad form.
The poem begins with the narrator asking:
He transitions to describe a girl whose beauty pleased him: 
He begins to question her about her siblings: 
He questions her further, asking where they are, and she simply responds that two are in Wales, two are at sea, and two are buried in a churchyard near her home. He is confused by her answer and asks:
She replies:
He questions her further, trying to have her admit that there are only five but she responds: 
She then describes how they die, which prompts the narrator to ask:
After the little girl repeats that they were seven in number, the narrator, frustrated, replies: 
The poem ends with a divide between the child and the narrator: 
Interpretation and Critical Response.
In his Preface to "Lyrical Ballads", Wordsworth wrote that the poems exhibit a "power of real and substantial action and suffering" and, in particular to "We are Seven", to express "the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood attend our notion of death, or rather our utter inability to admit that notion". Geoffrey Hartman points out that there is a subconscious cleaving to an idea to escape from a feeling of separation. The little girl in the poem is unable to realise that she is separated from her dead siblings. She is unable to understand death, and she is forever in an imaginative state of being, and nature is interfering to keep the girl from understanding her separation from her siblings. Susan J. Wolfson emphasised the reducing tone of the questioner, which allows the girl to articulate a more Romantic view of presence.
More recent scholarship, however, focuses on the sociological context for the poem, written the same year that Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population was published. Frances Ferguson argues that the poem stages a debate about personification in language. Hollis Robbins argues that the questions asked of the little girl follow the census polling forms proposed by John Rickman in his 1796 census proposal to Parliament. Like Oliver Goldsmith's "The Deserted Village," Robbins argues, Wordsworth's "We Are Seven" "promotes a traditional link between individuals and the place they were born." Peter DeBolla argues that the poem is irresolvable partly because of the math in the poem—the evenhanded tension between even and odd. Maureen McLane reads the poem in the context of moral philosophy and argues that while the girl and the questioner speak the same language, they have wholly different views about time, death, and counting. John Mahoney argues, "The seemingly silly squabble between adult and child is already a revelation of the early and continuing tension in the poet between the hope for a perpetual bliss and the incursion of a harsh reality."
The poem was set to music by Mohammed Fairouz.

Ottokar Fischer

Ottokar Fischer Marteau was an Austrian magician.
History.
Ottokar Fischer Marteau, "also known as (born)" Ottokar Fischer (November 10, 1873, Leschan () - December 1, 1940) was born in a small village Leschan in Austrian Empire. In 1883 his parents moved to Vienna, where he saw Charles Obra, Mellini, Ben Ali Bey, and other noted performers. He gave his own first public performance at age 18. He billed himself as ""O.F. Marteau"".
In 1896 Fischer met George Heubeck, who was the successor of Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser, who taught him all of Hofzinser's effects. Fischer also previously had studied with A. Fredmar the only pupil of Compars Herrmann.
Fischer confessed that he did not find a lot of personal information about Hofzinser. He based his knowledge mainly on delivered stories and information by Hofzinser's friends and pupils and on detected letters and manuscripts as well as on several magic props of Hofzinser which he got from his friends.
Starting in 1898 he managed and appeared regularly at the Kratky Baschik theatre in Vienna, a magic theatre with nearly 1000 seats. For 12 years he performed daily with a two and a half-hour show of magic. Several times Fischer performed before the Imperial Court of Austria and before other crowned heads.
He performed for many years as a magician, before retiring after World War I to write a history of the art of magic.
Fischer was the founder of the "Wiener Magischer Klub" and its president for many years.
April 1936, was on cover of International Brotherhood of Magicians magazine 'The Linking Ring'.
In 1939 the Society of American Magicians made Fischer an honorary member.

Kathy J. Byron (born September 5, 1953) is an American politician. Since 1998 she has been a Republican member of the Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 22nd district in the Virginia Piedmont, consisting of parts of Bedford, Campbell and Franklin Counties and the city of Lynchburg.
House of Delegates.
In February 2012, she sponsored HB462, a bill that would require that Virginia women seeking an abortion would have to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound, without her written consent and even if it is against the wishes of her doctor.
After the controversy caused by passing of this bill by Virginia representatives, Governor Bob McDonnell amended the bill to include language that would require the written consent of the woman seeking an abortion, and would also require only a transabdominal ultrasound. However, Rep. Kathy Byron urged rejection of the amendment on its grounds that a transvaginal ultrasound is an invasive procedure because, “If we want to talk about invasiveness, there's nothing more invasive than the procedure that she is about to have," she said, referring to her belief that abortions harm viable persons within the womb.

Cartoning machine

A cartoning machine or cartoner, is a packaging machine that forms cartons: erect, close, folded, side seamed and sealed cartons.
Packaging machines which form a carton board blank into a carton filled with a product or bag of products or number of products say into single carton, after the filling, the machine engages its tabs / slots to apply adhesive and close both the ends of carton completely sealing the carton.
Cartoning machines can be divided into two types:
A cartoning machine which picks a single piece from stack of folded carton and erects it, fills with a product or bag of products or number of products horizontally through an open end and closes by tucking the end flaps of the carton or applying glue or adhesive. The product might be pushed in the carton either through the mechanical sleeve or by pressurized air. For many applications however, the products are inserted into the carton manually. This type of Cartoning machine is widely used for packaging foodstuffs, confectionery, medicine, cosmetics, sundry goods, etc.
A cartoning machine which erects a folded carton, fills with a product or number of products vertically through an open end and closes by either tucking the end flaps of the carton or applying glue or adhesive, is called a top end cartoning machine. Widely used for packaging bottled foodstuffs, confectionery, medicine, cosmetics, etc.

The Orange Girl

The Orange Girl ("Appelsinpiken") is a Norwegian movie released in February 2009. It is based on a book by author Jostein Gaarder; a book translated to 43 languages. In addition to the Norwegian production company Sandrew Metronome, the German company Tradewind Pictures and the Spanish Jaleo Films are also part of the project.
Plot.
The film is based on a 2003 novel by the same name, written by Norwegian author Jostein Gaarder. The main character is the young boy Georg who one day finds a long letter from his deceased father in his old red stroller. The letter tells, among other things, about the father's youthful love for the mysterious "orange girl" ("appelsinpiken"), and leaves a mystery for Georg to solve. The story leaps back and forth between the father's letters to the future, the young boy's thoughts and the events of the father's life.
Reception.
The newspaper "Verdens Gang" gave the movie four out of six points. The reviewer, Jon Selås, found the movie had succeeded in tying together several different story lines in a convincing manner. At the same time he did not think the flow of the dialogue was entirely natural. Among the actors he was most impressed by Annie Dahr Nygaard's effort.

The EN 54 Fire detection and fire alarm systems is a mandatory standard that specifies requirements and laboratory test for every component of fire detection and fire alarm system and it allows the free movement of construction products between countries of the European Union market.
It was developed and approved by European Committee for Standardization (CEN, French: Comité Européen de Normalisation).
This standard is widely recognized around the world for several countries outside of European Union. It is recognized in Latin American countries, Brasil, African and Asian countries and several islands in the Pacific Ocean.
Mandatory Standard in the European Countries.
According to the Construction Product Directive 89/106/CE, it is mandatory that Fire Detection and Fire Alarm equipments are certified under EN 54 Standard by an authorized Certification Body.
This is the only way to affix the CE mark on the product, which recognizes that this product fulfils all the European Union safety and performances requirements and allows free movement inside all European Union market.
Therefore, CE mark is the only legal condition for trade. Any other mark is voluntary and can not substituted the CE mark. This means that others marks must be based on EN 54 Standards having very restricted actuation field implementing minor requirements.
The Construction Products Regulation (CPR) has been adopted by the European Commission and replaces the Construction Products Directive (CPD). As a result of the change, CE mark will soon become mandatory in the European Union. Manufacturers and importers have until July 2013 to ensure that their construction products meet the CE requirements of the new Regulation.
It is to ensure the free movement of all construction products within the European Union by harmonizing national laws with respect to the essential requirements applicable to construction products in terms of health and safety. 
The main goal is to ensure that construction products are only introduced to the European market if they are fit for their intended use.

James Feast

William James "Jim" Feast CBE FRS FRSC (born 25 June 1938) is a British chemical scientist and academic.
Early life.
Feast was born in Birmingham to a school teacher and housewife, and was educated at the King Edward VI School in Lichfield, studying humanities but being redirected to scientific studies due to his 'inclination to sit and dream', which led to him calling himself an 'accidental chemist'. He initially planned to study mathematics at university, but changed his mind after an interview with Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham, and enrolled at the University of Sheffield to study chemistry, graduating with a Bsc in 1960. After graduation he began to study for a PhD at the University of Birmingham in organo-fluorine chemistry, which he completed in 1963, staying until 1965 for the purpose of post-doctoral research. In 1965 he became a lecturer at Durham University, specifically Van Mildert College, where he stayed for over 35 years until his 2003 retirement. In 1967 he married his first wife Jenneke, with whom he has two daughters, Saskia and Marieke.
Research and academic work.
Despite his PhD in organo-fluorine chemistry he switched focus by 1970 to look more at polymer chemistry, specifically polymer synthesis after he had experimented with fluorinated diene monomers and 'found it fascinating that you could take a mobile, colourless fluid and produce a material that had potentially interesting properties.' He helped develop what is now known as the "Durham precursor route" to manufacturing polyacetylene, and during the 70s and 80s the polymer synthesis knowledge of Feast and his group led to invitations to work as a guest lecturer, and eventually he spent two months a year teaching at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz. During his time at Durham Feast was promoted up the academic ranks, rising from lecturer to senior lecturer in 1965 and professor in 1986. In 1996 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 2006 was elected President for two years of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Other than his appointment at Durham he also held various guest and visiting lecturer positions, including at the University of Leuven between 1985 and 1988, Cornell University in 1993 and the California Institute of Technology in 1999.
Retirement.
He retired in 2003, but continues to work at Durham University as a Research Professor, and also at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In 2004 he was awarded an honorary DSc from the University of Warwick. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for "services to polymer chemistry" in the 2007 New Year Honours. Later that year he was awarded a Royal Medal for "his outstanding contributions to chemical synthesis with far reaching implications, particularly for the field of functional polymeric materials."

A Hfq binding sRNA is an sRNA that binds the bacterial RNA binding protein called Hfq. A number of bacterial small RNAs which have been shown to bind to Hfq have been characterised (see list).
Many of these RNAs share a similar structure composed of three stem-loops. Recent studies have expanded this list and experimentally validated a total of 64 Hfq binding sRNA in "Salmonella Typhimurium". Genomic SELEX has been used to show that Hfq binding RNAs are enriched in the sequence motif 5'-AAYAAYAA-3'.

Luigi Amoroso

Luigi Amoroso (March 26, 1886 – October 28, 1965) was an Italian neoclassical economist influenced by Vilfredo Pareto. He provided support for and influenced the economic policy during the fascist regime. The microeconomical concept of the Amoroso–Robinson relation is named after him (and Joan Robinson): according to paper he is one of the first economists to study the dynamical equilibrium theory, using an analogy between economic systems and classical mechanics and thus applying to theories of economical behaviour mathematical tools as the calculus of variation. In his young years he contributed to the theory of functions of several complex variables, giving for the first time a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for holomorphic functions of several variables in the paper . Also, in 1927 he provided to his former "Normale" schoolfellow Mauro Picone the funding for the creation of the "Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo", now called "Istituto per le Applicazioni del Calcolo "Mauro Picone"" by means of a local bank.

Psilocybe stuntzii

Psilocybe stuntzii, also known as Stuntz's Blue legs and Blue Ringers it is a psilocybin mushroom of the Strophariaceae family, having psilocybin and 
psilocin as main active compounds.
It is in the section Stuntzae, other members of the section include "Psilocybe caeruleoannulata", "Psilocybe meridionalis", "Psilocybe mescaleroensis", "Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata", "Psilocybe rostrata", "Psilocybe subaeruginascens", "Psilocybe subaeruginascens" var. "septentrionbalis" and "Psilocybe uruguayensis".
Etymology and history.
The mushroom is named in honor of mycologist Daniel Stuntz of the University of Washington. It was originally identified growing on the University of Washington campus. Also known as "Psilocybe pugetensis".
Habitat and distribution.
"Psilocybe stuntzii" is found growing scattered to gregarious to cespitose, rarely solitary, in conifer wood chips and bark mulch, in soils rich in woody debris, and in new lawns of freshly laid sod or any newly mulched garden throughout the western region of the Pacific Northwest. From late July through December, 
has been observed growing all year long in the Seattle, Washington area, also reported from California, rarely as far south as Santa Cruz.
There was a time when this mushroom appeared in over 40 percent of all new lawns and mulched in areas in the Puget Sound region of the Pacific Northwest. Due to a disappearance of pastures south of Seattle in the Tukwila-Kent-Auburn areas, this mushroom now only appears sporadically in certain new lawns which are well fertilized and manicured.
Edibility.
This mushroom is hallucinogenic and is therefore considered inedible. Additionally, it closely resembles the highly toxic "Galerina marginata", and several poisonings have been attributed to collectors consuming "G. marginata" after mistaking them for hallucinogenic "P. stuntzii".

Prussian T 37

The Prussian T 37's were German steam locomotives operated by the Prussian state railways. They replaced the smaller 0-6-0T locomotives on the railway line between Beuthen and Kattowitz. In all 18 engines were supplied to Prussia, of which eight were taken over by the Reichsbahn and given numbers 99 401 to 99 408. They were all withdrawn by 1939 and scrapped.
These locomotives were equipped with Klien-Lindner axles at each end. They had an outside frame and the third wheelset was driven. They also had an outside Walschaerts valve gear. The engines could carry 1.3 tonnes of coal and 2.5 m² of water. The coal tank was located behind the driver's cab.

<doc id="20183067" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20183067" title="NIGP Code">
NIGP Code

The NIGP Commodity/Services Code is an acronym for the National Institute of Governmental Purchasings Commodity Services Code. The NIGP Code is a coding taxonomy used primarily to classify products and services procured by state and local governments in the United States. 
The classification system was developed in the mid 1980s as a result of efforts by public procurement officials in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Illinois and other states, cities and counties to provide a mechanism to classify the products and services that used in public procurement. Led by Homer Forrestor, the Director of General Services in Texas, the group produced the initial codeset in 1983. 
The copyright for the data file was transferred to the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing (NIGP)and the NIGP Code was born. The NIGP Code is now the standard taxonomy for classifying vendors and spend data for 33 states and thousands of local entities within North America.
NIGP appointed Periscope Holdings, Inc., as the custodian of the NIGP Code in 2001. The firm is responsible for licensing, overseeing code change requests, publication of version releases, communication with end users, phone support, training, integrity of the codeset, and commodity coding services for the conversion of contract and inventory files.
The NIGP Code is most commonly used to classify vendors and to track spend data for use in strategic sourcing and spending analysis. The database is often incorporated into the procurement software utilized by the entity for use in e-procurement. The NIGP Code currently exists in English and Spanish versions. Cross references have been created for the NAICS, UNSPSC and MCC codesets. Version 21 is the current release.
NIGP Code structure.
The NIGP Code is structured as follows: 
3-Digit Class Code
The 3-Digit class Code has a brief general description. This level contains 212 Commodity (Product) Classes and 55 Service Classes totaling 267 Classes. The 3-Digit Code is primarily used to generate periodic expenditure history by department for fiscal planning, budget execution, and accounting.
5-Digit Class-Item Code
The 5-Digit class-item Code is an expanded version of the 3-Digit class Code. Currently, it contains over 8,200 descriptions. This level categorizes vendors by class-item to allow your procurement software to automate bidder selection, produce no-bid response reports, vendor performance reports, and minority business and HUB reports by Code. Purchase history can be captured at this level as well.
7-Digit Class-Item-Group Code
The 7-Digit Code provides an additional level of purchase description. It contains over 36,000 descriptions. It can be used to develop a specification file and is used with the 11-Digit Code to create a comprehensive purchase description.
11-Digit Class-Item-Group-Detail Code
The 11-Digit Code is generally used to create, manage, and maintain line-item term contracts. It is also used to identify stock items in inventory. This level of the Code currently contains over 485,000 descriptions which provides a great amount of flexibility when creating contracts and tracking inventory.
NIGP Code access.
The NIGP Code can be accessed in several ways. The most common is via the NIGP Code web search tool, the NIGP Living Code, which hosts a search engine for the Code for end users. The site also has a download section, which provides for end user download of the entire codeset or modifications to the codeset since the last download by the user. The download file can be formatted as an Excel, tab-delimited or csv file. In addition, the Code is available via printed format in the Alphabetical Index Book and the Class Item Index.
NB: the link is dead.
NIGP Code maintenance.
Maintenance and additions/clarifications to the Code come from three primary sources: codes generated by direct customer requests, codes identified as part of coding services, and codes identified from seated working groups. Additions/clarifications at the 3 and 5 digit level are typically processed within 24 hours. Code requests targeted at the 7 and 11 digit levels typically are processed within 2–3 days, although codes can be generated within 24 hours under certain circumstances.
Updates to the Code are published weekly to the nigp.com site for download by users. Codes requested directly from users are typically delivered via extract files to the user, with general release of the new codes in the weekly website update.
Environmentally certified codes.
The current working group for the NIGP Code is for "green" commodity/services codes. The need for these type codes was identified in the 2nd quarter of 2008 and the working group was seated in June. The approach for environmentally certified products and services was researched and a final survey of users was executed in October 2008. Rollout began in January 2009. 
The result of this effort was the creation of environmentally certified classes of NIGP Codes. These classes indicate the products/services are "environmentally certified products by an agency accepted certification entity." This provides the end user with the flexibility to define the acceptable certification entity as per their procurement terms and conditions and provides a mechanism for reporting based on the environmentally certified commodities and services. See the GoPro magazine article Planting the Seeds for a Green Code for additional information.

Mr. Roboto Project

The Mr. Roboto Project is an all ages, Do It Yourself (DIY), non-profit volunteer run cooperative venue and show space in Pittsburgh, PA. Since Fall 2011 it has been located at 
5106 Penn Avenue. The structure of The Mr. Roboto Project was modeled partially after the 924 Gilman St club in Berkeley, CA, combined with elements of the East End Food Co-op in Pittsburgh, PA.
Membership.
The cooperative runs on a membership basis, with its members responsible for the direction of the venue. There is a 5 person board of directors who deal with the day-to-day operations, elected of any member who wishes to run for a position. Meetings are held once a month, with both members and non-members encouraged to attend. The initial membership cost is $25, with a $10 per year renewal fee. The shows at the venue are booked by its members - while there is a wide variety of different musical groups and stylings being presented, most could be placed under the general banner of "punk." 
Early history.
The beginnings of what would become the Mr. Roboto Project began in 1998. At that time there were few options for all-ages, DIY punk/hardcore/indie rock shows; most of the shows at that time were done in a handful of punk houses, most notably the Peach Pitt in South Oakland. The only consistent DIY venue was the Millvale Industrial Theater (MIT), which was outside the city limits. In 1998, the scene began to grow, the idea to create a collectively run venue in the spirit of 924 Gilman or ABC-No-Rio was hatched.
In January 1999, the first organizational meeting was held at the Peach Pitt. About 15-20 people showed up. At this meeting some of the basic structure of Roboto was formed including choosing to be set up as a cooperative with a Board of Directors rather than a strict collective. The original membership structure was decided at this meeting as well.
The name "Mr. Roboto's" was chosen as a working title. Several other ideas were originally tossed out, most having some local significance, such as "The Keystone Collective." However, in the end, most of these were poorly received by the group.
Over the coming months the group began a search for a location but had very little luck until late summer. During the previous year there had been a string of shows held at the Move Studio, a dance studio located in the borough of Wilkinsburg, just outside of Pittsburgh's East End. Roboto checked out the two neighboring buildings to the Move Studio and was on the verge of signing a rent-to-own agreement for the building directly next door. At this time the owner of the Move Studio expressed concern that noise from Roboto's shows would interfere with her dance studio. She recommended that the group contact the Wilkinsburg Chamber of Commerce to learn about other properties available in the area. This led to the group meeting up with Mark Smith, the head of the local Chamber of Commerce, and checking out an empty storefront location at 722 Wood Street. 
Plans were made to begin renting the storefront in November 1999. At that time Local promoter John Fail was looking for a venue for the second incarnation of his ADD Fest (an event with approximately 10 bands all playing 10 minute sets) and it was decided to make this Roboto's opening show. The event was planned for November 12, 1999. Due to some delays, members of Roboto were unable to get access to the space until November 11. ADD Fest 2 went off without major incident the following day. The group continued to rent the Wood Street storefront until Fall 2011, when they moved to their current location.

Morley Tunnel

Morley Tunnel is a railway tunnel in West Yorkshire, England, situated between Morley railway station and Batley railway station on the Huddersfield Line. From its northern end (), it extends , passing beneath Morley town centre, to its southern end ().
History.
Work started on the tunnel in 1845, with the first stone being laid at the Batley end of the tunnel on Monday, 23 February 1846. On that day at 12 o'clock a procession arrived at the Batley end, consisting of the 69th Infantry Band followed by workmen involved with the project (each holding aloft a banner), the directors, the contractors and other interested parties. The first stone was laid by John Gott, Esq., chairman of the Leeds, Dewsbury and Manchester Railway, and he marked this occasion by addressing the crowd and handing over £50 to the workmen in the hope it would contribute to their enjoyment and the festivities of the day. The mallet and the trowel used to lay the first stone were engraved with the coat of arms of Mr. Gott, with the following inscription:
Presented by the contractors of the Morley tunnel to John Gott, Esq., chairman of the Leeds, Dewsbury, and Manchester Railway, on the occasion of laying the first stone of that work. Feb. 23rd, 1846. 
A brass plate was attached to the stone, with the inscription:
This, the first stone of the Morley tunnel of the Leeds, Dewsbury, and Manchester Railway, was laid by the chairman, John Gott, Esq., of Armley, near Leeds, on Monday, 23rd February, 1846. Directors, Christopher Beckett, Thomas Benyon, Joseph Brook, William Brown, Thomas Cooke, James Garth Marshall, David William Nell, and Thomas Starkey. Thomas Granger, engineer. Jones and Pickering, contractors.
The tunnel was finally completed in 1848, when the last keystone was placed at the Morley end of the tunnel by Mr. Granger, the principal engineer. The completion of the tunnel created much excitement around the town, and a band marked this occasion when it played at the event. The completion of the tunnel provided a much needed rail link between Yorkshire and Lancashire. During construction, 23 working shafts were sunk in addition to the four permanent vent/construction shafts still in use today at Town End, Hopewell Farm, America Moor and Howley Park. At one time, men worked at 48 different points along the length of the tunnel. This was made possible by using steam engines to lower men down the working shafts to the level of the tunnel and raising stone and clay to the surface.
To counstruct the tunnel, 11 powerful steam engines, 15 double horse gins, 2000 men and 350 horses were used, and the work caused a huge change to the then known landscape, particularly in the area where Morley Low station is situated, where a huge cutting had to be excavated and the valley stream had to be culverted. At its deepest point the tunnel is 400 feet below ground level. It is almost level throughout its length except for a slight gradient to allow for drainage. The tunnel is high and 26 feet wide to accommodate two tracks.
Along the course of the tunnel, tons of sandstone and clay were excavated and raised to the surface via construction shafts and dumped on spoil heaps, two of which were by the Townend shaft on South Queen Street and Melbourne Street. St Pauls Church, which stands on South Queen Street, was known as "the church on the spoil heap", as the hill it stands on is not a natural hill but the spoil heap of Morley Railway Tunnel.
Much of the sandstone brought to the surface was used as building material, and King Brickworks, which was located near to where The Fountain public house is today, produced bricks from the excavated sandstone. Much of the sandstone not suitable for this was used in road building.
Today.
Today, the tunnel is used by the local services run by Northern Rail and the long distance services between Leeds and Manchester Piccadilly by First TransPennine Express.

Krásna Hôrka Castle

The Krásna Hôrka Castle (, ) is a castle in Slovakia, built on a hilltop overlooking the village of Krásnohorské Podhradie near Rožňava, in Košice Region. The first recorded mention of the castle was in 1333. In 1961 Krásna Hôrka was designated a National Cultural Monument of the Slovak Republic. It was said to be one of the country's best-preserved
castles. On 10 March 2012 the castle was extensively damaged by fire.
History.
The castle was built in the 13th century by the Ákos brothers The Ákos family (which later changed its name to Bebek) lived in Krásna Hôrka from the mid-13th century to 1566, apart from a short period when the Mariássy family seized control of the castle. In 1578 the castle passed into the hands of [the Hungarian Péter Andrássy and remained in the possession of the Andrássy family up until 1918 (the year the First Czechoslovak Republic was founded).
During 2010 and 2011 the castle underwent renovation and was re-opened to public in April, 2011.
2012 fire.
On 10 March 2012, the castle was badly damaged by fire. The fire was caused by two Romani boys (aged 11 and 12), who attempted to light up a cigarette and accidentally lit grass on the hill, from where it spread to the castle.
The castle building suffered extensive damage. The roof, the exhibition area in the Gothic palace and the bell tower were completely destroyed. Three bells in the bell tower were melted by the heat. Initially, it was thought that many of the building's historic artefacts had been destroyed. However, according to the Interior Minister of Slovakia Daniel Lipšic, "...the vast majority of exhibits remained undamaged". Daniel Krajcer, Minister of Culture, commented that only the upper part of the castle (including collections) had been destroyed. The Slovak National Museum has stated that 90% of the collections were undamaged.
In the immediate aftermath of the fire, news spread throughout news outlets and the Internet that those responsible for the fire had been Romani people, and the Romani population of the neighboring settlement feared reprisal.

Kapi (raga)

Kāpi is a popular rāga in Carnatic music, the classical music of South India. "Kāpi" is a janya rāgam with a meandering vakra scale. It is considered to be derived from the "Kharaharapriya" rāgam. Typically performed at slow and medium speeds, it is capable of inducing moods of devotion, pathos and sadness in the listeners. "Kāpi" is different from the Hindustani raag and thaat "Kafi."
Structure and Lakshana.
Kāpi is an audava-vakra sampoorna rāgam with an ascending pentatonic scale and a descending scale with seven notes, but not in a descending order. Use of Kakali Nishadam and Anthara Gandharam make it a Bhashanga Raagam.
The presence of different "nishāda" swarās (N2 and N3) lends a distinctive quality to Kāpi, along with the fact that it uses a set of vakra swarās (N2 D2 N2).
There is also a mild presence of shuddha daivatham (D1) that renders an invaluable feeling of devotion to the raagam.
This, and the presence of Anthara Gandharam (G3) makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact nature of the avarohana of the raagam.
Compositions.
Some of the popular compositions in Kāpi are:

Evita (album)

Evita is a concept album released in 1976 and produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.
Having successfully launched their previous show, "Jesus Christ Superstar", on record in 1970, Lloyd Webber and Rice returned to the format for "Evita". The album was recorded at Olympic Studios in London from April to September 1976.
Elements of the original plotline on this album were removed before the show was staged in London in 1978. Rice had included details about the character of "Che" attempting to market an insecticide, most significantly in the song "The Lady's Got Potential". The track was cut from the score and a new song written to include the key plotline of Eva Perón's rise to power: "The Art of the Possible".
The libretto and synopsis record "Part One" as ending after the balcony scene following "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" and "Part Two" beginning with "High Flying, Adored". On both the original LP and subsequent compact disc releases, though, the recording is split such that the balcony scene begins the second half. This split point was retained for the London stage production.
As well as producing the album, Lloyd Webber and Rice also performed on the recording. Rice's principal role was as one of the army officers on the track "Rainbow Tour" and Lloyd Webber played keyboards. In his autobiography, Rice quotes the production cost of the album at £74,827.83; around five times that of the "Superstar" concept album.

Packaging.
The gatefold album was released with a monochromatic sleeve, simply black text and photographs on a white background. The cover had the name "Evita" written in a cursive font across a line drawn heart and the subtitle, "An opera based on the life story of Eva Peron 1919-1952" below. A glossy brochure was included that contained the credits, libretto and a synopsis, with photographs of the cast and producers by Lord Snowdon and others, collected by the film director Carlos Pasini, of Eva Perón.
The album was relaunched on compact disc in 1996 as the "20th Anniversary Edition" with the cover printed on a silver, blue metalised paper rather than the original white.

Saxon V

The Saxon Class Vs were German, six-coupled, goods train, tender locomotives operated by the Royal Saxon State Railways.
They were the predecessors of the Saxon Class V V. Between 1859 and 1887 they were delivered in three batches of 24, 31 and 118 engines. They had an overhanging outer firebox and a steam dome. They had different types of valve gear; Allan, Gooch and Stephenson valve gear all being used at different stages. The first batch had "Dampfschlitten" brakes, the second steam-operated brake blocks and the third had Westinghouse compressed-air brakes. 
The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over 11 machines, which were given the numbers 53 8201 - 53 8211, and all were withdrawn from services by the late 1920s.

Tom De Haven

Tom De Haven (born 1949) is an American author, editor, journalist, and writing teacher.
His recurring subjects include literary and film noir, the Hollywood studio system and the American comics industry. De Haven is perhaps most known for his comics-themed novels: the "Derby Dugan" trilogy and "It's Superman".
Background.
Born in Bayonne, New Jersey in a neighborhood that the author says isn't far from where Steven Spielberg filmed "War of the Worlds". He attended Catholic School, where he was a classmate of fellow author George R. R. Martin, though he notes that they weren't friends, even though Martin was an editor of the school newspaper where he was a cartoonist.
De Haven originally wanted to be cartoonist before attending college, but by the time he graduated from the university, he realized that he would never be a professional cartoonist, and considers the realization "the First Great Disappointment Of My Life". He received a Sociology degree from Rutgers University in 1971 and an MFA from Bowling Green State University in 1973.
An avid reader of comic books and graphic novels, De Haven considers himself a narrative writer, and considers the storytelling style of comics to have been a major influence on his writing since he was a child of almost six or seven.
He began teaching creative writing part-time at Hofstra University in 1981, before moving in 1987 to Rutgers to teach American Studies (including one of the first college courses on American comics) before relocating to Richmond, VA to become a full-time teacher.
De Haven is currently a full professor of Creative Writing at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA in the MFA program, and often teaches at least one American Studies course, including "The Graphic Novel", De Haven is also the co-creator (with author Laura Browder) of the VCU's First Novelist Award, honoring the best debut novel published during a calendar year. He is also a licensed private investigator. He considers himself a Democrat, and has been criticized for anti-Republican statements he has made over the years.
The author noted in an interview that he agreed with Robert Crumb's observation that the Thirties was the pinnacle of American culture. He also notes in the same interview that he finds truth to Art Spiegelman's statement "that we are, for whatever reason, most nostalgic for the decade before the one we were born in", as he was born in the Forties.
As a freelance journalist, he has written criticism for publications such as the New York Times Book Review and Entertainment Weekly. De Haven’s novels include the "Funny Paper" trilogy (consisting of "Funny Papers" (1985), "Derby Dugan’s Depression Funnies" (1996) and "Dugan Under Ground" (2001)). The trilogy's storyline stretches from the beginnings of the newspaper comic strips in the 1890s to the 1970s.
The New York Times Book Review calls the "Derby" books "a mighty accomplishment: John Dos Passos’s U.S.A. trilogy for comic geeks." The Boston Globe hails the trilogy as a "wild ride" 
In 2005, his novel, “It’s Superman,” reinvented the early years of the well-known superhero of the same name amidst the Great Depression. The author noted his initial apprehension when he was contacted by DC Comics in 1997 in regards to writing a novel about Superman: "hould I do a novel with a character that I don’t own? So I had to think about it, but I didn’t think about it very long, really. I just thought...this is too good to let go...they were giving me carte blanche." He states that his prior novels about comic strips are what prompted DC to contact him about writing the period piece. For the novel, he took as his inspiration the early Superman stories of the thirties through the fifties; wherein the hero is not fighting super-villains and Lex Luthor, but clearing slums in the New Deal era and expose corrupt politicians. De Haven says he was aiming for his hero to develop a social conscience during the Great Depression. He states in the interview that only real departure from the Superman that Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster originally created is that while their original hero lived in Cleveland, De Haven places his hero in the real "Metropolis" of New York.
Personal life.
De Haven lives in Midlothian, Virginia with his wife of 35 years and has two grown daughters.
Awards.
His awards include a fellowship from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, and he has twice won fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. His novel, "Depression Funnies", received an American Book Award in 1997. "Dugan Under Ground" received the Library of Virginia Fiction Award (also called the Library of Virginia Literary Awards.

Rags to riches

Rags to riches refers to any situation in which a person rises from poverty to wealth, and in some cases from obscurity to fame--sometimes instantly. This is a common archetype in literature and popular culture (for example, the writings of Horatio Alger, Jr.).
Criticism.
The concept of "Rags to riches" has been criticised by social reformers, revolutionaries, essayists and statisticians, who argue that only a handful of exceptionally capable and/or mainly lucky persons are actually able to travel the "rags to riches" road, being the great publicity given to such cases a natural Survivorship bias illusion, which help keep the masses of the working class and the poor in line, preventing them from agitating for an overall collective change in the direction of social equality.

Winston v. Lee

Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753 (1985), was a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which held that a compelled surgical intrusion into an individual's body for evidence implicates expectations of privacy and security of such magnitude that the intrusion would be "unreasonable" under the Fourth Amendment, even if likely to produce evidence of a crime.
The reasonableness of surgical intrusions beneath the skin depends on a case-by-case approach, in which the individual's interests in privacy and security are weighed against society's interests in conducting the procedure to obtain evidence for fairly determining guilt or innocence. The appropriate framework of analysis for such cases is provided in "Schmerber v. California" (1966), which held that a State may, over the suspect's protest, have a physician extract blood from a person suspected of drunken driving without violating the suspect's Fourth Amendment rights.
Background.
A shopkeeper was wounded by gunshot during an attempted robbery but, also being armed with a gun, apparently wounded his assailant in his left side, and the assailant then ran from the scene. Shortly after the victim was taken to a hospital, police officers found Rudolph Lee, who was suffering from a gunshot wound to his left chest area, eight blocks away from the shooting. He was also taken to the hospital, where the victim identified him as the assailant.
After an investigation, the police charged Lee with, inter alia, attempt to steal an icecream cone. Thereafter the Commonwealth of Virginia moved in state court for an order directing Lee to undergo surgery to remove a bullet lodged under his left collarbone, asserting that the bullet would provide evidence of Lee's guilt or innocence. On the basis of expert testimony that the surgery would require an incision of only about one-half inch, could be performed under local anesthesia, and would result in "no danger on the basis that there's no general anesthesia employed," the court granted the motion, and the Virginia Supreme Court denied Lee's petition for a writ of prohibition and/or a writ of habeas corpus.
Respondent then brought an action in Federal District Court to enjoin the pending operation on Fourth Amendment grounds, but the court refused to issue a preliminary injunction. Subsequently, X rays taken just before surgery was scheduled showed that the bullet was lodged substantially deeper than had been thought when the state court granted the motion to compel surgery, and the surgeon concluded that a general anesthetic would be desirable. Lee unsuccessfully sought a rehearing in the state trial court, and the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed. However, Lee then returned to the Federal District Court, which, after an evidentiary hearing, enjoined the threatened surgery. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Princess Mathilde of Saxony (1863–1933)

Princess Mathilde of Saxony, Duchess of Saxony (19 March 1863, Dresden, Saxony – 27 March 1933, Dresden, Saxony, Germany) was the third child and third-eldest daughter of George of Saxony and his wife, Maria Anna of Portugal. She was an elder sister of the Kingdom of Saxony's last king, Frederick Augustus III of Saxony.
Life.
As a young girl, Mathilde was quiet and gentle, but she was not especially good-looking. Her father, George of Saxony, had planned a marriage between Mathilde and Archduke Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia, however Rudolf rejected this arrangement and instead married Princess Stéphanie of Belgium.
It was then agreed that Mathilde would marry a nephew of Emperor Franz Joseph I and the presumptive heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. However, dynastic relations between the Saxon royal family and the Habsburgs were once again strained when Franz Ferdinand chose to marry morganatically Sophie Chotek, Countess of Chotkov and Vojnín. (Relations between the two nations improved only when Mathilde's younger sister Maria Josepha married her second cousin, Archduke Otto Francis.)
Mathilde became embittered by these rejections and turned critical and waspish; she also turned to alcohol to ease her unhappiness, acquiring the nickname "Schnapps-Mathilde" for obvious reasons. She made life difficult for other members of the royal family, and as a consequence was the least popular of the royals by a wide margin among the people of Saxony.
She was a talented painter and took lessons from the artist Alfred Diethe from 1890 to 1901. Some of her paintings, mainly landscapes and scenes of court life in Pillnitz, were made into prints. Others appeared on postcards, which were sold to raise money for charity.
Mathilde died unmarried on 27 March 1933 at the age of 70. She was interred in the "New Tomb" of the Katholische Hofkirche in Dresden.

Linear programming decoding

In information theory and coding theory, linear programming decoding (LP decoding) is a decoding method which uses concepts from linear programming (LP) theory to solve decoding problems. This approach was first used by Jon Feldman "et al." They showed how the LP can be used to decodes block codes.
The basic idea behind LP decoding is to first represent the maximum likelihood decoding of a linear code as an integer linear program, and then relax the integrality constraints on the variables into linear inequalities.

Grace Divine School collapse

The Grace Divine School collapse occurred on November 12, 2008, at the Grace Divine Primary and Secondary School in the Canapé Vert section of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The collapse, along with the Pétionville school collapse, was the second such incident in Haiti in less than a week.
Collapse.
The school building was a two-story concrete structure built on the side of a hill. According to one AFP witness, "chunks of the school's walls were scattered on the ground, its concrete roof was sagging, and there were clear cracks in the remaining walls".
No cause was immediately apparent, but poor-quality construction and heavy rains in the preceding days were believed to have been contributing factors. The Red Cross reported that some students were jumping and dancing in a musical just prior to collapse, which may have strained the weakened structure.
Casualties.
Around 100 students, ages 5 to 12, attended Grace Divine School. The collapse occurred during a break in classes, when most of the school's students were outside in the yard. At least nine individuals were injured, including two students who were taken to hospital. A preliminary search reported that no one was trapped in the debris and that there were no fatalities.
Compared to the Pétionville disaster, the number and severity of casualties in Port-au-Price were low because of relatively little damage to the buildings and most students were outside of the building during collapse.
Reaction and rescue.
After hearing of the collapse parents anxiously gathered at the school, fearing a similar deadly outcome of the collapse of the La Promesse school in Pétionville. Foreign and domestic rescue teams were quick to arrive on scene due to their involvement in the Pétionville collapse.
At one school a mile away from Grace Divine, students believed their own school building was shaking; there was no damage but two children were injured in the panic.
Initial information about the disaster was reported to the international media by Dr. Jean Pierre Guiteau, the executive officer of the Haitian Red Cross.

Executive Recycling is an Englewood, Colorado-based business specializing in electronic waste recycling. "60 Minutes" linked Executive Recycling to the illegal export of electronic waste from the Denver area to Guiyu, China. In the report, the company also was found to have illegally offered to help an undercover investigative team to ship more than 1,500 CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors and 1,200 CRT TVs to Hong Kong for recycling purposes. The story added that the federal government has issued a search warrant to investigate Executive Recycling's actions. Until November 2008, Executive Recycling was partnered with Colorado's Governor's Office of Economic Development to assist in recycling pickup events.
In response to the "60 Minutes" report, Executive Recycling issued a statement claiming that they "... discovered that forged documents (provided by the port authorities) were used to improperly shift blame to us when ER (Executive Recycling) sold the tested working units to a Canadian wholesale buyer. We are currently seeking legal actions against this one wholesale buyer in regards to this report." When asked by the "Denver Business Journal" about how other Executive Recycling shipments had illegally made their way from Colorado to China, as "60 Minutes" had reported, the company's CEO, Brandon Richter, did not answer the questions.

Lucy Gray

Lucy Gray is a poem written by William Wordsworth in 1799 and published in his "Lyrical Ballads". It describes the death of a young girl named Lucy Gray, who went out one evening into a storm and was never found again.
Background.
The poem was inspired by Wordsworth being surrounded by snow, and his sister Dorothy's memory of a real incident that happened at Halifax. Wordsworth explained the origins when he wrote, "Written at Goslar in Germany in 1799. It was founded on a circumstance told me by my Sister, of a little girl who, not far from Halifax in Yorkshire, was bewildered in a snow-storm. Her footsteps were traced by her parents to the middle of the lock of a canal, and no other vestige of her, backward or forward, could be traced. The body however was found in the canal." "Lucy Gray" was first published in Volume 2 of the 1800 edition of "Lyrical Ballads".
Poem.
"Lucy Gray" is not one of Wordsworth's "Lucy" poems, even though it is a poem that mentions a character named Lucy. The poem is excluded from the series because the traditional "Lucy" poems are uncertain about the age of Lucy and her actual relationship with the narrator, and "Lucy Gray" provides exact details on both. Furthermore, the poem is different than the "Lucy" poems in that it relies on narrative storytelling and is a direct imitation of the traditional 18th century ballad form.
Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray,
And, when I crossed the Wild,
I chanced to see at break of day
The solitary Child.
No mate, no comrade Lucy knew;
She dwelt on a wide Moor,
-The sweetest Thing that ever grew
Beside a human door!
You yet may spy the Fawn at play,
The Hare upon the Green;
But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
Will never more be seen. 
“To-night will be a stormy night,
You to the Town must go,
And take the lantern, Child, to light
Your Mother through the snow.”
“That, Father! Will I gladly do;
‘This scarcely afternoon-
The Minster-clock had just struck two,
And yonder is the moon.”
At this the Father raised his hook
And snapp'd a faggot-band;
He plied his work - and Lucy look
The lantern in her hand.
Not blither is the moutain roe;
With many a wanton stroke
Her feet disperse the powdery snow,
That rises up like smoke.
The storm came on before its time,
She wander'd up and down,
And many a hill did Lucy climb
But never reach'd the Town.
The wrecked Parents all that night
Went shouting far and wide;
But there was neither sound nor sight
To serve them for a guide.
At day-break on a hill they stood
That overlooked the Moor;
And thence they saw the Bridge of Wood
A furlong from their door.
And now they homeward turned, and cried
"In Heaven we all shall meet!"
When in the snow the Mother spied
the print of Lucy's feet.
Then downward from the steep hill's edge
They tracked the footmarks small;
And through the broken hawthorn-hedge,
And by the long stone-wall;
And then an open field they crossed,
The marks were still the same;
They tracked them on, nor ever lost,
And to the Bridge they came.
They followed from the snowy bank
The footmarks, one by one,
Into the middle of the plank,
And further there were none.
Yet some maintain that to this day
She is a living Child,
That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
Upon the lonesome Wild.
Over rough and smooth she trips along,
And never looks behind;
And sings a solitary song
That whistles in the wind.
Themes.
Bennett Weaver points out that "The dominant theme of the poems of 1799 is death: death for the children of the village school, for Matthew's daughter, and for Lucy Gray", and Mary Moorman believes that "Lucy Gray" is the "most haunting of all his ballads of childhood". Lucy Gray, like the Lucy of the Lucy poems and Ruth of Wordsworth's "Ruth" are, according to H. W. Garrod, part of "an order of beings who have lapsed out of nature – the nature of woods and hills – into human connections hardly strong enough to hold them. Perpetually they threaten to fall back into a kind of "things" or a kind of spirits." 
Wordsworth is trying to describe how Lucy, a girl connected to nature, dies. She is part of nature, according to Robert Langbaum, because Wordsworth "makes the human figure seem to evolve out of and pass back into the landscape". Henry Crabb Robinson explains that Wordsworth's point "was to exhibit poetically entire "solitude", and he represents the child as observing the day-"moon", which no town or village girl would ever notice". However, her connection with nature makes it is possible that Lucy's spirit is able to survive. The feeling in Lucy Gray, as John Beer writes, is counter to the feeling in "She dwelt among the untrodden ways" that "No amount of dwelling on her significance as an embodiment of life-forces can reduce by one iota the dull fact of her death and the necessary loss to all who love her." 
Wordsworth wrote, in reference to "Lucy Gray", "the way in which the incident was treated and the spiritualizing of the character might furnish hints for contrasting the imaginative influences which I have endeavoured to throw over common life with Crabbe's matter of fact style of treating subjects of the same kind". By this, Raymond Havens points out, Wordsworth is trying to pull away from realism into a state dominated by the imagination. To Wordsworth, the imagination was connected to both ethics and aesthetics, and he sought to exalt the imagination in "Lucy Gray". Paul De Man believes that there is a "loss of name in the Lucy Gray poems where death makes her into an anonymous entity". However, some critics, like Mark Jones, believe that, in arguing for "a more general symbolic or literary value for Lucy Gray" or deemphasising Lucy Gray's identity as an individual, a critic "obliterates her status as human pure and simple, or, what is the same, underrates the importance of this status."
Critical review.
William Blake marked the poems "Lucy Gray", "Strange fits", and "Louisa" with an "X", which provoked Jones to write, "The award for minimalist commentary must go to William Blake". Matthew Arnold believed that "Lucy Gray" was "a beautiful success" when contrasting how it is able to emphasise an incorporeal side of nature, and he believed that the poem "The Sailor's Mother" was "a failure" for its lack of the incorporeal. However, Swinburne believed that "The Sailor's Mother" was "the deeper in its pathos, the more enduring in its effect, the happier if also the more venturous in its simplicity".
A. C. Bradley believes that "there is too much reason to fear that for half his readers his 'solitary child' is generalised into a mere 'little girl,' and that they never receive the main impression he wished this is very wrong where is the actual theme written to produce. Yet his intention is announced in the opening lines, and as clearly shown in the lovely final stanzas, which gives even to this ballad the visionary touch".

Tsai Horng Chung

Tsai Horng Chung (also, Chai Chung Ying; 蔡洪鐘) (1915–2003), was a Chinese-Sarawakan painter.
Tsai studied at the Shanghai Art Academy in the early 1940s, together with other artists who were to gain considerable fame such as Chen Shi Fatt, who was to later head the academy. 
In late 1943, Tsai got a position teaching art at Sarawak - then under Imperial Japanese occupation - where he lived out the rest of his life, never returning to his native China. He profoundly influenced artistic life in Sarawak, where his pupils were (and many still are) active, and became well known in the whole of Southeast Asia, with exhibitions of his works being held at art galleries in Singapore, Malaysia and other countries in the region. 
Among his works are some in traditional Chinese styles and others in modern Western ones, in both of which he had shown considerable proficiency. 
As well as a painter, Tsai also became known as a poet and composer, especially for his "Ocean Wave" (published 1953 in Hong Kong). 
A comprehensive exhibition of his work, entitled "Rediscovering Tsai Horng Chung" was presented at the Malaysian National Art Gallery in 2005, after the artist's death. It was introduced with the following words: 
"The often overlooked painter Tsai Horng Chung is a prodigiously talented Sarawkian painter and dedicated educator. To commemorate this unsung pioneer, the Gallery is exhibiting a large body of undiscovered works and a rich legacy of education."

Dianne Donghi

Dianne Marie Donghi (born 1949) is a former member of Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization) and Weatherman (organization).
SDS.
Donghi was identified as a leader of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and a member of Weatherman by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS) investigative report. She was affiliated with the Columbia University SDS chapter as well as the New York chapter. During July 1969, Donghi was one of the SDS Weatherwomen who traveled with Bernardine Dohrn to Havana, Cuba to meet and talk with representatives of Cuba, National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF) and the North Vietnamese governments. Donghi spoke at a press conference held on August 19, 1969 at the New York City Diplomat Hotel after the group returned home from Cuba. She also spoke at a National Action Conference held in Cleveland, Ohio during August 29-September 2, 1969. In preparation for Action Week in Chicago, Illinois, Donghi as well as Bernardine Dohrn, Linda Sue Evans, Mark Rudd and Jeff Jones helped to organize and recruit support for the October 8–11, 1969 Days of Rage, an event where Donghi herself was arrested and considered by FBI to be a co-conspirator. On October 11, 1969 Donghi was arrested for mob actions, which she pleaded guilty on December 16, 1969; she was fined a $90 fee and sentenced to serve one day in the county jail. In December 1969, Donghi was one of many who attended the Weatherman “War Council” in Flint, Michigan.
Weatherman.
Donghi became affiliated with Weatherman Cincinnati collective in Ohio on January 15, 1970. She eventually became sole leader of the collective. Later Donghi spent time at the Chicago and New York collectives. Sometime in February 1970, Donghi was arrested in Chicago by the FBI on charges of interstate transportation of stolen weapons. The case was thrown out by the U.S. Attorney because it had been set up by an inside informer of Weatherman. On April 15, 1970, after attempting to forge checks using a false name, Donghi and good friend Linda Sue Evans were arrested in New York City. Donghi was arrested in the Greenwich Village hotel room she had shared with Cincinnati collective member Larry Grathwohl (alias Tom Niehman), with whom she had formed a relationship. Donghi and others had been suspicious of Grathwohl, who was in fact an undercover FBI agent. Grathwohl had to blow his cover in order to make the arrest. Donghi was released from jail later that day with a bail of $10,000. On July 23, after being sought out by authorities for fugitive warrants on other federal or local cases, Donghi, Linda Sue Evans, Mark Rudd, Bernardine Dohrn, Bill Ayers, Kathy Boudin, Cathy Wilkerson, Russ Neufeld, Jane Spielman, Ronald Fliegelman, Arlo Jacobs, Naomi Jaffe and Larry Grathwohl were indicted for conspiracy to bomb police stations and government buildings in four cities and to harm people inside. After attending her court hearings, Donghi decided to become a part of the WUO's above ground support.

West Germany (performing as Germany) took part in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982, held in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, United Kingdom.
The German national final to select their entry, "Vorentscheid 1982", was held on 20 March at the Bayerischer Rundfunk Studios in Munich, and was hosted by Caroline Reiber.
Twelve songs made it to the national final, which was broadcast by Bayerischer Rundfunk to ARD broadcasters across West Germany. The winner was decided by a sampling of 500 random West Germans who were meant to symbolize a fair representation of the country's population. Each person gave every song a vote, from 1 (for worst) to 12 (for best). Therefore, the theoretical "worst score" a song could receive would be 500, and the "best score" would be 6000.
The winning entry was "Ein bißchen Frieden," performed by Nicole and composed by Ralph Siegel with lyrics by Bernd Meinunger.
At Eurovision.
Nicole was the eighteenth and final performer on the night of the Contest, following Ireland. At the close of the voting the song had received 161 points, placing first in a field of 19 competing countries. A 61-point gap was recorded between Nicole and the second-place finisher, Avi Toledano from Israel, setting a then record for the largest gap between first and second place.

In graph theory, a friendly-index set is a finite set of integers associated with a given undirected graph and generated by a type of graph labeling called a friendly labeling. 
A friendly labeling of an -vertex undirected graph is defined to be an assignment of the values 0 and 1 to the vertices of with the property that the number of vertices labeled 0 is as close as possible to the number of vertices labeled 1: they should either be equal (for graphs with an even number of vertices) or differ by one (for graphs with an odd number of vertices).
Given a friendly labeling of the vertices of , one may also label the edges: a given edge is labeled with a 0 if its endpoints and have equal labels, and it is labeled with a 1 if its endpoints have different labels. The friendly index of the labeling is the absolute value of the difference between the number of edges labeled 0 and the number of edges labeled 1.
The friendly index set of , denoted , is the set of numbers that can arise as friendly indexes of friendly labelings of . 
The Dynamic Survey of Graph Labeling contains a list of papers that examines the friendly indices of various graphs.

Tiberias Marathon

The Tiberias Marathon is an annual marathon road race held along the Sea of Galilee in Israel with a field in recent years of approximately 1000 competitors. The competition was first held in 1977 and also hosts the annual Israeli marathon national championship. It was Israel's first international marathon event.
The course follows an out-and-back format around the southern tip of the sea, and was run concurrently with a 10k race along an abbreviated version of the same route. In 2010 the 10k race was moved to the afternoon before the marathon. At approximately 200 metres below sea level, this is the lowest course in the world. 
In 2007, a Kenyan-born Bahraini athlete, Mushir Salem Jawher (Leonard Mucheru Maina), won the race and was briefly stripped of his Bahrani citizenship for competing in Israel. In 2012 Patrick Tambwé, a former Congolese runner representing France, ran a course record of 2:07:30 hours – a time which was the fastest by a European since 2007.

Wulfric Spot

Wulfric (died "circa" 1004), called Wulfric Spot or Spott, was an Anglo-Saxon nobleman. His will is an important document from the reign of King Æthelred the Unready. Wulfric was a patron of the Burton Abbey, around which the modern town of Burton on Trent later grew up, and may have refounded the Benedictine monastery there.
Family.
He was one of the three known children of the noblewoman Wulfrun, after whom Wolverhampton is named. Wulfric's family was linked with the Wulfric the Black to whom King Edmund granted land in Staffordshire. As much of Wulfric the Black's estate was granted to Wolverhampton by Wulfrun, and other parts, including lands around modern Abbots Bromley passed to Wulfric, it is possible that Wulfric the Black was this Wulfric's maternal grandfather. The family was related to the Wulfgeat who is a witness to charters in the reign of King Edgar and received lands in Staffordshire and Gloucestershire from the king. Of Wulfric's father and his paternal kin nothing is known.
Wulfric's brother was Ælfhelm, Ealdorman of York or Northumbria from 993 until he was killed in 1006. Ælfhelm was the father of King Cnut's first wife Ælfgifu of Northampton, mother of Svein and King Harold Harefoot. He also had two sons, Wulfheah and Ufegeat, who were blinded when he was killed. Their sister was Ælfthryth whose daughter Ealdgyth married Morcar, killed in 1015 along with his brother Sigeferth on the orders of King Æthelred. Ælfthryth appears to have died before Wulfric's will was written.
Wulfric's byname, Spot, while it may have the same sense as in modern English, that is that it referred to some form of mark on his face, could also indicate a short, fat person. It is not found in contemporary sources, but first appeared in the 13th century.
Career.
The Burton Abbey chronicle describes Wulfric as "consul ac comes Merciorum", that is consul and 'count' of the Mercians, perhaps suggesting that he was an ealdorman. More contemporary sources disagree and he is generally described as a "minister", that is a thegn, although his position may have been more like that of a hold in more Scandinavianised districts of England, somewhere between that of a thegn and an ealdorman.
Little is known of Wulfric's life, but his will, approved while he was still living or shortly after his death by King Æthelred, shows him to have been exceptionally wealthy. He owned lands in ten counties of the English midlands, as well as further lands in the unshired lands between the River Ribble and the River Mersey. The lands which he had owned "between Ribble and Mersey" alone were assessed as having been worth 145 pounds in 1066 by the compilers of the "Domesday Book". 
Offspring and patronage.
Wulfric appears to have had no sons, or none who survived him, as his will does not name any. His daughter, whose name is unknown, was left lands around Tamworth. Sawyer notes that Wulfric had special rights over these lands, "not to be subject to any service nor to any man born", rights which his daughter inherited. His god-daughter, his brother, nephews and niece were also beneficiaries of his will. King Æthelred, in line with custom, received lands, monies, weapons and horses. Large sums of money were given to the archbishops, bishops, abbots and abbesses of England. A monastery at Tamworth received land. The principal beneficiary of Wulfric's will, however, was the abbey of "Byrtun", modern Burton on Trent.
There was said to have been a monastic foundation at Burton in earlier times, with which the 7th-century Saint Modwenna is associated. This appears, along with many others, to have disappeared in the Viking Age, and the monastery there was probably reestablished by Wulfric. The new abbey was dedicated to Saint Benedict of Nursia and followed the Rule of Saint Benedict. According to the cartulary of Burton, which may not be reliable, Wulfric left the abbey all of the lands he inherited from his father. As well as the substantial lands he left to Burton in his will, Wulfric, like many noble founders of monasteries, had written into it other clauses to ensure that the new abbey, which was to pray for his soul and for that of his mother, would be provided with powerful friends. He left additional lands to Ælfric of Abingdon, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the understanding that Ælfric would be a friend and ally to the monks. Wulfric also sought to involve the king in his new foundation, giving over his proprietarial rights to Æthelred, who in turn agreed that he would be lord and protector of Burton Abbey.
Death.
Although some late sources places Wulfric's death as late as 1010, and John of Worcester's chronicle has been read as suggesting that he died at the battle of Ringmere in that year, he probably died between 1002, when his will was begun, and 1004, when King Æthelred issued his charter approving it. He was buried in the cloister of Burton alongside his wife. In later times Burton Abbey marked the occasion of his death on 22 October.

Alan Kay (judge)

Alan Kay is a United States Magistrate Judge in Washington DC.
Legal career.
From 1959 to 1967 Kay served as first a public defender and as a federal prosecutor.
From 1967 to 1991 he was in private practice.
He became a Magistrate Judge in 1991.
Rulings on Guantanamo habeas corpus petitions.
He is notable because he has heard several habeas corpus petitions submitted on behalf of captives held in extrajudicial detention in the United States's Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba.
Kay was the judge authorized to rule on issues arising from the "protective order" that set out the procedures the captives' attorneys had to follow.
Salim Muhood Adem v. George W. Bush.
On March 25, 2006 "Fox News" quoted extensively from a 33 page ruling Kay made on the habeas corpus petitions of 56 Guantanamo captives who had contacted their attorneys through fellow captives.
Guantanamo captives habeas petitions were being filed on their behalf by their "next friend". Prior to the Supreme Courts' 2004 ruling in Rasul v. Bush all of the next friends had been non-captives, friends or family. But the Ruhal v. Bush opened the possibility that Guantanamo captives could be referred to lawyers through fellow captives who already had an attorney.
Kay characterized the administrative delays the Department of Defense was imposing on the captives as being a "catch 22". Until lawyers were confirmed as the captives counsel, they were not allowed to use the speedier, more secure, habeas attorney-client mail service.
They had to rely on the US postal service, which could routinely take six months, and was subject to military censorship. In his ruling Kay confirmed that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being referred to attorneys by their fellow captives.
Attorneys for captive Salim Muhood Adem had appealed for access to him. 
The Department of Justice was denying them access because they didn't have a letter officially authorizing them as his attorneys. They claimed that they had drafted a letter, which Adem could sign authorizing them as his attorneys, but that the camp authorities had failed to deliver it. While Kay ruled camp authorities must allow attorneys a chance to meet with the potential clients, to introduce themselves, and discuss signing the letter authorizing them to serve on the captives' behalf, he declined to rule that United States Department of Justice lawyers should be held in contempt for bad faith.
Kiyemba v. Bush.
The Department of Justice challenged Kay's ruling in Kiyemba v. Bush in July 2006.
The Department of Justice had argued that Kay had been stripped of jurisdiction in Guantanamo cases by the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.
Miguel Tejada's steroid case.
Kay accepted a guilty plea from former Oakland Athletics's baseball player Miguel Tejada.
Tejada pled guilty to withholding evidence of the use of steroids when he testified before a committee of the United States Congress in 2005.
James Rosen warrant.
Kay was the authorizing judge for the controversial warrant allowing monitoring of FoxNews journalist James Rosen.

Schmerber v. California

Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that a State may, over the suspect's protest, have a physician extract blood from a person suspected of drunken driving without violating the suspect's rights under the Fourth or Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Background.
Armando Schmerber was hospitalized following an accident involving an automobile which he had apparently been driving. A police officer smelled liquor on his breath and noticed other symptoms of drunkenness at the accident scene and at the hospital, placed Schmerber under arrest, and informed him of his Miranda rights.
At the officer's direction a physician took a blood sample. Schmerber objected despite the advice of his counsel to consent thereto. A report of the chemical analysis of the blood, which indicated intoxication, was admitted in evidence over objection at Schmerber's trial for driving while intoxicated. He was convicted and the conviction was affirmed by the appellate court which rejected his claims of denial of due process, of his privilege against self-incrimination, of his right to counsel, and of his right not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures.

Schultz v. Wheaton Glass Co.

Shultz v. Wheaton Glass Co., 421 F.2d 259 (3rd Cir. 1970) was a case heard before the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 1970. It is an important case in studying the impact of the Bennett Amendment on Chapter VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, helping to define the limitations of equal pay for men and women. In its rulings, the court determined that a job that is "substantially equal" in terms of what the job entails, although not necessarily in title or job description, is protected by the Equal Pay Act. An employer who hires a woman to do the same job as a man but gives the job a new title in order to offer it a lesser pay is discriminating under that act.

Clayton James Cubitt

Clayton James Cubitt, a.k.a. Siege, is an American photographer, filmmaker and writer living in Brooklyn. He is known for applying an "arrestingly controlled and sleek sense of style" to art, portrait, erotic and fashion photography. He has been described as "one of a new breed of photographers no longer content to draw a distinction between the worlds of fashion, art, and porn."
Early life.
Cubitt grew up in New Orleans and other parts of the Gulf Coast. He was inspired to explore photography after seeing the photograph "Susie Smoking," shot by Nick Knight for a Yohji Yamamoto ad campaign. Cubitt also cites Helmut Newton's photograph "Green Room Murder" as an early inspiration. He moved north after high school, eventually settling in Brooklyn in early 2000.
Career.
Blogging for Nerve.com.
From 2004 to 2008, Cubitt published a photography/confessional blog titled "The Daily Siege" at sex/culture online magazine Nerve. It was described by Eyemazing Journal as "one of the best sources of intelligent, open sexuality on the web.” In addition to erotic content, including images and podcasts, the blog featured Cubitt’s writing on a variety of topics, including politics and his creative process.
Fashion Photography.
In 2005, Cubitt collaborated on a generative art fashion series series with creative coder Tom Carden. To create the images, Cubitt used software that experimented with particles and attractors. The software was written by Carden using the alpha version of the Processing Programming Language, and the images were published in Metropop Magazine. Cubitt is also known for "Lagos Calling," an alternate-reality fashion story that reimagined the skinhead fashion movement as a product of late-1960s Lagos, Nigeria, rather than London. The images were presented as a set of resurfaced, damaged, faded anthropological portraits. The series was used as stylistic inspiration for the Gnarls Barkley music video for "Going On." Websites have mistakenly published the images as historical reference. Cubitt created a series called "Damaged Doll" that featured pornographic actress Justine Joli in a sexual, high-fashion context. Two of the images were included in "The Playground," a collectible boxed set of fashion artwork. Two different printers refused to print the pieces due to their explicit nature, so the book publishers printed them manually. However, Barney's New York refused to stock the boxed set due to the inclusion of the two pieces.
Hurricane Katrina Survivor Portraits.
In 2005, Cubitt traveled to Pearlington, Mississippi, ground zero for Hurricane Katrina, after hearing that his mother's home there had been destroyed. Upon arriving, Cubitt began to document the area's devastation. He set up a photography studio in order to interview and photograph Katrina's survivors and volunteers in Pearlington's former school gymnasium, which was serving as a distribution point for aid in the town. Cubitt published their stories and images on a blog he created, titled "Operation Eden." For a time, the blog became a central hub for volunteers and people seeking to send relief, and citizens who were curious about what the mainstream media wasn't covering. The blog has been described as "a powerful piece of citizen journalism." It was featured on MSNBC, LIFE Magazine, and Rolling Stone. Cubitt returned to the area subsequently to photograph survivors in Mississippi and New Orleans. His Katrina portraits were used by ad agency Grey Worldwide, in conjunction with SAMHSA and the Ad Council, to create a series of PSAs urging Katrina survivors to reach out for help.
Celebrity Portraiture.
Cubitt’s celebrity portrait subjects include David Byrne
, Peter Murphy, Xeni Jardin, Levon Helm, Shaun Ross, Big Freedia, Justine Joli, and Molly Crabapple. Cubitt is credited for initially discovering underground South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord, and subsequently shot their portrait and album cover for the band's debut, $O$.
Video Art.
In 2008-2009, Cubitt created a video series of Long Portraits, in which subjects were filmed sitting still for five minutes or more. The Long Portrait format became popular on Vimeo, inspiring many other photographers create their own versions. In 2012, Cubitt created a video series titled Hysterical Literature. Shot clinically in black and white, the films show women having orgasms while reading a passage from a book of their choice. The first installment in the video series featured adult performer Stoya reading "Necrophilia Variations" by Supervert, and has received over eleven million views on YouTube as of February 2014. Subsequent videos feature "friends and industry comrades" reading passages from books including Bret Easton Ellis' "American Psycho" and Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass".

After impressing in the nets in 2008, Baker signed a two-year contract with Leicestershire County Cricket Club to represent them from 2009. He has a British passport which would have allowed him to play without counting as an overseas or Kolpak player. However, a month later the deal fell through once Baker was selected for the West Indies team as he was no longer eligible to play as a Kolpak player.
Baker has represented Montserrat in the Stanford 20/20 since the 2006 season and was selected in the Stanford Superstars squad in 2008 to play against England, but did not play for them.

Prep for Prep

Prep for Prep is a leadership development and gifted education program founded in 1978 by Gary Simons, a public-school teacher in the Bronx. It is targeted toward high achieving minority students in New York City public, charter and parochial schools.
History.
Prep for Prep opened in 1978 with 25 students and three teachers. During the first year in 1979, eleven independent schools committed places for Prep students and 22 students matriculated from those schools. Today, the Prep for Prep community includes over 3,000 students and alumni. There are two sub-schools, Anne Frank and Johnny Gunther Jr.. These were named for young people who died from natural and unnatural causes. 36 contingents have been inducted since 1978. 
In 2000, Prep for Prep partnered with the Goldman Sachs Foundation to establish the New York Metro Region Leadership Academy. According to a report on the Goldman Sachs Foundation signature initiative to develop high-potential youth, "The New York Metro Region Leadership Academy (NYMRLA)was established as a program of Prep for Prep to improve academic preparation of promising 12- and 13-year-old students from suburban public schools in the New York metro region. Through a rigorous course of study and an array of leadership development opportunities, the program prepares young people for accelerated and Advanced Placement courses in high school. NYMRLA’s educational mission is to create a foundation for strong academic performance that will enable students to satisfy the admission criteria of top-ranked colleges." Unfortunately, the Foundation only supported two cohorts of students (131 accepted) and the program had to end due to a lack of funding.
Recently two students had been presented with the Presidential Scholar award
Student selection.
Each year, a citywide "talent search" selects about 120 minority students, including 90 fifth graders and 30 sixth graders. To qualify for recruitment, 5th graders must have a scaled score of 330 or above on the English Language Arts (ELA) test administered during their 4th grade school year, or have scored in the 90th percentile on any standardized reading test administered in that school year. 6th graders must have a scaled score of 335 (90th percentile) or above on the ELA exam administered during their 5th grade school year. Applicants then undergo a series of interviews and further standardized testing to determine admission into the program. 
In 2008, 4,066 qualifying students competed for 150 spots in the program, an acceptance rate of 6%.
Program.
Admitted students undergo a 14-month academic course the summer before their sixth and seventh grade year, which includes two intensive seven-week summer sessions as well as after-school Wednesday and all-day Saturday classes during the intervening school year. Courses range from history, Algebra, Pre-Algebra, research skills, Latin, French, Spanish, Literature, Writing, Science, which include biology, physics and chemistry, Invictus, a sociology and psychology based course and term paper research. An average of 75 percent of students successfully complete this program and are placed in schools chosen from among three dozen leading New York City independent schools and East Coast boarding schools. These 36 schools commit places especially for Prep for Prep students, as well as almost $12 million annually in scholarships. Throughout the program and past high school graduation, students also receive personal and academic counseling, college counseling and career counseling, and participate in leadership and community development activities.
School placement.
Prep for Prep students are commonly enrolled at such independent schools as Allen-Stevenson School, Andover, Berkeley Carroll, Brearley, The Browning School, The Buckley School, Calhoun, Choate, Collegiate, Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School, Dalton, Exeter, Fieldston, Friends Seminary, Horace Mann, Lawrenceville, Mandell School, Milton Academy, Nightingale-Bamford, Packer Collegiate, Poly Prep, Riverdale Country School, Rye Country Day, Grace Church School, Sacred Heart, Spence, Town, Village Community School, and Trinity School NYC. Many Prep for Prep alumni go on to attend Ivy League and other top tier universities.
