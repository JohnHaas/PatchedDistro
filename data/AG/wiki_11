Monrad Metzgen

Monrad Siegfried Metzgen (1894- 13 May 1956, Belize) was a well known national hero of Belize having been a leading citizen in the Colony of British Honduras.
Family.
Captain Monrad Sigfried Metzgen, OBE, JP, VD, was one of the most outstanding sons of British Honduras and his death, which occurred on 14 May 1956, marks the end of a brilliant career.
He was born in Belize (Town) a Belizean Creole of humble parentage in June 1983 and died, suddenly of poisoning, on 14 May 1956. Monrad was the son of Carl Alexander Metzgen, the former Auditor General (1911) of Belize, British Honduras.
Monrad Sigfried Metzgen's mother, Esther Almira Bevans (born on 17 January 1869 in Belize and died in 1944), was the second wife of his father (the first one was Estelle Greene). His father, Carl Alexander Metzgen (born on 24 July 1860 and killed in Petén on 13 March 1930). His grandfather, Charles Alexander Metzgen, was born 1816 in Copenhagen, Denmark the son of Johan Christian Metzgen (1784–1843) a retired Danish naval officer.
Monrad had three children: Louise MBE, Humphrey and Frederick (Bill).
On 17 September 2009, Captain Metzgen was posthumously awarded the Order of Distinction from the Government of Belize in recognition of his dedication to Community and Public Service.
Government Service.
In Belize he received his education at St. Mary’s Primary School, and later at Wesley School and the Diocesan High School for Boys (now St. Michael's College) before entering the British Honduras Civil Service as a Temporary Clerk at Her Majesty's Prison on 4 March 1910. Monrad became an erudite person by his own private studies.
Capt. Metzgen entered the Civil Service as a Copyist on 4 March 1910, and ten years later he was appointed Internal Revenue Officer. Subsequently he acted as District Commissioner in Orange Walk, an Auditor and then Director of Colonial Audits. He was made Chief Income Tax Collector in January 1924. He was Treasury Superintendent in 1932 and District Commissioner in Stann Creek in 1935.
Since then and until (and even after) his retirement from the Service as District Commissioner of Stann Creek some years ago, after an accident in the Stann Creek Valley which only a man of his amazing constitution could possibly have survived. A serious, near-fatal accident eventually caused his retirement in 1939. On several occasions he acted as District Commissioner of the Orange Walk District and as Auditor; and it is worthy of mention in the latter connection that he received special commendation from the Director of Colonial Audit for work done during the period 1927-28. He was appointed Treasury Superintendent in September 1932.
He held this position for three years and assumed the Commissionership of the Stann Creek District in September 1935. His administration was a boom to Stann Creek and the inhabitant of that District will long remember his energetic and productive services. Last year he promoted a successful Goodwill Flight, which took him and other leading citizens of Stann Creek to every section of the Colony. That was the forerunner of a mammoth Agricultural Exhibition planned for Stann Creek but unhappily the sad event which befell the Captain precluded the carrying out of his plans.
Captain Metzgen has served the Government of this country in numerous ways and his services have earned him the thanks and commendation of succeeding Governors and other leaders of state.
Completing nearly 30 years of faithful and very valuable services to the Government and people of British Honduras, Capt. Monrad Sigfried Metzgen OBE., District Commissioner of Stann Creek and Acting Superintendent of the Treasury, Belize, spent the last day in the Civil Service with numerous friends and well-wishers throughout the Colony.
As is mentioned, Capt. Metzgen's retirement was hastened by a disaster which occurred in the Stann Creek Valley during the latter part of last year, when he was nearly crushed to death in a collision while in the execution of his duty. He spent a long period in Stann Creek, Belize and Guatemala City Hospital and his suffering was great. Those who were familiar with his case regarded it as a miracle that he was spared but they attributed the saving of his life largely to his amazing constitution and his indomitable courage. Although he regained much of his power to serve his country, his retirement was deemed necessary.
POSTS HE HELD
Here are some the posts filled by Captain Metzgen in the Government Service: 
Acting Asst. Keeper, King's Warehouse; Internal Revenue Officer; Principal Officer, Income Tax; Special Officer of Customs; Acting Colonial Auditor; Acting District Commissioner of the Orange Walk District; Chief Income Tax Collector; Treasury Superintendent. He was Private Secretary (temporarily) to the Acting Governor (Lt. Col. Maxwell Hinds Smith) on a special mission to the Cayo District in 1922. He also served as Secretary or Member of numerous Government and other Boards and Committees, including in 1926 the Fort George Hotel Committee. He was at one time a member of the Belize Town Board (now the City Council).
Military Service.
Captain Metzgen had a military record that was equally impressive. He joined the British Honduras Mounted Infantry on 1 March 1906 and the next year he went with the force, under Major F.M. Maxwell, to quell a riot at the Stann Creek Railway. The same year he accompanied the force again to Sapodilla Caye on the "City of Belize" to assist in preventing filibustering on the coast of General Bonilla of Honduras.
In 1915 he applied to join the War Contingent but his application was not approved owing to the number of Civil Servants that had already obtained permission to enlist.
He was appointed 2nd Lieutenant of the British Honduras Territorial Forces in June, 1918 and on the formation of the Defence Force in 1928 he was appointed a Lieutenant of this Force. He was in charge of the Defence Force during the first two days after the terrible Belize hurricane of September 1931 and the hard work he put in on the occasion, rescuing the injured and dying, burying the dead and feeding the homeless, won the admiration of all.
The planter and the agricultural cause generally had and still have a stalwart friend in Capt. Metzgen. He has the distinction of being the founder of the British Honduras Agricultural Society and the successes of the great agricultural and industrial exhibitions staged under the auspices of the Society in 1928 and 1931 were due largely to his capable and tireless direction.
In 1927 he convened at Belize an agricultural conference which brought together planters from all sections of the Colony. He was a most useful member of the Agricultural Advisory Committee appointed by His Excellency the Governor and Chief Justice Greenidge as Chairman.
Civil Society.
Captain Metzgen was one of the leading members of the Church of England in British Honduras and served his own church and those of other denominations in a multitude of ways. But we can hardly think of any good cause that did not enlist the support of this good and useful man.
Monrad Metzgen was one of the founders of the British Honduras Agricultural Society; producing an Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition in 1928 and 1931. In 1927, he convened an Agricultural Conference which brought together Planters from all over the Colony. Subsequent to this conference, the Governor of British Honduras appointed an Agricultural Advisory Committee with Monrad as one of its prominent members.
During World War II, he traveled the Colony making speeches on the dire need for agricultural development and become synonymous with his mantra: “grow what we eat and eat what we grow".
ROAD CAMPAIGN
Realising that the lack of roads would retard the agricultural development of the Colony, Capt. Metzgen fathered a Colony-wide propaganda for fords and is slogan was "Roads, Roads and Still More Roads". He organized and was the Chairman of the British Honduras Cyclists Association and his Cross Country Cycle Races demonstrated in a tangible manner the urgency of a road programme for the Colony.
There is also no end to the number of Roads and Committees which have been served by Capt. Metzgen. It will, however, suffice to mention some of the more important ones. For three terms he was a Member of the Belize Town Board under the chairmanship of the Rev. Robert Cleghorn OBE, and for a period he was a member of the Belize Electricity Board. For several years he was Chairman of the St George's Caye Day Celebrations Committee at Belize. He served with the Honorable C. Douglas-Jones and the Honorable Willoughby Bullock on a Treasury Inquiry Committee and he was Secretary to the Colonial Lindbergh's Reception Committee and a Hotel (for Belize) Committee of which the late Honorable Sally Wolffsohn was Chairman. He also acted as Private Secretary for His Excellency Colonel Maxwell Hinds with on a special mission of investigation to El Cayo some years ago. He was the first Treasurer of the Infant Welfare League. By the way, he was also the first President of the Eureka Band and the first President of the Native Jockey Club. He gave to Stann Creek flourishing Poor Relief Organisations.
EDUCATION CAMPAIGN
The cultural and educational advancement of his countrymen always received the attention of Capt. Metzgen. He believed thoroughly in educating the people and the series of propaganda public meetings which he organised and successfully directed under the auspices of the Belize Literary and Debating Club some years ago, will be remembered. In the years when Belize had no Public Library, it grieved him very much and for many years he tried very hard to secure cooperation for the establishment of a Public Library and a Town Hall for Belize. He was Chairman of the Debating Club for 10 years.
He has made no small contribution to the literature of the Colony. The present very helpful Handbook of British Honduras was compiled by him in 1925, with the assistance of Mr. H.E.C. Cain, during the administration of Sir Eyre Hutson KCMG. He was Assistant Editor of the Archives of British Honduras, of which the late Sir John Alder Burdon was Editor, and he compiled the booklets "Blazing Trails in British Honduras", "Shoulder to Shoulder" and the Standing Rules and Orders of the Orange Walk District Board, 1924.
TRAVELS
His travels took him to Guatemala City, New Orleans, New York and London. His visit to the latter three cities was in 1925 when he studied various income tax systems through the courtesy of the Income Tax Officials of those cities. By means of illustrated lectures, he brought the great Wembley Exhibition from England to the CUs Theatres in Belize and was supported by the late Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Dr. James Cran OBE and Mr. F.R. Dragten OBE, KC.
At the Shipmates Club at Stann Creek and at the Eureka Band Concert at the Park, Capt. Metzgen addressed the people of the District he had served so faithfully since September, 1935. He thanked them sincerely for the loyal cooperation he received from them during his administration and for their prayers and attention during his recent illness. In this connection he said that one of the things that will always linger in his memory is an act three Carib women - all unknown to him - who travelled from Stann Creek to Belize just to see him in the Hospital where they knelt at his bedside and prayed for his recovery. He had hoped to inaugurate a five year plan for Stann Creek with the one determined aim of laying a sound economic foundation for that deserving District. He hoped Stann Creek would get a District Commissioner who will serve her better than he did and he promised that during his retirement he will be ready and willing to serve the District and the colony in any way he can.
Sporting legacy.
In 1928, on a bicycle ride in the country on the Northern Highway, Monrad Metzgen conceived the idea of what became the first Cross Country Cycling Classic having been struck by the number of bicycles Belizeans used to attend weekly cricket games in rural areas. He developed the idea for a cycling "expedition" to San Ignacio in order to test the cyclists' ability to cope with a then-badly built Western Highway. The Governor immediately pledged support and offered a cup as a prize to the winner of the race — a race that continues annually to this day. He enlisted the support of such notables at Matron L.M. Roberts of the Public Hospital, Royal Bank of Canada local manager Charles Beattie, Frans Dragten, Reverend Cleghorn, medical officer Lieutenant Colonel James Cran and that of a young surveyor, Henry Fairweather. Within a month he had the whole programme together and launched.
On 2 April 1928, a parade and inspection of the cyclists was organised by Monrad Metzgen and attended by the Governor, Superintendent of Police and others, who congratulated the cyclists and sent them on a parade through the town's streets. The official race kicked off on 5 April 1928 from in front of the courthouse at 5:00 AM. The trail was along the Western Highway to San Ignacio (55 miles from Belize City). The first rider into Cayo (90 miles in total), Elston Kerr, was cheered for making it into town in about 13 hours. The men stayed through the Easter holidays, feasting, eating, playing cricket and soaking up the accolades of the Cayo faithful. They also visited Benque Viejo and San Jose Succotz, the westernmost settled areas in Cayo. On 9 April, the expeditionists set off at 5:00 AM to return to the City, their progress reliably reported through of all things, the telephone service. Kerr, of Burrell Boom, finished first in 21 hours 29 minutes, 81 minutes ahead of second place Norris Wade, also of Boom. Race organizer Metzgen finished in 30 and a half hours.
Subsequent to the race, Monrad Metzgen formed and chaired the British Honduras Cyclists Association in June 1928. As a result of his experience in the race, he was a key proponent of improved public roads ensuring that successive Governors of the Colony became interested in road building.
Board positions.
Metzgen served on numerous Boards and Committees, including: Three terms on the Belize Town Board; the Belize Electricity Board; Chairman of the St. George’s Caye Day Celebrations Committee; Secretary of the Welcoming Committee when Colonel Charles Lindbergh flew into Belize in 1927; Secretary of a committee to promote the building of a really first class hotel for the town; President of the Native Jockey Club; and President of the Eureka Band.
He belonged to the Belize Literary and Debating Society and gave speeches and wrote papers on the value of educating the masses, including campaigning for a Public Library in Town.
Bibliography.
In 1925, with H. E. C. Cain, he wrote “The Handbook of British Honduras”. The book includes over fifty Creole proverbs, proverbs like, Cuss-cus neber bore hole & Dawg hab liberty fi watch gubnor.
In 1928 he wrote “Blazing Trails in British Honduras” about the first Cross-Country race. (The book was recently reprinted by the Belize Historical Society).
In the late 1920s he worked on the “Archives of British Honduras”, edited by the Governor, Sir John Burdon and compiled the great patriotic pamphlet "Shoulder to Shoulder or The Battle of St. George's Caye."
The Handbook of British Honduras, by Monrad Metzgen and H.E.C. Cain, the Brief Sketch of British Honduras, by John Burdon, former governor and the Book Shoulder to Shoulder by Monrad Metzgen, all talk about the wonderful exploits of the Baymen. These are all out of print and have been officially suppressed in favour of new revisionist history-making.

Franz Peter Knoodt

Franz Peter Knoodt (November 6, 1811 – January 27, 1889) was a German Catholic theologian who was a native of Boppard.
He studied theology in Bonn und Tübingen, and later worked as a chaplain and teacher in Trier. In 1841-43 he furthered his studies in Vienna, where he was a student of Anton Günther (1783-1863). In 1844 he earned his doctorate of theology at Breslau, and in 1845 became a professor of philosophy at the Catholic faculty of theology at the University of Bonn.
Knoodt was an ardent follower of the philosophical teachings of Anton Günther, and several years after Günther's death, he published the biographical "Anton Günther. Eine Biographie" (1881, 2 volumes). This work has been praised as an important source of Catholic church history. Another noted work of Knoodt's was "Günther und Clemens; Offene Briefe" (Günther and Franz Jakob Clemens; Open Letters). Both publications were placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books) by the Roman Catholic Church.

Whaling in New Zealand

Whaling in New Zealand dates back to the late 18th century, and ended in 1964 since it was no longer economic. Nineteenth century whaling was based on the southern right whale, and 20th century whaling on the humpback whale. There is now an established industry for whale watching based in the South Island town of Kaikoura.
History.
The Māori, who were the first to settle in New Zealand, appear to have hunted whales rarely, but did eat stranded whales.
The earliest association of whaling with New Zealand is from December 1791, when the whaleship "William and Ann" called in at Doubtless Bay during a whaling voyage of the Pacific. It is not recorded if any whales were actually caught in what are New Zealand waters. The "Britannia" arrived about the same time. Both were whalers that had dropped convicts at Sydney. In the early 18th century, Kororareka (now called Russell) was a supply port for whaling and sealing ships, and developed a wild reputation being called the "Hellhole of the Pacific" by Charles Darwin who did not like his time in New Zealand. Other early whaling ships were the "Foxhound", a London whaler, in 1827 and the "Waterloo", which operated between Cloudy Bay and Sydney from 1829, taking 3 cargoes per year and returning with supplies and trade goods to exchange for flax. 
By the 1830s most whaling, apart from American ships, was done from shore bases with mixed crews of Maori and European sailors. 
In the first half of the 19th century, almost a hundred small shore stations were established - in the South Island at Te Awaiti and Preservation Inlet and later at Stewart Island, Otago, Timaru and Kaikoura and Cloudy Bay. On Banks Peninsula the first shore was at Little Port Cooper in 1836 and by 1842 there were a total of five stations,including Oashore Bay, Ikoraki and Peraki. North of Wellington, there were three whaling stations at Porirua, and five on Kapiti Island. Further north there were also shore stations at New Plymouth and Great Barrier Island. However, by 1840 the whale numbers had declined to the point that little money was to be made, and in 1844 the last of the early onshore stations closed.
A later shore station, Perano's of Tory Channel, Cook Strait caught 4200 whales (mainly humpback) between 1911 and 1964, when the last whale was caught in New Zealand waters.
Conservation.
Since 1978, whales within New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone have been protected under the Marine Mammals Protection Act 1978. Killing a whale or other cetacean is punishable by up to six months imprisonment, or a fine of up to NZ$250,000. Efforts are now often made to save whales that have stranded or have become entangled in marine debris.
There is a vocal antiwhaling sentiment in New Zealand. The Government regularly attends the International Whaling Commission meetings and supports the moratorium on whaling, as well as advocating for the creation of whale sanctuaries.
In 2010, Peter Bethune, an antiwhaling activist, was detained by Japanese whalers when he boarded a whaling ship in the southern oceans. He was convicted in Japan and deported back to New Zealand.

Malta Memorial

The Malta Memorial is a commemorative war memorial monument to the 2,298 Commonwealth aircrew who lost their lives in the various Second World War air battles and engagements around the Mediterranean, and who have no known grave.
After the war ended, and with its pivotal contribution to the air war in the Mediterranean, Malta was the chosen location of the memorial. Built on land generously donated by the Government of Malta, it is located in the area of Floriana, to the south side of the Triton Fountain close to City Gate, the entrance to Malta's capital city, Valletta.
The Malta Memorial is identified by the gilded bronze Golden Eagle which surmounts the column of Travertine marble, from Trivoli in the Sabine Hills near Rome. It is carved with a light netted pattern and surmounted by a gilded bronze eagle high. The column stands on a circular base around which the names are inscribed on bronze panels. At the base of the column itself, a bronze panel bears the following inscription:
The Latin epigram may be rendered in English: AN ISLAND RESOLUTE OF PURPOSE REMEMBERS RESOLUTE MEN.

LMS 2 and 2A boilered 4-6-0 locomotives

The London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) 2 and 2A boilered 4-6-0 locomotives were express passenger 4-6-0 steam locomotives. In 1935 W.A. Stanier, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the LMS, ordered the rebuilding of the unique experimental high pressure compound locomotive 6399 "Fury". The Schmidt-Henschel boiler was replaced with a tapered boiler, with a drumhead smokebox, designated type 2. The type 2 boiler had a tube surface of 1669 square feet, formed by tubes 2⅛ inches in diameter and 14' 3" long. It was fitted with a 28 row superheater with 360 square feet of heating surface. The superheater elements, 1⅛ inch in diameter, were fitted into flue tubes 5⅛ inches diameter. On test the boiler performed poorly, heat transfer to the water being inadequate because the hot gases from the firebox passed too rapidly through the tubes to the smokebox. The rapid passage of gas was indicated by too high a temperature in the smokebox, and the choking of the smokebox by excessive char carried through from the firebox. The boiler was re-tubed with 180 smaller tubes 1⅞ inches diameter, and with superheater elements 1¼ inch diameter. The single blastpipe was replaced with a double blastpipe and chimney to provide adequate gas velocity in the smokebox. This, combined with the increased rate of evaporation provided by the re-tubing, improved the performance of the boiler substantially. 
The performance of Stanier's Jubilee Class also suffered from incorrect boiler proportions. In 1935 a design for an improved taper boiler was schemed out; this was 13 feet long, with 198 tubes 1¾ inches in diameter. In 1943 Stanier instructed Coleman, the chief designer at Derby, to rebuild two of the Jubilee class with boilers to this design. This type of boiler was designated type 2A. Combined with modifications to the steam ports and valve gear, the rebuilding produced locomotives that were more powerful and economical than either the original Jubilees or the Royal Scots.
As the boilers of the Royal Scots were due for replacement, and their built-up smokeboxes were proving difficult to keep airtight, the decision was taken to rebuild the class in batches. They were also fitted with type 2A boilers. Rebuilding started in 1943, and eventually all 70 members of the class were rebuilt.
From 1946, 18 of the 52-strong Patriot Class (which shared the shame chassis as the Royal Scots) also received 2A boilers. 
A total of 91 locomotives were rebuilt. Dates of building and numbers of engines are given in the following table.
Withdrawal.
All 91 locomotives were withdrawn from stock between 1961 and 1965.

One for Sorrow (novel)

One for Sorrow is a coming-of-age novel by the American writer Christopher Barzak.In 2014 it was adapted into the feature film "Jamie Marks is Dead" and debuted at the Sundance Film Festival.Directed by Carter Smith, the film's actors include Liv Tyler, Judy Greer, Cameron Monaghan, Morgan Saylor, Noah Silver, and Madisen Beaty.
It tells the story of Adam McCormick, age fifteen, and his relationship to Jamie Marks, a boy found murdered in the woods, but does not follow the traditional suspense or mystery novel's convention of tracking down the murderer. Instead, the book explores the nature of relationships between young adults and their families, communities (a somewhat hard-scrabble rural working class small town outside of Youngstown, Ohio), and the search for hope or redemption.
The novel makes use of fantastical elements (in this case, ghosts) situated in a mostly realistic, recognizable setting.
"One for Sorrow" won the Crawford Award for Best First Fantasy in 2008. It was also nominated for the Great Lakes Book Award, The Logo Channel's New Now Next Award, and The Locus Award for Best First Novel. The novel was praised as "lovely, melancholy, offbeat" in a Village Voice review of 2007.
The Washington Post called "One for Sorrow" a "remarkable first novel."
Barzak's second novel, "The Love We Share without Knowing", also released by Bantam, is due to be released November 25, 2008.

Horsforth Woodside railway station

Horsforth Woodside is a proposed railway station to be built on the site of Woodside Quarry near Horsforth in West Yorkshire, England. It would be located on the Harrogate Line near the extant Horsforth station which would also stay open. Horsforth Woodside was a very early station on the Leeds-Nothallerton railway, but was closed completely in 1864. The fact that both this old closed station and the proposed new station share the same name is a matter known to cause confusion when railway historical matters in this area are being discussed. The proposed station would serve a proposed housing development at the former Woodside Quarry as well as providing a park and ride service in to Leeds city centre.
Timetable constraints mean that it is unlikely the station would be open until 2014. A turn-back facility is proposed for Horsforth station, which if approved would be available in 2012 and so construction of this station can take place.

Tomás Cloma

Tomás Cloma (18 September 1904 – 18 September 1996) was a Filipino lawyer and businessman from the province of Bohol. Cloma was born in Panglao to Ciriaco Cloma, a Spanish settler, and Irena Arbolente, a native of Bohol.
He is best known for establishing the micronation of Freedomland in the Spratly Islands.
Free Territory of Freedomland.
In 1947, Cloma, a Filipino adventurer and a fishing magnate, found several unoccupied groups of islands in the South China Sea. This forms part of the justification of territorial claims by the Philippines of the Spratly islands (along with doctrines from the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea). 
Cloma, owner of a fishing fleet and a private maritime training institute, the PMI Colleges (formerly known as Philippine Maritime Institute), aspired to open a cannery and develop guano deposits in the Spratlys. It was principally for economic reasons, therefore, that he "discovered" and claimed islands in the Spratlys.
On May 11, 1956, together with 40 men, Cloma took formal possession of the islands, lying some west of the southern end of Palawan and named them "Freedomland". Four days later, on May 15, 1956, Cloma issued and posted copies of his "Notice to the Whole World" on each of the islands as a manifestation of unwavering claims over the territory. On May 31, 1956, Cloma declared the establishment of the "Free Territory of Freedomland", ten days after he sent his second representation to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs informing the latter that the territory claimed was named "Freedomland". On July 6, 1956, Cloma declared to the whole world his claim and the establishment of a separate government with its capital on Flat Island (also known as Patag Island). Cloma introduced a distinction between his "Freedomland" and the Spratlys further west. This distinction later became part of the Philippines' foreign policy. This distinction was never fully clarified. It seems that Freedomland encompasses most of what others call the Spratly Islands, but not Spratly Island itself, nor the banks and reefs lying to the west of it.
Cloma's declaration was met with hostile reactions from several neighboring countries, especially the Republic of China, or Taiwan. On September 24, 1956 the ROC reoccupied nearby Itu Aba Island (also known as "Taiping Island"), which it had abandoned in 1950, and intercepted Cloma’s men and vessels found within its immediate waters. The People's Republic of China, or Mainland China, also restated its own claim.
In the 1970s, after being jailed by Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos for being popularly called "Admiral," Cloma "ceded" his claim to the Philippine government for one peso.
According to a website set up by the "Kingdom of Colonia St John", Freedomland apparently became known as "The Kingdom of Colonia St John" under "His Majesty John I King of Colonia St John" and "Prince of Mariveles and Amboyna" to whom the succession passed from Admiral Tomas Cloma.
The Free Territory of Freedomland should not be confused with the Principality of Freedomland or the Republic of Koneuwe which was set up by a French swindler also in the Spratlys but not on the same islands.

New York State Route 285

New York State Route 285 (NY 285) was a state highway in Oneida County, New York, in the United States. The southern terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 69 west of the hamlet of Taberg in the town of Annsville. Its northern terminus was in the community of Thompson Corners, where it ended at a junction with County Route 67A (CR 67A) and CR 70. NY 285 was little more than a connector between NY 69 and Thompson Corners, as it did not pass through any other areas of interest.
NY 285 initially extended from Taberg to the hamlet of Florence when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It was truncated to Thompson Corners , but extended slightly in the 1960s when NY 69 was realigned to bypass Taberg. Ownership and maintenance of NY 285 was transferred to Oneida County on September 1, 1988, and the NY 285 designation was removed just over two months later. The route is now County Route 70A.
Route description.
NY 285 began at an intersection with NY 69 southwest of the hamlet of Taberg in the town of Annsville. The route headed northward, intersecting with Main Street, which connected NY 285 to Taberg. Here, NY 285 turned to the northwest and became Taberg–Florence Road. Just outside Taberg, the route passed Saint Patrick's Cemetery, as well as the remains of an old Protestant cemetery situated directly across NY 285 from it. As it continued northwestward through a rural portion of Oneida County, NY 285 passed a junkyard near the intersection with Pond Hill Road. Past an intersection with Carlisle Road, NY 285 entered a state reforestation area. As such, the surrounding landscape became mostly forested areas. Near the center of the reforestation area, the highway intersected with Skinner Settlement Road (CR 85). After passing over Corkin Hill, NY 285 headed downhill into the town of Florence.
After crossing into Florence, NY 285 remained in the reforestation area, and continued towards Thompson Corners on a linear, northwesterly routing. It passed Greely Cemetery, then continued to Thompson Corners, a very small community in southeastern Florence. NY 285 terminated here at an intersection with Empeyville Road (CR 67A) and Wolcott Hill Road (CR 70). CR 70 turned northwest at this junction to follow NY 285's right-of-way to the hamlet of Florence and eventually to the Oneida County line.
History.
NY 285 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a highway connecting NY 69 (Main Street) in Taberg to the isolated hamlet of Florence in the town of the same name via Thompson Corners. The route was truncated southeastward to Thompson Corners . In the early 1960s, NY 69 was rerouted to follow a new purpose-built highway that bypassed most of Taberg to the south. Most of NY 69's original alignment through the hamlet was transferred to the town of Annsville; however, its former western approach into Taberg along Taberg Road was realigned to meet the bypass and became a short extension of NY 285.
On September 1, 1988, ownership and maintenance of NY 285 was transferred from the state of New York to Oneida County. The portion of the exchange relating to NY 285 was described in New York State Highway Law as follows, with annotations in brackets:
In return, the state of New York assumed maintenance over a portion of River Street (CR 32) that connected NY 69 in Oriskany to NY 49 in Marcy. This highway became NY 922E, an unsigned reference route. Meanwhile, the NY 285 designation remained in place until November 4, 1988, when it was officially removed from the highway. The former routing of NY 285 became CR 70A, a spur of the pre-existing CR 70.

Sam Lotu-Iiga

Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga (born 2 November 1970) is the member of the New Zealand Parliament for the Maungakiekie electorate having been elected in the 2008 election. Lotu-Iiga is one of two National Party Pacific Island MPs. Lotu-Iiga holds the Samoan high chiefly title of Peseta.
Early life.
Lotu-Iiga was born in Apia, Samoa, and moved to New Zealand as a child. He grew up in South Auckland, attending Mangere Central Primary School. He then attended Auckland Grammar School and the University of Auckland, where he earned an MCom(Hons) and a BCom/LLB.
While studying, Lotu-Iiga worked as an intern at the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but declined an offer to continue after graduation, instead joining Russell McVeagh McKenzie Bartleet in Auckland as a solicitor.
Lotu-Iiga travelled to Britain, where he worked for Bankers Trust as a financial analyst. While in Britain he earned his MBA from Cambridge University (Queens College). While at Cambridge Lotu-Iiga played rugby for the New Zealand Barbarians.
Lotu-Iiga moved to Sydney and became an executive consultant with Macquarie Bank.
Political career.
Lotu-Iiga stood on the Citizens & Ratepayers' ticket for a seat on the Auckland City Council in October 2007, in the Tamaki-Maungakiekie ward. In a surprise win, Lotu-Iiga became the first right-wing councillor for the area in twelve years. Aligned with Mayor John Banks, Lotu-Iiga was appointed Chairman of the City Development Committee on the Council.
In February 2008, Lotu-Iiga put his name forward for the National Party selection for the Maungakiekie electorate. That month, incumbent Labour Party MP Mark Gosche, who held a majority of over 6,000 votes, announced he would stand down from the seat that election. In April Lotu-Iiga defeated two other National Party nominees for the selection on the first ballot.
While the electoral boundaries for the area had changed, removing Otahuhu, the new boundary included the new suburbs of Panmure and Point England, which were considered to heavily favour the Labour Party. Gosche's large majority meant that Maungakiekie was still considered a safe Labour seat.
Lotu-Iiga ran a high-profile campaign, capitalising on his high name recognition as a City Councillor, and heavily engaged in grass-roots campaigning, including door-knocking the electoral district. On election night, Lotu-Iiga beat Labour List MP Carol Beaumont by a margin of 1,942 votes in what was one of the largest electoral swings in the country. Lotu-Iiga became one of three National Party candidates in the Auckland region to claim a seat from Labour, along with Nikki Kaye in and Paula Bennett in Waitakere. In his first term, Lotu-Iiga was the Deputy-Chairperson of the Commerce Committee and member of the Finance and Expenditure Committee.
Lotu-Iiga faced some significant criticism for not resigning from his role as an Auckland City Councillor when he was elected as an MP. He missed a significant number of meetings during this time which made important decisions with regards to areas within the Tamaki-Maungakiekie Ward. He eventually resigned his council post in October 2009.
In November 2011, Lotu-Iiga was reelected the MP for Maungakiekie, beating Carol Beaumont a second time with an increased majority. Following the election, Lotu-Iiga was elected Chairperson of the Social Services Select Committee, where he has presided over the Government's welfare reform legislation.
Personal life.
Lotu-Iiga lives with his wife Jules in Onehunga. He is on the board of One Tree Hill College (formerly Penrose High School).

Evander Berry Wall

Evander Berry Wall (1860 – May 13, 1940) was a New York socialite and later an American expatriate in France during the Belle Époque and beyond. He was famous for his extravagantly refined look and was crowned "King of the Dudes" in the 1880s.
A Young Prince Prodigal.
Evander was the son of Charles Wall and Elizabeth A. Wall. His siblings were James R. Wall and Louise Berry Wall Ladew (Mrs. Edward R. Ladew).
Evander was raised as a wealthy New Yorker. At the age of 16, he owned his first race horse. He inherited $2 million before the age of 22. Wall became a leader of the American Café society, a group of rich socialites.
Wall was a clotheshorse. He generally wore a "very extraordinary costume" such as the one pictured on the right: "a dust coat of a reddish havana brown, a suit made of a large grey shepherd plaid check; extremely wide trousers tapered at the ankle, and turned up several inches to display white spats and highly varnished shoes; a 'startling' striped shirt in red and sky blue, with very high false collar of a pattern different from the shirts, a striped vest and a widely spread stock-cravat." He was popularly credited with the possession of over 500 trousers and 5,000 neckties.
King of the Dudes.
Wall was first proclaimed "King of the Dudes" at the resort town of Long Branch, New Jersey in the summer of 1883.
Wall was again proclaimed "King of the Dudes" in 1888 by the "New York American" newspaper. A journalist named Blakely Hall judged that Wall had won the "Battle of the Dudes" against Robert "Bob" Hilliard, another sartorial dude when, during the March Blizzard of 1888, he strode into a bar clad in gleaming boots of patent leather that went to his hips. Nevertheless, some historians still consider it was Hilliard who won that dude battle.
Wall won another fashion contest in August 1888, in Saratoga Springs, New York. To win a bet against John "Bet a Million" Gates, Wall changed clothes 40 times between breakfast and dinner. He appeared on the race track "in one flashy ensemble after the other until, exhausted but victorious he at last entered the ballroom of the United States Hotel in faultless evening attire."
Ever the fashion-leader, Wall is credited for having been the first person in the United States to wear a dinner jacket (tuxedo) to a ball. The white ensemble had been sent to him by the London Savile Row tailor Henry Poole & Co "to be worn for a quiet dinner at home or at an evening's entertainment at a summer resort." This was a time when tailcoat was still the rule, and Wall was immediately ordered off the floor.
Wall's financial life was not as successful as his fashion life. An ill-conceived stock-broking career and additional failures as a stable owner ended in an 1899 bankruptcy. Wall finally declared that "New York had become fit only for businessmen" and left for Paris in 1912.
Parisian Grandeur.
Whether in Paris, Deauville, Biarritz, or Aix-les-Bains, Wall and his wife were famous members of the European social elite. Their social circle included the Duchess of Windsor, the Grand Duke Dimitri of Russia, the Aga Khan, and ex-king Nicholas of Montenegro (whom Wall called a "magnificent old darling").
They lived in a suite in the Hotel Meurice, with a consecutive string of chow dogs named Chi-Chi or Toi-Toi. This was located conveniently near the bespoke shirtmaker Charvet, where Wall had his signature "spread eagle" collar shirts and cravats custom-made for himself and his dog. Wall always dined at the Ritz with his dog, whose collars and ties were made by Charvet in the same style and fabric as his master's.
During World War I, the Walls stayed in France and put all their social connections to use. For their fundraising efforts on behalf of wounded servicemen, each of the Walls was awarded the French Legion of Honour medal.
Wall wrote his memoirs in his late seventies, and they were published after his death in 1940, his wife had died in 1936. In "Neither Pest Nor Puritan", Wall ascribed his longevity to the fact he never saw physicians and always drank champagne instead of water, claiming that "There are more old drunkards than there are old doctors." He noted that, "I keep reminding myself as I draw nearer my last great duty, the obligation upon me to thank the God I believe in for the gift of life."
When he died, he left only $12,608, having "squandered nearly every cent on pleasure."

Elisabeth Eidenbenz

Elizabeth Eidenbenz, (Wila, Switzerland, June 12, 1913 - Zurich, Switzerland, May 23, 2011) was a teacher and nurse and founder of the Mothers of Elne (also known as "Maternitat d'Elna" in Catalan, "Maternidad de Elna" in Spanish and "Maternité Suisse d'Elne" in French). Between 1939 and 1944 she saved some 600 children, mostly the children of Spanish Republicans, Jewish refugees and gypsies fleeing the Nazi invasion.
Biography.
Elisbeth was a young teacher from Switzerland, teaching in Switzerland and Denmark until she decided to join the "Asociación de Ayuda a los Niños en Guerra" ("Association to Aid Children in War"). 
After the fall of the Spanish Republic many Republican exiles sought refuge in France, including the Roussillon which is part of the called Northern Catalonia. Many died of malnutrition, disease and other afflictions. Many pregnant woman were destined to lose their unborn children, or worse, die in childbirth. Elisabeth had arrived in Madrid on April 24, 1937 as a volunteer as part of an aid team but had relocated to the South of France. Appalled by the situation of mothers and children amongst the refugees, Elizabeth decided to convert an abandoned mansion in Elne (adjacent to Argelès-sur-Mer) into a maternity home. 
The group initially relied on voluntary donations from Europe, but after the start of World War II, funds dried up while refugees began to arrive from France and the rest of Europe. These were mainly Jewish women fleeing the Nazi occupation. Therefore, the group was forced to associate themselves with the Red Cross, and to abide by the policy of "neutrality". This would have prevented them from sheltering political refugees, mostly Jews. It was therefore decided that the identity of most of the refugees would be hidden in order to circumvent these laws. They were harassed by the Gestapo and on one occasion detained. Some 400 Spanish children and 200 Jews from Europe were save throughout this period. 
She later in life retired Rekawinkel, 30 km from Vienna (Austria) and since 2009 in Zurich. From 2002, her work began to be gain recognition with the publication of several books on her life and a reunion just before Easter 2002 when 60 of the survivors she helped save reunited in Elne to honour "La Señorita".

Francisco Mateo

Francisco "Paco" Mateo (15 May 1917 in Algeciras - 21 July 1979 in Strasbourg) was a Spanish-French footballer who played as a professional for Valencia, Bordeaux and Strasbourg. He also was a coach and manager for RC Strasbourg.
Bio.
Mateo started his career as a promising youngster playing for a Spanish club in Tétouan, Morocco and quickly attracted the attention of the biggest clubs in the Spanish mainland, joining Sevilla FC and then FC Barcelona before the outbreak of the Spanish civil war. Mateo chose the Republican side, spending most of the war in Valencia. Towards the end of the conflict, he was imprisoned due to his political leanings but was released on the insistence of the Girondins de Bordeaux and was therefore able to emigrate to France shortly before the outbreak of World War II.
In Bordeaux, Mateo played for the Girondins in a local league as the French Championship had been disbanded due to the war. He also met his wife, an Alsatian who had been evacuated to south-west France in 1939. When the war was terminated, he accompanied his wife back to Alsace and quickly joined RC Strasbourg where he plained until the end of the decade, reaching the final of the cup in 1947.
After the end of his playing career, Mateo continued as a youth coach for RC Strasbourg where he taught the likes of Gilbert Gress, Gérard Hausser, Albert Gemmrich or Léonard Specht. He was responsible for the first team between October 1970 and June 1971 but was not able to save Strasbourg from relegation. He died in 1979, shortly after Strasbourg's first and only championship crown.

Georgian parliamentary election, 1990

Parliamentary elections were held in the Georgian SSR on 28 October 1990, with a second round on 11 November. They were the first free parliamentary election in since 1919, and saw Round Table-Free Georgia emerge as the largest party in Parliament, with 155 of the 250 seats. Voter turnout was 69.9%.
Round Table-Free Georgia MP Zviad Gamsakhurdia was elected by the Congress as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on 14 November, effectively the leader of Georgia.
The elected parliament was responsible for some of the most important decisions in the modern Georgian history, such as the declaration of independence from the Soviet Union, the adoption of the first Constitution of the Republic of Georgia, as well as the revocation of South Ossetian autonomy and the subsequent prosecution of the war in South Ossetia.
It was the first and only free election to the Congress of Soviets of Georgian SSR. The Congress ceased functioning after the coup d'état of 6 January 1992 and some of its members took part in the subsequent civil war. The Parliament of Georgia was re-instituted in March 1992 as the "State Council" and the fresh elections were held on 4 August of the same year.

Fabrik Inc.

Fabrik Inc. is a manufacturer of external hard drives and digital content management software and services. Fabrik said it was the third largest supplier of external storage products in North America in 2007. It is headquartered in San Mateo, with offices in Santa Ana and Culver City, California.
The company sells external hard drives and online backup software in a bundled product for consumers, small business users and audio/video (A/V) content creation professionals. The company also hosts the free online digital content management and sharing site, Joggle.
Fabrik’s product lines include SimpleTech, G-Technology, Joggle and Fabrik Ultimate Backup.
History.
Fabrik was founded as a Web-based software company in August 2005 by former Maxtor executives Mike Cordano and Keyur Patel. Anaal Udaybabu designed a brand identity for on-the-web storage. The following month, the company disclosed the completion of its series A funding of $4.1 million followed by $8 million in series B funding in July 2006 and $14.3 million in February 2007. Then in May 2007, the company received $24.9 million in funding, bringing the total to about $51.3 million in funding. 
In February 2006, Fabrik partnered with Maxtor (acquired by Seagate in 2005) to develop Maxtor Fusion, a network-attached storage (NAS) device built for organizing and sharing digital files, and in late 2006 the company launched myfabrik.com, which organized and stored digital media online.
In February 2007, the company acquired the consumer business of SimpleTech, inheriting the SimpleTech product line of external hard drives for consumers and small businesses. 
In January 2008, Fabrik acquired G-Technology and inherited a suite of external hard drives for Mac, creative pro, photography and A/V markets, including FireWire eSATA, USB, SCSI and Fibre Channel storage products.
Fabrik’s acquisitions and the introduction of Joggle at the DEMO conference in January 2008 created four brands: SimpleTech, G-Technology, Joggle and Fabrik Ultimate Backup. SimpleTech and G-Technology products were still branded as such and maintained separate online website entities.
On February 23, 2009, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies announced it agreed to acquire Fabrik. At this point Fabrik revenue for the year (2009) was estimated at $350M to $400M range and growing 40% on yearly basis.
On April 6, 2009, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies completed the acquisition, which formed the core of Hitachi GST's new Branded Business division.
Following the acquisition, the subsidiary was branded 'G-Technology by Hitachi'.
Products and services.
The company’s SimpleTech products are external hard drives for mainstream consumers and small business users. It includes portable external hard drives and desktop external hard drives. All SimpleTech products come bundled with free local backup software and online backup capabilities.
The SimpleTech has a 100 percent recyclable enclosure and several energy and resource efficiency features. The company claims the is the world’s most eco-friendly, resource conscious external hard drive. The original design of the SimpleTech portable external storage product line was inspired by the Ferrari design team Pininfarina. 
Fabrik started a free online digital content management site called Joggle in early 2008. The Web site searches for video, photos and music on a user’s computer, external hard drive or online communities and networking sites and automatically consolidates it into a single online organizing and sharing tool.
The company also has a pure online backup approach, Fabrik Ultimate Backup, where data can be backed up to remote servers using 128-bit SSL and Blowfish encryption.

Original Design.
The original shell, the M110 155mm projectile, was a hollow steel shell that typically contained about of Sulfur Mustard H or HD blister gas.
Design variants.
There are two design variants of the original M110 155mm shell that are used today; the A1 and A2 variants. Both variants are similar, although differ in some aspects. The A1 is primarily used for signaling and screening, while the A2 is used for screening and marking targets. The A2 weighs about , about of which is white phosphorus.

Polarizable continuum model

The polarizable continuum model (PCM) is a commonly used method in computational chemistry to model solvation effects. If it were necessary to consider each solvent molecule as a separate molecule, the computational cost of modeling a solvent-mediated chemical reaction would grow prohibitively high. Modeling the solvent as a polarizable continuum, and not as individual molecules, makes "ab initio" computation feasible. Two types of PCMs have been popularly used: dielectric PCM (D-PCM) which deals the continuum as a polarizable dielectrics and conductor-like PCM (C-PCM) which deals the continuum as a conductor-like picture similar to COSMO Solvation Model.
The molecular free energy of solvation is computed as the sum of three terms:
Charge-transfer effect is also considered as a part of solvation in cases.
The PCM solvation model is available for calculating energies and gradients at the Hartree–Fock and density functional theory (DFT) levels in several quantum chemical computational packages such as Gaussian, GAMESS and JDFTx.
The authors of a 2002 paper observe that PCM has limitations where non-electrostatic effects dominate the solute-solvent interactions. They write in the abstract: "Since only electrostatic solute-solvent interactions are included in the PCM, our results lead to the conclusion that, for the seven molecules studied, in cyclohexane, acetone, methanol, and acetonitrile electrostatic effects are dominant while in carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and chloroform other nonelectrostatic effects are more important."
There is an integral equation formalism (IEF) version of the PCM (ref. 4 in the 2002 paper).
PCM is also used to model outer solvation layers in multi-layered solvation approach.

Big Bird's Egg Catch.
"Big Bird's Egg Catch" (originally ""Grover's Egg Catch"") is a 1983 video game for the Atari 2600 developed by Atari and Children's Computer Workshop.
In "Big Bird's Egg Catch", the player controls Big Bird of Sesame Street fame as he saves eggs produced by chickens at the top of the screen. These eggs travel down variously contorted chutes to land safely in the basket perched on Big Bird's head. Most eggs count for a single point, but a golden egg will periodically appear that is worth five points. When an egg is dropped, a number of points are lost. At higher levels, the eggs move faster, the chutes become more convoluted, there are more egg-laying hens, and the chutes may even flash invisible. "Turkey in the Straw", the song that plays during the egg-catching, also increases in tempo.
Periodically, Big Bird will exit the screen to count his eggs. During this stage, Big Bird is seen with his basket and numbers flash on the screen progressively faster as he counts. When the total is reached, a song is played and Big Bird dances. The game ends when too many eggs are dropped or a set number of counting sessions is performed.
Cookie Monster Munch.
Cookie Monster Munch is a video game developed by Atari and Children's Computer Workshop for the Atari 2600 and released in 1983. The game was programmed by Gary Stark.
The objective of "Cookie Monster Munch" is to guide "Sesame Street"'s Cookie Monster through a simple maze, collecting cookies and placing them in a cookie jar at the bottom of the screen.

At some point in time, the game was released for the Unisys ICON operating system, a platform commissioned by the Ontario education system. No copies of this format exist, as the last ICON computers and software were destroyed in the early-2000s.
Ernie's Challenge level: "The Rubber Duck will be shown in one square some where on the screen. Ernie will be in another square somewhere else of the screen. The object is to get the Rubber Duck over to Ernie. You do this by selecting which path you’d like to use, from a wide selection, to get there. Ex. Say that there are 3 squares all together, starting from the left and going right. The Rubber Duck is in square #1 and Ernie is in square #3. Now, you want to go to square #3, which is to the right. So, select a panel that will get you there. Each panel will have to arrows in it, one representing where you’re leaving from, one representing where you’re going. We want to go the right, so select the panel with two arrows pointing to the right. Hey, look! You made it to Ernie! This is actually a lot simpler than it looks, so don’t worry too much. Once you’ve made it to Ernie, a little song and dance will take place. After words, pressing the A button will repeat the little show, but in reverse. Pressing Start will start a new game."
"Sesame Street 1-2-3" featured two different games: Astro-grover, and Ernie's magic shapes. In Ernie's magic shapes, you had to match the right symbol to a base symbol. Astro-grover was a simple math game. It was developed by Rare and published by Hi-Tech Expressions.

Rolls-Royce LiftSystem

The Rolls-Royce LiftSystem is an aircraft propulsion system designed for use in the STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II developed during the Joint Strike Fighter Program. The system was awarded the Collier Trophy in 2001.
Requirement.
The F-35B STOVL variant of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft is intended to replace the vertical flight Harrier, which was the world's first operational short-takeoff / vertical-landing fighter. A requirement of the JSF is that it can attain supersonic flight, and a suitable vertical lift system that would not compromise this capability was needed for the STOVL variant. The solution came in the form of the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem, developed through a $1.3 billion System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract from Pratt & Whitney. This requirement was met on 20 July 2001.
Design and development.
Instead of employing lift engines or rotating nozzles on the engine fan like the Harrier, the "LiftSystem" employs a shaft-driven LiftFan, designed by Lockheed Martin and developed by Rolls-Royce, and a thrust vectoring nozzle for the main engine exhaust that provides lift and can also withstand reheat in conventional flight to achieve supersonic speeds. The system has more similarities to the Russian Yakovlev Yak-141 and German EWR VJ 101D/E than the preceding generation of STOVL designs to which the Harrier belongs.
The entire team responsible for developing the propulsion system includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce, under the leadership of the United States Department of Defense Joint Strike Fighter Program Office. Paul Bevilaqua, Chief Engineer of Lockheed Martin Advanced Development Projects (Skunk Works) is credited as being responsible for the initial development of lift fan for the LiftSystem on the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter. The concept of a shaft-driven lift-fan does date back to the mid-1950s. The lift fan was demonstrated by the Allison Engine Company in 1995-97.
While the F-35B's primary powerplant is the Pratt & Whitney F135, specifically derived from the F119-PW-100, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) awarded General Electric and Rolls-Royce a $2.1 billion contract to jointly develop the F136 engine as an alternative, and the LiftSystem has been designed for interchangeability between the two engines. However, it is expected that a further $1.3 billion would be needed to complete the development of the F136 and there is some doubt about its future: the DOD proposals for terminating the F136 in its FY2007 and FY2008 budgets were rejected by Congress on both occasions, but DOD has again requested termination in its FY2009 budget proposal. 
Rolls-Royce is managing the overall development and integration programme from its site in Bristol, UK, which is also responsible for the LiftFan turbomachinery, 3BSM and Roll Post designs. The team in Indianapolis, US, will provide the system’s gearbox, clutch, driveshaft and nozzle and will conduct the build and verification testing of the LiftFan.
Operation.
The Rolls-Royce LiftSystem comprises four major components:
The configuration of the propulsion system is somewhat like a vertical ducted turboprop embedded into the center of the aircraft's fuselage. The three-bearing swivel module (3BSM) is a thrust vectoring nozzle at the tail of the aircraft which allows the main turbofan cruise engine exhaust to pass either straight through with reheat capability for forward propulsion in conventional flight, or to be deflected downward to provide aft vertical lift.
In "lift" mode for assisted vertical maneuvers, 28,000 hp is diverted forward through a driveshaft from the engine's low-pressure (LP) turbine via a clutch and bevel-gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating lift fan located forward of the main engine. The fan efflux (low-velocity unheated air) discharges through a thrust vectoring nozzle on the underside of the aircraft, thus balancing the aft lift generated by the 3BSM. Owing to the significant increase in LP turbine expansion ratio, implied by the large power off-take, the exhaust of the turbofan is switched from a mixed to unmixed configuration. For lateral stability and roll control, bypass air from the engine goes out through a pair of roll-post nozzles in the wings on either side of the fuselage. For pitch control, the areas of exhaust nozzle and LiftFan inlet are varied conversely to change the balance between them while maintaining their sum, and with constant turbine speed. Yaw control is achieved by yawing the 3BSM. Forward, and even backward, motion is controlled by tilting the 3BSM and LiftFan outlet.
The following indicates the component thrust values of the system in lift mode: 
In comparison, the maximum thrust of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus 11-61/F402-RR-408, the most powerful version of the Harrier's engine is .
Like lift engines, the added LiftSystem components are dead weight during flight, but the advantage of employing the LiftSystem is that its greater lifting power increases takeoff payload by an even larger amount. Also, the fan's cool efflux reduces the harmful effects of hot, high-velocity air which can harm runway pavement or an aircraft carrier deck.
Engineering challenges.
While developing the LiftSystem many engineering difficulties had to be overcome, and new technologies exploited. 
The LiftFan utilises hollow-bladed titanium blisks (a bladed disk or "blisk" achieved by super-plastic forming of the blades and linear friction welding to the blisk hub). Organic matrix composites are used for the interstage vanes. The LiftFan must safely function in a crosswind, which occurs at its intake when the aircraft transitions between forward flight and hover.
The clutch mechanism, which uses dry plate carbon–carbon technology originally derived from aircraft brakes, needs the ability to transfer without chatter or wear while ensuring high life. 
The gearbox has to be able to operate with interruptions to its oil supply of up to a minute while transferring full power through 90 degrees to the LiftFan.
The Three-Bearing Swivel Module has to both support the final hot thrust vectoring nozzle and transmit its thrust loads back to the engine mounts. A new word, "fueldraulics", was coined by the engineers to define the power system of the 3BSM's actuators, which uses fuel pressurised to 3,500 lbf/in2 rather than hydraulic fluid to reduce weight and complexity. One actuator travels with the swivel nozzle, moving through 95 degrees while subject to intense heat and vibration.
Testing.
During concept definition of the Joint Strike Fighter, two Lockheed airframes were flight-tested: the Lockheed X-35A (which was later converted into the X-35B), and the larger-winged X-35C, with the STOVL variant incorporating the Rolls-Royce LiftFan module. 
LiftSystem flight testing commenced in June 2001, and on 20 July that year the X-35B became the first aircraft in history to perform a short takeoff, a level supersonic dash and vertical landing in a single flight. By the time testing had been completed in August, the aircraft had achieved 17 vertical takeoffs, 14 short takeoffs, 27 vertical landings and five supersonic flights. During the final qualifying Joint Strike Fighter flight trials, the X-35B took off in less than , transitioned to supersonic flight, then landed vertically.
Ground tests of the F136/LiftSystem combination were carried out at the General Electric facility in Peebles, Ohio in July 2008. On 18 March 2010, a STOVL equipped F-35B performed a vertical hover and landing demonstration at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Lexington Park, MD.
Collier Trophy award.
In 2001, the LiftSystem propulsion system was awarded the prestigious Collier Trophy, in recognition of "the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in America", specifically for "improving the performance, efficiency and safety of air or space vehicles, the value of which has been thoroughly demonstrated by actual use during the preceding year."

<doc id="20172985" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20172985" title="Postpartisan">
Postpartisan

Post-partisanship is an approach to dispute resolution between political factions that emphasizes compromise and collaboration over political ideology and party discipline. It does not imply neutrality. From 2000-2007, there were virtually no online media references to the term "post-partisan". Media and Web references to the term are growing rapidly as the concept takes hold among policy-makers.The New York Times has attributed an oblique reference to post-partisan idealism in a statement by US President Thomas Jefferson, when he declared in his inaugural address in 1801: "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists."
Post-partisanship and the 2008 US Presidential election.
Often invoked by supporters of both 2008 US presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain, its modern renaissance dates back to a Los Angeles conference hosted June 18–19, 2007, by the USC Annenberg School for Communication, to "explore ways to improve political dialogue and decision making." 
William Safire, the late New York Times language maven, finds the first media reference to post-partisanship in a February 1976 article in the Times about a "disenchanted electorate" that preceded the Ford-Carter campaign: "It is within the fluid and independent middle," he quotes Christopher Lydon as saying, "that could shape new parties, realign the old ones or extend the history of erosion into a new 'post-partisan' era" (Safire 2008: 22).
Despite this journalistic heritage, it was at the Annenberg Conference in Los Angeles - titled Ceasefire! Bridging the Political Divide - that the concept of post-partisanship was studied, explained and celebrated by two modern politicians: Republican Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (a former Democrat, later re-elected as a Republican in 2005).
In a nutshell, according to entrepreneur and health policy researcher Neil Seeman, post-partisanship means involving all sides early in contemplating problems to complex policy issues - taking dialogue seriously and driving to the best solution that has maximum feasibility and impact.Mark Satin, editor of "Radical Middle Newsletter", an online journal, has articulated what he calls the 10 principles of post-partisanship (Satin 2007), as derived from the Los Angeles conference.
The 10 principles of post-partisanship.
Health innovation researcher Neil Seeman was the first to apply these principles to health policy decision-making, specifically to public health (Seeman, 2008). A former lawyer for the conservative-leaning National Citizen's Coalition of Canada (once headed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper) and former Fraser Institute research fellow, Mr. Seeman is a member of a growing number of policy thinkers who advocate for the application of post-partisanship to policy-making. Currently a Senior Resident at Massey College at the University of Toronto and an adjunct Professor of Health Services Management at Ryerson University, Mr. Seeman writes frequently on health system innovation and the application of Web 2.0 and social network analysis in health care ("Health 2.0"). He currently writes on health innovation for Canada's National Post and many peer-reviewed and other publications.
It is important to note that other observers dispute the very notion of post-partisanship. In a December 2008 New York Times article, Dan Mitchell, an economic analyst at the free-market Cato Institute, noted: "I don't think there is such a thing as post-partisan or post-ideological politics, but there is such a thing as one side being so shell-shocked and/or incompetent that it is incapable of presenting an alternative vision." 
In an October 2008 "open letter" to Canada's conservative Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, Seeman advises Harper to "try a post-partisan approach to public health policy." Seeman distinguishes between bipartisanship and postpartisanship. He writes: "Bipartisanship is horse-trading – in its best incarnation, this means crafting patchwork legislation that allows all sides to feel satisfied that some thread of their vision or ideological essence found its way into law. The process plays to ego, not good policy."
Post-partisan Decision Making.
Post-partisan decision-making, in advance of landing on any final policy proposal, allows multi-sector partners to select weighted solution criteria (a process formally referred to as multi-criteria decision analysis). The process enables a neutral, independent commission with assigned legislative power (comprising members nominated by all parties) to identify the cognitive and partisan biases that may have inadvertently crept into any final, recommended policy solutions. Pointing by way of example to California's success in constraining teenage pregnancy, Seeman writes:
"We have seen dividends come from such an approach in the arena of public health. Consider that Gov. Schwarzenegger’s state has witnessed a dramatic percentage decline in teen pregnancy rates. This is especially impressive since it occurred during mass migration to the state of sub-populations with very high teen pregnancy rates such as those seen outside of California.
California’s ambitious plan to curb teenage pregnancy – as with the governor’s new leadership in the battle against childhood obesity through mandated school physical activity- and healthy-lunch initiatives – would never have taken place but for Mr. Schwarzenegger’s continued openness to opposing viewpoints."

Central Huron Secondary School

Central Huron Secondary School ('CHSS') is a secondary school in Clinton, Ontario. The school opened in 1866. 
Although High School classes had been held in the Clinton Masonic Lodge as early as the mid-1850s, it was not until 1866 that Clinton High School was formally established. In 1877, the original Clinton High School building was erected. It was a Gothic structure with a centre block tower and mansard roof. The school was officially designated a Collegiate in 1885 because it offered courses in classical studies (Greek and Latin). A new building constructed in 1926 replaced the original yellow brick Gothic structure. The 1926 building was built in the Tudor style and is the oldest school building still in use as an educational institution in Huron County. The school was known as Clinton District Collegiate Institute until 1964, when the name was changed to Central Huron Secondary School. In 2002, it amalgamated with the former Seaforth District High School.

Hale was instrumental in cataloging the scientific specimens from the expedition that would later form the basis of the Natural History Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. He wrote several anthropological works on the Polynesian and Native North American peoples.
He married Margaret Pugh from Clinton, Ontario in 1855 and relocated there the following year. He was a founder and first Chair of the newly established Clinton Collegiate Institute in 1877.
He died in Clinton in 1896.

1991 Alabama Crimson Tide football team

The 1991 Alabama Crimson Tide football team represented the University of Alabama in the 1991 college football season. The team was led by head coach Gene Stallings who was in his second season at Alabama. The team played their home games at Bryant-Denny Stadium, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. The team competed in the Southeastern Conference.
The team improved upon a 7–5 record from Stallings's first season as they ended with a 11–1 overall record, while going 6–1 in their conference games. The September 21st win against Georgia would prove to be the first in a school record tying 28-game winning streak and a school record 31-game unbeaten streak.
Summary.
In the opener against Temple, Chris Anderson had a 96-yard touchdown run from scrimmage, setting an all-time team record that still stands. One week later, Alabama traveled to Florida and got blown out, 35–0. It was the worst Tide loss in 34 years, since a 40–0 loss in 1957 to Auburn that ended the disastrous coaching tenure of J.B. Whitworth. It also cost Alabama an SEC title as the Gators went undefeated in conference play. However, it would be the last game Alabama lost until November 1993, as the next week's 10–0 victory over Georgia began a 28-game winning streak.
After lopsided victories over Vanderbilt, Chattanooga, and Tulane, the Tide started winning a series of squeakers. Against Tennessee the Tide trailed 6–3 in the fourth quarter when starting QB Danny Woodson left the game with a strained hamstring. Behind backup Jay Barker, Alabama rallied for three touchdowns in the fourth quarter and won 24–19. It was the Crimson Tide's sixth victory in a row in the Third Saturday in October rivalry. Barker assumed the starting job when Woodson was suspended for violating team rules before the LSU game.
Late in the fourth quarter of the Mississippi State game, the Bulldogs drove down to the Alabama 1, but Stacy Harrison's end-zone interception preserved a 13–7 victory. Against LSU, David Palmer ran a punt back 90 yards for a touchdown and Antonio London blocked a field goal with 2:39 to go to preserve a 20–17 Alabama victory. Bama eked out a 10–7 victory over lowly Memphis State after the Memphis kicker missed two second-half field goals and Alabama end John Copeland forced a fumble by the Memphis QB at the Tide 27 with 3:51 to go. The season ended with Alabama's fifth straight victory by six points or less, as the Tide defeated Auburn in the Iron Bowl 13–6. Alabama faced off against Colorado in the Blockbuster Bowl and won another nailbiter 30–25 behind a punt return TD and 146 all-purpose yards from Palmer. Alabama's 11–1 record was its best since the 1979 team went 12–0 and won the national championship.

Olive wood carving in Palestine

Olive wood carving is an ancient tradition in Palestine that continues to the present day. It involves the skillful chiseling of olive wood and is most common in the Bethlehem region. 
History.
The tradition of making the handicrafts began in the 4th century CE under Byzantine rule in Bethlehem — which continues to be the main city that produces the craft — following the construction of the Church of the Nativity. Greek Orthodox monks taught local residents how to carve olive wood. The art developed and became a major industry in Bethlehem and nearby towns like Beit Sahour and Beit Jala in the 16th and 17th centuries when Italian and Franciscan artisans on pilgrimage to the area — by now under the rule of the Ottomans — taught the residents how to carve. Since then the tradition has been passed on generation by generation and is dominated by the descendants of the original local carvers. 
Today, the art continues to be a major source of income for Bethlehem's Palestinian Christian residents and is the most profitable tourist product in the city with the main purchasers being Christian pilgrims visiting in Christmas time. Olive wood is carved into crosses, boxes, picture frames, covers for historical and old books, candle holders, rosaries, urns, vases and Christmas ornaments as well as scenes of the Holy Family. Olive wood branches are supplied by olive groves in nearby villages as well as from the Nablus and Tulkarm region, despite the difficulty of transportation in the West Bank. 
Production process.
The process of producing an olive wood craft requires labor intensity and consists of many stages, often involving the work of multiple artisans. Drilling machines are used initially to attain the rough outline of the intended craft. It accounts for 15% of the process, although it eliminates some of the most difficult and time-consuming aspects of the carving. Next the piece is passed onto a skilled artisan who transforms the rough outline into a finished product by chiseling the details. Finally, the finished item must be sanded down and polished, then coated with olive wax to give the object a "natural shine" and ensure its longevity. Depending on what the particular product is, the process could take up to 45 days. Most professional artisans go through six to seven years of training.
Olive wood is used because it is easier to carve than other woods and could be done accurately with simple hand tools. Also, it has a diverse variety of natural color and tonal depth, due to the annual structure. It is also resistant to decay and receptive to a number of surfacing treatments.

Abdul Salaam Alizai

Mullah Abdul Salaam Alizai is a former member of the Taliban movement who defected to the Afghan government in December 2007. He is a leader of the Alizai, a Pashtun tribe.
In the 1980s, Mullah Abdul Salaam took part in the resistance against the Soviets. During the Taliban rule of Afghanistan, he was a military commander, and held the posts of governor of Orūzgān Province, and later district governor of Kajaki. He was said to be on good terms with Taliban leader Mullah Omar.
After the demise of the Taliban regime in 2001, Mullah Abdul Salaam returned to a civilian life, but was later imprisoned by the governor of Helmand province Sher Mohammed Akhundzada for eight months. The two men both belong to the Alizai tribe, but are from rival sub-tribes. Eventually, they reconciled, and Mullah Salaam served as head of Sher Mohammed's security detail, but the enmity between sub-tribes has not abated. Mullah Salaam later returned to his home town of Musa Qala to become a member of the local tribal council.
In mid-June 2006, as part of the Helmand province campaign, ISAF troops were deployed to Musa Qala, where they came under heavy attack by Taliban elements. In October 2006, both forces agreed to withdraw from the town, but in February 2007, the Taliban returned and seized control of Musa Qala. Mullah Salaam claimed that when the Taliban convened a Shura (council) to attack the ISAF, he refused to participate. However, during the Taliban takeover of February 2007, he is said to have led his tribal force in support of the Taliban. Later, he began negotiations with an Irish diplomat working for the European Union, who persuaded him to join the government. In the autumn of 2007, Mullah Salaam travelled to Kabul, where he met President Hamid Karzai and persuaded him that he could provoke a tribal uprising against the Taliban. Coalition and Afghan commanders then planned Operation Mar Kardad to recapture Musa Qala from the Taliban. The offensive began on 7 December 2007, but the tribal uprising promised by Mullah Salaam never occurred. However, once coalition troops had driven away the Taliban, he was appointed governor of Musa Qala District.
Having rallied to the government, he became a target for the Taliban. In January 2008, a suicide bomber injured several of his bodyguards.
After June 2008, his relations with the British appear to have significantly degraded. He accused British soldiers of undermining his authority by releasing people he had imprisoned and refusing to fund his "war chest", which he claims is for buying the support of Taliban commanders. In response, the British have accused him of concerning himself only with his own profit, and neglecting the reconstruction of Musa Qala. They have also charged that he has been taxing the illegal opium poppy crop, while his militia is said to have engaged in thievery and extortion. Mullah Salaam has denied the charges.
On January 1, 2009, Taliban militants attacked his house in the village of Shah Kariz, killing 20 of his bodyguards, but Salaam was absent at the time, and escaped injury.

Languages of Namibia

Namibia, despite its scarce population, is home to a wide diversity of languages, from multiple language families: Indo-European, Bantu, and the various Khoisan families. During apartheid Afrikaans, German and English held the position of official language; however, after independence from South Africa, Namibia's new government made English the sole official language in the constitution of Namibia. German and Afrikaans were stigmatised as having colonial overtones, while the rising of Mandela's Youth League and the 1951 Defiance Campaign spread English among the masses as the language of the liberation struggle.
Language demographics.
The most widely spoken languages are Oshiwambo dialects, by 48% of the population, the Khoekhoe language by 11%, Afrikaans by 11%, Kwangali language by 10% and Herero by 10%. Other native languages include the Bantu languages Tswana, Gciriku, Fwe, Kuhane, Mbukushu, Yeyi; and the Khoisan Naro, ǃXóõ, Kung-Ekoka, ǂKxʼauǁʼein and Kxoe. English, the official language, is spoken by less than 1% of people as their native language. Among the white population, 60% speak Afrikaans, 32% German, 7% English, and 1% Portuguese (current figures show that Portuguese speakers are in fact 4–5% of the total population of the country nowadays, i.e. 100,000 people).
Indigenous languages are included in the school syllabus at primary level. From secondary level English is the medium of instruction. Afrikaans is the only language that comes close to a lingua franca, and is spoken by most black townspeople together with English and their native language.

Hardy Plant Society

The Hardy Plant Society is a British charity that promotes the cultivation of hardy herbaceous plants. The Society was founded in 1957 by a group of gardeners and nurserymen. It has approximately 10,000 members and provides information about familiar and less well known perennials, how to grow them and where they may be obtained. The Society also works towards ensuring that all garden worthy perennial plants remain in cultivation and have the widest distribution. Its President is Roy Lancaster. 
Activities.
The Society aims to inform and encourage the novice gardener, stimulate and enlighten the more knowledgeable, and entertain and enthuse all gardeners bonded by a love for, and an interest in, hardy perennial plants. Throughout the year there is a wide range of events hosted by local group members, from plant study days to residential weekends to garden visits. The Society also organises overseas garden tours. The Society exhibits at major shows throughout the country to stimulate interest in hardy plants. Visitors can see hardy plants in bloom and leaf in their natural season and find out more about the work of the Society. An extensive library of slides covering a wide range of hardy plants is available to members on loan. Slides have been donated by photographers in the Society.
Conservation.
The Hardy Plant Society is concerned about the conservation of garden plants. Countless fine plants have totally disappeared from cultivation and remain but a memory. The Society is working towards ensuring that older, rarer and lesser-known perennial plants are conserved and made available to gardeners generally.
Seed distribution scheme.
Every member can join in the annual Seed Distribution Scheme by obtaining or donating hardy perennial seed. The Seed List offers over 2,500 varieties of rare, unusual and familiar seeds and is sent to every member in December. 
Membership.
National membership of the Society gives members the opportunity to join a local group and take part in a range of activities. There are around 40 local groups across the UK and national members are invited to join the group nearest to them. Each group offers a range of gardening activities including lectures from gardening speakers, garden visits, plant sales and educational and social events throughout the year. Most groups produce their own newsletters.
Within the Society there are specialist groups that members can join. They produce their own newsletters and organise meetings and events for fellow enthusiasts. The Correspondents Group ensures that members who are unable to attend meetings can remain in touch with one another and exchange gardening ideas and information.
The Hardy Plant Society produces a twice-yearly journal, "The Hardy Plant", with contributions from leading UK and international plant enthusiasts. It contains articles on hardy perennials and gardens as well as contributions from members. A newsletter is circulated three times a year that provides information on all the Society's events, activities, interests and group contacts. An annual leaflet lists the private gardens of members that can be visited and a register of lecturers.

Gnuspeech

Gnuspeech is an extensible text-to-speech computer software package that produces artificial speech output based on real-time articulatory speech synthesis by rules. That is, it converts text strings into phonetic descriptions, aided by a pronouncing dictionary, letter-to-sound rules, and rhythm and intonation models; transforms the phonetic descriptions into parameters for a low-level articulatory speech synthesizer; uses these to drive an articulatory model of the human vocal tract producing an output suitable for the normal sound output devices used by various computer operating systems; and does this at the same or faster rate than the speech is spoken for adult speech.
Design.
The synthesizer is a tube resonance, or waveguide, model that models the behavior of the real vocal tract directly, and reasonably accurately, unlike formant synthesizers that indirectly model the speech spectrum. The control problem is solved by using René Carré’s Distinctive Region Model which relates changes in the radii of eight longitudinal divisions of the vocal tract to corresponding changes in the three frequency formants in the speech spectrum that convey much of the information of speech. The regions are, in turn, based on work by the Stockholm Speech Technology Laboratory of the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) on "formant sensitivity analysis" - that is, how formant frequencies are affected by small changes in the radius of the vocal tract at various places along its length.
History.
Gnuspeech was originally commercial software produced by the now-defunct Trillium Sound Research for the NeXT computer as various grades of "TextToSpeech" kit. Trillium Sound Research was a technology transfer spin-off company formed at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, based on long-standing research in the computer science department on computer-human interaction using speech, where papers and manuals relevant to the system are maintained. The initial version in 1992 used a formant-based speech synthesiser. When NeXT ceased manufacturing hardware, the synthesizer software was completely re-written and also ported to NSFIP (NextStep For Intel Processors) using the waveguide approach to acoustic tube modeling based on the research at the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University, especially the Music Kit. The synthesis approach is explained in more detail in a paper presented to the American Voice I/O Society in 1995. The system used the onboard 56001 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) on the NeXT computer and a Turtle Beach add-on board with the same DSP on the NSFIP version to run the waveguide (also known as the tube model). Speed limitations meant that the shortest vocal tract length that could be used for speech in real time (that is, generated at the same or faster rate than it was "spoken") was around 15 centimeters, because the sample rate for the waveguide computations increases with decreasing vocal tract length. Faster processor speeds are progressively removing this restriction, an important advance for producing children's speech in real time.
Trillium ceased trading in the late 1990s and the Gnuspeech project was first entered into the GNU Savannah repository under the terms of the GNU General Public License in 2002, as an official GNU software.
Portability.
Various associated modules used to help in developing the original spoken English databases are being ported and they could be used for other languages. The whole software suite is suitable for psychoacoustic and linguistic research, but is currently only complete for the NeXT. A main module - "Monet" - is available for Mac OS X. Monet allows the creation and modification of the rules used to form and concatenate the speech sound parameters for different languages, with the exception of the rules used for intonation. However, the rule-based intonation can be manually varied.

The design of the name ship, "Leda" of 1800, was based on the Sané-designed "Hébé". "Hebe" was a French Hébé class frigate that the British 44-gun fifth rate HMS "Rainbow" captured in 1782. (The British took "Hébé" into service as HMS "Hebe" but in 1805 renamed her HMS "Blonde"). The class of frigates built to the lines of the "Leda" were in contemporary parlance called the 'Repeat "Leda" class'.
"Pomone", the first ship of the class, was built using Josiah Brindley's patent method of construction which dispensed with wooden 'lodging' and 'hanging knees', oak elements which had to be grown to shape, using instead iron fastenings and iron knees. Oak suitable for shipbuilding had become increasingly difficult to obtain through the long period of warfare.
Characteristics and performance.
The vessels of the class were fast, most recording 13kts large and 10kts close-hauled. However, their French-style proportions made them unweatherly compared to frigates designed to British proportions (such as the "Lively" class). Many captains requested additions to the false keel of these frigates to remedy this. The "Leda"-class stood to their canvas well and liked a stiff gale, but were prone to excessive pitching in very heavy seas. All captains complained of the class's poor stowage capacity, the result of their fine French underwater lines, but stowage improved after the introduction of iron fresh-water tanks. The class was also reckoned to be "wet", a result of a tendency to work their seams due to lively rolling and pitching.
Ships of the class.
The name "Leda" was taken from Greek mythology, as was common at the time; the Greek Leda was a woman whom Zeus seduced while he was masquerading as a swan. After "Leda", the Admiralty had no more ships to this design for several years. Then with the resumption of war with France either looming or under way, the Admiralty ordered eight further ships to this design in 1802-09:
In 1812 the Admiralty ordered eight ships to be built of "fir" (actually, of red pine) instead of oak; these were sometimes called the Cydnus class:
The Admiralty ordered seven more vessels to this design in 1812-15, with those constructed in Britain reverting to oak and those constructed in Bombay using teak:
The Admiralty ordered another six vessels in 1816, but of a modified design that incorporated Sir Robert Seppings's circular stern and "small-timber" form of construction:
A further twenty-three ships were ordered to this modified design in 1817, although the last six were never completed, or not completed to this design:
The last six ships of the 1817 orders were never completed to this design:

Rui Fonte

Rui Pedro da Rocha Fonte (born 23 April 1990) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for S.L. Benfica B as a forward or right winger.
Club career.
Fonte was born in Penafiel, and started his career at Sporting CP, joining the club's youth system at only seven. In 2006 he signed a three-year contract with Arsenal, with a clause stating he was to return to his previous club if the English side did not extend the contract beyond the original period.
A regular member of Arsenal's reserves, Fonte made his debut for the first team in a friendly against Barnet in the 2008 pre-season. He made his competitive debut for the Gunners as a substitute for Carlos Vela in a League Cup match against Wigan Athletic on 11 November 2008, a 3–0 home win.
On 30 January 2009 Fonte signed for Football League Championship side Crystal Palace on a one-month loan, with his older brother José playing a big role in persuading club and player of each other's merits. He made his club debut in a 0–1 home defeat against Blackpool on the following day, and his loan was subsequently extended until the end of the season; Palace were docked a point and fined £20,000 for fielding him in their final game, despite his loan having expired.
On 19 May 2009 it was announced that Arsenal had not decided to extend Fonte's three-year contract, and the player returned to Sporting. He spent the 2009–10 season on loan to Vitória de Setúbal, making his top division debut on 17 August in a 0–0 home draw against Vitória de Guimarães (one minute played), and appearing sparingly during the campaign as the "Sadinos" barely escaped relegation.
Fonte played 2010–11 on loan to RCD Espanyol, in Spain. He spent the vast majority of his spell with the reserves, his first La Liga appearances consisting of one minute in a 1–0 home win against Sporting de Gijón on 5 December 2010, and ten in a 0–1 home loss against Real Madrid, two months later.
On 14 July 2011 Fonte signed permanently for Espanyol, for two years. On 17 January of the following year he scored his first official goal for the "Pericos", in a 3–2 home win against CD Mirandés for the season's Copa del Rey – he also netted in the second leg, albeit in a 1–2 and 4–4 aggregate loss; in between he scored his first goal in the league, closing the scoresheet in a 3–0 home success over Granada CF.
On 29 January 2013 Fonte terminated his contract with Espanyol and, on the next day, signed with S.L. Benfica on a five-and-a-half-year contract. He was initially assigned to the B-team in the second level, suffering a knee injury in his debut against C.F. União and being sidelined for the rest of the season.
International career.
Fonte made his debut for the Portuguese under-21s against Spain on 18 November 2008, scoring the first goal in a 4–1 victory.
Personal.
Fonte's older brother, José, is also a footballer. A defender, he has played most of his professional career in England, and the two were teammates at Sporting (youth) and Crystal Palace.

Willingham St Mary

Willingham St Mary is a village and civil parish in the English county of Suffolk located about south of Beccles along the A145 in the District of Waveney. The village is joined with Shadingfield and west of Sotterley. At the 2001 census the parish had a population of 155. A joint parish council covers the parishes of Ellough, Shadingfield, Sotterley and Willingham St Mary.
The village has few services. Children attend primary school in Brampton and high school in Beccles. The "Shadingfield Fox" public house is within the parish boundary, although more commonly associated with Shadingfield. The parish church, which was dedicated to St Mary, is no longer standing.
History.
At the Domesday survey of 1086, the village of "Willingaham" formed part of the estates of Hugh de Montfort. It consisted of around 31 families, including at least 15 freemen, and paid 3 geld in taxation.
The village formed part of the estate of Elisabeth Bruisyard in 1281 and passed through various hands, including to the Playters of Sotterley, before becoming part of the estate of the Earl of Gosford who owned the manor in 1846. It consisted of around 1,000 acres and had a population of 156 in 1848, and Wilson's "Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales" of 1872 gives the population of the village as 142 in 31 houses. The population has fluctuated slightly, although it has remained largely unchanged since the 1801 census.
Willingham Hall, located to the east of the modern village, dates from the late 16th or early 17th century and is a Grade II listed building. It is located near to the site of the parish church which is believed to have fallen into disrepair at the beginning of the 16th century. The church, which was dedicated to St Mary and existed at the time of the Domesday survey, was recorded as 'scarcely visible' by Suckling in 1846, although some remains could be seen in the 1920s. The parish was united with North Cove in 1526 and consolidated with Ellough following the reformation, the stone from the church probably being used to repair All Saints Church, Ellough and St Margarets Church, Sotterley.
The area around the hall and church are thought to be the site of the medieval village. A number of ditches and pottery finds indicate buildings were located in this area and settlement is shown on a map from the late 18th century. Human bones have been observed in ploughsoil from the former churchyard.

Mycothiol

Mycothiol (MSH or AcCys-GlcN-Ins) is an unusual thiol compound found in the Actinobacteria. It is composed of a cysteine residue with an acetylated amino group linked to glucosamine, which is then linked to inositol. The oxidized, disulfide form of mycothiol (MSSM) is called mycothione, and is reduced to mycothiol by the flavoprotein mycothione reductase. Mycothiol biosynthesis and mycothiol-dependent enzymes such as mycothiol-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase and mycothione reductase have been proposed to be good drug targets for the development of treatments for tuberculosis.

Canovelles

Canovelles () is a municipality situated in the "comarca" of Vallès Oriental, in the province of Barcelona, part of the autonomous community of Catalonia in northeastern Spain. It is located about two kilometers from the local capital of Granollers, with which it forms a conurbation.
Population distribution.
The vast majority of the immigrants of the last decade and their descendants live in the "Barriada Nova" ("New Quarters"). However, the members of the immigrant wave in the 1960s and 1970s are gradually moving further into the peripheral districts. Public housing shortages and the high price of private housing are driving young people out of the area, and into municipalities in the same region.
Economy.
During the 1950s and 1960s, Canovelles saw a dramatic increase and immigration from other parts of Spain – namely from the nearby region of Barcelona. Because of this explosion in population, much of Canovelles’ economy stems from the service sector.
Another major source of regional economy comes from the weekly market held every Sunday, comprised by more than 500 shops. This market focus on the distribution of clothing, electronic devices and fruit.
History.
Numerous archeological finds from the Neolithic Period and the Roman Empire have been found in Canovelles. One representative is the “Menhir”, a replica of which is displayed at the Can Palots Theater exhibition hall.
The first time the term "Canovelles" appears in a document is in 1008 AD, in a document pertaining to the Abbot of Sant Cugat.
Between the 1950s and the 1970s, many families from Extremadura and Andalusia arrived to the municipality, increasing the population by a factor of twenty. Since the end of the 1990s people from Morocco, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America have been arriving to Canovelles in great numbers.
During the 1970s, clandestine groups of Marxists organized against the Franquist dictatorship, some of them comprised by more than a hundred militants.
Recent history.
A celebration was held in 2008 to celebrate the oldest document (written in 1008) in which a writer mentions the municipality's name.
In 2007, Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC) gained an absolute majority in the municipal government under the leadership of José Orive. In 2008, this government approved a thirty percent increase in pay for the mayor and local councillors. This pay increase marked José Orive as an object of controversy when hundreds of stickers criticizing the decision were posted on lampposts and other public objects throughout the municipality. After these stickers had been up for two days, the municipal government paid a cleaning company to remove them.

Portland Timbers U23s

Portland Timbers U23s is an American soccer team based in Portland, Oregon, United States. Although founded in 2008 as part of the development system for the Portland Timbers USSF D2 organization, beginning in 2011 they are part of the development system for the Major League Soccer franchise of the same name. The team plays in the USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. 
The team plays most of its home games at Providence Park, the home of the senior Timbers team, where they have played since 2009. The team's colors are green and white.
History.
The Timbers joined the PDL in 2009, and played their first ever game on May 9, 2009, against fellow expansion franchise Victoria Highlanders. The game finished 2-2, with the first goal in franchise history being scored by Jarad Van Schaik. The Timbers went on to enjoy a successful first season, eventually finishing second in the PDL Northwest division behind the Kitsap Pumas. The campaign was highlighted by several spectacular victories, including an 8-2 demolition of the Yakima Reds in late May in which seven different players got on the scoresheet, a 4-2 win over Cascade Surge which saw the Timbers score twice in the last six minutes to snatch the victory, and a high-scoring 4-3 win over Tacoma Tide which saw six goals in the first half. The Timbers lost the influential Warren Ukah to the pro-ranks half way through the season, but this did not stop the team enjoying a 5-game unbeaten run to finish the regular season which was capped off by a comprehensive 5-0 demolition of the Abbotsford Mariners on the last day of the season. Unfortunately for the Timbers they fell at the first hurdle in the playoffs, losing 3-2 to the Seattle Wolves after being 2-1 ahead with 9 minutes left, before allowing Seattle striker Alex Chursky to score twice in the dying moments, including an agonizing 90th minute winner. Ryan Youngblood was by far Portland's top marksman, finding the net 11 times, while Brent Richards contributed 4 assists.
The 2010 season saw the Timbers get off to a strong start, defeating the Washington Crossfire 3-1 in their opener on May 15. They continued their strong play, running off a string of six consecutive shutouts before finally allowing a goal in a 4-1 defeat of the Abbotsford Mariners on June 19. The Timbers continued their run, capping off a perfect regular season (16-0-0) with a 1-0 win at the Kitsap Pumas. Entering the playoffs as the #1 seed, the Timbers traveled to Bremerton, Washington for the Western Region finals. They advanced to the Championship round with 2-1 victories over the Hollywood United Hitmen and the host Pumas. The 2010 PDL Championship Series was held August 6–7 at PGE Park in Portland, Oregon. The participating teams were the Timbers as Western Champions, the Central Champions Thunder Bay (ON) Chill, the Baton Rouge (LA) Capitals as the Southern Champions and Reading United AC of Pennsylvania as the Eastern Champions. The opening round saw the Timbers defeat Reading and Thunder Bay win over Baton Rouge by identical 2-1 scores. On August 7, behind two goals from 2010 PDL Most Valuable Player Brent Richards, the Timbers defeated Thunder Bay 4-1 to become the first undefeated and untied champion in USL Professional Development League history

Rudolph Tegner

Rudolph Tegner (12 July 1873 - 5 June 1950) was a Danish sculptor linked to the Symbolist movement. In the early 20th century his work caused considerable controversy in Denmark. A large number of his works are on display in the Rudolph Tegner Museum north of Copenhagen.
Biography.
Tegner was the son of politician and businessman Jørgen Henry August Tegner and his wife Signe Elisabeth Puggaard. 
He travelled to Greece and to Italy as a young man, where he was particularly impressed by Michelangelo's sculptures in the Medici Chapel. His first major work, "A Faun" (1891) was installed at Charlottenburg Palace. From 1890 to 1893 he collaborated with the Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland, and then moved to Paris, where he resided until 1897. Tegner's sculptures developed the stylistic innovations of Art Nouveau and the erotic realism of Auguste Rodin. This caused widespread debate in Denmark, which was still heavily influenced by the restrained neo-classical ideals of Bertel Thorvaldsen. Tegner, in contrast, emphasised violent monumental forms which were both eye-catching and provocative.
Tegner was influenced strongly by the ideas of Frederich Nietzsche, especially as filtered through the writings of Georg Brandes. He created a statuette entitled "Lucifer with Brandes's Head" (1902), a reference to Brandes' nickname "Lucifer". It has been described as showing the author as if he were "almost like his own worst enemy, or at least seems unafraid of aiming barbs at himself." Images of struggling figures influenced by Nietzschean ideas run throughout his work. Brandes himself defended Tegner's most controversial work, a monument to the physician and Nobel Laureate Niels Finsen, which was installed in Copenhagen in 1909. It shows a standing naked man flanked by two kneeling naked women, reaching up to the sky. The sculpture was entitled "Mod lyset" (Towards the Light). It symbolised Finsen's principal scientific theory, that specific wavelengths of sunlight have healing properties.
In 1911 Tegner married the painter Elna Jørgensen (1889–1976). In 1916, he acquired barren uncultivated land in Zealand in the vicinity of Helsingør. He subsequently built a museum and sculpture park dedicated to his work in this bleak landscape. From 1917 on he installed a number of his sculptures there, mainly on classical themes. He also created a building in an uncompromising minimalist style to function as a museum for his work. He is buried in a mausoleum at the centre of the complex, which is open to the public.

Call Me Ted

Call Me Ted is an autobiography written by American businessman Ted Turner, released on November 10, 2008. The book was written over the course of three years with the help of Bill Burke, a former executive for TBS. 
Overview.
After dropping out of college, Turner began working for his father's billboard company, slowly turning it into an international media empire, including the creation of the first 24 hour news channel "CNN". Also discussed are some of Turner's more controversial business moves, such as the disastrous merger of his corporation Time Warner with AOL.
The book delves into Turner's personal life, including the death of his teenage sister, the suicide of his father, and his ten-year marriage to Jane Fonda, an Academy Award winning actress. 
Reception.
"Call Me Ted" received fairly positive reviews. Some critics noted that his desire not to dwell in the past raises inherent difficulties when writing an autobiography. The details of his business transactions earned praise.
"USA Today" said that "Turner's personality infuses every page of "Call Me Ted"," and named it "One of the best business books of 2008." "The Economist" said that "Mr. Turner is surprisingly candid... There is a remarkable lack of regret in Mr. Turner's writing, or of defensiveness... Mr. Turner's mantra seems to be to keep moving on." "The Daily Beast" said, "The new memoir "Call Me Ted" makes the Mouth of the South seem like a pleasant-even modest!-creature."

Operation Steel Box

Operation Steel Box, also known as Operation Golden Python, was a 1990 joint U.S.-West German operation which moved 100,000 U.S. chemical weapons from Germany to Johnston Atoll.
Background.
At a U.S. Army depot near Clausen, West Germany 100,000 GB and VX filled American chemical munitions were stored. The weapons in this depot were scheduled to be moved due to an agreement between the U.S. and West Germany. The 1986 agreement, between Ronald Reagan and Helmut Kohl, provided for the removal of 155 mm and 8 inch unitary chemical projectiles.
Operation.
Operation Steel Box began on July 26, 1990 and ended on September 22, 1990, but the weapons did not reach their final destination until November. The move from the storage facility to an intermediate facility at Miesau utilized trucks and trains, civilian contractors, and U.S. and West German military personnel. The weapons were repacked and shipped by truck from their storage facility until they reached the railway in Miesau. The truck transport portion of the mission involved 28 road convoys which delivered the munitions the 30 miles from Clausen to Miesau.
The munitions were carried by special ammunition train from Miesau to the port of Nordenham. The train transport was well publicized and escorted by 80 U.S. and West German military and police vehicles. At the port the munitions were loaded onto two modified ships, the SS "Gopher State" and the SS "Flickertail State", by the Army's Technical Escort Unit. The ships were operated by the U.S. Military Sealift Command, and upon leaving Nordenham they sailed for 46 straight days. The ships arrived at Johnston Atoll and on November 18 unloaded the last of their cargo containers.
Reaction and issues.
Security and emergency response.
Security and emergency response were both concerns during Steel Box. Besides the police and military escort for the trains, the road convoys had restricted airspace overhead. Along the route, emergency response teams were on stand-by. While the ships were inport U.S. Navy EOD Detachments provided underwater hull sweeps to ensure limpet mines were not attached to the ships. The 46 day trip at sea was non-stop, with refueling taking place along the route. The ships were also escorted by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser USS Bainbridge CGN-25 and USS Truxtun CGN-35. The transport ships avoided the Panama Canal, for security reasons, and took the route around Cape Horn, the tip of South America. There were no reported chemical agent leaks or security breaches during the transport phase of Steel Box.
International reaction.
The 1990 shipments of nerve agents from Germany to JACADS caused several South Pacific nations to express unease. At the 1990 South Pacific Forum in Vanuatu, the island nations of the South Pacific indicated that their concern was that the South Pacific would become a toxic waste dumping ground. Other concerns raised included the security of the shipments, which were refueled at sea and escorted by U.S. guided missile destroyers, while they were en route to Johnston Atoll. In Australia, Prime Minister Bob Hawke drew criticism from some of these island nations for his support of the chemical weapons destruction at Johnston Atoll.

Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister

"Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister" is a soliloquy written by Robert Browning, first published in his collection "Dramatic Lyrics" (1842). It is written in the voice of an unnamed Spanish monk. The poem consists of nine eight-line stanzas and is written in trochaic tetrameter. The plot of the poem centers around the speaker's hatred for "Brother Lawrence", a fellow monk in the cloister.
The speaker notes the trivial ways in which Brother Lawrence fails in his Christianity, and then plots to murder, or damn the soul of, Brother Lawrence. However, the poem ends before the speaker can finish, when he is interrupted by a fellow monk.
Text.
Gr-r-r—there go, my heart's abhorrence!
Water your damned flower-pots, do!
If hate killed men, Brother Lawrence,
God's blood, would not mine kill you!
What? your myrtle-bush wants trimming?
Oh, that rose has prior claims—
Needs its leaden vase filled brimming?
Hell dry you up with its flames!
At the meal we sit together;
Salve tibi! I must hear
Wise talk of the kind of weather, 
Sort of season, time of year:
Not a plenteous cork crop: scarcely
Dare we hope oak-galls, I doubt;
What's the Latin name for "parsley"?
What's the Greek name for "swine's snout"?
Whew! We'll have our platter burnished, 
Laid with care on our own shelf!
With a fire-new spoon we're furnished,
And a goblet for ourself,
Rinsed like something sacrificial
Ere 'tis fit to touch our chaps—
Marked with L. for our initial!
Saint, forsooth! While Brown Dolores 
Squats outside the Convent bank
With Sanchicha, telling stories,
Steeping tresses in the tank,
Blue-black, lustrous, thick like horsehairs,
—Can't I see his dead eye glow,
Bright as 'twere a Barbary corsair's?
When he finishes refection,
Knife and fork he never lays
Cross-wise, to my recollection,
As do I, in Jesu's praise.
I the Trinity illustrate,
Drinking watered orange pulp—
In three sips the Arian frustrate;
While he drains his at one gulp!
Oh, those melons! if he's able
We're to have a feast; so nice!
One goes to the Abbot's table,
All of us get each a slice.
How go on your flowers? None double?
Not one fruit-sort can you spy?
Strange!—And I, too, at such trouble,
Keep them close-nipped on the sly!
There's a great text in Galatians,
Once you trip on it, entails
Twenty-nine distinct damnations,
One sure, if another fails;
If I trip him just a-dying,
Sure of heaven as sure can be,
Spin him round and send him flying
Off to hell, a Manichee?
Or, my scrofulous French novel
On grey paper with blunt type!
Simply glance at it, you grovel
Hand and foot in Belial's gripe;
If I double down its pages
At the woeful sixteenth print,
When he gathers his greengages,
Ope a sieve and slip it in't?
Or, there's Satan!—one might venture
Pledge one's soul to him, yet leave
Such a flaw in the indenture
As he'd miss till, past retrieve,
Blasted lay that rose-acacia
We're so proud of! Hy, Zy, Hine...
'St, there's Vespers! Plena gratia
Ave, Virgo! Gr-r-r—you swine!

1919–20 Quebec Athletics season

The 1919–20 Quebec Athletics season was the Athletics' first and last season in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Quebec franchise, dating from the National Hockey Association (NHA), was re-activated after two seasons of dormancy. The team placed fourth and last in the league in both halves of the season to not qualify for the playoffs. The Quebec franchise would be transferred to Hamilton, Ontario before the next season.
Off-season.
The Quebec NHL franchise had been dormant for two seasons. In the first season, long-time manager Mike Quinn had retired due to ill health and the club's directors voted to suspend the team. Before the second season, the team had been sold to Percy Quinn (no relation), but Quinn was only using the franchise in an ill-fated attempt to resurrect the National Hockey Association (NHA). The NHL owners then cancelled the Quebec NHL franchise, leaving Quebec out of the league for a second season. In May 1919, Calder and Mike Quinn made efforts to return Quebec to the league. This led to the NHL approving a new franchise in December 1919, to be operated by the Quebec Athletic Club and the club's official name in the NHL was the Quebec Athletic Club, leaving the old 'Bulldogs' nickname behind. Mike Quinn returned to manage the team for the season.
Regular season.
Joe Malone and Jack McDonald from the Quebec NHA team were 'returned' to the new Quebec NHL team. Malone would lead the league in scoring with 39 goals. Malone would score seven goals in a game against Toronto on January 31, 1920 and six goals in a game against Ottawa on March 10, 1920.
On March 3, the Montreal Canadiens pummeled the Athletics 16–3, setting an all-time NHL record for goals by one team.
Playoffs.
The Athletics did not qualify for the playoffs.

Calder was immediately impressed and hired him to scan sales data from all over the country searching for unknown acts with significant sales. Together, Weiss and Calder turned Jive into a veritable hip hop and rap empire throughout the eighties, beginning with Whodini. 
Weiss continued working for Jive in various capacities helping establish such blockbuster pop acts as Britney Spears, Usher, Backstreet Boys, Justin Timberlake, 'N Sync and T-Pain. When Calder sought to retire from the business and sold Zomba to Bertelsmann, Weiss was appointed head of the resultant Zomba Label Group in 2004. In 2008, Weiss replaced music executive Clive Davis as Chairman of BMG Label Group, which was renamed RCA/Jive Label Group in early 2009. Weiss left the company in March 2011. Later on that year Sony Music underwent a major restructuring where multiple Jive Records artists were moved to Epic Records while other stayed with Jive as it moved under the RCA Music Group. In October 2011 Jive Records was dissolved with their artists being moved to RCA Records.

Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1982

The Arkansas gubernatorial election of 1982 was the second since Reconstruction in which an incumbent was defeated. Coincidentally, the first had been the preceding election. 
One-term Democratic Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton regained the position after having narrowly been defeated by Republican Frank D. White at the previous election. Clinton continued to serve until he was elected President of the United States in 1992.
Campaign.
Bill Clinton, one of the youngest ex-governors in the nation, at the age of 36, was running to reclaim his political career. Frank White easily won renomination from the Republican party. The rematch was a feisty one, and Clinton won the election, and would run again in 1984, 1986, and 1990, until his presidential victory in November 1992.

Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino

The Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino (English: "Chilean Museum of Pre-Columbian Art") is an art museum dedicated to the study and display of pre-Columbian artworks and artifacts from Central and South America. The museum is located in the city centre of Santiago, the capital of Chile. The museum was founded by the Chilean architect and antiquities collector Sergio Larraín García-Moreno, who had sought premises for the display and preservation of his private collection of pre-Columbian artefacts acquired over the course of nearly fifty years. With the support of Santiago's municipal government at the time, García-Moreno secured the building and established the museum's curatorial institution. The museum first opened in December 1981 and has been closed since late 2011 for renovation. It is scheduled to reopen in November 2013. 
Building.
The museum is housed in the Palacio de la Real Aduana that was constructed between 1805 and 1807. It is located a block west of the Plaza de Armas and close to the Palacio de los Tribunales de Justicia de Santiago and the Former National Congress Building.
Collection.
Items in the museum's collections are drawn from the major pre-Columbian culture areas of Mesoamerica, Intermediate / Isthmo-Colombian, Pan-Caribbean, Amazonia and the Andean. The museum has over 3,000 people representing almost 100 different groups of people. The collection ranges from about 10,000 years. The original collection was acquired based on the aesthetic quality of the objects, instead of their scientific or historical context. The collection is broken up into four areas:

USS Wantuck (APD-125)

USS "Wantuck" (APD-125) was a United States Navy high-speed transport in commission from 1944 to 1957.
Construction and commissioning.
Originally projected as a "Rudderow"-class destroyer escort (DE-692), "Wantuck" (APD-125) was selected for completion to a modified design as a high-speed transport (APD), designed for landing and supporting raiding parties while retaining a secondary, destroyer escort-like role of convoy escort. She was laid down on 17 August 1944 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Company. launched on 25 September 1944, sponsored by Miss Mary Wantuck, and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard at Boston, Massachusetts, on 30 December 1944, Lieutenant Commander Richard Bensen, USNR, in command.
World War II.
"Wantuck" conducted shakedown training along the New England coast and then in the vicinity of Bermuda until 18 February 1945, when she arrived in Hampton Roads, Virginia. On 21 February 1945, she departed Norfolk, Virginia, bound via the Panama Canal, San Diego, California, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for World War II service in the Western Pacific. She arrived at Oahu on 21 March 1945 and got underway again on 2 April 1945. She stopped at Eniwetok for the night of 10 April 1945-11 April 1945 and then resumed her voyage. She touched at Guam in the Mariana Islands on 14 April 1945 and then pushed on to the lagoon at Ulithi Atoll. There, she joined a convoy bound for the Ryukyu Islands and arrived in Kerama Retto near Okinawa on 21 April 1945. She remained at Okinawa screening the American ships there until 30 April 1945 when she got underway in the screen of a convoy containing 16 other ships bound for Saipan in the Marianas.
However, after seeing them safely out of the Ryukyus, she returned to Okinawa and resumed her duty screening the ships remaining at Kerama Retto. On 4 May 1945, she helped repulse an enemy air attack but claimed no kills or assists for herself. Later that day, when a "kamikaze" struck light cruiser USS "Birmingham" (CL-62), "Wantuck" went to the aid of the stricken cruiser. On 5 May 1945, she departed Okinawa in company with damaged "Birmingham" and destroyer-minesweeper USS "Rodman" (DMS-21) and set a course for Ulithi. En route, however, the ships received orders diverting them to Guam in the Marianas and, for the next two months, "Wantuck" made regular shuttle runs escorting convoys between Guam and Okinawa. That particular routine ended on 5 July 1945 when she departed Guam for Leyte in the Philippines. She entered San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 8 July 1945 and then headed back to Okinawa. She served in the Ryukyus for more than a month, during which the surrender of Japan ended World War II on 15 August 1945.
World War II honors and awards.
"Wantuck" earned one battle star during World War II, for the Okinawa Gunto operation (Assault and Occupation of Okinawa Gunto), covering various dates from 21 April 1945 to 15 August 1945.
Post World War II.
With the war over, "Wantuck" embarked troops for the planned occupation of Japan and joined the United States Third Fleet on 18 August 1945. She entered Tokyo Bay on 27 August 1945 and disembarked her share of the occupation force. On 30 August 1945, she moved to the Yokosuka Naval Station where she began loading Allied prisoners of war from the hospital ship USS "Benevolence" (AH-13). During the first week of September 1945, she made calls at various Japanese ports embarking former Allied prisoners of war. On 7 September 1945, she transferred her passengers to destroyer USS "Lansdowne" (DD-486). On 9 September 1945, "Wantuck" took several British prisoners on board and the next day transferred them to a Royal Navy destroyer. She continued to shuttle former prisoners of war between locations in Japan until 2 October 1945, at which time she headed for the Marianas.
"Wantuck" arrived at Guam on 5 October 1945 and remained there until 19 October 1945 when she headed back to Yokosuka, Japan. She reached Yokosuka on 22 October 1945, but got underway again on 30 October 1945. Steaming via Guam, she arrived at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands on 8 November 1945 but that same day headed for Rabaul. where she arrived on 9 November 1945. On 18 November 1945 she began a circuitous voyage back to the United States.
After stops at Manus, Guam, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor, "Wantuck" reached San Francisco. California, on 21 December 1945.
On 3 January 1946, "Wantuck" entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, for an overhaul which she completed on 10 March 1946. That same day, she sailed for her new home port, San Diego. For almost a year, she operated out of San Diego, primarily conducting amphibious warfare exercises at San Clemente Island.
On 24 February 1947, "Wantuck" departed San Diego for a three-month voyage to the Western Pacific. Her ports of call included Pearl Harbor, Kwajalein, Manus, and Guam. She returned to San Diego on 19 June 1947 and resumed normal operations out of that port, which she continued until the beginning of 1948.
On 15 January 1948, "Wantuck" again stood out of San Diego for a voyage to the Western Pacific. After stops at Pearl Harbor, Kwajalein, and Guam, she arrived in Tsingtao, China, on 15 February 1948. For the next six months, she cruised along the China coast, observing conditions during the latter stages of the Chinese Civil War, and transported Chinese Nationalist troops to various locations in support of their efforts against the Chinese Communists. On 16 August 1948, "Wantuck" departed Tsingtao to return to the United States. She made stops at Guam, Kwajalein, and Pearl Harbor before reentering San Diego on 9 September 1948 and resumed normal United States West Coast operations.
Early in 1950, "Wantuck" made a round-trip voyage to Alaskan waters and back to San Diego before departing San Diego on 1 May 1950 to deploy overseas once more. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 9 May 1950 to 12 May 1950 and then continued her voyage west. After stops in the Mariana and Philippine Islands, "Wantuck" arrived at Hong Kong on 7 June 1950.
Korean War.
While "Wantuck" was at Hong Kong, war erupted in Korea when communist North Korean troops invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, beginning the Korean War. Whether or not this event prompted "Wantuck"s unusually long stay — three months — in a liberty port for a warship is not clear, but she did not leave Hong Kong until 6 September 1950. From there, the ship moved to Sasebo, Japan, where she arrived on 8 September 1950.
On 10 September 1950, "Wantuck" was in the Korean combat zone at the port of Pusan preparing for the amphibious assault at Inchon. She departed Pusan on 13 September 1950 with elements of the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, embarked. Early on the morning of 15 September 1950, "Wantuck" was off Wolmi-do, an island just off Inchon. Her troops stormed ashore on the island and quickly consolidated their position in preparation for the second phase of the operation, the invasion of Inchon itself scheduled for that afternoon. "Wantuck" remained at Inchon supporting the consolidation and expansion of the beachhead until 26 September 1950, at which time she returned to Yokosuka, Japan.
"Wantuck" returned to Korea early in October 1950 with Royal Marine Commandos embarked. In cooperation with high-speed transport USS "Horace A. Bass" (APD-124) and supported by destroyer USS "De Haven" (DD-727), she executed a series of raids near Wonsan to disrupt North Korean transportation facilities — primarily rail lines — to support a scheduled amphibious attack on Wonsan. "Wantuck" returned to Japan on 10 October 1950 and the Wonsan amphibious assault operation was obviated by the fact that Republic of Korea (ROK) troops entered Wonsan from landward on 11 October 1950.
"Wantuck" did not arrive back in Korean waters again until 20 October 1950, once again at Wonsan. By that time, however, United Nations efforts to reopen the port of Wonsan were well advanced, and "Wantuck" saw no further combat duty during that deployment. She returned to Yokosuka on 25 November 1950 and, on 28 November 1950, headed back to the United States. After stops at Midway Atoll and Pearl Harbor, she arrived in San Diego on 15 December 1950.
"Wantuck" spent almost eight months conducting normal operations along the United States West Coast out of San Diego. Then on 23 July 1951, she headed westward once again for the Far East. Following calls at Pearl Harbor and at Midway Atoll, she arrived in Yokosuka on 22 August 1951. By the time of "Wantuck"s return to Korea, the war had degenerated into a stalemate on land with the principals locked in armistice negotiations and jockeying for military advantage at the bargaining table. At sea, the naval war had become almost purely one of aircraft carrier operations with planes interdicting communist supply routes and hitting strategic targets in North Korea. "Wantuck" resumed duty with Task Force 90, the Amphibious Force, and consequently took little active part in the conflict from that point. In fact, during her 1951-1952 deployment, she did not even qualify for the Korean Service Medal, though she did visit Korean ports on occasion, particularly Inchon and Pusan. She departed Yokosuka late in March 1952 and, after a stop at Oahu along the way, reentered San Diego on 19 April 1952.
"Wantuck" remained on the U.S. West Coast for almost a year. A paucity of movements on her part — limited to one move to San Francisco in September 1952 for a three-month stay before returning to San Diego in December 1952 — suggests a period of extensive repairs probably including an overhaul. In any event, she departed San Diego again on 7 March 1953 and steamed via Pearl Harbor to the Far East. She arrived in Yokosuka on 30 March 1953 and, though she patrolled extensively in Korean waters, her operations were essentially as peaceful as they had been during the previous deployment. In July 1953, the signing of the armistice made those peaceful conditions permanent.
Korean War honors and awards.
"Wantuck" earned seven battle stars during the Korean War, for the following campaigns:
Post Korean War.
"Wantuck" conducted patrols, training exercises, and port visits for the remainder of her 1953 Korean deployment. On 9 November 1953, she departed Yokosuka to return to the United States. En route she stopped at Midway and Pearl Harbor before arriving in San Diego on 25 November 1953.
Over the remaining four years of her active career, "Wantuck" made two more cruises to the Far East, one in 1954—during which she operated out of Hong Kong—and another in 1955. In 1956 and the first half of 1957, her zone of operations centered in two areas, the California coast and the waters around Alaska.
Collision with USS "Lenawee".
In mid-August 1957, "Wantuck" got underway from San Diego for Hawaii on the first leg of a voyage to Japan. She was about 180 nautical miles (333 kilometers) from San Diego on a moonless and starless night when at 0318 hours on 15 August 1957 the attack transport USS "Lenawee" (APA-195) rammed her on the port side between the No.1 boiler room and No. 1 engine room, almost tearing "Wantuck" in half, the impact being powerful enough to bring her forward momentum to an immediate stop and shove her laterally to starboard. "Wantuck" suffered two men killed—one who drowned in the flooding engine room and another scalded by high-pressure steam—and five injured, all burned. The submarine rescue ship USS "Florikan" (ASR-9) and fleet ocean tug USS "Cree" (ATF-84) came to "Wantuck"s aid, while "Lenawee" took some of "Wantuck"s injured men aboard and proceeded to Pearl Harbor.
"Wantuck" arrived in San Diego under tow on the evening of 16 August 1957.
Decommissioning and disposal.
Deemed not worth repairing, "Wantuck" was decommissioned at San Diego on 15 November 1957 and berthed there with the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 4 March 1958, and she was sold on 27 October 1958 to the Sundfelt Equipment Company, Inc., of Wilmington, California. Presumably she was scrapped.

Sherman E. Burroughs High School

Sherman E. Burroughs High School is a public high school located in Ridgecrest, CA. Established in 1945, the school is located in the upper Mojave Desert and is adjacent to the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. It derives its name from U.S. Navy officer Admiral Sherman E. Burroughs, who served as the first commanding officer of the base at China Lake (then known as the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake). The school's mascot, the Burro, is taken from the animal which was imported to the area.
Burroughs was originally housed at what is now called Murray Middle School aboard the base, but moved to its current site in 1960.
History.
The Secretary of the Navy created the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake on Nov. 8, 1943, and the need for an educational system for the families stationed at the base was included in the plans. Working with the California Department of Education and the legislature, the China Lake School District was established on May 22, 1944.
After additional meetings and planning, construction began in May 1945 and was completed in November of that same year. F. R. Wegner was the first principal and Earl Murray was Vice Principal.
The buildings and Quonset huts that made up the original campus of Burroughs High School later became Murray Middle School as Burroughs moved to where it is today.
Athletics.
During its history, Burroughs High School has accumulated seven California Interscholastic Federation championships.
Successful athletic teams at Burroughs have always had the ability to play well on the road, with its nearest competitor typically 2–3 hours away. It is currently a member of the Desert Sky League.
It marked the first major championship in any sport for the green and white and the boys varsity basketball team, known then as the 'A' squad, ran off a 21-3 record on their way to the section championship. In the 4-team Desert Inyo League, the Burros went a perfect 12-0 over Palmdale, Victor Valley and Barstow.<br>Center Jay Carty led the team and was the first athlete from the Indian Wells Valley to play professional sports. After playing at Oregon State University. He was selected by the St. Louis Hawks in the 6th round (48th pick overall) of the 1962 NBA Draft and later played for the Los Angeles Lakers (1968–69) in the NBA for 28 games.<br>Burroughs defeated San Luis Obispo in the opening round 51-35 before advancing to the semifinals where they beat St. Agnes 65-52. In the finals the Burros had to hold off a strong Bell Gardens team in a squeaker, 41-40. <br> First-year head coach Jim Nau led the squad to the title, and would be the only year he would coach the locals. Members of the team included: Gary Maxwell, Stuart Young, Larry Fletcher, Joel Adams, Jay Carty, Bill Wilde, Ron Thimsen, John Dragovich, Dennis Henden, Doug Brewer, Gary Koehler, Ray Wilson, Rad Bushnell and Phil Donnell.
Under head Coach Larry Bird, the Burros (24-6, 10-0) claimed their fourth consecutive Golden League Championship as they headed into the playoffs. The league streak would eventually extend to 11 ('78/'79 to '88/'89), ranking third all-time in the CIF Southern Section. Burroughs entered the post season ranked a school best #4 in the polls and defeated Victor Valley, San Bernardino, and Righetti to reach the semifinals at the Long Beach Sports Arena. The Burros matched up with #1 ranked La Serna in the semifinals and advanced with a 66-55 victory. The Burros then faced Capistrano Valley in the finals and won 66-55. An estimated 5,000 people made the more than 3-hour trek to witness the game.
Burroughs advanced to the first-ever state championship tournament, earning a win over Washington Union before finally falling to Banning in the semifinals. Members of the team included: Dalton Heyward, Daniel Means, David Wooten, Scott Fulton, Dale Killilea, Paul Vander Werf, Bobby Bruce, John Fry, Greg Peake, Paul LaMarca, Jim Cleveland, Jim White and Tim Allen. The coaching staff consisted of Head Coach Larry Bird and Assistants Bill Campbell, Frank Mazer and Jack Clark.
After years of dominating the waters of the Golden and Mojave River Leagues, Burroughs claimed its first CIF-SS Title in boys' Swimming. The Burros amassed 174 points in the meet, outscoring second place Laguna Hills by 36 points. The team consisted of well-rounded cast of athletes, but was led by freshman phenomenon David Chan who was named Swimmer of the Meet. As with its to subsequent titles, the team's dominance in the water was highlighted by its absence out of it. The competition had both swimming and diving components, and the Burros had no one competing in the latter. Long-time head coach Charlie Lattig was at the helm for all three titles. <br> Members of the team included David Chan, Andy Lopez, Dale Garland, Mark Garland, Ryan Lopez, Ryan Webb and Haydn Wilson.
Burroughs continued its dominance of the CIF pool in 1995, claiming its second consecutive division title in Long Beach by edging Jurupa Valley 186-185. This time out the squad was smaller, but the result was the same as Burroughs did not field a diving squad. David Chan won his second straight Swimmer of the Meet title and was named as an All-American. <br> Members of the team included David Chan, Dale Garland, Mark Garland and Ryan Lopez.
The Burros effected a 'Three-peat' in winning the title again. And again, Chan was named the Swimmer of the Meet. Ryan Lopez combined with Mark and Dale Garland to round out what is arguably the most competitive foursome ever seen in a CIF pool. <br> Members of the team included David Chan, Dale Garland, Mark Garland and Ryan Lopez. <br>As the 1997 season neared, Chan was named to the US Junior National Team and was on track to be part of the 2000 US Olympic squad. But he was diagnosed with an osteosarcoma in his right shoulder joint. Surgery and radiation treatments were required and he was forced to have more than 70% of his muscle tissue removed to extract the cancer. He returned to the team as a swimmer/coach in 1997, swimming with one arm and still defeating the league foes that he faced.
It was well worth the long wait for the members of the 2003 Girls Swim Team. After a season that saw them perform better at a variety meets that they had in years past, the Lady Burros claimed the school's first-ever CIF Championship for women. Burroughs took to the waters of the Long Beach Aquatics Center on May 16–17 to compete in the CIF Finals. While they were able to post a handful of first-place finishes in the pre-lims, Burroughs failed to win an event in the finals. But their overall strength in the individual and relay events earned them a nine-point margin of victory over Yucaipa High School. The Lady Burros finished with 252 points, while Yucaipa had 243. Rounding out the top competitors were La Serna High School at 234 and Murrieta Valley High School at 171. As with the boys championships of '94-'96, Burroughs did not field any divers.
The Lady Burros were coached by Greg Janson. Team members included: Jenna Marvin, Cindy Bithel, Lani Seaman, Kari Seaman, Amy Speer, Lisa Speer, Jennifer Schwalb, Jessica Schwalb, Kym Bauer, Stacy Davis, Moriah Baker, Danielle Herteg and Monika Lee.
Burroughs brought home the first CIF football championship in the school's history under the direction of Head Coach Jeff Steinberg, who was coaching in his final season at the high school. The Burros wrapped up the season with an 11-3 overall record, with two of their three losses coming to fellow section champions Canyon and St. Bonaventure. Burroughs defeated Colony and Sultana in the first two rounds of the playoffs at home, then traveled to Palm Desert to defeat the then-unbeaten Aztecs, and clinched the title with a 42-30 win over the Palm Springs High School Indians on Dec. 10, 2005. <br>Notable players on the championship squad included seniors QB David LaFromboise, WR Hayo Carpenter, RB Anthony Williams, and defensive standouts Ron Marker and Shawn Parker. <br>Following their victory, the Burros were honored with a parade down Balsam Street in Ridgecrest, and a victory rally.
From 1978 to 1989 the Burros won or shared the Golden league title in Boys Basketball for 11 consecutive years. At the end of its run in 1989, the accomplishment placed them third on the CIF-SS All-Time list behind Banning (17 titles, '77-'93), Bishop (12 titles, '72-'83) and tied with Pasadena (11 titles, '71-'81). Burroughs and Pasadena are currently tied for 7th on the list. Larry Bird was the head coach for the first seven years of the run, while Frank Mazer was at the helm for the final four. Mazer had been a JV and freshman coach during Bird's tenure at Burroughs. Pg. 34.
In addition to their championship in 2005, the Burros made the CIF finals in football in 1974 (losing to Neff High School under the direction of Head Coach Bruce Bernhardi), and in 2003 (losing to Kaiser High School 44-34 under the direction of Steinberg).
Burroughs High School has also fielded excellent cross country and track teams over the years. During the mid to late 1980s, both men's and women's teams regularly captured Golden League titles, the men's team went undefeated in Golden League dual meets from 1987-1988. In 1988 the men's team won the Quartz Hill Relays which also featured a meet record from the men's 4x800 relay team (Anthony Asborno, Bobby Moldenhauer, Brian Lindsey, Jack Osborne). Osborne was also a winner of the 1987 Arcadia Invitational 2 Mile in a school record 9:20.
District.
Burroughs High School is a member of the Sierra Sands Unified School District (S.S.U.S.D.). The district is renowned for consistently high test scores from its students.

Temistocle

Temistocle ("Themistocles") is an opera seria in three acts by the German composer Johann Christian Bach. The Italian text is an extensive revision of the libretto by Metastasio, by Mattia Verazi, court poet and private secretary to the Elector Palatine Carl Theodor. 
The opera was the first of two for the Elector Palatine. Some of the music was reused from earlier works, including part of the overture from "Carattaco" (composed in London in 1767).
Performance history.
"Temistocle" was first performed at the Hoftheater in Mannheim on 4 November 1772, with a notable cast including Anton Raaff and Dorothea and Elisabeth Wendling, all singers that later worked with Mozart.
Synopsis.
The opera takes place in Persia. Temistocle, together with his son Neocle, has been expelled from Athens. He arrives incognito at Susa, the capital of his arch-enemy King Serse, to find that his daughter Aspasia (in love with the Athenian ambassador Lisimaco) has also made her way there, following a shipwreck. Eventually all is revealed and Serse magnanimously pardons everybody, unites the lovers and makes peace with Athens.
Recordings.
There are no complete recordings of the opera, generally available, though the overture is available on CD, for example on Johann Christian Bach: Complete Opera Overtures, performed by the Hanover Band conducted by Anthony Halstead (CPO Records 9999632, 2003). WorldCat records a CD made of the opera Temistocle available at http://www.worldcat.org/title/j-c-bach-temistocle/oclc/604044585.

Ashley Rickards

Ashley Nicole Rickards (born May 4, 1992) is an American actress, known for her role in MTV's "Awkward" as Jenna Hamilton, and as Samantha "Sam" Walker, a troubled young girl taken in by Brooke Davis who becomes her foster-mother, in The CW teen drama series "One Tree Hill". She also starred in the 2011 independent drama film "Fly Away" as Mandy, a severely autistic girl.
Biography.
Rickards grew up on a horse farm that catered for children with special needs. She attended a local Montessori school where, at age 13, she had her first taste of acting in an opera production. Rickards graduated from high school at age fifteen and is a member of Mensa. After attending a local talent showcase, organized by Lou Perlman, Rickards traveled to Los Angeles where she eventually gathered a team of representatives. Upon graduating, Rickards began to appear in a number of minor roles, as child labor laws restricted the number of hours she was able to work. After making a number of guest appearances and shorts, she landed the role of Samantha Walker, a runaway foster child, in "One Tree Hill" for the 2008-2009 season. Although not aware of the show before auditioning, Rickards found that she "learned so much from acting techniques to different ways of shooting things". Her character did not return the following season, while in the same year she had a bit part in her first feature film, "Gamer".
Rickards spent much of 2009 attending auditions while a proposed lead-role in the film "Dirty Girl" fell through. In 2010 she appeared opposite Jimmy Smits in an episode of the legal drama "Outlaw" while she also auditioned for the lead-role in "Awkward". Initially rejected, her manager Adam Griffin sent the producers a tape Rickards had made for "Fly Away" "to show how she can do anything". The actress landed both roles and filmed the pilot for the MTV series prior to "Fly Away", a feature where she played a severely autistic girl. 
A former competitive equestrian, she helped to launch the Project Futures Somaly Mam Foundation (2011), which works to prevent and end human trafficking and sexual slavery in Southeast Asia. Rickards writes poetry, scripts, and enjoys painting in her spare time. She also appeared in The Fray's video for "How to Save a Life", and also in The Format's video for "She Doesn't Get It".

Oxaprotiline

Oxaprotiline, also known as hydroxymaprotiline, is a psychoactive drug and research chemical of the tetracyclic chemical class. Though investigated as an antidepressant, it was never developed and marketed for clinical use.
Chemistry.
Oxaprotiline is a racemic compound composed of two isomers, "R"(-)- or levo- oxaprotiline (levoprotiline; CGP-12,103-A), and "S"(+)- or dextro- oxaprotiline (dextroprotiline; CGP-12,104-A). Both enantiomers are active, with the levo- form acting merely as an antihistamine and the dextro- form having a more expansive pharmacology (see below), but with both curiously still retaining antidepressant effects.
Pharmacology.
Dextroprotiline acts as a potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and H1 receptor antagonist, as well as a very weak α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist. It has negligible affinity for the serotonin transporter, dopamine transporter, α2-adrenergic receptor, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Whether it has any antagonistic effects on the 5-HT2 or D2 receptors like its relative maprotiline is unclear.
Levoprotiline acts as a selective H1 receptor antagonist, with no affinity for adrenaline, dopamine, muscarinic acetylcholine, or serotonin receptors, or any of the monoamine transporters.

<doc id="20174341" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20174341" title="Klismos">
Klismos

A klismos (Greek: κλισμός) or klismos chair is a type of ancient Greek chair, familiar from depictions of ancient furniture on painted pottery and in bas-reliefs from the mid-fifth century BCE onwards. In epic, "klismos" signifies an armchair, but no specific description is given of its form; in "Iliad" xxiv, after Priam's appeal, Achilles rises from his "thronos", raises the elder man to his feet, goes out to prepare Hector's body for decent funeral and returns, to take his place on his "klismos".
A vase-painting of a satyr carrying a klismos chair on his shoulder shows how light such chairs were. The curved, tapered legs of the klismos chair sweep forward and rearward, offering stability. The rear legs sweep continuously upward to support a wide concave backrest like a curved tablet, which supports the sitter's shoulders, or which may be low enough to lean an elbow on.
The klismos fell from general favour during the Hellenistic period; nevertheless, the theatre of Dionysus at the foot of the Acropolis, Athens, of the first century CE, has carved representations of "klismoi". Where a klismos is represented in Roman portraits of seated individuals, the sculptures are copies of Greek works. The fall of the klismos might be due to a design flaw, the legs of the chair are bending outwards and without any further support the legs will spread out and break when sat upon.
The klismos was revived during the second, archaeological phase of European neoclassicism. Klismos chairs were first widely seen in Paris in the furniture made for the painter Jacques-Louis David by Georges Jacob in 1788, to be used as props in David's historical paintings, where the new sense of historicism required visual authenticity. It would be hard to find a French klismos chair earlier than the ones designed by the architect Jean-Jacques Lequeu in 1786 for a decor in the "Etruscan style" for the hôtel Montholon, boulevard Montmartre, and executed by Jacob; the furnishings have disappeared, but the watercolor designs are conserved in the Cabinet des Estampes. Simon Jervis has noted that Joseph Wright of Derby included the tablet of an approximation of a klismos chair in his "Penelope Unraveling Her Web", 1783-84 (J. Paul Getty Museum).
In London, early klismos chairs were designed by Thomas Hope for his house in Duchess Street, London, which George Beaumont had described as early as 1804 as "more a "Museum" than anything else"; klismos chairs were illustrated by Hope in several variations in "Household Furniture and Interior Decoration" (1807), the record of his semi-public house-museum. Klismos chairs in their purest form furnished Hope's Picture Gallery (pl. II) and the Second Room containing Greek Vases (pl. IV), but the swept legs featured in variations on the classical theme illustrated in other plates. Henry Moses' illustration of genteel company playing cards seated on klismos chairs appeared in Hope's "Designs of Modern Costume" (c. 1812).
By the presence of fashionable klismos chairs and a collection of Greek vases, a self-portrait of Adam Buck and his family, significantly, was formerly thought to represent Thomas Hope. Klismos chairs were designed for Packington Hall, Warwickshire, by Joseph Bonomi.
In Philadelphia, the architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe designed a set of klismos chairs for an interior in the most advanced neoclassical taste for William Waln's drawing-room, c. 1808. Latrobe's design, painted cream and red on a black background, the "Etruscan" color range, included a panel of caning beneath the tablet backrest and legs that splayed outwards to the sides as well as the front. For the White House, Latrobe's designs of 1809 for klismos chairs are cautiously reinforced with stretchers to render them more sturdy. A range of early 19th-century American klismos chairs were included in the exhibition "Classical Taste in America, 1800-1840", Baltimore Museum of Art, 1993.
Such severely academic revivals might be compromised by more familiar features of the chair-maker's usual practice: an early 19th-century klismos chair by J.E. Höglander, Stockholm has a padded backrest, supported on five slender colonettes, and the faces of the legs are lightly paneled.
The classicizing phase of Modernism allied with Art Deco found the simple lines of the klismos once again in favor: klismos chairs designed by the Danish Edvard Thomspon were illustrated in "Architekten", 1922. In 1960, T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings met Greek cabinetmakers Susan and Eleftherios Saridis, and, together, they created the Klismos line of furniture, recreating ancient Greek furnishings with some accuracy, including klismos chairs.
Construction.
The long and elegant curve was quite difficult to create; or by using mortise and tenon joints, or by training the wood.
The seat was built of four wooden turned staves, morticed into the legs; a web of cording or leather strips supported a cushion or a pelt. The klismos was a specifically Greek invention, without detectable earlier inspiration.

Helwan retouch

The Helwan Retouch was a bifacial microlithic flint-tool fabrication technology characteristic of the Early Natufian culture in the Levant, a region in the Eastern Mediterranean (12,500 BP – 11,000 BP) such as the Harifian culture. The decline of the Helwan Retouch was largely replaced by the "backing" technique and coincided with the emergence of microburin methods, which involved snapping bladelets on an anvil. Natufian lithic technology throughout the usage of the Helwan Retouch was dominated by lunate-shaped lithics, such as picks and axes and especially sickles (which were predominantly—at least 80% of the time—used for harvesting wild cereals).

Samuel Sanford

Samuel Simons Sanford (15 March 18496 January 1910) was an American pianist and educator.
He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He studied piano in New York with William Mason (son of Lowell Mason and student of Franz Liszt and Ignaz Moscheles). He went to Paris and studied with Alfred Jaëll, Louis Plaidy (teacher of Hans von Bülow and many others), Théodore Ritter (another student of Liszt), and Édouard Batiste. In 1869, he became acquainted with Anton Rubinstein, and later studied with him. He travelled with Rubinstein during his first American tour in 1872-73. Ignacy Jan Paderewski changed his execution of octave playing after hearing Sanford play, and once described Sanford as the most musically gifted person he ever knew. 
Sanford brought Sir Edward Elgar's music to American attention through the brothers Walter and Frank Damrosch and Theodore Thomas. He was instrumental in having Elgar awarded an honorary doctorate in music from Yale University in 1905; at the conferral ceremony on 28 June, Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 was played, instituting the tradition of playing noble processional music at graduation ceremonies. Later that year, Elgar returned the compliment by dedicating his "Introduction and Allegro" to Sanford.
Sanford joined the Yale Music Faculty as Professor of Applied Music in 1894, along with Horatio Parker as Professor of Theory. During the sixteen years he worked at Yale, he refused to be paid any salary as he was independently wealthy.
He died on 6 January 1910 after a long illness.
Sanford Medal.
In 1972 Yale University instituted the Samuel Simons Sanford Medal (usually referred to as the Sanford Medal), to honour celebrated concert artists and distinguished members of the music profession. Recipients have included:

Hugo Bettauer

Hugo Bettauer (18 August 1872 – 26 March 1925), born Maximilian Hugo Bettauer, was a prolific Austrian writer and journalist, who was murdered by a Nazi Party follower on account of his controversial views. He was very well known in his lifetime; many of his books were bestsellers and in the 1920s a number were made into films, most notably "Die freudlose Gasse" ("The Joyless Street", directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst, 1925), which dealt with prostitution, and "Die Stadt ohne Juden" ("The City Without Jews", directed by Hans Karl Breslauer, 1924), a satire against antisemitism.
Life.
Maximilian Hugo Bettauer, later known as Hugo Bettauer, was born in Baden bei Wien on 18 August 1872, the son of the stockbroker Arnold (Samuel Aron) Bettauer from Lemberg (Lviv) and his wife Anna (née Wecker). He had two older sisters, Hermine (Michi) and Mathilde. In 1887-88, together with Karl Kraus, he attended the fourth form of the Franz-Joseph-Gymnasium in the Stubenbastei, Vienna. Kraus was to be his fiercest critic for the whole of his life.
At the age of 16 Bettauer ran away from home and travelled to Alexandria, from where the Austrian Consul sent him straight back again.
In 1890 Bettauer converted from the Jewish faith to the Evangelical church. In the same year he joined the "Kaiserjäger" (Imperial mountain infantry) as a one-year volunteer. The change of religion was presumably connected with the fact that Jewish soldiers who lacked noble status found it virtually impossible to make any kind of career in the military, and for conversion purposes the Evangelical Church was preferable to the Roman Catholic Church.
Marriage and emigration.
After five months in Tyrol he left the army again, due to difficulties with his superiors. Together with his mother he moved to Zürich and in 1896, aged 24, gained possession of his substantial inheritance from his father.
In Zürich he married the love of his youth, Olga Steiner, with whom, after the death of his mother, he emigrated to the United States. During the crossing, in a disastrous speculation Bettauer lost his entire fortune. He and Olga remained until 1899 in New York City, where she appeared as an actress. Although Bettauer acquired American citizenship, he was unable to find work, so they travelled to Berlin, where their son Heinrich Gustav Hellmuth Bettauer was born. (Their son went by the name Helmut and was transported to Auschwitz in 1942, where he presumably died.)
In Berlin Bettauer worked as a journalist and made a name for himself in connection with the exposure of a number of scandals. Among other things he wrote in the aftermath of one such scandal the book "Bobbie", which appeared in 1921, in which he described a rich and powerful child abductor.
In 1901, after the suicide of the director of the "Berliner Hoftheater", whom he had accused of corruption, Bettauer was expelled from Prussia. He then moved to Munich, where he worked in the cabaret "Die Elf Scharfrichter" ("The eleven executioners") and in the autumn of 1901 went to Hamburg to become director of the specialist publication "Küche und Keller" ("Kitchen and Cellar").
Second marriage.
After his first marriage had ended in divorce, Bettauer became acquainted in Hamburg with his future second wife, Helene Müller, who at the time was aged 16. In 1904 they eloped to America. They married during the crossing, and in the same year their son Reginald Parker Bettauer was born. In New York Bettauer worked as a newspaper journalist, and also began to write serial novels for newspaper publication.
In 1910 he returned to Vienna and took a job with the "Neue Freie Presse". When at the beginning of World War I he wanted to join the army he was turned down, on the grounds of his American citizenship.
In 1918, after an altercation caused by a defective typewriter, he was fired from the "Neue Freie Presse".
After the war.
Immediately after the war Bettauer worked as a correspondent for various New York papers, and started an aid programme in New York for the people of Vienna. From 1920 he produced novels in great quantity, publishing four or five every year. He specialised in crime stories with a social message, which were extremely popular. Another reason for the popularity of his novels was that they were not only set in Vienna but also in Berlin and New York.
"The City Without Jews".
His best-known novel was "Die Stadt ohne Juden" ("The City Without Jews") from 1922, a satire on the acutely topical subject of antisemitism. In the book, a fictional politician orders the expulsion of all Jews from Vienna. One writer noted that "in scenes that are frighteningly prophetic, Austria borrows thirty stock car trains from neighboring countries to help in the expulsion (to the east) of the Jews and their belongings." In the book, the citizens of Vienna initially celebrated the expulsion, but sentiment changed as theaters went bankrupt and department stores, hotels and resorts suffered. The economy declined to such an extent that a popular movement arose demanding the return of the Jews. Without the Jews to blame, the Nazi party collapsed; the expulsion law was repealed, and the Jews were welcomed back to Vienna.
"The City Without Jews" sold 250,000 copies in its first year, and became one of Bettauer's most controversial works, gaining him both great admirers and bitter enemies. Nazi sympathizers attacked Bettauer and his work, denouncing him as the "Red poet" and a "corruptor of youth".
Investigative journalism and other work.
Besides all this, Bettauer set up "Bettauers Wochenschrift", a weekly paper that regularly caused controversy with its progressive, not to say provocative, contents. As in the USA he exploited the concept of the serial novel.
A much shorter-lived venture was another weekly paper, "Er und Sie. Wochenschrift für Lebenskultur und Erotik" ("He and She. Weekly Paper for Lifestyle and Eroticism"), which Bettauer launched in 1924 together with R. Olden; it was closed down after five numbers.
In the course of time Bettauer's works brought him substantial returns in terms of stage and film rights, as their racy and often controversial contents made them popular for adaptation.
He was thus not only one of the most controversial, but also one of the most successful writers of his time. In the film version of "Die freudlose Gasse" (G. W. Pabst, 1925), Greta Garbo made her international screen debut, and in "Stadt ohne Juden", which was filmed in 1924 under the director Hans Karl Breslauer, both Hans Moser and Ferdinand Maierhofer made theirs.
Because of his "investigative journalism" and his stance in favour of sexual openness and liberation, Bettauer was repeatedly the object of public debate. His opponents sought to discredit him as a "gutter hack" ("Asphaltliterat"). Over time the conflict escalated: Bettauer was publicly vilified, his newspaper was confiscated, and eventually a legal action was brought against him, a side-effect of which was an outbreak of public threats and calls for his murder. Surprisingly, Bettauer was acquitted; the subsequent edition of his newspaper reached a circulation of 60,000, the highest ever among weeklies of the period; in March 1925 its expansion was being seriously considered.
Death.
The Nazis branded Bettauer a "Red poet" and "corruptor of youth", and an Austrian party member published a series of articles calling for "radical self help" and "lynch justice against all polluters of our people". On 10 March 1925, a dental technician named Otto Rothstock shot Bettauer several times. He was taken to hospital in Vienna with serious injuries and died on 26 March 1925.
Even before his death there were heated arguments, to the point of physical violence, in the "Wiener Gemeinderat" ("Vienna City Council") over the motives of the attacker. Rothstock himself maintained that he wanted to take a stand against the alleged immorality of an author who had become famous for his sexually explicit and liberal writings. However, it was established that before the attack Rothstock had been a member of the National Socialist party, and although by March 1925 he had left it again, he was nevertheless supported after Bettauer's death by lawyers and friends with close ties to the Nazis. It is generally accepted that it was Bettauer's prominent criticism of antisemitism, encapsulated in particular in the high-profile book and film "Stadt ohne Juden", that lay behind his murder. The court ordered Rothstock to be sent to a psychiatric clinic, which he left 18 months later a free man.

Bread Drink

Bread Drink () is a fermented grain beverage similar to Kvass, made in Germany from bread. The bread is baked from biodynamically grown grains. This bread is then fermented in a proprietary month long process. Then, without further processing, the liquid is bottled. Developed over the course of 20 years and finally marketed in 1981 by master baker Wilhelm Kanne, this non-alcoholic probiotic beverage is widely distributed as "Kanne Brottrunk" in Germany and in several European countries.
The drink contains live cultures ("Lactobacillus reuteri"), grain lactic acid, trace elements, minerals and vitamins (though not in noteworthy amounts). Thousands of consumers have provided anecdotal evidence of the health benefits of the bread drink.
Several books have been published with reports on the benefits that patients have experienced, such as the strengthening of the immune systems to a degree diseases could be fought off, subsided allergies, and improvements of many other conditions.
Taken internally and also applied topically, the bread drink has brought relief for eczema and psoriasis sufferers. A number of limited clinical studies have been conducted in Germany that have also indicated the positive effect of the Bread Drink on the immune system, the skin, the digestive system and other health related issues
No negative side effects have ever been reported.

Schindler disease

Schindler disease, also known as Kanzaki disease and Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency is a rare congenital metabolic disorder in humans. This lysosomal storage disorder is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-NAGA (alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase), attributable to mutations in the NAGA gene on chromosome 22, which leads to excessive lysosomal accumulation of glycoproteins. A deficiency of the alpha-NAGA enzyme leads to an accumulation of glycosphingolipids throughout the body. This accumulation of sugars gives rise to the clinical features associated with this disorder. Schindler disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that one must inherit an abnormal allele from both parents in order to have the disease. 
There are three main types of the disease each with its own distinctive symptoms. 
In the Type I infantile form, infants will develop normally until about a year old. At this time, the affected infant will begin to lose previously acquired skills involving the coordination of physical and mental behaviors. Additional neurological and neuromuscular symptoms such as diminished muscle tone, weakness, involuntary rapid eye movements, vision loss, and seizures may become present. With time, the symptoms worsen and children affected with this disorder will experience a decreased ability to move certain muscles due to muscle rigidity. The ability to respond to external stimuli will also decrease. Other symptoms include neuroaxonal dystrophy from birth, discoloration of skin, Telangiectasia or widening of blood vessels.
In Type II adult form, symptoms are milder and may not appear until the individual is in his or her 30s. Angiokeratomas, an increased coarsening of facial features, and mild intellectual impairment are likely symptoms.
Type III is considered an intermediate disorder. Symptoms vary and can include to be more severe with seizures and mental retardation, or less severe with delayed speech, a mild autistic like presentation, and/or behavioral problems.
Infants with Schindler disease tend to die within 4 years of birth, therefore, treatment for this form of the disease is mostly palliative. However, Type II Schindler disease, with its late onset of symptoms, is not characterized by neurological degeneration. There is no known cure for Schindler disease, but bone marrow transplants have been trialed, as they have been successful in curing other glycoprotein disorders.
Amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling can be used to screen for the disease before birth. After birth, urine tests, along with blood tests and skin biopsies can be used to diagnose Schindler disease. Genetic testing is also always an option, since different forms of Schindler disease have been mapped to the same gene on chromosome 22; though different changes (mutations) of this gene are responsible for the infantile- and adult-onset forms of the disease.
Schindler disease was named after Detlev Schindler (1946- ) M.D., the first author of a 1988 paper detailing the disease. It also named after the Japanese Biochemist and Physician, Hiro Kanzaki (1949- ), who further studied it and released papers detailing the disease in 2006.

Apex, Iqaluit

Apex (Inuktitut "Niaqunngut") is a small community near Iqaluit located on Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada. It is about southeast of Iqaluit on a small peninsula separating Koojesse (Kuujussi) Inlet from Tarr Inlet. Historically Apex was the place where most Inuit lived when Iqaluit was a military site and off-limits to anyone not working at the base. The community is accessed by bridge or causeway, and bordered by a local creek (kuujuusi) and waterfall (kugluktuk). Located here are the women's shelter, a church, Nanook Elementary School, and a bed-and-breakfast, along with housing for about 60 families.
Officially and functionally part of the City of Iqaluit, some Apex residents tend to reject affiliation with "Frobisher Bay". At the 2006 Nunavut Electoral Boundaries Commission hearings, and in the resulting final report, community members asked for territorial representation with the south Baffin community of Kimmirut, rather than continue with parts of the existing Iqaluit ridings. The Deputy-Mayor of Iqaluit has the additional portfolio of representing and responding to interests from the Apex citizenry.
The community got its start in 1949 when the Hudson's Bay Company moved its south Baffin operations from Ward Inlet to the Apex Beach location to take advantage of the increased activity near the new US Air Force Base and landing strip. In the 1950s the community contained a number of administrative buildings for the Department of Northern Health and Welfare, as well as Inuit housing units, a public laundry and bath house and the original nursing station for the Baffin region. This latter facility acted as a marshalling and drop-off point for treatment in tuberculosis hospitals. A momument to Inuit who went south as tuberculosis patients, and did not return, was commissioned by Pairijait Tigumivik, (the Iqaluit Elders' Society) and is located in front of the nursing station on the bank of the creek. Small holes in the monument act as a 'prayer wall' designed to permit the insertion of messages for departed relatives.
The Inuit housing units which grew up in Apex were either in the single room "match-box" style with a pinched waist (1960s), or the 512 (named for the square footage of this housing model). The original Apex families, (including the Michael, Alainga, Peter, Joamie, Onalik and Timotee families) built these houses from standard packages supplied by government. There was also a small cannery for Arctic char, promoted by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The cannery encouraged fishing at levels which lead to the demise of the Iqaluit Sylvia Grinnell River fish stocks, which are only now (~2008) showing signs of a recovery to levels which would substantiate the name "Iqaluit" for this region.
During the times of Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, Stu Hodgson, and his successor John H. Parker, residents of Apex were advised that the community was inefficient and no longer required. Plans were made for it to be "shut down" by government. A number of the Inuit housing units were moved to the airpost site at Frobisher Bay, including some which were relocated while their owners were away hunting. Government functions and employment gradually moved into the more "convenient" areas around the airport site, and the population of Apex declined. Municipal by-laws restricted new housing to existing residents until 1989, when construction was again permitted. The City of Iqaluit continues to prefer not to increase housing in Apex as it is serviced by more expensive "trucked water and sewer" systems.
Apex Hill has been used both as an alternate community name and as a geographic location for the hill on the east (seaward) side of the community which served as the apex (high point) for marine navigators entering Koojesse Inlet on the annual sealift and resupply.

<doc id="20174742" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20174742" title="Nabi Salih">
Nabi Salih

Nabi Salih () is a small Palestinian village in the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate in the central West Bank, located 20 kilometers northwest of Ramallah. It had over 530 inhabitants in 2007.
History.
In 1596 the village appeared (with the name "Dayr Salih") in the Ottoman tax registers as being in the "nahiya" of Quds in the "liwa" of Quds. It had a population of 2 households, both Muslim. Taxes were paid on wheat, barley, summer crops and occasional revenues
The French explorer Victor Guérin visited the place twice in the 19th century. In 1863 he scaled the nearby height, and in 1870 he noted that the place was named after a person who "is venerated there under a koubbeh partially constructed with regular stonework with an appearance of antiquity." In 1870 Guérin estimated that the village had 150 inhabitants, while an Ottoman village list from about the same year showed that "Nebi Salih" had 5 houses and a population of 22, though the population count included only men. In "The Survey of Western Palestine" (1882), Neby Saleh was described as "a village of moderate size on a ridge, with a small mosque and a well to the south. A spring exists about three-quarters of a mile east."
Shrine of Salih.
Local tradition identifies the blue-color-domed building complex in the village with the shrine of the prophet Salih (Biblical Shelah). The modern structure was built in the 19th-century during Ottoman rule. The building included a "zawiya", a Sufi lodging space and was guarded by a watchman. It was situated on the remains of a Crusader structure, which was presumably built atop the ruins of a Byzantine-era church. The remains of the Crusader-Byzantine structure, include apses of a three-aisle chapel located behind the shrine complex. 
The Nabi Salih shrine was the most important religious structure, out of 16 different edifices, in the Bani Zeid region. It served as a gathering place for families during two rites of passage for their young sons: collective circumcisions and first hair cuts. These events were followed by celebratory picnics and games. Coinciding with Easter Week celebrated by the local Christians, Muslims from the area would visit the Nabi Salih shrine and from there would depart for the annual procession to the Aqsa Mosque (along with the Haram ash-Sharif) and the Nabi Musa ("Prophet Moses") shrine south of Jericho. The inhabitants of the al-Salihiyah neighborhood of Damascus, who claimed descent from the Abbasids, regarded Nabi Salih as the site of their eponym and would travel there to commemorate the site. It was at Nabi Salih that hundreds of men from Deir Ghassaneh and other villages of the Bani Zeid sheikhdom would interact with the wider Arabic-speaking Muslim community from Palestine and the Levant.
In 2003, under the supervision of architect Yara al-Sharif, the complex was restored. It cost $63,000, primarily funded by Sweden. The prayer hall and tomb room are owned by the Islamic waqf authority, but is rented by the Nabi Salih Cultural Centre. Currently, the complex is composed of three floors (including an underground floor) containing the tomb, a large prayer room, an olive press, a water well, a classroom, a multipurpose hall, a double-vaulted lecture room, a courtyard and two front and back terraces. All entrances are semi-circular pointed arches. The An Nabi Salih Cultural Centre serves as the most significant structure in the village.
Weekly protests.
Nabi Salih's residents have hosted weekly demonstrations for three years in protest at the confiscation of the village's lands and the takeover of their spring by the nearby Israeli settlement, Halamish. During the protests, there are regular clashes with the Israeli Army who attempt to disperse crowds by using teargas, skunk water, rubber bullets, sound grenades, and other dispersal methods while Palestinian youth respond by hurling stones. The Israeli authorities have repressed the residents using tactics such as night incursions targeting homes and arrests of alleged stone throwers. On December 11, 2011, Mustafa Tamimi was shot in the face by a teargas canister at close range and later died from his injury, becoming the first resident of Nabi Salih to be killed during a demonstration. The following day, a large group of protesters marched to the entrance of Halamish to commemorate Tamimi, but were stopped by the Israeli Army which arrested 15 demonstrators including Palestinians, Israelis and internationals.
Bassem al-Tamimi, one of the leaders of the protests, has been arrested twelve times by Israeli forces, at one point spending more than three years in administrative detention#Israel without trial. His most recent arrest took place on March 2011, when he was charged with sending youths to throw stones, holding a march without a permit, incitement, and perverting the course of justice; an Israeli military court found him guilty of the former two charges and not guilty of the latter. His arrest drew international attention, with the European Union describing him as a "human rights defender", and Amnesty International designating him a prisoner of conscience.
On 19 November 2012 Rushdi Tamimi, a 28-year old Palestinian protester, was killed by Israeli fire during a demonstration in Nabi Salih in solidarity with the people of the Gaza Strip in light of the recent Israeli offensive against the territory, Operation Pillar of Cloud.
B'Tselem reports.
In February 2011, B'Tselem volunteers filmed Israeli soldiers coming to the homes of Arab residents, waking and photographing children. A B'Tselem report released in September 2011 accused Israel’s security forces of infringing the rights of the Palestinian demonstrators in Nabi Saleh.
On 31 August 2012 Two demonstrators at the village were injured by bullets when IDF soldiers fired warning shots in the air during a protest gathering. The IDF undertook to investigate and said that soldiers were reacting to stone-throwing.
Geography.
The village is situated at an elevation of 570 meters above sea level along the mountainous chain running down the West Bank in southern Samaria. Nabi Salih is located 20 kilometers northwest the cities of Ramallah and al-Bireh. It is adjacent of the Beit Rima part of Bani Zeid in the northwest. Other nearby localities include Kafr Ein in the north, Deir as-Sudan to the northeast, 'Abud to the west, and Deir Nidham to the southwest. 
In a 1945 land and population survey by Sami Hadawi, Nabi Salih had a total land area of 2,846 dunams, of which 2,797 was Arab-owned, the remainder public-owned. The built-up area of the village only constituted 11 dunams, while 735 dunams were planted with olive groves.
Ein al-Qaws Spring.
Near the village the is a natural spring named Ein al-Qaws ("the Bow Spring") which is owned by an individual of the village, Bashir Tamimi. In 2009 settlers from the nearby illegal settlement of Halamish took control over the spring and its surroundings and prevented Palestinian access to their land. Subsequently, people of Nabi Salih and the nearby village of Dir Nizam began regular Friday protests for the spring, and against the Israeli occupation in general.
Demographics.
The most prominent family in Nabi Salih is Tamimi. In a 1922 survey by the British Mandate of Palestine, there were 105 people living in Nabi Salih, rising to 144 in the 1931 census.
In Hadawi's survey, Nabi Salih had 170 inhabitants in 1945. In 1961, the population was 337, but decreased substantially after the Six-Day War in 1967, due to residents fleeing the site towards other Palestinian localities or Jordan. In 1982, the population reached 179.
In the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Nabi Salih had a population of 371. Palestinian refugees constituted just 4.3% of the inhabitants. According to the PCBS, the village had a population of 524 inhabitants in mid-year 2006. The 2007 PCBS census recorded a population of 534.

Peter Dennis (ecologist)

Dr Peter Dennis (born 1964) is a British Researcher and Lecturer. He specializes in Grassland Ecology and lectures in Grazing Ecology to undergraduate students attending Aberystwyth University.
His main research interests include:
Career.
Early life.
Peter Dennis attended the University of Leeds between 1982 and 1985, attaining a BSc Hons. in Agricultural Zoology. He then went on to work for four years to complete his PhD in Farmland Ecology at the University of Southampton and at the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust, Fordingbridge in 1989.
He was taken on as a research fellow at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research in the Agricultural University of Norway for a year, and in 1990 began work as a Higher Scientific Officer at the Natural Environment Research Council's (NERC's) Institute of Terrestrial Ecology in Edinburgh (Now merged to form the NERC's Centre for Ecology & Hydrology). In 1993, he moved into the northeast of Scotland and started the beginning of a lengthy career as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist with the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute (MLURI, now the Macaulay Institute) outside Aberdeen.
MLURI.
At MLURI, Peter Dennis worked as a wildlife and landscape ecologist, specialising in grazing ecology and entomology. Through this post he acted as principal investigator/scientific co-ordinator for scientific research and development projects within the department, and was involved in the dissemination of research output via journals and international conferences. He was extensively involved with the recruitment, training and supervision of support staff and research students and acted as a consultant for external contracts, for example with Scottish Natural Heritage, English Nature, National Trust for Scotland and the RSPB.
One of his projects involved a substantial contribution to the strategic development of the MI Ecology of Grazed Ecosystems research programme.
He was also an institute representative on regional and national biodiversity committees and in 2002 became a Senior Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the institute. His recent major research activity with the institute included the scientific co-ordination of the then Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department’s Grazing and Upland Bird (GRUB) project. This research addressed the long-term ecological effects of changes in upland farming, with emphasis on factors affecting the breeding success of insectivorous birds.
During his time in the northeast of Scotland, Peter Dennis became an honorary lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, assisting in the teaching of the Plant-Animal Interactions course at the School of Biological Sciences within the university, and still remains at this post today.
Life today.
Peter Dennis joined IBERS on 25 September 2006 as a Lecturer in Grazing Ecology at Aberystwyth University's Institute of Rural Sciences (now the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences, or IBERS).
On his Aberystwyth University mini-site, he states:
"My enthusiasm for natural history is an interest that arises from spending so much time in wilder areas of land and water. I believe that such wild environments should be conserved for the habitats and species they support in addition to the tremendous human benefits that arise from the continued existence of such natural areas."
His teaching responsibilities include the supervision of PhD studentships and student personal tutorials, teaching undergraduate modules contributing to conservation and agriculture courses at degree and HND level, supervision of dissertation project students and the external examination of PhD and MSc students.
Other responsibilities centre around his research role within the university, including research collaboration with the University of Wales and the NERC’s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Bangor as part of the Welsh Assembly Government funded Research and Enterprise Partnership: the Centre for Integrated Research in the Rural Environment (CIRRE). He also sits on the editorial committee for scientific journals and academic book series', where he assists with university peer review and editorial duties for scientific publications and research proposals.
Research.
Past research projects.
After thirteen years of scientific research at the Macaulay Institute, Peter Dennis has completed several key research projects. Recent major research activities included the scientific co-ordination of the Grazing and Upland Bird (GRUB) project, and contributions to the local and national Biodiversity Action Plans. He also oversaw the biological monitoring of two of the UK Environmental Change Network sites situated in Scotland, culminating in his recent contribution to the EC ALTER-Net (A Long-term Biodiversity, Ecosystem and Awareness Research Network).
He has also been involved with research projects in South Africa and in forest ecology, he has worked on a number of government forest and woodland wildlife research projects. He has been involved in the Native Woodland Discussion Group, Forestry Research Co-ordination Committee and co-authored the Habitat Action Plan on Wet and Riparian Woodland for northeast Scotland.

Bala Lake Halt railway station

Bala Lake Halt railway station in Gwynedd, Wales, was formerly a station on the Ruabon to Barmouth line.
Bala (Penybont) is the current terminus of the Bala Lake Railway, and has occupied the site of the former halt since 1976. The narrow-gauge Bala Lake Railway originally named the station Bala (Llyn Tegid) (Llyn Tegid is Welsh for "Lake Bala". The station was subsequently renamed to the current Bala (Penybont).
History.
Opened by the Great Western Railway in 1934, it closed in 1939. In 1976 the Bala Lake Railway opened its eastern terminus on the site. The Bala Lake Railway began passenger services in 1972, and opened extensions in 1973 and 1975. Bala was reached in 1976. Writing in the railway directory "Steam '81" the general manager, G H Barnes, stated: "We aim to be in Bala near Loch Cafe in 1981, distance then 5.25 miles." This was an official prediction of the further extension of the line into Bala town centre, but the work was not carried out, and the statement was not repeated in the following year's directory, "Steam '82", leaving Bala (Llyn Tegid) as the eastern terminus of the line.

Wantuck was born on 23 November 1923 in Elmira, New York. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on 6 January 1942. After basic training at the Marine barracks at Parris Island, South Carolina, he served at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, from 30 June 1942 until late in 1942.
By 5 December 1942, Private Wantuck was serving in the Solomon Islands where, on 30 June 1943, he went ashore with other Marines at Zanana beach on the island of New Georgia. For two weeks, the troops tried to dislodge the Japanese defenders farther inland near Munda while Wantuck served with the beachhead and supply depot antiaircraft defense unit.
On 17 July 1943, the Japanese mounted a major offensive at the severed and disoriented American forces. Though eventually stymied in their attempt, they managed to reach the perimeter of the beachhead and Private Wantuck's position. Using a light machine gun salvaged from the discard pile, Wantuck stuck to his position through the night. The following morning, after the Japanese offensive had been repulsed, Private Wantuck was found dead at his machine gun with evidence in front of him that he had killed 18 to 20 Japanese and had probably wounded many more.
For his gallant defense and supreme sacrifice Private Wantuck was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously.
The United States Navy high-speed transport USS "Wantuck" (APD-125), in commission from 1944 to 1957, was named for him.

George Julian Zolnay

George Julian Zolnay (Gyula Zsolnay) (July 4, 1863 - May 1, 1949) was a Hungarian and American sculptor called the "sculptor of the Confederacy".
Early years.
Zolnay was born on July 4, 1863 to Ignác (Ignatius) and Carolina Vagán Zsolnay. By 1849 his father, co-owner of the famed Zsolnay Porcelaine Manufacturer, had sold his interest and moved from Pécs, Kingdom of Hungary to Bucharest, Kingdom of Romania. Ignác served with General Józef Bem during the 1848 Hungarian War of Independence. Zolnay's birthplace is variously given as being either Bucharest or Pécs, Hungary. He grew up in Bucharest, attending the Saint Sava National College. As George's talents in the arts were noticed in his childhood, he initially wanted to become a violinist, attaining a scholarship at the Music and Drama Conservatory; his father's disapproval kept him from violin, but he did learn to appreciate art. At age twenty he assumed a brief career as a cadet in the Romanian cavalry regiments, where he modelled many military objects and individuals. At his father's wishes, he entered the civil service upon leaving the military, but decided to learn sculpting on the side. His father finally impressed by one of his sculptures, Zolnay studied and graduated from the Royal Art Academy of Bucharest where he learned under Karl Stork. He then went to Paris, France to study under William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Alexandre Falguière, as then to the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts of Vienna where he studied under Edmund von Hellmer and Carl Kundmann, and received a Grand Prix for his work. His high ranking at Vienna gave him a grant for his own art studio, and a cash allowance.
Move to the United States.
A scion of the distinguished Zsolnay family of the city of Pécs, Hungary, where their internationally famous ceramics works thrives to this very day, Zolnay came to the United States attend the Columbian Exposition in 1893 at the behest of the U.S. consul-general to Vienna. Already enjoying considerable acclaim in Europe, Zolnay had no difficulties in adjusting to life in America. He intended to return home, but became "enamored" with the United States, and chose New York City for his new home in 1894, eventually achieving American citizenship. In 1895 Zolnay was "employed to make models for the ornamentation" for the Pantheon building created for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in 1897. He became a favorite sculptor of Southerners in 1897 after he sculpted a statue of Sam Davis, a Confederate spy who was executed; as no pictures of Davis survived, Zolnay based the likeness on Davis' relatives. Zolnay's numerous creations, scattered throughout the South, earned him the sobriquet "Sculptor of the Confederacy." Among his most memorable works are memorials to Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his daughter Winnie, affectionately known as the "Daughter of the South." 
Zolnay later served as the president of the St. Louis Plastic Arts Association and director of the Chicago School of Fine Arts. In 1903 Zolnay was appointed the director of the art department of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition and in 1909 he became the director of the Art Institute at University City Missouri. He would eventually decide to move to New York City. Zolnay was one of the eight men led by Charles DeKay who founded the National Arts Club, becoming its first vice-president. He was also the president of the Saint Louis Plastic Artists Association and director of the Chicago School of Fine Arts. 
He received renown for his work for the Chicago World's Fair. At the University of Virginia he designed the pediment on an academic building, and crafted a bust of Edgar Allan Poe. He became active in Missouri, becoming the art department director of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1903, and in 1909 he became the director of the Art Institute at University City, Missouri.
In 1913 he moved his studios to Washington, D.C. Besided his sculptural activity, he also delivered lectures on Romania, illustrated with traditional Romanian music and by lantern slides, at the Smithsonian Institution and did illustration work for the two volumes of the book "The Roumanians and Their Lands" issued by the Roumanian Relief Committee of America in 1919.
He married Abbie R. Gillim November 23, 1902.
Legacy.
King Carol I of Romania awarded Zolnay the Knight's Cross of the Order of the Crown. 
The Zsolnay family have enriched the culture of the city of Pécs and added to its wealth. The artworks of successive generations can be seen everywhere from the facade of old and new houses, on roofs, on sculptures and reliefs, in shop-windows, on commemorative plaques. The sculpture of the Saracen boy decorating the fountain was made by George Zsolnay. His impact in America was even greater. Notable figures he did included a statue of Jefferson Davis at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, the Sequoyah statue at the National Statuary Hall Collection, (a commission that he inherited from Vinnie Ream after her death. Zolnay worked primarily on the face of the figure He also created the bas relief on Ream's grave monument, located in Arlington Cemetery) the statue of Tudor Vladimirescu in Târgu-Jiu, Romania and a bust of poet Grigore Alexandrescu.

Malcolm Gluck

Malcolm Gluck is a British author, broadcaster and wine columnist.
Career.
Initially an advertising copywriter for Collett Dickenson Pearce, Doyle Dane Bernbach, a founder employee of Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO and later creative director for Lintas, Gluck was for sixteen years the wine correspondent of "The Guardian" with the column "Superplonk". In addition to contributing articles for other publications, including "Harpers Magazine" he was a wine critic of "The Oldie" until 2011, and the author of 36 books about wine. Among his titles are "Superplonk", "Streetplonk", "Brave New World" and "The Great Wine Swindle", the latter declared to become his final book due to the anticipated negative reaction of people in the wine industry. He also featured in the BBC programme "Gluck, Gluck, Gluck".
Gluck has been described as a "self-styled champion of the ordinary wine drinker, fighting against the perceived snobbery and stuffiness of the wine world".
In November 2008 a survey by the wine industry consultancy firm Wine Intelligence was made public, having polled the views of more than 1,500 regular UK wine drinkers, results show that Gluck was the fifth most recognised wine critic in the UK.
Controversies.
Appearing in the Channel 4 episode of "Dispatches" titled "What's in your wine?" in 2008, Gluck stated, "Many, many wines are no better than a sort of alcoholic cola. You get artificial yeasts, enzymes, sugar, extracts, tannins, all sorts of things added", a statement widely received with outrage in the wine industry. 
Gluck's other controversial statements include, ""Terroir" is rubbish. It is complete utter balderdash from the first syllable of its pretentious and mendacious utterance to its last". In reference to his opposition to cork stoppers, Gluck has stated, "Sticking a cork made from tree bark in a wine made in 1999 is like producing a modern motor car with a starting handle", and he has declared cork taint "a serial killer of good wine".
In the book "The Great Wine Swindle", Gluck contends that the wine industry is "populated by liars, scroungers and cheats, administered by charlatans and snake-oil salesman and run on a system of misrepresentation and ritualised fraud".
Gluck has also been involved in a public disagreement with author Salman Rushdie over who is the quicker book-signer.
In January 2009, Gluck made a series of contentions on the nature of beer drinkers in the "Word of Mouth" pages of "The Guardian", in an article asserting the rising numbers of wine drinkers in Britain, stating that "beer is only drunk by losers and sadsacks, unsexy people who care nothing for their minds or their bodies," and, "are also terrible lovers, awful husbands, and untidy flatmates". The statements drew prompt responses from beer writers Roger Protz and Melissa Cole, with Gluck challenged by Cole to appear at a beer and food pairing event.
Charity work.
Gluck hosted deafblind charity Sense’s first ever blind wine auction in October 2006, guiding guests through a wide variety of wine as they tasted the drinks in total darkness. The event was held at Dans Le Noir, a London restaurant where customers eat in the dark, that is one of Sense's corporate partners.

Nabi Saleh

Nabi Saleh is an Iranian Australian businessman and commodities trader, known for his role in purchasing Gloria Jean's Coffees and taking it world wide. He also currently serves as an elder of the Hillsong Church.
Biography.
Saleh was born on the same day of the same year as Gloria Jean's co-owner Peter Irvine. He was born in Iran and grew up in various countries including India. His family background in involved in the tea business (from his mother's side). He is married to Angela with daughters Nicole and Danielle, both of whom also work for Gloria Jean's. He holds a masters degree in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics.
Saleh followed his wife-to-be Angela to Australia in 1973. Lacking local work experience, he went to Papua New Guinea to help establish tea plantations with Australian New Guinea (ANG) Holdings. He oversaw the marketing and manufacturing of tea and coffee in Papua New Guinea and continues to consult with the Australian and PNG governments.
From 1978, Saleh developed Asco, a medium-sized coffee company from revenues of $250,000 to $15 million. Asco was then acquired by Burns Philp. He then started "Columbia Coffee and Tea" in 1983, "Tea and Coffee Traders" in 1986, and in 1989 established "Maranatha Import Exports", representing ConAgra Foods in Australia. Maranatha supplied supermarket chains Woolworths, Coles, Franklins and David's Holdings.
Saleh also worked for Traveland International, where he was responsible for the procurement of hotel rooms on a worldwide basis.
In 1995, he purcahsed Gloria Jean's Coffees and a year later he formed "Jireh International Pty Ltd", which now holds the global rights to Gloria Jeans franchising.
Saleh became a Christian in 1978 at a Kenneth Copeland convention, is a Pentecostal Christan, and is a board member of Hillsong Church.
Gloria Jean's history.
The Gloria Jean’s Coffees story began in 1979 in a small town just north of Chicago, USA where the company’s namesake, Gloria Jean Kvetko and her husband Ed saw the opportunity to offer specialty gourmet coffees in a warm and friendly atmosphere. With appreciation for quality coffee growing, the concept became a success and Gloria Jean’s Coffees outlets opened around the USA.
In 1993 Gloria Jean and Ed sold the franchise for an estimated US$40 million and the company began its expansion offshore – a journey that would later take a remarkable turn to make the company an Australian success story.
In 1995, Nabi Saleh, an Australian businessman internationally regarded for his coffee knowledge and expertise, visited the USA to experience the Gloria Jean’s Coffees brand first hand. Nabi and his business partner Peter Irvine subsequently bought the Master Franchise for Australia and the first Australian Gloria Jean’s Coffees store was opened in Miranda, Sydney in 1996.
By 2004 Gloria Jean’s Coffees had opened more than 200 coffee houses across Australia and became a national brand with coffee houses present in every Australian state and territory. With success accomplished at home, Nabi and Peter set their sights on achieving their vision to make Gloria Jean’s Coffees the most loved and respected coffee house in the world.
At the end of 2004, Nabi and Peter had purchased the international branding and roasting rights for all countries outside of the U.S. making Gloria Jean’s Coffees an Australian owned global brand overnight.
Four years later, the story has come full circle. In early 2009 Gloria Jean’s Coffees International affiliate company, Praise International North America Inc, completed negotiations to buy Gloria Jean’s Coffees U.S. retail and franchise operations, consisting of 102 coffee houses in 24 states, from its current U.S. owner.
Today, Gloria Jean’s Coffees has opened 1050 coffee houses in 48 markets all over the world.

Transient friction loading

Transient friction loading, also known as TFL, is the mechanical stress induced on an object due to transient or vibrational frictional forces.
Examples.
A classic example of TFL is the wooden block sliding over an unlevel, non-planar surface. Due to the transient response of the contact force, the resultant frictional force is noisy. The induced stress is concisely described as TFL.
Another example of TFL is the internal stresses on a hydraulic ram operating in a vibrational environment. Due to the oscilliatory nature of the acceleration experienced by the ram, in n-dimensions, the resulting frictional response is described as transient friction loading.

Jacob Hespeler

Jacob Hespeler (1810 in Ehningen, Württemberg – March 22, 1881 in Hespeler, Ontario) was a prominent businessman in Canada West and the founder of the town of Hespeler (since 1973 a part of Cambridge, Ontario).
Early life.
Born Jakob Hespeler in Ehningen in the Kingdom of Württemberg, Hespeler was the eldest son of Johann Georg Hespeler (born 1784) and Anna Barbara Wick (1791–1881). His mother was a granddaughter of Count Károly Andrássy de Csíkszentkirály et Krasznahorka (1723–1795), a Hungarian nobleman. His father was a businessman with the house of Mayer Amschel Rothschild.
Hespeler received his education in Nancy and moved to North America where he worked in the fur trade for several years, working first for John Jacob Astor in Chicago and then with the Hudson's Bay Company.
Business activities in Preston.
Around 1835 Hespeler settled in Preston, Upper Canada (now part of Cambridge, Ontario), which was then a major German-speaking centre and a focus for German-speaking immigrants from both Europe and Pennsylvania.
Hespeler began as a co-owner of a store, which he soon owned outright, and then expanded his business operations in town. He purchased a site along the Grand River intending to build a mill which would compete with the existing mill owned by the Erb family. After beginning the digging of the millrace, he was forced to abandon the project as he could not secure the necessary water rights from the Erbs. He instead bought up some land on King Street in Preston and built a grist mill, general store, and distillery. He held a number of public positions in Preston, serving as reeve, postmaster, and town councillor.
Development of New Hope / Hespeler.
Beginning on February 6, 1845, Hespeler made a series of purchases of land on the west bank of the Speed River northeast of Preston, near a small settlement called New Hope, further removed from competition with the Erbs. He greatly enlarged the existing dam on the Speed, and within the next five years erected a gristmill, a sawmill, a cooperage, and a distillery. He also built stone lodgings for single men working in his buildings, and made significant donations to both the local Catholic and Lutheran churches.
His distillery was unusual in Canada at the time in making use of the "German method" for producing vinegar, which allowed vinegar to be fermented through a chemical process much faster than traditional methods. 
In 1851 Hespeler sent a vinegar sample to The Great Exhibition in Hyde Park and subsequently began exporting vinegar to Britain regularly.
In 1857 he organized a census of New Hope with the aim of seeing it incorporated, and the settlement of New Hope was proclaimed the "Village of Hespeler" in his honour effective January 1, 1859. He was elected as the first reeve of the village, serving from 1859 to 1862.
Later years.
In 1861 Hespeler ran for election to the 7th Parliament of the Province of Canada as the Conservative candidate for South Waterloo, but was defeated by the Liberal James Cowan.
Around 1861 he sold his properties in Preston and erected a large stone woollen mill in Hespeler near the Speed River. After this mill was severely burned in 1869, Hespeler retired to California for several years before returning to Hespeler, where he died in 1881.
One of his younger brothers, William, became a prominent Manitoba politician. His daughter Laura married John Walker, a prominent industrialist who served as a member of the House of Commons.
A high school has been built in his honour, Jacob Hespeler Secondary School in Cambridge, Ontario.

St. Columba's Chapel (Middletown, Rhode Island)

St. Columba's Chapel in Middletown, Rhode Island, is a parish church of the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island of the Episcopal Church. The church is located at 55 Vaucluse Avenue, Middletown, Rhode Island. The chapel is named for the Irish-born missionary St. Columba, renowned for his teaching, healing, and miracles in sixth-century Scotland.
History.
Eugene Sturtevant and his wife, Mary Clark Sturtevant, daughter of Thomas March Clark, Bishop of Rhode Island and later presiding Episcopal Bishop of the U.S, donated an acre of land in 1882 for a chapel to serve the neighboring community. The church was originally known as The Berkeley Memorial Chapel in honor of Bishop George Berkeley of Derry. The cornerstone of the chapel was laid on October 11, 1884. The first service was held on June 23, 1885, even though the chapel was not complete. The chapel was consecrated on August 31, 1886, as a mission of the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island by Bishop Clark.
In its early history, the chapel had a close association with Saint George’s School in Middletown. Many of the ordained teachers officiated at services, and before the school’s own chapel was built, boys walked to St. Columba’s for Sunday worship.
The chapel contains a collection of eleven stained-glass windows, ten by David Maitland Armstrong, executed by Tiffany Studio. The eleventh window, by an unknown artist, was donated by actor Edwin Booth, brother of John Wilkes Booth, and his daughter, Edwina, in memory of Edwina's mother, Mary Devlin. The churchyard is distinguished by an English lychgate.

List of Baltimore Orioles Opening Day starting pitchers

The Baltimore Orioles are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Baltimore, Maryland. They play in the American League East division. The Orioles started playing in Baltimore in 1954, after moving from St. Louis, where they were known as the St. Louis Browns. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Orioles have used 33 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 60 seasons since moving to Baltimore. The 33 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 22 wins, 18 losses and 17 no decisions. No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game. 
The first Opening Day for the Orioles was played in Detroit against the Detroit Tigers on April 13, 1954. Don Larsen was the Orioles' Opening Day starting pitcher that day, in a game the Orioles lost 3–0. Jim Palmer and Mike Mussina have made the most Opening Day starts for the Baltimore Orioles, with six apiece. Palmer has a record of five wins and one loss in his Opening Day starts, and Mussina has a record of three wins, two losses and one no decision. Dave McNally made five Opening Day starts for the Orioles, with a record of three wins and no losses. Other Oriole pitchers who have made multiple Opening Day starts are Steve Barber, Rodrigo López, and Jeremy Guthrie, with three apiece, and Milt Pappas, Dennis Martínez, Mike Flanagan, Mike Boddicker, and Rick Sutcliffe, with two apiece. Flanagan's two Opening Day starts occurred eight years apart, in 1978 and 1986.
Palmer has the most Opening Day wins for the Orioles, with five. McNally's record of three wins and no losses in Opening Day starts gave him a 1.000 winning percentage, the highest in Orioles history. Flanagan's record of no wins and two losses is the lowest winning percentage of any Orioles' Opening Day starting pitcher. Flanagan and Mussina are the only pitchers to have two losses for the Orioles in Opening Day starts.
The Orioles have played in two home ballparks. Memorial Stadium was their home park until 1991, and Camden Yards has been their home park since 1992. Orioles' Opening Day starting pitchers had a record of eight wins, eight losses and eight no decisions in 24 Opening Day starts in Memorial Stadium. They have a record of ten wins, four losses and two no decisions in 15 Opening Day starts at Camden Yards. This makes their aggregate record in Opening Day starts at home 18 wins, 12 losses and 10 no decisions. Their record in Opening Day starts on the road is four wins, six losses and seven no decisions, for an aggregate Opening Day record of 22 wins, 18 losses and 16 no decisions. The Orioles played in the World Series in 1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979 and 1983, winning in 1966, 1970 and 1983. Their Opening Day starting pitchers in those years were Steve Barber (1966), Dave McNally (1969, 1970 and 1971), Jim Palmer (1979) and Dennis Martínez (1983).

Tropoxane

Tropoxane is an aryloxytropane derivative drug developed by Organix Inc., which acts as a stimulant and potent dopamine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It is an analogue of dichloropane where the amine nitrogen has been replaced by an oxygen ether link (at the bridgehead position), demonstrating that the amine nitrogen is not required for DAT binding and reuptake inhibition.
P. Meltzer, "et al." made some 8-thiabicyclo(3.2.1)octanes recently (2007).
For SAR purposes, a table has been included that lists some of these compounds.
It had been hypothesized that transporter binding of the tropanes might include ionic bonding of the central tropane nitrogen. But it turned out that at this site neither ionic nor hydrogen bonding is a prerequisite for potent monoamine reuptake inhibition. Oxa- and thia-analogs of RTI-111 are potent inhibitors, and even an "N"-replacement by methylene holds the potency within the same magnitude. However, "N"-quaternisation ("N"-dimethyl) considerably reduces DAT affinity.

Rahr West Art Museum

The Rahr West Art Museum is an art museum on U.S. Route 10 in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. It is located in the Joseph Vilas, Jr. House, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is a significant example of Queen Anne Style architecture.
House.
The house was built for Joseph Vilas (1832-1905) and his wife Mary (1837-1901) at a cost of $35,000. Joseph Vilas was a merchant and twice the mayor of Manitowoc. The 13-room house was designed by George Ferry and Alfred Clas right before they designed the Pabst Mansion in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The house sat vacant from Vilas' death in 1905 until Rahr Malting President Reinhardt Rahr purchased it in 1910. His widow donated the house to the city of Manitowoc in 1941 to use as a museum.
Rooms.
In the house's first floor, the open carriageway entrance was enclosed in 1975. During a 1950 renovation, a modern stained glass entrance was added. It leads to a room which used to consist of two rooms - reception hall and a dining room. A fireplace partition was removed in 1950 to create the single room. The Rahr parlor was used for exhibitions for around 20 years until 1977, when it was restored to its 1910 appearance. The walls are covered in silk and bordered rug and it is furnished with original furniture. The room contains a family photograph and a bronze bust by Reinhardt Rahr. One of six remaining original fireplaces is located in the room, and it contains fluted columns, floral swags, and dentils. An oval mirror is located above it. Three adjacent rooms are used to display art.
The John P. Nash memorial library is located at the top of the stairwell on the house's second floor. Originally a bedchamber, the room was renovated in 1995 by donations from Nash's family. The room contains a bay window, mantel, and a marbel wash basin behind a paneled door. The Schwartz Ivories Room was once a dressing or servant's room. It now contains the Simon Schwartz Collection of Chinese Ivories, which was donated to the museum in 1973. The collection contains items from over 300 years of history including over 40 rare pieces. The Porcelain Room houses a collection of hand-painted porcelain sculptures created by Boehm Studios. Mrs. Guido Rahr's collection of dolls are displayed in the Doll Room. They were acquired in her travels around the world. The items are ceremonial, folklore, and popular figures from their country. Furnished dollhouses in the room were donated by Amy Brady. The dollhouses contain 1930s furnishings from Marshall Fields. The Doll Room also contains the furnishings from a Victorian dining room. The Kamogawa Room contains a collection of gifts from Manitowoc's Japanese sister city Kamogawa.
A wing was added to the house in 1975 to hold exhibits. The wing was paid for with donations from John and Ruth West and the Rahr Foundation. Another wing was added in 1986 to display and store a permanent collection of American art donated by the Wests.
The galleries at the museum have held pieces by Georgia O'Keeffe, Andy Warhol, and Picasso. The Courtyard Garden, located just inside the museum entrance, was established in 1975 by Mrs. John West and the Manitowoc Garden Club. It contains a bronze sculpture by Bruno Lucchesi in Wisconsin shrubs and trees. The Ruth West Gallery, the largest exhibition space, is used for around 10 exhibitions per year. It sometimes host lectures and recitals. The John West Gallery has exhibitions that changes every four to six weeks. It is sometimes used to display art of the museum's collection.
Sputnikfest.
On September 5, 1962, a piece of the 7 ton Sputnik 4 crashed on North Eighth Street east of the museum. The impact location is marked with a ring. A cast was made from the original piece before the Soviets claimed it, and the cast was displayed at the museum. A customer in a nearby art gallery jokingly suggested that the city should hold a festival to celebrate the crash. The city held the first Sputnikfest in 2008, which was organized by the head of both museums.

Wayne Morse Farm

The Wayne Morse Family Farm was the home of Oregon’s long-time United States Senator, Wayne Morse. It is located in Eugene, Oregon. The site was originally a working farm called "Edgewood Farm" by the Morse family. It includes the Morse home, a natural wooded area, and open meadow. Formerly named Morse Ranch, the park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Wayne Morse.
Wayne Lyman Morse was a law professor and independent-minded politician from Oregon. He was born in Wisconsin, but moved to Eugene in 1930, where he taught law at the University of Oregon. In 1944, Morse was elected to the United States Senate as a Republican. In 1952, he left the Republican Party, becoming an Independent. Three years later, Morse joined the Democratic Party. Morse continued to serve in the Senate until 1968. He died in Portland, Oregon in 1974.
Morse house.
The Morse house was built in 1936. It is a colonial revival style home designed by Wallace Hayden. The house is a standard wood-frame structure with shingle siding on a concrete foundation. The interior is furnished with period furniture from the 1930s and 1940s that help preserve the historic integrity of the home. Morse memorabilia is also on display in the house. This includes a large collection of copies of political cartoons featuring Wayne Morse, which were donated to him by the artists. The original collection is maintained by the Oregon Historical Society in Portland. Because of its importance to the political history of Oregon, the Morse house and surrounding park was list on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
The historic house is open to the public by appointment and can be rented for special events such as business meeting, weddings, and reunions. However, the size of the home requires that groups be limited to 30 people. The Wayne Morse Historical Park Corporation works with the City of Eugene to preserve the Morse house and park. Members of the group give tours, organize events, and maintain the Morse collection exhibits.
Morse Family Farm.
In addition to the house, the park includes a natural wooded area and meadow land. Originally, it was a working farm the Morse family called "Edgewood Farm." Today, it is a City of Eugene park with open space, restrooms, picnic tables, and a large picnic shelter which is available for rent from May through October. When the shelter is not reserved, it is open to the public.
The park grounds are open daily from dawn until 9:30 pm Nature walks are a popular attraction. Dogs are permitted in the fenced off-leash dog exercise area. In the summer, the City of Eugene operates a day camp in the park. The Willamette Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, which is not affiliated with the Wayne Morse Family Farm, is also located on the grounds of the park. The center rehabilitates injured birds and small animals.

Center for China in the World Economy

The Center for China in the World Economy (CCWE) is an international political economic policy research center and think tank located in the School of Economics and Management (SEM) at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. The Center was founded in September 2004 and formally launched in October 2005 under the notion that "improving understanding of China's evolving prominence in the world will be of key importance both in China itself and abroad for many years to come". CCWE's founding partner is BP-China.
The center serves in a unique capacity as a liaison between both West and East, private and public. More specifically, the center is able to interface with both China's burgeoning market economy and its public policy makers in order to disseminate strategic policy and accurately forecast the developing role and identity of the Chinese state in the global economy. Moreover, its leadership is composed of academics with experience and expertise gained and formed in both the world's leading institutions. Operating in China's top university, the center hopes to increase its role as an elite source of information concerning China's development and growth in the 21st century. 
History
The seminal period for the center occurred from October 2003 to July 2004 when "over one hundred of the world's leading economic experts" were consulted regarding establishment. Following positive feedback, recruiting of research and administrative staff began. In September 2004, Tsinghua University formally approved the founding of the center. In February 2005, the center's executive committee was formed, holding its first meeting on 3 March of that year. In October 2005, the CCWE advisory board held its first meeting immediately preceding the first publication of the center's journal, "China and World Affairs". In late October, the Center's new office location within the School of Economics and Management (SEM) became ready for use, and the formal launch of the center with its founding partner BP-China was held on October 31, 2005.
Activities
The CCWE is primarily focuses on in-depth research on China's economic development and reform. Research interests include comparative institutional, macroeconomic, and political economic strategy policy understandings, forecasts, and recommendations. Such research is promulgated via the Center's quarterly journal, working papers, and monthly bulletin publications. 
Further involvement in the international academic community include the hosting of the "China in the World Economy Public Lecture Series", Policy Briefing Sessions (PBS), Roundtables, the China Policy Update, international conferences, and various workshops. CCWE has also participated in IMF and World Bank forums and conferences. 
Recent conferences hosted by the CCWE have centered on topics such as the Sichuan Earthquake and the Global Financial Crisis.
China and World Affairs
The main activity of the center concerns the quarterly publication of the academic journal, China and World Affairs, which was first published in October 2005. Edited and published within the CCWE by a team of professors, graduate students, editors, and staff; China and World Affairs is a policy journal primarily concerned with disseminating and proposing strategic policy as regards China's emergence onto the global stage since economic reform began in the late 1970s. 
The journal is composed of both Chinese and English articles. Hence, the center has both Chinese and English editing teams and submission procedures for both types of articles. Since its inception, the journal has expanded both the size of its publication as well as the amount of English articles included. Since the autumn of 2008, each journal edition focuses on approximately four key issues under which included articles are organized under. Articles are published by a host of academics mainly from within China and from universities including Tsinghua University, Peking University, Fudan University, University of Hong Kong, Nankai University, Renmin University, and many other key universities located in Beijing and elsewhere. Published articles also include those written by military personnel and government officials.

Lucy Redler

Lucy Redler (born August 17, 1979 in Hann. Münden, Lower Saxony) is a German politician, Socialist Alternative activist, and member of the Left Party. From 2005 to 2007 Redler served on the executive committee of the Berlin section of the Labor and Social Justice List (WASG), and she was its chief candidate in the 2006 Berlin state elections. The German media has given Redler the nickname "Red Lucy".
Early life.
Redler was born on August 17, 1979, in Hann. Münden near Kassel in Lower Saxony. She is the daughter of a social worker and a pediatric nurse. She first became active in politics through antifascist demonstrations. At the age of 15, she became involved with the group Youth against Racism in Europe, which was organized by the Trotskyist group Socialist Alternative (SAV) and other sections of the CWI. She studied political economy at the Hamburg University for Economy and Politics.
Political career.
Remaining in Hamburg following her graduation, she became a local spokesperson for "Youth against War", an anti-Iraq War group close to the SAV. In the 2002 German federal elections, Redler ran in a Hamburg district as an SAV candidate for the Bundestag. In the 2004 Hamburg state election, she ran on the electoral list of "Regenbogen" ("Rainbow"), which was a local electoral alliance of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), Communist Party (DKP) and SAV. 
In 2005 Redler moved to Berlin and became editor of the SAV newspaper, "Solidarität". In November of that year, she was elected to the executive committee of the WASG's Berlin section. She then ran as the head candidate of the WASG in the September 2006 Berlin state elections. The Berlin WASG campaign was controversial, since its candidates directly challenged the slate of the PDS, which was allied with the WASG. Redler openly criticized the role of PDS politicians as participants in the state government. In November 2006 she was elected to the National Committee of the WASG; however, seven months later the organization voted to merge with the PDS and form the Left Party. 
Critical of the terms of the WASG-PDS merger, Redler initially attempted to organize a group that was autonomous from the Left Party in Berlin, known as the Berlin Alternative for Solidarity and Justice (BASG). However, in September 2008, the SAV instructed its East German and Berlin members to join the Left Party. Redler applied for membership in the party, which fueled controversy because of her past activities. The issue even appeared in the pages of major newspapers, such as "Der Spiegel", "Die Welt" and the "Berliner Morgenpost". Because of opposition from some leaders of the Left Party, she was not accepted as a member of the party until August 2010.

Siamese revolution of 1932

The Siamese Revolution of 1932 or the Siamese Coup d'état of 1932 ( or ) was a crucial turning point in Thai history in the 20th century. The revolution or more accurately the coup d'état was a nearly bloodless transition on 24 June 1932, in which the system of government in Siam was changed from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy. The revolution was brought about by a comparatively small group of military and civilians, who formed Siam's first political party, Khana Ratsadon (Peoples' Party). The revolution ended 150 years of absolutism under the Chakri Dynasty and almost 700 years of absolute rule of Kings over Thai history. The Revolution was a product of global historical change as well as social and political changes domestically. The revolution also resulted in the people of Siam being granted their first Constitution.
The academic discourse on pre-1932 Siam.
Conventional perspectives.
Unlike other modern Southeast Asian states, Thailand was never formally colonised by any colonial powers. Conventional perspectives attribute this achievement to the efforts made by the monarchs of the Chakri Dynasty, particularly Rama IV and Rama V, to 'modernise' the Siamese polity, and also to the relative cultural and ethnic homogeneity of the Thai nation. Rama IV (King Mongkut) was credited with opening up Siam to European trade and starting the process of 'modernisation'. Rama V (King Chulalongkorn) consolidated state control over his vassal states and created an absolute monarchy and a centralised state. The success of the Chakri monarchs, however, also sowed the seeds for the 1932 Revolution and the end of absolute monarchy. The 'modernisation' from above created in the early 20th century a class of Western-educated elite (not necessarily rooted in democratic values, with some leaning toward authoritarian) in the Thai commoner and lower nobility classes, who were influenced by the ideals of the French and Russian Revolutions and staffed the middle and lower ranks of the nascent Siamese bureaucracy. This new elite would eventually form the People’s Party that was the nucleus of the 1932 Revolution.
Alternative perspectives.
Recent scholarship has begun to raise new alternative perspectives to modern Thai history that challenges the conventional perspectives of the 1932 Siamese Revolution. One of the most influential contemporary scholars on Thailand is Thongchai Winichakul. His hypothesis on the emergence of the modern Thai geobody is widely accepted by scholars in Thai and Southeast Asian studies. He argues that the traditional Hindu-Buddhist paradigms of culture, space, governance and power were being challenged by a significantly different civilization that mainly arose from Latin Christianity tempered by Humanism of the Enlightenment. The rising power and confidence in Europe saw a corresponding increase in Western chauvinism. The East now became increasingly caricaturised as 'barbaric', ‘naïve’, 'childish' and 'inferior'. The mission to 'civilise' these 'barbaric Asiatics' became the raison d'être for colonialism and imperialism. The "siwilai" or "civilise" discourse that arose in nineteenth century Siam was in fact was part of a crucial strategy adopted by the Siamese government to justify the continued existence as a legitimate independent state and to fend off any excuse or colonial intervention. Other components involved the spatial and political reorganisation of the Siamese polity along the new Western paradigms to strengthen the Siamese state and gain recognition from the Western powers as a 'modern' state. Thongchai further argues that the key strategies adopted by the Siamese state to make Siam "siwilai" were quite similar to those adopted by Western colonial powers in administering their colonies. Space and power were essentially redefined by the Siamese state. Autonomous and semi-autonomous "muangs" were brought under the direct control of the Siamese state by the beginning of the twentieth century. Cartography was introduced to define the borders of Siam, instead of the vague frontiers of the Mandala polities. People were classified into different ethnic groups. In an attempt to promote the new ‘Western’- inspired definitions of being “siwilaí”, the Siamese elite of the 19th century, mainly the aristocracy, began writing ethnographies and create their own versions of the 'Other' to strengthen the identity of the newly created Siamese 'nation' by emphasising its own 'superior' status in relation to the 'barbarity' of the upland peoples like the Lue and the Lahu.
These new perspectives raise the image of a politically dominant Siamese aristocracy that became increasingly powerful from the ‘modernisation’/‘self-colonisation’ process it initiated and directed. This seems contradictory to conventional perspectives. Conventional perspectives are based on the assumption that the Chakri absolute monarchy by the early 1930s was a relatively passive actor, due to the weaknesses of Rama VI (King Vajiravudh) and Rama VII (King Prajadhipok) and crises such as the Great Depression, and could no longer control events and political developments in Siam and was thus swept aside by young activists who advocated democracy and nationalism. Revisionist proponents point out that the weaknesses of individual monarchs does not necessarily mean the resolve and power of the traditional landed aristocracy or the so-called "Sakdina" aristocracy in maintaining its preeminence through upholding the political prerogatives of the absolute monarchy was in any way lessened. From their viewpoint, attributing the outbreak of the 1932 Revolution largely to the beliefs and ambitions of the Western-educated Promoters of the People's Party has obscured the role played by the Siamese monarchy and aristocracy.
Siam before 1932.
Since the year 1782 the Kingdom of Siam was ruled by the House of Chakri, founded by King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (or Rama I). The capital city, Bangkok (built on Rattanakosin Island), was also founded by King Rama I. For over a century, the Kings of Siam were able to protect the nation from neighbours (such as Burma) and other foreign nations, escaping colonialism from European powers such as Britain and France. In 1932 Siam, together with China and Japan, were the only independent countries remaining in East Asia.
King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) came to the throne in 1868, eager to modernize and reform his medieval kingdom, and he introduced many new reforms and inventions to his country. He openly embraced Europeans as well as European thought on many matters, chiefly law, politics, philosophy, commercialism, education and medicine. He reformed the administration as well as the military system. At the same time he successfully maintained the country's fragile independence, being situated between prolific colonialists: the British Raj (Burma) and French Indochina (Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia). The King, who understood the importance of foreign education, not only sent his many sons to European schools and academies, but also sent thousands of commoners and scholarship students, anticipating that the Kingdom's survival rested on modernization.
He was succeeded to the throne by his son, King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) (1910–25), a Sandhurst and Oxford graduate. Vajiravudh continued most of his father's efforts in modernizing the infrastructure and other institutions of the country, including appointing able commoners to the government. The foundation of the Vajiravudh College (a school founded on the model of an English public school) and Chulalongkorn University (Siam's first) were part of his educational reforms. He also encouraged more European practices such as fashion and the adoption by all of surnames. His reforms resulted in much anger in many quarters, especially from older, reactionary members of the aristocracy and nobility, whose influence was slowly being eroded. However, the speed of his constitutional reforms also resulted in dissatisfaction from an entirely different faction: the progressive and radicals.
In 1912, a Palace revolt, plotted by young military officers, tried unsuccessfully to overthrow and replace the King. Their goals were to change the system of government, overthrowing the ancien régime and replacing it with a modern, Westernized constitutional system, and perhaps to replace Rama VI with a prince more sympathetic to their beliefs. The revolt failed and the participants were imprisoned. In reaction, Vajiravudh largely abandoned his attempts at constitutional reform and continued with his absolutist rule, with the minor exception of appointing some able commoners into his Privy Council and Government. King Vajiravudh died in 1925, and was succeed by his younger brother King Prajadhipok (Rama VII).
Siam in 1932.
Prince Prajadhipok Sakdidej, the Prince of Sukhothai, was the youngest son of King Chulalongkorn (the 33rd son and the 76th child out of 77th children), an Eton and Woolwich Academy educated Prince. King Prajadhipok inherited a country in crisis, His brother Vajiravudh had left the state on the verge of bankruptcy, often using the Treasury to cover-up the many deficits of the Privy Purse, and the fact that the state and the people were forced to subsidize the many Princes and their lavish lifestyles.
After his coronation, the new King quickly created the Supreme Council of State (which became the main organ of state), to try to solve the many problems facing the nation. The Council was composed of experienced senior princes who had held ministerial positions in previous administrations. Unfortunately, they were quick to replace commoners appointed by Vajiravudh in the civil service and military with many of their own. The Council was dominated by the Minister of the Interior, German-educated Prince Paribatra Sukhumbhand, Prince of Nakhon Sawan, who was Prajadhipok's older half brother. Due to the complicated succession law of the Chakri Dynasty, he was also heir to the throne. Prajadhipok turned out to be a very sympathetic monarch. He immediately ordered a cut in Palace expenditure and travelled extensively around the country to learn the situations first hand. He made himself more accessible and visible to the ever-growing Bangkok elite and middle class by carrying out many public duties. By this time, many students sent to study abroad decades earlier had started to return. Faced with the lack of opportunity, the entrenchment of the Princes, and the comparative backwardness of the country, most became disillusioned with the status quo.
By 1930, however, the events of the world were too much for the Kingdom to bear, as the Wall Street Crash and the economic meltdown that came with it finally reached Siam. The King proposed the levying of general income taxes and property taxes to help elevate the sufferings of the poor. However, these were roundly rejected by the Council, who feared their own fortunes would be reduced. Instead, they cut civil service pay rolls and reduced the military budget, angering most of the country's educated elite. The officer corps was especially discontented, and in 1931 Phra Ong Chao (lower class of Prince) Boworadet, a minor member of the Royal Family and Minister of Defence, resigned. Prince Boworadet was not a member of the Supreme Council, and it was suspected that disagreement with the council over budget cuts and jealously led to his resignation. The King, who openly confessed his own lack of financial knowledge, stating he was just a simple soldier, tried with little success to battle the senior princes over this issue.
Meanwhile, the King put his efforts into the drafting of a constitution (which for the first time was to introduce democracy to Siam), with the help of two princes and an American foreign policy advisor, Raymond Bartlett Stevens. Despite being advised that his people were not yet ready for democracy, the King was undeterred and was determined to grant a constitution before his Dynasty's 150 anniversary in 1932. However, the document was completely rejected by the princes in the Supreme Council.
On 6 April 1932, when the Chakri Dynasty celebrated its 150 anniversary of rule over Siam, the King opened a bridge across the Chao Phraya River. The celebration was somewhat muted due to fears stemming from an alleged prophecy dating back to the days of King Rama I, which predicted the end of the dynasty on its 150th anniversary. By the end of April, Prajadhipok had left Bangkok for his summer holidays, leaving Prince Paribatra in charge as regent. The King went to the beach resort town of Hua Hin in Prachuap Khiri Khan province to his summer villa, "Klai Kangwon" (วังไกลกังวล: translated as "Far from Worries").
Causes of the 1932 Siamese Revolution.
Conventional perspectives.
Thai political history is perhaps one of the least researched by Western Southeast Asian scholars in the 1950s and 1960s. Thailand, as the only nominally 'native' Southeast Asian polity to escape colonial conquest, was deemed to be relatively more stable than compared to other newly independent states in Southeast Asia. It was perceived to have retained enough continuity from its 'tradition', such as the institution of the monarchy, to have 'escaped' from the chaos and troubles caused by decolonisation and to resist the encroachment of revolutionary Communism. By implication, this line of argument suggests the 1932 Revolution was nothing more than a 'coup' that simply replaced the absolute monarchy and its aristocracy with a 'commoner' elite class made up of Western educated generals and civilian bureaucrats and essentially that there was little that was revolutionary about this event. David K. Wyatt for instance described the period of Thai history from 1910 to 1941 as “essentially the political working out of the social consequences of the reforms of Chulalongkorn's reign”. The 1932 revolution was generally characterised as the ‘inevitable’ outcome of “natural consequences of forces set in motion by Rama IV and Rama V.
Effects of Rama VI’s (King Vajiravudh) mismanagement.
Rama VI was the first Chakri monarch to be educated overseas in Great Britain and he basically sought to legitimise absolutism through the promotion of Thai nationalism, using a secular and western approach. He was determined to maintain the absolute monarchy and carried out many unpopular policies and decisions that lowered the prestige and influence of the Chakri dynasty. He was blamed for the rapid deterioration of the Siamese government’s fiscal health. His lavish spending on his court, his inability to control the corruption of his inner circle and his creation of the Wild Tiger Corps to promote modern-style Siamese nationalism was widely deemed as wasteful and unproductive. By 1920, fiscal mismanagement under Rama VI and the global economic downturn took the Siamese state budget into deficit. In 1925, even the most senior princes decided to demand large cuts in expenditures, especially the royal household. This represented a bold challenge to the authority of the absolute monarch and reflected the severity of the fiscal malaise in Siam.
His creation of the paramilitary Wild Tiger Corps alienated many regular military officers, who resented the privileges granted to the Corps while their own political and economic interests were being 'neglected'. Rama VI also caused resentment among the aristocracy, since he surrounded himself with commoner courtiers instead of high ranking nobles. The critique was thus that Rama VI was not a competent absolute monarch, and he squandered the massive political capital that he inherited from his father, Rama V, setting the stage for the 1932 revolution, in which disgruntled military officers and bureaucrats seized power.
Rise of the Western-educated 'commoner' elites.
'Modern' or Western education was instituted in the reign of Rama V. Although this was still largely limited to the Siamese nobility and the wealthy, new avenues of social mobility was now available to commoners and members of the lower nobility. The best example of these commoner beneiciaries is Pibul Songkram who was from a peasant background. Many of the brightest Siamese students, both commoners and the nobility, were sent abroad to study in Europe. These include Pridi Banomyong, who was of Sino-Thai descent, and Prayoon Panornmontri, the half-German son of a junior Thai official at the Siamese legation in Berlin and later a page to the Crown Prince (who would become Rama VI). They were to become prominent members of the Promoters. These Western-educated 'Commoner' elites were exposed not just to the latest scientific and technical knowledge in Europe but also to the ideals of Western democracy, Nationalism and Communism.
But during the reign of Rama VII (King Prajadhipok), the high-ranking Chakri princes had regained dominance of the government and only four of the twelve ministries were administered by commoners or members of the lower nobility. This 'royal' government was struggling with the fiscal malaise created by Rama VI's administration, and the situation was made much worse by the onset of the Great Depression. Subsequent government measures to lay off many low-ranking bureaucrats and soldiers and reduce the pay of those still in government service caused great resentment among the 'commoner' elites, who were the ones most greatly affected, particularly when the high nobility continue to enjoy considerable wealth and privileges accorded to them by the absolute monarchical system. The resulting unhappiness at the status quo due to the awareness of the ideals of Western democracy, Nationalism and Communism, coupled with the mismanagement by the absolute monarchy and the deteriorating economic conditions caused by the Great Depression triggered the 1932 Revolution. The onus of the outbreak of the 1932 Revolution from this perspective thus lies with the disgruntled 'commoner' elites who wanted radical change and were generally unwilling to compromise with the monarchy and the aristocracy, in particular with Rama VII, who was supposedly in favour of a constitutional monarchy.
Alternative perspectives.
More recent scholarship does not disagree with the macro-causes raised by the conventional interpretations, but it tends to delve more into the power struggles between various factions in the labyrinthine world of Siamese politics. They argue that conventional perspectives overemphasise the role of abstract political and social forces, and essentially assume the 'Western' experience of revolution as the 'model' by which all socio-political upheavals are judged and thus ignores the specific historical circumstances in Thailand in 1932. They fail to consider that the 1932 revolution took place in an era when most of the population were kept out of politics and that the political sphere was the domain of military and bureaucratic elites. For example, Benjamin Batson's influential 1984 study of the end of the absolute monarchy in Siam and Judith Stowe's 1991 study both emphasize the actions of prominent individuals such as Pridi Banomyong and Pibul Songkram and their political intrigues. A more recent and controversial study by Paul Handley suggests that the root cause of the 1932 Revolution was the steadfast refusal of the Chakri monarchs (both Rama VI and VII) and aristocracy to share power with the new 'commoner' elites. He argues that insistence of both Chakri monarchs that protecting the powers of the absolute monarchy was equivalent to protecting the sacred royal prerogatives of the Chakri dharmaraja kingship forced the 'commoner' elites and some high-ranking nobility to support or acquiesce in the Promoters’ bid to seize power through military force in 1932.
People's Party.
The "Promoters".
In February 1927, in a hotel on the Rue du Sommerard in Paris, France, a small group of seven military and civilian students assembled to debate the founding of a party to try to bring change to Siam. Intent on not wanting to repeat the failure of the 1912 plot, they laid out a clear and coherent plan to change Siam. This group included two young students: one a soldier and an artilleryman Plaek Khittasangkha, the other a law student and radical Pridi Panomyong. The group called themselves the "Promoters" (ผู้ก่อการ), hoping to return home to try to promote change. The Promoters realized, ironically, as the King's advisors had done, that the Siamese people were not yet ready for democracy, and most were illiterate peasants with little concern for affairs in Bangkok. In Bangkok itself, the new and emerging middle class was dependent on the patronage of the aristocracy for jobs and positions. As a result, they realized that a "mass revolution" was not possible and only a military-led coup d'état was possible. For this purpose a political party was formed and it was named the Khana Ratsadon (คณะราษฎร) (or the People's Party).
When the Promoters eventually returned to Siam by the end of the 1920s, they quietly expanded their lists of contacts and party membership; Pridi became an academic teaching at Chulalongkorn University, where he gathered support of about fifty like-minded men (mostly civilians and civil servants) who also wanted to see the end of absolute monarchy. It was the job of the others, such as Plaek, who had by then received his title Luang Phibulsonggram, to try to gather supporters within the Army. A young naval Captain Luang Sinthusongkhramchai was doing the same for the Navy. The number of the Party increased, and by the end of 1931 it reached 102 members, separated into two branches: the civilians and the military.
Four Tiger soldiers.
Prayoon Phamornmontri, one of the seven Promoters, himself an Army officer, and former Royal Page of King Vajiravudh, took it upon himself to try to recruit for the Party influential and powerful members who also wanted to see the end of absolute monarchy and power of the Princes. One officer he had a connection with was the Deputy Inspector of Artillery, Colonel Phraya Phahol Pholpayuhasena. An affable man and popular within the army, he immediately joined the Party and gave it his support. The second senior officer was Colonel Phraya Songsuradet. Considered one of the best minds of his generation, he was the Director of Education at the Military Academy. Both had studied abroad and were eager for change. Songsuradet instantly became the Party's tactician, advising it should first secure Bangkok militarily and eventually the country would follow. He also advised the Promoters to be more secretive to avoid official and police detection. Eventually, he approached his friend Colonel Phraya Ritthiakhaney, commander of the Bangkok Artillery, who shared his concerns about the Princes' domination over the Army and eventually he. too, joined the Party. Finally, they were joined by Phra Phrasasphithayayut, another discontented officer. Forming what was known within the Party as the "Four Musketeers" (4 ทหารเสือ, Four Tiger Soldiers), the most senior members of the party they eventually became its leaders.
24 June.
Despite all of their precautions and preparation, word of the plan's existence eventually leaked to the police. On the evening of 23 June 1932, the Director General of the Police made a call to Prince Paribatra, asking for his authorization to arrest and imprison all involved in the plot. The Prince, recognizing many names on the list that included many influential and powerful individuals, decided to delay the order for the next day, a delay that would be crucial for the plotters.
On that same evening, one of Luang Sinthu's supporters in the navy commandeered a gunboat from its dock up the Chao Phraya river, and by morning was aiming its guns directly at Prince Paribatra's palace in Bangkok. Luang Sinthu himself mobilized 500 armed sailors ready to take the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, which was situated at the center of the capital and part of Dusit Palace. Following them was Prayoon, who later that night took command of a cadre of young officers to seize the post and telegram offices around the capital – one of the officers was Khuang Abhaiwongse. All communications between the princes and senior members of the administration were thus disabled. All their houses were also under surveillance and guard by both civilian and military party members.
At about 4:00 a.m. in the morning of 24 June, Phraya Phahol and Songsuradet were already carrying out their part of the plan. Phraya Phahol and some supporters gathered near the Throne Hall waiting for the signal, while Phraya Songsuradet went with a couple of the conspirators to the barracks of the First Cavalry Regiment of the Royal Guards, where most of the armoured vehicles in Bangkok were kept. On arrival, Phraya Songsuradet reprimanded the officer in charge of the barracks for sleeping while there was a Chinese uprising taking place elsewhere in the city – all the while opening the gates of the barracks and mobilizing all the troops. The ruse worked, and through all the confusion and panic, Phraya Prasan was able to arrest the commander of the regiment and put him into custody. Luang Phibul was ordered to guard him. The armoured vehicles, including some tanks, were commandeered and all were ordered to head toward the Throne Hall. Phraya Ritthi, after hearing of the success of Phraya Songsuradet, went to the barracks of the First Regiment of Infantry. After successfully mobilizing the Infantry, he too headed towards the Throne Hall. Having been told weeks before that a military exercise was happening, other troops in the vicinity of Bangkok joined the plotters, thus unknowingly participating in a revolution. Other units loyal to the monarch decided to take a passive role by shutting themselves in their barracks.
By the time the infantry and cavalry arrived in the Royal Plaza in front of the Throne Hall at about 6:00 a.m., there was already a throng watching the assembled military. Confusion gripped the Plaza, many not completely sure if the Chinese uprising was real, or if the military were only at the square to exercise. Phraya Phahol climbed onto one of the tanks and read the "Khana Ratsadon Manifesto", a declaration proclaiming the end of the absolute monarchy and the establishment of a new constitutional state in Siam. The Promoters cheered, followed by the military, probably more out of deference than full comprehension of what has actually happened.
In truth, Phraya Phahol was bluffing – the success of the revolution still depended on facts elsewhere in Bangkok. Phraya Prasan was sent to the house of Prince Paribatra, and to other high-ranking members of the government and Princes. Prince Paribatra was apparently in his pajamas when he was arrested. None, except the Commander of the First Army Corps, offered any resistance. He put up a fight and was slightly wounded, but was eventually taken into custody, becoming the revolution's only casualty. All in all, about 40 officials were arrested and detained in the Throne Hall. One exception was the Minister of Commerce and Communications, Prince Purachatra Jayakara, Prince of Kamphaeng Phet, who escaped in a detached railway engine to warn the King in Hua Hin. By 8:00 a.m. the operation was over and the Promoters had won the day.
Hour after.
Most of the military and civil administrations offered little resistance – too used to taking orders and with all line of communications shut, they were unable to act. The next stage of the revolution was left to the civilian side of the Party. Pridi, its leader, with the help of his supporters, blanketed the capital in the Khana Ratsadon's propaganda leaflets, pamphlets and radio broadcasts, all supporting the revolution. The text of manifesto of the Khana Ratsadon (written by Pridi) criticized the monarch in harsh terms:
The tone of the Manifesto differed greatly to that of the telegram sent to the King signed by the three full Colonels and Musketeers: Phraya Pahol, Phraya Songsuradet and Phraya Ritthi. The telegram stated using royal language (Rachasap: ราชาศัพท์) that if the King did not wish to remain as a Monarch under a constitution the party was willing to replace him with another Royal Prince. Despite the language, the telegram assured that Monarch in strong terms that if any member of the Khana Ratsadon was hurt, the Princes in custody would suffer.
Royal reaction.
Even before the arrival of the Musketeers' telegram the King was aware of something going on in Bangkok. He was playing a game of golf at the summer villa's course with the Queen, two princely ministers and some courtiers, when an urgent message arrived (reportedly at the eighth hole). Later, Prince Purachatra arrived to report to the King what had been going on in the capital.
The King and the princes discussed many options, which included fleeing the country, staging a counter-coup or full surrender. However, by the time the actual telegram arrived from the Khana Ratsadon, the King had already decided. He quickly replied he was willing to remain on the Throne as a constitutional monarch and that he had always favoured granting the people a constitution. The King, later, wrote of his decision of refusing to fight: "I could not sit on a throne besmirched by blood." One point in which the King did not concede was when the Party sent a gunboat to fetch him to Bangkok. He refused and, instead, traveled back to the capital by Royal Train, stating that he was not a captive of the Khana Ratsadon.
Meanwhile, the Promoters forced the Princes to sign a document proclaiming their commitment to peace and to avoidance of any bloodshed. In Bangkok, the coup elicited almost no response from the populace, and the day-to-day life of the people returned to normal even before the end of the day. The rest of the country was also similarly disaffected, prompting the Times in London to report that the revolution merely was "a simple re-adjustment".
New administration.
By the evening of the 24th the Promoters were confident enough to call a senior ministerial meeting. In the meeting Pridi tried to persuade senior civil servants to support the Khana Ratsadon, asking them for support and telling them to remain united, unless the semblance of confusion would lead to foreign intervention. Pridi asked the Foreign Ministry to dispatch to all foreign missions a document stating that the party was committed to protecting foreign lives and business and to fulfilling Siam's treaty obligations.
King Prajadhipok returned to Bangkok on 26 June. His first immediate action was to give a royal audience to the Promoters. As the members entered the room the King rose and greeted them by saying: "I rise in honour of the Khana Ratsadon". It was an extremely significant gesture, as in Siamese culture the King always remains seated when their subjects offer homage, not the reverse. This led to Pridi apologizing to the Monarch for defaming him in the Manifesto; subsequently, all known copies were pulled from circulation. The King responded to this act by affixing his Royal seal on a document exonerating all members of the Khana Ratsadon for the coup.
The Khana Ratsadon then released all their hostages with the exception of Prince Paribatra, whom they considered too powerful and asked to leave the country instead. He later left for Java, never to return; other Princes went into voluntary exile in other South East Asian countries, and some others in Europe.
In the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, Prajadhipok and the Khana Ratsadon immediately set about granting the Siamese people their First Constitution. The Temporary Charter was signed on 27 June 1932 at 5:00 p.m., it was a draft document written by Pridi in advance. The constitution began by announcing that: "the highest power in the land belongs to all people." The Constitution basically stripped the King of all of his ancient powers such as his power of veto, power of pardon and the right to even confirm his own successor and heir. The constitution removed the Monarchy of all of its power, without actually abolishing the office itself. The constitution created a People's Committee (, the executive) and an Assembly of People's Representatives () made up of 70 appointed Members.
'Democracy' for Siam was, however to be given to the people in installments, three to be precise. First, the Assembly members were to be appointed by no other than the Four Musketeers (the military). They would exercise the power on behalf of the people, and their first session was to last six months. Second, a period when the mostly ignorant populace would learn about democracy and elections; the Assembly would then be changed to be composed of half appointed members (again by the Musketeers) and the other half through indirect representation. These candidates must, of course, have been examined by the Khana Ratsadon before any election. Thirdly, and finally, the charter stated that full democratic representation in the Assembly could only be achieved at the end of ten years or when more than half of the populace has gone through primary education, whichever was achieved first.
The first session of the People's Assembly convened in the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall on 28 June 1932. The charter however did not last long by the end of the year a new more moderate Permanent Constitution would be signed, on 10 December. This constitution eventually gave back to monarch many powers it had lost in the previous charter, the monarchy was once again held "sacred and inviolable". The Assembly of People's Representatives was expanded to include 156 members, 76 were elected and 76 were appointed. The democratic restrictions were removed and the government scheduled Siam's first election in October 1933.
Legacy.
The revolution was a product of many events, including for the most part what the Khana Ratsadon considered misrule under Prajadhipok and the princes. Others included the dire economic situation the country faced in the 1930s and the rapid social development at the time.
Despite his lofty ideals and Western education, Pridi's version of democracy faced the same dilemma that Pradhipok's version did: the notion simply that the country, especially the rural populace were not yet ready for it. Within days, the Khana Ratsadon had turned Siam into a one-party state with communistic sounding institutions such as the "People's Assembly" and the position of "President of the People's Committee". However, the Khana Ratsadon showed their bipartisanship when they recommended the appointment of lawyer and Privy Councillor Phraya Manopakorn Nititada as the first President of the People's Committee and in effect the first Prime Minister of Siam, more probably out of pragmatism and shrewdness rather than any honourable intention. However, infighting within the government and the actions of the conservative Prime Minister would eventually lead to another coup d'état only one year later, in June 1933, resulting in the appointment of Phraya Phahol as Siam's second Prime Minister.
The revolution was a huge blow to Prajadhipok and the monarchy, for it has stripped him of all of his ancient powers and privileges. Despite the cordial words, the King lived in constant fear and felt the next time a confrontation between him and the party occurred, he and his Queen both might be killed. In late 1932, the King wrote to his nephew Prince Chula Chakrabongse about his decision to return to Bangkok: "...we were all quite aware that we were probably going to our death." The many unsettled constitutional roles of the Crown and the dissatisfaction of Phraya Phahol's seizure of power culminated in October 1933 in a counter-coup, the Boworadet Rebellion staged by royalist factions. The royalists were led by Prince Boworadet and the many others who had permanently lost their influence and positions because of the seizure of power by the Khana Ratsadon. The rebellion was a failure, and although there is no evidence whatsoever that Prajadhipok was involved, his neutrality and indecisiveness during the brief conflict led to the loss of his credibility and prestige. Three years after the Revolution, King Prajadhipok abdicated the throne and left Siam never to return. He died in England in 1941, during World War II. He was replaced as King by his 9-year-old nephew Prince Ananda Mahidol (King Rama VIII), who at that time was attending school in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Not only did Prajadhipok fail where the Khana Ratsadon succeeded, they accomplished it because of the military. Without the support of the Army faction, the coup would never have happened and the system of absolute monarchy might have lasted years longer. Despite the great socio-economic changes in Bangkok, rural Thais were still uneducated and almost completely uninterested in what went on in the nation's capital. The revolution gave the military a sense of power which it would exercise 16 more times through the end of the 20th century, toppling civilian governments whenever they saw fit. Even today the Thai military is viewed with some suspicion. Nevertheless, the so-called revolution was an extremely significant event in the modern History of Thailand.

National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey

The National Guard Museum of New Jersey is headquartered in Sea Girt, with an Artillery Annex in located in Lawrenceville, New Jersey and operates under the auspices of the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.
The not-for-profit museum's purpose is to preserve and explain New Jersey's military heritage, by collecting, preserving and displaying artifacts with specific relevance and historical significance to the New Jersey Army National Guard, the New Jersey Air National Guard and the New Jersey Naval Militia. It is a member of the Army Museum System.
Museum headquarters.
The museum is headquartered at the National Guard Training Center in Sea Girt, and focuses on the role of the New Jersey Militia and National Guard from colonial times through the present day, with original and reproduction artifacts. The museum focuses on the role and experiences of the "citizen soldier". Established in 1980, the materials in the museum's collection have been documented and cataloged with the goal of becoming a certified Army museum. As of 1999, the museum had more than 4,000 artifacts, including an example of McClellan saddle designed by General George B. McClellan (later Governor of New Jersey), a collection of World War II photographs and static displays of vehicles and aircraft.
The Intelligent Whale, an experimental hand-cranked submarine based on an 1863 design is on display. Lawsuits and cost overruns meant the submarine wasn't available for combat in the Civil War. Originally planned to cost $15,000, the total cost ran up to quadruple the original estimate by the time it was completed in the late 1860s in Newark by the American Submarine Company. The submarine could carry four crew members who operated a hand-cranked propeller and could travel underwater at four knots. Compressed air allowed it to operate underwater for a total of up to ten hours and was also used to empty the ballast tanks to allow the submarine to surface. Test dives in the Passaic River in the late 1860s were successful, but the Navy decided to abandon the purchase after its operator was murdered. The submarine was transported to the museum in Sea Girt by truck in April 1999 from the Washington Naval Yard, where it had been located since 1968.
The museum is the home of the Center for U.S. War Veterans’ Oral History Project, which records interviews of veterans about their military experiences. These interviews are available on videotape and DVD for review by researchers and scholars. , the center has recorded over 300 interviews with veterans serving in World War II and other conflicts through Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Artillery Annex.
The Artillery Annex is located at the Artillery Armory in Lawrenceville and includes displays of weapons, uniforms and other equipment from various times. Two rooms display artifacts and memorabilia from the American Civil War. A Model Room includes more than 100 scale models of military equipment.

Plancia Magna

Plancia Magna () was a prominent woman from Anatolia who lived between the 1st century and 2nd century in the Roman Empire.
Ancestry, family, and early life.
Plancia Magna came from a distinguished family. She was the daughter of Roman Senator, Proconsul Marcus Plancius Varus and the Herodian Princess Julia. Her mother became a priestess and served in the temple of the Ancient Greek Goddess Artemis in Perga. Artemis was the most important Goddess in Perga. Magna’s brother was Roman Senator, Consul Gaius Plancius Varus. Magna was born and raised in Perga, the capital of the Roman province of Pamphylia. Her cognomen "Magna", is either from her maternal or paternal grandmother.
Her maternal grandparents were King Tigranes VI of Armenia and his wife Opgalli, while her maternal uncle was prince Gaius Julius Alexander. Magna’s maternal ancestors were King Archelaus of Cappadocia, King of Judea Herod the Great and his wife Mariamne. Magna along with her brother and maternal cousins were among the last known descendants of the Herodian Dynasty. She appeared to be an apostate to Judaism. It is unlikely that she attempted to exert influence on Judean Politics.
Magna married a man of Roman Senatorial rank called Gaius Julius Cornutus Tertullus, who was the son of a Proconsul and Suffect Consul. Her husband was a local citizen of Perga and his family originated from Pamphylia. Magna bore Tertullus a son and only child, Gaius Julius Plancius Varus Cornutus.
Activity in Perga.
Plancia Magna is an example of one of the most successful, influential, and highly respectful women from Anatolia. From surviving inscriptions dedicated to her and her family, it is understood that Magna, her father and brother were wealthy and influential citizens in Perga. Due to the goodness and generosity of Magna, her father and her brother, they were accepted as the second founders of Perga. They each were given the honorific title of "‘’Ktistes’’" or "’’Founder’‘".
She was a matron, civic minded and a charitable woman. Magna dedicated her life and wealth to beautification and development of Perga, which contributed to the prosperity of the city. She was a great benefactress and patron of Perga. Magna inherited and took charged of her late father’s large family estates in Galatia and became the head of her family.
In the reign of Roman Emperor Hadrian 117–138, she undertook large remodelling projects in Perga. She elevated to the rank of tutelary divinity of the city. In 120, Magna erected a number of statues depicting various members of the imperial family at Perga. Between 120–122, she undertook to magnificently beautify the Hellenistic Gate at Perga, the city’s most magnificent structure that was the entrance to the city.
The sides of the towers of the Hellenistic Gate and the horse-shoed courtyard was restored. The courtyard had marble facing with decorative architectural elements and statuary, providing two-tiered triumphal arch that had three entrances and decorated statues.
The decorated statues were of various Greek and Roman Gods and Goddesses. These deities included the Roman Emperors and the wives from the reigns of Nerva to Hadrian. The gate had a number of Greek and Latin inscriptions. Among these inscriptions, were two surviving inscriptions resting north of the Hellenistic Gate. This inscriptions resting north were probably supported by a statue donated by Magna.
Translated from Latin two lines
Translated from Greek 2 lines
Magna held the title of high-priestess of the temple of the ancient Greek Goddess Artemis in Perga. Artemis was the most important goddess in the city. She also was the high-priestess of the imperial cult and the high-priestess for life of the mother of the gods.
Magna was honored by the Boule, Demos and Gerousia of Perga with the honorific title of "’’Demiourgos’‘". The person who held this yearly title, their name was used to identify the year. Demiourgos was the highest civil servant position in the government of Perga. This title was usually reserved for men and through this title she had sponsored the local games held in Perga.
A surviving inscription on a base from a statue erected by the community of Perga, reveals her position in the city:
When Magna died she was buried in a tomb which of located right of the Hellenistic Gate.

Place names of Palestine

Place names in Palestine have been the subject of much scholarship and contention, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Arab conflict. The significance of place names in Palestine lies in their potential to legitimize the historical claims asserted by the involved parties, all of whom claim priority in chronology, and who use archaeology, map-making, and place names as their proofs. 
The importance of toponymy, or geographical naming, was first recognized by the British organization, the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF), who mounted geographical map-making expeditions in Palestine in the late 19th century. Shortly thereafter, the British Mandatory authorities set out to gather toponymic information from the local Arab population, who had been proven to have preserved knowledge of the ancient place names which could help identify archaeological sites. 
Palestinian place names are generally Arabised forms of ancient Semitic names or newer Arabic language formations, though since the establishment of Israel, many place names have since been Hebraicised or are known officially by their Biblical names. The cultural interchange fostered by the various successive empires to have ruled Palestine is apparent in its place names. Any particular place can be known by the different names used in the past, with each of these corresponding to a historical period. For example, what is today known as Tzippori, was known under 
Hellenistic rule as "Sepphoris", under Roman rule as "Diocaesarea", and under Arab and Islamic rule as "Saffuriya".
History.
The preservation of place names in Palestine "with amazing consistency" is noted by Yohanan Aharoni in "The Land of the Bible" (1979). He attributes this continuity to the common Semitic background of Palestine's local inhabitants throughout the ages, and the fact that place names tended to reflect extant agricultural features at the site in question. According to Uzi Leibner, this preservation of names is "a function of continuity of settlement at the site itself, or at least in the immediate region," and most of the sites in question were inhabited during the Byzantine and Middle Islamic periods.
The indigenous population of Palestine used Semitic languages, such as Hebrew, Samaritan, Palestinian Syriac, Jewish Aramaic and Arabic, for thousands of years. Almost all place names in Palestine have Semitic roots, with only a few place names being of Latin origin, and hardly any of Greek or Turkish origins. The Semitic roots of the oldest names for places in Palestine continued to be used by the indigenous population, though during the period of classical antiquity in Palestine, many names underwent modifications due to the influence of local ruling elites well versed in Greek and Latin. With the Arab expansion into Palestine, many of the preclassical Semitic names were revived, though often the spelling and pronunciation differed. Of course, for places where the old name had been lost or for new settlements established during this period, new Arabic names were coined. 
In his 4th century work, the "Onomasticon", Eusebius of Caesarea provides a listing of the place names of Palestine with geographical and historical commentary, and his text was later translated into Latin and edited and corrected by Jerome. Though oft visited by European travellers in the centuries to follow, many of whom composed travel accounts describing its topography and demography, towards the end of Ottoman imperial rule, there was still much confusion over the place names in Palestine. Existing Turkish transliterations of the Arabic and Arabicized names made identification and study into the etymology of the place names even more challenging. 
Edward Robinson identified more than 100 biblical place names in Palestine, by pursuing his belief that linguistic analysis of the place names used by the Arab fellahin would reveal preserved traces of their ancient roots. The PEF's "Names and Places in the Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha, with their Modern Identifications" (1895) lists more than 1,150 place names related to the Old Testament and 162 related to the New, most of which are located in Palestine. These surveys by Robinson the PEF, and other Western biblical geographers in late 19th and early 20th centuries, also eventually contributed to the shape of the borders delineated for the British Mandate in Palestine, as proposed by the League of Nations. 
With the establishment of Israel, in parts of Palestine, many place names have since been Hebraized or are referred to by their revived Biblical names. Even sites with only Arabic names and no pre-existing ancient Hebrew names or associations have been given new Hebrew names.
Roots of place names in Palestine.
Agricultural features are common to roots of place names in Palestine. For example, some place names incorporate the Semitic root for "spring" or "cistern", such as Beersheba or Bir as'Saba, ("Be'er" and "Bir" meaning "well" in Hebrew and Arabic respectively) and En Gedi or 'Ayn Jeddi ("En" and "'Ayn" meaning "spring" in Hebrew and Arabic respectively).
Other place names preserve the names of Semitic gods and goddesses from ancient times. For example, the name of the goddess Anat survives in the name of the village of 'Anata, believed to be site of the ancient city of Anathoth.
Use of place names as personal names.
Since the exodus of 1948, Arab - Palestinians have begun a tradition of naming their daughters after destroyed Arab villages.

Transition Training Academy

The Transition Training Academy (TTA) was established as a joint effort of the United States Department of Labor (DoL), Veterans’ Employment and Training Service, Cisco, the Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) and the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP). WWP administers the program as a part of their commitment to the service men and women that have been wounded or injured on active duty.
The purpose of TTA is to help US military returning wounded warriors to develop skills they will need to return to life, to the working world, to the competitive spirit, and to the American workforce in general.
Specifically, TTA helps participants explore Information Technology (IT) as a career field and to develop or recover career skills with real world potential for future employment, self-activation, and socialization.
By the end of 2008, it is expected over two hundred active duty military personnel will have completed the TTA program. Current TTA sites are located in San Diego, CA; San Antonio, TX; Fort Gordon, GA; and the next will open soon in Tacoma, WA.
What They Do.
Today's recovering veterans have unique challenges. Due to varying circumstances at different VA facilities, the special rehab needs and abilities of each wounded service person present special challenges. “Traditional” classroom training formats for many are not feasible. The Transition Training Academy was first created to address these issues with state-of-the-art, instructor-led eLearning specifically in the IT field developed through an initial grant from Cisco Systems.

O-2172 is a drug developed by Organix Inc, which acts as a stimulant and potent dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It is an analogue of methylphenidate where the phenyl ring has had a 3,4-dichloro substitution added, and the piperidine ring has been replaced by cyclopentane. It is around 1/3 the potency of methylphenidate, demonstrating that even with the important binding group of the nitrogen lone pair removed entirely, selective DAT binding and reuptake inhibition is still possible.

Ron Cottrell

Ron Cottrell is an American basketball head coach. 
Cottrell is a current NCAA men's basketball coach at Houston Baptist University in Houston, Texas. He is in his 21st season as head coach of the basketball program.
Career bio.
He has led the Huskies back to the NCAA Division I ranks after 16 seasons building a perennial power at the NAIA Division I level. In addition to his coaching duties, Cottrell is the associate director of athletics after spending 15 years as director of athletics at HBU. He was one of the driving forces, working closely with HBU President Robert B. Sloan, in the Huskies’ transition to the NCAA.
The Huskies are now in year four of the transition back to the NCAA from the NAIA ranks. Cottrell resurrected the HBU men’s basketball program in 1991. During those NAIA years, the Huskies won nine consecutive Red River Athletic Conference championships and competed in the NAIA national tournament 10 straight years. He built the basketball program into one of national prominence, perennially ranked in the NAIA Top 25, and finishing the season as one of the NAIA’s top 10 teams six times.
In 2002-03, Cottrell led the Huskies to a 31-3 record and ended the season as the NAIA’s top-ranked team, a ranking the Huskies held onto for the final five weeks of the season. After that history-making season, Cottrell was chosen as the Basketball Times NAIA National Coach of the Year. That season also boasted the Huskies as the national scoring and rebounding leader, scoring 100.4 points per game and bettering their opponents by a margin of 13 rebounds per game. It was the second straight year the Huskies led the NAIA in rebounding and the third time in the previous eight seasons that HBU led the nation in scoring.
HBU again led the nation in rebounding two years later, out-rebounding their opponents by 10.2 boards per game in 2004-05. During that 2004-05 season, Cottrell reached another milestone in his successful career, posting his 300th career win.
The Huskies entered a new era during the 2009-10 season, as they began their first season of Great West Conference play. HBU went 9-3 in the league, finishing second during the regular season and advancing to the championship game of the conference tournament. Four players earned all-conference recognition, including first-team selections Andrew Gonzalez and Mario Flaherty. Gonzalez was the league’s leading scorer and was named Newcomer of the Year.
He begins the 2010-11 season with a 391-229 record and has averaged more than 20 wins per season in his 19-year career. Cottrell is known for his up-tempo offense and pressure defense, a philosophy he learned from his mentor, former Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson. As an assistant to Richardson at Arkansas, Cottrell helped coach the Razorbacks to two Southwest Conference championships and three trips to the NCAA tournament, culminating in the Hogs appearance at the 1990 NCAA Final Four where they lost to Duke in the semifinals. During Cottrell’s tenure on the bench at Arkansas, the Razorbacks posted a record of 88-36.
Prior to joining Richardson’s staff as an assistant coach, Cottrell spent a year as an assistant at North Dakota State College of Science before returning to Arkansas, his alma mater. Cottrell knows the Houston area, having graduated from Houston’s Westbury High School. He returned to his native Arkansas to attain a degree in industrial engineering. While attending the University of Arkansas, Cottrell served as sports director for Fayetteville, Ark., ABC affiliate KTVP-TV before entering the coaching profession.
When Cottrell was hired to lead the HBU program in the fall of 1990, Cottrell spent the second year of the Huskies’ self-imposed basketball hiatus putting the program together, recruiting and scheduling before beginning play in the 1991-92 season.
The first season, the Huskies posted a 7-23 record. It was a season of growing pains for Cottrell and his young team. He had formed his base with freshmen, and although they took their lumps, it paid off in the long run. By the time those fresh men were seniors, they had made the playoffs three straight years and fell just three points shy of making it to the NAIA national tournament. After seven-and-a-half years as the HBU coach, Cottrell broke the school’s coaching record for wins during the 1998-99 season, a record previously held by Gene Iba after an eight-year tenure. The 1997-98 Huskies had a school record 22-game winning streak and a school-best 26-6 record, only to be exceeded by the 1999-2000 team with a 28-6 record. In 2000-01, the Huskies again rewrote the record books with a 31-5 record.
HBU tied the school record for wins and set a new low for losses with the 2002-03 team’s 31-3 mark and broke the record for consecutive wins with 25. In 2003-04, the Huskies saw a 60-game home winning streak come to an end, ending the nation’s longest current home winning streak for a men’s team. That team went on to finish the year with a 27-6 record.
The Huskies had at least one basketball player receive All-America honors each season during a span of 13 seasons and Cottrell has coached athletes to All-America accolades 20 times, including the 2002-03 Basketball Times NAIA National Player of the Year, Rod Nealy. In addition, the Huskies have had recipients of All-Conference honors 38 times under Cottrell.
In conjunction with the Huskies’ on-court success, Cottrell stresses excellence in the classroom as well. He has had six players receive Academic All-America honors and 53 have garnered Academic All-Conference accolades. Cottrell was named Red River Athletic Conference Coach of the Year five times. He also has twice been awarded the Houston Area High School Boys Basketball Coaches’ College Coach of the Year and he received what he regards as one of his highest honors in the summer of 2006 when he was selected by USA Basketball to serve as a court coach for the gold-medal winning 18U USA team.
With Cottrell at the helm as Athletics Director, the Huskies won 42 conference championships and had teams compete in national tournaments 35 times. HBU won eight Red River Athletic Conference all-sports awards in the nine-year history of the RRAC. HBU produced 99 All-America honorees, 65 academic All-America athletes and 241 All-Conference performers during his tenure.
He was honored for his leadership as the 2001 recipient of the NAIA Region VI athletic director of the year award. He is a member of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches, the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics and the Division I-AAA Athletics Directors Association.
Cottrell is married to the former Jacque George, who is the director of media relations for the Great West Conference, and they have two daughters, Scottlyn Rose (15) and Sydney-Anne (13). He also serves as a deacon at Sugar Land Baptist Church.

Eduard August von Regel

Eduard August von Regel (sometimes Edward von Regel or Edward de Regel or Édouard von Regel), Russian: Эдуард Август Фон Регель; (born August 13, 1815 in Gotha, died April 15, 1892 in St. Petersburg) was a German horticulturalist and botanist. He ended his career serving as the Director of the Russian Imperial Botanical Garden of St. Petersburg. As a result of naturalists and explorers sending back biological collections, Regel was able to describe and name many previously unknown species from frontiers around the world.
History.
Regel earned degrees from the Gott Gymnasium in Germany and from the University of Bonn.
He began his career at the Royal Garden Limonaia in Gotha and then went as a volunteer to the botanical garden in Göttingen. He later worked at gardens in Bonn and Berlin. In 1842 he moved to Switzerland to become the head of the Old Botanical Garden, Zürich. During this time he also worked as a Professor of science. In 1852 he founded the magazine "Gartenflora" (Garden Flora), in which he described many new species. 
In 1855 he moved to St. Petersburg, Russia where he initially worked as a research director and later as senior botanist at the Imperial Botanical Garden. From 1875 until his death in 1892 he served as the director of the Imperial Botanical Garden. While there he oversaw the creation of some of the gardens (e.g. the Admiralty garden) and the facility laboratory. He was a founder and vice-president of the Russian Gardening Society and a number of academic journals. In 1875 he became an associate member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Volume 111 of "Curtis's Botanical Magazine" is dedicated to him.
In 1892 he was buried at the Smolenskoe Lutheran Cemetery in St. Petersburg.
Plants named by him.
During the course of his life, Regel described and named over 3000 new plant species. Many of the plants he named were from the Russian Far East and Asia as Russian Geographical Society expeditions where active in this area during his tenure at the Imperial Botanical Gardens in St. Petersburg.
Plants named for him.
In 1843, J.C.Schauer named the genus "Regelia" in honor of Regel. It is a group of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae which are endemic to the southwest Australia. In 1854 Planchon named a species of "Cestrum regeli" (Potato family) after him.
Publications.
Regel was an extremely prolific scientist and author. In addition to writing a number of major reference works in botany, he published an amazing 3,101 articles in academic journals.

Deweare

Franck Deweare (pronounced “de-vair”), also known by his stage name Deweare, and previously as Franck Marx, is a musician native to Verdun, France, who has been based out of Montreal, Quebec since 2004. Deweare's style, both lyrically and vocally, has been compared to that of Serge Gainsbourg, due to his rough yet seductive voice and dark lyrics.
Early career.
Deweare's music was greatly influenced by the resurgence of French punk cult bands such as Bérurier Noir and Ludwig von 88, as well as by rock musician, comedian and poet Alain Bashung and by American music artist Beck—another musician to whom Deweare's vocals have been compared. Deweare stated in a 2006 interview: "It's that inspired me to sing, to produce something aesthetic."
Prior to coming to Canada, Deweare moved to Brussels and recorded some material under the name Franck Marx, on the same label as Belgian rock band dEUS. His work under the Marx moniker leaned towards a more aggressive rock/grunge sound.
Move to Montreal.
Deweare has stated in more than one interview that his reason for leaving France was due to the political climate and the increasing racial tensions within the country. He stated that he chose Canada because he thought of the country as "an example of integration working."
By chance, Deweare struck-up a conversation with Québécoise musician Ariane Moffatt in 2004 during a flight delay at Charles de Gaulle International Airport on his way to Canada for the very first time. After listening to some of his demos, Moffat connected Deweare with some local, Montreal talent—including the members of electro-jazz band Plaster, who wound up backing him on his debut album, "High Class Trauma". Since coming to Canada, Deweare has collaborated with many North American artists: He performed live with Moffat and wrote the song "Tes invectives" on her 2008 album "Tous le sens", he provided vocals for Afrodizz on their song "Fashion Terrorist" from their album "Froots", and he has also worked with Cyndi Lauper and The Herbaliser.
"High Class Trauma".
"High Class Trauma" was released in 2006 on the Milagro Records label, and was the first album that the artist had released under the moniker "Deweare". The album is a mixture of grunge-like guitar and electronica and is at times atmospheric, much like a movie soundtrack; the songs are all performed in English and some contain hints of trip-hop and jazz.
On the album Deweare collaborated with many Québécois artists; Deweare received assistance from Éloi Painchaud from the band Okoumé as well as Plaster bandmembers Jean-Phi Goncalves and Alex MacMahon. The first single off the album "The New Dawn" features fellow Montreal vocalist Béatrice Bonifassi—the song is a cover of Nina Simone's rendition of Feeling Good which appeared on her 1965 album "I Put a Spell on You". The album was also mixed by Carl Bastien, who has worked with many Québécois artists such as Daniel Bélanger, Dumas and Jean-Pierre Ferland.
Other projects.
Deweare is currently working on a new album which will feature songs sung in French. The album's release has been planned for the fall of 2008 and the single "Laisse aller" can be heard on Deweare's MySpace page.
In early 2009, Deweare collaborated with Ariane Moffatt and co-wrote "L'homme de la situation" on Amandine Bourgeois's first album (released June 1).

Share Your Love

Share Your Love is the ninth solo studio album by country singer Kenny Rogers, released in 1981. Produced by Lionel Richie, it is also Rogers' his first with Liberty Records besides his "Greatest Hits" album. The album has sold nine million copies worldwide.
Overview.
Four singles were released from this "Share Your Love". "I Don't Need You" charted at #1 on the US and Canadian country charts as well as reaching the top of the US Adult Contemporary charts, and #3 on the US Hot 100. The title cut "Share Your Love With Me" reached #14 on the Hot 100 and #5 in the US Country charts, though it did reach #2 in Canada and led the Adult Contemporary charts. After taking a break to release a single from his first Christmas album, "Blaze of Glory", which features Kin Vassy on backing vocals, was also released as a single, although it was a lesser hit than the first two singles. The final single, "Through The Years", returned Rogers to the charts nicely by putting him atop the Adult Contemporary charts once again.
The album reached #1 on the country charts and #6 on the pop charts, reaching platinum and double-platinum status in the US and Canada, respectively.

Frequency Doubling Illusion

The Frequency-Doubling Illusion is an apparent doubling of spatial frequency when a sinusoidal grating is modulated rapidly in temporal counterphase. Recently, it has been proposed that the illusion arises from a spatially nonlinear ganglion cell class. The presence of this illusion therefore indicates abnormalities in the retina such as glaucoma.
A more recent study's results argue against the hypothesis that spatially nonlinear retinal ganglion cells are the physiological substrate of the frequency-doubling illusion. A cortical loss of temporal phase discrimination may be the principal cause of the illusion, whereas spatial phase information (i.e., grating position) is retained.
Sensitivity to the spatial-frequency-doubling illusion was also positively correlated with reading lag and coherent motion. The results provide good support for a magno deficit in dyslexia that has its origins at a retinal level with impairment in—at least partially—M(y)-cell activity.

Richard Price (American anthropologist)

Richard Price (born November 30, 1941, in New York City) is an American anthropologist and historian, best known for his studies of the Caribbean and his experiments with writing ethnography.
Career.
Price grew up in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and attended the Fieldston School. He received both Bachelors and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University (1963, 1970), having conducted fieldwork in Peru, and then with Sally Price in Martinique, Mexico, Spain, and for two years among the Saamaka Maroons of Suriname. A year studying with Claude Lévi-Strauss in Paris and another in Amsterdam working with Dutch scholars of Maroons preceded his five years of teaching in the Department of Anthropology at Yale University. In 1974, he moved to Johns Hopkins University to found the Department of Anthropology, where he served three terms as chair, before leaving in 1986 for two years of teaching in Paris. A decade of freelance teaching (University of Minnesota, Stanford University, Princeton University, University of Florida, Universidade Federal da Bahia), while based in Martinique, ended with an appointment as Duane A. and Virginia S. Dittman Professor of American Studies, Anthropology, and History at the College of William and Mary. He has continued fieldwork with Maroons, notably in French Guiana and Suriname, as well as with his Martiniquan neighbors, into the present. Since the 1990s, he has worked with Saramaka Maroons in defense of their human rights, twice testifying as expert witness on behalf of the Saamakas in cases that they eventually won before the Inter-American Court for Human Rights in Costa Rica.
Contributions.
Price’s early contributions, influenced by his teachers Clyde Kluckhohn, Evon Z, Vogt, and Sidney W. Mintz, included the first conceptualization of Maroon (runaway slave) communities throughout the Americas in a comparative framework. His demonstration that people previously considered largely “without history,” such as Saamaka Maroons (the descendants of runaway slaves), in fact possessed rich and deep historical consciousness has influenced historians as well as anthropologists. For this work in what he calls “ethnographic history,” Price’s books have won numerous awards: "First-Time" won the Elsie Clews Parsons Prize of the American Folklore Society and "Alabi’s World" won the Albert J. Beveridge Award of the American Historical Association, the Gordon K. Lewis Award of the Caribbean Studies Association, and the School of American Research’s prestigious J. I. Staley Prize. An essay originally written in 1973 with Sidney Mintz, "The Birth of African-American Culture", has had considerable influence on Afro-Americanist historians and anthropologists, sometimes inciting strong controversy about the extent to which enslaved Africans and their descendants “retained” aspects of their home cultures and societies and the extent to which they “created” new cultural and social forms in the Americas. Price’s "Travels with Tooy", an ethnography of the "imaginaire" of a Saamaka healer, attempts to transcend this dichotomy by demonstrating that historical processes of creolization involved people making creative uses of their varied, specific African heritages in the process of nation-building in the New World. In 2008, "Travels with Tooy" won the Victor Turner Prize in Ethnographic Writing, and in 2009, the Gordon K. and Sybil Lewis Award for Caribbean Scholarship and the Clifford Geertz Prize in the Anthropology of Religion. Price’s "Rainforest Warriors" tells the story of the Saamaka struggle to protect their territory against the encroachments of the State of Suriname. In 2012, the book won the Best Book Prize of the American Political Science Association in the field of human rights and the Senior Book Prize of the American Ethnological Society.
Several of Price’s books have been written with anthropologist and art critic Sally Price, including a critical edition of the famous eighteenth-century narrative of John Gabriel Stedman and an exploration of the Caribbean paintings of African American artist Romare Bearden. Since the 1980s, he has frequently experimented with new forms of writing culture, including experiments with typesetting and page layout and authoring books that are in part memoirs (or highly reflexive anthropology) and, in one case, an anthropological novel. Despite the label of postmodern sometimes applied to his work, he prefers to consider himself an ethnographic historian. Most of Price’s books continue to draw on his continuing ethnography with Suriname Maroons, but one innovative work, "The Convict and The Colonel", centers on his four-decades-long relationship with Martinique, where he and Sally Price live for most of each year. His books have been translated into French, Spanish, Dutch, German, and Portuguese.

<doc id="20176642" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20176642" title="Prospect League">
Prospect League

The Prospect League is a collegiate summer baseball league comprising teams of college players from North America and beyond. All players in the league must have NCAA eligibility remaining in order to participate. So as to maintain their college eligibility, players are not paid. Beginning in 2012, the league will add four games to the season, making a total of 60 games per team.
League history.
In 1963, the Central Illinois Collegiate League (CICL), the precursor league to the Prospect league, was formed as a charter member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) summer collegiate baseball program. The league existed under NCAA rules and guidance for 41 years. In 2005, the NCAA ended its official association with summer collegiate baseball; however, the CICL continued to preserve the amateur status of its member athletes by abiding by the rules and regulations of the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball (NACSB). In 2009, the CICL planned to expand to six teams by adding the Hannibal Cavemen, but in winter 2008, the league ownership voted for further expansion.
Dr. Chris Hanners, owner of the Chillicothe franchise and one of the founders of the Frontier League wanted to keep a Paints baseball team in Chillicothe. Dr. Hanners, Leo Trich, former Frontier league director of development; General Manager and majority owner of the Butler BlueSox, and Duke Ward, former owner of the Frontier League's Richmond Roosters worked with the ownership of the CICL to form the Prospect League.
The Prospect League began its inaugural season in summer 2009 with the original CICL teams forming the Western Division. Five expansion teams formed the Eastern Division. Three of the Eastern Division teams began play in markets previously served by Frontier League teams. Besides the Chillicothe Paints, the Richmond RiverRats (Richmond, Indiana), played in the previous home of the Frontier League's Richmond Roosters, which are now the Traverse City Beach Bums. The Slippery Rock Sliders (Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania) played in the previous home of the Frontier League team of the same name.
In 2010, the Prospect League expanded adding four new franchises: the Terre Haute Rex (Terre Haute, Indiana), the West Virginia Miners (Beckley, West Virginia), the DeKalb County Liners (Sycamore, Illinois), and the Nashville Outlaws (Nashville, Tennessee).
Due to a change in team ownership in 2010, the North Coast Knights became the Lorain County Ironmen.
In 2011 the Dupage Dragons franchise folded after 5 years with the CICL (2006–08) and Prospect League (2009–10). As a result the league returned to a 2-division format after having 3 divisions in 2010. Richmond was moved to the six-team Eastern Division, while Danville, Nashville, Terre Haute, and Dubois County were moved to the eight-team Western Division.
In 2012, the Nashville Outlaws folded, and the DeKalb County Liners left the league to join the Midwestern Collegiate League, leaving the Prospect League with twelve teams in two, six-team divisions. The 2012 schedule will consist of 60 games and have no "cross-over" games; all games will be played among teams from the same division only. The only time teams from opposite divisions will meet is in the Championship Series.
Division and League Champions.
Teams in "italics" qualified for that season's playoffs as a wild card entry under that particular season's playoff format.
2009 playoff format: After 56-game schedule, teams with best record in each division faced each other in a best-of-three series for the Championship.
2010 playoff format: 56-game schedule divided in two halves. Winners from each half in each division faced each other in a one-game playoff (home field to team with best overall record). Where the same team won both halves in a division, the team with the next-best overall record from that division was declared the wild card. Championship Series was a two-game affair with the divisional playoff winner with the best overall record receiving a bye into the Championship Game. The remaining two divisional playoff winners met in a one-game play-in for the right to go to the Championship Game. Championship Series held at Chillicothe, Ohio.
2011 playoff format: 56-game schedule divided in two halves. Winners from each half in each division faced each other in a one-game playoff (home field to team winning the first half). Where the same team won both halves in a division, the team with the next-best overall record from that division was declared the wild card. Divisional playoff winners met in one-game playoff with home field awarded to the team with the best overall record from the regular season.
2012 playoff format: 60-game schedule divided in two halves. Winners from each half in each division to face each other in a one-game playoff to be hosted by the first-half champions in each division. If the same team wins both halves, the team with the best overall record from that division will be declared the wild card. Winners of each divisional playoff game will meet in a best-of-three Championship Series, with home advantage given to the division that wins the annual All-Star Game (to be held in Butler, PA). Game One of the Championship Series will be played at the home field of the team from the losing division at the All-Star Game, with Game Two and Game Three (if necessary) held at the home field of the team from the winning division at the All-Star Game.

K. A. Nilakanta Sastri

Kallidaikurichi Aiyah Nilakanta Sastri (August 12, 1892 – June 15, 1975) was an Indian historian and Dravidologist who is generally regarded as the greatest and most prolific among professional historians of South India.
Career.
Nilakanta Sastri was born in a poor Brahmin family in Kallidaikurichi near Tirunelveli, on August 12, 1892. He completed his FA in M.D.T Hindu College, Tirunelveli and his college education in Madras Christian College.
Sastri obtained his MA by coming first in the Madras Presidency. He joined the Hindu College as lecturer in 1913 where he taught till 1918. He served as Professor of History, Banaras Hindu University from 1918 to 1920. After that he became the Principal of the (then) newly started Arts College of Annamalai University.
In 1929, he was employed as Professor of History at National College, Trichy. The same year, he succeeded Sakkottai Krishnaswamy Aiyangar as the Professor of History and Archaeology at the Madras University, a post he held till 1946. He was the Professor of Indology (Currently renamed as Department of History and Archaeology) at the University of Mysore from 1952 to 1955. He was appointed as the "ex-officio" Director of Archaeology for the Mysore State in 1954. He was also the President of the All-India Oriental Conference in the early 1950s. From 1957 to 1972, he served with the UNESCO's Institute of Traditional Cultures of South East Asia, as the Director of the institute. In 1957, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour. In the summer of 1959, he was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago where he delivered a series of lectures on South Indian History . Nilakanta Sastri died in 1975.
Views.
Eminent Historian Professor R.S. Sharma writes of him as: ""K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, the great historian from South India, was not a revivalist. His "History of South India" is a very dependable book."" Tamil historian A R Venkatachalapathy views him as ""arguably the most distinguished historian of twentieth-century Tamil Nadu"".
Criticism.
In 1915, a Bengali historian Jadunath Sarkar, wrote an essay "Confessions of a History Teacher" in the "Modern Review" regretting the lack of acclaimed historical works in vernacular languages and stressed that efforts should be made to write history books and teach history in vernacular languages. Nilakanta Sastri, who was then a young teacher in Thirunelveli, wrote a letter to the newspaper opposing Sarkar's suggestion by saying that "English serves me better as a medium of expression than Tamil - I mean in handling historical subjects. Perhaps the vernacular is not so well off in this part of the country as it should be". Sastri's comments evoked sharp criticism from the nationalist poet Subramanya Bharathi. According to Venkatachalapathy, Sastri's Tamil proficiency was not good and he relied on Tamil scholar S. Vaiyapuri Pillai for understanding Tamil literary works. Thus he was not able to analyze the changing meaning of words over time. Venkatachalapathy says, "the professional historiography in Tamil Nadu practiced during K. A. Nilakanta Sastri's period there was rarely any interrogation of sources (except in terms of authenticity and chronology"
Bibliography.
In all, Nilakanta Sastri authored 25 historical works mostly on the history of South India.

<doc id="20176703" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20176703" title="Kotu Ellima">
Kotu Ellima

Kotu Ellima is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Sri Lanka and India. The game is similar to draughts and Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces to capture them. However, unlike draughts and standard Alquerque, the game is played on an expanded Alquerque board consisting of four triangular boards attached to the four sides of an Alquerque board. Also, pieces can move and capture in any direction from the beginning. There is no promotion to King. Its actual closest relatives are Peralikatuma and Sixteen Soldiers which are also from the Indian subcontinent. The only real difference between these three closely related games is the number of pieces. In Sixteen Soldiers, each player has 16 pieces hence the name of the game. In Peralikatuma, each player has 23 pieces. In Kotu Ellima, each player has 24 pieces. The whole board is covered with pieces except the middle point reminiscent of Alquerque. Kotu Ellima is also related to the Indonesian game of Permainan-Tabal. 
Goal.
The player who captures all the other player's pieces wins. 
Equipment.
An expanded Alquerque board is used. Four triangle boards are attached to the center of the four sides of an Alquerqe board. Each player has 24 pieces. One player has the white pieces, and the other has the black pieces, however, any two colors or distinguishable objects will do. Pieces are played on the intersection points of the board.
Game play and rules.
1. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. Players alternate their turns, and only use one piece to either move or capture per turn.
2. Each player's pieces are initially set up on their half of the board, and the triangle board to each player's right. Also, each player places one piece on the intersection point to the right of the middle point from the view of each player. Only the middle point is left vacant in the beginning of the game.
3. A piece moves one space per turn in any direction following the pattern on the board onto an unoccupied point on the board.
4. A piece can capture an enemy piece in any direction by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerque. The player's piece must be adjacent to the enemy piece, and leap over it onto a vacant point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line following the pattern on the board. The same piece can continue to capture and even change direction to capture provided capturing requirements are satisfied. Captures are compulsory. A piece must continue to capture if it is able to do so. Captured pieces are removed from the board. 
5. If a player has more than one option to capture, then the player can choose any one (and only one) of them.

<doc id="20176755" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20176755" title="Logographic cues">
Logographic cues

Logographic cues are visual images embedded with specific, widely understood meaning; they are pictures that represent certain words or concepts. These pictures are “designed to offer readers a high-utility message in a minimum amount of space.” (Beers, 129) Some languages, for example, many East Asian languages, such as the Chinese languages (Mandarin, Cantonese, Min, and Wu), and partially Korean and Japanese, are written in logographic scripts; single glyphs represent whole morphemes.
Examples of logographic cues include traffic signs, restroom signs, and pictorial flashcards. Unsurprisingly, logographic cues tend to be processed in the right brain hemisphere, the side more actively engaged with visuospatial input. Due to advances in technology and the media where logographic cues such as brand logos abound, the ability and tendency to draw meaning from pictures has become more widespread and intuitive.
Utility to education.
Logographic cues have also become increasingly useful in the domain of education, specifically in the development of reading skills. Many sources of educational advice suggest the use of logographic cues to tap into visual learning and intelligence, which usually takes a subordinate role to verbal education in schools; such sources include literacy expert Kylene Beers and a nationwide reading program, All America Reads.
Specific activities that utilize logographic cues include: students making symbols within the margins of print text and worksheets that provide a pictorial summary of the information given and picture flash cards that foster vocabulary development. (Kajder, 43) Teaching methods employing logographic cues can help to encourage and increase word recognition, text reformulation and information organization. The method also helps to tap into the sensory stimulation that encodes information into long-term memory.
Criticisms.
The use of this method has also received some criticism. In reference to the use of logographic cues to develop word recognition the "International Journal of Disability, Development and Education" writes that “the results of controlled studies show it to be ineffective and potentially detrimental to student learning.” (Sheehy, 47) The particular study documented in this journal suggested similar but modified alternatives such as Integrated Picture Cueing or the Handle Technique. The Integrated Picture Cueing (IPC) technique makes pictures out of the desired words, themselves, rather than symbolic pictorial depictions. The Handle Technique depicts the word with an extra serif (handle) that helps students encode the word and its meaning. Despite these findings and alternatives, logographic cues are widely used and encouraged in education.

I Can Understand It

"I Can Understand It" is a soul classic written and originally recorded by rhythm and blues musician Bobby Womack and turned into a top ten R&B hit by funk group New Birth in 1973. Womack originally recorded the song for his top ten album, "Understanding", which was released in late 1972. His brothers, The Valentinos, also recorded the song. Their version was released as a single, and became a chart hit. New Birth recorded a James Brown-esque style recording of the song with lead singer Leslie Wilson, who sounds like Womack, was vocally influenced by Sam Cooke. Their fast-paced version is the better-known version of the two though Womack's original, which had a more blues leaning, has garnered praise. In 1975 Columbia records released a third version of this classic track. The least known of the three, this version by Kokomo, a British-soul group, includes delicately mixed congas with a tempo similar to New Birth's and is perhaps, musically, the funkiest of the three. Lead singer Tony O'Malley's vocal style is reminiscent of Dr John's. The background harmonies and ad-libs make this an outstanding track.

In 1970 Munitz moved to the University of Illinois, and was soon promoted to vice president for academic affairs at the University of Illinois, Chicago from 1972 to 1976.
University of Houston (1977–1982).
When Philip G. Hoffman resigned as president of the University of Houston to become the first chancellor of the newly created University of Houston System, the university was looking for someone who could fill the shoes of its popular leader from 1962 to 1977. They turned to 35-year old "wunderkind" Barry Munitz—then serving as vice-president and dean of faculties in the system office—to be the new president of the University of Houston. It was anticipated that Munitz could work with the business community to build up the University's endowment. After several years, Munitz's cultivating the business community led to an offer to join a local corporation, Maxxam, Inc., that was busy acquiring other companies in leveraged buyouts.
Maxxam, Inc. (1982–1991).
Charles Hurwitz, Maxxam's president, hired Munitz as vice-president in 1982. Munitz was active with Maxxam's related companies, including serving as chair of the executive committee of United Savings Association of Texas (USAT), and assisted Hurwitz with his take-over of Pacific Lumber Company, with its old-growth redwoods, including Headwaters Forest in northern California. USAT became the fifth largest savings and loan failure at a cost to the public of $1.6 billion. 
California State University (1991–1998).
In 1991 Munitz was selected as chancellor of the 23-campus California State University, the country's largest senior system of public higher education. He introduced management practices from the corporate world, including tying a portion of salary increases for faculty to performance reviews, evaluating campus presidents on their success in fund-raising from the private sector, and mandating a common financial and data management system for all campuses.
J. Paul Getty Trust (1998–2006).
In 1997 Munitz was named the president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, which oversees the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, California, the Getty Foundation, the Getty Research Institute, and the Getty Conservation Institute. He began work in January 1998, succeeding Harold M. Williams, the first president of the Getty Trust, who oversaw construction of the $1 billion Getty Center designed by architect Richard Meier. With an endowment of $4.2 billion, the Getty Trust is the wealthiest art institution in the world. Early in his tenure, Munitz reorganized the Getty Trust, closing two of the institution's six programs -- the Getty Information Institute and the Getty Education Institute. To deal with long-run financial issues, he sought to cultivate relationships with donors and corporate partners. His leadership became increasingly controversial as the Getty Trust was embroiled in numerous controversies relating to the provenance of various antiquities in the Getty Museum's collections and Munitz' expense account. In the midst of an investigation by the California Attorney General,
Munitz resigned in 2006 and was forced to "forgo his severance package of more than $2 million, and reimburse the Getty Trust for $250,000 after alleged improprieties including lavish expense account spending."
After leaving the Getty Trust, Munitz returned to the California State University as a Trustee Professor, based at California State University, Los Angeles.
Munitz has served on the Princeton University Board of Trustees, and chaired the American Council on Education and the California Education Roundtable. He is also a director of Sallie Mae.

Tom Hunt

Thomas Myers "Tom" Hunt (c. 1923 – November 11, 2008) was an American petroleum industry executive who was chairman of Hunt Petroleum and an advisor to his uncle H. L. Hunt, the founder of the family dynasty.
Hunt was born in Pana, Illinois. He served during World War II in the Pacific with the 380th Bomb Group of the United States Army Air Corps in the Pacific Theater. Hunt flew on the first bomber from the 380th to land in Japan, and flew on a B-24 Liberator representing the 380th during a flyover of Tokyo Bay to mark the Japanese surrender on the USS "Missouri".
Hunt attended the University of Arkansas, where he studied chemical engineering, but at his uncle Herbert's suggestion, he worked for the family oil interests in Wyoming, North Dakota and in Montana's Williston Basin. He was ultimately assigned to manage the Hunt family operations in Louisiana.
Hunt played a major role in the negotiations of the June 2008 acquisition of Hunt Petroleum by Fort Worth, Texas-based XTO Energy for $4.186 billion. Tom Hunt served as the trustee for the family trusts of Margaret Hunt Hill and Hassie Hunt which each owned half of Hunt Petroleum. Al Hill III, grandson of Margaret Hunt Hill, sued his father and other family members to block the sale, including demands that Tom Hunt be removed as trustee.
Hunt spoke at the October 2008 unveiling of plans the Tom Hunt Energy Hall to be located at the Museum of Nature & Science's new location in the Victory Park development. The name recognizes a contribution of $10 million made to the museum by Hunt Petroleum in 2005.
Part of a clan that "The New York Times" described as "a family of great egos", Tom Hunt was a plain-living bachelor, who worked out of a sparse office and answered his own phone. He lived in a modest townhouse in University Park, Texas and enjoyed gardening and making nut candy. He never amassed the huge personal fortune of many of his relatives.
Hunt died at age 85 on November 11, 2008 in Dallas at the Baylor University Medical Center. The cause of death was leukemia.

Roningai

, also known as Samurai Town: Story 1 and Story 2, are respectively 1928 and 1929 black and white Japanese silent films directed by Masahiro Makino. Serving as parts of a 3-part series, the first and second installments are representative films of Masahiro Makino, the son of Shozo Makino (considered the 'father of Japanese film'). These films lent status to ensemble casts and did not rely on famous stars. The film was known for its depiction of the unique setting of the ronin town as well as for the exquisite camera work and fast-paced sword fighting scenes.

History.
The band's first album, "Good Night Glamour, Good Morning Disaster", was recorded at Near Studios in Long Branch, New Jersey. The album was mixed and produced by long-time friends Bart Schoudel and Ron Haney of the band The Churchills.
The album was recorded in a span of one and a half months in November/December 2007. Late December 2007, the album was mastered by Chris Ghehringer at Sterling Sound in New York City.
In April 2008, the album was officially released. At first, the album was only available at their live performances, but soon was quickly picked up by the teenage rock/pop culture store Hot Topic. The CD was then only available in the New York/New Jersey region, but has spread since then to different stores throughout the country. Today, the album is available everywhere in the world through iTunes and Amazon.com.
Support for the album started immediately after its release with several east coast tours as well as a nationwide tour in April 2008. Through the Summer into the fall of 2008, the band continued touring and doing festivals. Some shows on these tours included opening slots for The Ataris, Go Radio, The Teenagers, and Eve 6. The band also took part in a very high profile series of shows in front of thousands on South Padre Island, Texas for the Blender Sessions Spring Break concert alongside other great artists such as Cartel, Forever the Sickest Kids, and All Time Low.
December 2008, the band found themselves back in the studio recording a cover of The Monroes single "What Do All The People Know?" as well as re-recording several songs off of Good Night Glamour, Good Morning Disaster. This time, they recorded and mixed with Kenny Gioia in Queens, New York.
In August of 2010, The Crash Moderns, while still on tour supporting "Good Night Glamour, Good Morning Disaster" were asked by the US military to travel to Japan to play for the troops stationed on the island of Okinawa.
