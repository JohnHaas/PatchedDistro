Adrenal gland disorder

Adrenal gland disorders (or diseases) are conditions that interfere with the normal functioning of the adrenal glands. They are characterized by adrenal insufficiencies, where there are deficiencies in the availability of steroids that are produced by the adrenal glands. Adrenal Gland disorder is rather prevalent in small animals including rabbits, ferrets & guinea pigs. They may cause hyperfunction or hypofunction, and it may be congenital or acquired. Adrenal gland disorders are challenging to diagnose, but if left untreated, they are life threatening and can be very deadly. 
There are two parts of the adrenal glands, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex produces cortisol, a hormone that regulates nearly every type of organ and tissue within the body. The adrenal cortex also produces aldosterone. It helps to maintain appropriate proportions of water and salts within the body. When the proportions are disrupted, it results in low blood pressure. Most patients with adrenal insufficiency may experience fatigue, poor appetites, dizziness, weight loss, and nausea.
The adrenal gland is a gland that produces hormones that affects your growth, development and stress, it also helps regulate kidney function. 
Pheochromocytoma.
Symptoms
Pheochromocytoma is a tumor of special cells that arises inside the “adrenal glands’ chromaffin cells”. These chromaffin cells may be found anywhere in the heart and in the area around the bladder, but they are mostly found in the adrenal glands. When adrenaline or hormones are released too much from the adrenal gland, they cause high blood pressure. Pheochromocytomas are found in a person’s body because he has inherited these from his parents. With “autosomal dominant inheritance,” men and women are equally likely to inherit the disease. However, they are more common in women than in men. This syndrome can occur in any age, but mostly in between the ages of 30 to 60. The most common symptoms of pheochromocytoma are hypertension or high blood pressure. These symptoms usually occur in a sudden attack. The other symptoms of the disease are “headaches, excess sweating, racing heart, rapid breathing, anxiety, nervousness, pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, nausea, or heat intolerance.” In between attacks, people with the syndrome can experience weight loss or increased sweating. The attacks occur frequently in a week and they may last up to 15 minutes.
Causes
The main cause for most pheochromocytoma is not yet known. Inherited pheochromocytoma is a 10 to 20 percent chance of causing the disease. It is from an inherited autosomal dominant trait. According to some research patients recently diagnosed with hypertension have pheochromocytoma. It is seen in both sexes and usually between the age of 30 and 40.
Treatments
Pheochromocytoma is a rare disease where the tumor forms in the chromaffin cells of the body. There are many ways to treat the pheochromocytoma. One of which is by surgery. The first step in doing so is to find out where the tumor is and then they surgically remove it. During this process one or two adrenal glands can be removed and this is known as adrenalectomy. The lymph nodes and tissues maybe removed if the cancer has started to spread. If one does not want to do surgery then they can do chemotherapy where drugs are used to kill the cancer cells. In this process one can take pills or they can take it intravenously which is a bag that drips solutions into the vein. The way this treatment works is the drugs flow through the body killing cancer cells that are located in the body. The last method for this treatment is radiation therapy. In this they use high energy x-rays that destroys the cancer cells and reduces the size of the tumors. Pheochromocytoma has no methods for prevention.
Cushing's syndrome.
Description
Cushing’s syndrome is the result of the excessive production of corticosteroids by the adrenal glands. An overproduction of corticotrophin, the hormone that controls the adrenal gland by the pituitary gland, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce the corticosteroids, could be of one cause. It also can be in excessive cortisol levels in the blood which may be the result of a tumor of the pituitary glands, adrenal glands or from tumors or cancer arising elsewhere in the body. Cushing’s disease refers to specifically to excessive ACTH secretion by a pituitary tumor. The cause of Cushing’s syndrome is a pituitary adenoma in over 70% of adults and approximately 60-70% of children and adolescents. Cushing’s disease is relatively rare, affecting ten to fifteen in every million people each year and most commonly affected adults between the ages of 20 to 50 years. Women however, account for over 70% of the case.
Symptoms
The symptoms and signs of Cushing’s syndrome are: change in body habitus; weight gain in the face, above the collar bone and on the back of the neck, skin changes with easy bruising, excess hair growth on the face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thigh, generalized weakness and fatigue, loss of muscles, menstrual disorders in women, decreased fertility and/or sex drive, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. These symptoms are brief descriptions of what can be found in patients with Cushing’s disease and each individual may experience symptoms differently.
Causes
People can develop Cushing's syndrome by taking glucocorticoids or their body is exposed to high levels of cortisol. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that are chemically similar to the cortisol produced by our bodies. Someone can also develop chushings syndrome if their body produces too much cortisol naturally. Cortisol is used for many important tasks in the body. It helps to maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function. It breaks down glucose for energy by balancing the effects of insulin. Its main purpose is to help the body with stress. Depression, alcoholism, malnutrition, and panic disorders all increase levels of cortisol. This increases the chances of getting Cushing's syndrome.
Treatments
Treatment of Cushing’s syndrome can vary depends on the cause of cortisol excess. People with Pituitary Adenomas can treated with several kinds of treatments. Most preferably is to use a surgical method called transphenoidal adenomectomy. The surgeon uses a microscope and other instrument to get to the gland. In order to get to the gland they would either have to make an opening below the upper lip of the patient or they would have to go through the nostril. The success rate for this type of treatment is above 80 percent and can be performed more than once if necessary. The level of ACTH within the patient should temporary drop about 2 levels below normal. The patient would also be given a synthetic cortisol such as hydrocortisone. The end results usually are less than a year for the treatment to take effect. For people who do not qualify for transphenoidal adenometomy or if the treatment didn’t work, they could use radiotherapy to treat the disease. By using radiation to treat the gland for 6 weeks, about 40 percent to 50 percent of adults and a possible 80 percent of children improved. They also use a drug called Miotane to decrease plasma or urine hormone levels. Other drugs such as aminoglutethimide, metyrapone, trilostane and ketoconazole can be use as a replacement for Miotane or to be use along with Miotane. It is up to the doctor’s discretion because each one of these drugs has its own side effects.
People who have an Adrenal tumor as a result of Cushing syndromes can use a procedure called laparoscopic adrenalectomy. It is only use for Adrenal tumors that are less than 6 cm. This treatment is strongly recommended because the patient can recover much quicker and experience less pain than other open procedures.
Ectopic ACTH syndrome can be cured by destroying all ACTH cancer tissue. Depends on the type of cancers, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or combination of these treatment can be used to cure the disease.
Pituitary adenoma.
Symptoms
The pituitary is a “small, pea-sized gland” located at the base of the brain The pituitary adenoma disease affects hormones which regulate growth and the activity of other glands in the body. However, with an abnormal growth or tumor in the master gland, the pituitary adenomas do not spread to other body parts and are not cancerous. This disease is found most likely in adults than in children and increases during adolescent years. They also tend to grow slowly, but too many hormones can cause significant problems in the body. Pituitary adenomas can cause “disturbance of vision and growth and change in hormonal balance”. Other general symptoms may be headache, infertility, fatigue, low or high blood pressure, or growth failure . Some pituitary hormones which impact the sex hormones can “make a woman produce breast milk even though she is not pregnant or nursing, or cause a man to lose his sex drive or lower his sperm count”. Because these symptoms can be indicative of so many other diseases, these tumors often go undiagnosed.
Causes
Pituitary adenoma is in the form of a tumor, pituitary tumor. Prolactinomas is the most common form of a pituitary tumor. It causes amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility in females. Gigacromegaly is caused by tumors that secrete excess growth hormones.
Treatments
The small organ called pituitary adenoma helps make hormones for the growth of the body. This is a tumor that grows in the pituitary gland. There are many ways to treat this problem one being surgery. This is the common treatment used in order to get rid of that tumor. If the pituitary gland is accidentally damaged in the surgery then the way to treat it is by taking pills which replaces the hormones created. Another method for treatment is medications, which helps to shrink tumors. The two types of medicines are bromocriptine and ocreotide. Bromocriptine helps lower the prolactin levels and minimize the size of the tumor. The ocreotide is used when tumors release growth hormone and when surgery is not going to cure. The last option for treatment is radiation therapy. In this process it uses radiation to kill the tumor cells. There are three types of radiation therapy the first which is conventional therapy. In this the radiation is intended for the pituitary. The second is stereotactic radiosurgery. The tumor has a radiation beam that is intended to be serious from stereotactic radiosurgery. The last one is the proton beam radiotherapy which is a ray of protons that is directed only on the tumor. Pituitary adenoma has no procedures or preventions for this small organ.
Hyperaldosteronism.
Description
In hyperaldosteronism, there is a primary and secondary condition. Primary hyperaldosteronism are conditions in which the adrenal gland releases too much of the hormone aldosterone. Primary hyperaldosteronism used to be considered a rare condition, but some experts believe that it may be the cause of high blood pressure in some patients. Most cases of primary hyperaldosteronism are caused by a noncancerous tumor of the adrenal gland. The disease is common between the ages of 30 and 50. In secondary hyperaldosteronism, the excess aldosterone is caused by something outside the adrenal gland that mimics the primary condition. Secondary hyperaldosteronism is generally related to high blood pressures, it also can be related to: cirrhosis of the liver, heart failure and nephritic syndrome.
Symptoms
Symptoms in hyperaldosteronism includes: fatigue, headache, low serum potassium, high blood pressure, intermittent paralysis, muscle weakness, and numbness.
Causes
Hyperaldosteronism can be caused by adrenal cancers and hyperplasia but it is usually caused by the invasion of adenoma. Increased cell production can increase the bulk of an organ, which can cause hyperaldosteronism. It can also be caused by a tumor in the adrenal gland.
Addison's disease.
Symptoms
Each adrenal gland in a body contains what is called a medulla, covered in a coating called the cortex. When the cortex breaks down, it causes a cascade of symptoms known as Addison's disease. It is primarily the cortex which is responsible for
regulating how much water regulation in the body and blood from the liver. This disease usually is asymptomatic until the cortex is degraded completely. Negative symptoms of Addison's disease include: major weight loss, sudden dizziness, low blood pressure,stomach pains and occasionally nausea and vomiting.
Causes
Addison’s disease is caused when there is a failure to produce adequate levels of cortisol. This can be caused by a disorder of the adrenal glands, autoimmune disorder. The disorder causes the body’s immune system to gradually destroy the adrenal cortex. 
Treatments
With medications, such as replacement corticosteroids, its symptoms can be controlled. However, these drugs must be taken for life. People often receive glucocorticoids (cortisone or hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone) to control their symptoms. In Addison’s disease, the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and aldersterone; therefore, the drugs replace these missing hormones. For immediate treatment, hydrocortisone, salt water, and sugar can help in the adrenal crisis. An adrenal crisis is an extreme form of adrenal insufficiency, therefore, hydrocortisone must be injected immediately if one were to experience it.
Adrenal gland scans.
For the evaluation of adrenal disorders, CT is the primary imaging method. When characterizing the enhancement pattern of lesions on portal venous phase images, intravenous contrast can be useful. For patients who cannot tolerate intravenous contrast, MRI can be an alternative to CT.
When too much adrenaline or noradrenaline is produced from the adrenal gland, a tumor is suspected and therefore, an adrenal gland scan is required. One situation where a tumor is suspected is when high blood pressure does not respond to the medication. On the first day of the scan, a radiopharmaceutical is injected into the patient. On the second, third, and fourth day, the camera scans the pelvis, lower abdomen, and lower chest.
Notable people with adrenal gland disorders.
John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States was diagnosed with Addison’s Disease while on a trip in London as a Congressman. A common symptom of Addison’s Disease was the discoloration or bronzing of the skin. Many observers have noticed that he had a deep tan and his skin had a green tinge. When he was asked about his year-round tan, he answered that it was because of “exposing a part of his anatomy that had not been burned by the sun.” This was not proof of a natural tan, for Addison’s Disease usually consists of the bronzing of the areas of the skin that is exposed. Jane Austen, an English novelist, was thought to have died from Addison’s Disease. Her descriptions of her illness seemed to have fit Addison’s Disease, but a recent study has shown it is a possibility that lymphoma, such as Hodgkin’s Disease, could have caused her death.

Armenians in Denmark

The Armenian community in Denmark numbers approximately 1,200. They make up the population of refugees from Armenia, and also some from Iran and Iraq. They mainly used the churches in Copenhagen, Aarhus and Odense. The Armenian refugees were served in the church with a priest from the Armenian community in Sweden. In 2003, an agreement was signed between the Danish and Armenian governments, allowing forced repatriation of illegal immigrants. 100 Armenians living illegally in Denmark were reported to be subject to the measure.
The community.
In 2005, The Danish Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs recognised the Armenian Apostolic Church in Denmark as a congregation with juridical rights to administer marriage ceremonies and with certain privileges as regards taxation.

Blessed Sacrament School (Vancouver)

Blessed Sacrament School or École Saint Sacrement is a French immersion elementary private school located in Vancouver, British Columbia.
History.
The school was established in 1954. École St-Sacrement is part of the Catholic Independent Schools Vancouver Archdiocese (CISVA)
Religious Education.
Located in a historically French-Canadian neighbourhood next to Vancouver's only Francophone church, Paroisse St-Sacrement, students are taught about Christian (Roman Catholic) values and various faiths emphasizing in educating the whole child: spiritually, emotionally, physically and intellectually. Every Friday, the entire school gathers in the Blessed Sacrament parish adjacent to the school to celebrate mass. Parents participate actively in various school events and/or routine duties, logging 30 hours per year.
Admissions.
All students are able to apply for admission to the school however priority is first given to families that are members of the parish, then to other Catholic families, and if there is still some space then other students are accepted. École St-Sacrement has one class per grade. The class size limit is 28 for all grades. Students are required to wear a school uniform.
Parents are required to pay an annual tuition fee. Those families considered low income can receive special subsidies from their parish so that they may attend the school. The school does not exclude students due to financial difficulties.
Extra-Curricular.
Extra-Curricular Programs includes a variety of clubs and team sports, including badminton, 
basketball, volleyball, and track and fields. Speech Arts in French (Art Oratoire) as well as 
Archbishop Carney English Speech Arts training are offered in the spring. The Grades 4 to 7 
intramural program held during lunch-breaks further helps students develop skills and team 
spirit.
School Trips.
Every year, the school sends their students from grade 5-7 on educational trips. 
In grades 5 and 6, the students go on a trip to Loon Lake, BC for 2.5 days as their outdoor education. 
It includes canoe rides and hikes in the forest. This trip is mandatory.
In grade 7, the class makes a trip to Quebec which is optional though most students opt to go. The trip takes the students to Quebec City and Montreal. The trip was formally made once every year but the cycle was broken by the grad class of 2007. Now the trip is made every two years.

List of Cha$e episodes

This is a list of episodes of the Sci Fi Channel game show "Cha$e".
Episode 1.
Gameboard: The Harbor 1.0
Contestants.
"Note: In this and subsequent tables, "Lost" means the player had not been captured when the game ended (either as time expired or a contestant reached the exit point).
Episode Summary.
Map: Terminal Island, a deserted seaside port with two ferries provided for easy shuttling. Only three contestants could ride a ferry at once, and none of the hunters could board them.
The contestants' first mission was to arrange barrels in a specific order. Midway through the first mission, the first two hunters, Grant and Vazquez, were released. The contestants completed the mission, earning each of them a deflector, and then broke off into multiple groups. Bryan, Cleavant and Demetrios went across the harbor on the ferry (which they had to stay on the entire time). Jason and Mecca stayed together, getting on the boats later with Bill, who had had to use his deflector against Icey shortly after she was released. The rest of the contestants went to explore or hide away from the starting point, where Eva found a $1,000 flag.
After Bryan, Cleavant and Demetrios disembarked from the ferry, Bryan used his deflector against Grant, but was eliminated anyway after Grant came back after him; Cleavant had promised to protect Bryan, but did not. 
Shortly thereafter, the host announced that the contestant's backpacks would make a loud alarm sound in 10 minutes. To deactivate the alarm, a contestant would have to stand back-to-back with another contestant and interlock two special panels. Doing so would also award invisibility glasses, however, once deactivated, the contestant could not deactivate anyone else's alarm. Shortly after this announcement, Laura and Arielle used their deflectors on Grant. Bill helped Jason and Mecca deactivate their backpacks on the ferry while Arielle, Cynthia, Eva and Laura then met to do the same thing on land. Shortly before the mission time expired, another hunter, Amazon, was released. Laura, then seeing a hunter, activated her invisibility glasses. Bill, Cleavant and Demetrios were all unable to deactivate their backpack in time, therefore setting off their alarms. 
The host called to give a clue: "Stay seaside if you want to see the money." A few minutes later, he called to offer $3,000 for the first player to call him and quit the game. Jason, tempted by an offer, called the host and accepted the $3,000 for leaving the game. Laura also called in, but was too late. She was then forced to cross the ferry, as Cleavant crossed on the other side. The backpack alarms turned off, right before Arielle and Cynthia were sighted by Amazon. Arielle used her invisibility glasses and Cynthia used her deflector to avoid being captured. 
The host called to announce that there are Sonic Stunners available at two different locations. On their way to obtain them, Arielle, Cynthia and Eva were cornered by Amazon and Icey. Amazon captured Arielle after the other two contestants used their invisibility glasses, therefore making her the second captured. Bill found one of the two locations, which was marked with a sign that read "Hunter Access Denied." However, he found another hunter, Scott, inside a cage in the middle of the room. It was announced that she, along with another hunter (Kim) at the other location, would be released in 5 minutes, the task to win the Sonic Stunner was to pedal half a mile on a stationary bike next to the cage, and that there was only one Stunner available at each location. Bill climbed onto a bike (and simultaneously teased Scott via asking if she was in there for jaywalking), and earned the Stunner with approximately 90 seconds to spare. Mecca arrived too late, and at the other station Cynthia won her stunner one minute before Kim was released. Laura was captured by Grant as soon as she left the ferry, without even attempting to run.
The contestants were called again, and informed that the hunters in the cages were to be released, and that the top half of the gameboard (top refers to the top side of the map) would be shut down in 5 minutes; any contestants out of bounds at the end of that time would be eliminated from the game. After this announcement, Cleavant had some difficulty orienting himself correctly with the assistance of his map and was out-of-bounds when time expired; as such, he was disqualified.
Wong was then released to spot contestants on a Spyder motorcycle and alert the other hunters (although he could not capture a runner himself). Mecca was quickly spotted, and used her deflector not knowing another hunter was coming, forcing her to use her invisibility glasses. 2 minutes before the end of the game, the finish line was then disclosed as Al Larson's marina; if the contestants failed to cross under the blue gate at the marina by the end of the game, they would win nothing. Grant, using Wong's assistance, was able to capture Mecca on her way to the marina. Bill used his sonic stunner just in time to avoid being captured by Amazon, and made it to the marina first, winning $25,000. Demetrios arrived only a few seconds later. Eva was very angry because she could not find the exit point. Had she made it, she would have won an extra $1,000 because of the money flag she had found.
Episode 2.
Gameboard: The Botanical Gardens 1.0 (In Honor of Green Week)
Episode Summary.
Map: Descanso Gardens
The contestants were taken directly to the first mission by the host. They divided into two groups of 5 and entered cages made of bamboo. The mission was for the contestants to move the cages along a predetermined path and obtain tools to cut themselves out of the cages. Going further along the path would give better cutting tools. The teams were given only 5 minutes to escape. The first team to break out of the cage would win a bag of five deflectors; the second group could grab deflectors hidden near the fountain area, but only if they escape in time.
The players in cage 1 (Mardell, Shane, Jessica, Dianne, and Lucy) retrieved all four tools before beginning to cut, while the players in cage 2 (Paul, Wahed, Tyler, Portia, and Steve) cut the cage somewhat between the second and third tools. About two minutes into the mission, the first two hunters, Grant and Wong, were released. The players in cage 2 broke free first, winning the guaranteed deflectors. The players in cage 1 got free with 7 seconds to spare, however, they had to search for their deflectors.
Shortly after breaking out of the cages, Wahed sighted an inactive hunter (Icey), as well as a money flag ($1,000). A few seconds later, another hunter, Vazquez, was introduced into the game.
Mardell dropped her deflector as she was chased by Vazquez, but retrieved it and used it on him just in time. Shane used his own on Wong after taunting him. Icey was then released onto the board. Portia used her deflector on Grant after failing to remain hidden behind a low wall. Paul ran away from Icey and met up with Shane, who had just gotten away from Grant. They both split up after seeing Icey and then Paul used his deflector on Grant.
The host then called with the second mission, a tripwire maze at each of three locations; a Sonic Stunner was available at the center of each one. The mission would only be active for 5 minutes. Some of the wires, if pulled, would activate alarms. Wahed and Portia ran from the mission after Portia activated an alarm. Despite tripping several alarms, Tyler got a Stunner, as did Dianne. Shortly after the end of the mission, Shane was captured by Vazquez. Upon learning of Shane's elimination, Dianne and Lucy both expressed amusement, as Shane had made belittling remarks about them earlier. 
Tyler and Steve both used their deflectors as Wong and Icey approached them. Tyler then used his Sonic Stunner on Grant. Wahed gave his map to Dianne and Lucy, who had lost theirs near the beginning of the game. The host called with the exit point clue "Stay on track and you could win." After managing to dodge Icey, Mardell was captured by Vazquez. Shortly afterward, the host offered a $2,000 buy-out for the first person to call him. Lucy accepted the buy-out, and gave Dianne the map she had acquird from Wahed.
Wahed used his deflector on Wong, but was sighted by Vazquez shortly after. He fell into a ditch, and kept slipping in his efforts to get out. Vazquez did not even attempt to capture Wahed until after he escaped the ditch, but captured Wahed as they ran around the fountain. As such, the money flag Wahed had found was nullified. Steve was then captured by Grant while trying to read his map. Shortly afterward, Jessica used her deflector on Icey, and Dianne used her Sonic Stunner on Wong.
The host then called with the final mission: to take a photograph of any active hunter with the camera in the phone in order to earn invisibility glasses. The mission was only available for 10 minutes, and with the start of the mission, a fifth hunter, Kim, was released. Paul was the first to earn his glasses. Portia snapped a photo of Grant to earn hers, but had to use them immediately. Tyler also photographed Grant to earn his glasses, but was able to preserve them by evading him. Paul was nearly taken by Kim, but used his glasses before he was tagged, thus keeping him in the game. After a short chase, Wong captured Jessica. Directly afterwards, the host called with a second exit point clue: "In this game, the early bird catches $25K." Portia was then captured by Wong.
Shortly before the exit point was revealed, T-Bo was released on a Segway Personal Transporter as the "spotter hunter," meaning he would alert the other hunters on sighting a contestant, but would not capture a contestant. He sighted Paul, and alerted the other hunters. Paul ran, and was quickly found by Icey, but he managed to evade her.
The host called to announce that the exit point was maintenance gate #2, and that the players had to open the gate and go through to win. Tyler then used his glasses to avoid being captured by Wong, and made it to the gate first, however, he did not actually push through the gate, leaving an opening for Dianne to push through and win by a split second.
Episode 3.
Gameboard: The Studio Backlot 1.0
"Special Guest Hunter:" Former WWE Superstar Ricky Ortiz
Episode Summary.
Map: Universal Studios Backlot
The contestants were separated into 2 teams of 5. Blue team included London, Adria, Ameenah, Lucas, and Trisha. Red team included Tracy, Evan, Andrew, Lynda, and Darin. The host revealed that their first challenge would be to race over to Robertson's Saloon, where the teams would have to bounce a laser off of mirrors and light up a disco ball to earn Deflectors. The losing team would have to search for hidden Deflectors outside the Saloon. The Blue team arrived at the saloon first (Tracy dropped her map, causing Darin to go back and get it) and they managed to light up their disco ball first. The Red team managed to get their ball to light up, and everyone but Lynda found a Deflector. 5 minutes into the game, the first 2 hunters, Grant and Wong, were released. 
Lucas began searching and collecting many of the money flags ($1,000 apiece) quickly, and the 3rd hunter (Vazquez) was released shortly afterward. London and Trisha formed an alliance, while Lucas used his Deflector on Grant. Shortly afterward, Trisha used her Deflector on Wong and London used his on Vazquez, who was chasing Evan. 
The host then called the runners, informing them of their next challenge, which he titled "Hamper the Hunter". They were to head over to Jaws Lake, where the special guest hunter (ECW's Ricky Ortiz) was placed. The runners were informed to remove a 5-pound weight in their packs and place it in a vest on Ortiz. Once completed, they could grab a Sonic Stunner. On her way to Jaws Lake, Ameenah managed to escape Wong, but had to use her Deflector on Grant right afterward. In the middle of the challenge, the 4th hunter (Icey) was released. Darin hesitated with the challenge, while the rest of the runners received a Sonic Stunner and some insults from Ortiz. Shortly afterward, Ameenah used her Sonic Stunner on Grant, and Ricky Ortiz was then released. Ameenah was once again chased by Grant and ran into a corner, causing her to become the first runner captured.
The host called to reveal the first clue to the hidden exit point: "Steer clear of the Bates Motel". Lucas continued to collect many of the money flags, while Andrew and Darin met up. The host called to signal the half-point of the game, and to offer $2,000 for the first runner to call him and quit the game. Evan and Darin were tempted by the offer, and Evan received the money while Darin tried to figure out how to call the host. 
Darin and Andrew were then chased by Icey, who was deflected by Darin. Seconds later, Darin was captured by Wong and Andrew used his Deflector on Grant. Icey captured Lynda from behind, and Tracy used her Deflector on Ortiz and her Sonic Stunner on Wong back to back. Tracy then met up with Adria and the two of them ducked into an alley. Grant ran in the alley and captured Tracy and Adria used her Sonic Stunner on him afterward.
The host called to reveal the last challenge. They were to head to one of two locations (Denver St. or the War of the Worlds set) where a deactivation station was set up. They would have to swipe their runner cards into the machine, that would deactivate a homing device on their packs. They would also earn the Invisibility Glasses. He also informed the runners that Ortiz would drop the extra weight placed on him earlier, making him faster. Lucas used his Sonic Stunner on Ortiz right in front of the station at Denver St.. Trisha used her Sonic Stunner on Wong and Adria used her Deflector on him while he was frozen. Everyone but Andrew got their devices deactivated and Andrew used his Sonic Stunner on Ortiz as a result.
Trisha and Adria spotted an inactive hunter (Kim) on Denver St. and Trisha used her glasses to escape capture from Wong. Kim was released shortly afterward and Adria used her glasses to escape capture from Kim and Wong. However, 30 seconds later, she briefly removed her glasses, causing them to become useless. London used his Sonic Stunner to avoid capture from Grant. Lucas used his glasses to avoid capture from Grant, Kim, and Wong, but later, he made the same mistake as Adria by removing his glasses momentarily. Andrew's device was still going off and he was captured by Kim. London then used his glasses to avoid capture from Vazquez. Lucas was then chased by Ortiz and was captured by Kim, who had come at Lucas unseen and from another direction.
The host then called to reveal the exit point. The exit point was a red flag on the hanging shark at Jaws Lake, and the first runner to grab the flag would win all of their money collected. Adria was chased by Kim and Ortiz on her way there, and was captured by Ortiz inside a building. London managed to stay ahead of Trisha all the way to the hanging shark, but Trisha grabbed the flag off the shark first by a split second, winning the $25,000. She actually won $26,000 because she also found a money flag.
Episode 4.
Gameboard: The Warehouse District 1.0
Episode Summary.
Map: The Warehouse District, a busy area where each street is filled with people shopping. The runners and Hunters would also have to obey all traffic laws, which could have been an advantage and a disadvantage as well.
The contestant's first challenge was to run to a nearby shipping warehouse. There, they would have 5 minutes to assemble a series of gears to open the warehouse door, where they would receive a Deflector from inside. 10 gears were provided, but only 7 were needed to open the door. The host released the first Hunter (Vazquez) in the middle of the challenge. After about 4 minutes, they opened the door and received their Deflectors. All the runners split up and some of them paired up. The pairs included Anup & Brian, Dalet & Jenny, and Josh & Cassy. The host released the second Hunter (Wong) onto the gameboard afterwards. While most of the runners headed up north, Davey headed south, stating he wanted to avoid the other runners. Brian and Anup spotted Vazquez before he began to chase them. Brianna and Davey were nearby and ran away from Vazquez as well. Brian ended up having to use his Deflector. Many of the players began alerting each other of the Hunters. Hunter Kim was released shortly afterwards and headed towards Brian and Anup on the south side of the board. Up on the north side Davey spotted Vazquez and ran away, telling Cassy and Josh no one was following him. Davey's plan backfired and Vazquez gave chase to him, forcing Davey to use his Deflector. Brian and Anup stopped in an alley to look at their map. Hunter Kim came around the corner and captured Brian before he could move. Anup then used his Deflector on Kim. Brianna used her Deflector on Wong after a short chase.
The host then called to reveal the second challenge. The runners would have to use their locators given to them earlier in the game to locate a case hidden in one of three locations (Flower shop, fabric mart, or luggage shop) on the game board, inside the cases contained invisibility glasses. Anup and Jenny broke their locators running from hunters and were unable to gain their invisibility glasses and Brianna decided not to take on the mission, since she was alone and far away from any of the mission areas. Josh, Cassy, Davey, Des, Dalet, and Apryl were able to find their glasses within the time limit. While searching for their glasses, two of the older contestants Apryl and Des decided to team up. During the challenge Dalet and Jenny were chased by Hunter Wong but were able to escape through an alleyway. Hunter Scott is released onto the field. Dalet and Jenny once again run into a Hunter. This time, Hunter Vazquez. Jenny uses her deflector on Hunter Vazquez. The host gives the first clue to the exit point telling them to stay near a wall. Des and Apryl figure they are at a "wall" while Josh and Cassy discover they need to stay near Wall St. Dalet and Jenny once again run into a hunter, this time Hunter Scott, but Dalet uses her deflector saving the two of them. Anup notices Dalet and Jenny's screaming. Davey once again runs into Josh and Cassy. Davey tells Josh and Cassy the two need to split from their "alliance" but Josh and Cassy do not listen to Davey and stay together. While Jenny and Dalet try to search for Wall Street, the two become cornered by Hunter Vazquez and a Hunter Kim. Dalet chooses to put on her invisibility glasses but Jenny with no weapons left is cornered by the hunters and is caught by Hunter Kim. Josh and Cassy leave Davey to himself. Davey is then able to find another $1,000 money flag. Hunter Amazon is then released onto the board. Dalet now by herself and wearing her invisibility glasses begins her search for wall street. Little does she know Hunter Scott is right next to her. Dalet removes her glasses to see her map and is spotted and caught by Hunter Scott.
Josh and Cassy are spotted by Hunter Scott. The two run but Hunter Scott is coming up fast. Josh tells Cassy to use her deflector, in which she does, deflecting Hunter Scott. The host calls the seven remaining contestants with the offer of opting out of the game. The only contestant to consider opting out is Brianna, who is alone and defenseless. But while trying to call the host, she is caught by Hunter Scott. The host gives the remaining runners their third and final mission for a sonic stunner. He gives two locations on the map, where they must maneuver a metallic disk through a metal maze. The winners are able to gain the sonic stunner. While Apryl and Des decide not to try to make the long distance to get the sonic stunners, Davey, Anup, Josh, and Cassy decide to go for it. However on route Josh and Cassy become pinned down by Hunter Amazon. However Josh is able to use his deflector before Hunter Amazon can spot them. Anup and Davey make it to the two locations and each gain a sonic stunner. Josh and Cassy decide to lie low and not go for the sonic stunners. Hunter T-Bo is released onto the game board. Josh and Cassy spot Hunter Scott but Hunter Scott doesn't see them. After Hunter Scott leaves, Hunter Wong appears, keeping Josh and Cassy pinned down. Hunter Wong spots them and the chase begins. Cassy puts on her glasses making her invisible. Josh continues to run and is also spotted by Hunter Scott. Josh puts on his glasses just as Hunter Scott and Hunter Wong have him cornered. Josh and Cassy rejoin one another.
Meanwhile, Apryl and Des are far away from the action on the very south end of the gameboard. Hunter Icey is released as the spotter for the show in a small red truck. Anup decides to stay where he is but Hunter Kim is coming for him. Anup is able to use his Sonic Stunner and escape. The second clue is given. To find the street with the most alleyways. Josh and Cassy feel strongly that they are in the right spot. Davey runs into to Hunter T-Bo and uses his sonic stunner. Davey once again runs into a second hunter, Hunter Wong and uses his invisibility glasses. The remaining contestants are given the exit point, a car ramp. The first one to get there wins the money. Apryl and Des feel strongly that they are close while Davey and Anup make a run for the exit point as well. Josh and Cassy make a dash as well but are spotted by Hunter Icey. The Hunters nearest to their location make a dash for Josh and Cassy. Hunter Amazon spots Josh and Cassy. Cassy tells Josh to keep going and gives herself up to Hunter Amazon. Davey is spotted by Hunter Kim but gets away. Davey is able to lose Hunter Kim when Josh comes around the corner and captures him instead. The final four make a run for it but in the end it is Davey that makes it to the exit point in time, winning $26,000 (including one $1,000 money flag bonus).
Episode 5.
Gameboard: The Theme Park 1.0
Episode summary.
Map: Universal Studios Theme Park and CityWalk after closing hours.
The ten contestants were brought into the game zone and split into two teams of five, separated by gender with the attractive females (Bernadette, Brittanee, Lauren, Niki, and Whitney) on one side and the nerdy males (Haben, Kyle, Larry, Matthew, and Nick) on the other side. For their first mission, contestants had to break through a block of ice using various tools (Blow torch, Ice Pick, Hammer & Chisel) in order to gain their first weapon against their hunters, the freeze ray. All contestants were able to gain their freeze rays with the exception of Matthew. During the course of the first mission Hunter Amazon and Hunter T-Bo were released on to the course.
The ten players split up with Whitney, Bernadette, Niki, and Lauren sticking together and the others scattering throughout the course. While the others separated throughout the course and found multiple flags (more than any of the other episodes). They quickly became prey to the Hunters who had a field day with the contestants. Matthew was the first eliminated when he was caught from behind by Hunter Amazon, without even knowing he was being chased. Hunter T-Bo is released.
The alliance of the four girls (Whitney, Bernadette, Niki, and Lauren) walked through the main section of the park, but once Lauren spotted Hunter T Bo, the girls lost their nerve and ran. Whitney, Lauren, and Niki ran towards City Walk while Bernadette got separated from the group and stayed in Universal Studios. While in Universal Studios, Brittanee spots Hunter Amazon. A small chase ensued through the park and Brittanee was captured before she used her freeze ray. Hearing the Brittanee has been eliminated the three girl alliance cheered in celebration, angry at Brittanee earlier for leaving their alliance. Kyle spots Hunter Amazon in the park but is able to remain hidden when Bernadette shows up instead. Hunter T-Bo was already chasing Bernadette but she used her freeze ray on him just in time. Hunter Amazon then took over and caught Bernadette only seconds later.
Larry met up with the three girls in City Walk. Both parties wanted to use the other as bait for the hunters. Kyle is spotted back in the studios by Hunter Amazon, after a short chase Kyle gives up without using his freeze ray, making him the fourth person to be eliminated without using their weapons. After hearing of Kyle's elimination, Larry decides to team up with Lauren, Whitney, and Niki. Hunter Amazon, on a rampage during this game spots Nick and traps him in between a fence. But Nick is able to use his freeze ray and escape just in time. 
The remaining six contestants are given their second mission. The remaining runners need to hand cuff one another to a member of the opposite sex within the time limit. If they do hand cuff themselves to another member then they gain deflectors, if they don't however, lights will be turned on in their packs making them easy to spot in the night time. While all three girls try to hand cuff themselves to Larry, Niki is the first to get to him. Leaving Lauren and Whitney without a partner. Desperate to find a male contestant Lauren and Whitney try to call Haben and gets him to meet them in the City Walk. But Hunter T-Bo is waiting for them and a chase begins. Niki and Larry escape, as does Lauren. But Whitney is hunted down and caught by Hunter T-Bo without using her freeze ray, making her contestant number three to not use it. Then Lauren is hunted down with her lights flashing she is caught by a hunter. She had a freeze ray but she froze when she was supposed to use it making her the 4th contestant not to use it.
After the five minutes are up, Haben, and Nick's lights on their packs stop flashing while Niki and Larry are allowed to take off the hand cuffs and get their deflectors. Niki and Larry decide to stick together.The clue tells them they need to remain near stairs. Haben, Niki, and Larry realizing there are plenty of stairs in the City Walk stay down their while Nick remains in the theme park. Hunter Scott is then released.
While Nick is in the theme park, he is spotted by Hunter Amazon. A chase begins. At first Nick gets away from the hunter but is then cornered and caught by Hunter Amazon. Niki and Larry argue about going back into Universal Studios. Larry wishes to go into Universal Studios while Niki wishes to stay in the city. Eventually Larry convinces Niki to go into the City Walk. This, however is not a good idea because Hunter T-Bo and Hunter Amazon are waiting for them. Larry uses his freeze ray on Hunter T-Bo and Niki uses her deflector on Hunter Amazon, keeping them safe.
The three remaining runners are given their third mission, if they succeed they gain invisibility glasses. They must watch a light sequence at one of the two locations then match the sequence with the buttons given to them. But they must do it quick because Hunters Icey and Grant are waiting at each station and are going to be released. Niki and Larry go to one of the locations while Haben goes to the other. Haben is able to complete the sequence quickly and gain the glasses. He blows Hunter Icey a kiss, something she is less than thrilled about. Niki and Larry aren't as quick with the sequence and take several minutes to figure out, but eventually they are able to win the glasses and escape before Hunter Grant is released. Hunter Grant and Hunter Icey are released.
Niki and Larry are spotted by Hunter Grant, but Niki uses her freeze ray, stopping Hunter Grant. The contestants are given their second clue, it isn't a good night to walk in the city. Although the clue tells the contestants to stay out of City Walk, Haben decides to stay stating "Oh... I beg to differ." Larry and Niki return to the Hunter infested Universal Studios. Hunter Scott is first to spot Niki and Larry. Niki puts on her invisibility glasses while Larry continues to run, splitting up the pair. Larry is able to escape from Hunter Scott. Meanwhile, in City Walk, Haben is spotted by Hunter T-Bo. But Haben uses his freeze ray, stopping T-Bo in his tracks.
Hunter Scott spots Larry but Larry uses his invisibility glasses. The host calls the three contestants giving them the opportunity to opt out. Larry and Niki attempt to call the host, but Niki is the one who gains the opt out and leaves the game with 3k, leaving Larry and Haben as the two remaining players. The contestants are given the exit point, the escalator exit from the park at the north section of the map. Haben still thinks the exit is in City Walk while Larry attempts a run for the exit. However, Larry is spotted by Hunter Amazon and Hunter Scott. Larry uses his last weapon on Hunter Amazon but Hunter Scott is right on his tail. Larry would eventually lose the battle with Scott and get caught, leaving Haben as the sole survivor. Haben, realizing where the exit is, makes a dash for Universal Studios but is too late. Time was up in the game making it the first episode where everyone loses.
Episode 6.
Gameboard: Twins in the City 1.0
Episode summary.
Map: Downtown Los Angeles
As in episode 4, the runners and Hunters would also have to obey all traffic laws, which could have been an advantage and a disadvantage as well.
The ten contestants, consisting of 5 pairs of twins are split into two teams, with each twin on different sides of a wall. As they start the first challenge they must think alike to win the first challenge, earning themselves freeze rays. For the challenge, there are a couple of symbols on each side of the wall, each round, they will have to choose the same symbol as their twin though telepathy. Once they do so, they may leave, having a head-start. First, Rory, Ryan, Gary & Lauren choose the bicycle while Anne chose the clock. On the other side Kate chose the train, Brandon & Ryan & Lisa & Lauren made a match. Then, Kate & Anne matched up with a house earning the freeze rays while Rory & Troy got matched up by picking bicycles. Being the only team left, Lary & Gary finally made a match-up with bicycles and all the twins decide to stick together. As Gary and Lary match and find a strategy, Gary decides to be the boss of the two by telling Lary what to do, telling him not to run so fast. As the runners venture off, Lauren finds a money flag, as well as her partner, Lisa. Rory calls Brandon and tells him to team up in order to double up on utilities. 
Kate and Anne's strategy are that Kate looks back while Anne looks on forward.<br>Lisa and Lauren go up to a narrow lane but do not know if it is the right choice. <br>Lary has overcome Gary's bossiness by telling Gary that they need to get out of the area.<br>Gary decides this advice isn't right and stays in the area. Finally Brandon & Ryan, Troy & Rory.<br> After several minutes, Hunter T-Bo is released. Hunter Scott is closing in on Brandon, Ryan, Troy, and Rory. Spotting her, they are unsure if who they are seeing is a hunter, decides to turn around, only to bump into Hunter T-Bo. Troy uses his freeze ray on Hunter T-Bo as the group turns around, seemly forgetting Hunter Scott, as they run back to where she was, as she spots them again. They all make a run as Hunter Scott is running parallel to them but she is unable to catch them as the light turns red at the traffic junction in front of the group. Lary and Gary decide to stay in the mid-way point, deciding to guard from different sides of the street at the corners. At this happening, <br>Hunter Vasquez is released. Lisa and Lauren decide to try and make it to the perimeter of the game board, not knowing if it would be a good idea.
Anne and Kate have just spotted Hunter Vasquez, as they are trying to figure out for the first time what the hunter's actually look like, not sure if they wore tuxedos or jump-suits. 
The second mission requires the runners to find another runner and put their communication devices together to unlock a code, which in turn unlocks the invisibility glasses stashed in their partner's backpacks. As many of the twins are together, they easily finish the mission, gaining all of them invisibility glasses. While unlocking each other's glasses, Brandon & Ryan, Troy & Rory are spotted by Hunter T-Bo, leading Ryan to use his freeze ray. 
Kate & Anne spot Hunter Vasquez before he spots them and runs into Lary & Gary while running away from them. Hunter Wong is released after wards. After spotting a hunter, Kate & Anne run, bumping into Brandon/Ryan/Troy/Rory & Lary & Gary, all of them decide to stick together, only Lauren/Lisa decide not to stick with them, hoping to use them as a diversion. Kate & Anne move up forth only to spot Hunter Scott and runs back to the group.
Lisa & Lauren spotting T-Bo, runs off, meeting up with Gary/Lary, managing to run off while Kate & Anne are sandwiched in between Hunter T-Bo and Hunter Vasquez as Anne uses her freeze ray to freeze Hunter T-Bo as they both used their invisibility glasses to evade Hunter Vasquez. Despite having their glasses still active, Kate & Anne, spotting Hunter Scott splits up as Anne bumps into Troy/Rory as the first exit point clue, "Ain't life grand?". who decide to guard her as they tried to get her back to her twin. 
A buy-out offer is given as Lisa, Lauren and Anne try to call in as Anne is successful, releasing Hunter Icey directly after wards. Brandon & Ryan, Rory & Troy bump into each other only to run into Hunter Vasquez, after a mild chase, they run into Hunter Icey and decide to run back to the direction of Hunter Vasquez, leading to Rory to use his freeze ray on him as they get away. Lauren & Lisa then run into Hunter T-Bo, leading to Lisa freezing him as they run pass him. As Troy/Rory run pass the traffic light, Ryan is unable to catch up as Brandon slowed down. After trying to catch-up, Brandon/Ryan spot Hunter T-Bo and decide not to catch-up. 
The final mission is then revealed, each runner must go to a location marked X on their map. On their way there, Lary & Gary decide to run pass Hunter Wong, leading to a short chase before Gary froze Wong. As Kate made it first to the maze, she is told that to earn the deflector, and she is told she has to move a ring pass an electric maze, and for every time she touches the side of the maze, an alarm is sounded, each time with a higher volume. Despite ringing the alarm on several attempts, Kate, Lary and Gary manages to get out of the location in time as Lisa & Lauren turn up, only to find out the station they were at was out of deflectors.
Trying to get back to Grand, Brandon & Ryan bump into Icey, deciding to "juke" her instead of using their freeze rays. After almost being caught, Brandon & Ryan evade Icey, only to end up freezing Vasquez. Finally, Hunter Amazon was released. Brandon & Ryan soon bump into Troy & Rory as they decide to stick till the last 7 minutes. It is than revealed that co-ordinates A & D will be sealed off, and whoever stuck inside will be eliminated immediately. Kate panics, but eventually gets to the safe zone. Lisa & Lauren then notices Hunter Amazon directly across the street, leaving Lisa to freeze her in time. 
With the last few seconds before the board is closed, Lary & Gary bump into a red light, causing them to be disqualified. Kate runs into Hunter T-Bo, freezing him. Directly after, the exit point is revealed as everyone makes a frantic dash to the finish line, which was the starting point at Pershing Square. Lisa runs pass the tape first with her twin Lauren running past a few second later, as Kate cross the finish a few seconds later.
This is the only episode in which nobody was captured by a Hunter.

Courtney Kruger

Courtney Keith Kruger (born 18 February 1988) is a South African-born batsman who has played two One Day Internationals for Hong Kong.
Kruger made his One Day International debut in the 2008 Asia Cup, playing in Hong Kong's games against Pakistan and India, but scored just 0 and 3.
Cricket career.
International.
Courtney Kruger made his Hong Kong debut in 2004, aged sixteen, after finding moderate success in the ACC Fast Track Tournament, playing only one of Hong Kong's matches as they finished second behind the United Arab Emirates. He had to wait almost two years for his next cap, which came to him in the 2006 Trophy, where he played in all of Hong Kong's matches in their run to the final, earning Hong Kong their second Asia Cup appearance. Kruger himself had little impact with the but he was being talked about as a leadership prospect already.
His World Cricket League debut came in the 2007 Division Three tournament in the north of Australia. He scored his first, and so far only, international half-century against Italy in Darwin, anchoring his team's winning total of 195. In the next edition of Division Three, 2011, Kruger began to realise his potential with a brace of 40s against Oman and Denmark in victories that contributed to their promotion to Division Two, which carried List A status.
Statistics.
In his Hong Kong career, Kruger has represented his country in 54 internationals, as well as seven non-internationals against historic English club sides, and the Sri Lanka colts. He has a total of 466 international runs, with a highest score of 50 against Italy in 2007.
Illness.
In November 2007, Kruger was travelling home from representing Hong Kong at the ACC Twenty20 when he complained of debilitating headaches. When he returned to Hong Kong, doctors discovered an abscess in his brain. To relieve the pressure, half of Kruger's skull had to be removed for three months; he was bedridden for six. Incredibly, he recovered to make his ODI debut against Pakistan in June 2008.

<doc id="20250156" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20250156" title="Ayalon Mall">
Ayalon Mall

Ayalon Mall (, "Kanyon Ayalon") is a mall in Ramat Gan, Israel. 
History.
Opened in July 1985, Ayalon Mall was the first mall in Israel to have a large shopping complex outside the city centre with a parking lot surrounding it. Ayalon Mall is also notable for its owner, David Azrieli, inventing the word for "mall" in Hebrew for this mall, "kanyon".
In addition, Ayalon Mall is the place of the first McDonalds location in Israel, which opened there in 1993.
For the most part the mall is one story, except for a 2006 extension which contains a second floor with cinemas above some of the mall.
Since the mall is close to Tel Aviv and Bnei Brak, many visitors come from these areas. The mall is built near the Ramat Gan Stadium and Bnei Brak Railway Station. The mall contains international stores such as Zara, and Aldo, in addition to Israeli chains such as Castro, Fox, and Honigman.
"Kanyon".
The word "kanyon" is a play on the words "kana" which means "to buy" and "henyon" which means "parking space" (due to the large amount of parking spaces near the mall), while at the same time sounding like the English word canyon. With the establishment of this mall, the word "kanyon" entered the Hebrew language. The word is now used to describe any covered shopping centre and many malls in Israel since then have been named with "Kanyon" in their title.
New additions.
In July 2006, a new two-story wing was added, which included a new 15 screen movie theatre, "Yes Planet" (sponsored by the Israeli satellite company Yes), and some fast food restaurants. The new theatre replaced the old approximately 10 year old one which had only 4 screens. The old cinema was replaced with about 10 new stores.

WTOK-DT2

WTOK-DT2 is the MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station for Meridian, Mississippi. The station is a second digital subchannel of ABC affiliate WTOK-TV owned by Gray Television. Over-the-air, it broadcasts a standard definition digital signal on VHF channel 11.2 from a transmitter south of Meridian on Crestview Circle (along MS 145/Roebuck Drive) in unincorporated Lauderdale County. Known on-air as myTOK2, the station can also be seen on Comcast channel 2. Syndicated programming on WTOK-DT2 includes "Family Guy", "Two and a Half Men", "Friends" and "Family Feud" among others. Overnight, it airs paid programming from Jewelry Television.
WTOK-DT2's parent station has studios on 23rd Avenue in Meridian's Mid-Town section. The station signed-on in early 2006 as the market's first locally based Fox affiliate. Known on-air as "Fox Meridian", it could also be seen on Comcast channel 10 and in high definition on digital channel 434. WTOK had previously served as a partial Fox affiliate in the mid-1990s carrying NFL broadcasts as well as selected Fox programming in late night time-slots. Otherwise, access to the network was provided through its national service Foxnet and WDBB in Tuscaloosa, Alabama on cable.
Starting September 5, 2006, it began airing programming from Fox's new sister network MyNetworkTV. Shows from that network aired Monday through Saturday nights from 9 until 11 in a delayed arrangement. After NBC affiliate WGBC acquired the area's Fox affiliation in late 2008, WTOK-DT2 became known as "myTOK2" to reflect the stations shift to primary MyNetworkTV affiliation. At this point, overnight programming from The Sportsman Channel was dropped and Jewelry Television took its place. It also moved from Comcast channel 10 to channel 2 and surrendered the digital channel 434 allotment to WGBC.
Newscasts.
WTOK-DT2 does not currently offer any live newscasts produced by its parent station (such as in prime time at 9). There is, however, a repeat of "Good Morning Meridian" from 7:30 until 9 on weekday mornings. Every morning at Midnight, there is a rebroadcast of the previous night's edition of "NewsCenter 11 at 10".

Bushranger (4WD)

The Bushranger (also known as Bushrangie) is an Australian 4wd buggy made by John E Davis Motor Works derived from the British Dakar but is considerably different, although both use Range Rover parts. Options like roofs, front and rear butterfly doors and canvas doors and roofs were available as well. Little is known about the vehicle as it is shadowed by the Dakar. Red Bull also have a Bushranger as a promotional vehicle.
The Dakar and the Bushranger are basically a scrapped Range Rover; chassis has been removed behind the rear wheels, a roll cage added and a fibre-glass shell body placed over the top. The interior is usually that of a Range Rover, or a Land Rover Discovery, and the engine and gearbox is also Range Rover or Land Rover, however a few mild to wild engines have been used.
Bushrangers in kit-form.
In kit form, where one buys the shell, and the roll cage from either manufacturer, one must then purchase a donor vehicle – usually a full chassised Range Rover (from wrecking or scrapping motor vehicle yards). Initially the donor vehicle is pulled down to a 'bare bones' rolling chassis, and then the process of putting the kit together starts. Timewise, it can take anywhere from a few months to a couple years, all depending on how much time, effort, and money one has.

Charles G. Widdén

Charles G. Widdén was a Swedish-born singer and comedian in the first quarter of the 20th century. He was based in New York City and performed primarily on the East Coast.
Swedish-American entertainer.
As a young child Charles G. Widdén came with his family to Worcester, Massachusetts. He is said to have been from the Swedish province of Närke. During the 1910s he became a very successful "bondkomiker" (rustic comic).
"Bondkomik" (rustic humor) was a popular form of entertainment in turn-of-the-century Sweden. It also had a large following among Swedish-Americans. The rustic comic, often clad as a country bumpkin, assumed an alias to go along with his outlandish appearance. Widdén, for instance, sometimes went by the name of Olle ve kvarna (Olle at the mill). Hjalmar Peterson was another "bondkomiker" from Sweden, who was active at the same time and had a similar repertoire. Peterson was better known by his stage name of Olle i Skratthult (Olle from Laughtersville).
Eventually Widdén moved to Brooklyn's large Swedish-Norwegian colony and became quite well known within the IOGT (International Order of Good Templars). Proximity to record companies in New York turned him into one of Swedish-America's leading recording artists. There is only one photograph of the man, and little is known about his personal life.
Popular recording artist.
Between 1913 and 1924 Charles G. Widdén recorded over 100 sides for the Columbia, Edison and Victor labels. His output was steady. His new releases came out every single year in this period. Widdén’s repertoire consisted of songs, poems, stories and monologues. Other than a few monologues in English he did everything in his native Swedish.
The poetry included several works by the Swedish author Gustaf Fröding, whose lyrics and stories — popular on both sides of the Atlantic — were a staple of rustic humor. Widdén recorded Fröding’s poems concerning the supernatural: "Bergslagstroll" (Mountain trolls) and "Skögsrån" (The wood sprite) as well as those dealing with the emigration to America: "Farväll" (Farewell) and "I bönhuset" (At the prayer meeting). J. L. Runeberg's poems of patriotic Finns were also represented: "Soldatgossen" (The soldier boy) and "Sven Duva" (a hero of the 1808-1809 war against Russia). These verses were part of Runeberg’s epic work "Fänrik Ståls Sägner" (The Tales of Ensign Stål).
About one third of Widdén’s output was spoken word material, and much of his popularity rested on his original comic monologues. Today he is mainly remembered for the yodel-like laugh with which he punctuated these homespun tales. When speaking Swedish he sometimes assumed the comic persona of Olle ve kvarna (Olle at the mill). In English he became "Peterson". His 1917 story “Peterson at the Turkish bath” was one of the first Scandinavian dialect recordings.
Charles G. Widdén had a wide-ranging musical repertoire. He recorded over sixty songs — drawing on everything from folk music and vaudeville to musical revues and dance tunes. Most notably Widdén recorded "Kostervalsen" (The waltz on Koster isle) and fifteen other numbers by Göran Svenning and David Hellström. He also covered songs by Lars Bondeson, Axel Engdahl, Adolf Englund, Gustaf Fröding, Skånska Lasse, Emil Norlander, Theodor Pinet and Ernst Rolf.
Widdén’s comic songs often dealt with marital problems. Swedish songs such as "Jäntblig" (Maidens' glances) and "Stackars Olson" (Poor old Olson) were joined by American songs in translation: "Lucky Jim" as "Lycklige Jim" and "Don’t take me home" as "Mister Johnsons klagan" (Mister Johnson's lament). Regardless of the source, they were cautionary tales of henpecked husbands. "Våran bal" (Our ball) was a Swedish version of the Irving Berlin hit "Everybody’s doin’ it now". Although not inherently racist, the Berlin composition was considered a Coon song because of the affected manner in which it was sung by White artists.
Charles G. Widdén made his final recording in 1924, leaving behind an enormous catalog of music and humor. More than eighty years later his records are still sold by vintage music stores and online retailers. In 2011 the Library of Congress opened its National Jukebox web site with streaming audio for eighteen of Widdén's songs and stories.
Renewed interest in Charles G. Widdén.
In the 1970s Charles G. Widdén was rediscovered in his native country and in the United States. The Swedish Emigrant Institute of Växjö gave prominent mention to Olle i Skratthult (Hjalmar Peterson) and Charles G. Widdén in a 1973 exhibit on entertainment in Swedish America. A small disc was produced for the occasion with excerpts from their songs and stories.
The Snoose Boulevard Festival was held in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis from 1972 through 1977. In the late 19th century Cedar Avenue became known as “Snoose Boulevard”, a nickname often given to the main street in Scandinavian communities. The term derived from the residents’ fondness for "snus" (snuff), an inexpensive form of tobacco. The event, which celebrated the area’s Scandinavian past, featured the music, food, and arts of the immigrants who had once lived there. The headline performer was Anne-Charlotte Harvey, a singer originally from Stockholm, Sweden. In conjunction with the festival she recorded three albums of folk tunes, emigrant ballads, hymns, waltzes and comic songs. The non-profit Olle i Skratthult Project sponsored the annual celebration and the recordings. Harvey’s albums, produced by the renowned ethnomusicologist Maury Bernstein, included six songs from Widdén’s discography.
The Swedish singers Gustav Fonandern and Lydia Hedberg toured the United States and made recordings for Columbia and Victor Records during the 1920s. Three of their songs — ones that Widdén had also recorded — were released by the Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research on the 1981 LP "From Sweden to America". The album was issued as a CD in 1996 and in 2011 became available at iTunes and Amazon mp3. Recorded in Sweden and the United States between 1917 and 1980, the collection had numbers by Olle i Skratthult, Olga Lindgren, Ragnar Hasselgren and Anne-Charlotte Harvey as well.
"Peterson’s brother-in-law” excerpt (1917 recording).
My brother-in-law Peterson is the funniest fellow you ever saw in all your life. One night last week he went out to dinner with a friend of his by the name of Carlson, and both of them ordered steak. So the waitress served the two steaks on one big platter, and my brother-in-law Peterson was kind of hungry, I guess. Because he made a grab for one of the pieces of steak, and it happened to be the biggest steak that he got a hold of. So Carlson he didn’t like that very much, so he said to Peterson, “Say, Peterson, you is not very polite in your table manners. Now if I had taken one of those pieces of steak first I would have taken one of the smaller pieces instead of the bigger.” “Well”, said Peterson, “you got the small piece of steak. What are you kicking about?!” ("laughs")

Scott Braley

Scott Braley (born March 26, 1947) was a leftist activist and a regional organizer for the Michigan State University's chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society, better known as SDS. Braley became a member of Weatherman (later known as Weather Underground Organization) in 1969 and remained so until the group disbanded in 1977. Braley was one of the original members of the Revolutionary Youth Movement, a group devoted to anti-racism and Third World struggles which later evolved into Weatherman.
Revolutionary beginnings.
Martin Luther King Jr. was an inspiration for Scott Braley, and the reason for Braley's desire to see an escalation in the struggle for equal rights. “It seemed like a pretty clear choice,” Braley was quoted as saying, “To be on the immoral and historically losing side of white supremacy, or to join a vibrant struggle for liberation around the world.” It was because of MLK that Braley dropped out of school in 1967 and started organizing SDS chapters in his area full time.
Flint War Council.
Braley attended the December 1969 SDS National Meeting, held in Flint, Michigan and later called the Flint War Council. It was during this meeting that members of Weatherman officially decided to move underground. Attendees at the War Council discussed issues such as women’s liberation, youth culture, and the imperialism that existed in the events of the Vietnam War. SDS demonstrated these issues and opinions through satirical Christmas carols and spinoffs of popular songs, such as changing the lyrics to the Supremes’ “Stop! In the Name of Love” to “Stop This Imperialist Plunder.” Government documents note that the room in which the SDS National War Council was held was rented under Braley's name.
Hampton-Clark murders.
Government surveillance and violence against civil rights leaders served to strengthen Scott Braley's political resolve. Fred Hampton was an activist and the leader of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panthers. Considered by Weather members to be a comrade in the struggle for black rights, Hampton criticized Weatherman actions, especially those used in the Days of Rage, calling the group opportunistic and chauvinistic. Two months after the Days of Rage in 1969, Hampton was found murdered in his apartment, along with fellow Black Panther Mark Clark. When the murder was linked to the FBI, Braley was quoted as saying that the murders proved that “the stakes really were what we thought they were.”
Underground.
Braley remained underground with the group until the dissolution of WUO in 1977. Originally opposed to the suggestion of surfacing, Braley stated in an interview excerpted in Dan Berger's book "Outlaws of America" that the decision was tormenting.
Red Dragon Print Collective.
In 1973, the Weather Underground Organization established a printing operation called the Red Dragon Print Collective, a venture which Braley helped run. Operating out of a soundproof apartment, the print collective was a formative part of the Weather Underground Organization for its final three years. The Red Dragon Print Collective was responsible for producing the Weather Underground Organization's book "Prairie Fire". All printing, binding, and collating of materials was done by the members themselves. As a precaution, work was done wearing gloves to ensure that no fingerprints would be left.
Later life.
Scott Braley lives in Oakland, California where he works as a photographer for social justice and non-profit organizations.

Low and high hierarchies

In the computational complexity theory, the low hierarchy and high hierarchy of complexity levels were introduced in 1983 by Uwe Schöning to describe the internal structure of the complexity class NP.
Later these hierarchies were extended to sets outside NP.
The framework of high/low hierarchies makes sense only under the assumption that P is not NP. On the other hand, if the low hierarchy consists of at least two levels, then P is not NP.
It is not known whether these hierarchies cover all NP.

Mr. Belvedere Goes to College

Mr. Belvedere Goes to College is a 1949 American comedy film directed by Elliott Nugent. The screenplay written by Mary Loos, Mary C. McCall, Jr., and Richard Sale was based on characters created by Gwen Davenport. The film focuses on prickly genius Lynn Belvedere (Clifton Webb) who enrolls in a major university with the intention of obtaining a four year degree in only one year.
Plot Summary.
Lynn Belvedere is the successful author of a novel called "Hummingbird Hill". Because of the contents of the book, he has acquired quite a reputation and at the same time been sued and awarded a large cash prize from a foundation. Unfortunately he is required to have a college degree to pick up the prize.
Belvedere decides to enroll at Clemens University, in a four-year program. His intention is to complete the degree in one year only, even though he has no previous education. He passes the entrance exams with flying colors because he is self-taught genius, and begins his education. The Dean makes him promise not to bring bad publicity and lawsuits to the university.
At his dorm, he is assigned to share a room with a freshman named Corny Whittaker and a bossy sophomore named Avery Brubaker. Shortly after he has begun studying, a fellow student who writes for the school paper, Ellen Baker, wants to interview him. He refuses the interview.
Belvedere gets a job as a hasher at a sorority house from the job coordinator Bill Chase. Bill is romantically interested in Ellen, and later at a dinner he introduces her to his mother, who is in charge of the sorority where Belvedere works. Belvedere plumply comments on some of the other girls' behavior and etiquette at the dinner.
Belvedere doesn't fit in well, and soon he is accused for having shaved during "Whisker Week". His punishment for his disobedience is having to wear a fake beard until further notice. A photo from the mock trial in which Belvedere is sentenced appears in an article written by Ellen. The article includes quotes from Belvedere that are critical of the other students at the university. The university is very displeased with Belvedere's alleged comments, even though Belvedere denounces the article for inaccuracy and plans to sue Ellen. He also threatens to sue the university. Belvedere argues with Ellen, accusing her of publishing pure gossip. He also refuses to allow her to submit the article to a major magazine.
A major sports competition between the sororities is announced, and Belvedere decides to participate in the pole vault, since the winners are freed from wearing the demeaning freshman clothes. He wins an excruciating victory, almost beating the all-time record at the university.
The relationship between Bill and Ellen deepens, and she brings him home to meet her son, Davy. She tells Bill that she is a widow. He is troubled by this information, and it takes him several weeks to reconcile himself to her status. He returns to Ellen to explain his reaction, and they become engaged. Bill's mother, who thought he was dating a debutante, is scandalized.
When Ellen gets a cool reception from Bill's mother, she believes that Belvedere has been spreading foul rumors about her. She decides to send her article about Belvedere to the major magazine after all. Bill pleads with her not to, since both she and Belvedere will be in trouble. They argue. Belvedere arrives to talk to her, but she won't let him in. He sneaks in through the window. The police find him in her apartment and arrest him, believing he is a peeping tom.
Belvedere is released after using his one phone call to call an old friend, J. Edgar Hoover. Ellen drops the charges and offers to collaborate with him on the article.
Belvedere successfully completes his degree in one year. The school president is happy that he didn't bring bad publicity to the university. After the Dean toasts him, Belvedere holds up the magazine with the article about him, featuring the Dean on the cover.

Geopolitical ontology

A geopolitical ontology is a mechanism to describe, manage and exchange data related to geopolitical entities such as countries, territories, regions and other similar areas.
Definitions and examples.
An Ontology is a kind of dictionary that describes information in a certain domain using concepts and relationships. It is often implemented using OWL (Web Ontology Language), an XML-based standard language that can be interpreted by computers.
The advantage of describing information in an ontology is that it enables to acquire domain knowledge by defining hierarchical structures of classes, adding individuals, setting object properties and datatype properties, and assigning restrictions.
FAO ontology.
The geopolitical ontology, developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), provides names in seven languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, English, Spanish, Russian and Italian) and identifiers in various international coding systems (ISO2, ISO3, AGROVOC, FAOSTAT, FAOTERM, GAUL, UN, UNDP and DBPediaID codes) for territories and groups. Moreover, the FAO geopolitical ontology tracks historical changes from 1985 up until today; provides geolocation (geographical coordinates); implements relationships among countries and countries, or countries and groups, including properties such as "has border with", "is predecessor of", "is successor of", "is administered by", "has members", and "is in group"; and disseminates country statistics including country area, land area, agricultural area, GDP or population.
The FAO geopolitical ontology provides a structured description of data sources. This includes: source name, source identifier, source creator and source's update date. Concepts are described using the Dublin Core vocabulary (http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description).
In summary, the main objectives of the FAO geopolitical ontology are:
It is possible to download the FAO geopolitical ontology in OWL and RDF formats. Documentation is available in the FAO Country Profiles Geopolitical information web page.
Features of the FAO ontology.
The geopolitical ontology contains :
Implementation into OWL.
The FAO geopolitical ontology is implemented in OWL. It consists of classes, properties, individuals and restrictions. Table 1 shows all classes, gives a brief description and lists some individuals that belong to each class. Note that the current version of the geopolitical ontology does not provide individuals of the class "disputed" territories. Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate datatype properties and object properties.
Geopolitical ontology in Linked Open Data.
The FAO Geopolitical ontology is embracing the W3C Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative and released its RDF version of the geopolitical ontology in March 2011. 
The term 'Linked Open Data' refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the Web. The key technologies that support Linked Data are URIs, HTTP and RDF. 
The RDF version of the geopolitical ontology is compliant with all Linked data principles to be included in the Linked Open Data cloud, as explained in the following paragraphs. 
Every resource in the OWL format of the FAO Geopolitical Ontology has a unique URI. Dereferenciation was implemented to allow for three different URIs to be assigned to each resource as follows: 
In addition the current URIs used for OWL format needed to be kept to allow for backwards compatibility for other systems that are using them. Therefore, the new URIs for the FAO Geopolitical Ontology in LOD were carefully created, using “Cool URIs for Semantic Web” and considering other good practices for URIs, such as DBpedia URIs. 
The URIs of the geopolitical ontology need to be permanent, consequently all transient information, such as year, version, or format was avoided in the definition of the URIs. 
The new URIs can be accessed at
http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/ 
For example, for the resource “Italy” the URIs are the following: 
In addition, the “owl:sameAs” is used to map the new URIs to the OWL representation. 
When a non-information resource is looked up without any specific representation format, then, the server needs to redirect the request to information resource with an HTML representation. 
For example, to retrieve the resource “Italy” (http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/Italy), which is a non-information resource, the server redirects to the html page of “Italy” (http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/page/Italy).
The total number of triple statements in FAO Geopolitical Ontology is 22,495. 
At least 50 links to a dataset already in the current LOD Cloud: 
FAO Geopolitical Ontology has 195 links to DBpedia, which is already part of the LOD Cloud. 
FAO Geopolitical Ontology provides the entire dataset as a RDF dump. It is available at http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/data 
The RDF version of the FAO Geopolitical Ontology has been already registered in CKAN (http://ckan.net/package/fao-geopolitical-ontology) and it was requested to add it into the LOD Cloud.
Example of use.
The FAO Country Profiles is an information retrieval tool which groups the FAO's vast archive of information on its global activities in agriculture and rural development in one single area and catalogues it exclusively by country.
The FAO Country Profiles system provides access to country-based heterogeneous data sources. By using the geopolitical ontology in the system, the following benefits are expected:
Figure 3 shows a page in the FAO Country Profiles where the geopolitical ontology is described.

Denver Water

Denver Water serves 1.3 million people in the City and County of Denver, Colorado and a portion of its surrounding suburbs. Established in 1918, the utility is a public agency funded by water rates and new tap fees, not taxes. It is Colorado's oldest and largest water utility.
Overview.
A five member Board of Water Commissioners is appointed by the mayor of Denver to six-year terms. This board ultimately controls Denver Water. The Board of Water Commissioners in turn designates a manager who is in charge of day-to-day operations.
Denver Water's primary water sources are the South Platte River, Blue River, Williams Fork and Fraser River watersheds, but it also uses water from the South Boulder Creek, Ralston Creek and Bear Creek watersheds.
History.
The first residents of the Denver area drank water directly from the creek and river. Surface wells and buckets of water sufficed for a while as a delivery system, but they soon proved inadequate. Irrigation ditches were the next step forward.
In 1870, when the rapidly growing community had a population of almost 5,000, the Denver City Water Company was formed. In 1872, with a large well, a steam pump and four miles (6 km) of mains, Denver City Water Company began to provide water to homes. Over the next two decades, 10 water companies fought, collapsed or merged.
As technology progressed, so did the treatment process. By 1906, Denver water was being chlorinated to prevent cholera and typhoid.
In 1918, Denver residents voted to form a five-member Board of Water Commissioners and buy the Denver Union Water Company's water system for $14 million, creating Denver Water. From that time on, Denver Water planned and developed a system to meet the needs of the people of Denver and the surrounding areas.
Plan for the future.
Today, Denver Water harvests of water a year, which is about one-third of the state's treated water supply. Denver Water uses 2 percent of all water (treated and untreated) in Colorado ( per year).
Denver Water also no longer relies on only one option – building new reservoirs – to ensure customers always have the water they need. Instead, it has a diverse plan to meet those future needs: conserve, recycle and develop. 
Conserve
Denver Water invests millions of dollars into conservation programs to encourage customers to reduce their use. The utility provides rebates to customers who buy water-efficient fixtures, conducts free audits of homes and business that use high amounts of water, provides incentive contracts for large-scale consumers to reduce their water consumption, enforces watering rules and spearheads an award-winning advertising campaign to encourage customers to Use Only What You Need. Customers today are using 18 percent less water than they were before the 2002 drought – and there are 10 percent more of them.
Recycle
Recycled water from Denver Water's recycled water distribution system supplies industrial and irrigation customers with nonpotable water, thereby freeing up drinking water for other purposes and reducing trans-mountain diversions. Now, the recycled water system is freeing up enough drinking water to serve roughly 15,000 households; once it’s complete, the system will free up enough drinking water to serve almost 45,000 homes. There are more than a dozen wastewater recycling programs in Colorado, and Denver Water operates the largest recycled water system in Colorado.
Develop
Denver Water has begun plans to expand Gross Reservoir, which would allow the utility to supply customers with an additional of water each year – the amount of water used by roughly 45,000 homes. Denver Water also is turning gravel pits to water storage sites, which allows it to store and release reusable water to meet downstream water requirements.

Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell

Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell is a 1951 comedy film, the third and final one starring Clifton Webb as Lynn Belvedere. Mr. Belvedere lies about his age and lives in a senior citizens home to determine if there was any point in growing old. As a result, he inspires the residents of the senior citizen home that even at an older age, life is worth living if you use your imagination.
The film was based on the play "The Silver Whistle" by Robert E. MacEnroe. Although the plot of the film resembles that of the play, Belvedere was not a character in the play. The leading character was a hobo named Oliver Erwenter, played by José Ferrer. "The Silver Whistle", with all of its original characters, was telecast in 1959 on "Playhouse 90", in which Eddie Albert played the role of Erwenter.

A global recession is a period of global economic slowdown. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) takes many factors into account when defining a global recession. Until April 2009, IMF several times communicated to the press, that a global annual real GDP growth of 3.0 percent or less in their view was "equivalent to a global recession".
By this measure, six periods since 1970 qualify: 19741975, 19801983, 19901993, 1998, 20012002, and 20082009.
In April 2009, IMF changed their Global recession definition to: 
By this new definition, a total of four global recessions took place since World War II: 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009. All of them only lasted one year, although the third would have lasted three years (199193) if IMF as criteria had used the normal exchange rate weighted percapita real World GDP rather than the purchase power parity weighted percapita real World GDP. The latest 2009 global recession, commonly referred to as the Great Recession, was by far the worst of the four post-war recessions, both in terms of how many countries were affected and how much the "real World GDP per capita" declined.
Overview.
Informally, a national recession is a period of declining economic output. In a 1974 New York Times article, Julius Shiskin suggested several rules of thumb to identify a recession, which included two successive quarterly declines in gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the nation's output. This two-quarter metric is now a commonly held definition of a recession. In the United States, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is regarded as the authority which identifies a recession and which takes into account several measures in addition to GDP growth before making an assessment. In many developed nations other than USA, the two-quarter rule is also used for identifying a recession.
Whereas a national recession is identified by two quarters of decline, defining a global recession is more difficult, because developing nations are expected to have a higher GDP growth than developed nations. According to IMF, the real GDP growth of the emerging and developing countries is on an uptrend and that of advanced economies is on a downtrend since late 1980s. The world growth is projected to slow from 5% in 2007 to 3.75% in 2008 and to just over 2% in 2009. Downward revisions in GDP growth vary across regions. Among the most affected are commodity exporters, and countries with acute external financing and liquidity problems. Countries in East Asia (including China) have suffered smaller declines because their financial situations are more robust. They have benefited from falling commodity prices and they have initiated a shift toward macroeconomic policy easing.
The IMF estimates that global recessions seem to occur over a cycle lasting between 8 and 10 years. During what the IMF terms the past three global recessions of the last three decades, global per capita output growth was zero or negative.

Chaturanga (film)

Chaturanga ( "Four Chapters") is a 2008 Bengali film. Directed by Suman Mukherjee, the movie featured Rituparna Sengupta, Dhritiman Chaterji, Subrata Dutta, Joy Sengupta and Kabir Suman.
Plot.
Based on the novel by author Rabindranath Tagore, "Chaturanga" is about a love caught between conflicting worlds of ideas. Set in Colonial Bengal at the turn of the twentieth century, the film weaves a rich tapestry of crisscrossing desires and moralities.The lead protagonist Sachish fleets from radical positivism to religious mysticism in his quest for life's meaning. However, his search ultimately yields nothing but crushing disillusionment. This is because he cannot square his abstract ideals with the powerful presences of two women in his life. One of them is Damini, a young Hindu widow, and the other is Nanibala, the abandoned mistress of Sachish's own brother.Sachish tries to convince himself that Nanibala is simply a helpless woman who needs to be 'rescued' by him. Similarly, during his later religious phase, he pretends that the widow Damini is merely an enticement of Nature that must be avoided at all costs for spiritual salvation. Chaturanga thus becomes, after a point, a psychodrama of unbelievable cruelty. Nanibala becomes a victim of it because as a 'fallen woman' she can only be 'saved', but her humanity cannot be recognized. Damini is first given away by her dying husband, along with all her property, to a religious guru. She then falls in love with Sachish who can accept her only without her sexuality.
Music.
The songs, especially those from the Vaishnav tradition, are erotic. The divine is expressed in them through allegorical depictions of the illicit love between Krishna and Radha, who was actually his aunt. There is a radical side to this blend of eroticism and divinity. Radha's love for Krishna is beyond all social norms. It is directly expressed, without the priest or the Brahmin caste coming in between. When devotees sing and rejoice in that form of love, it is thus a popular and democratic process that defies caste divisions.

Anatoly Karatsuba

Anatoly Alexeevitch Karatsuba (; Grozny, Soviet Union, January 31, 1937 — Moscow, Russia, September 28, 2008) was a Russian mathematician working in the field of analytic number theory, p-adic numbers and Dirichlet series.
For most of his student and professional life he was associated with the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, defending a D.Sc. there entitled "The method of trigonometric sums and intermediate value theorems" in 1966. He later held a post at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences.
His textbook "Foundations of analytic number theory" went to two editions, 1975 and 1983.
His eponymous algorithm is a fast procedure for multiplying large numbers, a divide and conquer algorithm later asymptotically improved by the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm. The Karatsuba algorithm is the earliest known divide and conquer algorithm for multiplication and lives on as a special case of the Toom–Cook algorithm.
The main research works of Anatoly Karatsuba were published in more than 160 research papers and monographs.

Joint Dark Energy Mission

The Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) was an Einstein probe that planned to focus on investigating dark energy. JDEM was a partnership between NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy.
In August 2010, the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the National Science Foundation recommended the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission, a renamed JDEM-Omega proposal which has superseded SNAP, Destiny, and ADEPT, as the highest priority for development in the decade around 2020. This would be a 1.5-metre telescope with a 144-megapixel HgCdTe focal plane array, located at the L2 Lagrange point; the expected cost is around $1.6 billion.
Dark Energy Space Telescope.
The Dark Energy Space Telescope (Destiny), was a planned project by NASA and DOE, designed to perform precision measurements of the universe to provide an understanding of dark energy. The space observatory will derive the expansion of the universe by measuring up to 3,000 distant supernovae each year of its three-year mission lifetime, and will additionally study the structure of matter in the universe by measuring millions of galaxies in a weak gravitational lensing survey. The Destiny spacecraft features an optical telescope with a 1.65m primary mirror. The telescope images infrared light onto an array of solid-state detectors. The mission is designed to be deployed in a halo orbit about the sun-earth Lagrangian point.
The Destiny proposal has been superseded by the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope.
Supernova/Acceleration Probe.
The Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) Mission is expected to provide an understanding of the mechanism driving the acceleration of the universe and determine the nature of dark energy. To achieve these goals, the spacecraft needs to be able detect these supernovas when they are at their brightest moment. The mission is proposed as an experiment for Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM). JDEM is a partnership between NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy. The projected cost ranges from $500 million to $1 billion. The cost will be split between NASA and Department of Energy. The satellite observatory would be capable of measuring up to 2,000 distant supernovae each year of its three-year mission lifetime. SNAP will also observe the small distortions of light from distant galaxies to reveal more about the expansion history of the universe. The SNAP is still in the proposal stages, and has yet to receive final approval. Should it be approved, the hoped launch date is 2013.
To understand what is driving the acceleration of the universe, scientists need to see greater redshifts from supernovas than what is seen from Earth. The SNAP can detect redshifts of 1.7 from distant supernovas up to 10 billion light years away. At this distance, the acceleration of the universe will be easily seen. To measure the presence of dark energy, a process called weak lensing will be used.
The SNAP will use an optical setup called the three-mirror anastigmat. This consists of a main mirror with a diameter of 2 meters to take in light. It reflects this light to a second mirror. Then this light is transferred to two additional smaller mirrors which direct the light to the spacecraft's instruments. It will also contain 72 different cameras. 36 of them are able to detect visible light and the other 36 detect infrared light. Its cameras combined produces the equivalence of a 600 megapixel camera. The resolution of the camera is about 0.2 arcseconds in the visible spectrum and 0.3 arcseconds in the infrared spectrum. The SNAP will also have a spectrograph attached to it. The purpose of it is to detect what type of supernova SNAP is observing, determine the redshift, detect changes between different supernovas, and store supernova spectra for future reference.
JDEM has recognized several potential problems of the SNAP project:

<doc id="20250809" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20250809" title="Teen marriage">
Teen marriage

Teen marriage is typically defined as the union of two adolescents, joined in marriage from the age range of 13–19 years old. Many factors contribute to teen marriage such as love, teen pregnancy, religion, security, family and peer pressure, arranged marriage, economic and political reasons, social advancement, and cultural reasons. Studies have shown that teenage married couples are often less advantageous, may come from broken homes, may have little education and work low status jobs in comparison to those that marry after adolescence. 
Although a majority of teen marriages suffer from complications and often lead to divorce, some are successful. For example, in India, where teenagers are sometimes forced to marry by arrangement, more than 90% of these marriages will not end in divorce. In the United States, half of teen marriages dissolve within 15 years of the marriage. The rate of teen marriage, however, is decreasing due the many opportunities that are available now that previously were not available before. Presently, teen marriage is not widely accepted in much of the world. Teen marriage is most prevalent in culturally or geographically isolated parts of the world and it is decreasing where education is the focus of the population.
Background.
The legal status of circumstances surrounding teenage marriage vary from one area or era to the next. Marriage has often been used as a tool to create allegiances or agreements, rather than a link between two people in love.
Almost every country has a legal minimum age for marriage, which ranges from as low as 12 in some Latin American countries to as high as 22 in China. The age requirement is commonly 16 for women and 18 for men. Despite laws concerning the age of marriage, tradition usually takes precedence and marriage continues to occur at very young ages. In many African and Asian countries as much as two-thirds of teenage woman are or have been married. In many nations, marrying off a young daughter means one less mouth to feed and no fear of illegitimate children, a dishonor to the family. But these youthful brides often suffer physical and psychological damage, according to a UNICEF report. 
Historically, most marriages in western culture have had a late age of marriage and an emphasis on the nuclear family. The percentage of women ages 15–19 who are married in the United States is 3.9%, while in the Democratic Republic of the Congo the percentage is 74%. In the U.S., teenage marriages declined significantly after the mid-20th century, but experienced resurgence in the 1990s, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Census data from 2000 show that 4.5% of 15- to 19-year-olds were married, up from 3.4% in 1990. While that was an increase of almost 50%, it was still far below the 9.5% recorded in 1950.
Religious aspect.
The article "Religious Heritage and Teenage Marriage" suggests that many religions such as Pentecostalism, Fundamentalist Christianity, and other institutionalized sects give the message that leads parents and teens to view early marriage as the only acceptable means of culminating romantic relationships. It also became the tradition to the first generation. More recently, research shows that religion has slowed down the rates of teen marriage and teen pregnancy rate since 1991, a reversal of earlier trends.
Legal aspect.
In many countries, teen marriage laws are making it harder for teens to marry. In the United States, all but one state require that a couple be 18 in order to marry without parental permission. Nebraska sets the age of majority at 19. However, several states will waive this requirement if there is a pregnancy. However, teenage couples may still have to have court approval. A few states allow pregnant teens or teens who have already had a child to get married without parental consent. However, these couples must have permission from a court. Even with parental approval, many states require court approval when a person is 16 years old or less. 
In the Siriono culture of South America, a girl may marry before she reaches puberty. The Murnigin girl of Australia is likely to become a wife when her breasts first begin to develop. The Murmuring boy of Australia might marry for the first time when his beard begins to appear. A Lepcha girl in Tibet is sometimes married at eight years of age, while boys are often married when they are 12 years old.
Boys marry at 15 years of age or less in 10 percent of 58 societies. Another 42 percent marry between 16 and 19 years of age. Thirty-eight percent are married in their twenties, and 10 percent marry when they are 30 years of age. (Ayer) Scientists and psychologists made a discovery in 1963 that in traditional societies, boys and girls have usually begun to do serious work well before they reach puberty. Girls are often doing womanly work at a certain age: cooking, weaving, gardening, and taking care of their siblings from the age of six to the age of nine. Some girls have to do these chores at an even earlier age like three or four. Boys on the other hand, learn how to farm, herd, and hunt before they reach manhood. 
Some mothers and fathers attempt to let their children to choose their potential loved ones. However, about 70% of decisions regarding marriage of children are made by their parents. Parents who fail to marry a child at the proper age are thought to be neglecting their responsibilities. These parents usually have their reputations ruined. Across cultures, females tend to be married earlier than males. Boys are married later than girls in 85 percent of 45 cultures. In the remaining 15 percent, both sexes marry at a roughly the same age. The differential in age of marriage for males and females is from one to five years in 78 percent of 37 societies and between six and ten years in another 18 percent.
Results and Consequences.
Consequences.
According to the book of Eleanor H. Ayer, another situation that could lead teenagers to an early marriage is often unprotected sex, which could lead to a pregnancy. Other factors that also lead to marriage are love, lust, fear of losing their partner, abuse, extreme parental control, sexual harassment and step-family difficulties.
Results.
One in three teen marriages ends in divorce by the age of 25, which is no different than the statistics for adult marriage. Additionally, according to Bob and Sheri Stitof, "marriages and divorce rates have increased by 68 percent since 1995. Also, one out of every four teenagers have parents that are divorced."

Dario Herrera (born June 27, 1973) is a former Democratic politician from Nevada. Herrera was considered a rising star in the Democratic Party until his defeat for election to the United States House of Representatives in 2002 and his subsequent convictions on federal public corruption charges.
Political career.
Herrera grew up in Miami, Florida. He moved to Las Vegas in 1991 to attend the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Herrera began his political career in 1994 as campaign coordinator for Nevada Gov. Bob Miller. At the age of 23 Herrera was elected to the Nevada Assembly in 1996 and then to the Clark County Commission two years later. During this period he was told by then-Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros that he was a "star" and "going places."
In 2002 Herrera won the Democratic nomination in the newly created Nevada 3rd Congressional District. However during the campaign it was revealed that Herrera received a $50,000 contract from the Las Vegas Housing Authority "to do public relations work that the authority board members never knew about." Herrera lost the election to Republican state Sen. Jon Porter.
"Operation G-Sting" involvement and conviction.
Along with former Clark County commissioners Erin Kenny, Mary Kincaid-Chauncey, and several other local elected officials, Herrera became embroiled in a corruption investigation involving a Las Vegas strip club which became known as Operation G-Sting. In May 2006 Herrera was convicted of 17 counts of conspiracy, wire fraud and extortion stemming from charges that he and the other officials "used their public offices to further the interests of Michael Galardi, a strip club owner in Las Vegas. They solicited and accepted money, property, and services directly from Galardi and through co-defendant Lance Malone, another former county commissioner. The evidence demonstrated that members of the conspiracy concealed the payments they received from Galardi and failed to disclose the payments as required by law and their fiduciary duties as county commissioners." In August 2006 Herrera was sentenced to 50 months in federal prison, fined $15,000 and ordered to forfeit $60,000 in assets. Herrera declined to appeal his convictions.
In January 2007 Herrera began serving his sentence at the Florence Federal Correctional Complex in Florence, Colorado. Herrera's sentence was originally scheduled to end in early 2011.
Herrera was released in the spring of 2009 and is back working for the Loft 5 condo project in Las Vegas.

True Tunes News

True Tunes News was a magazine which covered alternative Christian music.
Background.
John J. Thompson founded True Tunes News out of his Wheaton, Illinois Christian record shop, True Tunes. The store itself, founded in 1989, with Chris Langill, was relatively unique because it focused exclusively on alternative Christian music at a time when Christian bookstores wouldn't carry products based on rock, hip hop, or other hard forms of music. In 1995 Thompson founded a live music club for Christian acts called True Tunes Upstairs. In 1997 the store, magazine, and related assets were bought by the Charlottesville, VA based company Journey Communications. Journey closed the shop in early 1998 citing lagging sales due to the spread of alternative Christian music to larger retailers, and turned operations to the printed magazine and the internet.
Despite competition from "CCM", "HM", and "7ball" magazines "True Tunes News" was extremely successful, achieving a worldwide circulation of 50,000 issues by 1993. This made it the largest Christian rock magazine by circulation, a title it held through the late 1990s. In the late 1990s the magazine ran into financial trouble when several of the record labels whose advertising financed it, went defunct. When it ceased publishing the editors turned to the internet for distribution, but this effort has now been disbanded.

<doc id="20250928" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20250928" title="Freight equalization policy">
Freight equalization policy

Freight equalization policy was adopted by the government of India to facilitate the equal growth of industry all over the country. This meant a factory could be set up anywhere in India and the transportation of minerals would be subsidised by the central government. The policy was introduced in 1952, and remained in force until 1993.
The policy hurt the economic prospects of the mineral-rich states like Bihar (including present-day Jharkhand), West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh (including present-day Chhattisgarh) and Orissa, since it weakened the incentives for private capital to establish production facilities in these areas. As a result of the policy, businesses preferred setting up industrial locations closer to the coastal trade hubs and markets in other parts of the country.
Rationale.
The freight equilization concept made "essential" items available at same prices throughout the country. These items included coal, steel and cement among many others. The idea was to achieve promote balanced regional development of industries throughout the country.
Results.
Industrialists interested in setting up plants anywhere in the country would get coal, iron ore, aluminium etc. at the same price as they used to get in the mineral-rich states. A factory could be set up anywhere in the country and the transportation of minerals would be subsidised by the central government. As a result, there was growth of heavy and middle level-industry outside the mineral-rich regions of the country.
The policy took away the competitive advantage of the eastern parts of the country, and benefited the western, southern and northern regions. According to Professor Stuart Corbridge, the policy discouraged the establishment of "resource-processing industries in eastern India, as opposed to the extractive industries, which seem to have imposed on the region a version of the 'resource curse' noted more frequently in sub-Saharan Africa."
In the western region, the policy especially benefited the coastal states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat. The finance minister T. T. Krishnamachari also equalized the freight, which greatly benefited the cement manufacturers in the South Indian states, as limestone and dolomite became cheaper to transport from North India. The North Indian areas that benefited from the policy included Delhi, its surrounding districts and Punjab.
The sufferers of this policy were the states of West Bengal, Bihar (including present-day Jharkhand), Madhya Pradesh (including present-day Chhattisgarh) and Orissa. These states lost their competitive advantage of holding the minerals as the factories could now be set up anywhere in India. This was not the case in the pre-independence era when the major business houses like the Tatas and the Dalmias set up industries in these states, and most of the engineering industry was located in the state of West Bengal. Even after the removal of the policy in the early 1990s, these states could not catch up with the more industrialized states. In 1996, the Commerce & Industry minister of West Bengal complained that "the removal of the freight equalization and licensing policies cannot compensate for the ill that has already been done".

Philippine All Stars

The Philippine All-Stars is a Philippine hip-hop dance group. They won the 2006 and 2008 World Hip Hop Dance Championships. They were formed on 2005 by twelve individuals that were working in the Manila underground Hip-hop scene. They also joined the “Artists Revolution: 365 days to change” campaign which asks the Filipino voters to be more critical in choosing their political leaders in the coming 2010 elections.
History.
The Philippine Allstars was started in 2005 by Twelve friends who wanted to collectively represent their country in the World Hip-Hop Championships held in the US. That year after taking first in the Maximum Groovity II, National Hip-Hop Open, they proudly placed sixth in the World. In 2006, Allstars put the Philippines on the map of Hip-hop dance in becoming the first Asian country to win back-to-back World Gold titles in the International Hip-hop Open d’Ítalia in Turin, Italy and in the World Hip-Hop Dance Championships in Los Angeles, California. The next year, the group took Bronze in the same competition and also won Team of the Year from V.Ent’s First Annual Dance Awards. Now in 2008, they came back strong again and took Gold in the World Hip-Hop Dance Championships held in Las Vegas, Nevada.
The group hopes to elevate the status of dancers in the Philippines, because for too long have dancers been considered second-rate performers. Through their efforts and many talented others, they want to show that dancing is a great art form and should be more respected and rewarded than what is currently being offered by the entertainment industry. They share in a movement that strives to unite and inspire this generation through Faith, Hip-hop, and One Love. Lastly, a goal of the group is to teach and help under-privileged kids through dancing and inspiring them to strive for something more than what they have been told they can achieve. The Allstars advocates for Gawad Kalinga, has taught in US Embassy Outreach Programs, has spoken and performed for the QC Detention Cell, and participated in programs such as Pathways Workshop and Walk for Education. The Allstars are featured in many events, concerts, tours, TV guestings, commercials, music videos, films, and print ads.
In February 2010, they opened their first dance school, the Allstars Dance School, located in San Juan city Philippines.
The dance school is the realization of the Allstars' ultimate goal, and is their greatest achievement to date.
Each member contributes to its authentic Hip-Hop flavor that combines the different styles of Break-dancing, Krumping and Freestyle. Each members contributes to its authentic Hip-Hop flava that combines the different styles of Popping, Locking, Break-dancing, Krumping, Freestyling, House and other Old and New Skool genres.

National Museum of History of Azerbaijan () is the largest museum of Azerbaijan, located in Baku, in the former mansion of Azerbaijani oil magnate and philanthropist Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev. It was founded in 1920.
History.
The building of the Museum was built in 1893–1902. The Italian Renaissance-style mansion is immense and takes up an entire city block. There are four floors in some parts of the building. It was designed by Polish architect Józef Gosławski. 
When the Red Army entered Baku in 1920, Taghiyev's residence – like that of other wealthy oil barons – was immediately confiscated. Under a resolution of the USSR People's Commissariat, the residence was established as a museum in June 1920, only a few months after the Bolsheviks took Baku.
Architecture.
On the second floor of Taghiyev's residence, side by side there are two major ballrooms. One is based on Oriental designs (Mauritanian) style and the other, on Occidental design. The Oriental Room has enormous plate glass windows, gilded arches, highly ornamental walls, ceilings and chandeliers. The lines in the Occidental Room are more perpendicular to each other – rectangular.
According to photographs that are about 90 years old, one of the most elaborate rooms was Taghiyev's wife's boudoir (private sitting room). All of the movable furniture and paintings in this room have disappeared. Nothing remains today except the ornate mirrored mosaic ceiling. During the Soviet period, four layers of white paint were applied over the highly decorative floral designs on the walls. Still in the main halls of the residence, the original paint has withstood the passage of time incredibly well. The paint was made of finely ground egg shell as was the practice of artists of Byzantine icons. Nearly 100 years later, the original colors with their subtlety and sophistication have neither faded nor chipped.
Departments.
The museum has more than 2000 exhibits and includes the following departments:

O-o-h Child

"O-o-h Child" is a 1970 single recorded by Chicago soul family group the Five Stairsteps and released it on the Buddah label. Previously the Five Stairsteps had had peripheral success recording in Chicago with Curtis Mayfield: when Mayfield's workload precluded his continuing to work with the group they were reassigned to Stan Vincent, an in-house producer for Buddah Records who had recently scored a Top Ten hit with the Lou Christie single "I'm Gonna Make You Mine". The Five Stairsteps' debut collaboration with Vincent was originally formatted with the group's rendition of "Dear Prudence" as the A-side with Vincent's original composition "O-o-h Child" as B-side: however "O-o-h Child" broke out in the key markets of Philadelphia and Detroit to rise as high as #8 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in the summer of 1970: the track's R&B chart impact was more muted with a #14 peak although "O-o-h Child" is now regarded as a "soft soul" classic. The Five Stairsteps' only pop Top 40 hit, "O-o-h Child" would be the group's last R&B top 40 hit (they had several top 40 R&B hits in the 1960s) until 1976's "From Us to You". Included on the band's "The Stairsteps" album from 1970, it has become the Stairsteps' signature song and has inspired more than twenty covers since its release. The song featured various members including lone female member and eldest sister Alohe, brothers Keni, Dennis, James, and lead singer Clarence Burke, Jr. singing in various parts of the song. 
The lyrics tell the listener that "things are gonna get easier" in times of strife. The song's uplifting message helped the song to become popular among pop and rhythm and blues audiences when it was released. 
The song is ranked #402 on the "Rolling Stone" magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Patrick David Wall

Patrick David "Pat" Wall (25 April 1925 – 8 August 2001) was a leading British neuroscientist described as 'the world's leading expert on pain' and best known for the Gate control theory of pain.
Early life and academia.
Wall was born in Nottingham on 25 April 1925 to Thomas Wall, the director of education for Middlesex, and his wife Ruth Cresswell. He was educated at St Paul's School in London. He matriculated to Oxford University, studying medicine at Christ Church, where he became interested in pain. He published his first two papers, in the prominent science journals "Brain" and "Nature", at the age of 21. While at Oxford he had also helped found the British Medical Students' Journal, partially to help campaign for the introduction of the NHS. He graduated in 1948, by which time he had published three papers in prominent science journals. After graduating, he spent a short time treating holocaust survivors and refugees in mainland Europe, and then moved to the United States where he took up a position as an instructor at the Yale School of Medicine investigating the use of lobotomies as a method of controlling depression.
Work in the United States.
He remained as an instructor until 1950, when he was offered a position as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. He moved again in 1953 to serve as an instructor at Harvard University, and again in 1957 to work as an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was promoted to full professor in 1960, and while at the Institute met Ronald Melzack, who was to become a long-time collaborator. At Melzack's urging they wrote a paper on the Gate control theory of pain and published it in "Brain" in 1962; according to Wall it was read by around three people. After expanding and rewriting the article they republished it as "Pain Mechanisms: a new theory" in "Science" in 1965 where it drew wider attention, with mostly negative comments. The paper was looked at in a new light after Wall collaborated with Bill Sweet to produce the Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator, developed along the lines of the theory. The effective working of the device validated Wall and Melzack's paper, and Wall gained acclaim as a leading neuroscientist. In 1965 he published TRIO - The Revolting Intellectuals' Organisation, a thriller novel. In 1973 he acted as the scientific study officer for the launch of the International Association for the Study of Pain, and subsequently acted as the first editor of its medical journal, "Pain".
Return to Britain.
In 1967 he returned to Britain due to threats from the CIA that refusal to disclose the political affiliations of his research group could jeopardise his funding, and took up a position as Professor of Anatomy at University College London, under JZ Young. While there he was given the nickname of "Mr. Pat". Thanks to his reputation as a neuroscientist the laboratories at UCL attracted a large number of students and researchers, and his lectures were well received by both students and fellow lecturers. In 1972 he travelled to Jerusalem, and subsequently held a chair at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he taught for several months a year.
In 1982 he published "The Challenge of Pain" with Melzack followed by a second collaboration a year later with "The Textbook of Pain", which is currently in its fifth edition. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Physicians in 1984 and the Royal Society in 1989; by this point he had been repeatedly short-listed for a Nobel Prize. His left-wing views and the enemies that came with them were an apparent reason for his overdue election as a Fellow of the Royal Society, along with the society's reluctance to elect medical officials. He was awarded the Sherrington Medal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1988, and in 1992 he was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Anaesthesiologists. He retired the same year and continued experimental research at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School. In 1999 he was awarded the Royal Medal 'in recognition of his fundamental contributions to our knowledge of the somatosensory system and, in particular, pain mechanisms'.
Death.
In 1996 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer after collapsing while on holiday in Cork. After treatment he went into remission, which held for five years; the cancer returned in 2001, and after a kidney operation on 2 August he discharged himself on 8 August so he could die at home. While suffering from cancer he had published the book "Pain: The Science of Suffering". His body was left for medical dissection.
Personal life.
Wall was married three times; first to Betty Tucker on 10 August 1950, an artist and poet whom he divorced in 1973, second to Vera Ronnen on 26 August 1976, an artist from Jerusalem whom he also divorced and finally to Mary McLellan on 6 May 1999, who survived him. Wall was a chain-smoker, and enjoyed bird-watching outside of his work, although he preferred not to talk about his personal life. An exception to this was politics; Wall was fervently left-wing, and had set up various student and other organisations to support various causes.

List of premiers of Nunavut

The Canadian territory of Nunavut was formed on April 1, 1999 through the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act. Nunavut, since its formation, has had a consensus government. In a consensus government, the premier is elected by the non-partisan members of the Legislative Assembly. Prior to April 1, 1999, the land that Nunavut occupies was part of the Northwest Territories.
History.
The territory's first premier, Paul Okalik, was elected after the 1999 general elections. He was re-elected to a second term after the 2004 general elections. Although Okalik was re-elected to a third term after the 2008 general elections in the Iqaluit West riding, he was defeated by newly elected MLA Eva Aariak in the premiership vote on November 14. On 15 November, 2013, Peter Taptuna beat out Paul Okalik and Paul Quassa for the position of premier.
Living former premiers.
As of November 2013, both former premiers are alive. Since the creation of the office in 1999, no former premier has died.

Information gain ratio

Information gain ratio is between 0 and 1, cf. ordinary information gain
Information Gain Calculation.
Let formula_1 be the set of all attributes and formula_2 the set of all training examples,
formula_3 with 
formula_4 defines the value of a specific example formula_5 for attribute formula_6, formula_7 specifies the entropy.
The information gain for an attribute formula_6 is defined as follows:
formula_9
The information gain is equal to the total entropy for an attribute if for each of the attribute values a unique classification can be made for the result attribute. In this case the relative entropies subtracted from the total entropy are 0.
Intrinsic Value Calculation.
The intrinsic value for a test is defined as follows:
formula_10
Information Gain Ratio Calculation.
The information gain ratio is just the ratio between the information gain and the intrinsic value:
formula_11
Advantages.
Information gain ratio biases the decision tree against considering attributes with a large number of distinct values. So it solves the drawback of information gain—namely, information gain applied to attributes that can take on a large number of distinct values might learn the training set too well. For example, suppose that we are building a decision tree for some data describing a business's customers. Information gain is often used to decide which of the attributes are the most relevant, so they can be tested near the root of the tree. One of the input attributes might be the customer's credit card number. This attribute has a high information gain, because it uniquely identifies each customer, but we do "not" want to include it in the decision tree: deciding how to treat a customer based on their credit card number is unlikely to generalize to customers we haven't seen before.

Zee Avi

Zee Avi (born Izyan Alirahman, also known as KokoKaina),PBK is a Malaysian singer-songwriter, guitarist, and ukulele player. She hails from the oil-rich town of Miri, located in Sarawak, Malaysia on the island of Borneo. She moved to Kuala Lumpur at 12 and at 17, she taught herself to play the guitar. She studied fashion design at American InterContinental University in London, but as it turned out, fashion was not her true calling. She claims that she was "bred to become a lawyer" and even studied law at one point. Avi also has a penchant for art. In fact, her artwork is featured on the CD of her second album. She also produced three art pieces for a charity project with Pledge Music.
Breakthrough.
In September 2007, Avi posted a video of her first song "Poppy" on YouTube for one of her friends who had missed her first performance in Kuala Lumpur. The friend convinced Avi to leave the video online even after he had seen it, and soon she received positive feedback. This inspired her to put more videos on YouTube.
On the eve of her 22nd birthday (2007), Avi posted what was supposed to be her final video "No Christmas For Me". The next day, YouTube put the spotlight on her video and Avi's mailbox was bombarded with more than 3,000 e-mails and a slew of offers from record labels.
After discovering her video, Patrick Keeler of The Raconteurs, passed the link to Ian Montone, the manager of The White Stripes, The Shins, The Raconteurs, M.I.A. and others. Montone then passed her music on to Emmett Malloy, who signed her to Brushfire Records, a record company that is partly owned by Jack Johnson. And the rest, as they say, is history. "No Christmas For Me" turned out to be her first official song with Brushfire Records. It was featured on Brushfire Records's 2008 charity Christmas album "This Warm December: A Brushfire Holiday (Vol. 1)".
Career Highlights.
Avi's self-titled debut album was released on May 19, 2009. The album was co-produced by Brushfire Records and Ian Montone's Monotone Records. On the day of the release, YouTube featured her on the front page in Spotlight: Music Tuesday. A day after that, she performed to a full house at the famed Roxy Theater in West Hollywood. The album went on to become the ninth best album of 2009 according to the Associated Press. She made her US television debut on June 18, 2009, performing her debut single "Bitter Heart" live on Last Call With Carson Daly.
Her second album "Ghostbird" was released on August 23, 2011. "The Book Of Morris Johnson" was the first single off her sophomore effort. "Ghostbird" topped the US Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart and spawned hits like "Swell Window" and "Concrete Wall" after both songs were featured in Season 5 of the hit television series Gossip Girl. Avi has the distinction of being the first Malaysian singer to have albums on the US Billboard Hot 200 Albums chart and top a Billboard chart (Heatseekers Album).
She toured the United States with Pete Yorn from June to August 2009, the final leg being at the Music Box, Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood, California on August 27, 2009. She opened for the multi-talented Jack Johnson during his concert at the Greek Theater, UC Berkeley on October 6, 2010, and had the honor of collaborating with Johnson on a live mash-up of their respective hits "Just You And Me" and "Breakdown". She also opened for Grammy-winning singer/songwriter and feminist icon Ani DiFranco at the Chameleon Club in Lancaster, Pennsylvania on October 21, 2011 to mark the 20th anniversary of World Cafe.
Avi has performed sets at some of the most celebrated music tours and festivals, namely SXSW in Austin, Texas (March, 2009), Bonnaroo in Tennessee (June, 2009), San Francisco's Outside Lands (August, 2009), Byron Bay Bluesfest in Australia (April, 2010), Lilith Fair in Ohio, New Jersey and Massachusetts (July, 2010), Mountain Jam in New York (May–June, 2012) and Rainforest World Music Festival in Kuching, Sarawak (July 2012).
She toured Asia in November 2011, performing in Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei, Singapore, Bali, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Miri. This was followed by a US East Coast Tour in February 2012, with gigs in New York, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Maryland and North Carolina. In September 2012, she performed in six cities during her California Tour.
In December 2012, Avi was conferred the state order and medal of Pegawai Bintang Kenyalang (Officer of the Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak) for her service to the state of Sarawak by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri (Head of State). The award is the Fifth Rank of the Darjah Yang Amat Mulia Bintang Kenyalang Sarawak (Most Illustrious Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak).
Avi will be releasing "Nightlight", a 9-track album consisting of covers for children, in April 2014. The album, which was recorded in Woodstock, New York within a span of just four days, includes covers of "The Rainbow Connection" (Kermit the Frog), "Circle Game" (Joni Mitchell) and the lullaby classic "Hush, Little Baby". Avi released covers of The Velvet Underground's "Who Loves The Sun" and Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy" in February 2014, as teasers for her upcoming record.
Musical Influences.
Avi has often been called an old soul and it comes as no surprise because she is a huge fan of swing bands, Gershwin and America jazz from the 20s. She has been likened to Ella Fitzgerald many a times and one writer called her "the next heiress in the bloodline of young women with supernaturally classic voices".
She also describes herself as a "rock lover at heart". Her musical preference is pretty diverse, listening to everything from The Carpenters to The Cranberries. She draws inspiration from eccentrics Cat Power, Regina Spektor, Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Jolie Holland, Daniel Johnston and Chris Garneau, to jazz greats Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald, and classics like Velvet Underground and Led Zeppelin.

Truman Balcony

The Truman Balcony is the second-floor balcony of the Executive Residence of the White House, which overlooks the south lawn. It was completed in March 1948, during the presidency of Harry S. Truman.
Controversy over construction plans.
Truman's plans to build a balcony off the Yellow Oval Room were controversial. He argued that the addition of a balcony would provide shade for the first floor portico, avoiding the need for awnings, and would balance the White House's south face by breaking up the long verticals created by the columns. Critics of the proposal, including members of the Commission of Fine Arts, argued that the Classic Greek style of the building would be undermined in order to create a leisure space for the First Family. The Commission's chairman, civil engineer and landscape architect Gilmore David Clarke, wrote to Truman to voice his opposition to the balcony. Truman responded, restating his belief that the residence would be enhanced by the project especially as it presented an opportunity to replace unattractive awnings, which he said collected dirt and constituted an eyesore, with wooden shades that could be rolled up under the new balcony.
Contemporary political cartoonists satirized the President's balcony project, suggesting that it might even cost him the 1948 presidential election.
Construction and subsequent history.
Plans for the balcony were approved by architect William Adams Delano. No request was made to Congress for the $16,050.74 cost of constructing the balcony, as Truman had saved a sufficient sum from his household account. Once the balcony had been completed, several of those who had opposed the project wrote to the President acknowledging that the balcony had in fact improved the south face of the Residence.
In a September, 2012 interview in "Vanity Fair", President Barack Obama listed the balcony as his and his wife Michelle Obama's favorite spot in the White House.

History of rugby union matches between Australia and New Zealand

The first clash in rugby union between Australia and New Zealand took place in a test match on 15 August 1903 in Sydney, New South Wales. On that occasion, New Zealand won by 22-3.
Since 1931, they have competed for the Bledisloe Cup, named after Lord Bledisloe, who donated the trophy.
Rugby Championship era (2012-).
Starting in 2012 the Tri Nations competition was renamed The Rugby Championship, and now includes Argentina.
Tri Nations and the professional era (1996-2011).
The professional era in rugby union began in 1995, marked by creation of the SANZAR group (a combination of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia) which was formed with the purpose of selling TV rights for two new competitions, the domestic Super 12 competition and the Tri-Nations.
The first Tri-Nations was contested in 1996, with New Zealand winning all four of their Tests to take the trophy.
In 2000 in Sydney, a record crowd of 109,874 witnessed the "Greatest ever Rugby Match" when a Jonah Lomu try sealed an All Blacks win over the Wallabies 39-35. The All Blacks had led 24-nil after 11 minutes only to see the Wallabies draw level at 24-all by halftime. Only for Lomu to score for the All Blacks to seal a fantastic match. Just weeks after, the Bledisloe was retained by the Wallabies when John Eales kicked a goal from the sideline in the final moments of the match.
Another one of the most dramatic matches was played on 1 September 2001 at Stadium Australia, in what would be Wallaby great John Eales' last ever test. The Wallabies were hoping to send their skipper off in a grand style. A fairy tale ending was looking possible in the first half as the Wallabies took a 19-6 lead over the All Blacks. However, tries for Doug Howlett and Pita Alatini, along with Andrew Mehrtens kicking, saw the All Blacks back in front 26-22. Then, in the dying moments of the game No.8 Toutai Kefu scored the winning try for the Wallabies. 
In 2008, a Bledisloe Cup match was played in Hong Kong, which New Zealand won 19-14. It was rumoured that the United States and Japan would host future Bledisloe Cup matches, and these rumours proved true in the case of Japan, as Tokyo hosted a 2009 Bledisloe match.
The first two Tests of the 2010 series saw the All Blacks extend their winning streak over the Wallabies to 10 games. (Australia's last previous win came on 26 July 2008 at Sydney.) The third and fourth tests were extremely tight affairs, both being won by late tries. In the Sydney test on 11 September, converted tries by Richie McCaw and Kieran Read in the last 13 minutes allowed the All Blacks to overcome a 9-22 deficit. The win saw New Zealand complete a 100% record in the 2010 Tri-Nations. On 30 October 2010 the sides contested the now-customary fourth annual Bledisloe Cup test at a neutral venue. As in 2009, the match was played in Hong Kong, and as on 11 September the game was won with a dramatic late comeback. On this occasion the Wallabies, having led early in the match, found themselves 19-24 down as the hooter went, but with possession in the All Black 22. The Wallabies recycled through numerous phases of possession, until finally the ball was passed wide to James O'Connor, who beat the scrambling All Black defence to touch down and level the scores. The 20-year old winger then kicked the resulting conversion to win the match for the Wallabies, ending New Zealand's recent domination of the fixture.
Results.
Post War (1946-1974).
The first Test following World War Two was played at Carisbrook, Dunedin between Australia and New Zealand in 1946, which New Zealand won 31–8. Australia did not win on the three match tour; beaten 20–0 by New Zealand Maori, and then losing 14–10 to the All Blacks the following week.
The 1949 tour witnessed an infamous All Blacks record – the loss of two Test matches on the same day. This was made possible because South Africa were touring New Zealand at the same time. On the afternoon of 3 September New Zealand captained by J. B. (Johnny) Smith was beaten 11–6 by The Wallabies in Wellington. On 23 September New Zealand also lost their second Test, 16–9, which gave the Wallabies the Bledisloe Cup for the first time.
Between wars.
Australia's last Test before World War I was against New Zealand in July 1914. The sports authorities in Australia decided it was unpatriotic to play rugby while thousands of young Australian men were being sent overseas to fight. This resulted in competitions all but closed down in New South Wales and Queensland. In Queensland regular competitions did not commence again until 1928. As a result players switched to rugby league in large numbers.
Even though there was no Australia/New Zealand game after the war before 1929, 24 games were held between New South Wales and New Zealand from 1920 to 1928. The results were 18 victories against 6 for the All Blacks with 16 games taking place in Sydney, New South Wales (most of them at the Royal Agricultural Society Ground) and the rest in New Zealand. Those games are counted as Australia/New Zealand on the IRB website.
Also 1931 saw the first game played competing for the Bledisloe Cup.
Pre World War I.
The first Test between Australia and New Zealand was played on 15 August 1903 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Despite the Wallabies losing 22–3 this tour greatly increased the popularity of rugby and large crowds started attending grade matches in Sydney and Brisbane. New Zealand winger Billy Wallace scored 13 of their 22 points.

Philippe Grandrieux

Philippe Grandrieux (born 1954) is a French film director.
Biography.
Grandrieux was born in Saint-Étienne. He studied film at the INSAS (Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle) in Belgium. He exhibited his first video work at "Galerie Albert Baronian", Bruxelles. 
In the 1980s, he worked in collaboration with the French Institut National de l’Audiovisuel (INA) and the television channel La Sept/Arte where he helped develop new cinematographic forms and formats that called into question some basic principles of film writing: for instance, the conventions behind documentary, information and film essays. In 1990, he created the film research lab “Live” which produced one hour long sequences by Thierry Kuntzel, Robert Kramer and Robert Frank... 
Since 2005, programs devoted to Grandrieux’s features ("Sombre", "La Vie nouvelle", "Un lac"), installations, video, documentary work and shorts have been broadcast all over the world.
2012 / 2013 Philippe Grandrieux is Visiting Fiction Film Professor at Harvard University (USA) / In progress, a feature film Fever and a film/installation Meurtrière.
Work.
Grandrieux’s work covers several cinematographic fields : TV experimentation, video art, research movie, film essay, documentary and museum exhibition. His uncompromised vision of Art, leads him to push the boundaries of the cinematographic fields he is working on. As a consequence, he is always producing an inventive and radical cinema. His first two full-feature movies "Sombre" (which won an award at the Locarno Film Festival) and "La Vie Nouvelle" ("A New Life") are examples of Grandrieux’s creativity in photography, sound and narration. Following the work of Teinosuke Kinugasa, Jean Epstein and Pier Paolo Pasolini who were constantly looking for and inventing new narrative forms that would only fit films, Grandrieux’s films, deriving from horror movies and experimental movies, give the viewer intense sensorial experiences. His goal is to make the viewer psychologically involved in his movies. Its films actually express a whole world of energies based on sensations and affects despite a linear narration and an iconography that relies on archetypes that refer to the archaic images of the fairy tale and the legend. Tim Palmer situates Grandrieux's work within an ongoing tendency of a cinema of the body, linked to other filmmakers such as Marina de Van, Diane Bertrand, Damien Odoul.
For his soundtrack, he worked with Alan Vega (on "Sombre") and with the musicians, poets and performers of the band “Etant Donnés” (on "A New Life"). 
The American actor Zachary Knighton played the main character with Anna Mouglalis. The writer Eric Vuillard also participated in the writing of the script of "A New Life". A part of the email exchange between Grandrieux and Vuillard about the script has been published in the French film review "Trafic".

This book including a DVD of "La Vie nouvelle".
The psychanalist Jean-Claude Polack declares about Grandrieux’s movies that they “carefully try to understand the exact inner-working of one’s psychic, and more especially the part that deals with desire and transformation. How does desire work? What are the elements that this energy-matter is using to expand its empire? What are the social repressions that desire has to face? Unlike Pasolini who is really interested in the way that society is theatrically transforming the ceremony of predating into a show, there is here an experimental cinema; it is true; that is trying to register, thanks to the camera, what humans eyes would never be able to see in order to deconstruct and analyze reality. Grandrieux’s films are analytical films, like a microscope, that give the viewer the possibility to see more accurately what is movement, emotion, sensation, colour, darkness and the emergence of the image (either material or thought). What is the process that enables something to become an image in the dark? Why can this process only be seen as a threat?”
In 2006, Grandrieux appeared in Sarah Bertrand’s documentary "There is no direction".
In 2007, the singer Marilyn Manson, who admits having seen "La Vie nouvelle" several times, asked Grandrieux to direct his video-clip for his song "Putting Holes in Happiness" that belongs to the album "Eat Me, Drink Me".
In 2008, Japan paid homage to Grandrieux’s work, thanks to the French Ambassy, in the famous Uplink movie theater of Tokyo, under the title "Extreme Love - around Philippe Grandrieux".
The same year, the Tate Modern of London, along the retrospective « PARADISE NOW ! Essential French Avant-Garde cinema 1890-2008 », played "Putting Holes in Happiness", "A New Life", "The Late Season" and an excerpt of Un Lac (A Lake), his latest movie, which was not completed back then.
Un Lac, was ready for the 65th Venice Film Festival (2008) where he won a Special Mention in the Orrizzonti Section which rewards movies that initiate new cinematographic trends.
In 2011, his documentary "It May Be That Beauty Has Strengthened Our Resolve - Masao Adachi" (PG co-author of the project with Nicole Brenez) has been programmed in more than 35 festivals… and was awarded at: CPH:DOX Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival / Denmark.
The "NEW:VISION AWARD" that aims at promoting the experimental documentary in the field between documentary and art was given to Philippe Grandrieux's documentary about the Japanese filmmaker Masao Adachi. The jury highlighted the film's interweaving of Adachi's aesthetic concerns with the social and political histories he lived through. 'Rather than a typical director/subject relationship, this is a collaboration between both directors, where authorship moves back and forth,' the jury's motivation said."
Awarded also in June 2012 at: Festival Côté Court, Pantin, Seine-Saint-Denis, France: "GRAND PRIX EXPÉRIMENTAL - ESSAI - ART VIDÉO"
2012, Philippe Grandrieux most recent film/installation "White Epilepsy" has been programmed at FID Marseille, UNDERDOX Munich, FNC Montréal within a retrospective devoted to PG with all his features, documentaries… and in 2013 at the IFFR Rotterdam, LINCOLN CENTER New York, FICUNAM Mexico then Istanbul, Lima, Edinburgh, Wroclaw...
His work has been influenced by the work of Edmond Bernhard, his teacher at the INSAS, Murnau, Robert Bresson, Jean-Marie Straub, Danièle Huillet, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Stan Brakhage and also by his readings of Marc-Aurèle, Spinoza and Gilles Deleuze’s work.

AIDS orphan

An AIDS orphan is a child who became an orphan because one or both parents died from AIDS.
In statistics from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the term is used for a child whose mother has died due to AIDS before the child's 15th birthday, regardless of whether the father is still alive. As a result of this definition, one study estimated that 80% of all AIDS orphans still have one living parent.
There are 70,000 new AIDS orphans a year. By the year 2010, it is estimated that over 20 million children will be orphaned by AIDS.
Because AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active, AIDS-related deaths are often people who are their family's primary wage earners. The resulting AIDS orphans frequently depend on the state for care and financial support, particularly in Africa.
The highest number of orphans due to AIDS alive in 2007 was in South Africa (although the definition of AIDS orphan in South African statistics includes children up to the age of 18 who have lost either biological parent). In 2005 the highest number of AIDS orphans as a percentage of all orphans was in Zimbabwe.

Optoelectrofluidics

Optoelectrofluidics, also known as optically induced electrohydrodynamics, refers to the study of the motions of particles or molecules and their interactions with optically-induced electric field and the surrounding fluid.
This concept includes electrothermal vortex, electrophoresis, dielectrophoresis, and electroosmosis induced by combination of optical and electrical energy or by optical-electrical energy transfer.
In 1995, an electrothermal vortices induced by a strong IR (infrared) laser projected into an electric field have been utilized to concentrate microparticles and molecules. In 2000, UV(ultraviolet) pattern projected onto ITO (indium tin oxide) electrode has been applied for patterning colloidal particles. Illumination of the ITO electrode by UV light results in a small increase in the current from the generation of electron-hole pairs at the ITO/water interface. In 2005, optoelectronic tweezers (OET), wherein a photoconductive material was utilized to induce electric field using the optical decrement of electrical resistance on a partially illuminated area, has been reported. After that, many researches in several view-points have been performed as below.

SS John Morgan

SS "John Morgan" was a World War II liberty ship built by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation at their Bethlehem-Fairfield yard at Baltimore, Maryland, and launched on 4 May 1943.
However, on 1 June 1943, during its maiden voyage "John Morgan" collided with the tanker off Cape Henry on the coast of Virginia. The "John Morgan" broke in two and sank immediately at position , but started fires aboard the "Montana". The , engaged in gunnery practice in Chesapeake Bay, was sent to investigate. She sent a party aboard "Montana" to assist in extinguishing the fires, but recalled them after discovering that "Montana" was also carrying ammunition. Soon afterwards and arrived, and circled the area looking for survivors, but recovered only 12 bodies.
The wreck.
The ship lies in approximately of water. It is largely broken up, but the bow and a structure known as the "hospital" are still recognizable. The ship was on the United States lend-lease program and was loaded with war supplies such as Valentine tanks, P-39s, and large amounts of ammunition.

Nosokinetics

Nosokinetics is the science/subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in health and social care systems." Nosokinetics" brings together the Greek words for "noso": disease and "kinetics": movement.
Black box models are currently used to plan changes in health and social care systems. These input-output models overlook the process of inpatient care, as a result suboptimal decisions are made. Nosokinetics, (analogous to Pharmacokinetics), seeks to develop dynamic methods which measure and model the process of inpatient care. The aim is to develop a scientific base to underpin the planning of sustainable health and social care systems.
Establishment.
Nosokinetics is a new "science" that was established in the UK in the early 1990s by Prof Peter H Millard after publishing his PhD thesis. In 2004 Nosokinetics group newsletter was established.
Origin.
Prof Peter H Millard writes about Nosokinetics : "If the random forces of wind and tide can make such a beautiful statue (referring to an iceberg), how much better could mankind do if a new science was developed which explains the complex processes of health and social care. Until new methods of planning health and social care services to meet the needs of an ageing population are introduced, service delivery will stumble on from crisis to crisis. The world population is ageing and sustainable systems of health care need to be developed."
He has established the nosokinetics group of interested researchers. The group collaborates to organize conferences and disseminates news of nosokinetics and other researchers' research and practical use of modelling to enhance decision making in health and social care systems.
Network.
The Nosokinetics Group has succeeded in attracting a lot of researchers. Nosokinetics interested people are present in many countries including Australia, UK & Egypt. They are from different disciplines ranging from health care providers to management scientists. The news related to nosokinetics is shared to the network through the bimonthly newsletter "Nosokinetics News" which helps to communicate papers, conferences and events of interest to the Nosokinetics network.

Lorglumide (CR-1409) is a drug which inhibits gastrointestinal motility and reduces gastric secretions, acting as a cholecystokinin antagonist, with fairly high selectivity for the CCKA subtype. It has been suggested as a potential treatment for a variety of gastrointestinal problems including stomach ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia, constipation and pancreatitis, as well as some forms of cancer, but animal and human testing has produced inconsistent results and no clear therapeutic role has been established, although it is widely used in scientific research.

Crown International

Crown International, or Crown Audio, is a manufacturer of audio electronics, and is a subsidiary of Harman International Industries. Today the company is known primarily for its power amplifiers, but has also manufactured microphones, a line of commercial audio products as well as digital audio networking products.
History.
International Radio and Electronics Corporation (IREC) was established in 1947 by Clarence C. Moore, an Elkhart, Indiana minister. The company started out building rugged, open reel tape recorders for use by missionaries in far off parts of the world. A converted chicken coop served as the first manufacturing facility.
In the 1960s, the company's name was changed to "Crown International", as suggested by Moore's wife and co-founder, Ruby, as she felt the name "International Radio and Electronics Corporation" was too long, and because the emblem on many of their tape recorders was a crown. In 1975, the company's name was changed to Crown International, Inc., as voted by the stockholders.
A fire destroyed 60% of the Crown facility on Thanksgiving Day 1971 and rendered much of the remaining building severely damaged. US$1 million of uninsured assets were lost. The plant was rebuilt, and D-60 amplifier production was brought back on line within six weeks.
In March, 2000, Crown International was acquired by Harman International as their primary supplier of audio power amplifiers. The radio frequency broadcast division was subsequently repurchased by descendants of Clarence Moore who restructured the division in order to continue the manufacture of broadcast transmitters and RF amplifiers using Moore's original firm name: "International Radio & Electronics Corporation". Following Crown International's acquisition by Harman International, additional offices were set up in Northridge, Los Angeles, California, where AKG Acoustics, another Harman International company, maintains its North American headquarters.
Product timeline.
In 1947, Clarence and Ruby Moore began by modifying existing makes and models of tape recorders to make them more rugged. In 1949, Moore obtained a groundbreaking patent, the first tape recorder with a built-in power amplifier for public address duties, which was introduced in 1950. In 1953, Crown added a line of compact loudspeakers as accessories to the reel to reel tape recorders.
In 1959, Crown began making standalone tube power amplifiers. By 1963, solid state electronics development allowed Crown to produce a more robust tape recorder, and in 1964, their first solid state power amplifier: the low-profile SA 20-20. In 1967, the DC300 was introduced as the first AB+B circuitry amplifier with 150 watts per channel at eight ohms. The DC300 proved very popular with sound reinforcement system owners and moved Crown into a leadership position in terms of power amplifier sales worldwide. As well, the DC300 was seen as a breakthrough product by commercial sound system contractors seeking to power their constant voltage speaker systems without the frequency response limitations and power losses associated with output power transformers which had previously been required. In November 2007, after 40 years of service, the Crown DC300 was inducted into the TEC Awards TECnology Hall of Fame in New York on the opening day of the Audio Engineering Society's 123rd convention. George Peterson, executive editor of Mix magazine, said of the DC300 that it "was a classic that really ushered in and defined the era of the modern power amplifier."
In 1971, the grounded bridge amplifier design was invented by Crown, allowing greater output power without increasing amplifier size and also gave lower distortion, less thermal stress and greater reliability. The first grounded bridge product released by Crown was the M600 amplifier (1974) primarily employed for commercial sound installations including constant voltage loudspeaker systems. Crown received a patent for the invention in 1974. After proving itself in the field, the topology was used to design the Microtech MT-1000 in 1984. Further development of the grounded bridge yielded the Macrotech line which set a new standard for touring sound reinforcement in 1992 with the MA-5000VZ.
In 1976, Crown patented the synergistic equalizer, releasing the stereo EQ-2 graphic equalizer which used a combination of shelving-style tone controls and eleven active frequency adjustment faders per channel. The faders were connected to constant bandwidth, variable Q, 1/2-octave filters placed on octave centers but with adjustable frequency knobs to shift the center frequency for greater flexibility. A limited number of units were sold to audiophiles and audio researchers.
By 1977, all of Crown's tape recorder products had been phased out.
In 1979, Crown introduced the PSA-2 & SA-2 power amplifiers with analog computer control of transistor performance to maximize output characteristics. The FM-1 stereo radio tuner was praised at the Consumer Electronics Show. In 1981, the FM-2 with digital tuning was released.
A line of Pressure zone microphones (PZM) was introduced by Crown in 1980, culminating in the PZM-30 series in 1990. Other microphones introduced by Crown included the PCC-166 directional boundary microphone in 1986, the tiny GLM series and the patented differoid CM300 in 1987. The SASS stereo microphone was patented in 1989. Garth Brooks was the first performer to wear the Crown CM311 headset microphone in 1993. The CM700 studio condenser was introduced in 1995.

Tonlé Sap Biosphere Reserve

The Tonlé Sap Biosphere Reserve is a unique ecological phenomenon surrounding the Tonlé Sap or Great Lake of Cambodia. In 1997, it was successfully nominated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
Tonlé Sap.
The lake is linked to the Mekong River by the Tonlé Sap River. From November until June the lake flows into the Mekong. However, each year during the rainy season (mid June-late October) the Mekong River is inundated with rain waters. Its lower delta becomes flooded and cannot flow into the sea quickly enough to eliminate all the excess water. This causes the Mekong River to rise enough to reverse the flow of the Tonlé Sap River causing it to flow back into the lake. The lake expands from 2500 km2 to more than 16,000 km2 creating an enormous wetland area. This wetland area supports a tremendous amount of biodiversity including plants, reptiles, mammals, birds and other animals. Many of these are known to be rare or endangered. These wetlands are also an important breeding area for fish from the lake and Mekong River. Both Siamese crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis) and saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) once occurred side-by-side in the lake, and there is thought to be inter-species breeding amongst the crocodiles found in the floating farms on the western part of the Lake in and around Prek Toal.
Biosphere Reserve.
In 2001, the Tonlé Sap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) of Cambodia was established by Royal Decree of the government of Cambodia to fulfil 3 key functions. These are:
a) a conservation function to contribute to the conservation of biological diversity, landscapes, and ecosystem, including genetic resources, plant, fishery and animal species, and to the restoration of the essential character of the environment and habitat of biodiversity;
b) a development function to foster sustainable development of ecology, environment, economy, society, and culture;
c) a logistic function to provide support for demonstration projects, environmental education and training, research and monitoring of environment related to the local, national and global issues of conservation and sustainable development.
The Biosphere has been divided into 3 core areas for protection. These are; Prek Toal in Battambang Province, Boeng Tonle Chhmar in Kampong Thom Province and Stoeng Sen also in Kompong Thom. Boeng Tonle Chhmar has been selected as a Ramsar Convention site, which designates wetlands of international importance. The core areas function similar to national park areas and cover 42,300 ha. including the Great Lake.
Some people still live in these areas and are allowed to fish in them according to fishery law in Cambodia. Illegal fishing and poaching are major problems which threaten the fish population. Cutting of the flooded forest to make room for farming is also a serious issue. Many of the people who live around the lake are extremely poor and depend on it for their livelihoods. It is a challenge for sustainable development and conservation to coexist. It is also of vital importance. During the recent past the number of large fish caught has declined and the poor people who live around the lake are having an even more difficult time providing for themselves and their families. This creates a vicious cycle of increasing poverty, and in turn increasing threats and danger to the lake. This is also why 2 of the functions of the Royal Decree support education and support for the people living around the lake.
TSBR Secretariat.
A TSBR Secretariat was established to further the goal of protecting the biosphere and implement and support the functions of the Royal Decree. Since 2003 the Cambodian Government has supported the TSBR Secretariat with funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The major goal of the Secretariat is to develop a coordinated management strategy. Coordinated management is important because different stakeholders have various objectives. For example, farmers build channels to irrigate their fields. However, this leaves less water in fishing areas. Or farmers use pesticides on their crops which can get into the water; then people who live on the lake use this same water for bathing and other household uses and can become sick. This creates conflicts between user groups. The TSBR Secretariat attempts to lower these conflicts and find a solution that provides sustainability for all user groups and protects the biosphere reserve at the same time. The Secretariat is also responsible for developing and maintaining a web based knowledge repository for information about the lake and the biosphere. This website contains over 10,000 textual documents, over 150 tables and over 200 maps all relevant to the biosphere.

José María Rojas Garrido

José María Rojas Garrido (June 7, 1824 – July 18, 1883) was a Colombian Senator, and statesmen, who as the first Presidential Designate became Acting President of the United States of Colombia (now the Republic of Colombia) in 1866 during the absence of President elect Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera. He was a prominent journalist for several Liberal Party newspapers, and is considered one of the most important orators in Colombia's history.
Political career.
José María Rojas Garrido had a wide and extensive political career, serving at the Local, Departmental and National levels, and in the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the National Government.
Early political career.
Rojas Garrido received his Doctorate in Jurisprudence in 1847 from the "Colegio de San Bartolomé". In 1851 he was appointed Governor of the Province on Neiva by his close friend President José Hilario López. In 1856 he was elected to the Chamber of Representatives for the State of Antioquia, and shortly after was appointed Chargé d'affaires in Venezuela by President José María Obando. Rojas Garrido had a very close relationship with General Mosquera, they were close friends, and Rojas Garrido was appointed four times to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs four times, during the various administrations of Mosquera. In 1861 he served as Governor of the Province of Bogotá, and in 1862 served as Deputy in the Antioquia State Assembly, and from 1862 to 1863 he regained the office of Secretary of Foreign Affairs, having this time also control of the Ministry of War and Navy. In 1864 he returned to Venezuela this time as Minister Plenipotentiary and Special Commissioner. When he returned return to New Granada he was elected by Congress to the Supreme Court of Colombia.
Presidency 1865.
In 1866, former President General Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera was elected once again to the Presidency. On February 17, 1866, Congress held elections for the Presidential Delegates for that calendar year and elected José María Rojas Garrido First Presidential Designate, and Santos Acosta, and Marcelino Gutierrez as the Second and Third Presidential Designates. The Presidential Delegates were those who because of the abolishment of the office of Vice President were in line to succeed the President in his absence. The title did not carry an official office, but because General Mosquera was in Europe at the time, Rojas Garrido assumed the office of the Presidency on April 1, 1866, acting in the absence of the President Elect as the 3rd President of the United States of Colombia, until May 22, 1866 when General Mosquera returned to the country and was sworn in.
Post presidency.
After ceding power, José María Rojas Garrido remained an active advisor to the President being appointed one last time as Secretary of Foreign Affairs. He was later re-elected as Magistrate to the Supreme Court in 1870, and in 1872, Rojas Garrido ran an unsuccessful bid for the Presidency, losing the election to Manuel Murillo Toro. José María Rojas Garrido remained in the Supreme Court until his death on July 18, 1883 in Bogotá because of a pulmonary congestion.

North Melbourne Locomotive Depot

North Melbourne Locomotive Depot was the main location for maintenance of the Victorian Railways steam locomotive fleet based in Melbourne. Located in the middle of the Melbourne Yard precinct in the suburb West Melbourne near North Melbourne railway station, the site is now occupied by the Melbourne Steel Terminal. The depot was described by railway employees as ""the hub of the universe"", ""the VR's nearest approach to Dante's Inferno"", or ""the Black Hole of Calcutta"" depending on their disposition.
History.
The depot was opened sometime in the 1880s by the Victorian Railways, replacing their first locomotive depot located in the Spencer Street Station yard. It was located beside the Railway Canal, a section of Moonee Ponds Creek that enabled the direct unloading of coal transported by sea from New South Wales. The rectangular building was built of brick and iron with three turntables located inside. There were six track entrances, two at the front from the main goods yard, three from the stabling roads, and one at the rear. A three road coal stage was located to the south of the depot, along with a number of open air stabling roads.
As late as the 1950s the depot housed 160 locomotives, but with dieselisation from 1952 the end was near. The new South Dynon Locomotive Depot was opened across the creek for the new locomotives as part of the North East standard gauge project, with the last steam-hauled train leaving Melbourne on May 18, 1964 - R703 on the 6.05 pm to Geelong. The depot was ceremoniously demolished on January 20, 1965 when steam locomotive K188 pulled down the front wall of the depot with a steel rope in front of a crowd of onlookers.

Devazepide

Devazepide (L-364,718, MK-329) is a drug which is structurally derived from the benzodiazepine family, but with quite different actions from most benzodiazepines, lacking affinity for GABAA receptors and instead acting as a cholecystokinin antagonist selective for the CCKA subtype. It increases appetite and accelerates gastric emptying, and has been suggested as a potential treatment for a variety of gastrointestinal problems including dyspepsia, gastroparesis and gastric reflux. It is also widely used in scientific research into the CCKA receptor.

Yiftahel

Yiftahel is an archaeological site located in the Lower Galilee in northern Israel. Various salvage excavations took place here between 1992 and 2008. The best known periods of occupation are the Early Bronze Age I and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B.
In the Early Bronze Age village ca. 20 oval and rounded structures were uncovered. This is regarded as the most typical village of its period in the southern Levant.
The Pre-Pottery Neolithic B village is characterized by rectangular architecture and plastered floors of burnt limestone. One of the most important processes underway during the Neolithic period was the shift from a hunter-gatherer economy to early agriculture. The finds from Yiftahel shed light on the domestication of both animals and plants. Yiftahel produced over 1,000,000 lentils, an enormous quantity, clearly indicating controlled cultivation. The most important agricultural finding here, however, is the earliest appearance of domesticated horsebean seeds.

1999 Pentecost flood

The 1999 Pentecost flood () was a 100-year flood around the Pentecost season in 1999 that mostly affected Bavaria, Vorarlberg and Tirol. It was caused by heavy rainfall coinciding with the regular Alpine meltwater.
By late May, the annual spring meltwater from the Alps meant many Bavarian rivers were already at a high water level. On May 22 the rainstorm "Quartus" hit the northern Alps, bringing an additional 180 litres/m², causing the Ammersee and the Amper and Isar rivers to expand and flood large areas. These flooded areas expanded quickly covering parts of the Oberallgäu on the river Iller. The flood then continued downstream to some of the more inhabited areas in Bavaria.
The water level of the Isar, which flows through Munich, was lowered by the Sylvensteinspeicher reservoir near Bad Tölz. However causeways on the Iller failed, flooding Sonthofen, parts of Augsburg and Neustadt. In Hindelang-Hinterstein the flood reached a peak not recorded in the previous 250 years.
A subsequent Alpine highwater on 23-24 August 2005 again did damage to these areas.
In the Vorarlberg area the Rhine flood affected Lake Constance damaging Hard and Bregenz.
In Tirol the village Pflach in Lechtal was flooded.

Lands of Schlawe and Stolp

The Lands of Schlawe and Stolp (, ) are a historical region in Pomerania, centered around the towns of Sławno ("Schlawe") and Słupsk ("Stolp") in Farther Pomerania. The area is of some historic significance, as it initially did not belong to the Duchy of Pomerania (Slavinia) under Duke Wartislaw I and his descendants, who became vassals of the Holy Roman Emperor in 1181.
Geography.
The region comprises the easternmost part of Farther Pomerania, located between the Unieść river at the Góra Chełmska hill (about east of Koszalin) in the west, the historic border with the Bishopric of Cammin, and the Łeba River in the east, where it bordered on the lands of Pomerelia. In the north the region is bounded by the Baltic coast. Before 1945 the region had boundaries in the south to both the New March region of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg and to Greater Poland.
History.
Since the 1120s, the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp were ruled by Duke Ratibor I, the brother of Duke Wartislaw I of Pomerania. When Wartislaw was murdered about 1135, Ratibor also assumed the rule over his late brother's duchy as regent for his minor nephews, however upon his own death in 1156, the domains were again separated: Schlawe-Stolp was inherited by Ratibor's sons Swietopelk and Bogislaw, the so-called "Ratiborides" cadet branch of the Griffin House of Pomerania, while their cousin Duke Bogislaw I of Pomerania pledged allegiance to Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1181. Nevertheless all Pomerania was under Danish occupation from the 1180s to 1227.
Samborides.
The last member of the Ratiborides branch of the Griffins, Ratibor II, died in 1223. This led to an inheritance dispute between the Pomeranian Griffins and the Samborides dukes of neighbouring Pomerelia, vassals of the Piast Kingdom of Poland. As Ratibor II had died during the Danish period, Denmark administered the area until she had to withdraw after the lost Battle of Bornhöved in 1227. Duke Barnim I of Pomerania immediately took control of the lands after the Danish withdrawal, but had to yield rights to the Pomerelian duke Swietopelk II, who claimed a closer relationship to the extinct Ratiborides, and took over Schlawe-Stolp in 1235/36. 
In the 1250s, the Griffins mounted an unsuccessful campaign to gain the area. After the death of Duke Swantopolk II in 1266, Duke Barnim I of Pomerania again assumed the rule over the area and kept it until 1269, when Rugian prince Wizlaw II took over. On 3 September 1273 the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp became a fief under the Imperial Margraves of Brandenburg. Contested by late Swantopelks's son Duke Mestwin II of Pomerelia, Wizlaw II of Rugia finally withdrew in 1277 and sold his rights to the area for 3.500 Brandenburgian Marks in silver to the Margraves of Brandenburg. In 1283, Mestwin II of Pomerelia finally took over. Competition arose anew after his death in 1294, since the Samborides dynasty had become extinct and in his testimony Mestwin II had ignored his earlier contracts and by the secret Treaty of Kępno had inserted as his successor the former Polish High Duke Przemysł II of Greater Poland.
Inheritance conflict.
Przemysł II was crowned King of Poland in 1295 and assumed the rule over the Pomerelian lands with Schlawe-Stolp. However, after he was murdered the next year, the lands of Schlawe, Stolp and Rügenwalde fell to the Brandenburgian House of Ascania: A last attempt had been made by Przemysł II to occupy the region, but in 1296 the Polish invasion troops were beaten by a Pomeranian contingent in a decisive battle near Buckow, a village in the vicinity of the town of Rügenwalde. According to a chronic of 1652 by M. Merian, the lands were then taken over by Wizlaw of Rügen and count Adolph from Holstein. In 1301 Prince Sambor of Rugia enfeoffed his castellan Matthew in Schlawe with his domains in the surroundings of Schlawe, Rügenwalde and Stolp. The Pomeranian dukes, acting under the sovereignty of Brandenburg, were forced out and had to withdraw at about 1301, after the Bohemian king Wenceslaus II had become king of both Poland and Bohemia. He inserted a Polish administrator in the lands of Schlawe and Stolp, Frederic of Čachovice, a Czech noble, who appeared in Schlawe in December 1302.
After both King Wenceslaus II and his young successor, Wenceslaus III, had died, the Margraves of Brandenburg returned in 1305 to the lands of Schlawe, Rügenwalde and Stolp. In 1307 they launched from the region a campaign against the fortified castle of Gdańsk in Pomerelia. The attack failed, however, since the local warlord, Wŀadisŀaw Ŀokietek, had recruited soldiers of the Teutonic Knights in order to help defending it. 
In 1308, after a massacre of Gdańsk citizens, the city was taken over by Teutonic Order (Teutonic takeover of Danzig). Grand Master Siegfried von Feuchtwangen and Master Heinrich von Dirschau und Schwetz integrated Danzig into the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. In the Treaty of Soldin of 13 September 1309, the Ascanian Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg sold his claims to Pomerelia east of the Łeba River including Lauenburg and Bütow Land to the Teutonic Order, but retained Schlawe-Stolp. Emperor Henry VI ratified the Soldin Treaty in 1313, whereafter the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp finally were incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire.
Duchy of Pomerania.
The districts of Schlawe (now Sławno), Rügenwalde (Darłowo) and Stolp (Słupsk), remained with the Margraviate of Brandenburg and were ruled by the margraves' vassals, the Swienca family, who had administered the area already before under other dynasties. In 1316/17, the Griffin duke of Pomerania-Wolgast took over these areas as a fief from Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg. In 1347, the area became fully attached to the Duchy of Pomerania-Wolgast. The lands of Stolp were pawned to the Teutonic Order from 1329 to 1341, the Bütow area was bought by the Order in 1329 and thus remained outside Pomerania-Wolgast.
The lands of Schlawe and Stolp became part of the Duchy of Pomerania-Stolp after the partition of the Pomeranian duchy in 1368. The eastern border of the lands of Schlawe and Stolp to Pomerelia had shifted several times, before they, together with the lands of Lauenburg and Bütow, were integrated into the Prussian Province of Pomerania in 1653.

2009 Brisbane International

The 2009 Brisbane International was a professional tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts in Brisbane, Queensland. It was the first edition of the event known as the Brisbane International and resulted from the merger of the "Next Generation Adelaide International" on the men's tour with the "Mondial Australian Women's Hardcourts" on the women's tour. The 2009 Brisbane International was a World Tour 250 series event on the ATP Tour and an International series event on the WTA Tour. Both the men's and women's events took place at the Queensland Tennis Centre in Tennyson from 4 January through 11 January 2009.
The men's draw was led by Novak Djokovic, who was the World No. 3 ranked player, 2008 Australian Open champion, 2008 Pacific Life Open champion, and 2008 Tennis Masters Cup winner. Joining Djokovic in the tournament was Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who was the 2008 Australian Open runner-up and the 2008 champion of the tournament in Bangkok and the Masters Series tournament in Paris.

List of Knight's Cross recipients 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS

20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) (German:"20.Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS (estnische Nr.1)"), (Estonian:"20. Eesti relvagrenaderide SS-diviis") was formed in Spring 1944 after general conscription-mobilization was announced in Estonia on 31 January 1944 by the German occupying authorities. 38 000 men were conscripted and other Estonian units that had fought on various fronts on the German side were rushed to Estonia.
Estonian officers and men in other units that fell under the conscription proclamation and had returned to Estonia had their rank prefix changed from "SS" to "Waffen" (Hauptscharführer would be referred to as a Waffen-Hauptscharführer rather than SS-Hauptscharführer). The wearing of SS runes on the collar was forbidden, and these formations began wearing a national insignia instead.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573" of September 1, 1939 instituted the Iron Cross and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. As the war progressed some of the recipients distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849" of June 3, 1940. In 1941 two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613" of September 28, 1941 introduced the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the last and final grade, the Knight's Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11" of December 29, 1944 concluded the variants of the Knight's Cross.
Prerequisites.
To qualify for the Knight's Cross, a soldier had to already hold the 1939 Iron Cross First Class, though the Iron Cross I Class was awarded concurrently with the Knight's Cross in rare cases.
Unit commanders could also be awarded the medal for exemplary conduct by the unit as a whole.
Grades.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was divided into five grades, excluding the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross:

The Old 76 House

The Old '76 House (the '76 House) was a Dutch-style house built during the founding of Tappan, New York in 1686. In 1755 the building was expanded by the Mabie family to include additional space for a tavern. The earliest recorded Tappan town meetings were held in the '76 House and it remains the oldest example of public Dutch architecture in America. Tappan's earliest town records were kept at the tavern. These documents describe meetings of the town elders and provide details of the food and ale they consumed.
History.
Prior to 1755, the '76 House was known as "Mabie's Inn" and was home to Yoast Mabie. In 1755, Casparus Mabie, a cousin of the Loyalist Maybees, renovated the '76 House and it became known as a meeting place for patriots. The "Orangetown Resolutions" were adopted within the '76 House on July 4, 1774, exactly two years prior to the adoption of the "Declaration of Independence".
The '76 House was often used during the American Revolutionary War. Through its long history of use as a meeting place for patriots, the '76 House established itself as safe ground for Americans in the midst of the revolution. The '76 House also served as the "prison" of the Revolution's most notorious spy, Major John André.
Orangetown Resolutions.
The Dutch town elders of Tappan did not support the English and declared their support for American independence in a document deemed the "Orangetown Resolutions". This document was drafted and signed in the front dining room of the '76 House tavern. The production of the "Orangetown Resolutions" was so significant to Tappan that the'76 House has been preserved exactly as it was on July 4, 1774, when the document was publicly declared.
Revolutionary headquarters.
As the war continued, Fort Lee and New York were British strongholds in the Hudson Valley. The chain and forts at West Point were revolutionary strongholds, and the town of Tappan became the front line in the war of independence. The '76 House was a significant meeting point for patriot soldiers. George Washington and his first corp of the continental army utilized the '76 House during the periods of time they spent in Tappan. In 1780, British spy major, John André, was detained at the '76 House.
John Andre.
The British spy major, John André, was captured north of Tarrytown with a detailed plan of how to capture West Point. The plans were developed by an American general, Benedict Arnold, who was paid a large sum of money to covertly aid the British. Before being executed as a spy, John André was questioned by George Washington during his imprisonment in the '76 tavern. 
The execution of Major Andre, an adjutant general in the British army, significantly undermined the social structure of the colonies (previously it was rare for aristocrats to be executed).
The '76 House has often been referred to as "André's Prison"; however, the house has never officially been used as a place of incarceration.
Independence.
Washington met with Carlson in Tappan, at the '76 House, to receive plans of the British evacuation. The British withdrawal on April 19, 1783, was a significant event in the process of transforming America into an independent nation.
Colonial tavern.
In 1800, the '76 House began to operate exclusively as a tavern, and began to offer accommodation. Over the past two hundred years, the '76 House has accommodated every General of the west wing of the Continental Army, including Commander-in-Chief General George Washington.
The '76 House is one of America's oldest taverns, and is the only colonial tavern to have continually provided services in the same unaltered structure for the past 325 years. The building is located on 110 Main St, Tappan, New York. In 1987 Rob Norden purchased and restored the restaurant which is now owned and operated by his son. 
The '76 House is a contributing property to the Tappan Historic District.
In popular culture.
Several scenes from "College", the fifth episode of the The Sopranos first season, were shot at The Old 76 House. The scene is intended to portray a location in rural Maine.

Alessandro Polonini

Alessandro Polonini (1844, Crema – 1920, Crema) was an Italian bass-baritone. He created the roles of Benoît and Alcindoro in Puccini's opera, "La bohème", as well as Geronte de Ravoir in his "Manon Lescaut". Polonini also created the role of the surgeon in Verdi's "La forza del destino". 
Career.
During his career Polonini sang throughout Italy, and also appeared in Barcelona (Gran Teatre del Liceu), Saint Petersburg (Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre), Buenos Aires (Teatro Colón) and Montevideo (Teatro Solis). In 1881, he sang at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome in the theatre's first performances of Rossini's "The Barber of Seville" (Figaro), Bellini's "La sonnambula" (Count Rodolfo), and Verdi's "La forza del destino" (Fra Melitone). He returned there in 1894 for the Costanzi's first performance of "Manon Lescaut" (Geronte). Polonini appeared frequently at the Teatro Regio di Torino. In addition to his performances there in the world premieres of "Manon Lescaut" (1893) and "La bohème" (1896), he sang in the world premieres of two now forgotten Italian operas – Antonio Cagnoni's "Francesca da Rimimi" (1878) and Gaetano Luporini's "I dispetti amorosi" (1894). Polonini was also Beckmesser in the Teatro Regio's first performance of Wagner's "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" (1893).
Entimio Polonini.
Alessandro Polonini's father, Entimio Polonini (born circa 1820), was also an opera singer (bass) who sang in Italy, Paris, St. Petersburg and London. In Italy, Entimio Polonini sang in the premieres of Saverio Mercadante's "Il bravo, ossia La veneziana", (La Scala, 1839) and Otto Nicolai's "Il templario" (Teatro Regio di Torino, 1840). He made his London debut in 1847 and for 21 years sang with the Royal Italian Opera. In April 1855 he appeared there in Beethoven's "Fidelio" in the presence of Queen Victoria and Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, as part of the French emperor's state visit to Britain. Entimio Polonini also performed in other cities in Britain and Ireland with impresario Thomas Willert Beale's touring opera company.

Harsco Infrastructure Deutschland GmbH

The Harsco Infrastructure Deutschland GmbH ("formerly Hünnebeck GmbH"), with its headquarters located in Ratingen, Germany, is a subsidiary of the Harsco Corporation. The company develops, rents and sells formwork and scaffolding products for the main construction trade and civil engineering projects. Aside from that, Harsco Infrastructure offers an extensive range of services for the planning and development of projects, on top of logistics. The majority of the small- and medium-size enterprises which are its customers, come from the construction trade as well as the building industry, whereas the revenues in the scaffolding segment are mainly composed of sales to non-industrial clients.
History.
Emil Mauritz Hünnebeck founded the Rautennetz GmbH in 1929 in Essen, which dedicated itself to the construction and further development of the “lozenge net” technique. Then in 1937, the company relocated its main offices to Düsseldorf. In the years that followed, large construction projects such as shipyards and airplane hangars were built inside and outside of the country utilizing patented methods.
In 1956, the Deutsche Stahllamelle Hünnebeck GmbH in Lintorf erected a plant with 16 halls, several administration buildings as well as a stockyard for the production of steel-tube props and telescopic ceiling beams on its 155,000 sqm large premises with private railway siding. The company was later renamed to Hünnebeck GmbH in 1961. The sales outside of Germany were made through contracts with exclusive importers. At the beginning of the 1960s, the first foreign subsidiaries were founded, such as the Skandinavisk Hünnebeck A/S in Denmark, followed by subsidiaries in Austria in 1968 and Sweden in 1970.
Hünnebeck was taken over by the Thyssen AG in 1988 and thus merged with the since 1953 affiliated service organization RöRo. As a result of Germany’s reunification, the company expanded into the new federal states with 12 further branch offices. In 1995, the first steps were made in the U.S. and a 50% share of Safway Services Inc., in Milwaukee was acquired. Nowadays the company is represented in more than 30 countries. In Europe, the near and Middle-East, Africa and South America, Hünnebeck sells its products and services through 15 established subsidiaries, whereas the other countries are supplied through licensed distributors and dealers.
On the 31st of August, 2003, the American investment company Sun Capital acquired most shares of Hünnebeck GmbH and its 9 European subsidiaries at that time. As of November 2005, Hünnebeck officially became part of the Access Services division of the American Harsco Corporation, situated in Harrisburg/Pennsylvania.
At the end of 2009, the three tradition-rich companies, Hünnebeck, SGB and Patent, joined forces to operate under the common name Harsco Infrastructure. This gave birth to one of the biggest global suppliers of formwork, scaffolding and powered access equipment as well as industrial services with sales of approximately 1.11 billion US-dollars (2011).
Prominent Projects.
• Burj Khalifa, United Arab Emirates – Hünnebeck formwork technology was used in the construction of the highest and safest skyscraper of the 21st century.
• Golden Terrace, Poland – Hünnebeck equipment employed in the building of one Europe’s biggest shopping centers.
• Berlin Central Station, Germany – For the construction of the new main rail station, Hünnebeck supplied the formwork solution for both office towers.
• Hipogeno de Andacollo, Chile – Hünnebeck was part of one of the largest expansion projects for mines in South America.
• Power Plant Boxberg, Germany – Great amounts of formwork and scaffolding equipment as well as an intensive technical supervision were Hünnebeck’s main contributions to this large-scale project.

A station, in the context of New Zealand agriculture, is a large farm dedicated to the grazing of sheep and cattle. The use of the word for the farm or farm buildings date back to the mid-nineteenth century. The owner of a station is called a runholder.
Some of the stations in the South Island have been subject to the voluntary tenure review process. As part of this process the government has been buying out all or part of the leases. Poplars Station in the Lewis Pass area was purchased in part by the government in 2003. The Nature Heritage Fund was used to purchase 4000 ha for $1.89 million.

Williamstown Workshops

The Williamstown Workshops was the first railway workshop operated by the Victorian Railways, located in the Melbourne inner western suburb of Williamstown.
History.
The workshops opened in 1858 in four or five temporary buildings at Point Gellibrand, for the assembly of engines and carriages imported from England for the first government owned railways in the state. Other buildings were soon added, with seven locomotives built there, the first being number 100, a 2-4-0 passenger engine completed in 1872. As early as 1860 plans were made for new workshops but nothing came of these, until the 1880s when railway management described the workshops as inadequate and moves were made for new workshops at Newport. By 1889 the new shops were open, and Williamstown was closed.

ABC HD (Australia)

ABC HD was a national public television channel in Australia. It was available nationally to digital terrestrial and cable television viewers in Australia.
Starting in 1 January 2002 the channel was a prime-time simulcast of ABC1 NSW, except that it had no watermark and was upconverted from standard definition to high definition 1080i. In 1 January 2005 it was changed to 576p to accommodate the launch of ABC2 and gradually expanded its operating hours. In 1 January 2008 ABC HD was enhanced to 720p to mark the start of native high-definition content, and an "ABC HD" logo was developed, appearing as an on-screen watermark.
For its entire existence, the channel spent most of its hours providing a high definition simulcast of ABC1 NSW. As a result viewers outside of New South Wales would see Sydney-based news bulletins and other localised content. The purpose of this as of 2008, was to provide high-definition versions of ABC1 shows when available (Prior to this, the broadcaster relied on regulation exemptions that allowed it to meet a high-definition quota using content upscaled from standard definition).
There have been exceptions to the ABC1 simulcast: During the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, ABC HD became a dedicated sports broadcaster, simulcasting the dedicated coverage on ABC2 for most of the day. The 2009 VFL Grand Final was shown exclusively live on ABC HD. For a time up until ABC HD branding ceased, ABC HD screened a "7:30 Select" national highlights package instead of the NSW version of Stateline.
On 10 June 2010, the ABC HD watermark was replaced with the ABC1 logo. From this time forward, the channel became an ABC1 NSW simulcast again.
ABC HD ceased being a simulcast of ABC1 from 6 July 2010 in Tasmania and the ACT; 7 July 2010 in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Northern Territory; and on 8 July 2010 in Victoria and New South Wales, all replaced by a looped pre-launch promotion for ABC News 24 on channel 24. This made ABC the second broadcaster in Australia to permanently discontinue the high definition simulcast of its main channel, following the removal of Ten HD to create Ten's former sports and now entertainment channel One in 2009.

<doc id="20252949" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20252949" title="Construction estimating software">
Construction estimating software

Construction Estimating Software is computer software designed for contractors to estimate construction costs for a specific project. An estimator will typically use estimating software to estimate their bid price for a project, which will ultimately become part of a resulting construction contract. Some architects, engineers, construction managers, and others may also use estimating software to prepare cost estimates for purposes other than bidding.
History.
Traditional methods.
Construction contractors usually prepare bids or tenders to compete for a contract award for a project. To prepare the bid, first a cost estimate is prepared to determine the costs and then establish the price(s). This involves reviewing the project's plans and specifications to produce a take off or quantity survey, which is a listing of all the materials and items of work required for a construction project by the construction documents. Together with prices for these components, the measured quantities are the basis for calculation of the direct cost. Indirect costs and profit are added to arrive at a total amount.
Spreadsheets.
Estimators used columnar sheets of paper to organize the take off and the estimate itself into rows of items and columns containing the description, quantity and the pricing components. Some of these were similar to accounting ledger paper. They became known as green sheets or spreadsheets.
With the advent of computers in business, estimators began using spreadsheet applications like VisiCalc, Lotus 1-2-3, and Microsoft Excel to duplicate the traditional tabular format, while automating redundant mathematical formulas.
Many construction cost estimators (over 55%) continue to rely primarily upon manual methods, hard copy documents, and/or electronic spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. While spreadsheets are relatively easy to master and provide a means to create and report a construction cost estimate and or cost models, their benefit comes largely from their ability to partially relieve estimators of mundane calculations. Accuracy, however, is not necessarily improved and productivity is not maximized. For example, data entry remains tedious and prone to error, formula errors are common, and collaboration and information sharing are limited.
Commercial estimating software.
As more and more estimators came to rely on spreadsheets, and the formulas within the spreadsheets became more complex, spreadsheet errors became more frequent. These were typically formula errors and cell-reference errors. A benefit in using commercial estimating software is the hard-coded formulas in these applications which were originally created to overcome these errors. Other benefits include the use of reference databases for costs and other data, predictable and professional looking reports, speed, accuracy, and process standardization. As these applications became more and more popular over the years, additional features, such as saving data for reuse and trade-specific calculations, have become available.
For example, programs that are designed for building construction, include libraries and program features for traditional builders. In sharp contrast, programs that are designed for civil construction, include libraries and program features for roadway, utility, and bridge builders. In some instances, applications are provided without included resource databases. This requires that the user develop their own resource library; including discipline-specific resources (as an example: for civil infrastructure, mining, mechanical and electrical).
Sophisticated, Cost estimating and Efficient Project Delivery Software systems are also available to integrate various construction delivery methods such as Integrated Project Delivery, Job Order Contracting, and others (IDIQ, JOC, SABER...) simultaneously and securely. These newer Cost estimating and Efficient Project Delivery Software systems, enable estimators and project managers to collaboratively work with multiple projects, multiple estimates, and multiple contracts. A 'short list' of additional capabilities includes the ability to work with multiple cost books/guides/UPBs, track project status, automatically compare estimates, easily copy/paste, clone, and reuse estimates, integrated sophisticated visual estimating and quantity take-off (QTO) tools, including pattern search, automatically link specifications to estimates ...
Owners, Contractors, and AEs are moving to advanced cost estimating and management systems, and many oversight groups such are beginning to require their use. The level of collaboration, transparency, and information re-use enabled by Cost Estimating and Efficient Project Delivery Software drives 15-25%+ reductions in procurement cycles, six to ten times faster estimating, reduce overall project times, as a significant reduction in change orders and the virtual elimination of contract related legal disputes.
Typical features.
Three functions prove to be the most critical when buying cost estimating software:

Christina was suffering from a very deep depression and apparently did not want to have her children split up after her own suicide. The children had different fathers.
At her June 1998 trial, Riggs contended she was not guilty by reason of insanity, but the Pulaski County jury convicted her. During the penalty phase, Riggs would not allow attorneys to put on a defense, saying she wanted a death sentence. She was executed with a potassium chloride injection, the same substance with which she attempted to kill her children.
Riggs was placed in the Arkansas Department of Correction system and held at the McPherson Unit, which included the female death row, until her execution. The Arkansas execution chamber is located at the Cummins Unit.
On Sunday April 30, 2000, Riggs was flown from McPherson to Cummins in preparation for her execution. She was executed at 9:28 pm Central Daylight Time on May 2, 2000. Riggs was the fifth woman executed in the United States since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. She was the first woman executed in Arkansas since 1845. Her statement before execution began: "No words can express just how sorry I am for taking the lives of my babies. No way I can make up for or take away the pain I have caused everyone who knew and loved them." Her last words were, "I love you, my babies."

St Ives Bay

St Ives Bay (, meaning "bay of the sand dunes") is a bay on the Atlantic coast of north-west Cornwall in the United Kingdom. It is in the form of a shallow crescent, some 4 miles or 6 km across, between St Ives in the west and Godrevy Head in the east. 
At the most southerly point of St Ives Bay, the River Hayle flows into the sea through sand dunes and across the beach. Behind the dunes, the river forms a broad tidal estuary which includes an area of salt marsh and a largely disused port (see article on the industrial history of Hayle). The estuary is a popular place for birdwatching and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds maintains a reserve there.
The eastern coast of the bay is a three-mile (5 km) unbroken sandy beach backed by a substantial system of coastal dunes known as The Towans which stretches from Porth Kidney Sands in the west to Godrevy Head in the east. This stretch of beach is popular for surfing, particularly in the Gwithian area. 
The western side of the bay is on higher ground and is more densely inhabited with substantial settlements at Lelant, Carbis Bay and St Ives. The western coast of the bay is rockier with several small beaches separated by headlands.
The Stones reef lies about one mile north-west of Godrevy Head and presents a hazard to navigation - the lighthouse on Godrevy Island warns mariners of the danger. Inshore hazards include the strong tidal stream around Godrevy Island and the tidal current at the mouth of the River Hayle.
Transport and access.
By rail: The Penzance to Plymouth Cornish Main Line railway passes south of the bay with stations at St Erth and Hayle and a branch, the St Ives Bay Line, runs from St Erth to St Ives. 
By road: The B3301 coast road runs from Godrevy to Hayle behind the dunes, with many points of access to the coast. The A30 trunk road passes south of Hayle. 
On foot: The South West Coast Path follows the coast around St Ives Bay although it makes a detour inland around the Hayle estuary.

August Spennemann

August Spennemann (c.1878-1945) was a German amateur ornithologist who lived in Java for 25 years (1915-1940). While he was there he compiled an account of his observations in the late 1920s of the Javan Lapwing, near Pamanukan in West Java province. The typescript of his notes was lost until 2000 when it turned up at the Zoological Museum in Amsterdam. Spennemann’s notes include descriptions of the hitherto unrecorded behaviour and calls of the poorly-known bird, which was last seen in 1940 and is now probably extinct.

Kralj

Kralj is a South Slavic surname and title. It literally means "king" and, according to Petar Skok, is derived from Charles the Great (Karolus) in the same sense as Tsar is to Caesar.
In Slovenia, it is the 14th most common surname: it is present throughout the country, but it is especially common in central and southern Slovenia. In Croatia, it is the 49th most common surname, also present throughout the country, but most numerous in central Croatia.
It is also present in Serbia, e.g. the well known actor Petar Kralj, a name which during the Communist rule in Serbia caused stir when read according to the Austrian-Hungarian bureaucratic manner—inherited throughout Central Europe—of listing surnames before personal names in schools, the army, hospitals etc. because it sounds like King Peter of Yugoslavia.

Pitchfork (hand gesture)

The pitchfork is a hand gesture used predominantly at Arizona State University and events in which the school's athletic teams, the Arizona State Sun Devils, are taking part. The Arizona State mascot is Sparky the Sun Devil, who carries a trident. The hand gesture is especially popular among Sun Devil fans at athletic events, such as football, in which cheering is a large part. The Houston Cougars use this hand symbol as well. The hand gesture is also popular among professional wrestling fans.
History.
On November 20, 1946, the mascot of Arizona State University was changed from the Bulldogs to the Sun Devils by the student council, after a November 8 vote of the student body for such a change. Two years later, a former Disney illustrator named Bert Anthony was the first to add an actual trident to the Sparky image. It is not known exactly how long afterwards the pitchfork hand gesture became popular, but there are references to the gesture being used as far back as the 1970s.
In other instances of popular culture.
Professional wrestler Matt Hardy uses the pitchfork as his own signature gesture, but he calls it the V1. 
In a well-publicized image which was taken in late 2008, many websites and blogs mistakenly reported that George W. Bush was making the sexually connotative "Shocker" hand gesture when in reality he was making the pitchfork sign due to the visiting Arizona State men's and women's track team.

<doc id="20253573" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20253573" title="LB&amp;SCR B2 class">
LB&amp;SCR B2 class

The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) B2 class was a class of small 4-4-0 steam locomotives intended for express passenger work on the LB&SCR London to Portsmouth line. They were designed by R. J. Billinton and built at Brighton works from 1895 to 1897. They proved to be reliable locomotives but barely adequate for the heaviest trains and acquired the nickname "Grasshoppers". As a result the B3 and B2X classes were later rebuilds of these locomotives with larger boilers.
History.
When R. J. Billinton took over as chief Mechanical Engineer of the LB&SCR in 1890, following the sudden death of William Stroudley, the London to Brighton trains were adequately served by Stroudley's "Gladstone Class" but the lighter Portsmouth expresses were beginning to struggle behind his G class singles. Billinton therefore designed a small 4-4-0, specifically for these services. However, during the course of 1892/3 the London to Brighton trains began to increase in weight, and the Board of Governors of the railway agreed to invest money in larger turntables and so Billinton was able to enlarge his design further to make them more generally useful.
Three locomotives appeared in 1895, with a further eight in 1896 and fourteen in 1897. They were named after famous politicians, bankers and railway engineers. The new design was clearly influenced by the locomotives of Samuel W. Johnson on the Midland Railway, for whom Billinton had previously worked, and were the first LB&SCR locomotives to have leading bogie wheels. It incorporated Billinton's C2 class boiler. They proved to be adequate for the lightly loaded Portsmouth express trains but barely so for heavier trains. They also tended to ride unevenly and consequently acquired the nickname of "Grasshoppers" by their crews.
B3 & B2X Classes.
As a result of the complaints about the use of the class on the Brighton line, Billinton fitted the last locomotive in the class No. 213 Bessemer, with a larger boiler, which thereafter became known as the "B3 class". This caused a slight improvement in performance but not one significant enough to alter the entire class at that time. However, once the original boilers were worn out, it became more of an economic proposition to do so. Thus between October 1907 and 1910 Billinton's successor Douglas Earle Marsh rebuilt the entire class (including 213 Bessemer) with the improved boiler used on his C3 class, thereby creating the "B2X class".
The rebuilt locomotives were a significant improvement in both looks and performance and were used on the heaviest expresses to Portsmouth and Hastings and semi-fast trains on the Brighton line.
Post-grouping.
All 25 locomotives were still in regular use in December 1922 at the grouping of the railways of southern England to form the Southern Railway. The class continued to find useful work on secondary passenger services between London and the south coast until 1929, when the impending electrification of the Brighton line began to make them redundant. They were thus all withdrawn between June 1929 and March 1933, and none have survived in preservation.

Guo Quan (; born 1968) is a Chinese human rights activist. He founded the China New Democracy Party. He is a State Owned Enterprise cadre, secretary of the Nanjing Economic Restructuring Commission and Nanjing People's Court cadre.
In 1996 he earned a master's degree from Nanjing University's Sociology Department. In 1999 he received a PhD in philosophy from Nanjing University. From 1999-2001 he was a post-doctorate researcher at Nanjing Normal University.
In 2001 he was retained as a professor and PhD candidate advisor at Nanjing Normal University. He is also a researcher in the Nanjing Massacre Research Center.
Legal actions against Yahoo and Google.
In early 2008, Guo Quan, a university professor who had been dismissed after having founded a democratic opposition party, announced plans to sue Yahoo!( Chief Executive Jerry Yang)and Google in the United States for having blocked his name from search results in China.
Both Plaintiff Zheng Cunzhu (Ch:郑存柱) and plaintiff Guo Quan alleged that Yahoo's business tactic had caused them personal and financial harm. Zheng Cunzhu claimed :"(he) lost his property in China when he did not return for fear of getting arrested for his pro-democracy activities" and Guo Quan claimed that " he lost business when his name and that of his garment company were blocked by the Yahoo search results."
List of claims against Yahoo:
in November(2007) Yahoo settled an out of court lawsuit filed by family members of two other dissidents serving 10-year sentences after Yahoo handed their account information over to the Chinese government. And "last week(Jan 2008) Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang sent U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice a letter asking the government to secure the release of dissidents jailed in China for their pro-democracy sentiments."
Police harassments and arrests.
Guo's very public open letters to President Hu Jintao demanding multi-party elections and the depoliticisation of the People's Liberation Army, was widely published in internet blogosphere as well as the tradition media. Since then the Chinese cyber-police had begun to black out his blogs.
Guo Quan's wife Li Jing told reporter that Guo had been detained many times before, for a few days at a time. Now it could be for longer. “The police told me to prepare myself psychologically,” she said.
On 6 Feb 2008 Guo Quan told Jane Macartney, of The Times "that he had now found that the Chinese Yahoo! site had also blocked his name and he planned to bring actions against both companies." Mr Guo said: “Since January 1 a lot of friends told me that websites with my name had been closed. They told me it's impossible to search for my information on Google and Yahoo!”
On 13 Nov 2008 cnews reported that Guo Quan, was arrested Thursday in the city of Nanjing. According to his wife, the police's charge was "subversion of state power" Chinese police routinely uses the charge of "subversion of state power" to imprison dissidents for years. On 17 Oct 2009, Reuters reported that he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He has been described as a political prisoner.

Pedubast II

Pedubast II was a Pharaoh of Egypt associated with the 22nd or more likely the 23rd Dynasty. Not mentioned in all King lists, he is mentioned as a possible son and successor to Shoshenq V by Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton in their 2004 book, "The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt." They date his reign at about 743-733 BC, between Shoshenq V and Osorkon IV.
Jürgen von Beckerath places Pedubast II within the reign of Piye and in the 23rd Dynasty and proposes a reign of about 736-731 BC for this Egyptian pharaoh. The exact length of Pedubast's II's reign is uncertain. Pedubast II may have been the son of Iuput II and the then serving nomarch in Athribis because the king list of Piye places next to Osorkon IV, a Pedubast who is called a Prince of Athribis. 
Pedubast's II's royal name or prenomen was "Sehetepibenre" and he is attested as a king at Tanis--or at least a local Delta ruler who controlled this city--by several stone blocks found there bearing his royal titulary. Kenneth Kitchen, however, prefers to date Pedubast II's kingship around the time of the Assyrian invasion under Ashurbanipal in the mid-660's BC. Such is the degree of uncertainty surrounding this king's timeline during Ancient Egypt's Third Intermediate Period.

New Paper Big Walk

The New Paper Big Walk is a mass-participation walking event held annually in Singapore. It holds the official Guinness World Record as world's largest walk when a record-breaking 77,500 participants joined on May 21, 2000 at the Singapore National Stadium to mark the 10th anniversary.
The 10 kilometer walk takes an estimated 3 hours to complete and usually starts from its traditional starting point, Singapore National Stadium at 6 o'clock in the morning.
History.
The event was founded by "The New Paper". The very first Big Walk took place on June 16, 1991, and only 4,500 walkers were expected. However, expectations were exceeded when more than 7,000 walkers showed up on the day of the walk. Since then, the event has become more popular and today boasts the participation of tens of thousands of people annually.
On its 10th anniversary, The New Paper Big Walk 2000 broke into the official Guinness World record as World’s Largest Walk. Having the Guinness certificate means that this popular Singaporean mass event has ranked among the largest world events, such as the Boston Marathon.
The event took a one year in 2007, amid news that its venue of choice, the National Stadium at Kallang & Madash, was going to be torn down to make way for a world-class integrated sports' hub.
Locations.
The Singapore National Stadium.
Regarded as the venue of choice by "The New Paper" for its crowd-friendly features, character and location, the Singapore National Stadium has long been an integral part to the event's success.
However, the impending news that the Singapore government had plans to tear down the National Stadium to make way for a new state-of-the-art integrated sports hub led to the organizers decision to take a one year hiatus as they went in search of an alternative venue for the event.
The 2008 edition of the event was relocated to Marina Bay area and was aptly renamed "The Big Walk on Water."
The Marina Barrage.
As part of "The New Paper"'s 20th-anniversary celebrations, The New Paper Big Walk relocated to Singapore's "coolest" and "hottest" spots.
Flagging off at Suntec City's Fountain of Wealth, the revised 5 kilometers walk take participants across the Marina Channel and other breathtaking views such as The Esplanade, the Singapore Flyer, and part of the race track of the Formula One Singtel Singapore Grand Prix, which was held on 28 September 2008, before ending at the newly completed Marina Barrage that is set to become the new jewel of Singapore, with Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands, due to be completed by 2009.
The Big Walk On Water.
The "Big Walk on Water" is the new event name for The New Paper Big Walk as it makes its transition from the crowd-friendly National Stadium to the waters of Marina Bay.
The event, which returned after a one year hiatus, also marked the 20th anniversary of its organizers—"The New Paper"—and allowed readers and participants a chance to "walk on water" by crossing the dam across the Marina Channel.
Participation.
The New Paper Big Walk has been attracting more and more locals, which explain the leap in numbers, an increase by approximately 11 times since its inaugural walk back in 1991.
Today, the event attracts a healthy participation rate that includes both registered and non-registered participants that add to the spectacle of the event.
Programs and contests.
Other than the 5 km walk, there was a series of fun-filled programs and contests organized.
A post walk carnival at Suntec City Mall was held, where three contests like Spot Me, Green Fancy Dress and Stabilo Colouring awarded Fairprice shopping vouchers.
Significance.
The Big Walk On Water 2008 was organized to mark three significant events that happened that year.
First, the event was held as part of the celebrations for the success of the inaugural Formula One Singtel Singapore Grand Prix race—F1's first ever night race—held on 28 September 2008, by moving participants onto part of the race track where the drivers drove on race day.
Second, the event was also to mark the opening of the new Marina Barrage that officially opened on November 1st, 2008. Participants of the Big Walk On Water will most likely be the first few people to be allowed to visit the magnificent new Barrage and reservoir at Marina Bay.
The Big Walk On Water was organized to mark the 20th anniversary of "The New Paper". The change of name and its new location highlight and signify the "New Paper's" evolution to become one of Singapore's best selling newspapers today.
The New Paper Big Walk@Marina Bay 2010.
After skipping a year, the New Paper Big Walk returned in 2010. It was held on July 18, 2010, in conjunction with the significant openings of many new developments in Singapore. The 5 km route will allow the walkers to take in sights such as the Marina Bay skyline, the Singapore Flyer and the Helix Bridge, at a leisurely pace. Some 20,000 participants were expected to put their best foot forward for The New Paper Big Walk @ Marina Bay 2010. The Big Walk was co-organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), with sponsors NTUC FairPrice, Singapore Flyer, POSBank, Anlene, Nikon Singapore and Asus Singapore.

Salon de thé François

Salon de thé François is a café in Kyoto, Japan, located at Nishikiyamachi-dōri-Shijō-kudaru; Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto. The building is one of Japan's Registered Tangible Cultural Properties.
History.
Salon de thé François was established in 1934 by Shōichi Tateno (September 7, 1908 – June 6, 1995). The building was originally built as a traditional wooden townhouse (Machiya) and was later converted into a western-style café.
Tateno had graduated from Kyoto Municipal Art School and became one of the most active leaders of the labor movement in Kyoto in the 1930s. He decided to found a café with the spirit of enlightenment of socialism and art. The café was named “Salon de thé François” in homage to the French painter Jean-François Millet. The profit of the Salon de thé François became a secret source for funding the Japanese Communist Party.
On July 1936, the Salon de thé François started to support distribution of an anti-fascist newspaper, “Doyōbi.” The Doyōbi (“Saturday,” in Japanese) was a six-page tabloid edited by Masakazu Nakai, a lecturer at Kyoto Imperial University, and Raitarō Saitō, an actor at the Shochiku movie studio. The Doyōbi was issued twice a month, distributed mainly in Kyoto and Osaka, and reached a circulation of 8,000.
In July 1937, a week after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Tateno was arrested because of his anti-war activities. In November 1937, Nakai and Saito were also arrested and the Doyōbi was discontinued. During their imprisonment, Rushiko Sato, one of the hall staff members, operated the Salon de thé François.
After his release from Yamashina Prison, Tateno decided to remodel the Salon de thé François. Tateno asked an Italian friend, Alexsandro Bencivenni, to design a new interior. Bencivenni was an academic at Kyoto Imperial University who had escaped from fascist Italy. In these days, Fosco Maraini, an Italian ethnologist, also resided at Kyoto Imperial University for the same reason. While Bencivenni worked on the master plan, Shirō Takagi, another friend of Tateno, designed stained glass windows and painted several murals. The interior hall of 40 square meters was arched with a dome 4.5 meters high, which emulated a public room of an ocean liner sailing between Europe and Asia. The decorative motif represented the Italian Baroque style of the 17th century although several columns were designed to represent the style of the Italian Renaissance.
The Salon de thé François continued business even after the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, although the name was changed to Japanese “Miyako Sabō” (Kyoto Tea Room) because of the prohibition of the use of enemy languages. When Italy signed the armistice with the allies on September 1943, the Japanese authorities demanded Bencivenni declare allegiance to the fascist puppet republic of Salo. Bencivenni refused to do this and consequently was interned with Fosco Maraini and other Italians in a concentration camp at Nagoya for two years.
The Salon de thé François could no longer purchase coffee beans, and thus served green tea and dried banana chips as snacks. Tateno closed the shop in late 1944 because of the shortage of food and increased air raids.
The Salon de thé François returned to business after the end of the war. In 2002, the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs certified the building as a Registered Tangible Cultural Property. The three children of Tateno now operates the shop.

New Oxford Formation

The New Oxford Formation is a mapped bedrock unit consisting primarily of sandstones, conglomerates, and shales.
The New Oxford Formation was first described in Adams County, Pennsylvania in 1929, and over the following decade was mapped in adjacent York County, Pennsylvania and Frederick County, Maryland. It was described as "red shale and sandstone with beds of micaceous sandstone, arkose, and conglomerate." The majority of this early mapping was done by G. W. Stose, A. I. Jonas, and Florence Bascom.
Depositional Environment.
The New Oxford Formation and other formations of the Newark Supergroup were deposited in the Gettysburg Basin, just one of many Triassic rift basins existing on the east coast of North and South America, which formed as plate tectonics pulled apart Pangaea into the continents we see today.
Stratigraphy.
The New Oxford Formation is overlain by the Gettysburg Formation in Frederick County, Maryland and in Adams, Cumberland, Lancaster, and York Counties in Pennsylvania. In all other areas to the northeast in Pennsylvania the New Oxford Formation is overlain by the Hammer Creek Formation.
The New Oxford Formation overlies precambrian and paleozoic rocks at the bottom of the Gettysburg Basin.

The Lollipop Generation

The Lollipop Generation is an underground experimental film by Canadian artist G.B. Jones. G.B. Jones' previous films include "The Troublemakers" and "The Yo-Yo Gang". It premiered as the Gala Feature presentation of the Images Festival in Toronto on April 3, 2008.
Plot.
"The Lollipop Generation" tells the story of 'Georgie', a runaway teenager played by Jena von Brücker, and the people she meets on the "...outlying streets with no name..." At the same time, the film serves a diaristic function, documenting the people the director has met and the cities she travelled to, capturing an entire generation of underground performers.
Production.
The film was made over a period of 15 years, "one Super-8 reel at a time", whenever the director could afford to buy another cartridge of film. In the end, the Toronto band Kids on TV organized a benefit so that G.B. Jones could finish it.
Reception.
It has been described by the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema as, "...a trip through epileptic shots of documentary ugliness that go right to the origins and essence of sexually anarchic cinema...". However, Peter Keough of "The Boston Phoenix" insists, "There's a fine line between the trash of early John Waters and just plain garbage. G.B. Jones, perhaps to her credit, ignores it completely."
. Using Canadian pop culture reference points, Toronto's "Eye Weekly" calls it, "Scrappy as hell, yet often charming, it's a lost "Degrassi High" episode remade as an amateur porn flick and sometimes as sweet as all that candy." The 23rd Annual London L & G Film Festival catalogue says, "Shot on Super 8 and video, "The Lollipop Generation" harnesses these tools of the traditional home movie and uses them to make a fucked up family film."

Jacques Marcus Prevost

Jacques Marc, Jacques-Marc, James Marcus or Mark Prevost (1736, Geneva – 1781) was a British Army officer of Swiss origin.
Early life.
He was born in Switzerland to a family originating in Savoy and had eight siblings, including Jacques' two elder brothers Augustine (born 1723) and Jacques (born 1725), who both served in the army of the King of Sardinia then the Dutch Republic.
Seven Years War.
Jacques appears to have joined these two brothers in the Netherlands. Augustine was then commissioned as a major, Jacques as a colonel and Jacques Marcus as a captain in the new Royal American Regiment, formed of German and Swiss settlers in the colonies by Great Britain after General Braddock's defeat in western Pennsylvania in the French and Indian Wars in 1755 and with the threat of war with France looming. The three were sent to North America when this war broke out and Jacques Marc was wounded at the Battle of Carillon in New York in 1758. Augustine was also seriously wounded (with General James Wolfe's army near Quebec) that year, and the two brothers recuperated in New York City that year, with Augustine going on to serve further with the Royal American Regiment, especially in the Caribbean, rising to lieutenant colonel. In New York Jacques Marc first met Theodosia Stillwell Bartow.
When his wounds had healed, in 1761 Jacques Marcus went with Henry Bouquet, a Swiss colonel in the Royal American Regiment, to set up a British post at Presque Isle (present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) and show a presence at Fort Niagara. Next Prevost was assigned to command a body of troops in New York City but was soon put on half pay after the French defeat and the reduction in military activity. Whilst there he married Theodosia in Trinity Church in Manhattan in 1763. His next assignment was to command a detachment of Bouquet's force at Fort Loudoun on the Pennsylvania frontier fighting against Ohio Native American towns in the Muskingum Valley before returning to his wife in New York in 1765. He then went back onto half pay before his unit was posted to the West Indies in 1772, though he again returned to New York from 1773. By then the couple were living in The Hermitage.
American War of Independence.
On the outbreak of the American War of Independence he was a lieutenant-colonel living in Paramus, New Jersey, and after Savannah's capture in December 1778 he was for a short time British governor of Georgia in succession to Archibald Campbell. Accompanying a body of troops to Jamaica in 1781, he died of wounds suffered earlier in the war later that year. 
Family.
He had five children with his wife, including Augustine James Frederick Prevost (1765-1842), and John Bartow Prevost (1766-1825). Weeks after his death his widow, Theodosia Bartow Prevost, became involved with Aaron Burr, later marrying him.

Nord NC.850

__NOTOC__
The Nord NC.850 (originally produced as the Aérocentre NC.850) was a light aircraft developed in France in the late 1940s for use by French aeroclubs but which also saw military use as an airborne observation post.
Development.
The NC.850 series was developed from the Aérocentre NC.840 in response to a competition sponsored by the French government under the auspices of the SALS movement to find a domestically-produced machine for club use. Aérocentre's entry was an ungainly high-wing, strut-braced monoplane with a fully enclosed cabin and fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. The fuselage construction was tubular, and the wings had a metal structure, the entire aircraft being skinned in fabric.
The competition was won by the SIPA S.90, but SALS nevertheless also ordered 100 examples of this, the runner-up design. These production examples, designated NC.853, differed from the prototypes in having twin tails, the fins mounted on the ends of the horizontal stabiliser. Only 27 of the order had been completed, however, when Aérocentre was liquidated and its assets bought by Nord. The new owners continued production, with their machines identified with designation NC.853S.
Military version.
In March 1951, Nord flew a heavily modified version of the design for use as an observation aircraft by the French Army. Known as the NC.856 Norvegie, this featured a more powerful engine and lengthened and more extensively-glazed cockpit. The army ordered 112 examples which were mostly flown in the artillery spotting role, and while a civil version was also offered, orders were not forthcoming and only two were built. The sole example of a floatplane version was presented as a gift to King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia.

Jesus nahm zu sich die Zwölfe, BWV 22

The work, which is in five movements, begins with a scene from the Gospel reading in which Jesus foretells his suffering in Jerusalem. The unknown poet of the cantata text took the scene as a starting point for a sequence of aria, recitative and aria, in which the contemporary Christian takes the place of the disciples, who do not understand what Jesus is telling them about the events soon to unfold, but follow him nevertheless. The closing chorale is a stanza from Elisabeth Cruciger's hymn "". The music is scored for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, oboe, strings and basso continuo.
Bach performed the cantata first on 7 February 1723, together with another audition piece, . Bach performed the two cantatas again for the same occasion a year later when he was in office.
History and words.
Bach composed the cantata in 1723 for the Sunday Estomihi or Quinquagesima, the last Sunday before Lent. It was part of his application for the position of Thomaskantor in Leipzig, director of music of the city's main churches, the Thomaskirche, the Nikolaikirche and the Paulinerkirche as the church of the University of Leipzig. In Leipzig, "tempus clausum" was observed during Lent, therefore Estomihi was the last Sunday with a cantata performance before a vespers service on Good Friday and Easter. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, "praise of love" (), and from the Gospel of Luke, healing the blind near Jericho (). The Gospel also contains the announcement by Jesus of his future suffering in Jerusalem, which the disciples do not understand. Bach had prepared a cantata for the audition in Köthen, , on the topic of the healing. The theme of ' is the other topic from the Gospel, the announcement of suffering and the disciples' lack of understanding. An unknown poet chose text from the Gospel for the first movement (specifically, verses 31 and 34), and wrote a sequence of aria, recitative and aria for the following movements. After quoting the Gospel, the text places the Christian in general in the situation of the disciples: he is pictured as wanting to follow Jesus even in suffering, although he does not comprehend. The poetry ends on a prayer for "denial of the flesh". The closing chorale is stanza 5 of Elisabeth Cruciger's "", intensifying the prayer. Its melody is based on one from Wolflein Lochamer's "Lochamer-Liederbuch", printed in Nürnberg around 1455. It first appears as a sacred tune in Johann Walter's ' printed in Wittenberg in 1524.
Bach first performed both audition cantatas on 7 February 1723, this cantata before the sermon, and "" after the sermon. The score and the parts are extant; the score bears the note "This is the Leipzig audition piece". The score shows that Bach composed BWV 23 already in Köthen, but BWV 22 largely in Leipzig. Musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes that the paper was manufactured in Leipzig, and students of the Thomasschule copied some of the parts. He points out the contrast between the two works: "BWV 22 incorporates dance rhythms, and is written with a modern elegance." Musicologist Julian Mincham interprets Bach's approach as "... a fair example of the range of music which is suitable for worship and from which others might learn", explaining the "sheer range of forms and musical expression in these two cantatas".
Bach assumed the position of on 30 May 1723, the first Sunday after Trinity, with the cantata . He performed BWV 22 again on 20 February 1724, without changes, and likely again in later years.
Scoring and structure.
The cantata is in five movements and is scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, oboe, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.
Music.
The first movement renders the Gospel scene. An "ever-ascending" ritornello "evokes the image of the road of suffering embodied by going up to Jerusalem". The tenor, as the Evangelist, begins the narration from the Gospel's verse 31, ' (Jesus gathered the twelve to Himself). The words of the announcement of the suffering in Jerusalem, ' (Behold, we go up to Jerusalem) are assigned to the bass as the ' (voice of Christ). He sings them to several repeats of the ritornello. After another repeat of the ritornello, a choral fugue illustrates the reaction of the disciples, following verse 34 from the Gospel, ' (However they understood nothing). The voices are first accompanied only by the continuo, then doubled by instruments. Bach distinguishes in the autograph score "concertists" for the first section and "ripienists" when the instruments come in. The movement is concluded by an instrumental postlude. Mincham notes that the fugue deviates from the "traditional alternating of tonic and dominant entries ... as a rather abstruse indication of the lack of clarity and expectation amongst the disciples, Bach is hinting at this in musical terms by having each voice enter on a different note, B-flat, F, C and G and briefly touching upon various related keys. The music is, as always, lucid and focussed but the departure from traditional fugal procedure sends a fleeting message to those who appreciate the subtleties of the musical processes".
John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir and wrote a diary on the project, comments on the disciples' reaction ("and they understood none of these things, neither knew they the things which were spoken"): "One could read into this an ironic prophecy of the way Bach's new Leipzig audience would react to his creative outpourings over the next twenty-six years – in the absence, that is, of any tangible or proven signs of appreciation: neither wild enthusiasm, deep understanding nor overt dissatisfaction".
In the first aria, "" (My Jesus, draw me after You), the alto voice is accompanied by an obbligato oboe, which intensifies the text expressively.
The recitative "" (My Jesus, draw me, then I will run) is accompanied by the strings and leans towards an arioso, especially near the end.
The second aria, ' (My all in all, my eternal good), again with the strings, is a dance-like movement in free da capo form. In the modified repeat of the first section, the voice holds a long note on the word ' (peace), after which the same theme appears in the orchestra and again in the continuo. Isoyama notes the passepied character of the music, reminiscent of secular Köthen cantatas. Mincham describes: "Bach's expression of the joy of union with Christ can often seem quite worldly and uninhibited".
In the closing chorale, "" (Kill us through your goodness), a four-part setting of the voices is enriched by continuous runs of the oboe and violin I. Isoyama thinks that Bach may have intentionally imitated the style of his predecessor Johann Kuhnau in the "elegantly flowing obbligato for oboe and first violin". Gardiner describes the movement's bass line as a "walking bass as a symbol of the disciples' journey to fulfilment. Mincham comments: It would seem that Bach had not yet reached a conclusion, if indeed he ever did, as to the most appropriate way of utilising the chorales in his cantatas. Certainly the quiet, closing moments of reflection and introspection became the norm, particularly in the second cycle. But the chorale could, as here, act as a focus of bounding energy and positivity. Harriet Cohen made a noted piano arrangement of this chorale.

Harappan language

The Harappan language ( the Indus or Mohenjo-Daro language) is the unknown language or languages of the Bronze Age (2nd millennium BCE) Harappan civilization (Indus Valley Civilization, or 'IVC').
The language being unattested in any readable contemporary source, hypotheses regarding its nature are reduced to purported loanwords and substratum influence, notably the substratum in Vedic Sanskrit and a few terms recorded in Sumerian cuneiform (such as "Meluhha"), in conjunction with analyses of the undeciphered Indus script.
There are a number of hypotheses as to the nature of this unknown language:
There is a handful of possible loanwords reflecting the language of the Indus Valley Civilization. Sumerian "Meluhha" may be derived from a native term for the Indus Valley Civilization, also reflected in Sanskrit "mleccha", and Witzel (2000) further suggests that Sumerian GIŠ"šimmar" (a type of tree) may be cognate to Rigvedic "śimbala" and "śalmali" (also names of trees).
The question has some political significance in Indian politics, the Dravidian and Indo-European hypotheses being embraced by Dravidian and Hindu nationalists, respectively (see Indigenous Aryans for details).

Eri Yoshida

Baseball career.
Yoshida was fourteen-years-old when she taught herself how to throw the knuckleball after watching Major League Baseball pitcher Tim Wakefield on television. She stands tall, and her pitches have been clocked at , while her knuckleball measures around 50 mph. As a high-school sophomore at Kawasaki-kita Senior High School in Kawasaki, she threw the pitch well enough to earn a place on the school's baseball team. Her success caused a sensation in the national media, who dubbed her the "Knuckle Princess". In 2008, she signed a contract to play for the Kobe 9 Cruise of Kansai Independent Baseball League. 
Yoshida made her professional baseball debut at the Osaka Dome in the opening game of the Kansai Independent Baseball League on March 26, 2009 in front of 11,592 fans. She faced two batters, walking the first and striking-out the second in a 5-0 win over the Osaka Gold Villicanes. She appeared in 11 games for the Kobe 9 Cruise and moved on after the season to focus on advancing up the pro ranks. She appeared in a one-inning battle against the top hitters of the Hiroshima Carp on November 24, 2009.
On December 15, 2009 the Arizona Winter League announced that they had reached an agreement to allow Yoshida to play in their thirty-five game season. The league served to showcase players who had been overlooked by major league teams in the draft by giving them a chance to play in front of professional scouts. On February 12, 2010, Yoshida got her first win in Arizona Winter League play, throwing four shut-out innings in a 5-0 win for her team, the Yuma Scorpions, versus Team Canada of the Arizona Winter League.
On February 28, 2010, she was offered a contract to play in the Golden Baseball League, the major independent minor league in western North America, by the Chico Outlaws. The Outlaws were managed by former major league all-star Garry Templeton and the team president and general manager is former Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mike Marshall. On March 2, 2010, she trained with Tim Wakefield at the Boston Red Sox minor league training facility.
On April 8, 2010, she signed the contract with the Chico Outlaws and became the first female professional baseball player in the U.S. since the retirement of Ila Borders 10 years previously, and the first ever to play professionally in two countries. Her debut playing for the Chico Outlaws was on 29 May 2010. On Tuesday July 27, 2010, Yoshida made her first road start against the Victoria Seals of the independent Golden League in Victoria, British Columbia, making her the first woman in baseball history to pitch professionally in three different countries.
Yoshida was honored with a spot on Venus Zine's “25 under 25” list of remarkable women for 2009. On August 21, 2010, she was the feature story on FOX Sports' "This Week In Baseball", where she was shown meeting her idol, Boston Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield.
Yoshida ended the 2010 season with an 0-4 record, but earned praise for her work ethic from teammates and her manager, Garry Templeton. Templeton noted that any 18-year-old would struggle in the Golden Baseball League.
Yoshida played in the Arizona Winter League, an instructional league, in February 2011 but chose to start the 2011 season with an amateur team from Japan that would be playing in southern California. She signed a contract with the Chico Outlaws of the professional North American Baseball League in July and pitched a no-decision as her team beat the Edmonton Capitals. She was traded later that week to Maui, rejoining her manager from last year, Garry Templeton, and started on August 9 as she pitched 5-innings of one-hit ball and picked up her first professional win in the U.S. as Maui defeated Edmonton 4-1.
In 2012 she returned to Japan to play for the Hyogo Blue Sandars of the Kansai Independent Baseball League. On May 3, 2012, Yoshida made her first start of the year for the Hyogo Blue Thunders. She hurled five innings, giving up just one run, walking 1 while striking out 2. She earned the win, making her the first woman to win a game in the Kansai Independent League.
In June 2012, Yoshida returned to pitch for Na Koa Ikaika Maui of the North American Baseball League. In her first start on June 9, 2012, she earned the win in a 10-2 Maui victory over the Hawaii Stars. She hurled 7 and 2/3 innings, giving up only four hits and two runs, as well as walking one batter and striking out another. Yoshida won her next two starts to begin the year with a 3-0 record, but then experienced problems controlling her pitches and lost five games in a row. She ended the season with a record of 4 wins and 6 losses with a 5.56 earned run average.

Radial axle

A radial axle is an axle on a railway locomotive or carriage which has been designed to move laterally when entering a curve in order to reduce the flange and rail wear. 
Radial axles were widely used on carriages in the late 19th century before the adoption of bogies. They were also used on the leading or trailing carrying axles of locomotives, particularly tank locomotives. The idea was first tried successfully by William Bridges Adams on the London and South Western Railway in 1863 and was known as the Adams Axle. It was subsequently taken up by other engineers, notably his namesake William Adams, Locomotive Superintendent of the LSWR, who introduced a class now known as "Adams Radials".
Radial axles were also used in locomotives designed by F.W. Webb of the London and North Western Railway, and by William Stroudley and R. J. Billinton of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway.

List of Gaylactic Spectrum Award winners and nominees for best short fiction

The Gaylactic Spectrum Awards are given to works of science fiction, fantasy and horror that explore LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender) topics in a positive way. They were founded in 1998, first presented by the Gaylactic Network in 1999, and in 2002 they were given their own organization, the "Gaylactic Spectrum Awards Foundation".
Awards are given in categories for novels, short fiction and best other work, although in some years the award for short fiction has not been presented due to lack of sufficient nominees or no nominee of high enough quality. Other categories have also been added and removed in intervening years, and works produced before the inception of the awards are eligible to be inducted into the "Hall of Fame". The short fiction category is open to submissions of short written works released during the prior calendar year in North America that includes "significant positive GLBT content". The long list of nominees is reduced to a short list of finalists, and the results are generally announced and presented at Gaylaxicon, a convention dedicated to LGBT science fiction, although they have also been presented at Worldcon in the past.
This article lists all the "Best short fiction" award nominees and winners, and short fiction hall of fame inductees.
Each award consists of an etched image on lucite on a stand, using a spiral galaxy in a triangle logo, which is based on the logo the Gaylactic Network. The award winner's name, work title, award year and award category are etched on a small plaque on the base or on the plexiglass itself. A small cash stipend is awarded to winners in the Best Short Fiction category. The cost of the awards is paid for through individual donations and fundraising events.
Steve Berman has the record for most nominations, having been a finalist four times without winning. No writer has won the short fiction award more than once.

Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America

Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America is the extraction and purification of metals, as well as creating metal alloys and fabrication with metal by Indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to European contact in the late 15th century. Indigenous Americans have been using native metals from ancient times, with recent finds of gold artifacts in the Andean region dated to 2155–1936 BCE. and North American copper finds dated to approximately 5000 BCE. The metal would have been found in nature without need for smelting techniques and shaped into the desired form using heat and cold hammering techniques without chemically altering it by alloying it. To date "no one has found evidence that points to the use of melting, smelting and casting in prehistoric eastern North America." In South America the case is quite different. Indigenous South Americans had full metallurgy with smelting and various metals being purposely alloyed. Metallurgy in Mesoamerica developed from contacts with South America .
South America.
South American metal working seems to have developed in the Andean region of modern Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina with gold and copper being hammered and shaped into intricate objects, particularly ornaments. Recent finds date the earliest gold work to 2155–1936 BCE. and the earliest copper work to 1432–1132 BCE. There were found in the context of a society undergoing social and economic changes but still very much a small food producer and not quite sedentary yet. This breaks away from the idea that this type of metal work developed in societies with enough food surplus to support an elite. Rather than being a product of a hierarchical society, gold might have been meshed in the creation of it. Further evidence for this type of metal work comes from the sites at Waywaka, Chavín and Kotosh, and it seems to have been spread throughout Andean societies by the Early horizon (1000–200 BCE).
Unlike in other metallurgy traditions where metals gain importance due to their widespread use in fields ranging from weaponry to everyday utensils, metals in South America (and later in Central America) were mainly valued as adornments and objects representative of a high status (though some more functional objects might have been produced). It is during the Early horizon that advancements in metal working result in spectacular and characteristically Andean gold objects made by the joining of smaller metal sheets, and also gold-silver alloy appears.
Two traditions seem to have developed alongside each other – one in northern Peru and Ecuador, and another in the Altiplano region of southern Peru, Bolivia and Chile. There is evidence for smelting of copper sulphide in the Altiplano region around the Early horizon. Evidence for this comes from copper slag recovered at several sites, with the ore itself possibly coming from the south Chilean-Bolivian border. Extensive use of "portable" smelting kilns in the vicinity of Puma Punku, Bolivia and at three additional sites in Peru and Bolivia to manufacture, in situ, "I" beams as connectors to large stone blocks during the construction process represent a seemingly anomalous function for metal smelting. The reported chemical analysis of these metal pours is 95.15% copper 2.05% arsenic, 1.70% nickel, .84% silicon and .26% iron. The estimated date of these pours is between 8000 BCE–500 CE.
Evidence for fully developed smelting however only appears with the Moche culture (northern coast, 200 BCE–600 CE) . The ores were being extracted at shallow deposits in the Andean foothills, whether by specialised workers or slaves/prisoners is unclear. In any case the ores are believed to have been smelted at nearby locations, evidenced in the actual metal artifacts and from ceramic vessels depicting the process, which is believed to have been occurring in adobe brick furnaces with at least three blow pipes to provide the air flow needed to reach the high temperatures. The resulting ingots would then have been moved to coastal centres where shaping of the object would occur in specialised workshops. Both of the workshops found and studied were located near administrative sections of the respective towns – again indicative of the high value placed upon metal.
The objects themselves were still mainly adornments, now often being attached to beads. Some functional objects were fashioned but they were elaborately decorated and often found within high status burial contexts. For this reason, it is believed that they were still being used more for symbolic purposes. The appearance of gold or silver seems to have been important, with a high number of gilded or silvered objects as well as the appearance of Tumbaga, a copper/gold and sometimes also silver alloy. Arsenic bronze was also being smelted from sulphidic ores, a practice either independently developed or learned from the southern tradition.
This technology gradually spread north into Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica, reaching Guatemala and Belize by 800 CE.
It is really only with the Incas that metals gain a more utilitarian use. Nonetheless, they remained materials through which to display wealth and status. The characteristic importance placed on colour, which had led to some of the earlier developments, was still present (Sun/Moon association with gold/silver). Metals other than gold also had an intrinsic value with the axe pieces being of particular note in this regard. With the spread of metal tools being carried out by the Incas, it is thought possible that a more Old World use of metals would have become more common. In any case, as Bruhns notes, "Bronze can be seen as an expensive substitute for the equally efficient stone".
Central America.
Gold, copper and tumbaga objects started being produced in Panama and Costa Rica between 300–500 CE. Open-molded casting with oxidation gilding and cast filigrees were in use. By 700–800 CE, small metal sculptures were common and an extensive range of gold and tumbago ornaments comprised the usual regalia of persons of high status in Panama and Costa Rica.
Mesoamerica.
Metallurgy only appears in Mesoamerica in 800 CE with the best evidence from west Mexico. Much like in South America, fine metals were seen as a material for the elite. Metal's special qualities of colour and resonance seemed to have appealed most and then led to the particular technological developments seen in the region.
Exchange of ideas and goods with peoples from the Ecuador and Colombia region (likely via a maritime route) seems to have fueled early interest and development. Similar metal artefact types are found in West Mexico and the two regions: copper rings, needles and tweezers being fabricated in the same ways as in Ecuador and also found in similar archaeological contexts. There is also a multitude of bells found, but in this case they were cast using the same lost-wax casting method as seen in Colombia. During this period, copper was being used almost exclusively.
Continual contact kept the flow of ideas from that same region and later, coinciding with the development of Andean long distance maritime trade, influence from further south seems to have reached the region and led to a second period (1200–1300 CE to the Spanish arrival). By this time, copper alloys were being explored by West Mexican metallurgists, partly because the different mechanical properties were needed to fashion specific artefacts, particularly axe-monies – further evidence for contact with the Andean region. However, in general the new properties such alloys introduced were developed to meet regional needs, especially wirework bells, which at times had such high tin content in the bronze that it was irrelevant for its mechanical properties but gave the bells a golden colour.
The actual artifacts and then techniques were imported from the south, but west Mexican metallurgists worked ores from the abundant local deposits; the metal was not being imported. Even when the technology spread from West into north-eastern, central and southern Mexico, artifacts that can be traced back to West Mexican ores are abundant, if not exclusive. It is not always clear if the metal reached its final destination as an ingot, an ore or a finished artifact. Provenance studies on metal artifacts from southern Mesoamerica cast with the lost-wax technique and dissimilar to west Mexican artefacts have shown that there might have been a second point of emergence of metallurgy into Mesoamerica there since no known source could be identified.
The Aztecs did not initially adopt metal working, even though they had acquired metal objects from other peoples. However, as conquest gained them metal working regions, the technology started to spread. By the time of the Spanish conquest, a bronze-smelting technology seemed to be nascent.
North America.
Archaeological evidence has not revealed metal smelting or alloying of metals by pre-Columbian indigenous peoples north of the Rio Grande; however, they did use native copper extensively.
As widely accepted as this statement might be it should not be considered synonymous with a lack of metal objects, as it points out native copper was abundant particularly in the Great Lakes region and "overlooks the simple fact that there was really very little to be gained by smelting..." The latest glacial period had resulted in the scouring of copper bearing rocks. Once the ice retreated, these were readily available for use in a variety of sizes. Copper was shaped via cold hammering into objects from very early dates (Archaic period in the Great Lakes region: 8000–1000 BCE). There is also evidence of actual mining of copper veins (Old Copper Complex), but disagreement exists as to the dates.
Unlike its Southern counterpart, North American metallurgy had a more utilitarian purpose from very early on, shifting away from primarily attaching prestige to the metal artifacts (knives, fishhooks, bracelets).
Extraction would have been extremely difficult. Hammerstones may have been used to break off pieces small enough to be worked. This labor intensive process might have been eased by building a fire on top of the deposit, then quickly dousing the hot rock with water, creating small cracks. This process could be repeated to create more small cracks.
The copper could then be cold-hammered into shape, which would make it brittle, or hammered and heated in an annealing process to avoid this. The final object would then have to be ground and sharpened using local sandstone. Numerous bars have also been found, possibly indicative of trade for which their shaping into a bar would also serve as proof of quality.
Great Lake artifacts found in the Eastern Woodlands of North America seem to indicate there were widespread trading networks by 1000 BCE. Progressively the usage of copper for tools decreases with more jewellery and adornments being found. This is believed to be indicative of social changes to a more hierarchical society.
However this Great Lake model as a unique source of copper and of copper technologies remaining somewhat static for over 6000 years has recently come into some level of criticism, particularly since other deposits seem to have been available to ancient North Americans, even if a lot smaller.
During the Mississippian period (800–1600 CE, varying locally), elites at major political and religious centers throughout the midwestern and southeastern United States used copper ornamentation as a sign of their status by crafting the sacred material into representations connected with the Chiefly Warrior cult of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (S.E.C.C.). This ornamentation includes Mississippian copper plates, repousséd plates of beaten copper now found as far afield as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. Some of the more famous of the plates are of raptorial birds and avian-themed dancing warriors. These plates, such as the Rogan plates from Etowah, the Spiro plates from the Spiro in Oklahoma, and the Wulfing cache from southeast Missouri, were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept known as the S.E.C.C.
The only Mississippian culture site where a copper workshop has been located by archaeologists is Cahokia in western Illinois. Excavations of the copper workshops at Mound 34 (a small mound located on the Ramey Plaza east of Monks Mound) indicate copper was worked there. Numerous copper fragments as well as ashes from fires were found in the area as well as the remains of three tree stumps thought to have been used to hold anvil stones used for beating out the flattened sheets of copper.
After the collapse of the Mississippian way of life in the 1500s, copper still retained a place in Native American religious life as a special material. Copper was traditionally regarded as sacred by many historic period Eastern tribes. Copper nuggets are included in medicine bundles among Great Lakes tribes. Among 19th century Muscogee Creeks, a group of copper plates carried along the Trail of Tears are regarded as some of the tribe's most sacred items.

Pakistanis in Japan

Migration history.
As early as 1950, only three years after the Partition of India which created the Pakistani state, there were recorded to be four Pakistanis living in Japan. However, Pakistani migration to Japan would not grow to a large scale until the 1980s. The later Pakistani migrants in Japan largely come from a "muhajir" background; their family history of migration made them consider working overseas as a "natural choice" when they found opportunities at home to be too limited. While Pakistanis saw North America as a good destination to settle down and start a business, Japanese employment agencies commonly advertised in Karachi newspapers in the 1980s, when Japan offered some of the highest wages in the world for unskilled labour; it came to be preferred as a destination by single male migrants, who came without their families. The wages they earned could reach as high as twenty times what they made in Pakistan. Another attraction of Japan over other traditional migration destinations, particularly the Middle East, was the social freedom it offered to migrants; some young Pakistanis came not so much out of economic motives, but instead out of a desire to find freedom which seemed unattainable at home or in other Muslim countries.
Pakistani citizens once enjoyed the privilege of short-term visa-free entry to Japan, but when controversy arose in Japanese society over illegal foreign workers, the Japanese government revoked this privilege. With little chance of acquiring a work visa or even permission to enter the country, Pakistanis paid as much as ¥300,000 to people smugglers in the late 1980s and early 1990s to enter the country. According to Japanese government statistics, the number of Pakistanis illegally residing in Japan peaked in 1992 at 8,056 individuals and declined after that. However, Pakistani sources suggest that as late as 1999, the total population of Pakistanis was 25,000 and still included a significant amount of illegal immigrants. Some Pakistanis were able to obtain legal resident status by finding Japanese spouses.
However, in the tightened security environment following the September 11 attacks in the United States, many were deported; the population shrunk to around 10,000 legal immigrants. In January 2010, two children born in Japan to a Pakistani father and a Filipina mother were ordered to be deported along with their parents because the latter lacked proper visas when they came to Japan 20 years earlier.
Demographics.
According to 2008 Japanese government figures, 19.9% of registered Pakistanis lived in Saitama, 17.8% in Tokyo, 12.3% in Kanagawa, 10.4% in Aichi, 8.98% in Chiba, 7.59% in Gunma, 6.02% in Ibaraki, 4.44% in Tochigi, 4.21% in Toyama, 3.27% in Shizuoka, and the remaining 4.98% in other prefectures of Japan. Only an estimated 200 Pakistanis hold Japanese citizenship.
Business and employment.
Many Pakistanis in Japan run used car export businesses. This trend was believed to have begun in the late 1970s, when one Pakistani working in Japan sent a car back to his homeland. The potential for doing business in used cars also attracted more Pakistanis to come to Japan in the 1990s.
Though many migrants come from a middle-class family background in Pakistan, because they often work at so-called Dirty, Dangerous and Demeaning (3D/3K) jobs, and because of their portrayal in the Japanese media, even their co-workers tended to misperceive their background and level of education.
Religion.
Many Japanese wives of Pakistani migrants have converted to Islam, and in fact form the largest group of native Japanese converts to Islam. They often send their children to mosques so that they can learn about their ancestral religion and study the Arabic language.
In 2001, an incident of Qur'an desecration in Toyama, where about 150 Pakistanis lived, sparked protests from the community. At least one Qur'an was taken from a makeshift prayer room used by Pakistanis, with allegations that six others had also been stolen; someone later left torn Qur'an pages at a Pakistani-owned used car dealership. Hundreds of Pakistani Muslims marched in Tokyo, and nine representatives from the Pakistani Association of Japan met with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to deliver a letter of protest.
Media.
Japan has some Urdu-language media aimed at Pakistanis, such as the freely distributed "Pak Shimbun", as well as other Japanese-language publications targeted towards Muslims at large.

Entfernet euch, ihr heitern Sterne, BWV Anh 9

Entfernet euch, ihr heitern Sterne (Disperse yourselves, ye stars, serenely!), BWV Anh 9, is a birthday cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He composed it in Leipzig to celebrate the 57th birthday of King Augustus II the Strong, and it was performed for him on his birthday, 12 May 1727, on the Marktplatz of Leipzig, by students of the University of Leipzig, with Bach directing. The king was also presented with the work's libretto, written by Christian Friedrich Haupt.
The music to this secular birthday cantata by Bach is lost. It has been speculated from the surviving libretto, however, that several movements from the "Mass in B minor" are derived from it, and a reconstruction has been created using the Mass in lieu of this.

Basil Maclear

Basil Maclear (1881–1915) was an Irish rugby international. He won eleven caps between 1905 and 1907. 
He was the grandson of Sir Thomas Maclear, Her Majesty's Astronomer in Cape Town, South Africa and son of Captain Henry Maclear, an Officer in The Buffs. He was later sent to Fermoy in County Cork by the British Army.
Like fellow international Ernest Deane, Maclear was killed in action during the First World War, serving as a captain with the Royal Dublin Fusiliers at the Second Battle of Ypres. His remains were not recovered and his name is recorded on the Menin Gate memorial nearby.
Career.
He won his first cap against England on 11 February 1905 in a game against Wales. He scored four tries and three conversions during his eleven international games for Ireland.
In the match against New Zealand on their 1905 tour, he was captain of Munster, who ended up losing 33-0.

Institute for Sales and Account Management

The Institute for Sales and Account Management (ISAM) is a Dutch knowledge institute that was founded in 1996 as part of the Erasmus University Rotterdam. ISAM conducts research in the field of neuroeconomics; a science in which economics, psychology, and neuroscience are combined.
Serving as an example is the research into the brain activity of salespeople, which can be detected through the use of fMRI scans. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a technique that can trace the location in the brains where someone is processing information at the moment that he or she is faced with a stimulus (e.g. interaction with a client). Thus, with the help of an fMRI scanner both the conscious as well as the unconscious brain processes can be traced. This study has been realized in cooperation with the Erasmus MC (medical center) and the University of Michigan. It has been published in the Journal of Marketing Research.
All knowledge that is acquired through ISAM research, is transferred to the (inter)national business world by means of postgraduate education programmes in the field of sales and account management.

Tukvnanawopi

Tûkvnanawöpi is a two-player abstract strategy board game played by the Hopi native American Indians of Arizona, USA. The game was traditionally played on a slab of stone, and the board pattern etched on it. Tukvnanawopi resembles draughts and Alquerque. Each player attempts to capture each other's pieces by hopping over them. It is unknown how old the game is, however, the game was published as early as 1907 in Stewart Culin's book "Games of the North American Indians Volume 2: Games of Skill".
A similar game (with a similar name) also played by the Hopi is Tuknanavuhpi. The only difference is that in Tuknanavuhpi lines of intersection points become unplayable as oppose to rows or columns of squares in Tukvnanawopi when the game progresses. Rule #7 under the Game Play and Rules section elaborates on this. Another similar game is played by the Keres native American tribe in New Mexico called Aiyawatstani. Lastly, the game is also similar to Kharbaga from Africa which may suggest a historical connection. 
Goal.
The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces wins.
Equipment.
A 5x5 square board is used. Left and right leaning diagonal lines run through each square. This accounts for 41 intersection points. Each player has 20 pieces called "pokmoita" which means animals. One set of 20 pieces may be black, and the other set of 20 pieces may be white. 
Game Play and Rules.
1. Players decide who will start first, and which among them will play the black and white pieces. 
2. Each player's 20 pieces are set up on their half of the board on the intersection points including the middle (5th.) rank specifically the two intersection points to the left of the middle point. The middle point is the only intersection point left vacant in the beginning.
3. Players alternate their turns. A player may only use one of their own pieces to either move or capture. 
4. On a player's turn, a piece may be moved in any direction along a line onto an adjacent intersection point that is vacant. In the beginning, the first player must bring a piece to the middle point as it is the only vacant intersection point.
5. Alternatively, a player may use a piece to capture an adjacent enemy piece by leaping over it, as in draughts and Alquerque, and landing on a vacant point immediately beyond. A player can leap an enemy piece from any direction. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. 
6. It is uncertain if captures are compulsory, and whether multiple leaps and captures are allowed since no source specifically mentions it.
7. When a row or column of squares on one end of the board becomes empty during the course of the game, pieces can no longer be played in that row or column of squares. It is uncertain, however, if the "points on the line between the rows or columns of squares" can be played upon when one of the rows or columns is empty and unplayable
8. As the game progresses, another row or column of squares on one end of the board will eventually become empty, and therefore unplayable. The playing area of the board continues to shrink during the course of the game.

Mining and metallurgy in medieval Europe

The Middle Ages in Europe cover the time span from the 5th century AD, marked by the decay of the Roman Empire, to the 16th century, when social and economic factors shifted Europe towards the Modern Era. During the millennium between classical antiquity and the modern period, a series of technological innovations and inventions, which led to the industrial era, took place. Such technological achievements affected directly the extraction of raw materials, such as metal ores and coal, and the growth of the metal output in terms of quantity, as well as quality.
Metal production in medieval Europe may have been affected, decreased or increased, by different factors, but it was never ceased, as different kinds of metal objects were always in demand either in periods of war (e.g. arms and armour) or peace (e.g. implements and tools, coinage, building construction, decoration, bells, ecclesiastical and status items, etc.). Metallurgical activities were also encouraged by central political power, regional authorities, monastic orders and ecclesiastical overlords, who always tried to have control and claimed Regalian rights over the mines and a share in the output, both in private lands and regions belonging to the Crown. They were particularly interested in the extraction of the precious metal ores, but not only, and for this reason the mines in their territories were open to all miners (Nef 1987, 706-715).
Early Middle Ages, 5th to 10th centuries.
The social, political, economic stagnation and decline that followed the decadence of the Roman World affected Europe, throughout the early medieval period, and had critical impact upon the technological progress, trade and social organization. Technological developments that affected the course of metal production were only feasible within a stable political environment, and this was not the case until the 9th century (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, a).
During the first medieval centuries, the output of metal was in a steady decline and constraint in small scale activities. Miners adopted methods much less efficient than those of the roman times. Ores were extracted only from shallow depths or from remnants of former abandoned mines, assuming that the old shafts weren't already sunk. The vicinity of the mine to villages or towns was also a determinant factor when deciding about working on site, because of the high cost of material transportation (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, b). It seems like only the output of iron diminished less in relation to the rest of the base and precious metals until the 8th century. This fact, correlated with the dramatic decrease in copper production, in particular, may indicate a possible displacement of copper and bronze artifacts from iron ones (Forbes 1957, 64; Bayley et al. 2008, 50).
By the end of the 9th century, economic and social conditions, which dictated the increased need of metal for agriculture, arms, stirrups, and decoration, started to favor metallurgy and a slow but steady general progress was noted. Smelting sites were multiplied and new mines were discovered and exploited, like the well-known Mines of Rammelsberg, close to the town of Goslar by the Harz Mountains. Open-cast mining and metallurgical activities were mostly concentrated in the Eastern Alps, Saxony, Bohemia, Tuscany, the Rhineland, Gaul and Spain (Nef 1987). French, Flemish, but mainly German miners and metallurgists were the generators of metal production.
High Middle Ages, 11th to 13th centuries.
The period right after the 10th century, mark the widespread application of several innovations in the field of mining strategies and ore treatment and, consequently, the shift to large scale and better quality production. Medieval miners and metallurgists had to find solutions for the practical problems that limited former metal production, in order to correspond sufficiently to the calls of those times. The increased demand for metal was an expression of the remarkable population growth from the 11th to the 13th centuries and its impact on agriculture, trade, building construction, including the great gothic churches.
The main concern had to do with inefficient means for draining water out of shafts and adits when operating underground mining, which resulted in flooding of mines and limited extraction activities only in depths close to the surface. Once ores extracted, more problems concerning the difficulty of their transportation and thus the high cost of undertaking such attempts, as well as the profitable separation of metals from gangue or secondary separation of metals, came up. The need for solutions to these problems was the power that generated the development of achievements with critical impact over medieval metal output. The use of water power and wheels for water-driven draining engines, bellows, hammers and the introduction of advanced types of furnaces were the craftsmen's response to this problem. However, the introduction of these innovations did not mean that they were adopted at once or applied to all mines and smelting sites. Throughout the medieval period technical innovations and traditional techniques coexisted and their application depended on the time period and geographical region. Water power in medieval mining and metallurgy was introduced even before the 11th century, but it was only until then that it was widely applied. In addition, the introduction of the blast furnace, mostly for iron smelting, and the furnace in all the established centres of metallurgy contributed to quantitative and qualitative improvement of the metal output, available in lower price. In addition, cupellation, already known from the 8th century, was more often applied for the refinement of lead-silver ores and the obtainment of the precious metal (Bayley 2008).
Underground work in shafts, although limited in certain depths, was accomplished either by fire-setting, for massive ore bodies, or with iron tools, for smaller scale extraction of limited veins. The sorting of base and precious metal ores was completed underground and they were transferred separately (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, b). Parallel production with more than one technical methods and different treatment of ores can be present in one site (Rehren et al. 1999).
The intensified progress and the unprecedented interest in metal production were also reflected in the multiplication of active mines and smelting sites (Nef 1987). In relation to sites of the early Middle Ages, these smelting sites need not be near the mines. The presence of streams and thick forests and the access to water for generating the wheels and to wood for fuel and building were more critical than ever. Rich silver-bearing ores of Freiberg in Saxony, discovered by accident in the 12th century, rivaled the Rammelsberg production. While until the 11th and 12th centuries, mining took place mainly in the Eastern Alps, during the following period it was also spread to regions of Central Europe. Base metals such as copper, lead, zinc, tin and iron, precious metals (silver and gold) and alloys, such as brass, bronze and pewter were produced in Central Europe. The most famous regions for their metal production are Bohemia, Silesia, Hungary, Upper Harz, the Black Forest, Styria, Saxony, England, France and Spain. While abundant wood resources were provided by the thick woodlands of the Carpathians, the Erzgebirge and the Sudeten Mountains.
Late Middle Ages, 14th to 16th centuries.
By the 14th century, the majority of the more easily accessible ore deposits were exhausted. Thus, more advanced technological achievements were introduced in order to cope up with the demand in metal. The alchemical laboratory, separating precious metals from the baser ones they are typically found with, was an essential feature of the metallurgical enterprise. However, a significant hiatus in underground mining was noted during the 14th and the early 15th century because of a series of historical events with severe social and economic impacts. The Great Famine (1315–1317), the Black Death (1347–1353), which diminished European population to 1/3, and the Hundred Years War (1337–1453), which amongst others caused severe deforestation, had also dramatic influences in metallurgical industry and trade. The great demand of material, e.g. for armour, could not be met due to the lack of manpower and capital investment.
It is only by the end of the 13th century that great capital expenditures are invested and more sophisticated machinery is installed in underground mining, which resulted in reaching great depths. The wider application of water- and horse-power was necessary for draining water out of these deep shafts. Also, acid parting in separating gold from silver was introduced in the 14th century (Bayley 2008). However, notable signs of recovery were present only after the mid-15th century, when the improved methods were widely adopted (Nef 1987, 723).
Determinant for the European metal production and trade was the discovery of the New World, which affected world economy ever since. Even though new rich ore deposits were found in Central Europe during the 15th century, this was not enough to meet the large amounts of precious metal imports from America.
Smiths and miners within medieval society.
Metallurgists throughout medieval Europe were free to move within different regions. German metallurgists in search of rich precious metal ores, for instance, took the leading part in mining and affected the course of metal production, not only in East and South Germany, but in almost all Central Europe and the Eastern Alps. As mining was gradually became a task for specialized craftsmen, miners moved in large groups and they formed settlements with their own customs close to mines. They were always welcome by the regional authorities, since the latter were interested in increasing the revenue and the exploitation of the mineral-rich subsurface was quite profitable. The authorities, lay and ecclesiastical, claimed a part of the output and smiths and miners were provided with land for cottages, mills, forges, farming and pasture and they were allowed to use streams and lumber (Nef 1987, 706-715).
Progressing to the high and late Middle Ages, as smelting sites became geographically independent from mines, metalworking was separated from ore smelting. The urban expansion from the 10th century onwards and the dominant role of towns provided metallurgists with the right environment to develop and improve their technology. Metallurgists got organized in guilds and, usually, their workshops were concentrated in town peripheries (McLees 1996).
In medieval societies liberal and mechanical arts were considered as totally different from each other. Metallurgists, as all craftsmen and artisans, lacked the methodical intellectual background but they were the pioneers of causal thinking, based on empirical observation and experimentation (Zilsel 2000).

The Clinic (game)

The Clinic is a psychological quiz game based on celebrity and popular culture, ideally for use as a party game. It was developed by Winning Moves UK in 2008.
The Clinic's gameplay is similar to psychological profile quizzes found in magazines, where players answer a series of multiple choice questions and eventually arrive at a set psychological profile at the end.
The game's name and theme comes from the UK media obsession with fame, celebrity, and the pressures of being in the spotlight, as illustrated by publications such as Heat (magazine), OK!, Hello!, the London Lite and thelondonpaper. It seeks to play on the notion that any normal person can be thrust into the limelight via reality and talent shows such as Big Brother or The X Factor.
How To Play.
The gameplay is designed to encourage discussion and banter over players' questions and answers, many of which are humorous and edgy in nature.
Play begins when one player draws a question card from the pile and asks that question of the player to their left, along with the four multiple choice answers. The player gives the answer that they feel best applies. The questioner then looks at the question card to see whether the player has given a Mad, Bad, Sad or Glad answer. The player who has answered then makes an answer on their clipboard in the appropriate section, Mad, Bad, Sad or Glad.
Play continues until all players have been asked the set amount of questions. At this point, players add up the marks on their clipboard in the four sections, which gives them a tally of Mad, Bad, Sad or Glad. For example, if a player has:
Mad: 10
Bad: 5
Sad: 4
Glad: 11
Then their profile will be Glad, Mad, Bad, Sad, or GMBS. Players then look up their profile in the Clinic Analysis Book, which gives them a full psychological profile, including which celebrities they are most like, which celebrity friends they might socialise with, what television shows they might appear on, and a final Clinic Rating which answers the game's opening question of "Are You Mad?"
Unprofessional Opinion cards.
Several of the question cards in The Clinic are Unprofessional Opinion cards. Instead of the player answering these questions, all the other players vote on which answer they think best applies to that player. This leads to further discussion, debate and banter as players try to agree on an answer, and also allows for subterfuge as players can influence the other players' final GBMS tally by voting for a specific answer.

Tuknanavuhpi

Tuknanavuhpi is a two-player abstract strategy board game played by the Hopi Native American Indians of Arizona, USA. It is also played in many parts of Mexico. The game was traditionally played on a slab of stone with the board pattern etched on it. Tukvnanawopi resembles draughts and Alquerque. Players attempt to capture each other's pieces by hopping over them. It is not known when the game was first played; however, the game was published as early as 1907 in Stewart Culin's book "Games of the North American Indians Volume 2: Games of Skill".
A similar game (with a similar name) also played by the Hopi is Tukvnanawopi. The only differences are that in Tuknanavuhpi lines of intersection points become unplayable as opposed to rows or columns of squares in Tukvnanawopi, and that in Tukvnanawopi there can be two or four players. (A more elaborate description is provided in the Game Play and Rules section.) Another similar game called Aiyawatstani is played by the Keres Native American tribe in New Mexico. Additionally, the game is also similar to Kharbaga from Africa, which may suggest a historical connection.
Objective.
The object of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces. The player who does so wins.
Equipment.
A 4×4 square board is used. Left and right leaning diagonal lines run through each square. This accounts for 41 intersection points. Each player has 20 pieces called "pokmoita", which means "animals". Each set of 20 pieces is discernible from the other, generally by color. The design of pieces varies, with common variants including grains of maize or black and white stones.

Syncope (medicine)

Syncope ( ), the medical term for fainting or passing out, is defined as a transient loss of consciousness and postural tone, characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous recovery, due to global cerebral hypoperfusion (low blood flow to the brain) that most often results from hypotension (low blood pressure). This definition of syncope differs from others by including the cause of unconsciousness, i.e. transient global cerebral hypoperfusion. Without that addition, the definition of syncope would include disorders such as epileptic seizures, concussion or cerebrovascular accident and syncope is distinguished from coma, which can include persistent states of unconsciousness. This confusion still occurs in some literature.
Many forms of syncope are preceded by a prodromal state that often includes dizziness and loss of vision ("blackout") (temporary), loss of hearing (temporary), loss of pain and feeling (temporary), nausea and abdominal discomfort, weakness, sweating, a feeling of heat, palpitations and other phenomena, which, if they do not progress to loss of consciousness and postural tone are often denoted "presyncope".
There are three broad categories of syncope, cardiogenic, reflex (i.e. neurally mediated) and orthostatic hypotension, which underlie most forms of syncope. Cardiogenic forms are more likely to produce serious morbidity or mortality and require prompt or even immediate treatment. Although cardiogenic syncope is much more common in older patients, an effort to rule out arrhythmic, obstructive, ischemic, or cardiomyopathic causes of syncope and circulatory inadequacy is mandatory in each patient.
Variants of reflex syncope often have characteristic histories, including precipitants and time course. These become evident through skilled history-taking. Thus, the clinical history is the foremost tool used in the differential diagnosis of syncope. Physical examination, and electrocardiogram are part of the initial evaluation of syncope and other more specific tools such as implantable loop recorders may be necessary in clinically uncertain cases.
Syncope is extraordinarily common, occurring for the most part in two age ranges: the teenage years, and during older age. Estimates of lifetime incidence of at least one syncopal episode include 40 to 50 percent of the general populace. Syncope comprises 1 to 3 percent of all attendances to emergency departments and 1 to 6 percent of all hospital admissions.
Etymology.
The term is derived from the Late Latin "syncope", from Ancient Greek συγκοπή ("sunkopē"), from σύν ("sin", "together, thoroughly") and κόπτειν ("koptein", "strike, cut off").
Differential diagnosis.
Central nervous system ischaemia.
The central ischaemic response is triggered by an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood in the brain.
The respiratory system may contribute to oxygen levels through hyperventilation, though a sudden ischaemic episode may also proceed faster than the respiratory system can respond. These processes cause the typical symptoms of fainting: pale skin, rapid breathing, nausea and weakness of the limbs, particularly of the legs. If the ischaemia is intense or prolonged, limb weakness progresses to collapse. An individual with very little skin pigmentation may appear to have all color drained from his or her face at the onset of an episode. This effect combined with the following collapse can make a strong and dramatic impression on bystanders.
The weakness of the legs causes most sufferers to sit or lie down if there is time to do so. This may avert a complete collapse, but whether the sufferer sits down or falls down, the result of an ischaemic episode is a posture in which less blood pressure is required to achieve adequate blood flow. It is unclear whether this is a mechanism evolved in response to the circulatory difficulties of human bipedalism or merely a serendipitous result of a pre-existing circulatory response .
Vertebro-basilar arterial disease.
Arterial disease in the upper spinal cord, or lower brain, causes syncope if there is a reduction in blood supply, which may occur with extending the neck or after drugs to lower blood pressure.
Vasovagal.
Vasovagal (situational) syncope, one of the most common types, may occur in scary, embarrassing or uneasy situations, or during blood drawing, coughing ("cough syncope"), urination ("micturition syncope") or defecation ("defecation syncope"). Vasovagal syncope can be considered in two forms:
A pattern of background factors contributes to the attacks. There is typically an unsuspected relatively low blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet in the absence of any salt-retaining tendency. Heat causes vaso-dilation and worsens the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. That sets the scene, but the next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, needle phobia), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable to meet requirement because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is always modulated by vagal outflow, in these cases leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response. The tilt-table test typically evokes the attack.
Much of this pathway was discovered in animal experiments by Bezold (Vienna) in the 1860s. In animals, it may represent a defence mechanism when confronted by danger ("playing possum"). This reflex occurs in only some people and may be similar to that described in other animals.
The mechanism described here suggests that a practical way to prevent attacks might seem counter-intuitive—specifically to block the adrenergic signal with a beta-blocker. A simpler plan might be to explain the mechanism, discuss causes of fear, and optimise salt as well as water intake.
Psychological factors also have been found to mediate syncope. It is important for general practitioners and the psychologist in their primary care team to work closely together, and to help patients identify how they might be avoiding activities of daily living due to anticipatory anxiety in relation to a possible faint and the feared physical damage it may cause. Fainting in response to a blood stimulus, needle or a dead body are common and patients can quickly develop safety behaviours to avoid any recurrences of a fainting response. See link for a good description of psychological interventions and theories.
An evolutionary psychology view is that some forms of fainting are non-verbal signals that developed in response to increased inter-group aggression during the paleolithic. A non-combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in blood-injection-injury type phobias such as trypanophobia as well as the gender differences.
Deglutition (Swallowing) syncope.
Syncope may occur during deglutition. Manisty et al. note: "Deglutition syncope is characterised by loss of consciousness on swallowing; it has been associated not only with ingestion of solid food, but also with carbonated and ice-cold beverages, and even belching."
Cardiac.
Cardiac arrhythmias.
Most common cause of cardiac syncope. Two major groups of arrhythmias are bradycardia and tachycardia.
Bradycardia can be caused by heart blocks. Tachycardias include SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) and VT (ventricular tachycardia). SVT does not cause syncope except in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Ventricular tachycardia originate in the ventricles. VT causes syncope and can result in sudden death. Ventricular tachycardia, which describes a heart rate of over 100 beats per minute with at least three irregular heartbeats as a sequence of consecutive premature beats, can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, which requires DC cardioversion.
Typically, tachycardic generated syncope is caused by a cessation of beats following a tachycardic episode. This condition, called tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, is usually caused by sinoatrial node dysfunction or block or atrioventricular block.
Obstructive cardiac lesion.
Aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis are the most common examples. Aortic stenosis presents with repeated episodes of syncope. A pulmonary embolism can cause obstructed blood vessels. High blood pressure in the arteries supplying the lungs (pulmonary artery hypertension) can occur during pulmonary embolism. Rarely, cardiac tumors such as atrial myxomas can also lead to syncope.
Structural cardiopulmonary disease.
These are relatively infrequent causes of faints. The most common cause in this category is fainting associated with an acute myocardial infarction or ischemic event. The faint in this case is primarily caused by an abnormal nervous system reaction similar to the reflex faints. In general, faints caused by structural disease of the heart or blood vessels are particularly important to recognize, as they are warning of potentially life-threatening conditions. Among other conditions prone to trigger syncope (by either hemodynamic compromise or by a neural reflex mechanism, or both), some of the most important are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, acute aortic dissection, pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, aortic stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension.
Other cardiac causes.
Sick sinus syndrome, a sinus node dysfunction, causing alternating bradycardia and tachycardia. Often there is a long pause asystole between heartbeat.
Adams-Stokes syndrome is a cardiac syncope that occurs with seizures caused by complete or incomplete heart block. Symptoms include deep and fast respiration, weak and slow pulse and respiratory pauses that may last for 60 seconds.
Aortic dissection (a tear in the aorta) and cardiomyopathy can also result in syncope.
Various medications, such as β-blockers, may cause bradycardia induced syncope.
Blood pressure.
"Orthostatic (postural) hypotensive faint"s are as common or perhaps even more common than vasovagal syncope. Orthostatic faints are most often associated with movement from lying or sitting to a standing position.
Apparently healthy individuals may experience minor symptoms ("lightheadedness", "greying-out") as they stand up if blood pressure is slow to respond to the stress of upright posture. If the blood pressure is not adequately maintained during standing, faints may develop. However, the resulting "transient orthostatic hypotension" does not necessarily signal any serious underlying disease.
The most susceptible individuals are elderly frail individuals, or persons who are dehydrated from hot environments or inadequate fluid intake. More serious orthostatic hypotension is often the result of certain commonly prescribed medications such as diuretics, β-adrenergic blockers, other anti-hypertensives (including vasodilators), and nitroglycerin. In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the autonomic nervous system due to systemic diseases (e.g., amyloidosis or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).
Other causes.
Factors that influence fainting are fasting long hours, taking in too little food and fluids, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, high g-force, emotional distress, and lack of sleep. Orthostatic hypotension caused by standing up too quickly or being in a very hot room can also cause fainting. The classic example of a combination of these is seen in the frequent fainting by medical students in the operating theatre during observation of surgery.
More serious causes of fainting include cardiac (heart-related) conditions such as an abnormal heart rhythm (an arrhythmia), wherein the heart beats too slowly, too rapidly, or too irregularly to pump enough blood to the brain. Some arrhythmias can be life-threatening. Other important cardio-vascular conditions that can be manifested by syncope include subclavian steal syndrome and aortic stenosis.
Fainting can also occur following the severe fits of coughing associated with pertussis or "whooping cough."
Diagnostic approach.
For people with uncomplicated syncope (without seizures and a normal neurological exam) computed tomography or MRI is not indicated. Likewise, using carotid ultrasonography on the premise of identifying carotid artery disease as a cause of syncope also is not indicated. Although sometimes investigated as a cause of syncope, carotid artery problems are unlikely to cause that condition.
A hemoglobin count may indicate anemia or blood loss. However, this has been useful in only about 5% of patients evaluated for fainting.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart. It is estimated that from 20%-50% of patients have an abnormal ECG. However, while an ECG may identify conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart block, or a new or old heart attack, it typically does not provide a definite diagnosis for the underlying cause for fainting.
Sometimes, a Holter monitor may be used. This is a portable ECG device that can record the wearer's heart rhythms during daily activities over an extended period of time. Since fainting usually does not occur upon command, a Holter monitor can provide a better understanding of the heart's activity during fainting episodes.
The Tilt table test is performed to elicit orthostatic syncope secondary to autonomic dysfunction (neurogenic).
For patients with more than two episodes of syncope and no diagnosis on “routine testing”, an insertable cardiac monitor might be used. It lasts 28–36 months. Smaller than a pack of gum, it is inserted just beneath the skin in the upper chest area. The procedure typically takes 15 to 20 minutes. Once inserted, the device continuously monitors the rate and rhythm of the heart. Upon waking from a “fainting” spell, the patient places a hand held pager size device called an Activator over the implanted device and simply presses a button. This information is stored and retrieved by their physician and some devices can be monitored remotely.
San Francisco syncope rule.
The San Francisco syncope rule was developed to isolate people who have higher risk for a serious cause of syncope. High risk is anyone who has: congestive heart failure, hematocrit <30%, electrocardiograph abnormality, shortness of breath, or systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg. The San Francisco syncope rule however was not validated by subsequent studies.
Management.
Recommended acute treatment of vasovagal and orthostatic (hypotension) syncope involves returning blood to the brain by positioning the person on the ground, with legs slightly elevated or leaning forward and the head between the knees for at least 10–15 minutes, preferably in a cool and quiet place. For individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting. At the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell. After the symptoms have passed, sleep is recommended. If fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease. In case syncope is caused by cardiac disease, the treatment is much more sophisticated than that of vasovagal syncope and may involve pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators depending on the precise cardiac cause.
Society and culture.
Fainting in women was a commonplace trope or stereotype in Victorian England and in contemporary and modern depictions of the period. This may have been partly due to genuine ill-health (the respiratory effects of corsets are frequently cited), but it was fashionable for women to affect an aristocratic frailty and create a scene by fainting at a dramatic moment.
Some individuals occasionally or frequently play the "fainting game" (also referred to in the US as the "choking game"), which involves the deliberate induction of syncope via voluntary restriction of blood flow to the brain, an action that can result in acute or cumulative brain damage and even death.

The Big Pitch

The Big Pitch is a competition run by the north-east UK based studio Moxie Makers. Competitors pitch their feature film ideas, to win with the UK’s highest production fund prize - production finance from Moxie Makers for their film (a minimum of £150,000) together with a post-production deal with Molinare, guaranteed UK distribution with Soda Makers and international sales representation with Moxiehouse Entertainment.
Background.
The Big Pitch was launched on 6 December 2007 and was open for 10 weeks. Over 200 projects applied for the scheme including multi-award winning filmmakers from around the UK. After thorough assessment of the applications a longlist of 30 was drawn up before 12 teams were invited for interview. After interviews the Moxie Panel selected 8 projects to enter The Big Pitch Training Programme based on talent, experience, marketability and quality.
The Big Pitch Training Programme kicked off with an intensive four-day induction and development workshop at the end of April. The workshop gave a structured overview of micro-budget feature film development and production with recognized industry experts speaking on their relevant areas of expertise. Whilst the eight teams were at the workshop to learn, they were also competing for just six places on the four-month development programme.
Following the workshop the teams then had three weeks to devise and deliver their project development plans in advance of the next elimination meeting in Cannes Film Festival on 16 May 2008. The Panel reconvened to eliminate two projects based on the strength of the projects and their progress during and after the workshop. The panel consisted of Christine Alderson and Hayley Manning (Moxie Makers), Lorianne Hall (Ipso Facto Films), Eve Gabereau (Soda Pictures), Mark Vennis (Moviehouse Entertainment) and Denise Parkinson (Bauer Media).
The six selected projects then spent four-months working to perfect their project and presentation as a whole. They worked with feedback from: a project mentor, a script editor, a poster/marketing pack designer, a casting director, a UK distributor and an international sales agent.
On 17 October 2008, the panel convened and made the final selection based on script quality, marketing plan, poster concept, UK Box Office potential, International potential, Awards Prospects and the applicants ability to deliver.
The Finalists.
Four teams reached the final. Audiences were encouraged to vote online for their favourite project by visiting The Big Pitch website. Voting opened on Wednesday 19 November 2008 and closed on the day of the final.
The Final.
The competition final took place in conjunction with Northern Lights Film Festival, which is held annually in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.
On 6 December 2008, at the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, the four finalists appeared on stage and had fifteen minutes to convince a live audience that their film should be made. The footage was filmed and available to download after the event.
Once the final team presented the audience votes were counted and the winner was announced at the awards ceremony that same evening. After all the votes were counted it was announced that there were literally just a few votes separating first and second place. Second place went to Derek Boyes' neo-noir thriller Blackout but the winners of The Big Pitch 08/09 with their psychological thriller Different Shades of Graham were Keith Lynch, David Lynch, Brad Watson and Simon Thomas.
Different Shades of Graham was produced during 2009 and premiered at the Northern Lights Film Festival 2009.

That Sinking Feeling

That Sinking Feeling is a 1980 comedy film written and directed by Bill Forsyth, his first film as a director. The film is set in his home city, Glasgow, Scotland. The young actors in film were members of the Glasgow Youth Theatre. The film also features Richard Demarco, the Edinburgh gallery owner, playing himself. The four main actors went on to feature in Forsyth's following film "Gregory's Girl".
Plot.
Ronnie (Robert Buchanan), Wal (Billy Greenlees), Andy (John Gordon Sinclair) and Vic (John Hughes) are four bored, unemployed teenagers from Glasgow. One day Ronnie comes up with the idea of stealing stainless steel sinks from a warehouse and selling them. Their plan involves dressing up as girls and using a chemical 'stop-motion' potion.
Locations.
Filming took place on location around the city of Glasgow; scenes featured locations such as Kelvingrove Park, Dennistoun, Springburn and Bishopbriggs railway stations, Cowcaddens, Sighthill and the "Butney" in Maryhill.
Dubbed soundtrack.
The film was released in the USA four years after the UK, following the success of "Gregory's Girl" and "Local Hero". For the American market, (MGM) the soundtrack was re-dubbed using more mainstream accents. The MGM version cost more to re-dub than the entire budget for the film itself.
In September 2009, a restored copy of the film was re-released on DVD by 2 Entertain. This has generated controversy however due to the use of the re-dubbed soundtrack, which had the effect of impinging upon the delivery of the dialogue and character of the film.

Richmond Hospital

Richmond Hospital (RH) is a medical facility located in Richmond, British Columbia. The Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCH) is responsible for Richmond Health Services and Richmond Hospital.
History.
Richmond Hospital first opened February 26, 1966 with 132 beds. It was first known as Richmond General Hospital. The first patient was admitted and the first baby was born in the hospital on March 17, 1966. The original building is now known as the "North Tower"; the "South Tower" was completed in 1980. In 1992 Richmond General Hospital was rebranded as "The Richmond Hospital" while the Minoru Residence extended care facility was opened two years later.
In 1997 the Westminster Health Centre building was opened to house administration, psychiatry and ambulatory care. The same year the hospital was amalgamated with the Vancouver/Richmond Health Board. In 1999, due to space opened up by opening the Westminster building, the Emergency Department and Diagnostic Imaging were considerably expanded.
The Vancouver/Richmond Health Board was re-structured to become part of the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, which includes "Richmond Health Services" as the local umbrella organization. The hospital is currently part of Richmond Health Services and now known simply as "Richmond Hospital" (without the "The").
Facilities and amenities.
RH is the only hospital in Richmond, British Columbia and is located close to Vancouver International Airport. 
It is a large urban community teaching hospital with 175 beds. It is affiliated with the University of British Columbia. The Emergency Department is open 24/7 and sees 45,000 patients annually.
RH is located on the Southeast corner of Westminster Highway and Gilbert Road. It serves the people of Richmond but also those from neighbouring communities and frequently patients coming from the nearby international airport. RH can provide most of the medical and surgical care for its patients. Some patients requiring highly specialized care would need to be transferred to tertiary care facilities in Vancouver. These include Vancouver General Hospital, St. Paul's Hospital, British Columbia's Children's Hospital and BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre.
Diagnostic imaging includes x-ray, CT scan, ultrasound, nuclear medicine and MRI. 
In addition to an established inpatient psychiatry unit and outpatient psychiatry services, a Psychiatric Emergency Unit was completed in March 2009 for short-term admission of psychiatric patients in crisis.
In September 2009, the new $6.5 million birth centre opened. It features 15 private maternity care rooms, a six-bed Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and a maternity-specific operating room and recovery area.
On April 8, 2009 the provincial government announced a $10 million upgrade package for RH. These renovations were completed in April, 2011 and include a expansion and upgrade to the Emergency Department ($4.9 million), expansion of ambulatory surgical services ($2.9 million) and an expansion and upgrade of the Sterile Processing Department ($2.4 million).
Non-medical amenities and enhancements include a large atrium inside the main entrance where one can find a Starbuck's and a gift shop. There is a cafeteria on the second floor. There are several well-maintained gardens on the hospital property. The hospital is right beside Minoru Park which has many foot paths, trees and several small lakes.

Amphitheatre of the Three Gauls

The Amphitheatre of the Three Gauls () of Lugdunum (Lyon) was part of the federal sanctuary of the three Gauls dedicated to the cult of Rome and Augustus celebrated by the 60 Gallic tribes when they gathered at Lugdunum. In 1961, it was classified as monument historique.
History.
First building.
The amphitheatre was built at the foot of the La Croix-Rousse hill at what was then the confluence of the Rhône and Saône . An inscription on one of the blocks found in 1957 ("Inscription latine des Trois Gaules", n°217 ("AE" 1959, n°61)) allows the amphitheatre to be connected with the sanctuary of Rome and Augustus and allows its origins to be identified :
[…]E TI(beris) CAESARIS AVG(vsti) AMPHITHEATR
[…]ODIO C IVL C[?] RVFVS SACERDOS ROM(ae) ET AVG(vsti)
[…]FILII F. ET NEPOS [-]X CIVITATE SANTON. D(e) S(ua). P(ecunia).FECERVNT
Which can be completed as
This dates the building to 19 A.D. The figures who financed its construction belonged to an old Gallic family in Saintes which had held Roman citizenship since the Gallic Wars and also built the arch of Germanicus there. The curious formula "filii f(ilius)" perhaps derives from a wish to affirm the antiquity and continuity of the family's lineage, as on the arch of Germanicus, which names Rufus's ancestors.
Other stones bear the names of Gallic tribes (Arverni, Tricasses, Bituriges) confirming its identification as federal sanctuary.
Excavations have revealed a basement of three elliptical walls linked by cross-walls and a channel surrounding the oval central arena. The arena was slightly sloped, with the building's south part supported by a now-vanished vault. The arena's dimensions are 67.6m by 42m, analogous to those at the arenas at Nîmes and Arles, though with a smaller number of rows of seats (probably only 4 levels) that gave the amphitheatre external dimensions of 81m by 60m (much smaller than those of Nîmes, which was 133m by 101m).
This phase of the amphitheatre housed games which accompanied the imperial cult, with its low capacity (1,800 seats) being enough for delegations from the 60 Gallic tribes.
Expansion.
The amphitheatre was expanded at the start of the 2nd century, according to J. Guey by C. Julius Celse, procurator of Gallia Lugdunensis from 130 to 136. Two galleries were added around the old amphitheatre, raising its width from 25 metres to 105 metres and its capacity to about 20,000 seats (though this was still modest compared to the amphitheatres at Nîmes and Arles). In so doing it made it a building open to the whole population of Lugdunum and its environs. Historians identify the building as the site of Saints Blandina and Pothinus's martyrdoms as part of the persecution in 177 and a post in the middle of the arena commemorates this event and Pope John-Paul II's visit to Lyon in 1986.
Rediscovery.
A 16th century plan of Lyon indicates the survival to that date of some arches (probably substructures) and a hollow (the arena) known as "Corbeille de la Déserte". The first excavations between 1818 and 1820 revealed the perimeter of the arena before re-covering it, allowing urban expansion in the 19th century to destroy the south half of the amphitheatre remains. From 1956 serious excavations were begun, followed by 1966/67, 1971/72 and 1976/78 campaigns, leading to the exposed remains on show today. The modest remains which had survived (the supporting walls for half of the amphitheatre's superstructure) were integrated into the Jardin des Plantes and opened to visitors.

John Lill (cricketer)

Dr John Charles Lill (born 7 December 1933 in Adelaide) is a former Australian first-class cricketer who represented South Australia. He was a member of the South Australian team which won the Sheffield Shield in 1963/64.
A right-handed top order batsman, Lill was good enough to tour New Zealand in 1959/60 with the Australian national cricket team. He played two matches against New Zealand but they weren't given Test status. This was because it was in effect a 'Second XI', with the first choice players given a rest after back to back tours of India and Pakistan. Lill fared poorly in his four innings, scoring 1, 15, 6 and 0.
Back home, Lill had his most prolific season in 1960/61 when he amassed 809 runs in all first-class fixtures, at an average of 42.57. His only first-class wicket was Victorian batsman Jack Potter, whom he dismissed for 156, caught by Barry Jarman in 1962.
Lill was also a talented footballer and played in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) with Norwood. A centre half forward, Lill was Norwood's top goal-kicker in 1961 and 1962, with 40 and 52 goals respectively. He participated in the famous 1961 'Bloodbath' Grand Final against West Adelaide. His father Alick Lill won a Magarey Medal during his time at Norwood.
In 1983 he was appointed as Secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club and also served as CEO. He remained in this role until 2000. Lill holds a Bachelor of Chemical Engineering from the University of Adelaide.

Great Comet of 1744

The Great Comet of 1744, whose official designation is C/1743 X1, and which is also known as Comet de Chéseaux or Comet Klinkenberg-Chéseaux, was a spectacular comet that was observed during 1743 and 1744. It was discovered independently in late November 1743 by Jan de Munck, in the second week of December by Dirk Klinkenberg, and, four days later, by Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux. It became visible with the naked eye for several months in 1744 and displayed dramatic and unusual effects in the sky. Its absolute magnitude — or intrinsic brightness — of 0.5 was the sixth highest in recorded history. Its apparent magnitude may have reached as high as -7, leading it to be classified among what are called the "Great Comets". This comet is noted especially for developing a 'fan' of six tails after reaching its perihelion.
Discovery.
The comet was discovered on November 29, 1743, by Jan de Munck at Middelburg, and was independently sighted on December 9, 1743 by Klinkenberg at Haarlem, and by Chéseaux from the observatory at Lausanne on December 13. Chéseaux said it lacked a tail and resembled a nebulous star of the third magnitude; he measured the coma as five minutes across.
The comet brightened steadily as it approached perihelion. By February 18, 1744, it reportedly was as bright as the planet Venus (with an apparent magnitude of -4.6) and at this time displayed a double tail.
Perihelion, "six tails".
The comet reached perihelion about March 1, 1744, when it was 0.2 astronomical units from the sun. At about this time it was bright enough to be observed in daylight with the naked eye. As it moved away from perihelion, a spectacular tail developed — extending well above the horizon while the comet's head remained invisible due to the morning twilight. In early March 1744, Chéseaux and several other observers reported an extremely unusual phenomenon — a 'fan' of six separate tails rose above the horizon.
The tail structure was a puzzle to astronomers for many years. Although other comets had displayed multiple tails on occasion, the 1744 comet was unique by having six. It has been suggested that the 'fan' of tails was generated by as many as three active sources on the cometary nucleus, exposed in turn to solar radiation as the nucleus rotated. It also has been proposed that the tail phenomenon was a very prominent example of the "dust striae" seen in the tails of some comets, such as Comet West and C/2006 P1 (McNaught).
Other observations.
Chéseaux, on March 9, was the last known observer in the northern hemisphere to see the comet, but it remained visible for observers in the southern hemisphere, some of whom reported a tail length of approximately 90 degrees on March 18. The comet was not seen after April 22, 1744.
The comet also was noted in Chinese astronomical records. Researchers have found that some of their observations describe audible sounds associated with the comet, which may, if true, have resulted from the interaction of particles with the Earth's magnetosphere, as sometimes described for the aurora.
Among those who saw the comet was the thirteen-year-old Charles Messier, on whom it had a profound and inspirational effect. He went on to become a significant figure in astronomy, and later discovered many comets during his observations.

<doc id="20255436" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20255436" title="Iron metallurgy in Africa">
Iron metallurgy in Africa

African iron metallurgy encompasses a study of iron production across the continent and an understanding of how it influenced aspects of African archaeology. Extraordinary diversity has originated from iron production creating advanced farming techniques through tools, deadly warfare and valuable items for trade. These developments subsequently influenced social, cultural and political aspects of African life.
Archaeological evidence.
Archaeological evidence for iron production has often been based on iron artifacts found in the field. Artefacts are often in poor condition from corrosion and can be unidentifiable. Basing a context of origins to the specimens is unreliable as it is possible that the artifact may have been made somewhere completely different from where it was discovered (possibly even imported!). Solid evidence for iron production includes; the used bowl (foundation) of furnaces, tuyères and slag (from the furnace or forging process). The bloom itself and bellows are rarely found. Evidence of mining and beneficiation of iron ore can also be used as evidence; however it is possible that after beneficiation the ore travelled far to the next stage of production. Evidence for mining is often lost due to more recent mining of iron ore outcrops. Dating can be done through slag analysis and radiocarbon dating of the charcoal used to fuel the furnace. Both of these pieces of evidence are useful as they will always be produced in all smelting even if the technique varies. Metallography and petrographic analysis are also performed on specimens of slag and charcoal to help understand the conditions created within the furnace. Archaeologists have made reconstructions of the technology used for iron smelting as an important process in understanding how the ancient technology worked and to inspire confidence that their perception of the techniques used are correct.
Techniques.
Iron ore is readily available over Africa. Often a diagnostic red colour, it would have made it easy to make surface finds. Common ores used were likely to be hematite, magnetite and limonite (Childs et al. 2005 pg 282). The production process included mining, beneficiation, travel, smithing and forging. The mining and preparation of ores was carried out by men, women and children. It is likely that beneficiation occurred relatively near the site so the iron ore was then ready for transportation to the smelting site or alternatively ready to be traded. The original iron production technique in Africa is thought to have been the 'bloomery process'. Bowl, shaft and natural draft furnaces have been recovered. Iron ore would be put into a furnace along with charcoal at temperatures ranging 1,100–1,200 °C. For this process it would have been necessary for the smelters to use tuyères to blow oxygen into the furnace creating the high temperatures necessary. As the iron separated from the waste slag the raw iron product is called the bloom. The bloom is then removed, reheated and forged by a smith into shapes for use. Evidence from the shape of slag found at smelting sites suggested the furnaces were tapped.
Uses.
Iron was not the only metal to be used in Africa; copper and brass were widely utilised too. However the steady spread of iron meant it must have had more favourable properties for many different uses. Its durability over copper meant that it was used to make many tools from farming pieces to weaponry. Iron was used for personal adornment in jewelry, impressive pieces of artwork and even instruments. It was used for coins and currencies of varying forms. For example kisi pennies; a traditional form of iron currency used for trading in West Africa. They are twisted iron rods ranging from <30 cm to >2m in length. Suggestions for their uses vary from marital transactions, or simply that they were a convenient shape for transportation, melting down and reshaping into a desired object. There are many different forms of iron currency, often regionally differing in shape and value. Iron did not replace other materials, such as stone and wooden tools, but the quantity of production and variety of uses met were significantly high by comparison.
Social and cultural significance.
It is important to recognize that while iron production had great influence over Africa both culturally in trade and expansion (Martinelli, 1993, 1996, 2004), as well as socially in beliefs and rituals, there is great regional variation. Much of the evidence for cultural significance comes from the practises still carried out today by different African cultures. Ethnographical information has been very useful in reconstructing the events surrounding iron production in the past, however the reconstructions could have become distorted through time and influence by anthropologist's studies.
The Iron Age of Africa was based around the agricultural revolution, driven by the use of iron tools. Tools for cultivation and farming made production far more efficient and possible on much larger scales. Fishing hooks, arrow heads and spears aided hunting. Iron weapons also influenced warfare. These items, in addition to the production of other iron goods helped stimulate economic activity, the rise of chiefdoms and even states. The control of iron production was often by ironworkers themselves, or a "central power" in larger societies such as kingdoms or states (Barros 2000, p. 154). The demand for trade is believed to have resulted in some societies working only as smelters or smiths, specialising in just one of the many skills necessary to the production process. It is possible that this also led to tradesmen specialising in transporting and trading iron (Barros 2000, pg152). However not every region benefited from industrialising iron production, some suffered environmentally from problems that arose due to the massive deforestation required to provide the charcoal for fuelling furnaces (for example the ecological crisis of the Mema Region (Holl 2000, pg48)).
Iron smelters and smiths received different social status depending on their culture. Some were lower in society due to the aspect of manual labour and associations with witchcraft, for example in the Maasai and Tuareg (Childs et al. 2005 pg 288). In other cultures the skills are often passed down through family and would receive great social status (sometimes even considered as witchdoctors) within their community. Their powerful knowledge allowed them to produce materials on which the whole community relied. In some communities they were believed to have such strong supernatural powers that they were regarded as highly as the king or chief. For example an excavation at the royal tomb of King Rugira (Great Lakes, Eastern Africa) found two iron anvils placed at his head (Childs et al. 2005, p. 288 in Herbert 1993:ch.6), suggesting their importance and powerful significance. In some cultures mythical stories have been built around the premise of the iron smelter emphasising their god like significance.
Rituals.
The smelting process was often carried out away from the rest of the community. Ironworkers became experts in rituals to encourage good production and to ward off bad spirits, including song and prayers, plus the giving of medicines and even sacrifices. The latter are usually put in the furnace itself or buried under the base of the furnace. Examples of these date back as far as the early Iron Age in Tanzania and Rwanda (Schmidt 1997 in Childs et al., 2005 p. 293).
Some cultures associated sexual symbolism with iron production. Smelting is integrated with the fertility of their society, as with natural reproduction the production of the bloom is compared to the conception and birth. There are many strict taboos surrounding the process. The smelting process is carried out entirely by men and often away from the village. For women to touch any of the materials or be present could jeopardise the success of the production. With the men away from the fertile women it reduces temptation which otherwise could depreciate the productivity of the smelt. The furnaces are also often extravagantly adorned to resemble a woman, the mother of the bloom.

La Croix-Rousse

"This zone is served by the metro line "
La Croix-Rousse is a hill in the town of Lyon, France, as well as the name of a quarter located on this hill (divided into two halves - the pentes, a part of the town's 1st arrondissement, and the plateau, in its 4th arrondissement). It is 254m at its peak. It is near the Place des Terreaux.
The quarter is heavily marked by silk industry (Lyons was the centre of silk manufacture in Europe).
The quarter is called La Croix-Rousse (The russet cross) because of the cross the Christians put there in the 16th century: made in stone from Couzon-au-Mont-d'Or, it was reddish-brown.
In Lyon, La Croix-Rousse is nicknamed "la colline qui travaille" (the hill that works) in contrast to the better-known hill to the southwest, Fourvière, which is known as "la colline qui prie" (the hill that prays).
The district started developing in the 18th century when the silk workshops moved here from the Vieux Lyons area. The "canuts" (silk workers) were subject to extremely poor working conditions. On account of these conditions, they staged many worker uprisings, known as the Canut revolts. The first revolt, in October 1831 is considered to be one of the very first worker uprisings. 
The area was immortalised in Paul-Jacques Bonzon's book series "Les Six Compagnons", which depicts the adventures of seven young working class teenagers from the area.

Diesel (game engine)

The Diesel engine is a game engine developed and used by GRIN. The engine was originally developed for their game "Ballistics" and has been used, albeit with modifications, in a number of other games since then. The first installment of the engine was developed in close collaboration with NVIDIA, aimed to showcase the capabilities of their latest graphics chip at the time, the GeForce 3. The engine is now being used by Overkill Software, as the former owners of GRIN are the same people running Overkill Software. Overkill's game, "Payday: The Heist", uses a modified version of this engine. Payday 2 uses the second generation Diesel engine 2.0.
