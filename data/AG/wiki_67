Aeropolis 2001

The Aeropolis 2001 was a proposed 500-story high-rise building over Tokyo Bay in Japan, envisioned by Obayashi Corp.. With a height of , the mammoth structure would have been approximately five times as high as the former World Trade Center in New York City.
The Aeropolis 2001 was proposed in 1989, amid a spate of similar projects for incredibly large buildings. All were proposed during the Japanese asset price bubble, which ended in the early 1990s. According to a 1995 article, the corporation still had plans for the structure, and gave a proposed height of .
At the time it proposed Aeropolis 2001, Obayashi Corp. also proposed building a city on the moon by 2050. Newspapers have reported little on either proposal since 1995.
Proposed details.
Newspapers reported that plans called for the building to have 500 floors accommodating over 300,000 working inhabitants and 140,000 live-in residents. The structure was expected to be mixed-use, including restaurants, offices, apartments, cinemas, schools, hospitals, and post offices. It would have offered eleven square kilometers of floor space.
A shuttle lift, with 300 seats, would have gone from the ground floor to the top floor in 15 minutes, and stopped at every 40th floor. The proposal called for the tower to be fully sustainable and air conditioned.

Murfreesboro Municipal Airport

Murfreesboro Municipal Airport is a city-owned, public-use airport located two nautical miles (4 km) north of the central business district of Murfreesboro, a city in Rutherford County, Tennessee, United States. This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a "general aviation" airport. Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned MBT by the FAA, but has no designation from the IATA (which assigned MBT to Masbate Airport in the Philippines).
It is also the home of the Middle Tennessee State University Aerospace Department, which has one of the largest university Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) programs in the country, and their aircraft and simulators. Aircraft owned by MTSU include a Boeing 727, 19 Diamond DA-40s, three Piper PA-28R Arrows, two Piper PA-44 Seminoles, three Cessna 152s, a Piper Super Cub, a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, a Beechcraft King Air 200, a Cessna T-41, and a Cessna 172RG.
The Murfreesboro Municipal Airport is one of the only general aviation airports in the State of Tennessee that does not receive tax payer money. The money used to maintain the airport is entirely generated by leases and fuel sales.
In 2007 the airport won the ""Tennessee Airport of the Year"" award.

Life Is Hot in Cracktown

Life Is Hot in Cracktown is a 2009 crime drama film based on Buddy Giovinazzo's eponymous 1993 collection of short stories. Giovinazzo directed and wrote the film.
Plot.
The film intertwines several unsettling stories of people in a Manhattan neighborhood ravaged by crack cocaine.
Romeo, a 14-year-old criminal, leads his gang into robbing and torturing a very sick pensioner, and then steps up to doing a murder-for-hire at the behest of a local drug dealer, unaware of the enormous risks.
Manny and Concetta, a young couple, are desperately trying to rise out of poverty and care for their sick baby. Manny works two jobs - the front desk of a drug-riddled flop house by day and the cash register of a frequently-robbed bodega at night. It hardly matters that he is working so hard because the baby's non-stop crying will not allow him to sleep.
Another young couple, Marybeth and Benny, are both drug addicts, and Marybeth is actually a pre-op transexual named Mickey. Marybeth makes a bit of money as a street prostitute, and Benny is into very low-paying burglaries. Their principal source of drugs is a well-off transexual named Ridley, who is looking to follow in Marybeth's footsteps.
Young Willy and younger Susie are the much-neglected children of an addict named Mommy, who makes them sleep on the floor of their one room apartment. Mommy's current boyfriend, a hot-tempered addict named Chaz, makes the children beg on the street for his drug money. Willy's one bright spot is neighbor child Melody, whose mother pimps her out every night. When Chaz and Mommy leave the children behind while they embark on a drug-fueled quest to get more drug money from a relative of Chaz, and Melody is picked up by the police. Willy, meanwhile, is sent on a wild goose chase by Betty, an aging prostitute who enjoys tormenting her neighbors.

Jason Binn

In the summer of 2012, Jason Binn founded DuJour Media Group, LLC, publisher of DuJour magazine, an innovative, multi-platform digital and print magazine utilizing targeted analytics to reach more than 3 million readers and users monthly across the country. This publication targets the affluent market and chronicles the vibrant world of the wealthiest and most inspiring individuals. DuJour’s strategic partners include Gilt Groupe and James Cohen of Hudson News and Dufry. DuJour’s stellar roster of editors, writers, stylists and photographers bring cutting-edge content to the forefront in the worlds of fashion, design, food, travel, art and politics, both locally and nationally. The company was profitable within its first year of operation. 
Prior to the launch of DuJour, Binn founded Niche Media Holdings in 1998, a leading publisher of luxury regional magazines nationwide. In 2006, Binn sold Niche Media for an undisclosed sum to the Greenspun Media Group (GMG). In 2007, GMG purchased the Ocean Drive Media Group, of which Binn was also an equity holder and founder, and merged operations to form Niche Media, creating one of the largest networks of exclusive, city-specific and custom-publishing companies in the country (titles include: Art Basel Miami Beach, Aspen Peak, Boston Common, Capitol File, Gotham, Hamptons, Los Angeles Confidential, Michigan Avenue, Ocean Drive, Philadelphia Style, Vegas and Wynn). After the successful merger and transition, Binn continued to oversee the operations and management of the company as CEO until his departure in 2010.
In August 2010, Binn engaged the digital e-commerce space and was retained as a senior adviser to Gilt Groupe. In this position, Binn worked across each of Gilt Groupe’s platforms, nurturing and developing relationships and creating strategic partnerships. Gilt established itself as a leading online retailer in the U.S. and Japan with a broad range of daily sales for its several million invitation-only members. Launched in 2007, Gilt Groupe reported gross revenues of $25 million in 2008 and currently does approximately $600 million in annual revenue.
In September 2011, Binn created a strategic partnership with Getty Images and WireImage, a leading creator and distributor of digital media. Binn’s partnership with Getty/WireImage promotes his personal photography, archives and BinnShot (which he edits). The Featured Events section is visible on WireImage’s entertainment tab (Binnshot.com), which appear on the home page. All proceeds benefit Best Buddies International, founded by Anthony Shriver, a non-profit organization (for which Binn serves as a board member) dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement creating opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment and leadership development for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Binn’s career began when he co-founded Ocean Drive at age 25, building what Business Week called “a fast-growing empire” of upscale glossies that cornered the regional publishing market, becoming the country’s preeminent local luxury magazines. In 2005, Binn was profiled in Forbes magazine’s “Forbes 400.” In 2006, he was awarded Ernst & Young’s “Entrepreneur of the Year,” and in 2007, he was inducted into the American Advertising Federation’s “Advertising Hall of Achievement” (the only magazine recipient for that year). In 2008, Binn was featured in Crain’s coveted “40 Under 40” list of successful entrepreneurs. In 2009, Dean Tom Fielder presented Binn with Boston University’s “Distinguished Alumni Award for Service to the Profession” for his leadership and cutting-edge work in the field of communications.

Baby Fae

Stephanie Fae Beauclair (October 14, 1984 – November 15, 1984), better known as Baby Fae, was an American infant born in 1984 with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. She became the first infant subject of a xenotransplant procedure, receiving the heart of a baboon. The procedure, performed by Leonard L. Bailey at Loma Linda University Medical Center, was successful, but Fae died 21 days later of heart failure due to rejection of the transplant. The rejection is thought to be have been caused largely by a humoral response against the graft, due to Fae's type O blood creating antibodies against the type AB xenograft. The blood type incompatibility was seen as unavoidable: fewer than 1% of baboons are type O, and Loma Linda only had seven young female baboons – all of which were type AB – available as potential donors. It was hoped that the transplant could be replaced by an allograft at a later date, before Fae's body began generating isohaemagglutinins, but a suitable donor could not be found in time. The procedure was subject to a wide ethical and legal debate, but the attention that it generated is thought to have paved the way for Bailey to perform the first successful infant allograft heart transplant a year later.
The Baby Fae case, and Bailey's role in it, has been a popular case study in the realm of medical ethics. Bailey did not look for a human heart for Fae. There were questions as to whether parents should be allowed to volunteer children for experimental medical procedures, and whether the parents themselves were properly informed by Bailey. However, because Fae's mother had no medical insurance, she could not afford to pay for the heart transplant procedure. The xenograft, on the other hand, was offered for free. When asked why he had picked a baboon over a primate more closely related to humans in evolution, he replied "Er, I find that difficult to answer. You see, I don't believe in evolution." Charles Krauthammer, writing in "Time", said the Baby Fae case was totally within the realm of experimentation and was "an adventure in medical ethics." Ultimately, the American Medical Association and top medical journals criticized Bailey, concluding that xenografts should be undertaken only as part of a systematic research program with controls in randomized clinical trials.
Although Fae's full name was not made public at the time of the procedure, her mother chose to reveal herself in 1997.

McLure Ferry

The McLure Ferry is a cable ferry across the North Thompson River in British Columbia, Canada. It is situated about north of Kamloops. 
Specifically, the ferry is a reaction ferry, which is propelled by the current of the water. An overhead cable is suspended from towers anchored on either bank of the river, and a "traveller" is installed on the cable. The ferry is attached to the traveller by a bridle cable. To operate the ferry, rudders are used to ensure that the pontoons are angled into the current, causing the force of the current to move the ferry across the river. 
The ferry operates under contract to the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation, is free of tolls, and runs on demand between 0700 and 1820. It carries a maximum of 2 cars and 12 passengers at a time. The crossing is about in length, and takes 5 minutes. The ferry does not operate at times of high water or winter freeze up.

Tuscumbia is a ghost town in Bernadotte Township, Fulton County, Illinois, USA that sprang up in the township and was platted by Wade Hampton on 2 March 1837. It consisted of 54 lots. It flourished for a while and had a school, but by 1855 was abandoned. 
A sign on County Road 14, known as the Bernadotte blacktop, nine miles west of Lewistown, Illinois, is the only remnant.
History.
Illinois was experiencing rapid settlement during the time of the settlement, and the timeframe of Tuscumbia coincides with the career of Abraham Lincoln. In 1838, Lincoln visited the county seat Lewistown nine miles east of the Tuscumbia area extending the range of his law practice. A Lincoln-Douglas debate occurred in August 1858 in Lewistown.

Tęgoborze Prophecy

Tegoborze Prophecy (Polish: "Przepowiednia z Tegoborza") is a verse composition, which describes post-World War One and post-World War Two fate of Poland. Its origins date back to late 19th century, however, its author and exact date of creation have not been confirmed so far.
History.
The history of the prophecy begins in 1893 in Tegoborze, a village located in southern Lesser Poland. The village belonged to Count Wladyslaw Wieloglowski, who was keenly interested in paranormal activities, occultism and clairvoyance. Wieloglowski frequently invited there various fortune tellers and other persons who claimed magical abilities. 
On September 23 of that year, a mysterious woman appeared in Wieloglowski’s house. She stated she was a medium and offered to foresee future. Apparently, she got into touch with a ghost, which left her a message concerning Poland’s fate. Wieloglowski, who was present during the session, wrote everything in his diary.
A few years later, after the Count’s death, the house was inherited by his relative Aleksander Wieloglowski, who decided to remodel the complex and found an archive, with words of the prophecy. Since he was not interested in it, he decided to hand it to the Ossolineum library in Lwow, where it was carefully stored as the Tegoborze Prophecy. 
At first, the composition did not raise interest and was not taken seriously. In 1912, the Gazeta Narodowa newspaper published it, together with a Russian translation. In the following years, the prophecy was forgotten, but this changed on March 27, 1939, a few months before German and Soviet invasion on Poland. The popular Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny daily published the text, together with an article about its history. Thousands of readers got to know the composition, and it became extremely popular during the war, when Poland was occupied by the two powers - Nazi Germany and Soviet Union. It raised spirits of the oppressed Poles, giving them hope for a better future of their homeland.
Current whereabouts of the original text of the prophecy are not known. It was lost during the war and has not been found.

Name of the author of the prophecy is not known. In the Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny, it was signed as an anonymous medium, while the 1912 Gazeta Narodowa wrote that it was written by a ghost of Adam Mickiewicz, which appeared in the house of Count Wieloglowski in 1893. 
Stanislaw Hadyna, a journalist and composer, came up with a different author. According to him, the author of the prophecy is Agnieszka Pilchowa, a popular interbellum period clairvoyant. However, considering Pilchowa’s date of birth, it is not likely.

Ed Gass-Donnelly (born August 17, 1977 in Toronto, Ontario) is an award-winning Canadian film director, screenwriter and producer. His work often explores themes of death, colliding worlds and the darker sides of human nature. His characters are everyday people who are put in extraordinary situations and left to fend for themselves. Stylistically, Gass-Donnelly's films follow non-linear plot structures with multiple storylines.
His first full-length film, "This Beautiful City", was released in 2008 and nominated for four Genies at the 29th Genie Awards. He previously directed the short films "Polished", "Dying Like Ophelia", "Pony" and "Pink". January 2011 he was selected as one of the top ten film makers to watch.

Gerald Schoenfeld

Gerald Schoenfeld (September 22, 1924 – November 25, 2008) was chairman of the Shubert Organization from 1972-2008.
Career.
After graduating from the University of Illinois, Schoenfeld fought in World War II. On his return, he obtained a law degree from New York University and got a job with a local law firm then known as Klein & Weir. One of the firm's clients was the Shubert Organization, which was represented by Adolph Lund, a partner in the firm and a name partner when the firm's name was changed to Klein & Lund. After Adolph Lund's death at age 49 on January 1, 1957, Jacob J. Shubert, the surviving Shubert brother, hired Schoenfeld to represent him and his interests. Schoenfeld was 32 at the time. Later that same year, Jacob J. Shubert, encouraged Schoenfeld to hire a second primary lawyer. Schoenfeld hired his brother's childhood friend, Bernard B. Jacobs.
A power struggle for control of the organization followed J.J. Shubert's death in 1963. By 1972, Schoenfeld and Jacobs had taken control of the organization. Schoenfeld tended to manage the maintenance and operational aspect of the theaters, while Jacobs was more involved in the artistic aspect. The two are credited with pulling American theater out of a steep downward spiral in the early 1970s and making it into a profitable enterprise.
, the Shubert Organization owned 17 Broadway theaters, one off-Broadway theater, and major theaters in Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.. It remains the preeminent organization in American theater.
In 2004, Broadway's Plymouth Theatre was renamed The Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre in his honor.

<doc id="20396858" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20396858" title="Bovista">
Bovista

Bovista is a genus of fungi in the family Agaricaceae, commonly known as the true puffballs. It was formerly classified within the now-obsolete order Lycoperdales, which, following a restructuring of fungal taxonomy brought about by molecular phylogeny, has been split; the species of "Bovista" are now placed in the family Agaricaceae of the order Agaricales. The 46 species have a widespread distribution, and are found largely in temperate regions of the world. Various species have historically been used in homeopathic preparations.
Description.
Fruit bodies are oval to spherical to pear-shaped, and typically in diameter with a white or light-colored thin and fragile exoperidum (outer layer of the peridium). Depending on the species, the exoperidium in a young specimen may be smooth, granular, or finely echinulate. This exoperidium sloughs off at maturity to expose a smooth endoperidium with an apical pore. They may be attached to the ground by fine rhizomorphs that may appear like a small cord in some species. Spores are brown to purple-brown, roughly spherical or ellipsoid in shape, and 3.5–7 μm in diameter.
At maturity, the entire fruit body may become detached from the ground, and the spores spread as the puffball is blown around. In "Bovista", the capillitium (a network of thread-like cells in which the spores are embedded) are not connected directly to the peridial wall, but rather, they are made of separate units and branch irregularly, ending in tapered points.
Edibility.
Puffballs of the genus "Bovista" are generally edible when young and white inside, but caution must be taken to prevent confusion with immature, and potentially deadly "Amanitas". This is done by cutting fruit bodies longitudinally to ensure that they are white throughout, and do not have internal structures within.
Phylogeny.
Phylogenetic analysis has shown that "Bovista", as defined by Kreisel, is monophyletic. Also, "Bovista" may be split into two clades, "Bovista" and "Globaris", that roughly correspond to the subgeneric divisions suggested by Kreisel.
"Bovistina" is a related but separate genus that was created to describe species with the external features of a puffball, but with the glebal characters of a Geaster. "Bovistella" is another similar genus, it may be distinguished from "Bovista" by its ample sterile base.
Use in homeopathy.
Reference to the genus has appeared in several 19th-century textbooks on homeopathy. Richard Hughes wrote in "A Manual of Pharmacodynamics" (1870) "Bovista is said to be indicated, and to have proved curative in head affections characterised by a sensation as if the head were enormously increased in size". In "Lectures on Clinical Materia Medica" (1887), E. A. Farrington claims that "Bovista" spores restrict blood circulation through the capillaries, and suggests uses associated with menstrual irregularity, or trauma. He also mentions that "Bovista" produces some symptoms of suffocation, and might be useful in remedying asphyxiation resulting from inhalation of charcoal fumes. Even more ailments have been suggested to be improved with use of Bovista, such as "awkwardness in speech and action", "stuttering or stammering children", "palpitation after a meal", diabetes mellitus, ovarian cysts, and "acne due to cosmetics".

Usk Ferry

The Usk Ferry is a cable ferry across the Skeena River in British Columbia, Canada. It is situated about north-east of Terrace at Usk. 
Technically, the ferry is a reaction ferry, which is propelled by the current of the water. An overhead cable is suspended from towers anchored on either bank of the river, and a "traveller" is installed on the cable. The ferry is attached to the traveller by a bridle cable. To operate the ferry, either the right or left bridle cable is tightened to angle the pontoons into the current, causing the force of the current to move the ferry across the river.
The ferry operates under contract to the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation, is free of tolls, and runs on demand between 0615 and 2345 with some gaps in service. It carries a maximum of 2 cars and 12 passengers at a time. The crossing is about in length, and takes 5–7 minutes. At times of low water, or ice in the river, the ferry is replaced by an aerial tramway that carries passengers only.

James W. Reilly

James William Reilly (May 20, 1828 – November 6, 1905) was a lawyer, politician, and soldier from the state of Ohio who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He commanded a brigade and then a division in the Army of the Ohio in several campaigns in the Western Theater of operations.
Early life and career.
Reilly was born May 20, 1828, in Akron, Ohio. He was educated at Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, and later studied law. He passed his bar exam and established a successful practice in Wellsville, Ohio, in Columbiana County. In 1858, he entered politics, and was elected as a Republican to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he eventually supported the policies of President Abraham Lincoln.
Civil War service.
In August 1862, Reilly joined the military, accepting an appointment as the colonel of the 104th Ohio Infantry. After training at Camp Massillon, he and his men were assigned to various garrisons and posts in Kentucky, where they operated against Edmund Kirby Smith and John Hunt Morgan. Reilly and the regiment moved to Covington, Kentucky, on September 1, 1862, in preparation for the Defense of Cincinnati against a threatened Confederate invasion by troops under Kirby Smith. Reilly was then involved in the subsequent Skirmish at Fort Mitchell in northern Kentucky.
In the summer of 1863, Reilly's 104th OVI was assigned to Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside's Army of the Ohio during its campaign in East Tennessee, including operations around the Cumberland Gap. They marched to Knoxville and joined the XXIII Corps. In the autumn of 1863, Reilly commanded a brigade of infantry in the XXIII Corps during the Siege of Knoxville. The following year, he led his brigade with competence during the Atlanta Campaign.
On July 30, 1864, Reilly was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers. Assigned command of the 3rd Division, XXIII Corps previously commanded by Jacob D. Cox, he performed well during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. During the Battle of Franklin, his troops initially broke in disarray under a heavy Confederate assault, but General Reilly managed to rally them and repulse the attack, capturing more than 1,000 prisoners and seizing 22 Confederate battle flags.
Reilly and his men were assigned in 1865 to the forces of Maj. Gen. John Schofield and participated in the Carolinas Campaign. He resigned from the army on April 20, 1865, and returned to Ohio.
Postbellum career.
Reilly resumed his legal career in Wellsville and became active in community affairs. He remained a force in local politics and helped support numerous Republican candidates. In 1873, he was a delegate to the Ohio state constitutional convention from Columbiana County.
He died in Wellsville at the age of 77 and was buried in its St. Elizabeth's Cemetery.
Upon death, his estate was awarded to the State of Ohio. There is a stadium and grade school in Salem, Ohio that was funded from part of his estate and bear his name to this date.

Nathan Manufacturing, Inc.

Nathan Manufacturing, Inc. is a division of Micro Precision Group which makes Airchime, Ltd. train horns for North America. It is one of two major horn manufacturers in the United States, Leslie Controls, Inc. being the other. Nathan horn manifolds are "stout and solid-looking", while Leslie's are "open and lacy." 
Products.
The K-series Airchime horn is considered "the industry standard" for railroads. It is sold to manufacturers of locomotives and to fleet operators. 
Nathan also makes P-series and M-series horns for railroads and CS-Series and KJ-series horns, KSV vertical mount horns, steam whistles, heated horn assemblies, electronic pressure regulators, control valves, flange lubricators and glo rod gauges.
P-series horns also include single tone (P1), three-chime (P3) and five-chime (P5) versions. The bells are sand-cast. Frequency ranges may be from 220 to 554 hertz.
The P-series horns have longer bells and a heavier manifold than the M-series. The name of the horn is a P followed by the bells that face forward, followed by R if any are reversed, and then the numbers of the reversed bells; a P12345 is a true five-chime horn with all bells facing forward, while P135R24 has bells 2 and 4 reversed.
History.
Robert Swanson started Airchime Ltd., starting out by making custom steam whistles in his British Columbia home. He liked the sound of steam whistles better than the single-chime horns made by Leslie and Westinghouse Air Brake Company. In 1949, he introduced the Hexatone 5 Chime (H5), of which some odd (60) were made according to Robert Eugene Swanson's personal manufacturing/sales records. The Hexatone H5 was only preceded by the Hexatone H6, of which (4), including a cast iron H6 prototype known as the 'Iron Maiden', were only produced and never sold in any quantity to any railroad and were considered experimental. The H-series and N-series, also rare, preceded the M-series manufactured by Nathan in the United States and Airchime Mfg. Co. of Vancouver, B.C., Canada. Airchime Mfg. Co's M3H became the standard 3-chime horn used in Canada. The Holden Co. Ltd. was the Canadian Distributor of Airchime Mfg. Co's locomotive air horns and steam whistles and did not manufacture any horns or whistles, a very common misconception.
Captain Charles Benter, who followed John Philip Sousa as Marine Corps Band conductor, played a role in developing what is called "the most melodic horn in railroading." The five-chime horn Swanson and Bentor came up with became the M-series horn, characterized by "short, fat bells and open manifold." The M3 had three chimes, and the M5 five chimes. Originally, the M5 had an A Major dominant chord (C-sharp, E, G, A, C-sharp). 
In the early 1950s, Swanson introduced the Nathan Truck Horn in T-E and T-5 versions. In 1953, the truck horn was refined for use on locomotives, becoming the P-series. Swanson, whose Airchime never made the horn, sold the rights to Nathan. He never liked the P-series considering the K-series to be the ultimate horn, with the P (Pre-set pitch) being a cheaper alternative. The P-series did its job, and was easier to repair than the M-series because each M-series bell had a separate diaphragm, while the P-series horns had the same diaphragm for each bell, a practice Leslie was already using. M-series horns also needed more frequent maintenance. The P-series was Nathan Mfg. Co's equivalent to the Leslie SuperTyfon.
The first generation P-series bells "used a phosphor-bronze diaphragm disk. Also, the orifice opened up into a fairly wide, oval-shaped hole in the horn's internal chamber." The second generation P-series diaphragm changed to stainless steel, and the opening was round. The changes made little difference in the sound.
The P3 was used by the first diesel engines of Illinois Central and Southern Pacific. The P5 was used for the passenger trains of Illinois Central, Rock Island and Southern Pacific. 
In 1954, the K5H/K3H made their debut, using a D-sharp minor chord (D-sharp, F-sharp, A-sharp) because of Canadian regulations. "H" stood for "high-pitched" because none of the low-pitched bells available were used. Later, "H" referred to high-profile manifold, while L stood for low-profile. The K5H is described as "unresolved" and "haunting". It was used by Norfolk Southern and CSX (some of whose older engines still use it), and by C&NW. Early K-series horns were sand-cast, like the P-series, but later ones would be die-cast.
In the early 1960s, Nathan introduced the low-profile P3 manifold, replacing a five-chime manifold used previously even though the horn had only three chimes. Southern Railway used this design.
Deane Ellsworth of Amtrak developed the P5a (A for Amtrak) in 1976. While the P5 had an A Major chord, the P5a changed the A to an A-sharp using a shorter bell. Also used by Amtrak was the P01235, with an "0" bell which was an octave lower than the #4 bell it replaced. 
In 1975, Amtrak asked for a change in the original K-series, with the third bell changed from A-sharp to G-sharp and the fourth from C to B. The K5LA designation included a "K" for the double-diaphragm kettle drum design, an "L" because of its low-profile manifold, and an "A" for American tuning, to differentiate it from Canadian tuning. By the later 1980s, the K5LA was North America's most popular locomotive horn.
In 1977, Nathan had two other foundries cast P bells, but new castings were used that did not have the right pitches. The 1, 2 and 3 bells had a slightly higher pitch, and the 5 bell a lower pitch. The result was D, F, G-sharp, A, C, not considered a chord. These horns are considered the third generation P series.
In 2005, Federal Railroad Administration regulations specified a maximum decibel level for horns, resulting in the development of the K5LLA (the extra "L" means low-pitched, with the first bell tuned to middle C) for EMD and K5HL for GE.

Pavonia Ferry

The Pavonia Ferry was a ferry service which conveyed passengers between New York City and Jersey City. It was launched in 1854. It was sold to the Pavonia Ferry Company of Jersey City for what was considered a low price of $9,050, at New York City Hall, in February 1854.
In February 1859 Nathaniel Marsh of the Erie Railroad Company purchased the lease on behalf of the Pavonia Ferry Company. He started a ferry which ran from Chambers Street (Manhattan) to the foot of Pavonia Avenue on the other side of the Hudson River. Legal problems had prevented the Pavonia Ferry Company from establishing a ferry along this route. The New York and Erie Railroad paid an annual rent of $9,050 to transport passengers back and forth. Eventually the railroad constructed its Pavonia Terminal on the landfilled Harsimus Cove. Suburban and long distance travellers would transfer from trains to boats for the passage across the river.
A January 18, 1903 letter from a Passaic, New Jersey reader to "The New York Times", commented about the inadequacy of the boats of the Pavonia Ferry, which was then the property of the Erie Railroad. "All their boats are old, small and entirely inadequate to accommodate the crowds during rush hours." The vessels
then in use by the Erie Railroad, listed with first year of service, were: "Pavonia" (1861), "Susquehanna" (1865), "Delaware" (1868), "Chatauqua"
(1868), "Passaic" (1869), "Ridgewood" (1873), "Paterson" (1886), and "J.G. McCullough" (1891).

William Goodyear

William "Billy" Goodyear (May 21, 1865 – June 18, 1936) was an American football coach, newspaper editor, publisher, and politician in Whitman County in eastern Washington. He was the first head coach of the Washington State Cougars football team, holding that position for the 1894 college football season. Goodyear was also a newspaper publisher and editor. His newspapers included the "Pullman Herald", the "Pullman News", the "Colfax Commoner" in Colfax, Washington, the "Palouse City News" in Palouse, Washington, and the "Pacific Farmers' Union". He was also active in Democratic Party politics and was the party's candidate for United States Congress in Washington's 3rd congressional district in 1908.
Early years and family.
Goodyear was born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1865 to Hannah (née Tuttle) and George Goodyear. He was described as coming from "good New England stock," and was a direct descendant of Stephen Goodyear, who served as deputy governor of the New Haven Plantation from 1643 to 1658. He attended public schools and graduated from Newton High School in Wellesley, Massachusetts. 
Goodyear attended Williams College and received his bachelor of arts degree there in 1887. While attending Williams, he was a member and president of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, editor of the "Literary Monthly", and a member of the college football and tug of war teams.
One week after completing his degree at Williams College, Goodyear moved west and settled in Spokane, Washington (then known as "Spokane Falls") in 1887. He entered the newspaper business as a reporter for the "Spokane Falls Review" (later known as "The Spokesman-Review") from 1887 to 1889, eventually becoming the city editor. In November 1890, he was married to Neva Carleton Shurtleff at a ceremony in Warren, Rhode Island. They had a son, Trevor Shurtleff Goodyear, born in January 1893 at Palouse, Washington.
Football coach.
In 1894, Goodyear became the first football coach at Washington State College (now known as Washington State University). He reportedly traveled from his home in Palouse, Washington each night to perform his coaching duties. Goodyear was not paid for teaching the team the elements of the game, and the school did not have a paid coach until 1900.
In the first game in the history of the Washington State Cougars football program, played on November 18, 1894, in Moscow, Idaho, Goodyear led the team to a 10–0 victory over Idaho. Eleven days later, the team suffered its first defeat, losing to the team from Spokane High School by a score of 18–0. Goodyear served only one year as the football coach, leading the team to a record of 1–1.
In October 1934, 40 years after the first Washington State football game, Goodyear and 12 of the players from the 1894 team were honored guests at Washington State's homecoming football game.
Publisher and politician.
Goodyear lived in Palouse, Washington in the early part of his career. In 1889, he purchased the "Palouse News" with partners P. H. Winton and Judge Norman Buck. Goodyear later became the newspaper's sole owner. He owned the newspaper and served as its publisher until 1898. In November 1894, he was nominated by Grover Cleveland as the postmaster at Palouse, and he served in that position during the second Cleveland administration.
Goodyear later moved to Colfax, Washington. In 1898, he purchased the "Colfax Commoner" and became its publisher and editor. While owned by Goodyear, the "Commoner" became known as "the leading democratic newspaper of eastern Washington". He was also active in Democratic Party politics in Colfax. When William Jennings Bryan visited the area during his 1900 presidential campaign, Goodyear introduced him as "the man whom the trusts hate, but the people love." Goodyear was nominated as the party's candidate for the United States Congress in 1902 but declined the nomination. In 1908, he ran for Congress, and was the Democratic candidate in Washington's 3rd congressional district which included the entire eastern portion of the state. Goodyear was defeated by Miles Poindexter as Republicans swept the 1908 elections throughout the state.
In 1901, Goodyear leased the plant of the "Pacific Farmer's Union", the official publication of the Farmers' Union, and the "Pullman Herald" and managed those papers as well as the "Colfax Commoner" for a time. Goodyear sold the "Commoner" in 1911 and moved to Pullman, where he purchased the plant of the "Pullman Herald". He was the publisher of the "Pullman Herald" until August 1935. 
In 1914, Goodyear was appointed as the receiver for the United States Land Office in Walla Walla, Washington. In 1918, he also became the chairman of the Pullman branch of the home service section of the Red Cross, providing relief to the homes of soldiers and sailors. During World War I, he was also the publicity director for the Liberty loan drives in Whitman County.
Goodyear was outspoken on public policy matters and was an advocate of, among other things, the direct primary system and Prohibition at both the state and national level.
Later years.
At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Goodyear and his wife Neva were living in Pullman. Goodyear's occupation was listed in the census record as a newspaper publisher. 
In January 1935, Goodyear's wife, Neva, died after breaking her shoulder in a fall while visiting their son, Trevor S. Goodyear, in Olympia, Washington.
In May 1936, Goodyear sustained a scratch on his toe that developed into gangrene. He was hospitalized in Colfax for several weeks, and doctors eventually amputated his leg just below the knee. He was discharged from the hospital and died weeks later at his son's home in Olympia.

Summers-Knoll School

Summers-Knoll School is a small, independent elementary school located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The school primarily focuses on child-centered education for students who are bright, creative and/or gifted. The school's mission is to 'enable bright, creative, and gifted children to realize their unique academic, social, and emotional potential in a beautiful, loving setting'.
Summers-Knoll is nut free, and is a Certified Michigan Green School.
Curriculum and Programs.
Project-based learning
The backbone of Summers-Knoll classroom work is project-based learning. Project-based learning allows a student to work authentically in ways that build academics while developing important collaborative skills. It develops a child’s sense of purpose by integrating learning with life. It encourages problem solving, risk taking, creativity and resilience. It creates space for children to learn from one another, to cultivate and extend the special talents and passions of their peers and to have confidence in their own contributions.
Monthly theme
The SK curriculum is based on monthly or bi-monthly themes, selected to offer academic opportunities across the range of disciplines. Themes are targeted towards investigation of particular subjects (art, math, science, language arts, etc.), but each theme is taught in an integrated, interdisciplinary way so that all subject areas are consistently and dynamically explored. Each theme is a platform for developing academics in the context of intellectual inquiry and community awareness.
Elementary programs change themes monthly, and middle school programs change themes bi-monthly. All students study various aspects of the theme at developmentally-appropriate levels of complexity and sophistication, generating opportunities for sharing activities across the classrooms and age groups. Students learn from students, mentor each other, share field trips, celebrations and reflections.
Assessments.
Summers-Knoll uses a portfolio-based assessment system based on the Work Sampling System. Narrative reports and formal and informal parent-teacher conferences are incorporated into assessments.
History.
Summers-Knoll School was founded in 1995 by Ruth Knoll (née Summers), wife of Photoshop creator Thomas Knoll. The school has been a major beneficiary of the Knolls' philanthropic non-profit organization, the Andrah Foundation.
In December 2007, Summers-Knoll became the first certified Michigan Green School in Ann Arbor.

He compiled a record of 6–3–1 as the head coach at Washington Agricultural.
Early years.
Allen was born in approximately 1877 and was a resident of Sac City, Iowa. He was the son of William Allen (born c. 1816 in Virginia) and Sarah Allen (born c. 1847 in Wisconsin). At the time of the 1880 United States Census and the 1885 Iowa Census, the family was living at Sac City.
Allen began his education at the University of Notre Dame. In 1897, he enrolled at the University of Michigan as student in the Department of Laws. As a first-year student in 1897, Allen was the vice president of his class and the captain of the varsity reserve football team.

The 1902 Washington Agricultural yearbook, the "Chinook", noted: "The football teams during the season just past have, for the first time in the history of athletics at the W. A. C., had the assistance of a coach. W. L. Allen, a graduate of the University of Michigan, was procured by the Athletic Association to coach the men; he was very successful and has built a strong foundation for our future in football." He returned to coach the team in 1902 and compiled an overall record of 6–3–1.
Later years.
By 1902, Allen had moved to Seattle, Washington. He died in May 1907 at Las Vegas, New Mexico, and was buried at Cherokee, Iowa.

Evelyn Eaton

Evelyn Sybil Mary Eaton (22 December 1902 – 17 July 1983) was a Canadian novelist, short-story writer, poet and academic known for her early novels set in New France, and later writings which explored the spirituality of the western Amerindian peoples.
Life account.
Born in Montreux, Switzerland, Eaton was the daughter of Canadians Daniel Isaac Vernon Eaton, an army officer from Nova Scotia, and Myra Fitzrandolph of New Brunswick. Eaton was the younger of two daughters. Her father was killed in 1917, while directing the artillery assault at the battle of Vimy Ridge in France.
Educated at the Netherwood School in Rothesay, New Brunswick, Heathfield School in Ascot, England, and at the Sorbonne in Paris, Eaton rejected many of the social conventions of her time and class, giving birth out of wedlock to a daughter while at the Sorbonne. She wrote poetry from an early age, publishing the first, 'The Interpreter', in 1923. Two novels written in 1938 and 1939 received little notice, but in 1940, the publication of 'Quietly My Captain Waits', a novel set in Acadia (now Nova Scotia) in the early days of French settlement (New France), brought her commercial success. She became an American citizen in 1945. A series of novels set in New France followed, as did a teaching appointment at Columbia University from 1949–1951, a Visiting Lecturership at Sweet Briar College, Virginia from 1951–1960, and a position as Writer in Residence with the Huntingdon Hartford Foundation in 1960 and 1962.
As described in 1974 autobiography, 'The Trees and Fields Went the Other Way' Eaton had always felt that she had some Native American or Amerindian heritage, and in the 1950s she began to explore Native American spirituality. A series of short stories published in the New Yorker, four more novels, a volume of poetry, and a Ballet-oratorio would grow out of Eaton's continuing adoption of Native American spiritual practices.
In 1966, the Evelyn Sybil Mary Eaton Collection, a repository for her books, manuscripts, and personal papers, was established in the Mugar Memorial Library at Boston University.

Jump (magazine line)

History.
In 1949, Shueisha got into the business of making manga magazines the first being "Omoshiro Book". In 1951, Shueisha created a female version of that anthology entitled "Shōjo Book". "Shōjo Book" led to the publication of the highly successful Shōjo manga magazine: "Ribon". "Omoshiro Book" went out of print and Shueisha decided to make another male version of their successful "Shōjo Book" to even it out and made the magazine "Shōnen Book". In the middle of "Shōnen Book's" publication, "Shōnen Jump" began its run (at the time was a Semiweekly magazine and had no "Weekly"). "Shōnen Book" ended when "Shōnen Jump" became a Weekly magazine correctly changing its name to "Weekly Shōnen Jump". In 1969 a special issue called "Bessatsu Shōnen Jump" took "Shōnen Book's" place. In addition to the success of "Weekly Shōnen Jump", Shueisha created a Seinen version of the magazine in 1979, called "Young Jump" (now "Weekly Young Jump"). "Bessatsu Shōnen Jump", later got renamed "Monthly Shōnen Jump" and became a magazine of its own. The seasonal issues of "Weekly Shōnen Jump" are now called "Akamaru Jump". In 1985, Shueisha started the publication of two business related manga magazines; a salaryman "Jump" magazine called "Business Jump" and an office lady manga magazine called "Office You", also in 1988 started the publication of "Super Jump". Many other Seinen related "Jump" magazines, started as spin-off issues of the "Weekly Young Jump" magazine. In 1993, Shueisha announced and released the video game/manga magazine "V Jump" alongside the Jump light novel line "Jump j-Books". In 2003 Shogakukan's Viz Media released an English version of "Weekly Shōnen Jump" called "Shonen Jump". "Monthly Shōnen Jump" discontinued in 2007 and was replaced with the "Jump SQ." magazine, four series from the magazine were moved. In addition to the "Jump SQ." anthology, a spin-off issue was created, called "Jump SQ.II (Second)".

Everett Sweeley

Everett Marlin Sweeley (March 4, 1880 – September 2, 1957) was an American football player and coach. He played fullback, halfback and end for the University of Michigan from 1899 to 1902 and was a member of Fielding H. Yost's 1901 and 1902 "Point-a-Minute" teams. He then served as the head football coach at Morningside College in 1903 and at Washington State University in 1904 and 1905. He also coached basketball and baseball at Washington State. After retiring from football, Sweeley became a lawyer and judge in Idaho.
Biography.
Early years.
Sweeley was born in Adel, Iowa in 1880. At the time of the 1885 Iowa State Census, Sweeley was living in Storm Lake, Iowa. He attended high school at Sioux City, Iowa.
University of Michigan.
Sweeley enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1899. He played four years of football at Michigan from 1899–1902 at the end, fullback, and halfback positions, but he was best known as one of the game's premier punters and placekickers.
Before enrolling at Michigan, Sweeley said he had never seen a college football game. In four seasons, he missed only one game, the result of what Sweeley called "a little row with a math professor."
While playing for Michigan, Sweeley set the college football record for the longest kick on record. In 1902, he kicked the football 86 yards before touching the ground. Sweeley also held "an enviable distinction unboasted by any other hero of the gridiron." In four years punting for Michigan, he never had a single punt blocked. Sweeley was known for punts that were both high and long. He would reportedly tell his ends accurately where each punt was to go, "and by this concerted action Michigan gained many yards." Sweeley was also "an expert place kicker," scoring over 100 points for Michigan in this manner. A 1906 newspaper feature reported that his greatest talent was "the running punt trick," a play in which Sweeley would run a ball "until he was hard pressed and then kick, often thus adding many yards to the ground gained."
In the 1902 Rose Bowl, Sweeley kicked four field goals and punted 21 times for a 38.9-yard average. A newspaper story in 1950 reported on Sweeley's kicking ability: "Sweeley, a truly great kicker in the days when the ball resembled a pumpkin rather than the tapered oblate spheroid now in use, introduced the spiral pant to Coast fans that memorable day the 1902 Rose Bowl. His towering punts outdistanced the end-over-end kicks of the Indians by 20 yards."
Coach.
After graduating from Michigan, Sweeley went into coaching. He served as the head football coach at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa for a season in 1903 and then moved to Washington State University in Pullman, Washington for the 1904 and 1905 seasons. His coaching record at Washington State was 6 wins, 6 losses, and 0 ties.
Later years.
After retiring from coaching, Sweeley moved to Twin Falls, Idaho where he worked as a lawyer. In September 1907, he married Hazel Jury Brown (1886–1972) at Spokane, Washington. According to the 1920 United States Census, Sweeley and his wife had two children at that time, Jean B Sweeley (age 9) and Anna L. Sweeley (age 6).
Sweeley also became an expert trap shooter and ballistics expert. In 1916, he won the interstate trapshooting championship. He was elected prosecutor in 1938. 
In his draft registration card signed in April 1942, Sweeley listed his residence as Twin Falls, his employer as the County of Twin Falls, and his place of employment as the County Courthouse in Twin Falls.
In 1952, Sweeley attended a reunion in California of the 1902 Rose Bowl team. At the time, Sweeley was a practicing attorney living in Twin Falls, and was recalled as "a great punter back at the turn of the century." He served as a probate judge in the mid-1950s.

Walter Rheinschild

Walter Meadowfield Rheinschild (September 26, 1884 – October 3, 1960), known also by the nicknames "Rheiny" and "Rhino", was an American football player and coach. He played for the University of Michigan in 1904, 1905, and 1907, and was once "rated as the highest salaried amateur athlete in the business." He later coached for Washington State University in 1908, St. Vincent College (now known as Loyola Marymount University) in 1909, Throop College (now known as California Institute of Technology) in 1913, and Occidental College in 1917.
Biography.
Early years.
Rheinschild was born in Lawrence, Kansas in 1884 and raised in Los Angeles, California. In the 1890s, Rheinschild began playing football for the Boyle Heights Stars in the Boyle Heights section of Los Angeles. With Rheinschild playing fullback, the Stars won what the "Los Angeles Times" called "the 'scrub' championship of this city." 
In 1900, Rheinschild enrolled at Los Angeles High School, where he became "a gridiron hero." In 1901, he played tackle for the Los Angeles High School football team that tied Belmont High School for the state championship and defeated several college teams, including the University of Southern California (28–0), Pomona College (30–0), Occidental College (32–0), and St. Vincent College (95–0). In 1902, the powerful Los Angeles High School team again defeated college teams, including USC, Occidental, Pomona and Throop College (now known as California Institute of Technology). In his senior year in 1903, Rheinschild led Los Angeles High School to the California state championship, culminating in an 11-0 victory over Berkeley High School in the championship game.
Rheinschild also organized the first track team at Los Angeles High School and was elected as the first captain of the track team.
Bidding for Rheinschild's services.
Rheinschild was one of the most heavily recruited high school football players in the United States in 1904. USC coach Harvey Holmes recruited him strenuously, and Rheinschild later said that Holmes had offered him $75 a month for his services. At the time, USC was not a major football program, and Rheinschild reportedly wanted "nothing but the big league stuff." The University of Wisconsin made an offer to Rheinschild which he said was $25 higher than USC had offered. Rheinschild recalled, "Twelve hundred looked big to me, but I wanted a winner. Wisconsin had been a joke for many seasons and I couldn't see it." A former coach at Los Angeles High School, Shorty Roach, was a friend of Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost and a Michigan scout on the side. Roach encouraged Rheinschild to consider Michigan, which had not lost a game since 1900. A Wisconsin newspaper described the bidding contest between the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan for his services:"Walter Rheinschild, one of the best academic foot ball players in Southern California, is the object of spirited bidding by foot ball managers at Wisconsin and Michigan universities. Rheinschild was a star tackle on last year's local high school team. He weighs 190 pounds. He declares openly that Manager Baird of Michigan offered to pay all his expenses during the season and finally offered him remunerative employment. Wisconsin, he says, offered him all traveling expenses and $60 a month for two hours work a day at the state capital. Rheinschild leaves tomorrow for the east. If Michigan equals Wisconsin's offer he will go to Ann Arbor, if not, to Madison. At Kansas City he expects to receive Baird's highest offer."
Rheinschild was also visited by "a delegation" from Dartmouth College seeking "to do business with the California lad." Rheinschild later told the "Los Angeles Times" that Dartmouth had offered him $2,200 for a year's work on the football team. Rheinschild settled on Fielding Yost's team at Michigan and later told the "Times" that "he swears by all that is swearable that he never received a cent from his Alma Mater for his athletic contributions." Michigan's athletic director Charles A. Baird also denied making any offers of financial assistance to Rheinschild. However, when he rejected Dartmouth's offer of $2,200, eastern newspapers insinuated that Rheinschild had signed for "a Ty Cobb salary at Ann Arbor." It was rumored that Rheinschild was receiving as much as $50,000 a year at Michigan, which if true would be as much as the U.S. President at the time.
In a feature story on Rheinschild, the "Los Angeles Times" in 1914 summed up the bidding war for Rheinschild this way:"He used to be the great 'Rhiney,' and was known from coast to coast as one of the most eminent gridiron warriors ever enticed under the Michigan colors. At one time, 'Rhiney' was rated as the highest salaried amateur athlete in the business, and he had standing offers from a number of those colleges where football reigns, of sweet sums for his services."
University of Michigan.
Rheinschild enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1904 and played for Fielding H. Yost's Michigan Wolverines football teams of 1904, 1905, and 1907. Rheinschild also threw the shot put for the Michigan Wolverines men's track and field team alongside world record holder Ralph Rose, and played catcher on the Michigan Wolverines baseball team.
When Rheinschild established himself as a starter for Michigan in 1905, the "Los Angeles Herald" reported on his success as follows:"Walter Reinschild, formerly a star player of the Los Angeles high school football team, is making good with the University of Michigan squad this year. He played right tackle in the game against Vanderbilt university last Saturday and made consistent gains when given the ball. According to reports of the game Reinschild hit the opposing line low and hard and his work was a factor in winning a decisive victory for 'Hurry Up' Yost's team. It looks as though Reinschild would be a fixture on the team."
In late 1905 and early 1906, charges of professionalism were leveled at the major college football programs, including Michigan, leading to calls for reform or even elimination of the sport from college campuses. In response to the controversy, the faculty at Michigan ruled Rheinschild and two other football players, Germany Schulz and Henry Schulte, academically ineligible. As a result, Rheinschild missed the 1906 season. Rheinschild's hometown newspaper, the "Los Angeles Times" described the action as follows: "In 1906 a wave of athletic purity swept over the country and the faculty refused to allow Rheinschild to play, for appearance sake. ... 'Rhiney' assisted Yost with the coaching and did some classroom work for a change."
Rheinschild returned to the football team in 1907. Playing at tackle and occasionally at fullback, he scored three touchdowns in Michigan's victory over Michigan Agricultural College (now known as Michigan State University) in October 1907. He also scored touchdowns against Wabash College and Ohio State in 1907. At the end of the 1907 season, Rheinschild was one of two Michigan players selected by Fielding H. Yost for the All-American team he selected for the North American Press Syndicate. He was also selected as an All-Western tackle by Walter Eckersall, who wrote that Rheinschild "has no equal at tackle." Eckersall continued:"Rheinschild of Michigan played close to the top this year, and his work in the Pennsylvania game would have given him even without his work in the other games. It was the best of any tackle on the field, and clearly indicated his caliber. One of his points is getting down the field under kicks. He often beat his ends down, and was sure and deadly in his tackle. He was not made use of sufficiently in offense to get his value in that respect. He was able to lunge from his position with extreme rapidity, to assist either the offense or defense. His play was, if anything less showy than in former years, but fully as effective, and this was clearly demonstrated all year."
Rheinschild graduated from the University of Michigan in 1908 with a law degree.
Coaching career.
After receiving his law degree, Rheinschild went to London where he competed for the Illinois Athletic Club in the 1908 Summer Olympics. After the Olympics, Rheinschild traveled to Paris, where he claimed to have "taught the 'frog-eaters' how to box for a few months." Upon returning to the United States, he got a job "escorting a flock of prisoners across the continent to Mare Island" in Northern California. 
In the fall of 1908, Rheinschild served as head football coach for the Washington State University Cougars in Pullman, Washington. In his first and only season as coach at Washington State, his football team compiled a record of 4 wins, 0 losses, and 2 ties.
In 1909, Rheinschild returned to Los Angeles to become head football coach at St. Vincent College (now known as Loyola Marymount University). He led St. Vincent's to an undefeated season and the football championship of Southern California in his one year as head coach. The "Los Angeles Times" praised Rheinschild's efforts in turning the St. Vincent team into champions:"Rheinschild has accomplished wonders with a squad which at the outset of the season appeared to be mediocre to an unusual degree. The Saints' athletic authorities are more than pleased with the success of 'Rheiny.' They expected the coach to clean up the Saint athletics and get a start for next year. 'Rheiny' did considerably more. He developed the strongest team the Saints ever had. And the eleven played clean ball too."
In 1910, St. Vincent College withdrew from participation in Southern California intercollegiate athletics, opting to confine athletics to the Catholic student body.
In 1913, Rheinschild was hired as the football coach at Throop College (now known as California Institute of Technology) in Pasadena, California, where he was paid $40 per game—the largest salary ever paid to a football coach in Southern California. He continued coaching in the 1910s as the football coach of the Los Angeles Athletic Club.
In 1915, Rheinschild was offered coaching positions at both the University of Michigan and the University of Washington. In April 1916, Rheinschild was hired as the football coach at Occidental College, replacing Joseph Pipal. Rheinschild coached at Occidental through the 1917 season.
On Christmas Day 1917, Rheinschild coached and played for a college all-star football team in a match against athletes from the San Pedro Submarine Base.
Family, legal and business careers.
Rheinschild was married in February 1909 to Enid Daniels at the Scottish Rite Cathedral in Los Angeles; following the ceremony, they couple was given a box at the Orpheum Theatre where a spot light was thrown on them between acts as "the orchestra struck up a wedding march" for the embarrassed couple.
After stepping down as the coach at St. Vincent College in 1910, Rheinschild established a law practice in the Security Building, then the tallest building in Los Angeles, located in the heart of the city's Spring Street Financial District. He continued with his legal practice between and after his stints as a football coach. 
In April 1919, Rheinschild was tried and found not guilty of complicity in an automobile theft; Rheinschild had been accused of hiding the automobile after it was stolen by another person. In September 1919, Rheinschild was suspended from the practice of law for 18 months after being accused of unethical conduct in representing both parties in a loan transaction. The "Los Angeles Times" reported that "tears of mortification" came into his eyes when the suspension was announced, and "his young and attractive wife ran up to him and threw her arms around his neck and tenderly kissed him." Two weeks later, the same judge reversed the suspension. The following month, a different judge ordered Rheinschild disbarred, stating that the action was needed to set an example for other lawyers to restrain from similar conflicts of interest.
As of 1934, Rheinschild was the president of Corona Oil Company, Ltd., which was then drilling for oil in "the old Rancho LaSierra" in Riverside County, California.
In 1942, Rheinschild was a prosecution witness against Bugsy Siegel on charges of murdering Harry "Big Greenie" Greenberg; Rheinschild testified he had seen Siegel near Greenberg's house on many occasions in the weeks prior to the murder.

<doc id="20397298" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20397298" title="Analytic dissection">
Analytic dissection

Analytic dissection is a concept in U.S. copyright law analysis of computer software. Analytic dissection is a tool for determining whether a work accused of copyright infringement is substantially similar to a copyright-protected work. 
In analytic dissection, unprotectable elements of a work are dissected out and discarded before making any comparison of the two works. These unprotectable components include "idea" (as contrasted with "expression"), "scènes à faire" (conventional elements typical of a genre), material in the public domain, and functional aspects. As the Ninth Circuit explained in the 1988 "Data East" case, that such elements are common to two works does not create substantial similarity. Rather, infringing similarity must be based on the similarity of what remains after the unprotectable elements are dissected out.
Subsequently, in "Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.", the Second Circuit applied this conceptual tool in determining whether two computer programs were substantially similar, under the name of the "Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison" test. As the Tenth Circuit concisely explained this test in its "Gates Rubber v. Bando Chemical Industries" opinion:
This legal test has generally "been applied in subsequent law decisions, to the extent that it is recognised in the USA, and elsewhere, as the accepted standard."
Parallels in patent law.
A conceptually similar approach has been applied at times in US, UK, and European patent law. In "Neilson v. Harford", the Exchequer adopted a method of analyzing the patent-eligibility of inventions based on a natural principle or phenomenon of nature, in which the principle is treated as if part of the prior art and the remainder of the invention (i.e., the mechanical implementation of the principle) is evaluated for patentability under the usual tests (novelty, etc.). The US Supreme Court followed this approach in "O’Reilly v. Morse" and subsequent decisions including "Parker v. Flook". A similar type of analysis of obviousness or inventive level has been used under the name of the "point of novelty" test, which is suggested by the use of a Jepson claim.

Blackpool.
Martin made his debut for Joe Smith's Blackpool in the penultimate league game of the 1957–58 season, in a single-goal defeat by Everton at Bloomfield Road on 23 April. He also appeared in the final league game three days later, another defeat, this time at Tottenham Hotspur.
Joe Smith retired after 23 years as Blackpool manager at the end of 1957–58. His successor for the 1958–59 campaign was former '"Pool" player Ron Suart. Suart gave six league starts to Martin.
It was Martin's third season at Blackpool, 1959–60, that he properly broke into the team. He made 38 league appearances, missing only four games. He also scored his first goal for the club, in a 3–1 victory over Chelsea at Bloomfield Road on 12 December.
In 1960–61, Martin was ever-present in Blackpool's first twelve games of the league campaign, but he went on to miss the next 22. He returned to the line-up on 31 March, with eight games remaining, of which he appeared in six.
Conversely, Martin missed only one league game of the 1961–62 campaign (and one of Blackpool's 52 total games, which included a run to the semi-finals of the League Cup).
He went one better in 1962–63, appearing in all of the club's 47 league and cup games.
Martin chalked up another forty league appearances in 1963–64, his final season at the seaside. His swan song was in the final game of the league campaign, a 4–3 defeat at Ipswich Town on 25 April.

Santi Vito, Modesto e Crescenzia

Santi Vito, Modesto e Crescenzia (Saints Vito, Modesto and Crescenzia) is the name of a Catholic church in Rome, officially named Santi Vito e Modesto. It is located in the Rione Esquilino, adjacent to the Servian Wall. It is near the Oratory of Santa Maria Immacolata della Concezione. Its facade is on Via Carlo Alberto, with the entrance on the Via San Vito.
History.
The church was first recorded in the "Liber Pontificalis" for the reign of Pope Leo III (795-816). The original name was San Vito "in Macello Martyrum" or "in the marketplace of the martyrs". A "macellum" was an ancient Roman indoor market, and the ancient "Macellum Liviae" may have been the one referred to. It is adjacent to the ancient Servian Wall, and the Arch of Gallienus, which was a major passageway within the city.
The original dedication was to St. Vitus, a 4th-century martyr in Sicily. He became very popular during the Middle Ages as the patron saint of those suffering from epilepsy, and was venerated as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. In England and other countries his name was mutated into "Guy" (as in Guy Fawkes), which in Italian became Guido.
The church was described as a "diaconia", a center for the Church's charitable activities and received donations from Pope Leo. This implies that it was founded when there was still a local residential population to be served from the time of its founding, likely in the 6th century, as the Esquiline began to lose its population about that time. Possibly in line with its ancient orientation, it became a titular church for a Cardinal Deacon in 1088. The first cardinal to receive this title was Leo of Ostia, a Benedictine monk.
In that same period an unhistorical legend describing the martyrdom of St. Vitus became popular. This legend associated him with two other martyrs called Modestus and Crescentia who were identified as a married couple, his childhood tutor and nursemaid. As a result, the church was renamed San Vitale e Modesto "in Macello Martyrum", which was also the name of the cardinalate. Later in the Middle Ages the cardinalate was renamed Santi Vitale, Modesto e Crescentia, but the church came to be called simply Santi Vito e Modesto, as the "Macello Martyrum" was forgotten.
By the 15th century the church had fallen into ruins. It was rebuilt by 1474 by Pope Sixtus IV in a different location, presumed to be near the original site. At that time it was entrusted to the Cistercian monks. They established a small monastery adjacent to the church, which served as the residence of the Procurator General of the Order.
According to "Mas Latrie", this deaconry became a title from 1477 until 1480, when it was returned to its older rank as a Cardinal-Deaconry. and again in 1565 when Pope Pius IV (1559-1565) created 23 new cardinals. It underwent a series of reconstructions in the following centuries. Pope Sixtus V listed it among the deaconries in his apostolic constitution "Religiosa".
The interior has frescoes of the Madonna, child, and Saints attribuito ad Antoniazzo Romano. It also has 19th-century frescoes depicting the "Madonna offering the Rosary to Saints Dominic and Catherine of Siena".
The current Cardinal Deacon is Giuseppe Bertello, appointed in 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI.

John Isaac Hawkins

John Isaac Hawkins (1772–1855) was an inventor who practiced civil engineering.
He was known as the co-inventor of the ever-pointed pencil, an early mechanical pencil, and of the upright piano.
Early life.
Hawkins was born 14 March 1772 at Taunton, Somerset, England, the son of Joan Wilmington and her husband Rev. Isaac Hawkins, a watchmaker. Isaac Hawkins became first a Wesleyan minister, but was expelled by John Wesley; and after moving the family to Moorfields in London was a minister in the Swedenborgian movement, which John Isaac would also follow. John Isaac emigrated to the United States about 1790, attending the College of New Jersey, where he studied medicine and later, chemical filtration.
Hawkins married in New Jersey, and was living at Bordentown and Philadelphia. In his own account, he was influenced by work of Georg Moritz Lowitz to try charcoal for filtration purposes, and ran an exhibition on the topic, with Raphaelle and Rembrandt Peale, in the Philadelphia Exchange Coffee House. He operated a non-vocational craft school in Bristol, Pennsylvania from about 1800; and he collaborated on inventions with Rev. Burgess Allison.
In London.
Hawkins returned to England in 1803, and opened a London sugar refinery. He also worked as a patent agent and consultant at this period. He set up a museum of "useful mechanical inventions", featuring a number of his own, as reported in the "Monthly Magazine" in 1808. He also continued inventing and performed "experiments of a delightfully awful character". As a Swedenborgian, he associated with Manoah Sibly, becoming secretary of the "London Conference" in 1814 when Sibly was president. He took an interest in phrenology from 1815, for the rest of his life. Hawkins and his wife adopted from the workhouse a child, James Chalmers, orphaned after his parents had entered the Poyais project of Gregor MacGregor; he died young.
Hawkins joined the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1824. In 1825, he went to Vienna to superintend the construction of a beet sugar works there, and subsequently did the same in Paris. Back in London, where his wife Anna died in 1838, he superintended the construction of the Thames Tunnel under Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Hawkins also served as president of the Anthropological Society of London, a phrenological group.
Later life.
Later in life Hawkins fell into debt and concluding that America presented a better opportunity to profit from his patents, he decided to re-emigrate, departing in autumn 1848. Returning to New Jersey, "as a grey old man" he lived with his third wife "who was barely out of her teens". Lectures there for local ladies could not survive their disapproval of his display of human skulls or the preserved organs of his deceased adopted son, his only child, whom he had dissected following the boy's death at age seven. He published the "Journal of Human Nature and Human Progress", but this was short-lived, and he died in poverty and relative obscurity at Rahway or Elizabethtown, New Jersey, 28 June 1855.
Pianino.
Hawkins was the first to see the importance of using iron in pianoforte framing. He was living in Philadelphia when he invented and first produced the
pianino or cottage pianoforte — the “portable grand” as he then called it — which he patented in 1800. Thomas Jefferson bought one, of 5½ octaves, for $264.
There had been upright grand pianos as well as upright harpsichords, the horizontal instrument being turned up on its wider end and a keyboard and action adapted to it. William Southwell, an Irish piano-maker, had in 1798 tried a similar experiment with a square piano, to be repeated in later years by William Frederick Collard of London; but Hawkins was the first to make a piano, or pianino, with the strings descending to the floor, the keyboard being raised. His instrument was in a complete iron frame, independent of the case; and in this frame, strengthened by a system of iron resistance rods combined with an iron upper bridge, his sound-board was entirely suspended. An apparatus for tuning by mechanical screws regulated the tension of the strings, which were of equal length throughout. The action, in metal supports, anticipated Robert Wornum's in the checking, and later ideas in a contrivance for repetition. This bundle of inventions was brought to London and exhibited by Hawkins himself; but the instrument was poor in tone.

N of 1 trial

An N of 1 trial is a clinical trial in which a single patient is the entire trial, a single case study. A trial in which random allocation can be used to determine the order in which an experimental and a control intervention are given to a patient is an N of 1 randomized controlled trial. The order of experimental and control interventions can also be fixed by the researcher.
This type of study has enabled practitioners to achieve experimental progress without the overwhelming work of designing a group comparison study. It can be very effective in confirming causality. This can be achieved in many ways. One of the most common procedures is the ABA withdrawal experimental design, where the patient problem is measured before a treatment is introduced (baseline) and then measured again during the treatment and finally when the treatment has terminated. If the problem vanished during the treatment it can be established that the treatment was effective. A variation of experimental design in single case studies is great. But the N=1 study can also be executed in an AB quasi experimental way; this means that causality cannot be definitively demonstrated. Another variation is non-concurrent experimental design where different points in time are compared with one another. This experimental design also has a problem with causality. But the replication of studies has a great value and can be as effective as a group study. The single case experimental design has been very effective in psychology and other field of behavior science.

Staropolskie Voivodeship

Old Poland Voivodeship (Polish: "Wojewodztwo staropolskie") was a proposed Voivodeship of Poland, which, however has not been created. It was to cover the area of northern part of the historical province of Lesser Poland, with such cities as Częstochowa, Kielce and Sandomierz (first draft also included Radom). 
First talks.
First talks about creation of the new voivodeship took place on February 13, 1998 in the village of "Zloty Potok". Participants were local politicians from three voivodeships - Radomskie, Kieleckie and Czestochowskie. All knew that according to the "1998 Local Government Reorganization Act", territorial organization of Poland would significantly change, with the removal of most of the voivodeships, and therefore they decided to act.
A week later, on February 20, 1998, another meeting took place. This time, there were no representatives from Radom, they were replaced by politicians from western part of the Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship, together with the city of Sandomierz (but without the cities of Tarnobrzeg and Stalowa Wola), who expressed their desire to join the proposed province.
Włoszczowa Agreement.
On July 4, 1998 in Włoszczowa, politicians from Kielce, Częstochowa and Sandomierz signed the so-called Włoszczowa Agreement. It included a joint statement, which backed creation of the Old Poland Voivodeship, with the seat of a Voivode located in Częstochowa and seat of the local parliament in Kielce. The text of the agreement was handed to the central authorities of Poland on July 8.
However, the initiative failed, as the Local Government Reorganization Act created the Swietokrzyskie Voivodeship, which did not include the area of Częstochowa, as it became part of the Silesian Voivodeship. 
Size and population.
According to the Włoszczowa Agreement, the proposed Voivodeship would cover the area of 17 006 km2. Its population (as for 2006) would be 1 995 000, with 48.8% living in urban areas. It would be made out of two urban counties (cities of Częstochowa and Kielce), and eighteen land counties. These were:

Return to Mysterious Island 2

"Return to Mysterious Island 2: Mina's Fate" is a 2009 adventure video game by Kheops Studio and Microïds. It is a sequel to the 2004 video game "Return to Mysterious Island", and is again based upon the work of Jules Verne, "The Mysterious Island".
Gameplay.
The character of Mina is back, but now her monkey, Jep, becomes the second playable character; the player will switch back and forth between the two. Each character has their own abilities—Jep, for example, can go to inaccessible places and communicate with other monkeys, whereas Mina can read documents and use complex tools.
The game could also be synchronised with the player's iPhone, allowing parts of the game, like puzzles, to be completed away from the PC, and then reintegrated again. Players are also be able to communicate with other players online.
Plot.
During the game the player will fight for their survival on the island, and they must also save the island from an environmental disaster. "Return to Mysterious Island II" starts with the crash of the helicopter that attempted the rescue of Mina. She survives the crash, but is still on the island. An unknown disease suddenly begins to attack plants, then animals. Mina searches the island, and discovers an external source of pollution. It appears that the only way to save the island is to turn the shield back on, which would prevent her from returning to civilization, like Captain Nemo.
Development.
On November 25, 2008 Microïds announced that a sequel to "Return to Mysterious Island" had been in development by Kheops Studio since April 2008. On 14 August an email was sent to the Microïds mailing list noting that the game had been released for download in English and French for PC and iPhone.
The game website also displays the Cryo Interactive logo, a company which Microïds acquired in 2008, from the publisher of the original "Return to Mysterious Island", The Adventure Company. The game website also encompasses Microïds other games which are based on the works of Jules Verne; "The Secret of the Nautilus" and "Journey to the Moon".

Nick Griffin

Nicholas John "Nick" Griffin (born 1 March 1959) is a British politician, chairman of the British National Party (BNP) and Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for North West England.
Born in Barnet, Griffin was educated at Woodbridge School in Suffolk. He joined the National Front at the age of fourteen and, following his graduation from the University of Cambridge, became a political worker for the party. In 1980 he became a member of its governing body, and later wrote articles for several right-wing magazines. He was the National Front's candidate for the seat of Croydon North West in 1981 and 1983, but left the party in 1989. In 1995 he joined the BNP and in 1999, became its leader. He stood as the party's candidate in several elections and was elected as a member of the European Parliament for North West England in the 2009 European Elections.
In 1998, Griffin was convicted of distributing material likely to incite racial hatred, for which he received a suspended prison sentence. In 2006, he was acquitted of separate charges of inciting racial hatred. Griffin has been criticised for many of his comments on political, social, ethical and religious matters, though since becoming leader of the BNP he has sought to distance himself from some of his previously-held positions, which include Holocaust denial. In recent years, where Griffin has been invited to participate in public debates or political discussions, the events have proven controversial, and have often resulted in protests and cancellations.
Early life and education.
The son of former Conservative councillor Edgar Griffin and his wife Jean, Nicholas John Griffin was born on 1 March 1959 in Barnet and moved to Southwold in Suffolk aged eight. He was educated at Woodbridge School before winning a sixth–form scholarship to the independent Saint Felix School in Southwold, one of only two boys in the all-girls school.
Griffin read "Mein Kampf" when he was fourteen, and "found all but one chapter extremely boring." He joined the National Front in 1974, while he was still fourteen, though he had to pretend he was fifteen, and at the age of sixteen is reported to have stayed at the home of National Front organiser Martin Webster. In a four-page leaflet written in 1999, Webster claimed to have had a homosexual relationship with Griffin, then the BNP's publicity director. Griffin has denied any such relationship.
In 1977, Griffin went to Downing College, Cambridge, where he studied history, then law. His affiliation with the National Front was revealed during a Cambridge Union debate, and his photograph was published in a student newspaper. He later founded the Young National Front Student organisation. He graduated with a second-class honours degree in law (2:2), and a boxing blue, having taken up the sport following a brawl in Lewisham with a member of an anti-fascist party. He boxed three times against Oxford in the annual Varsity match, winning twice and losing once. In an interview with "The Independent", he said he gave it up because of a hand injury. He is a fan of Ricky Hatton and Joe Calzaghe, and an admirer of Amir Khan.
Political career.
1970s–1990.
Following his graduation, Griffin became a political worker at the National Front headquarters. As a teenager he had accompanied his father to a National Front meeting, and by 1978, he was a national organiser for the party. He helped set up the White Noise Music Club in 1979, and several years later worked with white power skinhead band, Skrewdriver. In 1980, he became a member of the party's governing body, the National Directorate, and in the same year launched "Nationalism Today" with the aid of Joe Pearce, then editor of the NF youth paper "Bulldog". As a National Front member, Griffin contested the seat of Croydon North West twice, in the 1981 by-election and 1983 general election, securing 1.2% and 0.9% of the vote.
Membership of the National Front declined significantly following the election of the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher. As a result the party became more radicalised, and a dissatisfied Griffin, along with fellow NF activists Derek Holland and Patrick Harrington, began to embrace the ideals of Italian fascist Roberto Fiore (Fiore had arrived in the UK in 1980). By 1983, the group had broken away to form the NF Political Soldier faction, which advocated a revival of country "values" and a return to feudalism with the establishment of nationalist communes. Writing for "Bulldog" in 1985, Griffin praised the black separatist Louis Farrakhan, but his comments were unpopular with some members of the party. He also attempted to form alliances with Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini, and praised the efforts of Welsh nationalist movement Meibion Glyndŵr.
Following a disagreement with Harrington (who subsequently formed the Third Way), and objections over the direction the party was headed, in 1989, Griffin left the National Front. Along with Holland and Fiore, he helped form the International Third Position (ITP), a development of the Political Soldier movement, but left the organisation in 1990. In the same year, he lost his left eye when a discarded shotgun cartridge exploded in a pile of burning wood, since when he has worn a glass eye. The accident left him unable to work, and owing to other financial problems he subsequently petitioned for bankruptcy (the accident occurred in France, where he later lost money in a failed business project). For several years thereafter, he abstained from politics and was supported financially by his parents. He later stewarded a public Holocaust denial meeting hosted by David Irving.
1993–1999.
Griffin re-entered politics in 1993 and, in 1995, at the behest of John Tyndall, joined the British National Party. He also became editor of two right-wing magazines owned by Tyndall, "Spearhead" and "The Rune". Referring to the election of the BNP's first councillor at a 1993 council by-election in Millwall, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, he wrote:
Tyndall founded the BNP in 1982, but his "brutal, streetfighting background" and admiration for Hitler and the Nazis had prevented his cause from acquiring any political respectability. In his 1999 leadership campaign, Griffin embarked on a strategy to make the party electable, by taking it away from Tyndall's extremist image. He was helped by Tyndall's lack of familiarity with the mainstream media, and in the party's September election he defeated Tyndall to become head of the BNP. One of Griffin's changes included moderating the party's emphasis on the removal of multiculturalism, a policy it claims has a destructive influence on both immigrant and British cultures. This realignment was designed to position the BNP alongside successful European far-right groups, such as the French "Front National". Street protests were replaced by electoral campaigning, and some policies were moderated (the compulsory repatriation of ethnic minorities was instead made voluntary). Other policies included the introduction of capital punishment for paedophiles, rapists, drug dealers and some murderers, and corporal punishment for less serious crimes such as juvenile delinquency. Griffin's image as a Cambridge-educated family man was in contrast to the extremist image presented by the BNP under Tyndall's leadership.
2000–present.
In addition to his earlier candidacies for the National Front, Griffin has stood as the BNP candidate in several English elections. In 2000, he stood in West Bromwich West, in a by-election triggered by the resignation of Betty Boothroyd. He came fourth, with 794 votes (4.21% of those cast). Following the Oldham race riots he ran in Oldham West and Royton in the 2001 general election. He received 6,552 votes (16% of those cast), beating the Liberal Democrats for third place, closely behind the second place Conservatives, who received 7,076 votes. He again stood for election in the 2003 Oldham Council election, for a seat representing the Chadderton North ward. He came second to the Labour candidate, receiving 993 votes (28% of those cast). In the 2004 European Parliament election, when he was the BNP candidate for the North West England constituency, the party received 134,959 votes (6.4% of those cast), but won no seats. In the 2005 general election he contested Keighley in West Yorkshire, and polled 4,240 votes (9.2% of those cast), finishing in fourth place.
Griffin was the BNP candidate in the 2007 Welsh National Assembly Elections, in the South Wales West region. The BNP received 8,993 votes (5.5% of those cast), behind the Labour party's 58,347 votes (35.8%). In October 2007, he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Thurrock Council election. In November 2008, the entire membership list of the BNP was posted on the Internet (however the list may have included lapsed members of the party and people who had expressed an interest in joining the party, but had not signed up). Griffin claimed that he knew the identity of the individual responsible, describing him as a hard-line senior employee who had left the party in the previous year. He welcomed the publicity that the story generated, using it to describe the common perception of the average BNP member as a "skinhead oik" as untrue.
He was elected as a member of the European Parliament for North West England in the 2009 European Elections. The BNP polled 943,598 votes (6.2% of those cast), gaining 2 MEPs. Griffin and fellow MEP Andrew Brons were subsequently pelted with eggs as they attempted to stage a celebratory press conference outside the Houses of Parliament. A second venue — a public house near Manchester — was chosen the following day. A line of police blocked a large group of protesters, who chanted "No platform for Nazi Nick" and "Nazi scum off our streets". Griffin viewed the election as an important victory, claiming that his party had been demonised and blocked from holding public meetings. "In Oldham alone there have been hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on employing bogus community workers to keep us out. To triumph against that level of pressure as a political party has never been done before."
In May 2009, he was invited by the BNP representative on the London Assembly, Richard Barnbrook, to accompany him to a Buckingham Palace garden party hosted by Queen Elizabeth II. The invitation prompted objections from several organisations and public figures, including the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, and the anti-fascist organisation Searchlight. Griffin declined this first invitation, but when invited personally in 2010 he accepted:
The Palace later decided to deny Griffin entry to the event, claiming that he had used his invitation "for party political purpose through the media", and citing security concerns. Griffin claimed the decision was an "absolute scandal", and appeared to be "a rule invented for me."
In September 2009, he appealed to party activists for £150,000 of extra funding for the BNP. In the letter, he said that the party's ailing fortunes were a direct result of "attacks on the party". He also defended questions by the Electoral Commission about the transparency of BNP funding. In November 2009, Griffin was a witness at the trial of an Asian man, Tauriq Khalid, at Preston Crown Court. The prosecution claimed that in November 2008 Khalid repeatedly drove past a demonstration that Griffin was attending, and on the second occasion shouted "white bastards". Khalid admitted shouting derisory comments at Griffin and other demonstrators, telling the jury he shouted "Nick Griffin, you fucking wanker" and "Get the fuck out of Burnley, you're not welcome here", but denied shouting "white bastard". Griffin gave evidence against Khalid, and affirmed that Khalid had shouted "white bastard" at him. Griffin said the man "leaned out of the car and pointed at me and made a gun and gang gesture", and that he threatened him by shouting "I'm going to ...". Griffin said he had left the demonstration early, fearing for his safety. The 23-year old defendant denied his comments had any racial intent, and was found not guilty. Griffin later commented "I think it's unfortunate and I think it's wrong, but that's the jury's right. They saw all the evidence, I accept their decision. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it."
In the 2010 general election he contested the Barking constituency polling 6,620 votes and finishing in third place.
In 2011 Griffin narrowly survived a leadership challenge. He caused more controversy in 2012 when he implied that civil partnerships would result in children dying.
On 23 May 2010, Griffin announced that by 2013 he would stand down as leader, to focus on his European Parliament election campaign. However, he did not resign in 2013.
Criminal charges.
1998.
In 1998, Griffin was convicted of violating section 19 of the Public Order Act 1986, relating to the offence of 'publishing or distributing racially inflammatory written material' in issue 12 of "The Rune", published in 1996. Griffin's comments in the magazine were reported to the police by Alex Carlile, then the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire. Following a police raid at Griffin's home, he was charged with distributing material likely to incite racial hatred. Fellow BNP member Paul Ballard was also charged, but entered a guilty plea and did not stand trial. Griffin pleaded not guilty, and was tried at Harrow Crown Court. He called French Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson and Nationalist Osiris Akkebala as witnesses, was found guilty and given a nine-month sentence, suspended for two years, and a £2,300 fine. (Ballard was given a six-month sentence, also suspended for two years.)
Griffin claimed that the law under which he was convicted was an unjust law and he therefore had no obligation to follow it. He was secretly recorded by the ITV programme "The Cook Report" in 1997 describing Carlile as "this bloody Jew ... whose only claim is that his grandparents died in the Holocaust".
2004–2006.
On 14 December 2004, Griffin was arrested at his home in Wales, on suspicion of incitement to racial hatred, over remarks he made about Islam in an undercover BBC documentary titled "The Secret Agent". He was questioned at a police station in Halifax, West Yorkshire, before being freed on police bail. He said that the arrest was "an electoral scam to get the Muslim block vote back to the Labour party" and that the Labour government was attempting to influence the results of the following year's general election.
Griffin's arrest was made two days after those of John Tyndall and several other people, over remarks they had made in the same programme. Following its broadcast on 15 July 2004, the police began an investigation into the programme's contents. The following April he was charged with four offences of using words or behaviour intended or likely to stir up racial hatred. The trial began in January 2006. Griffin stood alongside fellow party activist Mark Collett, who faced similar charges. Prosecuting, Rodney Jameson QC told the jury of six speeches that the accused had made in the Reservoir Tavern in Keighley on 19 January 2004. Reading excerpts from them, he claimed that they included threatening, abusive and insulting words directed at "people of Asian ethnicity", with the intention of "stirring up racial hatred".
Griffin was also accused of calling murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence a drug dealer and bully who stole younger pupils' dinner money. In the witness box he defended himself by quoting passages from the Qur'an, saying that his comments describing Islam as a "vicious, wicked faith" were attacking not a race, but a religion. During the two-week trial he used a laptop to post daily updates on a blog on the BNP's website. In his closing address, defence barrister Timothy King QC said:
Griffin and Collett were cleared of half the charges against them—the jury remained divided on the other charges, and a retrial was ordered. On 10 November 2006, after five hours of deliberations, the jury cleared them of all charges. They were met outside the court by about 200 supporters, who Griffin addressed with a megaphone. He attacked Tony Blair and the BBC, and defended the BNP's right to freedom of speech. BNP Deputy Chairman Simon Darby later claimed that had Griffin been convicted, the BNP leader planned to go on hunger strike.
Public debates.
Since his election as BNP leader, Griffin has been invited to participate in debates at several universities. In November 2002, the Cambridge Union Society invited him to take part in a debate the following January. Titled "This house believes that Islam is a threat to the west", the resolution was controversial; alongside more moderate speakers, one of those invited was Abu Hamza al-Masri, a fundamentalist Muslim cleric. Some participants threatened to withdraw, and several official bodies criticised the invitations. The two had met earlier in the year, in a debate chaired by "Today" programme editor Rod Liddle. He was also invited by the Cambridge Forum to a debate on extremism in December 2002, with Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik. The venue was changed twice after protests from property owners, but the threat of a violent confrontation between the Anti-Nazi League and BNP supporters forced the president of the Cambridge Forum, Chris Paley, to cancel the event. Paley called the decision an "own goal" for the values of free speech, and Öpik criticised it, emphasising his belief in "people's right to make their own decisions in a democracy".
In February 2005, Griffin was asked to take part in a debate on multiculturalism at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He was invited by the president of the students' debating society, who said "We believe that the only way to get the truth of what the BNP are saying and to combat them is to do it in public in a debate." The move was attacked by anti-racist groups, some of whom refused to participate in the discussion. Griffin said "I am coming up because I was invited by the students at the university because they have a debate on an intelligent subject on which I have something to say. The people against it are the usual bunch of people who cannot win the argument and refuse to stand on a platform." The society withdrew the invitation before the event was to take place.
In May 2007, Griffin was invited to address a meeting at the University of Bath by politics student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. The invitation was viewed by some as an attempt by the party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.
Several months later, the Oxford Union invited Griffin to speak at a forum on the limits of free speech, along with other speakers including David Irving. The invitation was condemned by the Equality and Human Rights Commission head Trevor Phillips and the president of the Oxford Students' Union. The Conservative MP Dr Julian Lewis resigned his membership of the Union. A rally against the invitation was held at Oxford Town Hall on 20 November, and included the Oxford Students' Union president, the National Union of Students black students' officer, and the Trades Union Congress south east regional secretary. Representatives of Unite Against Fascism also attended, as well as the University of Oxford's Jewish student chaplain. Several Holocaust survivors spoke at the rally. Stephen Altmann-Richer, co-president of the Oxford University Jewish Society, said "I don't think these people should be invited to the Oxford Union, by having them speak, it legitimises their views ..." On the night of the debate, about 50 protesters forced their way into the venue, and a crowd of hundreds gathered outside carrying banners bearing anti-racist slogans and voicing anti-BNP chants. Police blocked the entrances to the building, and removed the protesters encamped inside. Griffin was accompanied into the premises by security guards. The event was eventually split between two rooms, with Griffin speaking in one, and Irving in the other; many Union Society members were unable to gain access. Although many present found the debate objectionable, some were supportive of both Griffin and Irving's right to freedom of speech. The Oxford Union later endorsed the debate as a success.
Griffin travelled to the United States and spoke at Clemson University and Texas A&M University, but the reception he received in October 2007 at Michigan State University was markedly different from that in the other venues. Intending to address the "overpopulation of Islamists in Europe", he was repeatedly interrupted, to the point where the event became a question and answer session. He was heckled by hostile elements of the audience, and at one point the fire alarm was activated.
2009 appearance on "Question Time".
On 22 October 2009, Griffin took part in the BBC's topical debate programme, "Question Time", as a representative of the BNP. He appeared alongside Bonnie Greer, Jack Straw, Baroness Warsi and Chris Huhne. He was challenged by members of the studio audience, and questioned by host David Dimbleby on comments he had previously made on the Holocaust. His invitation followed the election of two BNP MEPs to the European Parliament, and led to significant debate over the merits of the BBC's decision. The appearance sparked a protest outside the BBC Television Centre prior to the recording of the programme, in which an estimated 500 people picketed the front entrance of the complex. Six protesters were arrested, and three members of the police service were injured. The programme dominated the following day's newspapers. In an editorial, "The Guardian" wrote: "Certainly, the week has provided the first serious scrutiny on BNP policies, and they have proved to be as vicious as feared." Max Hastings wrote "... the panel had little difficulty making Griffin seem slippery and indeed repugnant ..." in the "Daily Mail", and "The Sun" columnist Kelvin MacKenzie said "He emerged as the lying piece of work you always suspected." However, Minette Marrin, writing in "The Sunday Times", later said that Griffin had been "tormented like a crazed bull in a bullring" and "thrown to a sanctimonious mob", and "Independent" writer Stephen Glover said "In short, there was a lot of sound and fury but virtually no illumination, and Mr Griffin was largely spared."
In a press conference held on 23 October, Griffin stated that he would make a formal complaint about the format of the programme, which he said was "... not a genuine "Question Time"; that was a lynch mob". He suggested that he should appear again, but that "...  should do it properly, and talk about the issues of the day", and added: "That audience was taken from a city that is no longer British ... That was not my country any more. Why not come down and do it in Thurrock, do it in Stoke, do it in Burnley? Do it somewhere where there are still significant numbers of English and British people, and they haven't been ethnically cleansed from their own country."
Policies and views.
Griffin describes himself as a "moderniser", and "new nationalist", and upon his election as leader of the BNP, according to "Guardian" writer Francis Wheen, was "contemptuous" of the party's traditional supporters. He has changed the BNP's traditional focus on immigration and race, to a defence of what it sees as "our traditional principles against the politically correct agenda" espoused by mainstream politicians. He has portrayed himself as a defender of free speech, and has repeatedly spoken about multiculturalism. During 2000, he attempted to further the BNP's popular appeal by targeting specific groups, including lorry drivers—some of whom were at the time engaged in mass protests against fuel prices—and farmers. The BNP also produced a journal devoted to rural matters.
The BNP's constitution grants its chairman full executive power over all party affairs, and Griffin thus carries sole responsibility for the party's legal and financial liabilities, and has the final say in all decisions affecting the party. The BNP's policies include a halt to all immigration, the forced repatriation of all illegal immigrants, and the deportation of criminals whose original nationality was not British. It is opposed to a single European currency, and supports British withdrawal from the European Union (EU). It promises to "free the police and courts from the politically correct straitjacket that is stopping them from doing their job properly". It believes that British industry should be prioritised, that foreign imports should be strictly regulated, and that defence spending should be increased. Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would be invited to join a "federation of the nations of the British Isles". Its policy on education includes improving discipline in classrooms, and selective industry training for students. Greater production of home-grown food would be encouraged, and the party supports the National Health Service. It would restore the pensions earnings link, and the decentralisation of government decision-making.
Upon his election to the European Parliament Griffin unsuccessfully tried to form an alliance with right-wing parties (which would have entitled them to extra funding). He has also held talks with other far-right European parties, such as Vlaams Belang and Jobbik. The BNP maintains ties with Roberto Fiore and fascist groups across Europe. Griffin has criticised the Labour government for its attitude toward the BNP, accusing it of treating elected representatives of the BNP as "second-class citizens". Following his election, in a press conference held at a public house in Manchester, he criticised the privatisation of national industries, such as the railway network, and accused MPs generally of being involved in this "... giant looting of Britain". He accused private corporations and the "ruling elite" in Britain of building a "Eurocratic state", a process he called "Mussolini fascism ... under Gordon Brown." He supported the Gurkhas, stating that the BNP would allow them and their families entry to the country for medical treatment "for as long as they needed treatment, or for as long as they lived." He also suggested the removal of 100,000 Muslims "disloyal to Britain" and their replacement with the Gurkhas.
Griffin has frequently expressed views on Judaism, Islam and homosexuality. His comments on the Holocaust (which he once referred to as "the Holohoax") made as an editor of "The Rune" demonstrate revisionism. He criticised Holocaust denier David Irving for admitting that up to four million Jews might have died in the Holocaust; he wrote "True Revisionists will not be fooled by this new twist to the sorry tale of "The Hoax of the Twentieth Century"." In 1997, he told an undercover journalist that he had updated Richard Verrall's booklet "Did Six Million Really Die?" and, in the same year, he wrote "Who are the Mindbenders?", about a perceived domination of the media by Jewish figures. Despite this, the BNP had a Jewish councillor, Patricia Richardson, and spokesman Phil Edwards has stated that the party also has Jewish members. The BNP has stated that it does not deny the Holocaust, and that "Dredging up quotes from 10, 15, 20 years ago is really pathetic and, in a sense, rather fascist." In an interview with BNP deputy leader Simon Darby, Griffin claimed that the English Defence League was a "Zionist false flag operation", and added that the organisation is "a neo-con operation". He also claimed that the EDL's activities are an attempt to provoke civil war.
Since assuming control of the party, Griffin has sought to move it away from its historic identity, although on the BBC's "Newsnight" on 26 June 2001 he stated that Hindus and whites had both been targeted in the "Muslim" riots of 2001, and in the August 2001 issue of "Identity" (a BNP publication) he claimed that radical Muslim clerics wanted "... militant Muslims to take over British cities with AK-47 rifles". When interviewed in August 2009 for RT, he distanced himself from the present-day National Front, which he claimed is "... a group of skinheads running around with no political direction, other than that we suspect which their masters give them." On "The Politics Show" on 9 March 2003, he appeared to accept ethnic minorities who were already legally living in the country, and, on 6 March 2008, he was again interviewed on "Newsnight"; when told of a poll that demonstrated that most working-class Britons were more concerned about drugs and alcohol than immigration, he linked the UK's drug problem with Islam, specifically Pakistani immigrants. His inclusion on the programme was criticised by contributor and radio presenter Jon Gaunt, who branded the decision as "pathetic". When asked by "The Times" about concerns that his recent success was presaged in Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech, Griffin replied:
In a June 2009 interview with Channel 4 News, Griffin claimed that "There's no such thing as a black Welshman", which was criticised by Vaughan Gething (the first black president of the Welsh NUS and the Welsh TUC, and the first black candidate for the Welsh assembly). Commenting on Griffin's claim, he said "On that basis, most white people wouldn't qualify. It's quite clear that Nick Griffin just doesn't accept that black British people or black Welsh people are entitled to call themselves proper, full citizens of the country." Griffin's interview with "Channel 4 News" was in response to a decision by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate the BNP's membership criteria, which, it stated, "appeared to discriminate on the grounds of race and colour, contrary to the Race Relations Act." He rejected claims that the BNP was "acting unlawfully" and said "... because we are here, as it was pointed out, for specific ethnic groups—it's nothing to do with colour, your reporter there said that we'll only lift a finger for white people—that's a simple lie." In an interview with the BBC on 8 July 2009, during a discussion on European immigration, he proposed that the EU should sink boats carrying illegal immigrants, to prevent them from entering Europe. Although the interviewer (BBC correspondent Shirin Wheeler) implied that Griffin may have wished the EU to "murder people at sea", he quickly corrected her by saying "I didn't say anyone should be murdered at sea—I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft and they can go back to Libya" (a staging post for migrants from Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa).
Following the Admiral Duncan pub bombing by former BNP member David Copeland, Griffin stated "The TV footage of dozens of 'gay' demonstrators flaunting their perversion in front of the world's journalists showed just why so many ordinary people find these creatures so repulsive." The BNP states that, privately, homosexuality should be tolerated, but that it "should not be promoted or encouraged". It opposed the introduction of civil partnerships and wishes to ban what it perceives as the promotion of homosexuality in schools and the media.
A series of messages he posted in October 2012 on the social network Twitter, regarding a discrimination claim won by a gay couple, sparked widespread opprobrium. Cambridgeshire police investigated the tweets, which included the couple's address and a suggestion that a "British Justice team" would give them "a bit of drama", but took no further action.
Writing for "The Rune", Griffin praised the wartime Waffen SS and attacked the Royal Air Force for its bombing of Nazi Germany, and in 1996 during a public demonstration at Coventry Cathedral he accused British airmen of "mass murder". Although unconnected, on 9 June 2009 the Royal British Legion wrote an open letter to Griffin asking him not to wear a poppy lapel badge.
In a BBC interview on 8 June 2009, Griffin claimed that "global warming is essentially a hoax" and that it "is being exploited by the liberal elite as a means of taxing and controlling us and the real crisis is peak oil". He was a representative of the European Parliament at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference, where he repeated his claim that global warming is a hoax, and called advocates of action on climate change such as Al Gore "mass murderers" by supporting biofuels, claiming that their use would lead to the "third and the greatest famine of the modern era". A Greenpeace spokesman said, "In reality the environmental and development groups he has been disparaging have been in the forefront of concerns about biofuels. Griffin's claims that climate change is a hoax is one of many curious things going on between his ears."
Family and personal life.
Parents.
Griffin's father, Edgar Griffin (born 1921, Brighton, East Sussex) was previously a long-standing Conservative Party member and from 1959 to 1965 a councillor for the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone. He also served as a councillor on Waveney District Council during the 1980s. Griffin's mother, Jean (née Thomas), whom Edgar married in 1950, was an unsuccessful BNP candidate for Enfield North in the 1997 general election, in Chingford & Woodford Green for the 2001 general election and for London in the 1999 European elections.
Personal life.
Griffin lives with his family in a farmhouse in Llanerfyl, near Welshpool, in Wales. He is married to Jackie Griffin, a former nurse who also acts as his assistant and a BNP administrator. He has four children, some of whom are actively involved with the party, and a sister. He was declared bankrupt in January 2014.
Elections contested.
UK Parliament elections
Welsh Assembly elections (Additional members region; party list)
European Parliament elections (Multi-member constituency; party list)

Alithies &amp; Psemata

Alithies & Psemata (Greek: Αλήθειες & Ψέματα; English: Truths & Lies) is the title of the 7th studio album by Greek Modern Laika singer Antonis Remos. The 15 track album was released on November 18, 2008 by Sony BMG Greece and is his first studio album of entirely new material since 2005.
Background.
The original release date had been set at November 13, but the album's release was delayed until the 18th. The album represents Remos' collaboration with numerous established Laika and Greek pop songwriters, as well as other songwriters. Prominent singer-songwriter Antonis Vardis is the chief music composer of the album with seven tracks and with lyrics by Vasilis Giannopoulos, including the first single "Pote". Stefanos Korkolis has composed the music along with lyrics by Nikos Moraïtis to two songs. "Den Iparhi Meta" is a cover with Greek lyrics of the French song "Une Femme A Qui L'On Ment" sung by Chimène Badi. Other music composers include: Christos Dantis, Apostolis Valaroutsos, Harry Varthakouris, Kostas Baltazanis, and Kiriakos Papadopoulos; other lyricists include: Nikos Gritsis, Mirto Kontova, Antonis Andrikakis, Kiriakos Papadopoulos, Apostolis Valaroutsos, Harry Varthakouris, and Nikos Sarris. Remos spent a long time in studio sifting through many songs to choose for his upcoming studio release. Sfera radio station was the main sponsor of the album.
Promotion.
For the promotion of the album, Remos began appearances at the Athinon Arena on November 14, 2008 where he performed many of the songs on the album throughout the winter season. Supporting acts included Athina Routsi and group Emigre.
Singles.
"Pote"
"Ekato Fores Kommatia"
"Eho Esena"
Chart performance.
"Alithies & Psemata" debuted at number one on the IFPI charts for week 48, and was certified Gold the same week. By its second week, it had dipped to number three, and number twenty-nine by week seven. As of the week 16/2009 charts, the album had charted for 13 weeks.
The album placed at number ten on IFPI's Year-end chart for "Top 50 Greek albums of 2008", and number eleven on the "Top 50 Greek and International albums of 2008".
On March 2009 IFPI Greece announced that they would close their charts for a period of time in order to renew their charting system, thus it is not possible to track the chart and sales records of "Alithies & Psemata". On July 17, 2009 IFPI confirmed via email that the album reached Platinum status in Greece. IFPI Greece is set to resume public release of charts in the coming months.

Beta Pictoris b

Beta Pictoris b is an extrasolar planet located approximately 63 light-years away in the constellation of Pictor, orbiting the 4th magnitude debris disk star Beta Pictoris. It has a mass between 4 and 11 Jupiter masses and a radius around 65% larger than Jupiter's. It orbits at 8-9 AU from Beta Pictoris (close to the plane of the debris disk orbiting the star) with an low eccentricity and a period of 17–21 years, and is the only known planet in the Beta Pictoris system. The planet was discovered on November 18, 2008 by LaGrange "et al.", using the NACO instrument on the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in northern Chile. This planet was discovered using the direct imaging technique utilizing reference star differential imaging. The discovery image was taken in 2003, but the planet was not detected when the data was first reduced. A re-reduction of the data in 2008 using modern image processing tools revealed the faint point source now known to be a planet.
Follow-up observations performed in late 2009 and early 2010 using the same instrument recovered and confirmed the planet, but on the opposite side of the star. These finding were published in the journal Science and represented the closest orbiting planet to its star ever imaged. Observations performed in late 2010 and early 2011 allowed scientists to establish an inclination angle of the planet's orbit of 88.5 degrees, nearly edge-on. The location of the planet was found to be approximately 3.5 to 4 degrees tilted from the main disk in this system, indicating that the planet is aligned with the warped inner disk in the Beta Pictoris system.
The first study of the spectral energy distribution of the planet was published in July 2013.
This study shows detections at 1.265, 1.66, 2.18, 3.80, 4.05 and 4.78 µm demonstrating that the planet has a very dusty and/or cloudy atmosphere. The SED is consistent with that of an early L dwarf, but with a lower surface gravity. The effective temperature is constrained to and the surface gravity to log g = 4.0 . A second study, published in September 2013, provided a new detection at 3.1 µm obtained at the Gemini Observatory along with a reanalysis of previous data. They found the planet to be overluminous in the mid-infrared 3.1 µm band compared to models of early L dwarfs. Models incorporating small dust particles and thick clouds provided the best fit to the SED. The effective temperature is constrained to and the surface gravity to log g = 3.8 . This fit corresponds to a planet radius of 1.65 times that of Jupiter, arguing that Beta Pictoris b may be younger than its host star (finished forming at 5 Ma).

Cailliet Method

The Cailliet Method is a method of learning the saxophone originally devised by French-born American composer Lucien Cailliet, which he described in the two published volumes named "Cailliet Method for Saxophone". The method itself focuses on the inclusion of Music Theory in order to accentuate the role of harmonies, counterpoints and orchestration, to evoke appreciation from the musician on their importance within music, without departing too much from the sake of instrumental training.
The emphasis within the Cailliet method is based upon the belief that "one should know a subject completely before specializing in any part of it". The method itself encompasses traditional methods such as scales and arpeggios with various additional articulations for the purpose of increasing proficiency, but also involves the study of various other forms of musical notation and concept. Amongst these additional studies is the diminished seventh, which Cailliet described as vague, unexplained and even mysterious to trained musicians.
The other focuses, as described by the second volume of the method are:

Hurumlandet is a peninsula in Buskerud county, Norway. It is situated west of the Oslofjord and east of the Drammensfjord. It comprises the municipalities Røyken and Hurum. Hurumlandet is located south of Asker. It is connected to Follo through the subsea Oslofjord Tunnel. Before 1990, Hurumlandet was the planned location for the new Oslo Airport. Ultimately, the airport was allocated to Gardermoen.
History.
Since the Middle Ages, Hurumlandet was a strategic headland at the entrance to the country's capital. Militarily the peninsula has been of great importance and fortifications date since the Middle Ages. West at the Drammenfjord are fortifications from the 1890s.
Geography.
The bedrock is very varied with the remains of an ancient volcano in the central and Ersvika and a lot of red granite in key areas. Hurum municipality consists mostly of granite deposits in the west and center parties, with deposits of shale and sandstone in a belt in the south and east. In the south there are also some limestone and a raised section of Ordovician, and started rock and quartzite parties.
Nature preserves.
Hurum country has a disproportionate number of protected natural areas, due to the very rich and diverse biology on the peninsula. Hurum country has coastal coniferous forest and a rich fauna, particularly on the Toft islets. Wildlife includes moose, osprey, cormorant and eider.
In the south there are eight conservation areas - Holtnesdalen Nature Reserve, Solfjellåsene Nature Reserve (limestone habitats), Haraldsfjellet Nature Reserve (limestone habitats), Sandbukta-Østnestangen Nature Reserve (vegetation), Ersvikskjær Nature Reserve (bird), Tofteskogen Nature Reserve (forest), Ranvikholmen Nature Reserve (plant) and Tofteholmen Nature Reserve (plant). Further to the northeast lies Storskjær Nature Reserve outside Sætre.

Federation of Irish Fishermen

The Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) is the umbrella organization for the three main Fish Producing Organizations (FPOs) in Ireland. It consists of The Irish Fish Producers Organization Ltd (IFPO), The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation Ltd.(IS&WFPO), and The Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation Ltd (KFO). Currently, the FIF represents over 90% of the Irish fishing fleet.
The mission statement of the FIF is "to provide a unified voice for the Irish Fishing Industry and to provide an active input into all policy making decisions both nationally and internationally." The group participates in extensive lobbying on behalf of the livelihood of its members and their professions, as well as organizes demonstrations and other national events to benefit the national industry.
History.
The FIF was founded in 2006 in response to the ever waning fishing industry in Ireland due to imports of cheaper fish from elsewhere on the European Continent. The establishment of the organization was a formalization of already tight coalitions between the smaller member organizations. It was initially chaired by the then CEO of The Irish Fish Producers Organization, Lorcán Ó Cinnéide.
Leadership.
The FIF’s leadership structure is a Board of Chief Executives from the constituent organizations:
The position of Chairman of the Board changes each year, rotating between the CEOs of the three constituent fish producing organizations. As of 1 January 2014 the position is held by Seán O'Donoghue of the KFO.
Action.
The FIF have been responsible for a number of demonstrations on behalf of the Irish Fishing Industry since its inception. Some of these actions include:
Treaty of Lisbon.
The FIF claims to have played a vital role in the national veto of the Treaty of Lisbon, an EU document seeking to consolidate leadership and increase functionality of international trade within the EU. By Irish constitutional law, such a motion had to be voted on in a public referendum. The FIF took a strong stance against the treaty, claiming that its trade provisions for the fish market would be unhealthy for the already struggling Irish industry. A series of actions before and after the Lisbon vote on 12 June (to which the Irish delivered a very sound “no”) occurred, including fish dumps, harbor blocking, boat tie ups, and numerous other acts.
However when protocols were agreed with the other EU states, on issues such as neutrality, the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was passed by the people with a 67% majority.

Formula Ford Festival

The Formula Ford Festival is an annual meeting of Ford powered single seat racing cars which is held at the end of the British racing season, at the Brands Hatch motor racing circuit in the county of Kent, in Southern England. The events are held over the course of a weekend and although various classes of past and present Formula Fords are present, the high point for many is the championship in which young but skilled drivers from Ford competitions in Europe and beyond race against one another. Often it is a rare chance to compare the skills of drivers who take part in different Ford competitions across the world. Many winners of the festival have gone on to enjoy professional careers in various branches of motorsport - including fourteen who have raced in Formula One.
The event is administered by the British Racing and Sports Car Club.[http://www.brscc.co.uk/]
History.
Inception.
The inaugural season in 1972 took place at Snetterton, where the festival was held until 1975. It then moved to Brands Hatch where it has stayed to date.
The Kent years.
The Kent engine was the lead engine in early Formula Ford, and so from the first festival in 1972 until the Zetec was introduced in 1993.
The Zetec years.
The Zetec engine was the leading engine from 1993 until the Duratec took over in 2006.
The Duratec engine.
The 1600 c.c. Duratec engine is currently used in the leading races although the Zetec and Kent engines are still used in junior and classic classes of racing.[http://www.brscc.co.uk/formula-ford-ferstival.html]
Loss of prominence.
For many years the festival was the highlight of the Formula Ford season. Entries of several hundred cars from all over the Formula Ford world were common into the 1990s, with racers competing in knockout heats to decide the grid for a grand final. Entries have been declining and recent Festivals have struggled to attract more than 40-50 cars, enough for two heats and a final.
Support races from other classes e.g. Caterham, Club F3 and Historic Sports 2000 have also been included in the program. This is because although the event still has the atmosphere of past years its position as a rite of passage for young drivers has largely been usurped by other junior formulae and karting.
More "historic" FF1600 cars have been turning up for the supporting races than contemporary Zetecs, however in 2006 the Festival saw the Duratec engine for the first time thereby having a final for all 3 marques at one meeting for the first time. The Walter Hayes Trophy now recognises the continuing interest in 1600cc 'Kent' Formula Ford and attracted over 150 entries in 2006, including several drivers more commonly seen in much more senior formulae.
Winners.
Below is a list of overall festival winners. Since 1993, a secondary festival was run in alongside for older specification cars running the Ford Kent engine. Since 2009, a third event has also been held for cars using the Ford Zetec engine.

Thomas Leavitt (banker)

Thomas Leavitt (1795–1850) was an early president of the Bank of New Brunswick in his native Saint John, New Brunswick. Leavitt was also a diplomat, politician and powerful Canadian businessman with interests in the shipping industry.
Thomas Leavitt was the descendant of early New Hampshire settlers. Capt. Jonathan Leavitt's wife was Hephzibah (Peabody) Leavitt, daughter of Capt. Francis Peabody, a Massachusetts native who came north following the French and Indian War to settle lands he was granted to form a township in New Brunswick. 
Capt. Leavitt arrived in New Brunswick in August 1762 aboard ship from Newburyport, Massachusetts, with father-in-law Peabody, as well as James Simmons and James White, for whom he worked as a mariner at the firm of shipowners Simmons, Hazen & White, whose partners he was related to by marriage. (Leavitt and James Simmons and James White had married daughters of Francis Peabody). Jonathan Leavitt had eight sons, including Thomas Leavitt, and two daughters. 
The Leavitt family later joined their relations in the shipping business, becoming shipowners, mariners and prominent merchants in Saint John, which following the Revolutionary War had a substantial American Loyalist population. By 1774, mariner Leavitt was actively engaged in shipbuilding, joining forces that year with brother-in-law Samuel Peabody to order construction of one of the earliest schooners built in New Brunswick, the "Menaguashe".
Early in his career, mariner Leavitt grew discouraged with his prospects, fearing that New Brunswick would never support a shipping industry like that of Boston or Halifax, Nova Scotia. Jonathan Leavitt and his brother Daniel mulled over moving elsewhere where "there was a larger population and more business", reported "The New Brunswick Magazine". Leavitt's brother-in-law and sometime employer James White intervened, telling the two brothers: "Don't be discouraged, boys, keep up a good heart! Why ships will come here from England yet!"
The industry that Jonathan Leavitt pioneered later blossomed, especially after the influx of Loyalists following the Revolutionary War. Capt. Jonathan Leavitt and his brother Capt. Daniel Leavitt were among those who piloted into Saint John's harbor the fleet of vessels carrying thousands of American Loyalists from New York City in 1784. The influx of Loyalists stoked the Saint John economy: it would later rank fourth among shipbuilding cities of the British Empire, earning it the sobriquet of "the Liverpool of North America". Leavitt and his family became recipients of that boom.
At his death in 1811, former ship captain Jonathan Leavitt left a large estate including properties scattered across Saint John and a large tract on the Miramichi River. Leavitt's son Thomas took over the reins of the family business. He was admitted a merchant freeman of Saint John in 1817, and subsequently played a major role in business affairs of New Brunswick.
By the 1840s Leavitt was firmly established as a major player in the region, acting as agent for the Liverpool Association of Underwriters, and for several New York marine insurance companies. Early on Thomas Leavitt obtained a perpetual lease on a harborside lot, allowing him to build his own wharf for his shipping interests as well as charging wharfage fees to other merchants.
By 1835 Leavitt, the son of an American emigrant to Canada, was named United States Consul for Saint John. Leavitt was confirmed by the United States Senate as U.S. Consul in 1835. He served in the post for eight years, until 1845.
Shortly afterwards Thomas Leavitt helped found City Bank in 1837, and subsequently became president of the Bank of New Brunswick after its merger with City Bank. 
Leavitt also helped establish the extension of the new Morse Telegraph system to the Maritime Provinces of Canada. He was listed first among incorporators of the New Brunswick Telegraph Company, whose mission was connecting the incipient telegraph line from Maine through New Brunswick to Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Aside from his business interests, Leavitt also served as the Worshipful Master of the Freemasons in New Brunswick. 
Leavitt was a Church of Scotland Presbyterian, and was active in St. Andrew's Church in Saint John, where he participated in the 1832 attempt by church trustees to wrest control of church finances from the elders. Leavitt was also part of a large group of Saint John Presbyterians who challenged the Church of England’s monopoly on education in the province in the 1830s. The group successfully demanded the appointment of non-Episcopalians to the Madras School Board and to the council of King’s College.
Thomas Leavitt died in Saint John on October 24, 1850, at the age of 55. Leavitt and his wife Mary Ann (née Ketchum) had four sons and three daughters. The Leavitt family papers, including logbooks for the family's fleet of vessels, family correspondence, bills and promissory notes and other memorabilia, are deposited at the New Brunswick Museum.
The family's name is pronounced "Lovett" in New Brunswick.

<doc id="20398217" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20398217" title="First National Bank of Charlotte">
First National Bank of Charlotte

First National Bank of Charlotte was a bank located in Charlotte, North Carolina from 1865 until 1930.
Early history.
In 1853, John Wilkes, the son of Admiral Charles Wilkes, moved to Charlotte to supervise his family's mining and milling business. He served under the Confederacy during the Civil War, but he was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward. Soon after the end of the war, Wilkes started the first national bank in the South after the war. By December 15, 1865, Wilkes had received $500,000 in U.S. bonds. The same year, First National Bank became the only North Carolina bank printing National Bank Notes.
This bank played a major role in Charlotte's growth, as did the city's railroad access to other areas. Rufus Y. McAden, founder of the mills and mill village that became McAdenville, succeeded Wilkes as bank president in 1867. Robert M. Oates became president in 1891, and McAden's son Henry M. McAden served as president from 1907 until the bank's failure in 1930.
Later years.
Rufus McAden and his family actually lived in the bank's three-story building on South Tryon Street. His son demolished the building in 1925 and chose Louis Asbury, a leading Charlotte architect who had designed Henry's Myers Park home in 1916, to design what became the second tallest building in the state. The opening of the 250-foot, 21-story building, built at a cost of $1.8 million, was announced September 9, 1927, and the "Charlotte News" proclaimed Charlotte's strength as a banking center. 
Later in 1927, the Federal Reserve opened its branch office on the building's ninenteenth floor. This showed Charlotte appeared likely to become a major banking center. However, three years after it opened, the building was only 30 percent occupied. The bank would not rent to just anyone, unlike the nearby Johnston Building.
Failure.
On December 4, 1930, First National Bank announced it was closed. One reason given for the bank's failure was the ambitious building program, combined with the inability to make money from the new skyscraper. At the time, First National had only $1.6 million in deposits, the least of seven commercial banks in the city.

Andy Oyler

Andrew Paul (Pepper) Oyler (May 5, 1880 – October 24, 1970) was a Major League Baseball third baseman. He was born in Newville, Pennsylvania and attended Washington & Jefferson College. He played professionally for the Baltimore Orioles in the season. In 27 professional games that year, he had 77 at-bats with 17 hits and one home run.
He batted and threw right-handed. He was small in stature and was an excellent fielder, but not a good hitter. Even so, he was difficult to pitch to, since he would crouch "pretzel-like" in the batter's box to make his strike zone smaller. He died in East Pennsboro Township, Pennsylvania.
Shortest home run in history.
In 1953, sportswriter Jocko Maxwell published an article in "Baseball Digest" describing the shortest home run in baseball history. Maxwell described a baseball game where Oyler, as a shortstop for the Minneapolis Millers, was crouched in the batters' box in the bottom of the 9th and ducked to avoid a pitch thrown at his head. The ball hit off of Oyler's bat, which was still resting on his shoulder, and became stuck in the mud in front of home plate. Oyler was able to complete an inside-the-park home run before any opposing players were able to find the ball. Maxwell's article indicated that the story was originally told by WWRL radio station in Woodside, New York. This story was repeated by sportswriter Bill Bryson, Sr. in "Baseball Digest" in 1958. Another version of the story, as told by Halsey Hall, had Oyler chopping at a low pitch and sticking the ball into the mud 5 feet from home plate.
Baseball historian Stew Thornley is skeptical of the story of Oyler's home run, pointing out that no contemporary news reports described the incident. Other modern reference sources recount the story without caveat.
The story was the subject of a book of baseball lore by Michael G. Bryson called "The Twenty-Four-Inch Home Run." It was also the inspiration for the children's book, "Mudball" by Matt Tavares, which won the 2005 Parents' Choice Awards Gold Award. In the "Author's Note" Tavares describes the story of Oyler's home run as being folklore.

Kirk Cameron

Kirk Thomas Cameron (born October 12, 1970) is an American actor. He is known for his role as Mike Seaver on the television situation comedy "Growing Pains" (1985–92), as well as several other television and film appearances as a child actor. In the 1980s and 1990s, Cameron appeared in dozens of television shows and in the films "Like Father Like Son" and "Listen to Me". In the 2000s, he has portrayed Cameron "Buck" Williams in the "Left Behind" film series and Caleb Holt in the 2008 drama film, "Fireproof". Cameron is also an active evangelical Christian, partnering with Ray Comfort in the evangelical ministry "The Way of the Master", and has co-founded The Firefly Foundation with his wife, actress Chelsea Noble.
Early life.
Cameron was born in Panorama City, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. His parents are Robert Cameron, a retired school teacher, and Barbara (Bausmith), a stay-at-home mother. He is the brother to Bridgette, Melissa, and Candace Cameron Bure, who is most notable for her role as D.J. Tanner on the popular television sitcom, "Full House". He went to school on the set of "Growing Pains", as opposed to public school. He graduated from high school at age 17 with high honors.
Cameron and his wife, fellow "Growing Pains" star Chelsea Noble, were married on July 21, 1991. They now have six children, four of whom were adopted: Jack (born 1996), Isabella (born 1997), Anna (born 1998), and Luke (born 2000); and two biological: Olivia Rose (born July 18, 2001) and James Thomas (born April 13, 2003).
Acting career.
Cameron began acting at age nine, and his first job was in an advertisement for a breakfast cereal. His first starring role was at age 13, in the television series "Two Marriages". At this age, he appeared in several television shows and films. He became famous in 1985 after being cast as Mike Seaver in the ABC television sitcom "Growing Pains". In the series, Mike would eventually have a girlfriend in Kate MacDonald, played by Chelsea Noble, Cameron's future wife. Cameron subsequently became a teen heartthrob in the late 1980s, while appearing on the covers of several teen magazines, including "Tiger Beat", "Teen Beat", "16" and others. At the time, he was making $50,000 a week. He was also in a 60-second Pepsi commercial during Super Bowl XXIV.
Cameron also guest starred in "Just One of the Guys" a 1988 episode of "Full House" in which he played the cousin of D.J. Tanner, who was played by Cameron's sister, Candace.
Cameron went on to star in many films, including 1987's "Like Father Like Son" (a body-switch comedy with Dudley Moore), which was a box office success. His next theatrical film, 1989's "Listen to Me", performed poorly at the box office. When "Growing Pains" ended in 1992, Cameron went on to star in The WB sitcom "Kirk" which premiered in 1995 and ended two years later. In "Kirk", Cameron played Kirk Hartman, a 24-year-old who has to raise his siblings. Cameron and Noble also worked together on "Kirk".
Cameron has since left mainstream film, though a decade after "Growing Pains" ended, he starred in a television reunion film, "The Growing Pains Movie", in 2000, and another one, ', in 2004. Cameron reunited with the cast of "Growing Pains" for a CNN "Larry King Live" interview which aired on February 7, 2006, in conjunction with the Warner Bros. release of the complete first season of "Growing Pains" on DVD. Aside from this, Cameron has often worked in Christian-themed productions, among them the post-Rapture films ', ', and ', in which he plays Cameron "Buck" Williams. Cameron's wife Noble also starred in the film series, playing Hattie Durham. Cameron has worked with Cloud Ten Pictures, a company which produces Christian-themed films, and has starred in several of their films, including "The Miracle of the Cards".
He also appeared in the 2008 drama film, "Fireproof", which was produced by Sherwood Pictures. The film was created on a budget of $500,000, with Cameron as the lead actor, portraying Captain Caleb Holt. Though it was a low-budget film, the film grossed $33,415,129 and was a box office success. It was the highest grossing independent film of 2008.
In 2012, Cameron was the narrator and host of the documentary film "". On its opening day, March 27, 2012, "Monumental" grossed $28,340. The film stayed in theaters until May 20, 2012, grossing a total of $177,729.
In 2013, Cameron announced he would be the host of the film "Unstoppable" slated to premiere September 24, 2013. The film garnered widespread media attention for the claim by Cameron that Facebook banned the trailer he posted. Facebook has since taken down the block, claiming it was the result of "automated systems" that had made a "mistake."
Conversion to Christianity.
Cameron says he was an atheist in his early teens. When he was 17, during the height of his career on "Growing Pains", he became a born-again Christian. After converting to Christianity, he began to insist that storylines be edited to remove anything he thought too adult or inappropriate in "Growing Pains". After the series was cancelled, Cameron did not maintain contact with his former co-stars, and did not speak to Tracey Gold for eight years. Cameron has stated that this was not due to any animosity on his part toward any of his former cast-members, but an outgrowth of his desire to start a new life away from the entertainment industry, and the life he had been in for the previous seven years. Prior to the premiere of "The Growing Pains Movie" in 2000, for which the entire main cast reunited, Cameron described his regrets over how his relationship with his castmates changed after his religious conversion during production of the series, saying, "I definitely kind of made an about-face, going toward another aspect of my life," admits Cameron. "I shifted my focus from 100% on the show, to 100% on new life, and left 0% on the show--and even the friendships that were a part of that show. If I could go back, I think I could make decisions that were less inadvertently hurtful to the cast--like talking and explaining to them why I just wanted to have my family at my wedding."
Evangelistic ministry.
Cameron currently partners with fellow evangelist Ray Comfort, training Christians in evangelism. Together, they founded the ministry of "The Way of the Master", which is best known for the television show of the same name that Cameron co-hosts, and which won the National Religious Broadcasters’ Best Program Award for two consecutive years. It also formerly featured a radio show known as "The Way of the Master Radio" with talk show host Todd Friel. The radio show was later canceled, and replaced with "Wretched Radio", hosted by Friel. Cameron, along with his wife, founded "The Firefly Foundation", which runs "Camp Firefly", a summer camp that gives terminally ill children and their families a free week's vacation.
Cameron and Comfort participated in a televised debate with atheists Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Conner of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church, in Manhattan, on May 5, 2007. It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on "Nightline". At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolutionary theory. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the rules by talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on the Way of the Master radio show that the rules of the debate did not say that the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort simply had to come up with one argument that didn't reference the Bible or faith.
In November 2009, Cameron and others distributed free copies of an altered version of Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" on college campuses in the United States. The book consisted of Darwin's text with chapters of the book removed, and with an added introduction by Ray Comfort reiterating common creationist assertions about Darwin and evolution. The book was criticized by scientists and Darwin biographers who criticized the omission of key chapters of the book, and who stated that its introduction contains misinformation about Darwin, and long-refuted creationist arguments about the science of evolution, such as the linking of Nazi racial theories to Darwinist ideas. Comfort later said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted in order to make the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, but that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and glossary of terms. The National Center for Science Education arranged a campaign to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction and a banana bookmark at colleges across the U.S.</ref>
In March 2012, Cameron stated on "Piers Morgan Tonight" that "homosexuality is unnatural, detrimental and ultimately destructive to foundations of civilization". Cameron's comments received criticism from GLAAD, and provoked a backlash from gay rights activists and members of the entertainment industry, including Roseanne Barr, Kristin Chenoweth, Craig Ferguson, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Debra Messing, Martha Plimpton, as well as "Growing Pains" co-stars Tracey Gold and Alan Thicke. Piers Morgan stated that Cameron was brave for expressing his opinion, "however antiquated his beliefs may be". Rosie O'Donnell invited him to discuss his comments on same-sex marriage on "The Rosie Show", but he declined and suggested a private dinner to discuss this topic personally.
On April 11, 2012, Cameron was honored by Indiana Wesleyan University, and inducted into their Society of World Changers during a ceremony in which he spoke on IWU's campus.

HONOReform

HONOReform (Hepatitis Outbreaks National Organization for Reform) – is a patient advocacy organization that seeks to promote adherence to injection safety guidelines and increase governmental oversight of outpatient medical facilities. In addition to promoting lessons learned from outbreaks of hepatitis C, the organization advocates for a more compassionate response to large scale medical disasters.
HONOReform was founded by patients and families impacted by a Nebraska outbreak of hepatitis C in which 99 cancer patients were infected when doctors and nurses at their oncology clinic were found to have reused syringes. For years it remained the largest outbreak of hepatitis C in American healthcare history, though similar tragedies continue to occur.
Since 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented 33 outbreaks of hepatitis B and C as a result of negligent injection safety practices in nonhospital healthcare settings. In January 2009, the "Annals of Internal Medicine" noted over 60,000 patients have been verified by the CDC to be potentially exposed to hepatitis in the outbreaks and that these outbreaks are likely only "the tip of the iceberg".
History.
HONOReform was founded by Evelyn McKnight, Dr. Tom McKnight, and Travis Bennington, all of Fremont, Nebraska. Evelyn McKnight is an audiologist who was battling a recurrence of breast cancer when she learned she had been infected with hepatitis C because improper injection safety protocols at the Fremont Cancer Center.
During chemotherapy treatments, medical professionals access multi-dose bags of saline to flush patient ports. Outbreaks occur as a result of doctors and nurses reusing syringes, contaminating the saline bag with the blood of multiple patients.
Tom McKnight – Evelyn’s husband – is a local family practice physician who helped uncover the outbreak when some of his patients were found to have hepatitis C. Travis Bennington is a local attorney who represented 19 of the 99 Nebraska patients in their malpractice claims.
HONOReform was founded in 2007 using settlement funds Evelyn McKnight secured in her malpractice trial. HONOReform was established to advocate patient justice, safety, and compassion by promoting the lessons learned from hepatitis outbreaks.
Mission & Activities.
Since its formation, HONOReform advocates have lobbied the U.S. Congress and federal health agencies for greater oversight of private physician offices and other stand-alone healthcare facilities. HONOReform has fought to raise awareness to widely accepted healthcare standards that call for using syringes and similar products once.
In addition to its federal advocacy efforts, HONOReform leaders have helped other communities recover from similar outbreaks. Following the Las Vegas, Nevada tragedy, Evelyn McKnight testified before the Nevada Legislature’s Legislative Committee on Health Care and also took part in numerous community healing and education events.
The One and Only Campaign.
On February 11, the Safe Injection Practices Coalition — composed of patient advocacy organizations, foundations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including Dr. Richard Besser, Acting Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Acting Administrator, provider associations and societies and industry partners — joined Congresswoman Shelley Berkley (D-NV) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) to launch the One & Only Campaign, an education and awareness initiative aimed at both healthcare providers and patients.
The campaign will utilize a number of training materials to eliminate knowledge gaps concerning injection safety among providers and empower patients to ask their healthcare providers the correct questions to keep them safe. The campaign is initially being piloted in Nevada.
Coalition partners for the One and Only Campaign include: CDC Foundation, HONOReform Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD), American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA), Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), Nevada State Medical Association, Nebraska Medical Association, and the Ambulatory Surgery Foundation.
Other notable outbreaks.
Las Vegas, Nevada.
In February 2008, the largest patient notification of its kind occurred when 40,000 patients of the Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas were urged to be tested for hepatitis and HIV. Subsequently, an additional 10,000 patients of the center along with 13,000 patients at the Desert Shadow Endoscopy Center were advised to be tested. To date, a total of 114 confirmed cases of hepatitis C have been linked to the outbreaks.
Grand Rapids, Michigan.
More than 16,000 patients of Grand Rapids, Michigan dermatologist Dr. Robert W. Stokes were issued letters urging them to be tested for hepatitis, HIV and other diseases. Dr. Stokes was accused of reusing on patients syringes and sutures intended for one-time use in one patient. Stokes is currently in federal prison, serving a 10-and-a-half-year sentence for insurance fraud, and has had his medical license revoked. Patients impacted by the outbreak pushed for a number of reforms including greater penalties for such actions and a measure that would prohibit or severely limit the reuse of medical devices.
Laurinburg, North Carolina.
In September 2008, 1,200 patients at a cardiology practice in Laurinburg, North Carolina were warned of exposure to hepatitis, HIV and other diseases because of unsafe medical practices at the office of Dr. Matthew Block. To date, eight patients have been tested positive for hepatitis in relation to procedures at the clinic.
Book exposing the Nebraska Outbreak.
In September 2008, Evelyn McKnight and Travis Bennington published a book focused on the Nebraska outbreak entitled "A Never Event: Exposing the Largest Outbreak of Hepatitis C in American Healthcare History". The book was originally produced, designed and published by Arbor Books and is now published by History Examined, LLC.

ICE T

DBAG Class 411 and Class 415 are German tilting high-speed electric multiple-unit trains in service with Deutsche Bahn (DB), commonly known as ICE T.
Development.
Following the successful inauguration of the Intercity-Express system in 1991 and the order to develop the ICE 2, in 1994 DB started plans to upgrade long-distance services using conventional lines, with higher speeds and a comfort level close to the ICE standard, using tilting electric multiple units to replace locomotive-hauled InterCity (IC) and InterRegio (IR) trains. DB assigned the name "IC T" to the project, with "T" standing for "Triebzug" (multiple unit).
Later, Deutsche Bahn also saw the need for a similar new train for its non-electrified routes, and started the "ICT-VT" project, with "VT" standing for "Verbrennungstriebwagen" (internal combustion motor car). This development resulted in the diesel-powered ICE TD.
Deutsche Bahn developed the ICE 3, IC T and ICT-VT projects in parallel. The trains share a general styling concept, notably a lounge section in the front separated only by a glass wall from the driver's compartment, with a view forward over the tracks. Technically, the trains share a lot of components and technical layout, as well as the concept of distributed traction: in contrast to the ICE 1 and ICE 2 designs, the new units were planned not with power cars, but with peripheral underfloor motors, to reduce axle load (important for tilting trains) and increase tractive effort.
At first plans were made for a three-car EMU, but in the end, capacity considerations led to a decision to create trains of two different lengths, five (later class 415) and seven (later class 411) cars, the combinations of which allow a sufficient variety of train lengths with a maximum of three trains coupled (possible variations are: 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15 cars total).
Production.
In 1994, Deutsche Bahn placed an order for 40 trains, revised to 43 trains (32 of the 7-car, 11 of the 5-car version) in 1997.
The trains were produced by a consortium led by DWA and including Siemens, DUEWAG and Fiat Ferroviaria. DWA (later taken over by Bombardier) produced the end cars, DUEWAG (owned by Siemens, later merged into the mother company) the middle cars, Siemens supplied the electronics and other main parts, and Fiat Ferroviaria (later bought by Alstom) supplied the bogies and the tilting technology.
The tilting technology is a hydraulic actuator system based on that of the Italian ETR 460 and ETR 470 second-generation Pendolino trains. In Pendolino bogies, only one axle is driven. In class 411 and class 415 motor cars, the inside axle of both bogies is motorised (configuration (1A)'(A1)').
After the German government abandoned the project of a Transrapid (maglev) line between Hamburg and Berlin, Deutsche Bahn decided to upgrade its conventional line between the two cities to 230 km/h. To serve this line and increase capacity on other lines, in 2002 DB ordered an additional 28 seven-car trains from a consortium consisting of the successors of the companies in the previous one, but this time led by Siemens. This brought the total number of Class 411 trains to 60. The main changes were aimed at reducing costs.
Class 411.
The second (411.1), third (411.2), fifth (411.7) and sixth (411.6) cars are motorised, while the end cars (411.0 and 411.5) carry transformers supplying the next two cars. Thus each train consists of two power units of three coaches plus one unpowered middle car (411.8). The middle car can be removed, and theoretically the trains can be supplemented with an additional middle car.
Class 415.
Each five-car train forms a single power unit, with three motorised middle cars (415.1, 415.7, 415.6) between two end cars (415.0, 415.5) carrying transformers.
Six trains are intended for domestic service, the other five (car numbers 415 x80-415 x84) for international service towards Switzerland, therefore they were also equipped with the Swiss train safety system and additional narrower pantographs for the Swiss network.
The first class 415 train was assembled in the summer of 1998, when testing began. Trials with the activated tilting system started in October 1998. Software errors delayed the commissioning. The first class 411 was delivered in early 1999.
Shortly before entering service, the product name of the trains was changed to "ICE T", with "T" now standing for the English word "tilt(ing)". (At the same time, the ICT VT became the ICE TD.)
Service history.
Class 415 entered service on 31 May 1999 between Stuttgart and Zurich. Class 411 entered service on 19 December 1999 between Berlin and Düsseldorf via Magdeburg. Later, the Berlin-Munich and Frankfurt-Leipzig-Dresden routes were added.
On 6 January 2004, one unit (with cars numbered 411 x06) burnt out. Only the end cars remained intact, and have been used as temporary replacements for damaged end cars of other units.
Starting in December 2004, DB took the second batch of 28 more class 411 units into service on the upgraded line between Berlin and Hamburg. This was the first time the ICE T reached its top speed of 230 km/h in regular service. DB accepted the additional trains only after they proved themselves reliable in service, with all trains delivered by the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The trains were delivered with a standing bar in place of a restaurant; however, from 2007, all have been rebuilt with a restaurant.
Most trains have been assigned city names.
When the capacity of the Switzerland-enabled five-car trains became too low for the Stuttgart-Zürich services, in 2006 the class 415 end cars (which carry the pantographs and the train safety equipment) were switched with that of class 411 trains, thus forming seven-car trains suitable for services to Switzerland.
From the timetable change at the end of 2007, 15 class 411 trains modified for service in Austria (three of them sold to the Austrian Federal Railways, see section ÖBB Class 4011 below) connect Frankfurt and Vienna every two hours. Some of these trains come from Dortmund and go via Frankfurt to Vienna.
Service disruption.
On 24 October 2008, DB temporarily removed all ICE-T trains from service after a crack was found in an axle of one of the company's fleet of trains. All the trains were to be inspected for similar cracks and repaired as necessary before DB returned them to service. DB decided to sideline the trains after consultation with Siemens, Bombardier and Alstom revealed only "unclear information" about the expected life span of the axles.
At the start of November 2008, a quarter of the trains were back in service. The ultrasonic tests progressed at a speed of two trains a week, with tests on all trains expected to be finished by February 2009. Until the reason for the axle breaks is identified, the checked trains are operated with deactivated tilting system.
In January 2009, Deutsche Bahn CEO Hartmut Mehdorn suggested that the axles would have to be replaced with a new design. Development, production and installation of the new axles would take up to two years.

Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd

Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1989/5.html EWCA Civ 5 is a leading English contract law case, which decided that in varying a contract, the court will be quick to find consideration, if "factual benefits" are given from one to another party.
Facts.
Roffey Bros was contracted by Shepherds Bush Housing Association Ltd to refurbish 27 flats at Twynholm Mansions, Lillie Road, London SW6. They subcontracted carpentry to Mr Lester Williams for £20,000 payable in instalments. Some work was done and £16,200 was paid. Then Williams ran into financial difficulty because the price was too low. Roffey Bros was going to be liable under a penalty clause for late completion, so they had a meeting on 9 April 1986 and promised an extra £575 per flat for on time completion. Williams did eight flats and stopped because he had only got £1,500. New carpenters were brought in. Williams claimed.
Mr Rupert Jackson QC held Williams should get the eight times £575 with a few deductions for defects and some of the £2,200 owing from the original sum. He said that they had agreed that the original price was too low, and that raising it to a reasonable level was in both sides’ interests.
Judgment.
Glidewell LJ held Williams had provided good consideration even though he was merely performing a pre-existing duty. Williams got £3,500 (not full expectation damages). He said that the idea of promissory estoppel was not properly argued and ‘not yet been fully developed’. The concept of economic duress provided an answer to Stilk’s old problem. The test for understanding whether a contract could legitimately be varied was set out as follows.
The practical benefit of timely completion, even though a pre-existing duty is performed, constitutes good consideration. On "Stilk v Myrick", Glidewell LJ said,
However, the principle had not in fact been subjected to any refinement and the three cases he relied on for this proposition - "Ward", "Williams v Williams" and "Pao On" - unanimously applied it by finding legal consideration (without which the post-contractual modifications would not have been upheld). 
Glidewell LJ expanded that this test merely refined the "Stilk v Myrick" principle further but left it unscathed. This is inaccurate as he held that other practical benefits than those envisaged as the original consideration may "per se" constitute the requisite good consideration to fulfil the contract (something "Stilk v Myrick" specifically did not allow). The two cases would until then have been seen as indistinguishable on their facts. or whether he overruled the High Court precedent (later relied on in more senior courts) of Stilk v Myrick.
Russell LJ, giving his own interpretation in the plaintiff's favour held: He noted that Roffey Bros’ employee, Mr Cottrell had felt the original price to be less than reasonable, and there was a further need to replace the ‘haphazard method of payment by a more formalised scheme’ of money per flat. "True it was that the plaintiff did not undertake to do any work additional to that which he had originally undertaken to do but the terms upon which he was to carry out the work were varied and, in my judgment, that variation was supported by consideration which a pragmatic approach to the true relationship between the parties readily demonstrates."
Purchas LJ concurred with Glidewell LJ.

Aneroid Lake

Aneroid Lake is a large tarn located on Aneroid Mountain in the Eagle Cap Wilderness of Northeastern Oregon. It is situated in between Roger Lake and Dollar Lake. It is not accessible by any kind of motor vehicle. However, there is a popular hiking trail that leads to the lake. There is a small group of private cabins near the south end and Pete's Point is clearly visible from the lake. It ties with Laverty Lake as the twenty-third highest lake in the Eagle Cap Wilderness at . 
Cross-country skiing.
Being surrounded by slopes that are typically covered in snow as early as October, Aneroid lake has become a popular cross-country skiing destination. Guided tours are available, some tours utilize the cabins at the lake. 
Fatalities.
The area is known for unexpected avalanches, which at times have caused fatalities. One of the earliest avalanche caused fatalities on record that occurred at Aneroid Lake was on February 14, 1981, when an avalanche killed one skier near the lake. Through not a single avalanche-related death had occurred at lake since 1981, on March 7, 2009, a 50-year-old skier was killed near the lake. Roger T. Roepke, his 15-year-old son, and 48-year-old Don Woodhouse were part of a group who was skiing about one half mile above the Aneroid Lake cabins when a quarter-mile-long slab avalanche occurred, burying the three skiers. The avalanche began at about 1 p.m. and slid approximately before the run-out. It received a 3.5 danger scale rating by the American Avalanche Association. Don Woodhouse and the 15-year-old Roepke survived the event. However, after 30 minutes of CPR and other life saving measures, Roger Roepke was considered dead.
SNOTEL.
One half mile east of Aneroid Lake is "Aneroid Lake Snotel #2", which is one of the two SNOTELs in the Eagle Cap mountains. It measures the depth of the snow, the amount of water content in the snow, general precipitation, and air temperature. It is operated by the Natural Resources Conservation Service and was installed in 1982.
Trail.
Aneroid Lake can be accessed by either the East Fork Wallowa River Trailhead at Wallowa Lake or Tenderfoot Trailhead. The East Fork Wallowa River Trailhead is by far a shorter hike to Aneroid Lake, being only long. It begins at the south end of Wallowa Lake, near Wallowa Lake State Park. After about of hiking on the East Fork Wallowa River Trail, the climber will reach a small dam. At there is a small, well built bridge. At lies Roger Lake. The trail is usually well maintained. It may be heavily traveled in the summer months.

William Henry Pferinger Elkins

Major General William Henry Pferinger Elkins (1883–1964) was a Canadian soldier. He was a Commandant of the RMC.
Education.
624 Major General William Henry Pferinger Elkins was born on 13 June 1883 at Sherbrooke, Quebec. He graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in June 1905.
Career.
He was commissioned in the Royal Canadian Artillery; his first posting was to “B” Battery, RCHA. He served with “N” Battery, RHA in India from 1908 to 1910, and while on the sub-continent completed his Captain qualifying examination. 
He served as Commanding Officer RCHA Brigade 1916 – 1922. In December 1917, he was evacuated due to illness and convalesced at the Prince of Wales Hospital for Officers at Marylebone, England. He returned to duty with the Brigade in time for the German Offensive in the Spring of 1918. Lieutenant-Colonel Elkins controlled the movement and deployment of his own two batteries as well as twelve additionally assigned batteries. He withdrew more than fifty-six kilometers in ten days while under constant enemy pressure. A command of this size was normally a job for a Brigadier with a sizeable staff. In October 1918, a Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery Battery along with “I” and “N” Batteries, Royal Horse Artillery were placed under his command. In an operation supporting an attack on the high ground north of Montay, France the Canadians advanced eight miles on a front of more than three miles, to 400 prisoners and captured a large number of enemy weapons. This action earned Lieutenant-Colonel Elkins a Bar to his DSO.
Lieutenant-Colonel Elkins and his Brigade returned to their usual peacetime duties of training the militia; he continued in command until 1922 when he was appointed Commandant Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, Halifax, Nova Scotia. Other successive appointments were Camp Commandant Petawawa, another short term as Commander of the RCHA Brigade and Chairman of the Standing Arms Committee. He was promoted Colonel in 1925. 
On his subsequent promotion to Brigadier General in 1930, he was appointed to command the Royal Military College of Canada, a post he held until 1935. He was concerned that cadets were prioritizing sports during the games season to the detriment of their studies. He introduced an academic eligibility rule in 1931-2 for participation in hockey and football. He divided the cadet battalion into 6 companies instead of 2 to enable greater participation in intramural sports. He stepped up intramural hockey and Canadian football - increasing the number of games and the number of participants. RMC aims were to produce officers and engineers, and to provide a general and cultural education. In 1932, the competition to enter RMC was particularly hot, perhaps a consequence of the Great Depression. Since many recruits had qualifications higher than junior matriculation, they repeated work they had done before and risked becoming bored. Consequently, some elementary science work was dropped in favour of advanced studies in imperial geography, military history and economics. Many parents preferred that their sons prepare for careers in law, accounting or business to engineering. During the construction and industrial growth slump in the Great Depression, engineers found it hard to find employment. In 1932, Elkins disciplined and demoted a BSM to Corporal for recruiting/hazing “conducting physical training exercises… in the dormitory” contrary to orders.
He served as District Officer Commanding 2nd Military District 1935 – 1938. He was Master-General of Ordnance, National Defence Headquarters 1938 – 1940. He served as General Officer Commander in Chief Atlantic Command 1940 – 1943. He retired in 1944. He died in 1964.
Honours.
Major-General Elkins was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) on 1 January 1935 and in November 1938 was appointed Master General of Ordnance. In 1943 he was appointed as Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).
Legacy.
The Elkins piano room at the Royal Artillery (RA) Park Officers Mess in Halifax, Nova Scotia was named in his honour.

Local mail and rayon stamps of Switzerland

The local mail and rayon stamps of 1850 and 1852 constituted the first series of postage stamps issued by the Swiss Post. In philately, they are among the most sought-after Swiss stamps, with a 5 rappen "Rayon I" stamp selling for the record price of CHF 348,000 (USD 293,000) at auction in 2008.
After the reconstitution of Switzerland as a federal state in 1848, the authority to operate a postal service passed from the cantons to the Confederation, and the federal postal service was founded in 1849. Its local mail and rayon stamps were the first definitive stamps valid in all of Switzerland, although the stamps issued by the postal authorities of the cantons of Geneva, Basel-Stadt and Zürich remained concurrently valid until 1854, when all stamps were supplanted by the "Sitting Helvetia" series of federal stamps.
Rayons.
The first Swiss postal regulations divided Switzerland, for the purpose of mailing letters weighing no more than half a lot, into four "rayons". These were defined by the distance or road transport time (whichever was higher) between sender and recipient. A special, lower rate applied to letters mailed within a municipality. Rayon IV, defined by a distance of more than 192 km or a transport time of more than 40 hours, for which a postage of 20 Rappen was due, was abandoned in 1852 and became part of Rayon III. No stamps were ever issued for it.
Stamp design.
The stamps depict a bugle atop the Swiss coat of arms. They are labeled with their denomination and with the corresponding rayon or, as the case may be, as stamps for local mail. All stamps were issued in German and French, with the French versions substituting "cts." for "Rp." and "Poste locale" for "Orts-Post". They were printed lithographically on imperforate white paper.

Mayabeque River

Mayabeque River (alternately "Rio Mayabeque") is a river of western Cuba, considered the largest in the southwestern watershed of Cuba, with an extensive fluvial network that encompasses the municipalities of Güines, San Jose de las Lajas, Jaruco, Madruga, and Melena del Sur. The old outlet in Melena del Sur (now connected with the main river only by irrigation canals) is named "Antiguo Mayabeque". The "Antiguo" (ancient) Mayabeque is still navigable by small boats in the last .
Mayabeque was the largest river in the former province of Havana, and presently (2011) is the main river of the Mayabeque Province, named after the river. It runs from north to south and on its banks is the important and historic city of Güines. Its cold waters are a source of satisfaction for bathers in the summer time, ending at the shores of Mayabeque Beach in Melena del Sur.
Vegetation.
Among the plants that grow on the banks of the river you can find plenty of trees and shrubs of different species as the mangrove which gives a remarkable average color red to its waters.
History.
The earliest mention of river data Mayabeque 1509, just 17 years after the discovery of Cuba, where some Indians had been referred to the father Houses in a place farther west from where it was Panfilo de Narvaez with their archers, the people were Indian in which they were captives, some Spanish people, two women and one man. It is believed that the original Havana (San Cristóbal de La Habana) village was founded in 1514 or 1515 on the banks of the Mayabeque (most likely on the "Antiguo Mayabeque") a few kilometers from the south coast.
Mayabeque National Camp School.
In 1956, under the leadership of Serafín García Menocal, president of the "Consejo Nacional Scouts de Cuba" (National Council), the Scouts of Cuba bought the national training grounds "Campo Escuela Nacional Mayabeque" near Catalina de Güines within of the capital. The National Camp School was dedicated to the training of Scouters and for Scout camping. The Field School was abandoned in 1961, and at the moment is under the water of Pedroso reservoir.

Henry Barraud

Henry Barraud (sometimes "Henri") (23 April 1900 – 28 December 1997) was a French composer.
He was born in Bordeaux. He was a student of Louis Aubert at the Conservatoire de Paris, but in 1927 failed to graduate, apparently because of his refusal to follow orthodox methods. Along with Pierre-Octave Ferroud and Jean Rivier, he helped to form the society "Triton" for the wider distribution of contemporary music.
After the Liberation of Paris in 1944, he was named the Director of Paris Radio, and later, in 1948, of what later became ORTF, a position he held until his retirement in 1965.
Works.
As a composer, Barraud contributed to opera, ballet, orchestral music, chamber music, choral and vocal music.
OPERA
ORATORIO
Paul Paray and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra recorded Barraud's orchestral work "Offrande à une ombre" in 1957 for Mercury Records. This wartime memorial, commemorating the death during combat of Maurice Jaubert at the age of 40, was initially released on LP in monophonic sound; the stereophonic version was issued on CD by Philips Records. A work listed as Symphony #1 for full orchestra (not just strings) was recorded on French Columbia FCX 597 (LP) performed by Georges Tzipine leading the ORTF. Its three movements are entitled Overture, Nocturne, and Interludes Dramatiques.

Thor-Christian Ebbesvik

Thor–Christian Ebbesvik (born 17 December 1983 in Bergen) is a professional racing driver from Norway.
Career.
Formula Ford.
Ebbesvik began his racing career in 2005, driving for Team JLR in the British Formula Ford Championship. He finished the year in sixth place and also took part in the end–of–season Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch, where he failed to finish. He continued in the series in 2006, improving to fourth place in the championship. He took four podium finishes during the season, including a win at Thruxton. He again took part in the Formula Ford Festival, this time competing in the Duratec class, but once again retired from the race.
Formula Three.
In 2007, Ebbesvik moved up to Formula Three, competing in the Spanish championship for the British outfit Team West–Tec. He was entered into the secondary Copa de España class, which featured older–generation Dallara chassis. At the end of the season, he finished tied on points with Peruvian driver Juan Manuel Polar, but took the title by virtue of taking more second places than Polar after they scored seven class wins each.
For 2008, he remained with Team West–Tec in Spanish Formula Three, beginning the year with a Dallara F306 chassis before switching to a newer F308 model after the first two rounds of the season. In August of that year, Ebbesvik dominated the most prestigious race of the season to win on the Valencia Street Circuit, with the race acting as a support event for the Formula One . He took a further race win at Jerez in October to finish the championship in tenth place, one position ahead of team–mate Jonathan Legris.
Ebbesvik continued in the championship for a third year in 2009, when the series was renamed as the European F3 Open Championship. He finished the season in fifth place, taking a single victory at Donington Park with further podium places at Magny–Cours and Monza.
Formula Le Mans Cup.
In May 2009, Ebbesvik contested the opening two races of the new Formula Le Mans Cup at Spa–Francorchamps. Sharing an Oreca FLM09 with Swiss driver Christophe Pillon, he finished both races in fifth position.
Le Mans Series.
Ebbesvik made a full-time switch from single–seaters to sportscar racing in 2010, racing for Team Bruichladdich in the LMP2 class of the Le Mans Series and Le Mans 24 Hours, sharing a Ginetta–Zytek GZ09SB/2 with Tim Greaves and Karim Ojjeh. In the second event of the season, the Spa 1000 km, Ebbesvik was injured after an accident involving a slower GT car, sustaining a fractured vertebra which subsequently ruled him out of the following month's Le Mans 24 Hours. Two overall fifth–place finishes, including anchoring the team to its best ever podium position in LMP2, at the following two rounds in Portimão and Hungaroring ensured that he finished the year in fifth position in the LMP2 standings. Indeed at the season finale at Silverstone, Ebbesvik managed to take the Zytek into the LMP2 lead for the first time ever, although the car was subsequently crashed by Ojjeh.
Ebbesvik was due to continue with the team in 2011, competing alongside Ojjeh and team newcomer Gary Chalandon, but was surprisingly and unexpectedly replaced by Tom Kimber–Smith a few weeks before the start of the season. He did, however, sign a last–minute deal to race in the season–opening event at Paul Ricard, where he finished 10th overall in an LMP2 class Oreca 03–Judd entered by Race Performance.
For the second round of the season, the Spa 1000 km, Ebbesvik was set to graduate to the premier LMP1 class, racing a Lola–Judd for the Guess Racing Europ team, but the entry was withdrawn as the car would not be ready in time for the event.
For the final two rounds of the 2011 Le Mans Series, Ebbesvik signed to Boutsen Energy to lead their LMP2 campaign, replacing their previous pro driver, Nicolas de Crem, in the team's Oreca 03-Nissan.
Other series.
In September 2007, Ebbesvik became the first ever Norwegian to drive a GP2 car when he tested for Racing Engineering at the Jerez circuit. The following year, he once again took part in GP2 series testing, driving for Racing Engineering, Arden International, DAMS and Fisichella Motor Sport at both Paul Ricard and Jerez. He had intended to race in GP2 in 2009, but could not find the required budget to compete. In November 2008, Ebbesvik also took part in Formula Renault 3.5 Series testing, driving for both Comtec Racing and Fortec Motorsport in Valencia.

But the catch is, she is a part-time Baccarat dealer and a full-time cabaret dancer, “careers” not exactly congruent with his station in life. Fallen in love against all odds, this mismatched couple soon makes headline in all media which turn Milan into an It girl overnight.
Production.
"Look for a Star" is a Hong Kong and Chinese co-production that marks the sixth collaboration between producer, director, and cinematographer Andrew Lau and Cantopop singer and actor Andy Lau. It is also the second film collaboration between Andy Lau and actress Shu Qi. Both actors and the director worked together on the 2002 science fiction film "The Wesley's Mysterious File", although Andy Lau had expressed wanting to make a romantic comedy with Shu. 
"Look for a Star" was distributed by Media Asia Entertainment Group in Hong Kong and produced by Media Asia, Chinese film studio Huayi Brothers, and Andrew Lau's production company, Basic Pictures. Shot under a budget of HK$45 million, the film is reportedly based on the relationship between casino tycoon Stanley Ho and his fourth wife, Angela Leong.
Filming.
"Look for a Star" was supported by the Macau Government Tourist Office, and shot at the MGM Grand Macau, best known for its spectacular Grande Praca swimming pool and deluxe villa suites. Other filming locations included Macau's Southern European architecture, including the Old Ladies House, the Guia Lighthouse and the Coloane village.

Katedra (band)

Katedra ("Cathedral" in English) is a Lithuanian Heavy Metal band, founded in 1986. 
From the outset, it was significantly influenced by the style of Iron Maiden.
History.
Beginning.
In its first incarnation, Katedra was composed of the three musicians: Ričardas Laginauskas on guitar, Algimantas Radavičius on bass, and Marius Giedrys on drums. Later, former Foje guitarist Romas Rainys and even then-unknown vocalist Povilas Meškėla joined the band. December 1986 was the official start of Katedra.
"Mors Ultima Ratio" and break up.
In 1989 band finished recording their first LP called "Mors Ultima Ratio" (Latin: "Death is the final accounting"). Although, it was released a year after recording, Katedra's first vinyl album gained extreme popularity in Lithuania. "Mors Ultima Ratio" was also noticed by Edgar Klusener from "Metal Hammer" magazine. He described Katedra as: "that is pure thrash metal act, strong both musically and technically. In fact the formation is superior in comparison with 90 percent of similar Western acts. So it is evident how far the music in Lithuania made headway. Katedra are the only matadors in Lithuania and maybe stand among the hottest European thrash metal bands". Gained popularity, opened doors to concerts abroad. In 1991 Katedra played at "Baltic Sea Music Festival" in Sweden. Unfortunately, it was the last gig for Povilas Meškėla and Romas Rainys with the band. Soon after the festival they left Katedra.
Downturn.
The band was now seeking another shift: Ričardas took over the vocalist position. The band's output at this time included the album "Natus in articulo mortis"; their music became more severe; and Ričardas's vocal entry of the Katedra sounds from the standard clichés. The trio played many concerts and their albums were played on Lithuanian radio stations.
Later, and for some time, concert activity was stopped. Although the trio continued to build and perform together, the group's name was almost forgotten. It was a new generation, and new names appeared on the Metal stage. In February 2001, the band was invited to play an acoustic concert on Lithuanian national television. The group relied on its own feet—and played live.
Revival.
From 2003 the band helped keyboardist Naglis Patamsis. The musicians tried to experiment more. In the autumn of 2003, longtime band member Marius Giedrys left Katedra. He was replaced by a new drummer, Domas Dėdinas (who has played in bands such as Inquest, Undertaker, Dahmer, Mezopsychya and Herosgamos). 
After a successful appearance at Lithuania's largest rock festival "The nights of rock 2004" in Plateliai, managers found Katedra and booked the band for a few concert programs, which have been shown with success in Lithuanian club music scenes, and also in several foreign festivals. 
In the 2005 summer festival "The nights of rock 2005", Katedra presented a retrospective of its old and new songs with the string duo Gleb Pyšniak (cello) and Kristina Baltrušaitytė (viola). 
In August 2004, the band announced its third album (and first album on CD format) "III". It was presented in 2006 "The nights of rock". 
2006 Band bassist Algis Radavičius was replaced by Gediminas Jurgaitis (previously, he had played in the band "Hersh You"? 
At the end of 2007, Domas Dėdinas was replaced by Salvijus Žeimys (ex "Ossuary", "Spellbound", "Green Bridge Band" and others), who also performs with bands "Skylė", "Atalyja" and "ExLibris".
In September 2008, the group signed a contract with Atra Musica for a fourth album, "Ugnikalnis" (Lithuanian: Volcano) 
On November 1, 2008, the band's fourth album, "Ugnikalnis", saw the light of day.
In the end of 2010 Gediminas Jurgaitis left the band. Bass players place was taken by Rimantas Budriūnas.

Hallsteinn Sigurðsson

Hallsteinn Sigurðsson (born 1945) is an Icelandic sculptor and visual artist. He is noted for his Nordic god sculptures, some of which are located at the Laxá Power Station in the north central part of the country and are arranged in the facility’s tunnels and vaults. Some twenty five of his sculptures are exhibited in the Gufunes sculpture park in north-east Reykjavík.
Biography.
Hallsteinn Sigurðsson was born in 1945 and studied at the School of Arts and Crafts in Iceland from 1963 to 1966, then went to the United Kingdom, where he studied sculpture at the Hornsey College of Art, London (1966–1967), Hammersmith College of Art, London (1967–1969) and the St. Martin’s School of Art, London (1969–1972). In London he was influenced by the work of Anthony Caro and other "New Generation" sculptors. After completing his studies in London, he made study trips to Italy, Greece and the United States.
Hallsteinn held more than a dozen solo exhibitions in the years 1971 to 1997, and has been hired to create monuments for various organizations and municipalities in Iceland. Early in his career, Hallsteinn created sculpture cast from concrete and various plastics. In his more recent works, Hallsteinn most often uses aluminium and iron alloy, generally in abstract and geometric forms. Over time his structures have become lighter in form. Dozens of his works are in public ownership, and his works are represented in the collections of museums including the Borgarness Museum, Icelandic National Gallery and Reykjavík Art Museum in Reykjavík, where he resides. Some twenty-five of his sculptures are exhibited in the Gufunes sculpture park in northeast Reykjavík. Hallsteinn is a member of the Icelandic Sculptors Society, which he established in the Icelandic capital in 1972 along with Jon Gunnar Árnason, Ragnar Kjartansson, Þorbjörg Pálsdóttir and others. He is also a member of the Icelandic Association of Visual Artists. In 2002 a set of his sculptures based on Nordic mythology was installed in the tunnels and vaults of the Laxárvirkjun hydroelectric power station in north-central Iceland, where the works can be seen by visitors each summer. In 2006 he exhibited at the Sigurjón Ólafsson Museum with a collection named "Wheel-Plow-Wings".

Illegal was a short-lived hip hop duo composed of Jamal Phillips (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and Malik Edwards (Holly Hill, South Carolina) that was signed to Rowdy Records. The duo was known to be affiliated with the hip-hop collective Hit Squad, made their debut with the album, "The Untold Truth", released in 1993, which became a minor success, peaking at #119 on the Billboard 200 and #19 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Several tracks on the album, including its two singles, "Head or Gut" and "We Getz Busy," were diss songs directly aimed at rivals Kris Kross and Da Youngstas. The duo virtually disappeared from the public eye until 1995, when it teamed with Too Short on the song "Thangs Change," after which the group disbanded. Jamal Phillips would later release his debut solo album, "Last Chance, No Breaks", in 1995 on Rowdy Records. Malik released one single for Rowdy Records titled "Malik Goes On," but his debut album was shelved.

Anglia Regional Co-operative Society

Anglia Regional Co-operative Society Limited was the fifth largest consumer co-operative in the United Kingdom. It was formed by the merger of the Greater Peterborough Regional (formerly Peterborough and District) and Anglia (formerly Waveney) Co-operative Societies in 1987. The Society had a wide-ranging and extensive portfolio with over 80 stores, principally trading in East Anglia. Previously located at Westgate House, head office re-located to Burch House, Peterborough in 2011.
The Society was a registered Industrial and Provident Society, a member of the Co-operative Union Ltd., the Co-operative Retail Trading Group and a corporate member of Co-operative Group Ltd. (formerly Co-operative Wholesale Society), the largest consumer co-operative in the world.
On 19 September 2013, it was announced that the boards of Anglia Co-operative Society and Midlands Co-operative Society had agreed merger terms. Approved by members on 4 and 18 November, legal completion of the merger took place on 1 December, with the Society transferring engagements to Midlands Co-operative. On 15 January 2014, members of the merged society approved a change of name to Central England Co-operative effective from 25 January 2014. 
Trading.
Under its rules, “The objects of the Society are to carry on the business of a store-keeper, general dealer and universal provider in all its branches, and in particular to buy, sell, manufacture, produce, grow, cultivate and deal in goods, stores, consumable articles, chattels and effects of all kinds, both wholesale and retail and generally to engage in any business, trade or industry which may seem to the Society directly or indirectly conducive to the interests or convenience of the Society's members or any section thereof.” In addition, the aims stated, “The Society shall at all times conduct its business and affairs in accordance with the Rochdale Principles of Co-operation, as published from time to time by the International Co-operative Alliance, serving the needs of its customers, employees and the communities in which it trades.” In practice, the Society’s principal undertakings at the time of merger with the Midlands Society, besides food and fuel retail, comprised the provision of funeral, optical, travel and foreign exchange services. Its previous engagements include department and furniture stores, motor car dealerships, dispensing chemists, dairy and bakery.
In 2004, United Co-operatives Ltd., based in the North West of England, announced that it no longer intended to include department stores in its primary strategy, leading to the sale of seven stores, mostly inherited from the Yorkshire Co-operative Society, to the Anglia Society. In 2005, the Co-operative Group also announced its decision to exit the department store sector and, in 2006, a further seven stores, this time located in the South East of England, were transferred to the Anglia Society. The Group subsequently merged with United in 2007. Thus, through acquisition, many Westgate branches were situated further afield than the core Eastern region.
In 2007, the Society—by now the largest in the non-food sector—formed the Anglia Buying Service, making its buying and logistics expertise available to other co-operatives. In 2008, it launched an electronic commerce venture, selling bedroom, living and dining room furniture, with free delivery throughout Great Britain.
In 2011, the business of 19 Westgate Department Stores, including Contact Electrical and Comfortmaker Textile Superstores was divested to J E Beale Plc for £7.5m. Ownership of the freehold properties remains with the Society, which will continue to operate AHF furniture and carpets, Co-operative Travel, Westgate Optical and Stylistics hair and beauty concessions; Beales committed to maintain and honour the dividend at these branches, until replaced by their Love Rewards scheme the following year. The Co-operative Home store in Hartlepool and Westgate stores at Blyth, Scunthorpe and March were not included in the sale. The site of the March store was sold to Reef Estates Ltd. and the premises leased to W Boyes & Co Ltd., although the Co-operative Travel branch previously based there was unaffected, relocating to its own premises. The Hartlepool store closed when the Society's 10-year lease expired later that year. The Blyth and Scunthorpe stores continued to trade as Westgate for the time being due to devalued freehold and a long running lease, although it was reported that management were “reviewing the format and pursuing any opportunities that give the stores and the staff the best prospects for the future.” A buyer was eventually found for the Blyth store, but not as a going concern and it ceased trading in 2013.
Later in 2011, AHF Home Furnishings was transferred to Anglia Home Furnishings Ltd. as a going concern. A partner of the Society, Anglia Home Furnishings Holdings Ltd. is the largest employee-owned co-operative in the UK. The sale included ARCS Internet Ltd. trading as Co-op Furniture, the online store of AHF and Westgate, which has since been renamed AHF Internet Ltd.
Membership.
Co-operative societies are owned and controlled by their members on the principle of one member one vote and the Anglia Society operated on that basis, giving all members equal voting rights. Each member was required to hold at least one share of £1 which was paid in full on entering the Society. Organisations were also eligible to join. Agreed by the membership, the Society's rules provided for a board of ten, three of whom may have been employees of the Society, to be elected by the annual general meeting. The full board met monthly and sub-committees met quarterly or less frequently.
Dividend is a share of the profits made by the Society. The rate of dividend was recommended to members by the board of directors and put to a vote. Members had an opportunity at the point of sale to donate their dividend to the Anglia Co-operative Community Fund (Share 600), the proceeds of which were presented each year to three or four charities nominated by the board. It was paid annually and a warrant placed in the share account wallet on receipt.
The Co-operative Group relaunched its own membership scheme in 2006. In 2008, the Anglia Society joined the new scheme under a reciprocal arrangement. The Society began allocating dividend through the card scheme, which members were able to use nationally at participating societies. This included food purchases, on which the Society had not previously paid dividend. A new rule book based on Co-operativesUK 12th edition model rules was approved by the membership and registered with the Financial Services Authority in 2009. The Midlands Society also operated the membership scheme and similar arrangements continue with Central England Co-operative.
Anglia Regional Co-operative Party operates in Peterborough and west Norfolk.
Subsidiaries.
In 2008, Rainbow supermarkets and Co-op Local stores began the process of re-branding as The Co-operative Food whilst remaining part of the Anglia Co-operative Society. In 2011, adjacent petrol filling stations, previously supplied by Shell, moved across to Total, aligning buying with the Co-operative Retail Trading Group. The Co-operative Travel at Anglia Co-operative Society was a trading name of the Freedom Travel Group which, in 2012, became part of the Thomas Cook Group.
The Anglia Co-operative Funeral group incorporates R J Scholes (Bourne, Deeping St. James and Stamford), Harvey Brothers (Bungay), J H Landin & Son (Chatteris), A Coley & Son (Crowland), George James & Son (March), Watkins & Stafford (Peterborough), Dennis Easton (St. Ives), Fishers (Southwald), H E Bull & Son (Whittlesey) and M J Claypole (Yaxley) funeral directors. At the time of merger, the way the Society marketed its funeral business and the prominence of the Anglia Co-operative brand on private name funeral homes was being reviewed.
Anglia Motor Group previously sold Audi, Vauxhall, Honda and Fiat in King's Lynn, Vauxhall in Wisbech and Hunstanton and Proton in Beccles. It also operated a King's Lynn bodyshop trading as Bodyline.
Since 1999, co-operative chemists in the Society's trading area are operated by National Co-operative Chemists Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of The Co-operative Group trading as The Co-operative Pharmacy. The business and assets of the former Anglia Dairies Ltd. were transferred to Dairy Crest Group Plc in 1997 for an aggregate consideration of £4.5m.
History.
The consumer co-operative movement has its roots in the early part of the nineteenth century and the principles of self-help and social equity that developed during the Victorian era. The first successful retail co-operative was established in 1844 by the Rochdale Pioneers.
The Society was founded as Peterborough Equitable Industrial Co-operative Society in 1876. It later absorbed the Oundle (est.1866), St. Neots (est.1882), Huntingdon (est.1866), Wisbech (est.1886), King's Lynn (est.1888), St. Ives (est.1889) and Chatteris (est.1900) societies, becoming the Peterborough and District Co-operative Society, then Greater Peterborough Regional Co-operative Society.
Stanley Tiffany, a director of the Society, was elected Labour Co-operative Member of Parliament for the Peterborough division of Northamptonshire at the 1945 general election.
The Anglia (formerly Waveney) Co-operative Society, which transferred engagements to the Peterborough Society in 1987, had earlier absorbed the Beccles (est.1879), Diss (est.1898) and Lowestoft (est.1890) societies.

Manalapan and Freehold Turnpike

The Manalapan and Freehold Turnpike was a turnpike in New Jersey, running west from Freehold into Manalapan Township. 
The Manalapan and Freehold Turnpike was chartered on March 18, 1863 and began at the intersection of Manalapan Avenue and West Main Street, Freehold and followed Manalapan Avenue (County Route 24), New Jersey Route 33 Business and New Jersey Route 33 to the Manalapan and Patton's Corner Turnpike (present intersection of Route 33 and Woodward Road) in Manalapan. On November 17, 1886, the Manalapan and Freehold Turnpike Company purchased the western segment of the Manalapan and Patton's Corner Turnpike, which extended the route west to Manalapanville (present intersection of Route 33 and County Route 527 Alternate). On June 12, 1901 all of the turnpike between West Main Street, Freehold and Iron Ore Road (County Route 527 Alternate), Manalapan was purchased by the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders and incorporated into the county highway system. Much of this was later included as part of New Jersey Route 7, later New Jersey Route 33.

Lee's Ferry and Lonely Dell Ranch

The Lee's Ferry and Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District includes the ranch homesteaded by Mormon pioneer John D. Lee at Lee's Ferry, Arizona, and now in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. It is notable for its association with Lee, the ferry and the ranch's extensive irrigation facilities. The district was originally designated the Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, but was expanded to include Lee's Ferry in 1997.
Lee's Ferry occupies an area on either side of the Colorado River, while Lonely Dell Ranch nearby on the west bank of Paria Canyon, leaving a space of fertile bottomland available for cultivation. The period of significance for the district extends from the 1871 arrival of the Lees to the last run of the ferry in 1928, superseded by the new Navajo Bridge.
John D. Lee.
Lee was a practicing polygamist who built cabins for two of his families at Lee's Ferry, in what became known as "Lonely Dell". Lee's ferry started service on January 11, 1873, ferrying Mormon settlers across the river. Tensions rose between the settlers and the Navajo, whose lands were being occupied by the settlers, resulting in the construction of the Lee's Ferry Fort at the crossing in 1874. No conflict arose at the ferry, so the fort became a trading post, then a residence. In 1877 Lee was executed for his role in the Mountain Meadows massacre. In 1879, the LDS Church bought the ferry rights from Emma Lee, granting the ferry service to Warren Marshall Johnson and his families. A number of structures remain in the district from the polygamist period of the Lee and Johnson families.
American Placer Corporation.
The American Placer Corporation office was established at Lee's Ferry in 1910 and abandoned the next year. In that interval, the company constructed a steamboat, the "Charles H. Spencer", named for the company's founder, to transport coal mined farther up the river to the company's amalgamation operation at Lee's Ferry. The boat, in use for one year, was docked and finally sank in a 1921 flood. Its remains are visible in the river, and it is separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 1922 the office building was re-occupied as the Lee's Ferry Post Office, but was abandoned in 1924. Another brief use came in 1931.
Irrigation.
Lee started construction of the first earthen dam on the Paria River in January 1872 and by March irrigated his first crop. By April this first dam washed out. Lee soon replaced the dam reinforced with a large base log packed with brush, rocks, and dirt. The dam was subsequently washed out and rebuilt many times over the coming years. In 1883, in order to bring water to an upper field, Warren Johnson constructed a dam on a second site higher up the Paria. By 1900, the dams were replaced with new ones made of logs and sandbags. In 1905, Irving Pierce constructed a tunnel-and-flume delivery system to replace the ditches bringing water from the upper dam to the fields. By the time Leo Weaver bought the ranch in 1935, several more dams had been washed out. Weaver's attempt to replace the dams also failed. Gus and Warren Griffin made improvements upon the system, including a stone lined ditch. Most of what exists today is related to the Griffin improvements In 1965, the consortium that owned the ranch created two holding ponds for irrigation water against the west wall of Paria canyon. In 1977, the National Park Service pumped water from the Colorado River instead of the Paria. The Park Service constructed a new holding tank near the south end of the site, at the same time removing remains of the flume system and valve platform for a trail. This system remains in use as of 1999.
Lead etching.
In January 2002 a lead plate, or scroll, was found in the Lee's Ferry Fort with an etching purporting to be by John D. Lee in 1872. It was discovered by a National Parks worker while cleaning up inside the structure, which is restricted from public access. The brief writing accused Mormon leaders Brigham Young and George A. Smith of ordering the Mountain Meadows Massacre, for which Lee was convicted and sentenced to die. Despite some evidence suggesting this is a forgery, historian Will Bagley claims it fits with the historical context and Lee's writing style. He wrote, "If the scroll is a fake, it is a good one--so good that only a few people could have pulled it off." Forensic investigator George Throckmorton, who helped crack the Mark Hofmann forgeries, examined the plate in 2003 and took samples for chemical analysis in 2007.

The 2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup was the 96th edition of the USSF's annual national soccer championship, running from June through early September.
The tournament proper features teams from the top five levels of the American Soccer Pyramid. These five levels, namely Major League Soccer, the United Soccer Leagues (First Division, Second Division, and Premier Development League), and the United States Adult Soccer Association, each have their own separate qualification process to trim their ranks down to their final eight team delegations in the months leading up to the start of the tournament proper. The eight MLS clubs receive byes into the third round, while the remaining 32 teams play in the first two round with brackets influenced by geography.
Seattle Sounders FC defeated defending-champion D.C. United 2-1 in the final at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. Both clubs had started in the MLS qualification tourney, and ended up playing 6 matches each. 
Matchdays.
Match pairings were announced on May 27.
Teams.
As in the previous tournament, forty teams qualified to the tournament. The qualifying process for MLS took the form of an eight-team play-off tournament. The top six finishers, regardless of conference, in 2008 were given six of the berths into the Third Round. The eight remaining U.S.-based clubs competed for the final two berths via a playoff.
Continuing the format of recent seasons, no qualification process was needed for USL-1 and USL-2 as each level has exactly eight U.S.-based clubs for the 2009 season. The PDL announced that four selected early season games will again double as qualifying matches, as they had in recent years. Each division received a berth, since there are eight divisions instead of the ten that existed in 2008. The qualifying process for the USASA took the form of four regional tournaments, with the two finalists in each region being awarded berths.

Movicol is a brand-name laxative manufactured by Norgine.UK
Each sachet of this medicine contains macrogol (polyethylene glycol) 3350, an iso-osmotic laxative, along with sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride and potassium chloride. Electrolytes are included to help mitigate the possibility of electrolyte imbalance and dehydration. The contents of the sachets are mixed with water to make a drink. The range of Movicol includes Movicol Junior, Movicol-Half, Movicol Chocolate and Movicol Plain. Movicol is currently the largest selling laxative in the world in value terms.
Macrogol is an inert substance that passes through the gut without being absorbed into the body. It relieves constipation because it causes the water it is taken with, to be retained in the bowel instead of being absorbed into the body. This increases the water content and volume of the stools in the bowel, making them softer and easier to pass. According to new guidelines previewed in a story at the University of Maryland, isosmotic macrogol can be used to treat constipation in Parkinson's Disease patients (it is an often-overlooked non-motor symptom).

Charles H. Spencer Hulk

The Charles H. Spencer was a steamboat that was briefly used on the Colorado River to transport coal for gold refining operations at Lee's Ferry, Arizona.
In 1910, Charles H. Spencer arrived at Lee's Ferry in search of gold hidden in the Chinle shale. The company processed the shale by creating a mud and then removing the gold deposits by mercury amalgamation, which required a steady source of power. Finding a coal seam up river, Spencer commissioned a San Francisco company, Robertson-Schultz Co., to build the paddle boat, Charles Spencer, for the American Placer Corporation. James Robertson and Herman Rosenfelt built the ship. A 110 horse-power marine boiler powered a 12' stern paddle. The various parts were manufactured in San Francisco, shipped by rail to Marysvale, Utah, and conveyed by ox-cart to the mouth of Warm Creek, where the boat was assembled. The boat averaged 5-6 tons of coal on each trip. But by the end of the summer the operation was curtailed. The boat was docked. During a flood in 1921, the boat sank in shallow water. Later the superstructure was stripped of its lumber.

He has played in a number of groups since that time, including Brave Old World, the New York Bandura Ensemble, Khevrisa, Kapelye, and also with clarinetist David Krakauer and bandurist Julian Kytasty. He is also a noted teacher of Yiddish folkdance and has worked to see dance retake its traditional place in klezmer music.
Alpert has travelled in Eastern Europe and the Americas to find older musicians, and wrote an article in "American Klezmer : its roots and offshoots" about an elderly klezmer drummer called Ben Bazyler. (readable here on Google Books.) He can also partially be credited for reviving the use of rhythm ""sekund"" fiddling in klezmer music, an important aspect of traditional klezmer string bands which had fallen out of use in the revival.
He was also musical director of the PBS special "Itzhak Perlman: In the Fiddler's House".

It proceeded east along present-day Route 33 to what is now the intersection of Route 33 and Woodward Road in Manalapan, where the turnpike turned north and followed what are now Woodward Road, Main Street and Tennent Road to the Monmouth County Plank Road. On November 17, 1886, the Manalapan and Freehold Turnpike Company purchased the western segment of the Manalapan and Patton's Corner Turnpike, which truncated the route at Woodward Road and Route 33. On July 10, 1901, the segment of turnpike within Marlboro Township was purchased by the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders and incorporated into the county highway system. It would appear that at this time the segment in Manalapan was abandoned to the township. Much of this turnpike would later be included as a part of County Route 3.

Morgan Hill Farm

Morgan Hill Farm, also known as Morgan's Fresh or Hill Farm, is a historic home located at Lusby, Calvert County, Maryland. It is a -story gable-roofed frame house of a T-shaped plan, with single exterior chimneys on each of the three exposed ends. The original building appears to have been built about 1700, with extensively remodeled in the early 19th century. In 1952 a large rear wing was added to the house. Outbuildings include a one-story log servants' quarter, a log smokehouse, and a large tobacco barn.

Andrew Henry Martin Scholtz

Andrew Henry Martin Scholtz (28 July 1923, Kimberley – 17 November 2004, Mafikeng) was a South African writer.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Andrew Henry Martin Scholtz was born on the 28 July 1923 in Kimberley, South Africa. Scholtz was the eldest of ten children. His mother was a "house mother", as he would put it and his father a sailmaker. Scholtz passed standard 5 (Grade 7) at Beaconsfield Coloured School in Kimberley, South Africa. However, he had to leave school and work in order support his family after his father broke his hip and became bedridden. His mother got him a job.
Career.
Poverty and need compelled him to join the army in October 1940. He had to present himself as being 21 although he was only 17. It was a requirement that he have a driver's license for joining the Cape Corps. He however did not have on thus joining the artillery entity. Here he is accepted as a white and concedes to this, as he puts it, "to feed his family not to be accepted as a white man". This experience has a lasting impact on him: being a soldier in a whites only battalion, he carried this secret for five years. Five years later he returned, alas, too late for as his father had passed on and after serving in Kenya, Ethiopia and Egypt. He also spent twenty months in the North of Italy as a prisoner of war before he escaped.
On the 12 June 1948 He married Gazina Ortell (Siena), the mother of his twelve (12) children, in a court in Kimberley. He worked for a while in Swaziland and Botswana, using the trade taught to him earlier in his life and settled as a building contractor in Mafikeng, South Africa (then Bophuthatswana). As a result of the Apartheid legislation he could never realise his lifelong ideal in owning a cattle farm although he could afford to acquire a farm in cash.
In 1995 Andrew Henry Martin Scholtz debuted, at the age of 75, with his debut novel Vatmaar. Although the novel has an Afrikaans mindset he writes it initially in English, in neat, fully written hardcover books before his daughter Elizabeth translates it. He worked on the story for a period of three years before sending it to Divid Phillip in Cape Town, Who then forwards it to Kwela Books (Afrikaans Publishing Company) as the story does not translate so well. Kwela Books is a newly established company with the goal of finding new talent, identify the talent and to exploit it. Annarie van der Merwe of Kwela Books expressed that it is an Afrikaans story so it should be published in Afrikaans
Scholtz wrote two more books while waiting for the publication. They were then published later. In 1996 Langsaan die vuur: vyf lewensverhale and in 1998 Afdraai: ’n kroniek van seermaak en seerkry, van vrede en verandering and Tapisserie which handles the Anglo-Boer War and its ramifications.
Marriage and children.
On the 12 June 1948 He married Gazina Ortell (Siena), the mother of his twelve (12) children, in a court in Kimberley.
Death and afterward.
On 17 November 2004 Andrew Henry Martin Scholtz died from acute asthma after spending the last two months being blind as well. Yet, he will always be remembered for VATMAAR

All Saints' Church (Sunderland, Maryland)

All Saints' Church is a historic Episcopal church located at 100 Lower Marlboro Road (near the intersection of Southern Maryland Boulevard MD 4 and Solomons Island Road MD 2), in Sunderland, Calvert County, Maryland. All Saint's Parish was one of the thirty original Anglican parishes created in 1692 to encompass the Province of Maryland. In 1693 its first parish church, a log structure, was built on an acre of land called "Kemp's Desire" donated by Thomas Hillary. This log church was expanded in 1703-1704 and repaired at least 4 times before being replaced on the same site by the present building.
Built between 1774 and 1777, the present church building is a Georgian structure of Flemish bond brick with random glazed headers. Since All Saint's Parish was part of the established church of the Province of Maryland, the published volumes of the Archives of Maryland contain pertinent documented source material on the building showing that it was built with county taxes while Thomas Claggett was the rector.
All Saints' Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
All Saints' Church is still an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland. Its current rector is the Rev. Ken Phelps, Jr.

Haslem v. Lockwood

Thomas Haslem v. William A. Lockwood, Connecticut, (1871) is an important United States case in property, tort, conversion, trover and nuisance law. 
The plaintiff directed his servants to rake abandoned horse manure into heaps that had accumulated in a public street, intending to carry it away the next day. Before he could do so, the defendant, who had no knowledge of the plaintiff's actions, found the heaps and hauled them off to his own land. The plaintiff sued the defendant in trover demanding payment for the price of the manure. The trial court held for the defendant, stating he owed nothing to the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed and the Appellate Court of Connecticut held for the plaintiff, remanding the case for a new trial. 
The manure originally belonged to the owners of the horses that dropped it. But when the owners abandoned it on the road, it became the property of the man who was first to claim it. The Court found that the best owner after the act of abandonment was the borough of Stamford, Connecticut where the manure was found. In the absence of a claim to the manure by the officials of Stamford, the plaintiff was entitled to it by reason of trover. The plaintiff was entitled to damages because the defendant had committed a conversion. The manure had not become a part of the real estate, as the defendant had argued. It remained separate and unattached to the land, and hence was not part of the fee of estate. Comparing manure to seaweed and laws in the 19th century having to do with the scraping into piles of natural things of this sort, the court held that 24 hours was a reasonable time for the defendant to wait to take the manure. That by this standard, and the fruits of his labour of raking into piles, the plaintiff was granted a new trial over the issue of damages.

A case in trover for a quantity of manure, brought before a justice of the peace and appealed by the defendant to the Court of Common Pleas for the county of Fairfield, and tried in that court, on the general issue concerning the matter of ownership of the manure before Justice Brewer.
At trial it was proved that the plaintiff employed two men to gather into heaps, on the evening of April 6, 1869, some manure that lay scattered on the ground along the side of a public highway. Most of this manure was from horses passing by. The men continued their efforts through the town of Stamford Connecticut. They started at 6 PM and by 8 PM, their efforts had resulted in eighteen heaps, which was enough to fill six cart-loads. While the heaps consisted largely of manure, there were also traces of soil, gravel and straw which are commonly seen along roadways. The defendant saw the piles the next morning. He inquired of the town warden to whom they belonged, and if he had given permission to anyone for their removal. The town warden did not know to whom the manure belonged and had not given permission to anyone for the removal. Learning this, the defendant removed the manure to his own land, where it was scattered on a field.
The plaintiff and defendant both averred that they had received permission from the warden to claim the manure. But testimony revealed that neither had any authority from any town official in Stamford for the removal. Neither plaintiff while gathering, nor the defendant while removing the heaps was interfered with or opposed by any one. The removal of the manure was calculated to improve the appearance and health of the borough. The manure was worth one dollar per cart full, six dollars in all. The plaintiff, upon learning that the defendant had taken the manure, demanded he pay six dollars. Defendant refused the demand. Neither litigant owned any of the land adjacent to the road. 
On the above facts, the plaintiff prayed the court to rule that the manure was the personal property of the owners of the horses, and had been abandoned. By piling the manure into heaps, the plaintiff claimed ownership in trover. The only person who could reasonably have a greater claim to the manure would be the owner of the land in fee, and that barring any claim by the land owner, the plaintiff was the rightful owner. 
The defendant claimed that the manure being dropped and spread out over the surface of the earth was a part of the real estate, and belonged to the owner of the fee, subject to a public easement; that the fee was either the borough of Stamford or the town of Stamford, or in the parties who owned lands adjacent; that therefore the scraping up of the manure, mixed with the soil, if real estate, did not change its nature to that of personal estate, unless it was removed, whether the plaintiff had consent of the owner of the fee or not; and that unless the heaps because personal property, the plaintiff could not maintain his action. The defendant further claimed that the plaintiff may have, indeed, turned the manure into a personal estate by the act of piling it up; but had abandoned his claim to the manure by leaving it unattended overnight and into the next day. This inattention was an abandonment of all rights to ownership of the manure. The trial court ruled adversely, and found for the defendant. The plaintiff had no property rights in the piles of manure. The plaintiff appeals this ruling to this court. 
The case is appealed to this court, with the plaintiff seeking a new trial.
Argument of the plaintiff-appellant.
Curtis and Hoyt (Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant) offered the following arguments in their brief:
(1) The manure in question was the personal property abandoned by its owners. (The owners of the horses.) 
(2) It never became a part of the real estate on which it was abandoned. 
(3) It being personal property abandoned by its owners, and lying upon the highway, and neither the owners of the fee nor the proper authorities of the town and borough having by any act of theirs shown any intention to appropriate the same, it became lawful for the plaintiff to gather it up and remove it from the highway, providing he did not commit a trespass, and removed it without objection from the owners of the land. No trespass was in fact committed. No person was interfered with the plaintiff or made any objection. The court cannot presume a trespass to have been committed. 
(4) But if the manure had become a part of the real estate, yet when it was gathered into heaps by the plaintiff it was severed from the realty and became personal estate. And being gathered without molestation from any person owning or claiming to own the land, it is to be considered as having been taken by tacit consent of such owner. 
(5) The plaintiff therefore acquired not only a valid possession, but a title by occupancy, and by having expanded labor and money upon the property. Such a title is a good legal title against every person by the true owner. 
(6) If the plaintiff had a legal title then he had the constructive possession. If he had legal possession, and only left the property for a short time intending to return and take it away, then he might maintain an action against a wrong doer for taking it away. The leaving of property for a short time, intending to return, does not constitute an abandonment. The property is still to be considered as in the possession of the plaintiff.
Argument of the defendant-respondent.
Olmstead (Counsel for the defendant-respondent), contra.
(1) The manure mixed with the dirt and ordinary scrapings of the highway, being spread out over the surface of the highway, was a part of the real estate, and belonged to the owner of the fee, subject to the public easement. 
(2) The scraping up of the manure and dirt into piles, if the same was a part of the real estate, did not change its nature to that of personal property, unless there was a severance of it from the realty by removal, (which there was not), whether the plaintiff had the consent of the owner of the fee or not, which consent it is conceded the plaintiff did not have. 
(3) Unless the scraping up of the heaps made their substance personal property, the plaintiff could not maintain his action either for trespass or trespass on the case. 
(4) In trespass de bonis asportatis, or trover, the plaintiff must have had the actual possession, or a right to the immediate possession, in order to recover. 
(5) If the manure was always personal estate, it being spread upon the surface of the earth, it was in possession of the owner of the fee, who was not the plaintiff. The scraping of it into heaps, unless it was removed, would not change the possession from the owner of the fee to the plaintiff. The plaintiff therefore never had the possession. 
(6) If the heaps were personal property the plaintiff never had any right in the property, but only mere possession, if anything, which he abandoned by leaving the same upon the public highway from 8 o’clock in the evening until 12 o’clock the next day, without leaving any notice on or about the property, or any one to exercise control over the same in his behalf.
Opinion of the court.
Opinion delivered by Judge Park.
Holding.
We therefore advise the Court of Common Pleas to grant a new trial. In this opinion the other judges concurred.
Discussion.
Careful examination of the decision of the Judge Park indicates the Connecticut Court found the argument of the defendant-respondent to be exceptionally weak in terms of the law. The idea that horse droppings abandoned along the road became a part of the real estate in fee is an interesting argument. But it was soundly rejected by the court. Even following this theory, the borough of Stamford, Connecticut would have been the new best owners of the manure. When the plaintiff-appellate began to rake the manure into neat piles for reclamation, he did it in clear sight of one or more of the officials of Stamford. Also, presumably, any citizen of the town could have observed him. No one objected to his activity, or came forward to claim superior rights to the manure. The plaintiff had "improved" what was otherwise a nuisance to the town. In this act, he also had some legal standing to claim a superior ownership to anyone else. The existing laws allowing persons who piled up seaweed to have a legitimate claim of possession for 24 hours was invoked. The court had nothing good to say about the defendant-respondent, stating he had not placed himself in an enviable light.

Zinc oxide nanorod sensor

A zinc oxide nanorod sensor or ZnO nanorod sensor is an electronic device detecting presence of certain gas or liquid molecules (e.g. NO, hydrogen, etc.) in the ambient atmosphere. The sensor exploits enhanced surface area (and thus surface activity) intrinsic to all nano-sized materials, including ZnO nanorods. Adsorption of molecules on the nanorods can be detected through variation of the nanorods properties, such as electrical conductivity, vibration frequency, mass, etc. The simplest and thus most popular way is to pass electrical current through the nanorods and observe its changes upon gas exposure.

Waitotara (New Zealand electorate)

Waitotara was a New Zealand parliamentary electorate in South Taranaki. It existed from 1881 to 1893, and again from 1978 to 1996. It was represented by four Members of Parliament.
Population centres.
The previous electoral redistribution was undertaken in 1875 for the 1875–76 election. In the six years since, New Zealand's European population had increased by 65%. In the 1881 electoral redistribution, the House of Representatives increased the number of European representatives to 91 (up from 84 since the 1875–76 election). The number of Māori electorates was held at four. The House further decided that electorates should not have more than one representative, which led to 35 new electorates being formed, including Waitotara, and two electorates that had previously been abolished to be recreated. This necessitated a major disruption to existing boundaries.
The electorate was rural, in South Taranaki. It was based on the town of Waitotara, and is north of the city of Wanganui. Its original area was bounded by and in the west, in the north, and in the east. It bordered onto the South Taranaki Bight and went around the electorate. It included the towns of Patea, Pipiriki, Raetihi, and Ohakune.
History.
The electorate existed in the 19th century from 1881 to 1893. It was represented by John Bryce from 1881 to 1887, and then by George Hutchison from 1887 to 1893.
In the 20th century the seat existed from 1978 to the introduction of MMP in 1996 and was represented by two National MPs.
At the 1996 election, the bulk of the Waitotara electorate was merged with Wanganui to create the new electorate of Whanganui, and Peter Gresham was defeated by the Wanganui incumbent, Jill Pettis of the Labour Party. Gresham remained in Parliament as a list MP but retired in 1999.
Election results.
Waitotara was represented by four Members of Parliament.

The term "cross-disciplinary research" had a storybook meaning for Poon and Materials Science Professor Gary Shiflet who was also cited in the Scientific American 50 leaders. When they first met in 1985, they merely had a common interest in "quasi crystals," materials that have an unusual atomic structure. It turned out that Shiflet was holding on to a library textbook on phase transformation, which Poon needed for his teaching reference. They resolved the situation through collaboration, an approach they have continued ever since.

The Merrill-Cazier Library is an academic library serving the students of Utah State University and the community of Logan, Utah.
Motto and Mission.
The Merrill-Cazier Library's motto, "With all thy getting, get understanding.", can be seen at the entrance of the library.
The Merrill-Cazier Library connects people with information. Serving the University community, the Library is dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. We support inquiry, discovery, and engagement by providing access to quality resources, and by facilitating the use of information in teaching, learning, and research.
History.
The Merrill-Cazier Library opened its doors in September 2005. The building integrated the Cazier Science and Technology Library with a expansion, replacing the 74-year-old Merrill Library. The library is named for Milton R. Merrill, former Utah State University vice president, and Stanford Cazier, former Utah State University president.
The original Merrill Library was built in 1930 by the Whitmeyer Company of Ogden, Utah and expanded in 1967. A second library, the Cazier Science and Technology Library, was added to campus in 1995.
The Merrill-Cazier Library recently marked its 100th anniversary as a regional United States Government document depository.
The Building.
A central atrium connects the former Cazier Science and Technology library with the new construction allowing the two to work as one. The library is , about the same as the previous two libraries combined, using technological innovations, the new library is a more functional building.
Recently ranked number one "Smart Library" in the nation by "Campus Technology" magazine, the Merrill-Cazier Library offers a technology-rich environment with radio frequency identification tags (RFID), a self check-out system, an on site automated retrieval system, the Information Commons consisting of 150 computer workstations, group study rooms of which 14 are equipped with computers and large screen LCD displays, two multimedia suites, and two library instruction rooms with over 60 workstations.
BARN.
An automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) is an integral part of the building and allows for many years of collection development. Designed and built by Daifuku of America at its North American Headquarters in Salt Lake City, the system is enclosed in a by and climate-controlled corner of the library building. Three isles of shelves are served by three Storage and Retrieval Machines (SRMs) that can retrieve an average of 875 volumes a day. There is space to add a fourth row of shelves when it is needed. The BARN (Borrower’s Automated Retrieval Network) was so named in reference to Utah State University’s status as an agricultural school.
All of the Merrill-Cazier Library’s bound journals, approximately 170,000 less frequently used books, and most of the microform are stored in the BARN. There are currently nearly 480,000 items with room to expand to approximately 1.5 million items.
Items can be requested from the BARN using the library’s online catalog and are made available for checkout at services desks. Books are available on the first floor at the circulation desk and journals and microform are available on the second floor at the serial/periodical desk.

Pickle Bridge Line

The Pickle Bridge Line is a disused railway route in Northern England that ran between the cities of Huddersfield and Bradford.
History.
The line was authorised in 1865 and amended 1873. Construction started in 1874.
Wyke viaduct.
Wyke viaduct (locally known as Red Lion viaduct) was by far the largest engineering feature on the line, a 22 arch stone construction built by Hawkshaw & Meek. Unfortunately it was an unnecessary diversion around an unfriendly landowner across unsuitable ground. It suffered from subsidence due to local mine workings and a speed limit was imposed, followed by diversion of all passenger services in 1948 and complete closure of the line in 1952. The viaduct continued to deteriorate and British Rail applied for permission to partly demolish it, as by this time it was grade II listed. This permission was granted and the 14 arches at the northern end of the viaduct were demolished in 1987. Today, the viaduct is owned by BRB (Residuary) Ltd.

Thomas Sexton (Irish politician)

Thomas Sexton (1848–1932) was an Irish journalist, financial expert, nationalist politician and Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1880 to 1896, representing four different constituencies. He was Lord Mayor of Dublin 1888–1889.
Early life.
He was born at Ballygannon, County Waterford, where he attended the local CBS school. He became a leader-writer on "The Nation" newspaper and a member of the Parnellite Irish Parliamentary Party.
Career.
He was first elected MP for County Sligo in the 1880 general election, for South Sligo in the 1885 general election, then for Belfast West in the 1886 election and for North Kerry in the 1892 election. He was a cosignator of the "No Rent Manifesto" issued in 1881. He was regarded as one of the finest orators of the Irish Party, but handicapped by a querulous temperament. Following the party split over Parnell's leadership, he sided with John Dillon's anti-Parnellite faction, then in 1896 retired from parliamentary politics, disgusted at the bitter factionalism following the failure of the second Home Rule bill. 
Sexton was a member of the Committee, chaired by Hugh Childers, to enquire into the financial relations between Great Britain and Ireland. In the report of the committee, published in 1896, he wrote a minority report showing that the tax burden on Ireland had been steadily increased throughout the nineteenth century, at the same time as its people were steadily impoverished.
He was hostile to the Irish Land Acts (1903) on financial grounds, and regarded by William O'Brien as one of the principal players involved in his subsequent marginalisations from the Irish Party. Sexton continued to be a leading ally of Dillon as Chairman of the board of the "Freeman's Journal" from 1893 to 1911; however, his policy of cutting investments to maintain dividends led to the demise of the paper through William Martin Murphy's "Irish Independent".
Later life.
After retiring from the "Freeman's Journal" he became Chairman of Boland's Mill, and during World War I denounced wartime taxation and in 1918 endorsed Sinn Féin. At the end of his career he supported Fianna Fáil because it promised tariff protection for flour-milling.

Chris Cuthbert

Chris Cuthbert (born 1957) is a Canadian play-by-play sportscaster for the TSN cable network. Formerly, he worked for CBC Sports in a multitude of roles and for the American television network NBC on "NHL on NBC".
He was lead play-by-play voice for Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for CTV, where he worked alongside Pierre McGuire, who also worked the tournament for NBC, and Ray Ferraro.
Biography.
CBC.
Cuthbert joined CBC Sports in 1984, where he anchored regional western games for "Hockey Night in Canada", usually from Edmonton. He also got spot play-by-play work when the network's primary western broadcaster, Don Wittman, was busy covering other events for the network. 
He got his big break during the 1988 Stanley Cup Playoffs. On April 18, he was positioned as a reporter in Washington, providing brief and periodic reports of the Washington Capitals-New Jersey Devils game to the national CBC viewing audience watching the Canadian network's game broadcast from Montreal (the Canadiens against the Boston Bruins). A power outage struck the Montreal area, which postponed the game in that city, and CBC was forced to turn to Cuthbert in Washington to provide the full broadcast - play-by-play, analyst, host and everything else. The broadcast was totally done off the cuff as besides no regular analysts, there were no graphics or replay capabilities. His stellar solo effort caught the network's attention, was nominated for a Gemini Award, and launched what has been a very successful broadcasting career.
Cuthbert rose to a sportscaster for CBC, where he called Olympic sports, figure skating, Canadian football, and NHL hockey. He eventually became the lead play-by-play voice of "CFL on CBC", broadcasting the Grey Cup Championship each November from 1996 to 2004. He was the secondary play-by-play voice behind Don Wittman. His most notable work was "Hockey Night in Canada" ("HNIC") games primarily involving the Montreal Canadiens or NHL teams from Western Canada. In the era of the CBC's "Hockey Night in Canada" double-headers, Cuthbert usually called the late games. He was also assigned to a conference final every year from 1989 until 2004.
Departure from CBC.
Cuthbert's contract was terminated by the CBC on February 24, 2005, by CBC Sports executive director Nancy Lee while the network endured the 2004–05 NHL lockout. There was much outrage over his firing, similar to that of Ron MacLean who had almost threatened to leave the network over stalled contract negotiations, as many believed he'd be the successor to Bob Cole. Some criticized Lee, who had created the position "Manager of Program Acquisitions" for CBC Sports to hire her friend Sue Prestedge a year earlier, despite the looming threat of the NHL lockout. It was also believed that Cuthbert's strong opposition, when CBC chose to drop its popular "Hockey Day in Canada" broadcast, did not endear himself to Lee. This decision was widely criticized, as rival network TSN staged a "Hockey Day" of its own.
TSN and NBC.
After joining TSN in the spring of 2005, Cuthbert became TSN's lead CFL football voice, replacing TSN-original John Wells. Coincidentally, Cuthbert got his job at CBC in 1984 when Wells left the network to join the fledgling TSN. Since TSN gained the exclusive television rights to the CFL starting in 2008, Cuthbert has returned to his role as Grey Cup announcer. He also serves as one of the network's hockey play-by-play voices.
In the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons, he also worked for NBC, usually worked alongside analyst Peter McNab and inside the glass reporter Darren Pang for regional NHL broadcasts. 
Cuthbert made National Hockey League history on December 1, 2006 as the first play-by-play announcer in NHL's history to deliberately broadcast a game from ice level, rather than a high up broadcast gondola. Along with Glenn Healy, he called the Buffalo Sabres/New York Rangers game at HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York. According to the Globe & Mail, "it was a good show and it's unlikely to be the last."
2010 Winter Olympics.
Cuthbert was also one of the play-by-play announcers for men’s ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, including announcing the gold medal game between Canada and the United States. Just before Canada's Sidney Crosby scored the gold medal winning goal seven minutes and forty seconds into overtime, Cuthbert said "Pavelski shot, that's saved by Luongo. Niedermayer regroups, Crosby over the line, Sidney Crosby can't bust in, up with it again he's on the ice with Iginla. Iginla—" then yelled "Crosby scores! Sidney Crosby! The golden goal! And Canada has once-in-a-lifetime Olympic gold!" and then later added "These golden games have their crowning moment. And why wouldn’t it be Sidney Crosby to leave his mark on this Olympic tournament."

Middleham Chapel

Middleham Chapel is an historic Episcopal church located at 10210 H. G. Trueman Road in Lusby, Calvert County, Maryland. It is a one-story, cruciform, Flemish bond brick structure with exposed fieldstone foundations. It was built in 1748, to replace an earlier frame or log structure believed to have been erected as early as 1684, as a Chapel of Ease of Christ Church Parish. The date of construction is worked into the brick on the front of the church.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.
Middleham Chapel is still in use today. In 1900 it joined with nearby St. Peter's Chapel to form Middleham and St. Peter's Episcopal Parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland. The parish's current rector is the Rev. David Showers.

Rabbah bar bar Hana

Rabbah bar bar Hana was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in Babylonia, known as an Amora of the second generation. He was the grandson of Hana and the brother of Hiyya. He went to Palestine and became a pupil of Rav Yochanan, whose sayings he transmitted. Rabbah Bar Bar Hana is especially well known for a collection of aggadic stories about him recorded in the Babylonian Talmud in the fifth chapter of Bava Batra.
Rabbah bar bar Hana (Rabbah bar Rabbah bar Hana) does not seem to have enjoyed high regard in his adopted country, for it was taken as a matter of course that Rav Shimon ben Lakish should not do him the honor of addressing him in public. After a somewhat prolonged sojourn in Palestine he returned to Babylonia, residing both at Pumbedita and at Sura. In the former city he at first refused to attend the lectures of Rav Judah ben Ezekiel, but he soon became his friend, and was consulted by him in difficult cases. Judah and his pupil Rabbah b. Naḥmani once visited Rabbah, who was ill, and submitted a halakhic question to him. While they were there a Zoroastrian priest ("geber") suddenly appeared and extinguished the lamp, the day being a festival of Ormuzd, on which Jews were forbidden to have fire in their houses. Rabbah thereupon sorrowfully exclaimed: "O God, let us live either under Thy protection, or at least under the protection of the children of Esau Romans".
The persecutions of the Babylonian Jews by the Sassanids caused Rabbah to resolve to return to Palestine, although it is nowhere said that he carried out that intention. During his residence at Sura he wished to introduce the recitation of the Ten Commandments into the daily prayer, but was dissuaded by Rav Chisda. Later he visited Maḥoza, and he tells of the wonderful feats he saw performed there by a juggler.
Haggadic Aphorisms.
Some haggadic sayings by Rabbah bar bar Hana have been preserved. Citing , he compares the Torah to fire, in that as fire does not start of itself neither does the Law endure in solitary study. His interpretations of and also are noteworthy; his saying that "the soul of one pious man is worth the whole world" is especially memorable.
Rabbah bar bar Hana's stories of his marvelous experiences during his voyages and his journeys through the desert have become famous. These accounts may be divided into two classes. In the first he records his observations, generally beginning with the words "I have seen." Among these are his remarks regarding the identity of the most fertile part of Palestine—"the land flowing with milk and honey"; the distance between Jericho and Jerusalem; the area of the district in the plains of Moab mentioned in as the camp of the children of Israel; the castor-oil plant cultivated in Palestine, or the gourd of Jonah. Here also belong his accounts of his relations with the Arabs, one of whom once used a term that explained to him the word in .
Fantastic Adventures.
The other group of the narratives of Rabbah bar bar Hana includes his fantastic adventures on the sea and in the desert. In these stories one of the most conspicuous figures is the Arab who was the guide of Rabbah and his companions on their journey through the desert. This Arab knew the route so well that he could tell from the odor of the sand when a spring was near. The travelers passed through the desert in which the children of Israel wandered for forty years, and the Arab showed Mount Sinai to Rabbah, who heard the voice of God speaking from the mountain and regretting Israel's exile. The Arab likewise pointed out the place where Korah and his followers had been swallowed by the earth, and from the smoking abyss Rabbah heard the words, "Moses is truth and his teachings are truth, but we are liars". He was shown the gigantic bodies of the Israelites who had died in the desert, lying face upward, and the place where heaven and earth almost touched, so that he could watch the rotation of the heavenly spheres around the earth in twenty-four hours.
Rabbah's stories of his adventures on the sea resemble tales of other navigators concerning the immense size of various marine animals. As an example the following one may be cited: "Once, while on a ship, we came to a gigantic fish at rest, which we supposed to be an island, since there was sand on its back, in which grass was growing. We therefore landed, made a fire, and cooked our meal. But when the fish felt the heat he rolled over, and we would have drowned had not the ship been near". Here the resemblance to the later voyage of Sinbad the Sailor is obvious. Rabbah himself tells how his tales were received. In regard to two of them his colleagues remarked, "All "Rabbahs" are asses and all "bar bar Hanas" fools". Rabbah's stories have called forth an entire literature; in addition to the numerous commentaries on the aggadahic portions of the Talmud that dwell by preference on these accounts, more than twenty essays interpreting and annotating them have appeared in various periodicals.

Gin House Blues

"Gin House Blues" is the title of two different blues songs, which have become confused over the years. Both songs were first recorded by Bessie Smith. 
The song originally titled "Gin House Blues" was written by Fletcher Henderson and Henry Troy in 1925, and recorded by Bessie Smith with Henderson on 18 March 1926. It has the opening lines "I've got a sad sad story today / I'm goin' to the gin house when the whistle blows..."
However, the song now most usually called "Gin House" or "Gin House Blues" - with the opening lines "Stay away from me 'cause I'm in my sin / If this place gets raided, it's just me and my gin..." - is an entirely different song. It was originally entitled "Me and My Gin", and was recorded by Bessie Smith on 25 August 1928 and released on Columbia 14384-D. It was written by "Harry Burke", which may be a pseudonym of the pianist and songwriter James C. Johnson. It is this song which has been recorded by many musicians over the years under the title "Gin House Blues" (see listing below), with authorship usually credited to Henderson and Troy, apparently in error.

Delta Muscae

Delta Muscae (δ Mus, δ Muscae), often catalogued as HD 112985, is a spectroscopic binary star system and the closest to the Earth in the southern hemisphere constellation of Musca (the Fly) at a distance of approximately 27.8 parsecs (91.0 light years). The main star is classified as a giant star with an orange tint. It is one of the stars given a Bayer designation by astronomer Johann Bayer. It was recorded in Bayer's 1603 publication "Uranometria". In addition it is one of the main stars used in the visual formation of the Musca constellation.
Distance and visibility.
Based on research done by the European Space Agency for the Hipparcos Star Catalogue, Delta Muscae exhibits a parallax of 35.91 milliarcseconds. With this data, it can be calculated that Delta Muscae is situated at a distance of 27.8 parsecs, or 91.0 light years, from the sun.
Even though Delta Muscae is the closest star to Earth in the Musca constellation, nearly 3800 stars are closer in proximity to the Earth as stated by the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars, which includes stars within twenty-five parsecs of the Sun.
Delta Muscae is a star of the third magnitude (or 3.61(v) to be exact) when viewed from the Earth, and is visible to the naked eye in regions that lack dense light pollution.
Stellar and system characteristics.
Delta Muscae has a listed spectral type of K2III. The K2 portion of this designation specifies that Delta Muscae A is a class K2 star, meaning the light it emits is orange in color. The main star burns at a temperature cooler than our own sun (Sol), which is a G2 star. The second part of the classification, III, specifies that Delta Muscae is a giant star which has already left the main sequence of star life like our sun.

Rincon del Diablo is an unincorporated community in San Diego County, California. Because it predates Escondido and other geopolitical boundaries, it does not necessarily correspond to present day definitions. It encompasses the city of Escondido to the north and west and San Pasqual Valley neighborhood of San Diego to the southeast.
Western and northern parts of the community contain low-density semi-rural housing. Southeastern part is agricultural. The Orfila winery is located on the border between Rincon del Diablo and San Diego.
The community is divided between zip codes 92025 and 92027. The area code is 760. In part, is within the "sphere of influence" of Escondido, and therefore those parts may eventually be annexed to the city. Current city policies prevent the city from actively seeking annexation of new land and require property owners to petition to be annexed, a slow and expensive process.
It shares the name with the original Rancho Rincon del Diablo that included the city of Escondido and surrounding areas in the 19th century. Rincon del Diablo means "Devil's Corner" in Spanish. 
The United States Census Bureau does not provide demographic estimates for the community. Rincon Del Diablo includes census tract 207.06 of San Diego County. According to SANDAG estimates, total population of census tract 207.06 is 6,159 people. Median household income is $116,487. 19.2% are under the age of 18 and 17.3% are over 65. Median age is 46.1 years. Ethnic makeup is 76.5% non-Hispanic White, 15.7% Hispanic, 4.4% Asian / Pacific Islander. In 2008, there were 4,572 registered voters in the community.

Cosmic Balance II

The Cosmic Balance II is a computer game created by Strategic Simulations, Inc. in 1983.
Summary.
This video game is a 4X turn-based strategic level space warfare game. The game consists of several scenarios that grow in complexity, starting with a solitary one that acts as a tutorial in resource management, through set two-player scenarios involving more and more planets and ships. The game also has a scenario creation tool. Games can be played against a computer or human opponent.
The map consists of 16 space sectors which vary in size and shape. Despite this, all sectors have 40 planets in them. There are four types of planets in the game: terran, industrial, mining, and farming. Terran planets on their own can produce industrial output (IO). Industrial output is what constitutes income in the game. The remaining types of planets can only produce IO by collectively forming what is called a commerce net.
There are 15 classes of ships. Ships can travel inside or to an adjacent sector to perform missions. Ships have varying capabilities - cost, attack strength, defensive strength, speed, etc. - but the three main qualities of a ship are, hull size, whether they carry cargo or not, and what type of warp drive range they have. These qualities determine which type of mission or missions they are best suited for.
Combat is resolved either by the game itself randomly calculating a result or allows an interface with The Cosmic Balance I, the tactical level space combat game preceding Cosmic Balance II. The interface between the two games is essentially manual. In this case, Cosmic Balance II lists the ship types involved in the battle, the type of Cosmic Balance I scenario which corresponds to the Cosmic Balance II mission being performed, and the tech levels of the combatants. The player(s) save their game, load Cosmic Balance I, set up the appropriate scenario in it, and complete a game. They then reload Cosmic Balance II and their saved game. Cosmic Balance II then asks for the results: ships destroyed, captured, or that ran away. These are entered and the game continues based on these entered results.
Reception.
"Computer Gaming World" stated that "Cosmic Balance II" "was too much like working on a balance sheet and watching the numbers change" and "Visicalc in space". It stated that the game was best played as a companion to its predecessor.

Ontology engineering

Ontology engineering in computer science and information science is a new field, which studies the methods and methodologies for building ontologies: formal representations of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.
A large-scale representation of abstract concepts such as actions, time, physical objects and beliefs would be an example of ontological engineering.
Overview.
Ontologies provide a common vocabulary of an area and define, with different levels of formality, the meaning of the terms and the relationships between them. During the last decade, increasing attention has been focused on ontologies. Ontologies are now widely used in knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and computer science; in applications related to areas such as knowledge management, natural language processing, e-commerce, intelligent information integration, bio-informatics, education; and in new emerging fields like the semantic web. Ontological engineering is a new field of study concerning the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tool suites and languages that support them.
Ontology languages.
An ontology language is a formal language used to encode the ontology. There are a number of such languages for ontologies, both proprietary and standards-based:
Ontology engineering in life sciences.
Life sciences is flourishing with ontologies that biologists use to make sense of their experiments. For inferring correct conclusions from experiments, ontologies have to be structured optimally against the knowledge base they represent. The structure of an ontology needs to be changed continuously so that it is an accurate representation of the underlying domain.
Recently, an automated method was introduced for engineering ontologies in life sciences such as Gene Ontology (GO), one of the most successful and widely used biomedical ontology. Based on information theory, it restructures ontologies so that the levels represent the desired specificity of the concepts. Similar information theoretic approaches have also been used for optimal partition of Gene Ontology. Given the mathematical nature of such engineering algorithms, these optimizations can be automated to produce a principled and scalable architecture to restructure ontologies such as GO.

Born Late is the second studio album released by pop singer, Shaun Cassidy. The album was released in 1977 following the success of Cassidy's self-titled debut album.
The album yielded two hit singles. The first, "Hey Deanie", was written by Eric Carmen, who also wrote the song "That's Rock 'n' Roll" (which was a hit from Cassidy's first solo album). "Hey Deanie" reached #7 in early 1978. For the second single, also following the formula of his first album, Cassidy remade a 1960s hit, in this case The Lovin' Spoonful's "Do You Believe in Magic?" (which was written by John Sebastian). That single became a modest hit, peaking at #31 on the US Billboard Hot 100. 
Unlike his first album, Cassidy wrote or co-wrote half of the songs. The track "It's Up To You" was co-written with Cassidy by "Lost In Space" child-star Billy Mumy.

The Gorgopotamos (, "the rushing river") is a river in the southern part of Phthiotis, Central Greece, Greece not far from the border with Phocis. The river is host to the "Ellinopygosteos" fish "(Pungitius hellenicus)".
Geography.
The Gorgopotamos rises 4 km north of Pavliani and west of Koumaritsi in the Oiti mountains with two streams. The river flows through a steep forested valley. It passes under OSE's Athens-Thessaloniki railway line and through the village Gorgopotamos, where it enters the plains. It empties into the river Spercheios near Ydromilos, 5 km southwest of Lamia.
History.
The railway bridge over the river is famous for one of the biggest sabotage acts of World War II, "Operation Harling". A British mission and 150 Greek partisans blew it up on 25 November 1942, cutting off German supplies being transported between Athens and Thessaloniki (mostly headed for Africa). The blast destroyed two of the six piers of the bridge, which have now been replaced with steel girders. The area around the bridge is a monument.

Less successful commercially than its two predecessors, "Under Wraps" was an early indication that Cassidy's popularity was beginning to lose momentum, as the album barely cracked the top 40 on the US Billboard charts, peaking at #33, and scoring no major US hit singles.
The album features the song "It's Like Heaven", which was co-written by founding Beach Boys member Brian Wilson, along with Rocky Pamplin and Diane Rovell. This would mean Wilson would have contributed musically to an album by both Cassidy brothers, as he also co-wrote the song "Cruisin' to Harlem" on the album "Getting It in the Street" by David Cassidy, Shaun Cassidy's half-brother.

Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada

The Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, created by an Act of Parliament in 1984, is an independent, not-for-profit think-tank on Canada's relations with Asia.
Based in Vancouver, the Foundation functions as a knowledge broker, bringing together people and knowledge to provide current and comprehensive research, analysis and information on Canada's transpacific relations. It promotes dialogue on economic, security, political and social issues, fostering informed decision-making in the Canadian public, private and non-governmental sectors. The Foundation also provides grants to support policy research and informed discussion on Canada’s relations with Asia.
History of the Foundation.
The Foundation was created as part of the Canadian government’s growing interest in relations with Asia under the administrations of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Its inception in 1984 was led by the Department of External Affairs, and was specifically proposed by the director general of the Department’s Asian and Pacific bureau, Tom Delworth. At the time the Department was headed by Secretary of State for External Affairs Joe Clark. Soon after, Vancouver businessman John Bruk was commissioned by the Department to undertake a study of the proposal. His report was accepted and became the basis for the founding Act. Bruk became the founding Chairman. The founders aimed to create an independent source of thought on Canada’s trade, investment and political relations with Asia. This came amidst the growing perception of Canada as a Pacific country, compared with its relations being conducted primarily by the Eastern provinces across the Atlantic. As a result it was mandated that the Foundation’s primary office should always be in Vancouver, British Columbia as to promote relations with Asia across the Pacific. This idea was the premise for the creation of the Asia–Pacific Gateway and Corridor Initiative, whose mission is to establish Canada’s Asia–Pacific Gateway and Corridor as the best transportation network facilitating global supply chains between North America and Asia.
The Foundation was initially funded on short-term plans or for specific projects with contributions from both the Federal and Provincial governments, as well as by corporate and private donors. In 2005 a founding supporter of the Foundation, Senator Jack Austin, led an initiative to award the Foundation a C$ 50 million endowment from the Government of Canada, from where it now draws much of its funding, in addition to private and corporate donations.
Mandate.
The Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada undertakes strategic research on Canada's economic, political and social relations with Asia-Pacific. The goal is to provide guidance on Asia Pacific topics for business and governments, and to enhance the links among the policy, business and research communities in areas relating to Canada's ties with Asia.
Governance.
The affairs of the Foundation are managed by a Board of Directors. The Board consists of a Chairperson and up to six other directors appointed by the Governor in Council; up to 18 additional directors appointed by the Board after consultation with provincial governments and other interested outside parties; and the President of the Foundation. The Chairperson and each of the Board members is appointed for a term of three years, and may serve a maximum of three terms. The Board, which has ultimate responsibility for the Foundation’s activities, meets at least twice a year. It is responsible for setting the strategic directions of the Foundation, management of the endowment fund, and appointment of the President.
Yuen Pau Woo is the current President and CEO. He is Coordinator for the PECC State of the Region Report, Director of the APEC Study Centre in Canada, and Adjunct Professor at the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia (UBC).
Publications.
The Foundation undertakes research and analysis on Canada-Asia relationships and publishes the results on its website. Electronic publications are available free of charge and include: a daily Canada-Asia News Service (a summary of stories involving Canada-Asia business and government relations and links to the main headlines from Asia); Canada Asia Agenda (a concise analysis of issues in Canada's involvement with a major Asia Pacific partner or major regional industry); Research Reports (research on areas of Canada’s involvement with Asia undertaken by Canadian scholars); Asian Business Cases (studies offering executives and researchers insights into the way major companies solve problems and overcome obstacles in their Asian operations, taken from the portfolio of case studies in the archive of the Richard Ivey School of Business at the University of Western Ontario); and Investment Monitor(a summary of new Canadian investments in Asia and Asian investments in Canada). The Foundation also conducts surveys, including the National Opinion Poll (an nationwide poll on various aspects of Canadian perceptions of Asia) ; and the Points of View Asia Pacific Poll (an opinion poll of Canadians engaged in Asia through professional, research or personal interests.) All of the publications are available through the Foundation's subscription service.
The Foundation focuses on my aspects of the Canada-Asia relationship including trade, human rights, two-way investment and more. The Foundation's work covers all of Asia–Pacific with an especially strong focus on Canada-China relations and Canada-India relations.
The Foundation also operates a video channel, Asia Pacific Video [http://www.asiapacific.ca/media/video]. The channel regularly features Foundation staff and outside experts discussing relevant topics in Canada-Asia relations. Past videos have featured Joe Clark, Joseph Caron, Jim O'Neill, Richard Woolcott and Louise Fréchette.
Special Projects.
The Foundation’s Research Grants Program is funded through the proceeds of an endowment established by the Government of Canada and is designed to support research and informed discussion on Canada’s relations with Asia. As part of its Grants Program, the Foundation also awards several Media Fellowships to Canadian journalists each year.
The current Senior Fellows for the Foundation are Joseph Wong, Yves Tiberghien, Brian Job, Pitman Potter, Ito Peng, Henry Wang, Yuezi Zhao, David Zwieg, and Hank Bull.
The current Distinguished Fellows for the Foundation are Stockwell Day, Len Edwards, Joseph Caron, David Emerson, David Mulroney and Donald W. Campbell.
In April 2011 the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada launched a new project entitled the National Conversation on Asia (NCA). The NCA is a broad and inclusive initiative that aims to get Canadians thinking and talking about what Asia means to Canada. It is supported by Asia-engaged individuals, companies and organizations across Canada. The project features an Emerging Voices on Asia blog, online conversations, an interactive map project, Asia Contemporary Speaker Series on contemporary Asian art, Three Questions series, community events and other outreach and engagement activities. The NCA has also produced five task force reports. 
Through a program of stakeholder consultations, research and public communications, the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada is seeking to advance dialogue on Canada's Asia Pacific Gateway, identifying policy priorities for governments and measures to strengthen the competitiveness of Canadian businesses and contribute to sustainable gateway communities.
Launched in 2012, the Canada-China Human Capital Dialogue is a research partnership between think-tanks of the two countries on the opportunities and challenges of managing and capitalizing talent flows between Canada and China.

Dunneworthy is a district located approximately North East of the town of Ararat, Victoria, Australia. When surveyed in the 1850s there were plans for a sizeable township and a railway station was built. Development never eventuated and today the district is home to approximately 100 people.
The largest property in the area was named after the district ("Dunneworthy"), when it was split from the original Woodlands run that comprised practically all the land west of Ararat.
To the west is the Dunneworthy State Forest
Playing in the Victorian competition, the Dunneworthy Touch Club are named after the district.

Murrindindi, Victoria

Murrindindi is a locality along the valley of the Murrundindi River in Victoria, Australia in the Shire of Murrindindi local government area. The nearest town is Yea, Victoria.
The name comes from the pastoral run begun by squatter Peter Snodgrass in 1837, which was originally (and probably correctly) spelled "Murrundindi". In the Woiwurrung language of central Victoria the name means “"living in the mountains"”. However, the inaccurate translation “"mist of the mountains"” is sometimes given.
Snodgrass’s station covered the area from the present-day town of Yea up the valleys of the east and west branches of the Muddy Creek (now Yea River). His homestead was near the junction of these two branches, therefore surveyors named the east branch Murrindindi Creek (now River).
There has never been a Murrindindi town. The gold rush town of Higinbotham (began 1868, lasted for a few years, now completely vanished) with a maximum of 200 residents was the nearest to a town that the valley has seen. Modern maps place the name Murrindindi at the site where the War Memorial Hall once stood (now a public reserve) or a little further to the south on Cummins Lane where the local volunteer fire station is situated. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries these would have been called Lower Murrindindi, and Upper Murrindindi was the locality now called Woodbourne and adjacent areas up the Ault Beag Creek. Ault Beag (Gaelic for “little creek”) was named by an early Scots settler, Duncan McLeish.
Farming and timber were the main industries of the area when the British settled the valley, and remain so today. Although much of the area was deforested by the timber industry, regrowth and sustainable logging techniques have restored the forests to some semblance of their former beauty, with management today as the Black Range State Forest. Tourism (trail-bike riding, fishing etc.) and sightseeing (rapids on the Murrindindi River, and the Wilhelmina Falls on a tributary) activities are carried on in the forest areas.
Since the 1990s there has been a considerable growth in the number of vineyards in the valley, which is in the Upper Goulburn wine region of Victoria. These grow cabernet sauvignon, merlot, pinot noir and chardonnay grapes, primarily for wineries outside the area (and the grapes are usually labelled “Yea Valley”), but Cuthbertson‘s Murrindindi and Sedona are two local vineyard/winery labels.
On February 7, 2009 a fire started at the old abandoned Murrindindi timber mill which spread to become one of the major conflagrations known as Black Saturday. Although there were no human casualties at Murrindindi, many lives were lost further away at Marysville and Narbethong.

Wasp (album)

Wasp was the fifth and final studio album released by teen-idol, Shaun Cassidy in 1980. In an attempt to salvage a sinking pop career, Cassidy recruited Todd Rundgren to help "reinvent" his music career. Members of Rundgren's group Utopia also played on the record and the work had a decidedly "new wave" feel.
The majority of tracks featured on "Wasp" were cover songs. The album featured a version of David Bowie's song, "Rebel Rebel" where Cassidy included a passage from The Crystals' "He's a Rebel." Other covers included Peter Townshend's "So Sad About Us," Ian Hunter's "Once Bitten, Twice Shy," the Talking Heads' "The Book I Read," The Animals' 1965 hit "It's My Life," and The Four Tops' 1966 hit "Shake Me, Wake Me." All of the other songs were written by Rundgren and various members of his band. Unlike his previous four albums where he wrote at least one song, Cassidy was given a co-writing credit on "Cool Fire."
The reinvention of teenybopper Cassidy as an edgy new wave artist was not enough to capture the attention of audiences. The album was Cassidy's second album not to chart on Billboard, essentially spelling the end of Cassidy's pop music career. He would score a final hit in Europe in 1989, with the standalone single "Memory Girl".

GPHS-RTG

GPHS-RTG or General Purpose Heat Source — Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, is a specific design of the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) used on US space missions. The GPHS-RTG was used on "Ulysses" (1), "Galileo" (2), "Cassini-Huygens" (3), and "New Horizons" (1).
The GPHS-RTG has an overall diameter of 0.422 m and a length of 1.14 m.
Each GPHS-RTG has a mass of about 57 kg and generates about 300 Watts of electrical power at the start of mission (5.2 We/kg), using about 7.8 kg of Pu-238 which produces about 4,400 Watts of thermal power. The plutonium oxide fuel is in 18 GPHSs. Note that the GPHS are cuboid although they contain cylindrical plutonium based pellets.
The GPHS-RTG units used on spacecraft were not created by NASA. They were designed and built by General Electric Space Division (later part of Martin-Marietta, subsequently part of Lockheed Martin), in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. The generators were filled with plutonium by Department of Energy laboratories in Miamisburg, Ohio and Idaho Falls, Idaho.
After the Ulysses and Galileo RTGs were fueled, their launches were postponed by four and three years respectively. As a result, the missions were slightly adapted to utilize the lower power that would be available. The decay heat reduces by about 0.8% per year, so the thermoelectric converter 'ages' or degrades to some extent.
The thermoelectric elements convert the heat energy from the isotope into electricity.
The GPHS-RTG use SiGe thermoelectric elements ('Unicouples') which are no longer in production.
Missions after 2010 requiring RTGs, such as the Mars Science Laboratory, will use the MMRTG instead.

The Neutral Ion Coupling Explorer (NICE)is one of six proposed SMEX[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/may/HQ_C08029_SMEX_Awards.html satellites under consideration by NASA. The goal of the NICE mission is to answer the question: How do neutral dynamics drive ionospheric variability? NICE will approach this goal with three targeted investigations of neutral-ion coupling:
Mission definition.
NICE will discover how winds and composition of the upper atmosphere drive the electric fields and chemical reactions that control Earth's ionosphere. The mission will resolve competing theories about the low-latitude ionospheric dynamo, and will explain how large-scale waves from the lower atmosphere can couple to the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Understanding neutral-ion coupling in Earth's atmosphere has applications for solar and planetary atmospheres including Mars and Jupiter. NICE will be the first mission to simultaneously measure all the key parameters that both characterize and drive the ionosphere. It will remotely measure the neutral wind, temperature, composition, atmospheric and ionospheric density distributions as well as make in situ measurements of the ion motion. NICE uses flight-tested science instruments in a low-inclination orbit where the geometry magnetically links the in situ and remote sensing measurements.

Snowboard Riot (Board Warriors in Japan) is a snowboarding video game for WiiWare by Hudson Soft released in North America on February 2, 2009 and in the PAL regions on February 27, 2009. The game supports the Wii Balance Board and features online multiplayer via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.
Gameplay.
In the game, players race against each other across four courses. Along the way, they can pick up weapons and power-ups such as mines, homing missiles, turbo boosts, invisibility and shields in order to hinder their opponents and aid themselves. Players can also use their board to protect themselves from attack. Each course features several alternate routes and hazards such as cliffs, but are linear and require the player to enter a teleportation portal at the bottom to warp them to the top of the course to start the next lap.
Players will be able to choose from four characters, and be able to customize and upgrade their gear, giving them performance boosts. The game also features a time attack mode, two player split screen offline multiplayer and online multiplayer against up to four opponents, and an option to race without weapons or power-ups.
Reception.
IGN handed the game a 5.5/10, criticizing its "overly aggressive" rubberband AI and an unrewarding single player experience. WiiWare World gave it 5/10, finding that the reliance on using weapons to win rather than pure racing skill can result in a frustrating experience for the player.

USS Onkahye (1843)

USS "Onkahye" was a schooner of the United States Navy. A unique ship in the American Navy under sail, the vessel occupied a significant place in ship development, being the only converted sailing yacht to serve on distant station before the American Civil War. Its design was influential and it is considered the model for modern American sailing yachts. 
Used in the anti-piracy/anti-slave trade patrols in the Caribbean, it went down in 1848 off East Caicos, in the Turks & Caicos Islands. A NOAA-supported expedition in 2008 conducted field work in search of the "Onkahye" and the "USS Chippewa", also known to have gone down in that area in 1816. 
History.
"Onkahye", a schooner yacht of a radical Robert L. Stevens design, was laid down in 1839 by William Capes, Williamsburg, New York, opposite the Brooklyn Navy Yard. After it was launched in 1840, it was purchased by the Navy in early 1843 and converted to a warship. It was commissioned at Gosport Navy Yard, Virginia, 11 July 1843, with Lt. William C. Whittle in command. Because of its speed, the schooner's unique design strongly influenced the development of modern American sailing yachts.
Departing Norfolk 23 October 1843, "Onkahye" spent her first commission as a dispatch vessel in Charleston, South Carolina, returning to Norfolk 18 June 1844 and decommissioning two days later. She recommissioned 10 April 1845 and sailed 9 May 1845 for duty in the Caribbean and the West Indies. She was among the ships used for anti-piracy/anti-slave trade patrols, as the United States and Great Britain had worked cooperatively since 1808 to suppress the international slave trade. 
Sailing to Vera Cruz, Mexico, to unload passengers, the schooner moved on to Cuba and then returned to Norfolk 14 July 1845. The warship sailed for the West Indies again 11 September 1845. She remained on duty in those waters and along the northern coast of South America until departing Mobile Bay 8 November 1845 for Norfolk, arriving 1 January 1846 and decommissioning on 9 January 1846. Throughout her service in southern waters, the ship patrolled against pirates and slavers, her great speed making her a valuable asset as a chase and dispatch vessel.
"Onkahye" recommissioned 22 April 1847, Lt. Otway Berryman commanding, and sailed for Caribbean waters once again before the month was out. Cruising the West Indies and South American coast, the schooner put into Rio de Janeiro 22 November 1847 and stayed there until 29 January 1848. She captured the bark "Lawrence", a heavily laden slaver, at that port 24 January 1848. Continuing her patrols in the West Indies, "Onkahye" was lost off Caicos Reef on 21 June 1848 without loss of life.
In 2008, underwater archaeologists, sponsored by NOAA and the Museum of Turks & Caicos, added "Onkahye" to the list of ships they were searching for. They had already located and identified the wrecks of the Spanish slaver "Trouvadore," which sank in 1842, and , which sank in 1816.

Battle of La Réunion

The Battle of La Réunion was an amphibious landing and uprising which brought the island of La Réunion onto the Allied side during the Second World War. The invasion was performed by the FNFL destroyer "Léopard" on 28 November 1942 and toppled the administration loyal to the Vichy Regime, replaced by a Free French administration.
Background.
Since the Battle of France, the island of La Réunion had had little strategic importance, and little defences as a consequence. The Armistice had reduced the military on the island to three officers, one physician, eleven non-commissioned officers, and about 270 men, of which only 23 were professionals. The coastal artillery were out of order.
On 23 June 1940, Raoul Nativel, president of the conseil général, denounced the Armistice on Radio Saint-Denis. The next day, British consul Maurice Gaud met with the Governor of the island, Pierre Aubert, proposing to pay the French administration on British treasure if La Réunion would fight on. The proposal became public when the radio of Mauritius broadcast it. Aubert consulted with local notabilities, but faced with the choice of illegally surrendering the island to a foreign government, he decided to stay loyal to Pétain. Supporters of De Gaulle, General secretary Angelini and captain Plat were transferred, and the president of the colonial commission Adrien Lagourgue was discharged, as well as Nativel.
Governor Aubert, although loyal to the Vichy Regime, was relatively moderate in his support of Pétain's policies. He had however the supreme authority on the island. On the other hand, his cabinet director, Jean-Jacques Pillet, was enthusiastic in his support of the Révolution nationale, organising censorship, propaganda, a special criminal court, and a pro-Vichy militia.
A local resistance movement soon emerged. On 11 November 1941, for Remembrance Day, about 20 women put flowers on the memorial of 1918 at Saint-Denis; they were consequently fined. Communist cells operated under Léon de Lepervanche, though keeping a low profile. La Réunion also harboured prince Duy Tân, who was a keen radio amateur and managed to communicate with Mauritius; he was shortly detained and had his equipment confiscated.
After the Battle of Singapore, in February 1942, the British Eastern Fleet retreated to Addu Atoll in Maldives. Then, following Chuichi Nagumo's Indian Ocean raid in early 1942, the Fleet moved its operational base to Kilindini near Mombasa in Kenya, increasing the British presence on the Eastern African coasts. Soon afterwards, the British struck the French possessions of Madagascar, under Vichy Regime control, with Operation "Ironclad", on 5 May 1942. La Réunion lost her shipping communications with mainland Africa, and the attack further encouraged anti-British sentiments among the Vichy loyalists. On the other hand, De Gaulle, who had not been involved in "Ironclad", felt hard-pressed to re-claim La Réunion from Vichy before the British or Americans would.
On 8 May, Vichy elements in Madagascar signaled that a British cruiser have left South Africa with 600 men aboard to seize the island. Aubert then decided to obstruct the harbour of Le Port by scuttling a ship in the entrance. He also ordered evacuation of the capital of Saint-Denis, as to avoid a bloody bombing like at Diego Soares; in the evening, about 9,000 people had moved to La Montagne, Le Brûlé, Saint-François, and Sainte Marie. No bombing materialised, however, and the population gradually returned to its homes.
The incident had highlighted the fact that the island was helpless against any invasion; on 18 September, it was decided that resistance to a landing would be limited to a mere token fight. Some elements of the military were however determined to fiercely resist a British invasion. On 27 September, Saint-Denis was declared open city, while authorities moved to Hell-Bourg, mocked by De Gaulle's supporters.
On 8 November, Operation "Torch" triggered Case Anton, the German invasion of the so-called "Free Zone", resulting in the Scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon. François Darlan emerged as a rival to De Gaulle, negotiating with General Clark.
Invasion.
On the night of 26 to 27 November 1942, the FNFL large destroyer "Léopard" sailed with 74 troops from Mauritius, arriving off Saint-Denis on 27 at 23:00. She was captained by commander Jules Evenou, who went by the nom de guerre of "Jacques Richard".
Two launches were sent with a 5-man party to search for a favourable landing spot. At 2:30, "Léopard" was sighted by lookouts, as the invasion troops were boarding boats. About 60 men landed and, led by Lieutenant Moreau, took control of the government palace, and the rest of Saint-Denis was under Free France control by the evening. Barraquin, chief of the invasion troops, made contact with friendly elements in the population, notably Communist leader Léon de Lépervanche, and General secretary Rivière, who started arranging the hand-over of the island. Hard-core Vichyist Pillet then fled to Hell-Bourg to organise a resistance. The new governor designated by De Gaulle, André Capagorry, arrived around 6 o'clock, cheered by the population, and gave a speech calling for calm on Radio Saint-Denis.
The next day, on 28 November, Communist cells under Lépervanche activated, seizing the city hall, arresting the mayor and electing Lépervanche as leader of a "Committee of Public Safety"; they next failed in an attempt to capture the 95-mm coastal battery of Le Port, commanded by lieutenant Émile Hugot, considered a hard-core Pétainist. In retaliation, the battery opened fire on "Léopard", which retreated to the open sea and started firing back, killing two. Engineer Raymond Decugis attempted to have the battery cease fire, but was killed by small arms fire. A sortie by the Vichyists was thwarted by small arms fire from the Resistants, severely wounding Hugot. Fearing an assault of their positions by regular troops, the gunners retreated, silencing the battery, and "Léopard" approached Le Port.
Upon learning that the invasion force was French rather than British, and without any response from his government in spite of repeated requests for instructions, Aubert renounced the idea of even a symbolic fight. However, Captain Evenou, growing increasingly nervous at the thought of enemy submarines and fearing for his ship, clumsily attempted to force the issue by threatening to destroy factories on the island. After lengthy negotiations involving Capagorry, Aubert eventually agreed to surrender on the condition that the ultimatum on the factories be made again as a way for him to save face. The surrender was formalised on 30 at 8:45.
Capagorry broadcast the statements:
Aftermath.
On 2 December, Pillet and captain Artignan were discreetly brought aboard "Léopard" as to avoid any popular retaliation. Aubert boarded the next day after lunch with Capagorry, Evenou and Barraquin, and the destroyer departed for Mauritius.
"Léopard" made several trips between Mauritius and La Réunion to provide rice, which had been lacking, contributing greatly to Capagorry's popularity. He gained the nickname of "Papa de riz".
From 20 April 1943, a special court cancelled all sanctions and discharges imposed under the Vichy Regime. Officials of the Vichy administration suffered at most light penalties, except for Jean-Jacques Pillet, who was discharged.

James Scott Memorial Fountain

The James Scott Memorial Fountain is a monument located in Belle Isle Park, in Detroit, Michigan. Designed by architect Cass Gilbert and sculptor Herbert Adams, the fountain was completed in 1925 at a cost of $500,000. The lower bowl has a diameter of and the central spray reaches . The fountain honors the controversial James Scott, who left $200,000 to the City of Detroit for a fountain in tribute to himself.
History.
Scott was left a sizable fortune by his father who invested in Detroit real estate. According to contemporaries, Scott gambled and told off-color stories. He was described by twentieth-century author W. Hawkins Ferry as "vindictive" and a "misanthrope" who attempted to intimidate his business competitors and when this was unsuccessful, he filed suit. Perhaps for these reasons, Scott died in 1910 with no heirs or colleagues and he bequeathed his estate to the City of Detroit with the condition that the fountain include a life-sized statue of him. Some accounts state that the will required that the statue be at the fountain's pinnacle.
Several community and religious leaders spoke against accepting the bequest saying that a person with Scott's reputation should not be immortalized in the city. Mayor Philip Breitmeyer and City Council President David Heineman urged accepting the gift saying that the city shouldn't insult any of its citizens by refusing such a generous offer.
While the debate raged, Scott's fortune continued to grow and by the time construction commenced it topped $1 million. The final design placed Scott's statue in an inconspicuous spot behind the fountain.
Movie appearance.
A famous scene from the 1973 drama "Scarecrow", starring Gene Hackman and Al Pacino was filmed here. In the scene shortly after learning of the death of his estranged son (though falsified by the mother) Pacino's character Francis Lionel 'Lion' Delbuchi, happily plays with a group of children before, upon uncovering a deep emotional truth, he snatches one of them up and begins to ascend the fountain. He is left catatonic in a hospital following the incident.

Federal Trade Commission v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.

Federal Trade Commission v. Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co., , is a 1972 decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may act against a company’s “unfair” business practices even though the practice is none of the following: an antitrust violation, an incipient antitrust violation, a violation of the “spirit” of the antitrust laws, or a deceptive practice. This legal theory is termed the "unfairness doctrine."
Background.
The Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co. (S&H) was in the business of issuing and "redeeming" S&H trading stamps. As explained in the Court’s opinion, trading stamps are a form of “scrip.” They can be used to purchase goods but only at a designated “store.” S&H sold the stamps to merchants, such as supermarket chains, and they “gave” the stamps to their customers, typically at the rate of one stamp for each ten cents' worth of purchases. The customers were instructed to paste the S&H stamps into booklets, and when they had accumulated enough booklets full of S&H stamps they could “redeem” them at an S&H redemption center for “gifts”—merchandise, such as golf clubs or blenders. S&H accounted for 40% of the US trading stamp business and more than 60% of US consumers saved S&H stamps; the industry annually issued 400 billion stamps to more than 200,000 stores, and they were distributed to the public in connection with retail sales of $40 billion.
S&H placed restrictive notices in the booklets, advising consumers that they did not own the stamps, that their only right was to paste the stamps into the booklets and redeem booklets at an S&H redemption center, and that they could not buy, sell, or swap stamps. 
Other trading stamp companies (such as Gold Bond) operated on a similar basis. S&H enforced the restrictions by suing merchants who “trafficked” in S&H stamps, for example, by accepting them in partial payment for merchandise. S&H also sued “trading stamp exchanges,” which were businesses that permitted consumers, for a fee, to swap one kind of stamp for another, in order to consolidate the consumers’ stamp holdings into one brand and thus more rapidly redeem their stamp holdings. Some consumers, the Court noted, “may seek to sell stamps in order to use the resulting cash to make more basic purchases (food, shoes, etc.) than redemption centers normally provide.” S&H attempted to suppress all such “trafficking.”
The FTC sued S&H for this practice (among others) on the ground that this was unfair and oppressive to consumers. After administrative hearings, the FTC ordered S&H to stop interfering with consumers and trading stamp “traffickers” by trying to “suppress the operation of trading stamp exchanges and other ‘free and open’ redemption of stamps.” 
Judgment.
Court of Appeals.
S&H appealed to the Fifth Circuit, which reversed the FTC’s order because section 5 of the FTC Act, under which the FTC had proceeded, “empowers the Commission to restrain only such practices as are either in violation of the antitrust laws, deceptive, or repugnant to public morals.” The Fifth Circuit added that the FTC could declare “unfair” and prohibit only antitrust violations or violations of the spirit of the antitrust laws.
Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Fifth Circuit. After reviewing the legislative history of the statute and the case law, the Court held that 
Significance.
The FTC has occasionally invoked the unfairness doctrine against practices that did not readily fit into existing antitrust or deceptive practices categories, but until recently has not brought many such cases. Currently, however, the FTC has been using the unfairness doctrine against use of Spyware.

Mary and Max is a 2009 Australian clay-animated black comedy-drama film written and directed by Adam Elliot and produced by Melanie Coombs. The voice cast included Philip Seymour Hoffman, Toni Collette, Eric Bana, Bethany Whitmore, with narration by Barry Humphries.
The film premiered on the opening night of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. The film won the Annecy Cristal in June 2009 from the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, and Best Animated Feature Film at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards in November 2009. The film was given a PG-13 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America.
Plot.
It is 1976, and 8-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle (Bethany Whitmore) is a lonely little girl living in Mount Waverley, Australia. Her relatively poor family cannot afford to buy her toys or nice clothing and she is teased by children at her school due to an unfortunate birthmark on her forehead. Her father, Norman, is distant, and her alcoholic and kleptomaniac mother, Vera, provides no support. The closest thing she has to a friend is the man for whom Mary collects mail, Len Hislop, a World War II veteran who lost his legs as a prisoner of war and has developed agoraphobia.
One day, she decides to write a letter to someone living in New York City: by pure chance she chooses Max Jerry Horowitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman) from a telephone directory. Max turns out to be a morbidly obese 44-year-old whose various mental problems (including anxiety attacks and over-eating) have left him unable to form close bonds with other people. Max decides to write back to Mary and the two become friends. Over time, Mary's increasingly sensitive questions about the adult world give Max progressively worse anxiety attacks and he is ultimately institutionalized. During his time there, Max is diagnosed with depression and Asperger syndrome. Now aware of why he has difficulty relating to other people, Max finds a new lease on life and resumes his correspondence with Mary.
The two remain friends for the next two decades, keeping one another updated on various events in their lives. Mary (Toni Colette), inspired by her friendship with Max, becomes a psychologist and marries her childhood crush, a young Greek Australian man named Damien Popodopoulos (Eric Bana), who enjoys sewing and is at first uncomfortable with Mary's sexual advances. Max wins the New York lottery, using his winnings to buy a (literal) lifetime supply of chocolate and then giving the rest away to his elderly neighbour, who uses most of it to pamper herself before dying and leaving the remainder to a cat shelter, only to have the owner of the shelter take it all for himself.
After earning her degree, Mary writes a psychological book detailing her communication with Max, in an attempt to dissect Asperger syndrome. Max is infuriated, having told Mary that he has come to terms with his illness and sees it as an integral part of his personality, not something that needs to be diagnosed and cured. Max ends his communication with Mary, by breaking the "M" typebar from his typewriter and sending it to her. When Mary receives it, she is heartbroken and has the entire run of the book pulped, effectively ending her budding career. In her despair, Mary takes up her mother's affection for sherry. Chronically depressed and drunk all of the time, one day Mary receives a note from Damien, informing her that he has left her: he has fallen in love with his own pen pal, Desmond, a sheep farmer in New Zealand. In the meantime, Max has decided to forgive Mary and has sent her a gift as a token of his continuing friendship. Mary is so unmanned by her depression and drunkenness, though, that she is unaware of the package that has been sitting on her doorstep for several days. Ultimately, Mary discovers some Valium that had belonged to her mother and, not knowing that she is pregnant, decides to take her own life.
Just as Mary is about to kill herself, her neighbour Len knocks on her door, having conquered his agoraphobia to alert her of the package on her porch. Opening it, Mary finds Max's reconciliation gift along with an accompanying letter detailing the reasons why he forgives her, how much their friendship means to him, and his hope that one day their lives will intersect and they will meet in person. It is enough to jar Mary from her depression and she decides to start her life over again.
One year later, Mary travels to America with her infant son to finally visit Max. Entering his apartment, Mary discovers the now elderly Max, sitting on his couch, gazing upward, having passed away peacefully earlier that morning. Seeing this, Mary returns the "M" typebar to Max's typewriter and sits down next to him with her son. Looking around the apartment, Mary discovers that Max has kept many of the mementos she sent and has organized the entire ceiling into a detailed scrapbook of his friendship with Mary, composed of all of her letters from over the years, which is what he was looking at when he died. Seeing how much Max valued their friendship and how happy it made him, Mary is moved to tears of joy as the film closes.

The film deals with themes including childhood neglect, friendship, the obscurity of life, teasing, loneliness, autism (Asperger syndrome in particular), obesity, suicide,depression and anxiety.
Production.
According to the opening credits, the film is based on a true story. In an interview given in April 2009, writer-director Elliot clarified that the character of Max was inspired by "a pen-friend in New York who I've been writing to for over twenty years."
Principal photography lasted over 57 weeks, using 133 separate sets, 212 puppets, and 475 miniature props, "including a fully functioning Underwood typewriter which apparently took 9 weeks to design and build."
Music.
The music in the film features Simon Jeffes and the Penguin Cafe Orchestra's "Perpetuum Mobile" (the opening theme) and "Prelude and Yodel", as well as "Russian Rag" by Elena Kats-Chernin. The closing-credits music is "A Swingin' Safari" by Bert Kaempfert and his Orchestra. 
Other artists include Nana Mouskouri, Dale Cornelius, Leroy Anderson, Pink Martini, London Pops Orchestra, James Last and his Orchestra, The King's Consort and Choir, the Sydney Alpha Ensemble, and the ABC Radio Orchestra.
Reception.
"Mary and Max" received generally very positive reviews. As of August 2012, 95% (52 of 55) of the critics at the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes rate "Mary and Max" fresh, with six of the seven "Top Critic" reviews agreeing. 
Matt Ravier, writing for "In Film Australia", said the "story is paper-thin and some stretches of it are simply too long, yet whenever the narrative thread threatens to tear the sheer authenticity and bold honesty of the characters save the day." The "Los Angeles Times" called it a "remarkable and poignant" film depicting a "film noir world of blacks, whites and grays for Max and a sepia suburbia for Mary."
After the film was released on DVD in the United States, "Slant" said "Adam Elliot's dry wit is pervasive throughout "Mary and Max" and it's nice to see that this unique sense of humor extends to the extras. The writer-director gives a funny and informative audio commentary and a set of hilarious making-of episodes reflects the sardonic tone of the production. The big prize here, however, is the addition of Elliot's Oscar-winning short "Harvie Krumpet". This Geoffrey Rush-narrated tale of the titular Tourette syndrome sufferer is a wonderful introduction both to Elliot's sensibilities and to "Mary and Max"'s specific tone."
Box office.
"Mary and Max" grossed $1,444,617 at the Australian box office.
The film received no general theatrical release in the United States, though it was showcased at several American film festivals, and was briefly shown at one of the Laemmle Theatres in the Los Angeles area. The film's U.S. distributor (IFC Films) made the film available through video on demand.
The film was released in France by Gaumont and in Germany by MFA to significant critical and box office success.
Awards.
It was awarded the Grand Prize for Best Animated Feature at the 2009 Ottawa International Animation Festival and co-winner (with "Coraline") of the "Cristal" for Best Feature at the 2009 Annecy International Animation Film Festival. The film was also short-listed for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 82nd Academy Awards, but was ultimately not nominated. "Mary and Max" was commended in the Best Australian Film category in the Australian Film Critics Association awards for 2009. The film won the Asia Pacific Screen Award for the Best Animated Feature Film 2009.
Related exhibition.

4-Toluenesulfonyl chloride

4-Toluenesulfonyl chloride (p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, toluene-p-sulfonyl chloride) is an organic compound with the formula CH3C6H4SO2Cl. This white, malodorous solid is a reagent widely used in organic synthesis. Abbreviated TsCl or TosCl, it is a derivative of toluene and contains a sulfonyl chloride (-SO2Cl) functional group.
Uses.
In characteristic manner, TsCl converts alcohols (abbreviated ROH) into the corresponding toluenesulfonate esters, or tosyl derivatives ("tosylates"):
Tosylates can be cleaved with lithium aluminium hydride:
Thus, tosylation followed by reduction allows for removal of a hydroxyl group.
Likewise, TsCl is used to prepare sulfonamides from amines:
The resulting sulfonamides are non-basic and, when derived from primary amines, are even acidic.
The preparation of tosyl esters and amides are conducted in the presence of a base, which absorbs hydrogen chloride. The selection of the base is often crucial to the efficiency of tosylation. Typical bases include pyridine and triethylamine. Unusual bases are also used; for example, catalytic amounts of trimethylammonium chloride in the presence of triethylamine is highly effective by virtue of the trimethylamine.
Other reactions.
Being a widely available reagent, TsCl has been heavily examined from the perspective of reactivity. It is used in dehydrations to make nitriles, isocyanides, diimides. In an unusual reaction focusing on the sulfur center, zinc reduces TsCl to the sulfinate, CH3C6H4SO2Na.
Manufacture.
TsCl is inexpensively available for laboratory use. It is a by-product from the production of o-toluenesulfonyl chloride (a precursor for the synthesis of saccharin), via the chlorosulfonation of toluene:

Game notes.
Orange Bowl.
USC played third ranked Iowa in the Orange Bowl. The matchup featured the top two finalists for that season's Heisman Trophy; Trophy winner Carson Palmer and runner up Brad Banks. Banks was the quarterback for the Hawkeyes. The Hawkeyes had only lost one game all year and it was to their rival Iowa State. Iowa opened the play up with a bang and set an Orange Bowl record when C.J. Jones returned the opening kickoff of the game 100 yards for a touchdown. USC responded with a touchdown run on from running back Justin Fargas. Iowa regained the lead with a field goal from Nate Kaeding. USC would kick a field goal in the second quarter to even the score 10-10 at the half. USC came out in the second half and separated themselves from Iowa scoring twice in the third quarter to take a 24-10 lead. The first score was a pass from Palmer to Mike Williams and the second was another run from Fargas. USC ended the third quarter with the ball and scored quickly in the fourth quarter giving them a 31-10 lead. The lead grew when Iowa continued to be unable to do anything with the ball and USC took advantage on a rushing touchdown from fan favorite Sunny Byrd to make the score 38-10. Iowa would score off a touchdown pass from Banks however it was too late. USC would end up winning 38-17.
The Trojans dominated time of possession in the game, having control of the ball for 38:06 seconds. This allowed for the Trojans defense to rest while keeping the Iowa defense out on the field and making them tired. USC's defense did not give up a touchdown to Iowa until the fourth quarter of the game and forced Banks to throw his first interception since October 19.

Joseph Kalang Tie

Joseph Kalang Tie (born 9 March 1987) is a Malaysian footballer who plays for Malaysia club Sarawak FA in the Premier League and the Malaysia national team. He primarily plays as an attacking midfielder and a winger, although he has also been deployed in central midfield. Joseph is known for his technical ability, creativity, pace, and ability to read the game. Of Borneo heritage, he is described as a player whose "vision and imagination make him an unpredictable opponent". His playing style, ability, and cultural background have drawn comparisons to Sarawak legend Ramos Sari.
Career.
Sarawak FA.
Joseph Kalang Tie is a footballer who plays for Sarawak FA - his home state and the team he started his career with. Joseph is well known for his close control of the ball and good range of passing. He made his first appearance during the 2006/07 season, scoring two league goals and one goal in Malaysia Cup group match against PDRM. At age of 21 (Malaysia Super League 2007-08), Joseph became the youngest player to captain Sarawak.
Out of loan to Hartlepool United.
In October 2008, Joseph Kalang Tie was one of three players selected to attend a two-month training stint with English League One side Hartlepool United.
In Malaysia FA Cup 2009, Joseph scored his first ever senior team hattrick in 6-1 trashing over ATM FA.
He left Sarawak before the start of the 2009 Malaysia Cup seasons despite being the top scorer for the team in all competitions for 2009 seasons. He later joined Terengganu for the 2010 season. and is still regarded highly by their fans despite leaving at the end of the 2012 season. He was affectionately given the nickname "Messi Terengganu" because of his ability on the ball.
Terengganu FA.
In 2011, Joseph won his first silverware with Terengganu after beating Kelantan 2-1 in 2011 Malaysia FA Cup. After 3 years with Terengganu, Joseph returned to Sarawak FA on 30 September 2012, having ended his contract with Terengganu 8 days earlier. He has since continued his fine form and is one of the stars of the Sarawak team who are currently chasing promotion to the Malaysian Super League.
Return to Sarawak FA.
On 7 January, Joseph made his debut return for Sarawak in the 2–1 league opening game win against Perlis at Kangar Stadium.
Style of play.
In his early years at Sarawak FA, Joseph was deployed in several positions, most notably as a deep-lying midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily on the right side as he was deemed too small to play in the middle of the park. After three years of developing his physical traits, in the 2008 season, manager Kunju Jamaluddin inserted Joseph into the playmaker role, where his vision, technical skill, and ability to read and understand the game suited him. Since that season, Joseph has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. The player has personally admitted that playing centrally is his preference. However, as a result of his versatility, Joseph can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Terangganu occupying the role in the team's 4–4–2 formation
International career.
In July 2011, Joseph was called up to represent Malaysia Selection against Chelsea.
Joseph made his international debut for the Malaysia national team in a friendly match with Australia on 7 October 2011, which Malaysia lost heavily 5-0.
