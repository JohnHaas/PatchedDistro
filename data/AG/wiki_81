SM U-22 (Austria-Hungary)

SM "U-22 or U-XXII" was a or U-boat built for and operated by the Austro-Hungarian Navy () during the First World War. The design for "U-22" was based on submarines of the Royal Danish Navy's "Havmanden" class (three of which had been built in Austria-Hungary), and was largely obsolete by the beginning of the war.
"U-22" was just over long and was armed with two bow torpedo tubes, a deck gun, and a machine gun. The submarine was laid down in mid 1915 and launched in January 1917. The still unfinished U-boat sank in the harbor at Fiume in June but was raised, repaired, and relaunched in October. After her commissioning in November, "U-22" patrolled off the Po River estuary and, later, in the northern Adriatic out of Trieste.
After undergoing months of repairs for her failed electric motor in mid 1918, "U-22" returned to duty and patrolled off the Montenegrin coast out of Cattaro in August. At Cattaro at the end of World War I, "U-22" was ceded to France as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920. "U-22" had no wartime successes.
Design and construction.
When it became apparent to the Austro-Hungarian Navy that the First World War would not be a short one, they moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish "Havmanden" class submarines, three of which had been built at Whitehead & Co. in Fiume. Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete, it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards. The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for "U-22" and her three sister boats on 27 March 1915.
"U-22" was one of two boats of the class to be built at the Hungarian UBAG yard in Fiume. Due to demands by the Hungarian government, subcontracts for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, and this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design, resulting in numerous modifications and delays for the class in general.
"U-22" was an ocean-going submarine that displaced surfaced and submerged and was designed for a complement of 18. She was long with a beam of and a draft of . For propulsion, she featured a single shaft, a single diesel engine for surface running, and a single electric motor for submerged travel. She was capable of while surfaced and while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for "U-22", the "Havmanden" class, upon which the "U-20" class was based, had a range of at , surfaced, and at submerged.
"U-22" was armed with two torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. She was also equipped with a 66 mm/26 (2.6 in) deck gun and an machine gun.
"U-22" was laid down at Fiume in mid 1915 and launched on 27 January 1917, the last of the four "U-20"-class boats to be launched. On 10 June, while not yet complete, the U-boat sank in the harbor at Fiume. Raised from her resting point at a depth of the following day, "U-22" underwent four months of repairs. She was launched again on 6 October.
Service career.
On 18 November 1917 the U-boat sailed for Pola, where she was commissioned as SM "U-22" on 23 November under the command of "Linienschiffsleutnant" Josef Holub. The 31-year-old Galician had been assigned to "U-22" in February and had been in charge of sister boat from June 1916 until his assignment to "U-22".
Holub led "U-22" out on her first patrol when they departed Pola on 5 December for duty off the Po estuary. After returning to Pola on 10 December, Holub led "U-22" on another Po estuary tour from 15 to 17 December. On 29 December, Holub was transferred to . His replacement was "Linienschiffsleutnant" Friedrich Sterz. It was the first U-boat command of the 25-year-old native of Pergine, Tyrolia (in present-day Italy).
On 3 January 1918, Sterz returned "U-22" to the Po estuary for a third patrol there. While in the area, an enemy submarine was spotted but no attack could be made because of bad weather; the same bad weather forced "U-22" to put in at Rovigno the following day. Setting out from Rovigno on 5 January, "U-22" unsuccessfully attacked an Italian torpedo boat and two steamships. After a return to Rovigno on 6 January, Sterz steered his boat to the submarine base at Brioni. Ten days later, "U-22" headed to Trieste, where she conducted patrols in the northern Adriatic. On 5 February, "U-22" avoided being hit by seven bombs dropped by an enemy airplane. Departing the northern Adriatic in late April, "U-22" was headed for Cattaro when her electric motor failed. After a quick stop at Cattaro, "U-22" returned to Pola for three months of repairs.
After returning to service in August, "U-22" operated out of Catttaro, patrolling off the Montenegrin coast over the next two months. On 17 October, the boat returned to Cattaro, where she remained until the war's end. She was ceded to France as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920. Like all of her sister boats, "U-22" had no wartime successes.

Sermitsiaq (newspaper)

Sermitsiaq (Greenlandic for "Saddle Mountain") is one of two national newspapers in Greenland. It is named after the mountain Sermitsiaq.
The newspaper was published for the first time May 21, 1958, as a Kalaallisut-language alternative to the Danish-language newspaper "Mikken". The two magazines were printed separately, with Mikken on Saturdays and Sermitsiaq on Mondays for about six months, until Mikken was published for the last time on 22 November the same year. "Sermitsiaq" was first printed in both Danish and Kalaallisut the week before "Mikken" closed down. 
Sermitsiaq was a local newspaper distributed only in Nuuk city until around 1980 when the newspaper became national. The newspaper became increasingly political in the period around 1980, since Greenland was granted home rule in 1979.
The newspaper is published every Friday, while the online version is updated several times daily.
In 2010 "Sermitsiaq" merged with "Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten" ("AG"), the other Greenlandic newspaper. Both papers' websites now redirect to the combined Sermitsiaq.AG homepage.

Chill (film)

Chill is a multi-award-winning 2007 independent low budget horror film written and directed by Serge Rudnunsky that stars Thomas Calabro, Ashley Laurence, Shaun Kurtz and James Russo.
Development and Plot.
The film was based on H.P. Lovecraft's "Cool Air". Similar plot elements include the fact that the doctor in the film (played by Shaun Kurtz) is named Dr. Muñoz as in Lovecraft's story, and must live in refrigerated conditions in order to survive. There is also a mention of the Necronomicon in the film; while this does not occur in Lovecraft's "Cool Air", it does serve in the movie as a clue to its Lovecraftian inspiration. Part of the plot hinges on the refigeration system breaking down, again as in the Lovecraft story. Physically the character of Dr Muñoz in the film does not resemble the character described in Lovcecraft's story, nor does he speak with a Spanish accent. 
Overall, however, the plot of the movie moves away from the Lovecraft story in depicting Muñoz as the controller of a serial killer who preys on prostitutes. Muñoz lives in the back of a deli which he runs, and the protagonist Sam Thomas Calabro, a writer who comes to work at the deli for survival money, gets dragged into the web of killings. Sam also falls in love with a woman named Maria Ashley Laurence who runs a clothing stores across the street and is being threatened by a local cop, Detective Defazio James Russo who she dated once.
The DVD packaging for the Australian release through Flashback Entertainment does not feature Lovecraft's name anywhere, though the American packaging indicates that Lovecraft's tale inspired the movie. The film is omitted from Charles P. Mitchell's otherwise fairly comprehensive "The Complete H.P. Lovecraft Filmography" (Greenwood Press, 2001), possibly because the makers of "Chill" did not overtly capitalise on Lovecraft's name. 
The "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" summarizes the plot as "Let's just say someone dies but cheats Death by harvesting flesh and dabbling in the occult."
Reception.
The film won Best Achievement in Fantasy and Horror at the Worldfest International Film Festival, was nominated for Best Horror Feature Film at the Shockerfest International Film Festival, and was an Official Selection at both the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival and World Horror Convention in Toronto. DVD Verdict gave the film a reasonably complimentary review, while "Home Theater Info" is definitely praiseful of the film asking readers of the review to "give this movie a chance and enjoy." "Slasherpool.com" presents a bit more balanced view of the film describing a number of positives (the casting and directing) and negatives (the pacing and atmosphere). Oddly enough, the DVD box art includes a quotation from the more balanced "Slasherpool.com" review: ""Saw" meets "Nosferatu"."

Madsen LAR

The Madsen LAR was a battle rifle of Danish origin chambered in the 7.62mm NATO calibre. It was made from lightweight high tensile alloys and steel similar to that used on the M16 rifle and its layout is based on a number of rifles such as the GRAM 63 and the Valmet M62. Development of the Madsen LAR has its traces back to 1962 when various arms manufacturers like FN Herstal and H&K were producing the FN FAL and G3.
Variants.
Variants of the LAR came with solid wood stocks that covered the receiver from the handguard to the buttplate, then with fixed steel tube and side/underfolding stocks. An assault rifle variant chambered in the 7.62x39mm M43 round was intended for the armed forces of Finland to purge them away from using a Soviet based design, the Valmet M62 based on the AK-47. However, Finland being a neutral country ignored this and went ahead with the Valmet M62 adopting it as their standard service rifle as it was cheaper to produce, reliable as the Madsen LAR and overall their own design.

William Doud Packard

William Doud Packard (November 3, 1861 – November 11, 1923) was an American automobile manufacturer who founded the Packard Motor Car Company and Packard Electric Company with his brother James Ward Packard.
Life and career.
Born in Warren, Ohio, the Packard brothers founded Packard Electric Company there in 1890 and manufactured incandescent carbon arc lamps.
After disappointment with a Winton Company car he purchased, James formed a partnership with his brother and Winton investor George L. Weiss called Packard & Weiss. The first Packard automobile was released in 1899. In 1900, the company incorporated as the Ohio Automobile Company and was renamed the Packard Motor Car Company in 1902. The company relocated to Detroit in 1903. The company eventually merged with the Studebaker Corporation in 1954, and the last Packard was made in 1958.
Following the company relocation to Detroit, the Packard brothers focused on making automotive electrical systems through the Packard Electric Company. General Motors acquired the company in 1932, renaming it Delphi Packard Electric Systems in 1995. The company was spun off and became independent of GM in 1999. 
In 1915, W.D. Packard commissioned a summer home to be designed by a famous architectural firm in New York City, Warren and Wetmore. This home is located on the Chautauqua Institution. It still serves as a single-family residence. There is a duplicate in Warren, Ohio.
Packard Park in Warren, Ohio is on land donated by Packard, and the W.D. Packard Music Hall and Packard Band were funded by him.

Robert Thompson (1840 – 21 April 1922) was a Member of Parliament for Marsden, in Northland, New Zealand.
Early life.
Born at Newtown Butler, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, Thompson migrated to New South Wales in 1864 and New Zealand in 1870. He was a commission agent and auctioneer in Whangarei. He married Mary Catherine Aubrey, eldest daughter of Harcourt Richard Aubrey, Resident Magistrate for Kaipara and Whangarei, in 1879.
Member of Parliament.
Robert Thompson represented Marsden in the House of Representatives for fifteen years from to 1902.
According to Wilson, he changed his political allegiance; initially a Conservative he was a Liberal in , but in was Independent and in was an Independent Liberal but was not part of the governing Liberal Government.
He acquired the labels 'Marsden Thompson' and 'the member for roads and bridges' in Parliament. He was known for his devotion to the interests of his district, which was desperately in need of good roads, and his only reason for being a Liberal was that the government was the only source of funding for roads and bridges. He was pro-freehold (land), and was opposed to Liberal policies such as labour legislation and old age pensions. In , when he stood unsuccessfully for Auckland West against a sitting Liberal member, he was once more an Independent, and his programme – freehold (land), acquisition of Maori land and opposition to prohibition had not altered.
Death.
He died on 21 April 1922 at his residence, Pentland House, in Whangarei, and was buried at Kamo. His wife had died some 18 years before him. He was survived by one daughter.

Molybdenum cofactor deficiency

Molybdenum cofactor deficiency is a rare human disease in which the absence of molybdenum cofactor leads to accumulation of toxic levels of sulphite and neurological damage. Usually this leads to death within months of birth, due to the lack of active sulfite oxidase. Furthermore, a mutational block in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis causes absence of enyzme activity of xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase and aldehyde oxidase.
When caused by a mutation in the MOCS1 gene it is the type A variant. It can also be caused by a mutation in the MOCS2 gene or the GEPH gene. As of 2010, there had been approximately 132 reported cases.
It should not be confused with molybdenum deficiency.
Diagnosis.
Diagnosis of Molybdenum cofactor deficiency includes early seizures, low blood levels of uric acid, and high levels of sulphite, xanthine, and uric acid in urine. Additionally, the disease produces characteristic MRI images that can aid in diagnosis.
Breakthrough.
In 2009, Monash Children's Hospital at Southern Health in Melbourne, Australia reported that a patient known as Baby Z became the first person to be successfully treated for molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A. The patient was treated with cPMP, a precursor of the molybdenum cofactor. Baby Z will require daily injections of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) for the rest of her life.

Embassy Court

Embassy Court is an 11-storey block of luxury flats on the seafront in Brighton, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove. It has been listed at Grade II* by English Heritage. Wells Coates' "extremely controversial" piece of Modernist architecture has "divided opinion across the city" since its completion in 1935, and continues to generate strong feelings among residents, architectural historians and conservationists.
The flats were originally let at high rents to wealthy residents, including Max Miller, Rex Harrison and Terence Rattigan, and features such as enclosed balconies and England's first penthouse suites made the 72-apartment, 11-storey building "one of the most desirable and sought-after addresses in Brighton and Hove". Its fortunes changed dramatically from the 1970s, though, as a succession of complex court cases set leaseholders, freeholders and landlords against each other while the building rotted. By the start of the 21st century it was an "embarrassing eyesore" which was close to being demolished, despite its listed status. Proposals to refurbish the block came to nothing until the court cases concluded in 2004 and Sir Terence Conran's architectural practice was brought in. With an investment of £5 million, raised partly by the residents, Embassy Court was overhauled: by 2006 it had been restored to its original status as a high-class residence, in contrast to its poor late-20th-century reputation.
History.
At the junction of Western Street and Kings Road on Brighton seafront, just on the Brighton side of the ancient parish boundary between Brighton and Hove, stood a 19th-century villa called Western House. Owners included Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor and the drag king Vesta Tilley. In 1930 the site was chosen for redevelopment and the building and its grounds were demolished. Nothing took its place immediately, though, except for a temporary racetrack and miniature golf course. Developers Maddox Properties acquired the site and in 1934 enlisted Wells Coates, a Modernist architect responsible for the striking Isokon building in London earlier that year, to design a block of luxury flats as a speculative development. Embassy Court was completed in 1935. Its reinforced concrete structure and steel-framed doors and windows were distinctive features, and other facilities included a ground-floor bank, partly enclosed balconies to every one of the 72 flats, and England's first penthouse suites. These occupied the top (11th) floor; the other ten storeys had seven flats each. Each flat was "all-electric", including the space heating in the form of ceiling panels. A constant hot water supply was achieved by generating and storing it in a thermal energy storage system in the basement. Coates commented: "Old ideas have been discarded and a new building has arisen to greet a new age that thinks of happiness in terms of health".
The building's height and bold appearance, "something like a great ocean liner", contrasted with the Regency-style terraces to the east, west and north—in particular the 110-year-old "palace-fronted terraces" of Brunswick Terrace, "as grand as anything in St Petersburg", and the monumental Brunswick Square behind it. It received much praise at first: a 1936 edition of the "Architects' Journal" claimed that the building "thrill one to the marrow", and Alderman Sir Herbert Carden, "the maker of modern Brighton" who was responsible for many interwar improvements in the Borough of Brighton, was so taken with its Modernist style that he campaigned for every other building along the seafront to be demolished and replaced with Embassy Court-style housing, all the way from Hove to Kemp Town. Writing in 1935, in a piece accompanied by a large illustration of Embassy Court-style buildings along Kings Road, he wrote "Embassy Court ... has shown us the way to build for the new age. Along our waterfront new buildings such as this must come". This "pre-war indifference to the historic fabric of the town" resulted in the first of many local conservation societies, the Regency Society, being formed, and prompted a greater appreciation of Brighton's 19th-century architectural heritage.
All 72 flats were initially rented out rather than sold to owner-occupiers. Rents varied between £150 and £500 per year—expensive for that time, and similar to the cost of a house in Brighton. The ground-floor bank branch lasted until February 1948, when it was converted into a restaurant; this was only in use for five years. Major renovations were then carried out in the 1960s: new doors, windows and lifts were installed.
The building's high-class status declined from the 1970s when the freehold changed hands frequently and many flats were acquired by absentee landlords. Many leaseholders built up long-term rent arrears, and lack of clarity over ownership made raising money for refurbishment difficult. Embassy Court gradually fell into disrepair. The freeholder until 1997 was a company called Portvale; it was put into liquidation when a court case resulted in a demand to spend £1.5 million on maintenance. The Crown Estate Commissioners then took possession of the freehold, but Embassy Court's leaseholders established a company, Bluestorm Ltd, to buy it; this was achieved after another court case.
The first plans for refurbishing the building were announced in April 1998. The leaseholders' association commissioned local architects Alan Phillips and Matthew Lloyd to undertake design work and Ove Arup and Partners for their structural engineering expertise. Work was expected to cost £3 million to £4 million, of which a grant from the Government's Single Regeneration Budget would have covered £1.4 million. The project depended on the Sanctuary Housing Association acquiring the leases to 26 flats and the Crown Estate Commissioners transferring ownership of the freehold to the leaseholders' association. The proposed work was described as a "complete refurbishment" and would have lasted until 2000.
No action was taken, though, and the building continued to deteriorate. Architect Alan Phillips, who had continued his association with the building during the "impasse in negotiations" which had characterised the previous three years, described Embassy Court as being "on the cusp between demolition and renovation" at a debate in November 2001, at which he announced a new plan to convert the lower storeys into a hotel. Money generated by this could then be used to improve the upper storeys, which would remain residential. The nearby Bedford Hotel provided a model of a mixed-use tower block with hotel accommodation below residential flats.
Another court case began in November 2002. Bluestorm and Portvale Holdings made claims against each other in relation to paying for the building's restoration. By this stage Bluestorm estimated the cost of a full refurbishment would be £4.5 million. Portvale Holdings stated it intended to sell the flats it owned, and a former director of the liquidated Portvale company later stated he did not wish to buy the freehold back from Bluestorm. The case was adjourned after two weeks and was decided in March 2003 in favour of Bluestorm. The chairman of Brighton and Hove City Council said he "welcomed the decision". Portvale Holdings appealed against the decision in February 2004, but a judge at the Royal Courts of Justice upheld the original verdict. This brought to a conclusion a long and complex period of legal action; the judge observed that the ongoing battles between leaseholders, landlords and freeholders had been "more suited to a nursery school playground".
In July 2003, Bluestorm announced a new refurbishment plan, this time involving Sir Terence Conran's Conran Group architectural consultancy. The scheme architect was Paul Zara. Conran Group undertook a structural survey which showed that the concrete walls had not deteriorated as badly as expected: its director said that the building was in "a very poor state perfectly salvageable". The expected cost was £5 million, and various sources of funding were proposed: money received from Portvale Holdings and from the leaseholders was to be used alongside National Lottery and European Union regeneration grants for which Bluestorm would apply. Also commissioned alongside Conran Group were structural engineering firm F.J. Samuely, whose founder Felix Samuely had worked on the building originally, and some other specialist companies. By September 2003, Conran had assembled a working group of engineers, designers and other professionals, and the plans included provision of a swimming pool and public facilities such as a restaurant, museum and art gallery by making use of underused areas of the building.
Work began in December 2003. First, the communal areas and lobby were deep-cleaned and exterior hoardings were put up; other early priorities included new electrical and heating systems. The overall timescale of the project was stated to be three years. At that time, the leaseholders were told they would have to fund the entire £5 million estimated cost themselves: some would have to pay around £100,000 each. Also, the project leader indicated that the planned swimming pool, art gallery and other new features would be "put on hold until 2007". By February 2004, the bulk of the work was expected to start in summer 2004. Bluestorm raised a planning application, and Brighton and Hove City Council granted outline permission in June 2004. New windows, doors, plumbing and heating, repairs to the concrete structure and re-rendering the exterior were all prioritised at this time.
The first part of the refurbishment project was completed on time and on budget. After a delay caused by poor weather, the exterior hoardings and scaffolding were removed in early April 2005 to reveal new windows and a "smart cream concrete façade". Bluestorm managed to raise some funds towards the cost, so leaseholders ended up paying £65,000 each. The second phase involved repairs at the rear, the promised replacement plumbing and heating systems, new lifts and new front doors, and was due to finish in September 2005. The longer-term proposal for a basement swimming pool remained, and other ideas suggested at this time included a gymnasium, reinstatement of the original 1930s foyer decor including a mural by Edward McKnight Kauffer, and the conversion of one flat into a 1930s-style showpiece. Bluestorm organised a party on the Brunswick Lawns outside Embassy Court in September 2006 to celebrate the completion of the work. Local record label Skint Records led a separate private party on the top floor of the building. Public tours were also conducted later in the month. The earlier problems of poor security had been overcome, and Embassy Court was no longer "a haven for drunks, drug addicts and homeless people".
Architecture and facilities.
Embassy Court represented a transition from the pure Art Deco style which had been popular in the early 1930s, towards a "simplistic and plain" interpretation of Modernism. In this respect it is similar to the Grand Ocean Hotel at nearby Saltdean; and the style appears again further west in Hove, albeit in brick, in the form of the mansion block at 4 Grand Avenue and the "severely Moderne" Viceroy Lodge. The "Pevsner Architectural Guides" describe Embassy Court as "Brighton's most prominent example of early Modernism at its most polished". There are similarities with Coates' Isokon building, but on a larger scale and in a more "nautical, streamlined" style. Coates was influenced by the designs of architect Erich Mendelsohn during a visit to Germany in 1931–32, and some of the building's design features recall Mendelsohn's work.
The building is tall, wide and rises to 11 storeys. Reinforced concrete painted a pale cream colour is the main building material. It is -shaped but with a distinctively curved southeastern corner. The east (Western Street) façade is longer. Both faces (towards Kings Road and towards Western Street) have a strongly horizontal emphasis formed by the continuous bands of cantilevered balconies on each floor. The horizontal emphasis is partly offset by the "nice vertical rhythm" of the slightly curving windows of the sun rooms; this effect is most noticeable on the east elevation. The cream-coloured render was lost for many years because of the building's deteriorating condition, but it was restored during the Conran Partners' work and the exterior now looks as it did in the 1930s.
To the rear, the cantilevered effect is maintained, forming "access decks" which sweep diagonally upwards at the ends to house the external staircases. The lift shafts also punctuate the mostly horizontal tiers. The upper storeys (from ninth floor level upwards) are slightly recessed; the architectural theory of contextualism would suggest that this device would have been more effective had it started at fifth-floor level, matching the height of neighbouring Brunswick Terrace.
Embassy Court was the first building in England to feature penthouse suites. Other pioneering features included open-fronted balconies, lock-up garages and what the original managing agents Dudley Samuel and Harrison described as "sun-admitting Vista-Glass sun parlours". Many of the "sun rooms" have been integrated into the flats to create extra living space. Another unique feature was a mural by Edward McKnight Kauffer in the foyer. It was created by a new method in which a series of black-and-white photographs were printed on a light-sensitive cellulose surface. The flats had built-in steel-framed tubular furniture (manufactured by Pel Ltd) and woodwork by D. Burkle & Son.
Reception and legacy.
Embassy Court has been a controversial building and "has divided opinion across the city" since it was built. "Unashamedly modern and different" from its surroundings, it was "the first challenge to the Georgian[-era] architecture of Brighton". Architectural historians Antony Dale and Nikolaus Pevsner both observed that Embassy Court is "a good building in the wrong place", in relation to its position adjoining the Brunswick Town development. Dale noted that the latter's "carefully regulated proportions" are overpowered by the unsympathetic form of its 11-storey neighbour, making Embassy Court "a glaring example of architectural bad manners and worse town planning". Nevertheless, he described it as "a good building of its period" and compared favourably with most blocks of flats built subsequently. Pevsner called Embassy Court "a good and historically interesting" building", "well designed in itself"—but criticised it as acting as a "bad neighbour" to the "serious Neoclassical of Brunswick Town. Likewise, Brighton historian Clifford Musgrave contrasted Embassy Court with its near-contemporary, Marine Gate, to the east beyond Kemp Town; although it was "another white concrete block of flats", he considered it more elegant and better because it did not intrude directly on any 19th-century architectural set-pieces. It is an early an example of early Modernist architecture in England, and "one of the very few [such buildings in the Sussex area". Former Mayor of Brighton Lord Lewis Cohen said in 1953: "It stands as a monument for all time to the lack of foresight of those who permitted such a conglomeration of architecture on our seafront."
Embassy Court was Brighton's first tower block. Although "it seemed to some that the era of skyscrapers had started" locally—especially in the light of Herbert Carden's proposals for the seafront—it was only in the 1960s that multi-storey towers began to dominate the skyline of Brighton and Hove. Journalist Adam Trimingham has commented that these postwar buildings have been characteristically "drab" and that "nothing was built to match Embassy Court".
By the start of the 21st century, public perception of Embassy Court was particularly poor: it was considered to be an "embarrassing eyesore", "a filthy blot on the seafront", a "grimy, rotting structure" and "like something from the Third World". Windows were falling out; wind, damp and noise were constant problems; and on one occasion some exterior cladding fell off and landed in the street. The third edition of "The Cheeky Guide to Brighton", published in 2003, claimed Embassy Court looked like "Michael Jackson's face on a bad day". Meanwhile, the views articulated by Pevsner continued to find support. Writing in 2002, Anthony Seldon condemned both Embassy Court for "dwarfand insult[ing its neighbours" and Herbert Carden for considering it "the ideal seafront building". Although Seldon placed it in his list of "the city's ten best 20th-century buildings"—describing it as "elegant", "vibrant and visually exciting"—and compared it favourably to the contemporary Marine Gate flats further along the seafront, he observed that it was "utterly out of place on the seafront" and should have been lower by three storeys. Furthermore, in a section consisting of ideas for the future of Brighton and Hove, he suggested "knockdown Embassy Court, Hilton West Pier and other excrescences along the seafront [and hold a series of parties to celebrate"—recalling the demolition campaigns seen in some Majorcan seaside resorts.
Artist and musician Chris Dooks released a concept album inspired by Embassy Court in 2005. After discovering the building by chance when browsing the internet, he became interested in its history and contacted Bluestorm Ltd. He became Embassy Court's artist-in-residence and produced a four-track EP called "Sycamore Tubs". Its name and all four tracks are anagrams of Embassy Court, as is "As Ruby's Comet"—an artwork he produced at the same time. The 2005 fantasy film "MirrorMask" was filmed partly at Embassy Court.
Embassy Court was listed at Grade II* on 19 July 1984. As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove.
Notable residents.
Keith Waterhouse moved into the building in 1983 and occupied a ninth-floor flat, but left in 1992 and moved to Bath. He drew comparison between Embassy Court and "an East End slum". Brighton-born comedian Max Miller and actor Rex Harrison were two early residents; Sir Terence Rattigan rented a flat there as well from 1960, but disliked it and soon moved to Marine Parade.

Hell and Back (comics)

Hell and Back is a nine-issue comic book limited series, first published by Dark Horse Comics in July 1999–April 2000, and the seventh volume in Frank Miller's "Sin City" series.
Plot.
It tells the story of Wallace, an artist/war hero/short order cook who saves a suicidal woman named Esther. She likes his art and they go out for a drink. They are ambushed by two men, who drug Wallace and kidnap Esther. Apparently, The Colonel and Liebowitz are a part of this conspiracy. Wallace spends the night in the drunk tank, after being dragged out of the gutter by two of Basin City's (notoriously corrupt) police officers, Manson and Bundy, and upon his release seeks out Esther. He is crossed once again by a squad of police officers after he tells Commissioner Liebowitz he plans to find Esther alone if need be, and proceeds to dispatch them with humiliating ease, leaving them bound, naked and without money. After locating Esther's home via his landlady, (she'd taken her address) he finds her apartment occupied by Delia, who claims to be Esther's roommate.
Wallace and Delia are attacked by The Colonel's new manservant, Manute, but they escape after Wallace beats him in hand-to-hand combat and defenestrates him (a reference to a similar scene from "A Dame To Kill For"). Then a sniper attacks from a nearby window, whom Wallace takes out by shooting him through the scope of his rifle, similar to a scene from "RoboCop 2" (also written by Miller). All the while, Delia tries unsuccessfully to seduce him as they are pursued by two more assassins in a Mercedes, which Wallace also disposes of.
Afterwards, Wallace meets up with an old war buddy referred to only as Captain. He borrows an old Chevrolet Nomad known as The Heap from him and Wallace and Delia turn in for the night at the Last Hope Motel (a reference to Nancy Callahan's car and the place where she and John Hartigan hide in "That Yellow Bastard"). 
Wallace handcuffs her to the bed for what she believes is foreplay, when he reveals that he knows she cannot be Esther's roommate, since Esther's clothes would have the smell of Delia's cigarettes on them. Just then, Wallace is drugged by a sniper for the second time. He wakes at the Santa Yolanda Tar Pits, where Delia, Gordo, and a drug wizard named Maxine are preparing to abandon his car in the pits. Maxine gives him a huge dose of something strange and Wallace goes on a trip. 
A large portion of the comic, wherein he finds himself hallucinating, is then done in full color, similar to Miller's work on "Ronin" and "" saga, (all colored by Lynn Varley, his wife). After a surreal sequence involving a crashing fighter jet, trash-talking cherubs and dinosaurs, the car hits a tree. He discovers a young girl dead in the trunk, intended to frame him, and, since he can only perceive the girl as a battered Raggedy Ann doll, he declares that "just this once, I'm grateful for the drugs". The police show up, as does Captain, who kills the police. Captain explains he'd have gotten there sooner if it wasn't for snipers establishing a perimeter. They torture the one remaining sniper, (as did Dwight in "The Big Fat Kill",) and find out where Delia, Gordo, and Maxine were heading and pursue them. During this sequence the Captain morphs into various pop culture icons, including King Leonidas from Frank Miller's "300", Lone Wolf and Cub, an ED-209 droid from the RoboCop movies, Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot, Captain America, Dirty Harry, John Rambo, Martha Washington from "Give Me Liberty", Hagar the Horrible and even Hellboy. This portion is entirely in color.
They shoot past Delia, Maxine and Gordo at a gas station where they were refilling the Humvee they were driving. As they begin driving again, Wallace and Captain ambush them, with Captain disabling the Hummer with a rocket launcher. As they move in, Gordo mortally wounds Captain as Wallace shoots Gordo in the face. At gunpoint, Wallace makes Maxine bring him out of his hallucination hell. As she does, he shoots her in the head and shoots Delia through the gut when he suffers a panic attack. After blacking out for a few seconds, Wallace finds himself back in a black and white "normal" world, Maxine dead and Delia wounded. Paralyzed from the waist down, and genuinely fearful, she begs him to have mercy on her, and as a last act of chivalry Wallace does so by shooting her in the back of her head (she never sees what hits her). He then carries Captain's body back to the Heap and drives away. 
He meets up with another war buddy named Jerry, the Captain's lover. They burn Captain's body in a funeral pyre, where afterwards they work trying to flush the rest of the drugs out of Wallace's system. Mariah, another female mercenary working for The Colonel, is assigned to Delia's task in her stead. The Colonel is now killing anyone linking Wallace to him, starting with the doctor who kidnapped Esther. He even has Mariah break Liebowitz's teenage son's arm after luring him away from his high school. He then threatens Liebowitz's family even further, putting the commissioner in a moral quandary. 
Wallace confronts Liebowitz in his apartment and tries to get him to join his side. Wallace discovers that the real scheme The Colonel is operating is a slave trafficking and organ harvesting ring of which Liebowitz was in fact (intentionally or otherwise) unaware of. Wallace explains how he launched a one-man assault on the factory, first infiltrating the complex, cutting a swathe of stealthy death through the roster of guards and discovering the myriad atrocities going on there. He was then confronted by Mariah and The Colonel as well as many, many armed guards. Wallace managed to escape the factory with his own life but without saving anyone, much to his own chagrin. 
At this point, the phone rings in Liebowitz's apartment: "They know you're here", Liebowitz tells Wallace. It's The Colonel, telling Wallace where Esther is: she is at the Roark family farm, long since abandoned at this point. The deal is simple: Wallace's silence for Esther's safe return. When Wallace finds her, an enemy helicopter arrives and opens fire, Wallace shielding Esther with his body. However, Wallace is one step ahead: Jerry, who was up on a hill with heavy ordnance, blasts the chopper out of the sky with a rocket launcher; Wallace, who was wearing a Kevlar vest, survived the chopper's machinegun fire miraculously. Wallace takes Esther to the hospital and he and Jerry prepare to make a second assault on The Colonel's base of operations, when a flood of people are brought in on stretchers. 
By this time, the police have launched a massive raid on The Colonel's factory, where The Colonel is captured. The Colonel threatens Liebowitz, who in return shoots him in the head for hurting his son and tells his underlings to "make a "missing person" outta the fucker". Wallenquist (the criminal lord behind the whole operation) lets it all be square, against the strong wishes of Mariah, (who somehow escaped the factory raid,) seeing neither power nor profit in revenge; He seeks revenge on neither Wallace nor Liebowitz. 
Weeks later, Wallace and Esther leave town. He asks her why she wanted to jump and she responds "I was lonely". They drive away towards a better life away from Sin City.

LGBT hip hop

LGBT hip hop, also known as by names such as homo hop or queer hip hop, is a genre of hip hop music performed by LGBT artists and performers. It has been described as "a global movement of gay hip-hop MCs and fans determined to stake their claim in a genre too often associated with homophobia and anti-gay lyrics."
The genre is not marked by a specific production style — artists within it may simultaneously be associated with virtually any other subgenre of hip hop — but rather by a lyrical focus on LGBT themes.
History.
The genre first emerged in the 1990s as an underground movement, particularly in the American state of California. Initially coined by Tim'm T. West of Deep Dickollective, the term "homo hop" was not meant to signify a distinct genre of music, but simply to serve as a community building and promotional tool for LGBT artists. According to West:
West's bandmate Juba Kalamka offered a similar assessment:
Notable events in the 2000s included the PeaceOUT World Homo Hop Festival, which was founded in 2001 and mounted annually until 2008, and the 2006 documentary film "Pick Up the Mic".
By the early 2010s, a new wave of openly LGBT hip hop musicians began to emerge, spurred in part by the increased visibility and social acceptance of LGBT people, the coming out of mainstream hip hop stars such as Azealia Banks and Frank Ocean and the release of LGBT-positive songs by heterosexual artists such as Murs, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, and Adair Lion. Although inspired and empowered by the homo hop movement, this newer generation of artists garnered more mainstream media coverage and were able to make greater use of social networking tools to build their audience, and thus did not need to rely on the old homo hop model of community building. Many of these artists were also strongly influenced by the LGBT African American ball culture, an influence not widely seen in the first wave of homo hop, and many began as performance art projects and incorporated the use of drag. Accordingly, many of the newer artists were identified in media coverage with the newer "queer hip hop" label instead of "homo hop".
In March 2012, Carrie Battan of Pitchfork profiled Mykki Blanco, Le1f, Zebra Katz and House of LaDosha in an article titled "We Invented Swag: NYC Queer Rap" about "a group of NYC artists are breaking down ideas of hip-hop identity".
In October 2012, "Details" profiled several LGBT hip hop artists "indelibly changing the face—and sound—of rap".

Renegade DEA agent and former NYPD officer Max Payne attempts to hunt down the ones responsible for murdering his wife and child, as well as framing him for the murder of his partner, Alex Balder. As the story unfolds he gains a number of "allies"—most of whom are killed off in the sequel—including a Russian mafia gangster, called Vladimir Lem, and Mona Sax, a female vigilante who's out to avenge the death of her twin sister, Lisa, and manages to bring down the ring-leaders in a major drug-operation for a narcotic called "V" or Valkyr—after the mythological figures in Norse mythology.
"Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne".
Max Payne has been taken by the police and is about to face charges for his killing spree. However, he was eventually cleared of all charges, thanks to his relationship with a very influential member of society, Senator Alfred Woden. A few years have passed, and Max has returned to work for the NYPD as a homicide detective. However, during a routine murder investigation he finds himself face-to-face once again with the fugitive Mona Sax, a woman he thought was dead. Max and Mona team up to solve the answers to Max's past that left his wife and child dead.
"Max Payne 3".
Max Payne has now left both the NYPD and New York itself and is now working on a private security detail in São Paulo, Brazil. However, when the wife of his employer is kidnapped by a local street gang, Max and his old friend Raul Passos join forces in an attempt to rescue her, igniting a war that will lead them to confront a large conspiracy. 
Film adaptation.
Early in 2003, it was confirmed that 20th Century Fox had bought the rights to adapt the game to film. The "Max Payne" movie went into production in 2008 and was directed by John Moore. The movie was produced by Collision Entertainment and Firm Films in Toronto, Canada. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis play the roles of Max Payne and Mona Sax respectively. Beau Bridges, Chris O'Donnell, Nelly Furtado and rapper Ludacris have roles as B.B. Hensley, Jason Colvin, Christa Balder and Jim Bravura respectively.

The film was released to theaters in the USA on October 17, 2008 with a PG-13 rating. While it was ranked first on its opening weekend, grossing US$18 million at the box office, the film received mainly negative reviews, having a 16% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 129 reviews.
Fan films.
Fan-made short films include "Max Payne: Hero" (Chris Chen, 2003) and "Max Payne: The Beginning of the End" (Zapruder Pictures Production, 2006).
There is an independent movie project "Payne and Redemption" which has been in production for years and currently continues. On April 2008, 20th Century Fox sent a letter to writer and director Fergle Gibson, asking for the immediate "cease and desist" of his work. Due to the possibility of having the film studio begin legal actions against him for the non consented use of the brand Max Payne, he decided to take out the name of the character from the title and movie plot.
Another new fan short film "Max Payne: Valhalla" was released in May 2012. This project was financed by crowdfunding.

Forrabury and Minster

Forrabury and Minster is a civil parish on the north coast of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The parish was originally divided between the coastal parish of Forrabury and inland parish of Minster until they were united in 1779. 
The parish is in the Registration District of Camelford. It is bounded to the north by the Atlantic; to the east by the parishes of St Juliot, Lesnewth and Davidstow; to the south by Camelford parish (ecclesiastical parish of Lanteglos by Camelford); and to the west by Trevalga parish. The population of Forrabury and Minster parish in the 2001 census was 888.
Settlements and churches.
Boscastle is the principal settlement in the parish of Forrabury and Minster. It is 14 miles (23 kilometres) south of Bude and 5 miles (8 kilometres) north-east of Tintagel. Forrabury parish church, dedicated to St Symphorian, is in Boscastle at .
However, the mother church of Boscastle is dedicated to St Materiana and nestles among the trees of Minster Wood in the valley of the River Valency half-a-mile east of Boscastle at . The original Forrabury / Minster boundary crossed the river so the harbour end of the village was in Forrabury and the upriver area in Minster. The churches were established some time earlier than the settlement at Boscastle (in Norman times when a castle was built there). The Celtic name of Minster was Talkarn but it was renamed Minster in Anglo-Saxon times because of a monastery on the site. Until the Reformation St Materiana's tomb was preserved in the church. (Another spelling of her name sometimes used is 'Mertheriana' but the usual Latin form is Materiana.) In 1187 the advowson of Forrabury Church was granted to the newly founded Hartland Abbey by William de Botreaux of Boscastle, who also gave the Abbey the advowsons of other of his manors in Devon. For many years the Anglican parishes of Forrabury and Minster have been in the charge of a Rector who is responsible for a group of adjoining parishes as well as these. Minster Church was damaged by the flood of August 2004 and in the following year archaeological work was done at the church to obtain a clearer idea of the history of the building.
Notable buildings and antiquities.
Minster church was built in Norman times (some late medieval additions and restoration work carried out in the 19th century): it is listed Grade I. Forrabury church also has some Norman work but the tower was added in 1750. The Rev R. S. Hawker wrote a poem on "The Bells of Forrabury": it was based on a local legend arising from the absence of a peal of bells in the tower. At Welltown in Forrabury parish is a manor house dating from about 1640 and at Worthyvale and Redevallen in Minster parish are two manor houses also of the 17th century. Not far from Worthyvale is an inscribed stone (Latini ic iacit filius Macari = Latin son of Macarus lies here). This stone is popularly known as King Arthur's Grave due to the erroneous identification of Slaughter Bridge with the site of Camlann. At Waterpit Down (on the road towards Launceston in Minster parish) are the remains of a cross probably from the 10th century. Camelford railway station (now occupied by the British Cycling Museum) was built in 1893 and was closed in 1966. (Though named after nearby Camelford it was in Minster parish.)

Montrose School

Montrose School is an independent college preparatory day school for girls grades 6–12. The mission of Montrose is to educate girls of faith, character and vision in a tradition of academic excellence. Montrose is now located in Medfield, Massachusetts.
History.
A group of parents and educators came together in 1979 with a shared vision of education to found Montrose School in Brookline, Massachusetts. They wanted to create a school that would integrate a traditional liberal arts curriculum, supportive teacher-student relationships, solid moral guidance offered in partnership with parents, and the study and practice of Roman Catholicism.
Education in the Catholic religion was very important to the founders. The vision of the school was inspired by the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and the vision of St. Josemaria Escriva. They asked the Prelature of Opus Dei to provide chaplains to oversee the religious teachings, celebrate Mass, hear confessions, and occasionally teach. Montrose now has two Catholic priests available to students of the Catholic and other religions.
After its initial period in Brookline, the school spent a few years each in the towns of Westwood and Natick. Montrose is now settled at its permanent location in Medfield, Massachusetts.
Extracurricular.
Sports.
Montrose offers six sports at its school. During fall, soccer, field hockey and cross-country ae offered. Basketball is offered during the winter season and lacrosse and softball during the spring. In 2009, Montrose was undefeated in lacrosse. Sarah Blahnik, class of 2006, currently plays lacrosse for Stanford University. Besides the five sanctioned sports, students are encouraged to start a club if they would like to see another sport on the Montrose campus.
In fall 2009, the varsity soccer team reached the finals in the IGC, losing to Waring. The only team the 2009 Mavericks lost to was Waring.
In the 2011-2012 school year, Montrose became Triple-Crown Champions by winning the IGC in varsity soccer, varsity basketball and varsity lacrosse.
Drama program.
The Montrose Players put on two major productions each year. The fall production is usually opened to high school students only and is primarily a classic drama. The spring production is a musical that is open to the entire school.

Vivian Potter

Vivian Harold Potter (23 October 1878 – 19 November 1968) was a New Zealand Member of Parliament, miner, trade unionist, and soldier.
Private life.
Potter was born in Hamilton in 1878, the son of Albert Potter. His mother was Catherine Potter (née Whitehouse), Albert Potter's second wife. Albert Potter left his first wife in 1862 in Hobart when he discovered that both she and Catherine Whitehouse were pregnant with his children; he secretly took four of their five children with them to Auckland. His first wife tracked him down in Mount Eden in 1892.
Vivian Potter mostly lived in Auckland during his early life. He fought in the Second Boer War with the 7th Contingent for about two years; he was a Squadron Quartermaster Sergeant with registration number 4045.
After the Boer War, he married Lillah Coleman at Waihi in January 1904. He was a miner at Waihi and was a member of the Waihi Miners' Union, but opposed the 1912 strike. After the strike was over, he travelled the North Island and lectured on labour arbitration and conciliation.
He was a Second Lieutenant in World War I. He was granted indefinite leave from military service in March 1918 because he suffered from sciatica.
Political career.
Potter served on the Waihi Borough Council. He chaired the Waihi school committee for some time, and was on the advisory committee for the Technical School.
Potter represented the Roskill electorate for the Reform Party in the House of Representatives of New Zealand from 1919 to 1928. In the , Potter stood in the electorate as an independent but was beaten by Arthur Stallworthy. In the 1931 election, he was one of five candidates in Eden and came last. In the , he stood in Roskill electorate again, and came fourth of the five candidates.
He died on 19 November 1968 and was buried at Mangere Lawn Cemetery.

TOSCO II process

The TOSCO II process is an above ground retorting technology for shale oil extraction, which uses fine particles of oil shale that are heated in a rotating kiln. The particularity of this process is that it use hot ceramic balls for the heat transfer between the retort and a heater. The process was tested in a 40 tonnes per hour test facility near Parachute, Colorado. 
History.
TOSCO II process is a refinement of the Swedish Aspeco process. The Tosco Corporation purchased its patent rights in 1952. In 1956, the Denver Research Institute performed research and development of this technology, including testing of a 24 ton per day pilot plant, which operated until 1966. Later the technology development was continued under Tosco's own directions. In 1964 Tosco, Standard Oil of Ohio, and Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company formed Colony Development, a joint venture company to develop the Colony Shale Oil Project and to commercialize the TOSCO II technology. The project was ended in April 1972.
Technology.
The TOSCO II process is classified as a hot recycled solids technology. It employs a horizontal rotating kiln-type retort. In this process, oil shale is crushed smaller than and enters the system through pneumatic lift pipes in which oil shale is elevated by hot gas streams and preheated to about . After entering into retort, oil shale is mixed with hot ceramic balls with temperature from to . This increase the oil shale temperature to between and , in which pyrolysis occurs. In the pyrolysis process, kerogen decomposes to oil shale gas and oil vapors, while the remainder of the oil shale forms spent shale. Vapors are transferred to a condensor (fractionator) for separation into various fractions. At the kiln passage, the spent shale and the ceramic balls are separated in a perforated rotating separation drum (trommel). The crushed spent shale falls through holes in the trommel, while ceramic balls are transferred to the ball heater. Combustible shale gas is burned in the ball heater to reheat the ceramic balls.
The overall thermal efficiency of TOSCO II process is low because the energy of spent shale is not recovered and much of the produced shale gas is consumed by the process itself. The efficiency could be increased by burning char (carbonaceous residue in the spent shale) instead of shale gas as a fuel of the ball heater. The process' other disadvantages are mechanical complexity and large number of moving parts. Also the lifetime of ceramic balls is limited. Disposal of spent shale includes environmental problems because it is very finely crushed and contains carbon residue.

Until They Sail

Until They Sail is a 1957 American black and white CinemaScope drama film directed by Robert Wise. The screenplay by Robert Anderson, based on a story by James A. Michener included in his 1951 anthology "Return to Paradise", focuses on four New Zealand sisters and their relationships with U.S. Marines during World War II. 
Plot.
The film opens in a Wellington courtroom, where testimony prompts Barbara Leslie (Jean Simmons) to flash back to the events that led to the trial. She and her sisters Anne (Joan Fontaine), Evelyn (Sandra Dee), and Delia (Piper Laurie) live in Christchurch, where most of the male residents, including their brother Kit and Barbara's new husband Mark, are preparing to leave for World War II duty. Delia announces her engagement to Phil Friskett (Wally Cassell), known as "Shiner", who is one of the city's few remaining bachelors, but word of Kit's death dampens the celebration. Repressed and judgmental spinster sister Anne disapproves of the upcoming nuptials, but Barbara defends Delia's decision.
Within weeks of the marriage, the sisters come to resent Shiner's abuse and are happy to see him leave for active duty. Delia moves to Wellington to work for the Navy. When several hundred United States Marines are shipped to Christchurch following the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the lonely local women are flattered by the attention they pay them. When Evelyn invites Capt. Richard Bates (Charles Drake) to dinner, he declines the offer, but not without attracting Anne's eye.
Concerned about Delia, Anne sends Barbara to Wellington, where she discovers her sister is registered at the St. George Hotel under her maiden name. Shiner is now a prisoner of war, and Delia has become involved with an American lieutenant named Andy. She plans to divorce Shiner and emigrate to the United States. Andy introduces Barbara to his friend Jack Harding (Paul Newman), a soldier investigating the prospective New Zealand brides of American soldiers. Although Barbara intends to remain faithful to her husband, she finds herself attracted to Jack.
Back in Christchurch, Anne is outraged by the lewd comments made by American servicemen in the lingerie shop where she works and writes a letter of complaint to the local paper. Following its publication, Richard is sent to the Leslie home to deliver a formal apology on behalf of the Marine Corps. Anne invites him to dinner, and Richard arrives with a gift of perfume for each sister. Anne accuses him of trying to seduce them.
Soon after, Barbara and Anne learn of Mark's death in North Africa and Richard's departure for active duty. He eventually returns to New Zealand to recuperate from an injury, and a romance between him and Anne blossoms. He proposes, but before the required marital investigation can take place, he is given offshore duty, leaving Anne expecting their child and unsure of what the future holds for them.
Jack arrives at the Leslie home to conduct his investigation of Anne, and he advises her that wartime romances stem from loneliness rather than love. Barbara tells him his assessment is heartless. Shortly after she discovers Richard's name on the latest casualty list in. Weeks later, Jack meets Barbara at a local dance, where she suggests he uses alcohol to avoid intimacy. He breaks down in her arms, and a strong friendship between the two blossoms.
Jack celebrates Christmas Eve with the Leslie family, which now includes Anne's newborn son. When he announces his imminent departure to, he and Barbara share an amorous embrace. Months later, Evelyn's sweetheart Tommy returns from war and proposes to her. Barbara sees an ad from Richard's mother in a newspaper column containing personal notices from American families and writes to her. Mrs. Bates sends money to finance Anne and her baby's move to Oklahoma to live with Richard's family.
As Anne's departure approaches, and the aftermath of the end of the war, Delia goes to Wellington to see her off, only to meet Shiner, who has just returned from war. He accuses her of infidelity and she demands a divorce so she can leave for America with her lover. Infuriated, Shiner kills his wife with a Japanese sword he brought back from the war.
Weeks later, during the murder trial, Jack is forced to reveal his investigation report detailing Delia's many affairs with American soldiers. Upset that her sister's infidelities seemingly have justified her savage murder, Barbara refuses Jack's invitation to leave New Zealand with him. Upon reflection, she packs her belongings and arrives at Jack's hotel to tell him she's ready to embark upon a new life with him.
Music.
The score for the film was composed and conducted by David Raksin. The title song included lyrics by Sammy Cahn and was performed under the main titles by vocalist Eydie Gorme.
The complete score was issued on CD in 2009, on "Film Score Monthly" records.
Production.
Robert Wise and Mark Robson had originally purchased the rights for Michener's story when they were at RKO. Casting problems forced them to delay the filming when the rights went to Hill-Hecht-Lancaster Productions who were going to cast Burt Lancaster. When the company made "The Kentuckian" instead, MGM acquired the rights, first intending their contract lead Glenn Ford playing the lead Marine. Robert Wise than reacquired the film through MGM in his last film of his contract with the studio.
Wise visited New Zealand to familiarise himself with the nation and the people, but filmed the movie on the MGM back lot.
He had originally intended to shoot the film in colour.
Stewart Granger was once announced for the lead.
Box Office.
According to MGM records the film earned $745,000 in the US and Canada and $675,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $1,055,000.
Critical reception.
Bosley Crowther of "The New York Times" observed, "The genuine tugs at the heart are few and far between in this bittersweet but basically restrained chronicle. Robert Anderson's adaptation . . . is honest and straightforward . . . Unfortunately there is a good deal of introspective soul-searching before this narrative arrives at its sad and happy endings." 
William K. Zinsser of the "New York Herald Tribune" said the film "has moments of genuine tenderness and truth."

<doc id="20467381" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20467381" title="Overchoice">
Overchoice

Overchoice, also referred to as "choice overload", is a term describing a problem facing consumers in the postindustrial society: too many choices. The term was first introduced by Alvin Toffler in his 1970 book, "Future Shock".
Overchoice is the result of technological progress. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, each year, more and more products are being offered. Consumers have more disposable income to spend, and producers can more easily and cheaply introduce product variations.
Having more choices, on the surface, appears to be a positive development; however it hides an underlying problem: faced with too many choices, consumers have trouble making optimal choices, and thus as a result can be indecisive, unhappy, and even refrain from making the choice (purchase) at all. Alvin Toffler noted that as the choice turns to overchoice, "freedom of more choices" ironically becomes the opposite—the "unfreedom". Often, a customer makes a decision without sufficiently researching his choices, which may often require days. When confronted with a plethora of choices without perfect information, many people prefer to make no choice at all, even if making a choice would lead to a better outcome.
Existence of overchoice, both perceived and real, was confirmed by studies as early as the mid-1970s. Numbers of various brands, from soaps to cars, have been steadily rising for over half a century. In just one example—different brands of soap and detergents—the numbers of choices offered by an average US supermarket went from 65 in 1950, through 200 in 1963, to over 360 in 2004. The more choices one has, the slower one is to make decisions.
Opposites of overchoice (sometimes referred to as underchoice) include standardization.

Defensor minor

The Defensor minor is a work by Marsilius of Padua written around 1342. The Defensor minor is a restatement and defense of Marsilius's best known work, the "Defensor pacis". 
The text discusses civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the confession, penance, indulgences, the Crusades, pilgrimages, plenitudo potestatis, legislative power, the origin of the sovereignty, wedding, and divorce.
Civil jurisdiction.
With regard to jurisdiction, Marsilius distinguishes between divine and human laws, the first event which is independent of any human will and on the conduct of man in view of the afterlife, the second which determines the will of the people, endowed with coercive power and not modifiable by any clergyman.
This applies also to the Pope that even with his decrees may waive the law, manifestation of the people's sovereignty. While the beneficiaries of the two laws are identical, its object and purpose are different. The one seeks the good of the soul and the other cares for earthly well-being, with the result that the church is denied the power to make laws, even in the persistent silence of human legislation. The same applies to amendments and changes, which should remain solely with the people. The only thing that is relevant to the clergy is the non-legal rules that affect morality and resolve themselves into simple counsels and take effect with counsellors.
The clergy.
The task and the main function of the clergy is to teach the sacred texts and preparing souls for the afterlife. The Church has repeatedly stated that for the sinner there is no other system of redemption from sin but confession. Marsilius, in an effort to bring man to God, regardless of any broker, says that confession should be done directly to God and that salvation comes only by true repentance. This anticipates what will be one of the tenets of Protestantism. The necessity of this Sacrament, that is only recommended and not required, is not detected from the Holy Scriptures. Only sincere repentance to the outside of any denominational gives you that peace in the soul that is the prelude of eternal salvation. Absolution from sin belongs only to God and the priest, who may do so, does so only within the Church. "Sufficit soli Deo confiteri peccata ipsa, videlicet recognoscendo, et de ipsis poenitendo cum proposito talia alterius non committendi." 
These words can be regarded as harbingers of what will be the principles of the Lutheran Reformation.
"Sufficit sola contritio et vera poenitentia de commisso absque omni confessione facta vel fienda sacerdoti, ut immediate absolvatur per Deum." Marsilio does not exclude absolutely confession: he says only that it is useful but not essential, which it would be if it were a precept, therefore he also denies the priestly power to inflict penalties.
Only contrition frees from sin not repentance of any material or spiritual character almost like a compensation for the sin."Quamvis in hoc saeculo nullam realem aut personalem satisfactionem exhibeat pro peccatis."

<doc id="20467412" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20467412" title="Irving P. Krick">
Irving P. Krick

Dr. Irving P. Krick (1906 - June 20, 1996) was an American meteorologist and inventor, the founding professor of Department of Meteorology at California Institute of Technology (1933–1948), one of the U.S. Air Force meteorologists who provided forecasts for the Normandy Landings in 1944, a controversial pioneer of long-term forecasting and cloud seeding, and "a brilliant American salesman" who in 1938 started the first private weather business in the United States.
Early years.
Krick was born in San Francisco in 1906. He attended college the University of California at Berkeley, achieving a bachelor's degree in physics. However, his first career aspiration was music. Krick was an accomplished pianist and pursued music professionally but found it financially unrewarding. Still in early twenties he worked at the radio station and at a stock brokerage – until the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Finally, working for an airline and advice from his brother-in-law, Horace Byers, an MIT graduate, helped him find his true interest in weather. 
Caltech.
Around 1930, he began studying at the California Institute of Technology in the Department of Aeronautics, which provided only a few courses in meteorology, notably by Beno Gutenberg (atmospheric structure) and Theodore von Kármán (aeronautics), Krick's advisors in his doctoral studies. Caltech offered the first dedicated meteorology class in the 1933–1934 season. Krick made his name known by a controversial paper asserting that the 1933 crash of USS Akron was a direct consequence of a mistaken forecast by the Weather Bureau. Krick's paper was instrumental to von Kármán's work explaining the actual cause of Akron disaster; he was also instrumental in determining the cause of the USS Macon crash in 1935. These publications brought Krick to the attention of the US Air Force; Krick befriended Air Force chief Hap Arnold, then a colonel stationed at March Field not far from CalTech. 
Krick completed his doctoral degree in 1934 and remained at Caltech as an instructor. In 1937 he helped found the school's meteorology department and became its head. The department was unique in its commercial focus on the needs of profitable industries, including not just aviation, but almost anyone willing to pay, including the movie industry, for which Krick famously forecast the weather for the burning of Atlanta in "Gone With The Wind". Krick was determined about making money; "weather forecasting was his product line, although, like many a great salesmen, his number one product was himself". He then stayed as a professor, offering a special curriculum for Arnold's nascent Air Force Weather Service. 
Caltech terminated the meteorology department in 1948. In response, Krick left the school to start his own firm, taking with him most of the department staff.
World War II.
With the outbreak of World War II Arnold recruited Krick into the Air Force. Krick prevailed over other, scientifically inclined meteorologists: while they searched for causes of natural phenomena, Krick relied on analyzing historic patterns and cycles. He reused old weather maps that resembled current situation, arguing that future weather developments will most likely follow the recorded patterns - the same "weather typing" that brought him commissions from Hollywood studios. Critics called Krick's methods "canned memory". The primitive methods and aggressive salesmanship made Krick an enemy of scientific elite like George Cressman and Carl-Gustaf Rossby and Weather Bureau chief Francis W. Reichelderfer, who detested Krick as a "smug, supremely self-confident self-promoter". However, with Arnold's backing Krick was nearly invincible.
In 1944 Krick was engaged in meteorology support for the upcoming Allied Normandy Landings, along with rival weather services from the United Kingdom and U.S. Navy. On May 28 Sverre Petterssen, a Norwegian meteorologist in British service, raised concerns that a coming storm would break out on June 2 and interfere with the landings planned on June 5. Krick argued to the contrary, asserting that there is no need to postpone the offensive – he saw nothing but continuously quiet weather over the next five days. Krick based his confidence on studies of 50 years of recorded weather; he was certain that the English Channel is protected by the Azores High, a pressure pattern dominating over the Eastern Atlantic. Unusually to normal practice, as time passed by, the uncertainties of weather forecasting did not dissolve, and, as the countdown continued, tension between Krick and Petterssen increased further. June 3, Colonel Donald Yates (deputy to chief meteorologist James Martin Stagg), former student of Krick and one of the few people who could handle him, finally intervened into the rivalry and forced the Allied meteorologists to produce a joint, unified weather forecast. In the end, Petterssen's opinion prevailed and was proved in real life; despite Krick's initial objection, the landings were delayed by one day, saving the troops from an imminent disaster.
Post-war practice.
After leaving Caltech, Krick continued offering commercial long-term weather forecasts. He also added the service of cloud seeding, forcing precipitation in drought-affected areas. 
In summer of 1948 Krick performed the first series of 27 airborne cloud seeding tests over central Arizona, dropping up to of ice particles on each flight. Indeed, the seeded clouds released rain, raising water levels in local reservoirs. The "rain makers" admitted that the result had other, natural, causes, but in a year that was one of the driest on record it was a significant success. Financially, the volume of water added by Krick's experiment cost only $2.50, compared to $14 going rate. In December 1949 Krick suggested cloud seeding without resorting to airborne devices; his proposal employed ground-based smoke generators dispersing vaporized silver iodide. A single smoke dispenser set, asserted Krick, could be moved by two wheelbarrows; it theoretically provided cloud-seeding particles for an area of . Tests demonstrated a fourfold increase in precipitation. By 1951 his cloud-seeding business had 120 employees and had been hired to seed clouds over in the western United States as well as parts of Mexico and San Salvador.
However, the American meteorological establishment opposed his practice, asserting his methods of cloud seeding were bogus and the weather could not be forecast for more than five days in the future. Krick decided to offer his long term forecasting to the Weather Bureau, but they too did not believe in his methods, so he started a private business. He successfully proved his basic premises, making a substantial profit from forecasts and weather making. Krick's practice caught the eye of many famous figures, and he was hired to forecast the weather for presidential inaugurations and movie shoots. He garnered attention in 1957 when his prediction of sunny weather for President Eisenhower's second inauguration, made 17 days before the event, came true. Of his most notable achievements, Dr. Krick also made rain in Israel after a severe drought, made it stop hailing in Alberta, Canada, and made enough snow for the 1960 Winter Olympics to take place. 
During the mid-sixties, Irving P. Krick & Associates operated a successful cloud seeding operation in the area around Calgary, Alberta. This utilized both aircraft and ground-based generators that pumped silver iodide into the atmosphere in an attempt to reduce the threat of hail damage. Ralph Langeman, Lynn Garrison, and Stan McLeod, all ex-members of the RCAF, attending the University of Alberta, spent their summers flying hail suppression. A number of surplus Harvard aircraft were fitted with racks under each wing containing 32 railroad fuzees that were impregnated with silver iodide. These could be ignited individually or all at once, depending upon the threat. In coordination with ground units, the aircraft would lay a plume of silver iodide in front of approaching cumulo-nimbus clouds with noticeable effect. Large, active CBs were reduced to nothing. Heavy hail storms were reduced in intensity.
This effective program was funded by farmer contributions and government grants. The program was run each summer and did much to reduce crop damage by hail, otherwise the farm community would not have continued to finance the project.
In 1990 Krick sold his weather business to Strategic Weather Services, remaining with that company as chairman emeritus until his 1996 death from heart failure.

Lebensphilosophie

Lebensphilosophie ("philosophy of life") is a philosophical school of thought which emphasises the meaning, value and purpose of life as the foremost focus of philosophy. Inspired by the critique of rationalism in the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, Søren Kierkegaard, and Friedrich Nietzsche, it emerged in 19th-century Germany as a reaction to the rise of positivism and the theoretical focus prominent in much of post-Kantian philosophy.
It bore relation to the subjectivist philosophy of vitalism developed by Henri Bergson, which lent importance to immediacy of experience.
Twentieth-century forms of "Lebensphilosophie" can be identified with a critical stress on norms and conventions. The Israeli-American historian Nitzan Lebovic identified "Lebensphilosophie" with the tight relation between a "corpus of life- concepts" and what the German education system came to see, during the 1920s, as the proper "Lebenskunde", the ‘teaching of life’ or ‘science of life’—a name that seemed to support the broader philosophical outlook long since held by most biologists of the time. In his book Lebovic traces the transformation of the post-Nietzschean "Lebensphilosophie" from the radical aesthetics of the Stefan George Circle to Nazi or "biopolitical" rhetoric and politics. 
This philosophy pays special attention to "life" as a whole, which can only be understood from within. The movement can be regarded as a rejection of Kantian abstract philosophy or scientific reductionism of positivism.

Leverich Park

Leverich Park is a park located in Vancouver, Washington. It is located along Burnt Bridge Creek in a natural area of Vancouver adjacent to Interstate 5. The park features a large picnic shelter, picnic tables, plenty of hiking trails and a twelve hole Disc golf course.
History.
The park is north of 39th St., E. of Pacific Highway, and the state of Washington's oldest Blue Star Memorial Highway marker and L-shaped area of about 33 ½ acres, lying partly within and just north of the city limits, was deeded to the city for park purposes by Mrs. Anna Leverich. It was established as a municipal park in 1931 and in the same year an obelisk was erected and a Douglas fir planted by the bicentennial celebration of George Washington’s birth. In accordance with the terms of the deed, the natural beauty of the area has been preserved as much as possible. Burnt Bridge Creek, branching out among low hills and small groves of native firs, deciduous trees, and occasional cedars, gives the park a truly sylvan charm. The construction of Interstate 5 through Vancouver split the park separating the Covington House historic cabin and Kiggins Bowl from the rest of the park.
Disc Golf.
In 2008 a twelve hole disc golf course was added to the park. The course was the result of a cooperative effort between Vancouver-Clark Parks and Recreation, Vancouver-Clark Disc Golf and Stumptown Disc Golf.

559th Flying Training Squadron

The 559th Flying Training Squadron (559 FTS) is part of the 12th Flying Training Wing based at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. It operates the T-6 Texan II conducting flying training.
History.
The 559th was initially constituted as the 81st Bombardment Squadron, Light on 20 November 1940, assigned to the 12th Bombardment Group, Light. The squadron was activated at McChord Field, Washington. The squadron's original manning came from the 34th Bombardment Squadron consisting of 27 enlisted men and 1 officer, Major John J. O'Hara, who assumed command. Over the ensuing six months the squadron's ranks swelled to 190 enlisted men and 15 officers.
The 81st used one B-18 Bolo, one B-23 Dragon, and two PT-17 Kaydets, to conduct flight training while some of its rated personnel attended various Air Corps technical schools or on detached service with the Ferrying Command. The squadron was equipped with B-25 Mitchell in January 1942 and redesignated a medium bombardment squadron. Shortly thereafter the 12th Bombardment Group was transferred to Esler Field, Camp Beauregard, Louisiana. Soon after arriving the squadron initiated a training program which included all phases of combat flying, bombing, and gunnery. Bombing practice was conducted on the range in the Kisatchie National Forest, while gunnery training was accomplished in Army Air Forces schools at Panama City, Florida, and Las Vegas, Nevada. The squadron also participated in general field operations training near DeRidder, Louisiana. In late the 81st served as part of a detachment force of 40 aircraft and 450 officers and men that was sent to Stockton, California, for over-water training.
In June 1942 the squadron began its movement overseas. The air echelon staged at Morrison Field, Florida. On 14 July it flew to Accra, British West Africa then on to Khartoum in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and Cairo, Egypt. By mid-August the air echelon was in place at Deversoir, Egypt. The ground echelon had left Esler Field by train on 3 July for Fort Dix, New Jersey, where it boarded the SS Louis Pasteur and sailed from New York on 16 July, arriving at Freetown, Sierra Leone, eight days later. The personnel then sailed around the Cape of Good Hope, via Durban, South Africa, and arrived at Port Tewfik, Egypt, on 16 August. Two days later the ground echelon arrived at Deversoir.
Unpon its arrival the 81st underwent a training period with light bomber wings of the Royal Air Force and the South African Air Force. This training included five missions intended to acquaint the American aircrews with aids to navigation in the Middle East. The first mission was flown on the night of 16 August 1942 and consisted of a bombing attack on the harbor at Mersa Matruh. The raid was followed by attacks on Axis airdromes at Doba and Fuka, and on docks at Tobruk, Libya.
In September the 81st Bombardment Squadron went into action with the RAF's Desert Air Force in support of the British Eighth Army. One of the unit's earliest missions was a night raid on Sidi Haneish, in which it lost three bombers. During the weeks which followed the squadron struck Axis landing grounds, transportation facilities, and troop concentrations. After the Battle of El Alamein the squadron conducted a brief training program consisting principally of aerial gunnery, navigational flights, and night landings. The squadron resumed combat operations in December after rebasing further west. It participated in the pursuit of Field Marshal Rommel's Afrika Korps to Tripoli, which fell late in January 1943.
In February 1943 the 81st was sent to Algeria, where it joined elements of the Twelfth Air Force in support of Allied ground forces pushing eastward. After the German forces had been defeated in Africa the squadron was stationed at Hergla, Tunisia, and began participation in the Pantellerian campaign by pattern bombing coastal batteries on the island of Pantelleria. Following the capitulation of Axis forces in Pantelleria, on 11 June, the squadron conducted an intensive, three-week, program for training replacement crews recently arrived from the Zone of the Interior. The squadron also received replacement aircraft bringing the total from 13 to 24.
Through July the squadron conducted bombing operations against Axis aerodromes, harbor installations, and towns on the island of Sicily. Early in August it transferred to Ponte Olivo Airdrome, Sicily, whence it continued to operate against Sicilian targets until the island was completely cleared of Axis forces. On 23 August the squadron moved to Gerbini Main Airdrome, Sicily, preliminary to entering the Italian Campaign. From September to early-November 1943, the 81st flew numerous missions in support of the American Fifth Army and the British Eighth Army then in the early stages of the Invasion of Italy. The types of targets most frequently attacked were rail junctions and marshalling yards, airdromes, landing grounds, highway bridges, gun emplacements, and troop concentrations. After rebasing to Foggia Main, Italy, on 10 November the squadron increased the range of its bombing missions to include Yugoslavia. Prior to the end of January 1944 it participated in 10 raids on harbor and dock facilities along the Yugoslavian Adriatic Coast, at Zadar, Split, and Šibenik. In addition, the squadron flew a mission against the Mostar Main Airdrome in Yugoslavia and another directed at the Eleusis Airdrome in Greece. The 81st Bombardment Squadron's final Italian Campaign mission took place on 30 January 1944 in an intended attack upon a road junction near Rome. A cloud covering completely obscured the target as the bombers approached, however, so they aborted the mission.
The squadron was transferred to the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations and consequently spent seven weeks relocating. On 9 February the entire unit sailed from Taranto, Italy, aboard the English vessel Diwara, for Port Said, Egypt then by train to Cairo, and then sailed, again aboard the Dilwara, from Port Tewfik for Bombay, India. From Bombay it moved by train and a Ganges River boat to Tezgaon Airdrome near Calcutta. Equipped with new bombers, it initiated a training program in low-level attack and bombing methods which were being used extensively in that area at the time.
The 81st entered combat on 16 April 1944 when it dispatched 12 B-25s in an attack upon railway sidings and a Japanese supply dump at Mogaung, Burma. One bomber was lost in the raid. Eight days later the 81st attacked Japanese stores and troop concentrations in the Kazu area. In May the it made numerous attacks upon the Tiddim Road in Burma, as well as on railway lines running north and east of Mandalay. Probably the unit's most significant mission during the month was its participation in the bombing of Ningthoukhong, Burma, a key position to the Japanese defensive line. The town was reported to have housed Japanese artillery pieces, antitank guns, tanks, and as many as 1,000 troops.
During the ensuing 12 months the 81st helped to gain air superiority over the Japanese in Burma and provided support for Allied ground forces in driving them completely out of that country. The squadron's efforts were expended principally in bombing attacks on airdromes and airfields, headquarters buildings, roads, highway bridges, gun emplacements, railway bridges, rail junctions, marshalling yards, storage areas, and troop concentrations. Notable was the series of missions which contributed to the capture of Myritkyina by General Joseph W. Stilwell's ground forces early in August. The unit also participated in tactical operations during February and March 1945 helping to capture Miektila and Mandalay in May.
In September 1944 the unit extended its range of operations to include targets in China. At that time the Japanese were attempting to throw the Chinese back across the Salween River. The 81st provided effective support to the Chinese troops engaged in repelling the Japanese offensive. For its part the squadron participated in a series of eight bombing missions targeting Japanese stores and troop concentrations, principally in the Chinese cities of Bhamo, Mangshih, and Wanling.
With the capture of Burma in the spring of 1945, combat operations for the 81st Bombardment Squadron were greatly reduced. At its base in India the unit began transition training in A-26 Invader aircraft. Training ceased with the surrender of Japan in August 1945. The air echelon of the squadron left India on 27 September on the first leg of its journey back to the Zone of the Interior. Departure of the ground echelon was delayed, however, was delayed for three months, sailing on Christmas Eve 1945 it Karachi, India, aboard the Hawaiian Shipper, for Seattle, Washington. There was a brief stop in Singapore, after which the voyage was continued out through the South China Sea and into the Pacific. On 21 January the squadron was reduced in strength to one officer and two enlisted men and then inactivated at Fort Lawton, Washington.
Fifteen months later, on 19 May 1947, it was activated at Langley Field, Virginia as a light bombardment squadron. Without ever having been manned, however, the squadron was inactivated on 10 September 1948.
The squadron was redesignated the 559th Fighter-Escort Squadron, and assigned to Strategic Air Command on 27 October 1950. On 1 November it was activated at Turner Air Force Base, Georgia assigned to the 12th Fighter-Escort Group. Early in December 1950 it transferred to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas. The primary mission of the 559th was to organize and train a force capable of providing immediate fighter escort and air base protection in any part of the world. In January 1951 the squadron began flying training in the F-84 Thunderjet. The program principally of routine transition training, night flying, instrument flights, and ground controlled approaches. Bombing and gunnery practice was accomplished at the Matagorda Island Bombing and Gunnery Range on Matagorda Island, just off the Texas coast. Late in April the squadron participated in a practice mission to Turner Air Force Base. Early in June the 559th participated in a long-range escort mission conducted by the 12th Fighter-Escort Wing. All told, 75 F-84s were involved. After staging at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, they were divided into two sections. One section escorted a large number of B-36 Peacemakers in a simulated bombing mission over New York City. The other section escorted another group of B-36s in a similar mission over Detroit. All the Thunderjets staged at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan, before returning to Bergstrom.
In mid-July 1951 the 559th went on temporary duty to RAF Manston, England. The move was made by the Military Air Transport Service and by civilian aircraft. Having left its own fighter aircraft at Bergstrom, the wing used F-84s of the 31st Fighter-Escort Wing which it replaced at Manston. Operations overseas began during the latter part of July with orientation flights to various United States Air Force bases in England. During August all units of the 12th Wing took part in a 7th Air Division operation which was designed to measure the defense of Norway. While in England the 559th Fighter-Escort Squadron and its two companion units, the 560th and 561st Squadrons, went to Wheelus Field, Libya, for two weeks of gunnery practice. Late in November 1951 the wing began moving back to the United States. The advanced and rear echelons were airlifted all the way from Manston to Austin by MATS aircraft. The second increment sailed aboard the USS General W. G. Haan to Newark, New Jersey, and made its way to the wing's home base via MATS aircraft. Back at Bergstrom the squadron was equipped with new F-84s.
In January 1953 the 559th was redesignated as a strategic fighter squadron. In May it deployed to Chitose Air Base, Japan for approximately 90 days. The principal purpose of the deployment was to provide training for the wing and enable it, while operating as a part of the Northern Area Air Defense Command, to augment the Japanese Air Defense Force. On 15 May replaced the 508th Strategic Fighter Wing on rotation in Japan. On 12 June the commanding officer of the 559th Squadron, Lieutenant Colonel Paul M. Hall, was killed in an airplane crash while making a ground-controlled approach. The squadron redeployed to Bergstrom Air Force Base in August.
Over a period of several months after returning to its home base in August 1953, the 559th Strategic Fighter Squadron made special efforts to qualify all of its aircrews as combat ready. At the same time it was interested in requalifying combat ready crews in various phases of bombing and gunnery techniques. For these purposes extensive use was made of the bombing and gunnery range facilities on Matagorda Island. In May 1954, however, the 559th again deployed to Japan on temporary duty to Misawa Air Base. One of the most important operations during this second tour of duty in the Far East was a series of exercises in which the capabilities of the Northern Air Defense Area were tested. The wing returned to the United States again in August 1954.
While stationed at Bergstrom Air Force Base during the next several years the 559th continued to accomplish the usual training programs and routine training missions. There were, however, a number of special missions and other activities. In June 1955 the unit participated in weapons loading exercise and unit simulated combat mission at Gray Air Force Base, Texas. Operating from the forward staging base (Gray AFB), F-84s of the 559th were scheduled to destroy a number of targets simulated on Matagorda Island. On this mission the Thunderjets accomplished air refueling over Roswell, New Mexico. Meanwhile in May 1955 the 12th Strategic Fighter Wing was selected to represent the Strategic Air Command in the annual fighter competition to be held in connection with the USAF Gunnery Meet in September 1955 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. A group of candidates began training on Matagorda Island in June. Selected for the competition were two officers from the 12th Wing headquarters, and one each from the 559th, 560th, and 561st Squadrons. Competing at Nellis in September against this special team from the Strategic Air Command were other teams from the Air Defense Command, Far East Air Forces, Tactical Air Command, and United States Air Forces in Europe. At the meet the Strategic Air Command took third place, running behind those of the Far East Air Forces and the United States Air Forces in Europe. Additionally, during the early part of May 1956 the 559th began participation with the 560th in the deployment of 25 F-84s for approximately 90 days at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska. The purpose of the operation was to furnish a competent fighter offensive within the Alaskan Air Command. In addition to carrying out routine aircrew training, while at Eielson the detachment took part in several Fifteenth Air Force emergency war plan missions. At the conclusion of the temporary duty in Alaska the detachment flew nonstop back to its home base. The 27th Air refueling Squadron provided in-flight refueling for the redeployment.
Plans announced at Bergstrom as early as April 1956 indicated that in due course of time the 559th would convert to the long-range F-101 Voodoo. A tentative schedule for equipping with the F-101 was set for May through October 1957. Training in the new aircraft for aircrews and maintenance personnel of the wing began at Bergstrom in November 1956. This training was discontinued after about a month, however, following a decision by higher headquarters not to equip the wing with the F-101 aircraft.
Effective 1 July 1957, the 559th was redesignated a fighter-day squadron and assigned to the Tactical Air Command. The wing and its squadrons were inactivated, however, on 8 January 1958. On 17 April 1962 the 559th Fighter-Day Squadron was redesignated the 559th Tactical Fighter Squadron. At the same time it was activated and assigned to the Tactical Air Command. Effective 25 April 1962, the squadron was organized at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, with further assignment to the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing. The squadron augmented air defenses of Okinawa from, June–September 1965 and participated in combat operations over Southeast Asia from, 2 January 1966 – 23 March 1970. It has trained US and friendly nation instructor aircrews since May 1972.

Lunatia lewisii

Neverita lewisii (previously known as Polinices lewisii, Lunatia lewisii, Euspira lewisii), common name Lewis's moon snail, is a species of large operculated sea snail. It is a predatory marine gastropod in the family Naticidae, the moon snails. Traditionally, this species was assigned to either the genus "Lunatia", the genus "Polinices" or the genus "Euspira". Recently, it was assigned to the genus "Neverita" based on molecular data. 
This is the largest species in the family.
Distribution.
"Neverita lewisii" lives in the Eastern Pacific, from British Columbia to northern Baja California, Mexico.
Habitat.
This snail is found intertidally and at depths of up to , usually ploughing through the substrate looking for prey.
Description.
The shell of this species can grow to across, the largest of the moon snails. It has an extremely large foot, which when the snail is active, is extended up over the shell and mantle cavity. Part of the propodium contains a black-tipped siphon which leads water into the mantle cavity. The cephalic tentacles, located on its head, are usually visible above the propodium.
When the animal retracts its soft parts into the shell, a lot of water is expelled, thus it is possible to close the shell with its tight-fitting operculum.
Diet.
"Neverita lewisii" feeds mainly on bivalve molluscs by drilling a hole in the shell with its radula and feeding on the organism's soft flesh.
Reproduction.
Like other moon snails, this species lays its eggs in a "sand collar". The eggs may number in the thousands and hatch into microscopic larvae which feed on plankton until they undergo torsion and metamorphose the adult stage.

Marcello Giordani

Marcello Giordani (birth name Marcello Guagliardo; born 25 January 1963) is an Italian operatic tenor who has sung leading roles in opera houses throughout Europe and the United States. He has had a distinguished association with the New York Metropolitan Opera, where he has sung in over 170 performances since his debut there in 1993. (He is not to be confused with another Italian tenor, Massimo Giordano, who toured with Anna Netrebko in 2009.)
Biography.
Marcello Giordani was born in 1963 in the small Sicilian town of Augusta. His father, a former prison guard, was the owner of a major gasoline station in the town, and his mother was a housewife. He showed a talent for singing at an early age and took private lessons in Augusta as well as singing in his church choir. When he was nineteen, he quit his job in a bank and moved to Milan where he studied voice with Nino Carta. Giordani made his professional operatic debut in 1986 as the Duke in "Rigoletto" at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto. His debut at La Scala came two years later when he sang Rodolfo in "La bohème". He went on to sing throughout Italy and Europe, and in 1988, he made his American debut singing Nadir in "Les pêcheurs de perles" with Portland Opera, a company with which he frequently appeared early in his career. Engagements with several other American opera companies followed, including San Francisco Opera, Seattle Opera, Los Angeles Opera and the Opera Company of Philadelphia. Giordani made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1993 as Nemorino in a Parks performance of "L'elisir d'amore" opposite Maria Spacagna as Adina. His first performance on the actual stage at the Metropolitan Opera House was on December 11, 1995 as Rodolfo to Hei-Kyung Hong's Mimì with Carlo Rizzi conducting.
In 1994, vocal problems which had begun to surface in the previous years became more acute. He began to retrain his voice with Bill Schuman in New York but did not cancel his engagements. In 1995 he sang Alfredo in "La traviata" at Covent Garden under Sir Georg Solti, whose guidance he credits as a great help in the rebuilding of his career. In 1997, Giordani again sang at Covent Garden under Solti (as Gabriele Adorno in "Simon Boccanegra"), in what turned out to be the final opera performances that Solti would ever conduct. His career at the Met, which had initially been sporadic, began to flourish. By the end of 2008 he had sung over 170 performances with the company, including the leading tenor roles in the Metropolitan Opera premieres of "Benvenuto Cellini" and "Il pirata". He also sang in the Met's season opening performances in both 2006 (Pinkerton in "Madama Butterfly") and 2007 (Edgardo in "Lucia di Lammermoor"), and on 18 September 2008, he was the tenor soloist in the Met's performance of Verdi's "Requiem" in memory of Luciano Pavarotti.
Amongst the other opera houses and festivals where Giordani has performed during his career are the Opernhaus Zürich, Vienna State Opera, Opéra National de Paris, Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, Deutsche Oper Berlin, Houston Grand Opera, Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, Teatro Regio di Parma, Teatro Regio di Torino, Teatro Massimo Bellini di Catania, Arena di Verona, the Verbier Festival, and the Festival Puccini in Torre del Lago. In August 2008, Giordani appeared in concert with Salvatore Licitra and Ramón Vargas in Beijing's Great Hall of the People during the first week of the 2008 Olympic Games. 2008 also saw his appointment as Artistic Director for Musical Events at "Città della Notte", a new arts center near Augusta. In December 2008 he will gave his first master classes there.
In 2010, Marcello Giordani created the Marcello Giordani Foundation to help young opera singers at the beginning of their career. The first annual Marcello Giordani Vocal Competition will be held in Sicily in 2011. 
Giordani met his wife, Wilma, when he was singing in Lucerne in 1988. They married two years later. The couple and their two sons live in New York and Sicily.

USS Valcour (AVP-55)

USS "Valcour" (AVP-55), later AGF-1, was a United States Navy ship in commission as a seaplane tender from 1946 to 1965 and as a flagship from 1965 to 1973.
Construction and commissioning.
"Valcour" was laid down on 21 December 1942 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard and launched on 5 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. H. C. Davis, the wife of Captain H. C. Davis, the intelligence officer for the 13th Naval District. "Valcour" was taken to the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton, Washington, for completion, but the heavy load of repairs conducted by that shipyard on ships damaged in combat during World War II meant that her construction assumed a lower priority than the repair of combatant vessels. She finally was commissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (the former Puget Sound Navy Yard) on 5 July 1946 with Commander Barnet T. Talbott in command. She was the last of the 35 "Barnegat"-class ships to commission.
United States East Coast and Caribbean Service 1946–1949.
"Valcour" conducted her shakedown off San Diego, California, between 9 August 1946 and 9 September 1946. Ordered to the United States Atlantic Fleet upon its completion, she transited the Panama Canal between 17 September 1946 and 21 September 1946 and reached the New York Naval Shipyard at Brooklyn, New York, on 26 September 1946 for post-shakedown shipyard availability. "Valcour" subsequently operated out of Norfolk, Virginia; Quonset Point, Rhode Island; Cristóbal, Panama Canal Zone; and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, tending seaplanes of the Fleet Air Wings, Atlantic, through mid-1949.
Middle East service 1949–1951.
Having received orders designating her as flagship for the Commander, Middle Eastern Force (ComMidEastFor), "Valcour" departed Norfolk on 29 August 1949, steamed across the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean, stopping at Gilbraltar and at Golfe Juan, France, transited the Suez Canal, and arrived at Aden, a British protectorate, on 24 September 1949. Over the months that ensued, "Valcour" touched at ports on the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, including Bahrain; Kuwait; Ras Al Mishab, Basra; Ras Tanura, Muscat; Bombay, India; Colombo, Ceylon; and Karachi, Pakistan. She returned to Norfolk on 6 March 1950, via Aden; Suez; Piraeus, Greece; Sfax, Tunisia; and Gibraltar. 
Late in the summer of 1950, after a period of leave, upkeep, and training, she returned to the Middle East for her second tour as ComMidEastFor flagship, which lasted from 5 September 1950 to 15 March 1951.
Collision with SS "Thomas Tracy" 14 May 1951.
On the morning of 14 May 1951, two months after she returned to Norfolk from her second Middle East tour, "Valcour" headed out to sea for independent ship exercises. While passing the collier off Cape Henry, Virginia, she suffered a steering casualty and power failure. As she veered sharply across the path of the oncoming collier, "Valcour" sounded warning signals. "Thomas Tracy" attempted to make an emergency turn to starboard but her bow soon plowed into "Valcour"s starboard side, rupturing an aviation gasoline fuel tank. An intense fire soon broke out aboard "Valcour" and, fed by the high-test aviation gasoline, spread rapidly. To make matters worse, water began flooding into "Valcour"s ruptured hull. Although fire and rescue parties on board "valcour" went to work immediately, the gasoline-fed inferno forced many of "Valcour"s crew to leap overboard into the swirling currents of Hampton Roads to escape the flames that soon enveloped "Valcour"s starboard side. The situation at that point looked so severe that "Valcour"s commanding officer, Captain Eugene Tatom, gave the order to abandon ship.
"Thomas Tracy", meanwhile, fared better. Fires aboard "Thomas Tracy" were confined largely to the forward hold and her crew suffered no injuries. She managed to return to Newport News, Virginia, with her cargo, 10,000 tons of coal, intact. "Valcour", on the other hand, became the object of exhaustive salvage operations. Rescue ships, including the submarine rescue ship and the United States Coast Guard tug USCGC "Cherokee" (WAT-165) sped to the scene of the tragedy. Fire and rescue parties, in some cases forced to use gas masks, succeeded in bringing the blaze under control but not before 11 men had died and 16 more had been injured. Another 25 were listed as "missing", and later were confirmed as dead.
Reconstruction 1951.
Towed back to Norfolk, which she reached at 02:00 hours on 15 May 1951, "Valcour" underwent an extensive overhaul over the ensuing months. During those repairs, improvements were made in shipboard habitability—air conditioning was installed—and the removal of her single 5-inch (127 mm) 38-caliber forward gun mount to compensate for the increased weight of her other alterations gave the ship a silhouette unique for "Barnegat"-class ships. The reconstruction task was finally completed on 4 December 1951.
Middle East service 1952–1965.
"Valcour" rotated yearly between the United States and the Middle East from 1952 to 1965, conducting yearly deployments as one of the trio of "Barnegat"-class ships—along with and —that served alternately as flagship for ComMidEastFor. Through 1961, she followed a highly predictable schedule, departing Norfolk each January, relieving "Duxbury Bay" upon arrival on station, being relieved by "Greenwich Bay" at the end of her tour, and returning to Norfolk.
There were several highlights to "Valcour"s lengthy Middle East deployments. In July 1953, during her fourth Middle East cruise, "Valcour" aided a damaged cargo ship in the Indian Ocean and then escorted her through a violent typhoon to Bombay, India. In May 1955, men from "Valcour" boarded the blazing and abandoned Italian tanker "Argea Prima" at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, even though "Argea Prima" at the time was laden with a cargo of of crude oil, and proceeded to control the fires. Once "Valcour"s fire and rescue party had performed their salvage operation, "Argea Prima"s crew reboarded the ship and she continued her voyage. Later, "Valcour" received a plaque from the owners of "Argea Prima" in appreciation of the assistance rendered to their ship.
Valcour performed her duties so efficiently that the Chief of Naval Operations congratulated ComMidEastFor for her outstanding contribution to good foreign relations and for her enhancement of the prestige of the United States. The ship was also adjudged the outstanding seaplane tender in the Atlantic Fleet in 1957 and was awarded the Battle Readiness and Excellence Plaque and the Navy "E" in recognition of the accomplishment. During "Valcour"s 1960 Middle East cruise, she became the first American ship to visit the Seychelles Islands, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, since 1912. In 1963, "Valcour" earned her second Navy "E".
In between her deployments to the Middle East, "Valcour" conducted local operations out of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek at Virginia Beach, Virginia; Guantanamo Bay; and Kingston, Jamaica. Around 1960 "Valcour" received some conspicuous equipment upgrades, including a tripod mast with a newer air search radar and a tall communications antenna which, with its deckhouse, replaced the quadruple 40-millimeter antiaircraft gun mount on her fantail. In 1965, she qualified as a "blue nose" by crossing the Arctic Circle during operations in the Norwegian Sea.
"Valcour" completed her 15th Middle East cruise on 13 March 1965.
Service as "miscellaneous command flagship" (AGF-1) 1966–1971.
"Valcour" departed the United States for the Middle East on 18 April 1966 for her 16th MidEastFor cruise, and her first as AGF-1. Tasked to demonstrate American interest and good will in the Middle East, "Valcour" distributed textbooks, medicine, clothing, and domestic machinery (such as sewing machines) to the needy under the auspices of Project Handclasp. Men from "Valcour" attempted to promote good relations with the countries "Valcour" visited by assisting in the construction of orphanages and schools, by participating in public functions, and by entertaining dignitaries, military representatives, and civilians. In addition, while watching merchant shipping lanes, "Valcour" had standing requirements to assist stricken ships and to evacuate Americans during crises in Middle Eastern countries.
Based at Bahrain, "Valcour" remained in the Middle East, save for a winter overhaul at Norfolk in 1968-69, until 1971. She became the permanent flagship for ComMidEastFor in 1971, but was selected in January 1972 for inactivation.
Relieved as flagship by miscellaneous command flagship (ex-landing platform dock) (ex-LPD-3) in the spring of 1972, "Valcour" returned to Norfolk via Colombo; Singapore; Brisbane, Australia; Wellington, New Zealand; Tahiti; Panama; and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. After four days at Fort Lauderdale, she arrived at Norfolk on 11 November 1972, completing an 18,132-nautical mile (33,580-kilometer) voyage from the Middle East.
Decommissioning and disposal.
After being stripped of all usable gear over the ensuing months, "Valcour" was decommissioned on 15 January 1973; her name was struck from the Navy List simultaneously with her decommissioning. She shifted to the Inactive Ship Facility at Portsmouth, Virginia, so that she could be prepared for service as a test-bed for electromagnetic tests held under the auspices of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL), White Oak, Maryland. Towed from Norfolk to the Solomons Island, Maryland, branch of NOL in March 1974, she soon thereafter began her service as a test ship for the Electromagnetic Pulse Radiation Environment Simulation for Ships (EMPRESS) facility.
The U.S. Navy sold "Valcour" on 1 May 1977 for scrapping.

Inner Belt District

The Inner Belt District is a industrial district located in the southeastern portion of Somerville, Massachusetts. Along with nearby Brickbottom, the Inner Belt is a historically industrial zone of Somerville, with factories, warehouses, distribution centers, railroad connections, regional maintenance facilities, MBTA and Amtrak offices, retail stores and a hotel.
Named after the proposed but doomed Inner Belt Highway, the district is bounded by Interstate 93, Route 28, and the Lowell and Fitchburg rail lines. Inner Belt Road runs through the center of the Inner Belt District intersecting with 3rd Avenue to connect to the MBTA maintenance facility. Although adjacent to the McGrath Corridor, NorthPoint in Cambridge and Sullivan Square in Charlestown, it is isolated from them by highways and rail lines. 
An elevated railroad right-of-way separates the Brickbottom area located to the west of the Inner Belt District. The two areas resemble each other in terms of use. However, Brickbottom has older dense development in a grid pattern and has a couple of small neighborhoods. Somerville is currently engaged in an ongoing community process, begun in 2011, to determine a long-term Master Plan for the Inner Belt and Brickbottom region. A draft of the plan should be available for public comment by the end of 2013.
History.
Like many areas in today’s modern cities, the Inner Belt District bears little resemblance to what the area looked like when it was first being settled. The area was primarily marshland and the Miller's River, which has since been filled in, flowed along the southern edge. As industry began to enter into the area in the early- to mid-1800s, the landscape was changed to suit the needs of new businesses. Cobble Hill was brought down and used to fill in the marshes. Miller’s River was used first by the new industries to discharge their pollutants, and was eventually filled as well. 
By the 1930s, the whole sub-district, with the exception of the strip of land between Washington Street and what is now New Washington Street, was completely taken over by the Boston and Maine Railroad. The remaining portion of land south of Washington Street was used for heavy industry that was rail dependent. In the late 1940s, freight transportation began to shift away from rail to the open roads and once-valuable rail yards were slowly removed to make way for new industrial uses. A new industrial park was planned for the Yard 10 in the space between what is now New Washington Street and the Lowell Line. 
By the mid-1950s, a new regional expressway called the Inner Belt was planned that would bisect the site between the older industrial buildings on Washington Street and the new industrial buildings on the former Yard 10 land. Called the Inner Belt Expressway, it would have connected I-93 on the east with Massachusetts Route 2 in the west following the path of the Fitchburg Railroad through Porter Square. After years of protest and community organizing, plans for the Inner Belt Expressway were withdrawn and the right of way that is now New Washington Street was transferred to the city. 
Although the Inner Belt was stopped, housing in the Brickbottom neighborhood and the adjacent neighborhood to the its east between the MBTA Lowell Line and I-93 was cleared in the 1950s for an urban renewal plan to create a Somerville Industrial Park that would benefit from the anticipated highway network. The purpose of the renewal plan was to destroy the existing neighborhood grid pattern and reorganize the area to accommodate the Interstate, provide automobile circulation and parking, and establish single-use zoning. 
With the anticipation of the Inner Belt, the Inner Belt District was advertised in a real estate booklet as a "unique parcel combines the advantages of a suburban type development and a downtown location." The assets of the area that were marketed to potential investors remain the area’s strong points: accessibility, proximity to Boston and the region, auto-designed roads, and a large work force nearby. In 1968, the Somerville Redevelopment Authority created an Urban Renewal District for the land between Washington and New Washington streets. 
During the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, little significant development influenced the area. Like many U.S. cities, industrial and manufacturing companies left the area, to be replaced by primarily service class.
New proposed development opportunities.
Soccer stadium.
The Kraft Group has discussed the possibility of building a soccer stadium for the New England Revolution in the district. It would be able to accommodate up to 20,000 spectators. Construction and operation of a stadium would create jobs and stimulate commercial revenue, but the facility would take up a great deal of the Inner Belt District while sitting vacant much of the year.

Shishbarak

Shishbarak (, also known as Tatarbari in Iraq, can be transliterated as shushbarak) is a pasta or jiaozi dish made in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine that has been described as a kind of local variation on ravioli. After being stuffed with ground beef and spices, thin wheat dough parcels are cooked in yogurt and served hot in this sauce. 
Though a part of Arab cuisine for centuries, the dish originated in pre-Islamic Persia where it was known by the name "joshpara" - "josh" meaning "to boil" and "para" being more obscure, though it could mean "bit". The Arabic name "shishbarak" is thought to derive directly from this name which was in use prior to the 10th century, after which it was supplanted by the modern Persian name "gosh e-barreh", meaning "lamb's ear". Variations of the earlier name in other languages include the Azerbaijani "düshbara", Uzbeki "chuchwara", and Uighur "chöchürä". Finno-Ugric peoples in western Siberia exposed to the dish by Iranian merchants in the Middle Ages gave it the name "pelnan" meaning "ear bread". It was adopted from them by Russians in the 17th century, with its pronunciation altered to "pel'meni" and chicken broth used as a substitute for the yogurt broth.
A recipe for "shushbarak" appears in the 15th century Arabic cookbook from Damascus, "Kitab al-tibakha".

When the 7" vinyl copies of the split with Pleasant Valley were sold out, there were still some copies of the sleeve, so the band created this EP.
It comprises songs from a few different sources. The first two tracks are pre-production versions of songs found on "Stigmata High-Five". They were originally released on vinyl splits with Mesrine and Pleasant Valley. The other songs are live songs originally intended to be released on a split with Mincing Fury on Burning Dogma Records, however, the owner of the label went to jail before it could be released.
"Taken From The Nest" and "The Wreaking" were recorded in Ottawa by Matt Connell in October and November of 2005 respectively. The live tracks were recorded at a show on November 13, 2005 at Maverick's in Ottawa with Exhumed, Averse Sefira and Eclipse Eternal.

Fasciolariidae

Fasciolariidae, common name the "tulip snails and spindle snails", is a family of small to large sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Buccinoidea.
The family Fasciolariidae probably appeared about 110 million years ago during the Cretaceous 
Distribution.
The recent species inhabit tropical to temperate waters.
Description.
The shells are usually reddish in color and have a moderate to large size, reaching a height between 1.0 cm and 60 cm. The shells are spindle-shaped and biconic. The spire is elongate. The siphonal canal is well developed and is long to moderately long. The columella varies between a smooth appearance and showing spiral folds. The horny operculum has an oval shape. Their radula is characteristic with narrow central teeth with three cusps. The wide lateral teeth show numerous ctenoid (= comblike) cusps.
Snails in the family Fasciolariidae are carnivorous. They feed on other gastropods and on bivalves. Some also prey on worms and barnacles.
The snails are gonochoristic, i.e. the individuals have just one sex. The female snails deposit their eggs in horny capsules either in a single form or in clusters arranged arranged around a hollow axis. The single forms have a flattened, disk-shaped or vase-shaped form. The clusters are hemispherical or cylindrical. Development is usually direct. The larvae emerge from the capsules as free-swimming young or as crawling young.
Taxonomy.
According to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) the family Fasciolariidae consists of three subfamilies:
Genera.
Genera in the family Fasciolariidae include (fossil genera are marked with a dagger):

Godzilla Generations

A sequel titled "" was released in Japan the following year.
Gameplay.
Players control one of five monsters from the Godzilla universe, initially only Godzilla and Mechagodzilla can be selected, the other characters are unlocked by progressing through the game. The game world is composed of five cities, each comprising two stages, except the final city which has three. The object of the game is to proceed to the next stage by destroying everything on the stage within a set time limit, such as buildings and trees. Each character has projectile attacks, the ability to block incoming attacks and the ability to heal themselves.
Reception.
"Godzilla Generations" received lukewarm reviews from Japanese gaming magazine "Famitsu" and a very negative response from Western journalists, despite fans showing interest in the game at the 1998 Tokyo Game Show. Computer and Video Games' reviewer Kim Randell described the game as dull and cited issues such as poor controls, a constantly shifting camera and the player character blocking the player's view. Peter Bartholow of GameSpot derided the game as "terrible" and one of the worst games of 1998. Bartholow found it impossible to block incoming attacks due to the creatures' slow gait. He stated that because of this the developers added a healing ability to each creature, allowing players to continue through the game without fear of their character dying, "There's no strategy, no technique. Just the extreme tedium of tromping through cities."
Despite showing interest in a preview, describing the game as looking like "a riot", Jaz Rignall of IGN and his colleagues were less enthusiastic when their first Dreamcast console arrived three months later with three Japanese launch games. He found "while it brought many smiles and jeers, it didn't impress", the gathered journalists quickly lost interest and moved onto another game. In a November 2002 review of "", GameSpy's David Hodgson described himself as ""still wincing from Godzilla: Generations"". He went on to say the game "seemed to adhere to the loony premise that bizarre camera angles, a monster trudging in extreme slow motion, and the knuckle-gnawingly slow chipping away of scenery was the new in monstrous fighting action. It wasn't. It was crap".
Japan-GameCharts reports that the game sold approximately 22,870 copies.

Gay Power, Gay Politics

"Gay Power, Gay Politics" is a 1980 episode of the American documentary television series "CBS Reports". It was anchored by Harry Reasoner with reportage by George Crile. Crile also produced the episode with co-producer Grace Diekhaus. He conceived the show after becoming aware of the 1979 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights and took as his focus the 1979 San Francisco mayoral election. After intermittent shooting over several months in 1979 with the cooperation of prominent members of the city's LGBT community, CBS aired "Gay Power, Gay Politics" on April 26, 1980.
Although described by CBS as a report on the growing influence of the LGBT community in San Francisco politics, "Gay Power, Gay Politics" focused largely on the supposed sexual practices of the gay male community, especially sadomasochism. The documentary sparked outrage in the city and CBS was roundly criticized for its journalistic tactics. The National News Council, a media watchdog organization, found that CBS had violated journalistic standards through misrepresentation purposely to reinforce stereotypes and through deceptive editing.
"Gay Power, Gay Politics" was used as a tool of the religious right to block or repeal anti-discrimination ordinances. Its reportage is still used to support views on homosexuality that are outside the mainstream of current psychological thought. LGBT writers and theorists have continued to criticize the documentary, although some have suggested that there is some truth to its assertions.
Production.
George Crile became interested in making "Gay Power, Gay Politics" after learning of the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights scheduled for October 1979. Crile had earlier produced a piece on assassinated San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk that ran on the program "CBS Magazine". For this new program, he intended to focus on the 1979 San Francisco mayoral election and the political strength of the gay voting bloc in the city, which the several candidates were courting. He brought Grace Diekhaus in to co-produce with him and secured approval from CBS.
Filming began in the summer of 1979 and continued periodically through November, with the production team shooting in several intervals for a few days each. A number of prominent gay activists, including Armistead Maupin, Cleve Jones and Sally Gearhart, assisted Crile and Diekhaus with the project, although Gearhart and fellow activist Del Martin began questioning their motives, coming to believe the network "was out to do a hatchet job". Crile interviewed Gearhart for the piece but by the date of her interview she was so mistrustful of the producers that she took measures to try to prevent herself from being misrepresented. "I would lift my voice at a certain point so what I said could not be cut. He seemed to want me to vilify Diane (sic) Feinstein in some way and set her in opposition to the gay community...During one of the breaks I told him that I didn't feel good about it...I felt I had been twisted and manipulated." Ultimately Gearhart's interview was cut entirely, for which she was "ecstatic". When Crile began his interview with then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein by asking "How does it feel to be the mayor of Sodom and Gomorrah?" Feinstein threw him and his crew out of her office.
Overview.
Anchor Harry Reasoner opened the hour with the following narration, over shots of the 1979 March on Washington: 
Crile's report, rather than exploring the thesis laid out by Reasoner, instead focused in large measure on sexual activity, including men cruising in Buena Vista Park and interviews with so-called sadomasochism consultants. He reported that one out of every ten deaths in San Francisco was attributable to gay men participating in BDSM and that one gay-oriented BDSM establishment's clientele engaged in sexual activity "so dangerous that they have a gynecological table there with a doctor and nurse on hand to sew people up." He compared San Francisco to the Weimar Republic, asking Cleve Jones, "Isn't it a sign of decadence when you have so many gays emerging, breaking apart all the values of a society?" Crile also included footage of Feinstein, in the midst of a run-off election to retain her mayorship, appearing before the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, an LGBT Democrat organization. The program as aired showed Feinstein apologizing for remarks she had made in an earlier "Ladies' Home Journal" interview, followed immediately by applause.
Following footage of Jones at a candlelight vigil for Harvey Milk and additional footage from the March on Washington, Reasoner closed with: 
Criticism.
Representation of the gay community and journalistic standards.
Crile and CBS were sharply criticized for the reporting and editing practices used in the documentary. A gay journalist named Randy Alfred, who had covered many of the same campaign events that were included in the episode, spent some 300 hours researching what he believed to be factual errors and misrepresentations within the broadcast. By July 10 he had prepared a 20-page complaint outlining 44 alleged instances of misrepresentation which he filed with the National News Council, a media watchdog organization. "Gay Power, Gay Politics", Alfred said, relied on "a systematic use of hearsay, oversights, exaggerations, distortions, inflammatory buzzwords, leading questions, and misleading and deceitful editing" that had as its result "patterned distortion". Of particular note was the scene of Feinstein at the Harvey Milk Democratic Club. The editor had inserted applause immediately after Feinstein apologized for her earlier "Ladies' Home Journal" comments, which Crile had described as Feinstein's "groveling to atone". The applause had in fact come after her condemnation of anti-gay violence and a promise to appoint a gay or lesbian member of the police commission.
In response to complaints before the episode even aired, CBS had flown the producers to San Francisco, where in an interview with local CBS affiliate KPIX the pair acknowledged that the material for the show was selected for its likelihood to be shocking. Two months after Alfred's complaint to the NNC, CBS defended its people. Network vice-president Robert Chandler dismissed the bulk of Alfred's complaints as "trivial, irrelevant or clearly represent matters of opinion or judgment". Chandler went on to acknowledge that the applause was broadcast out of sequence but denied that it was intended to deceive. "Whatever the motivation, it is clear that our producers indicated the applause out of its actual time sequence and therefore misled our viewers. This, then, constitutes an acknowledgment of error and an apology for a breach of our own journalistic standards." Regarding the program as a whole, Chandler denied any bias.
The NNC met on September 18, 1980 to consider Alfred's allegations. After dismissing many of them as without merit, The NNC found by a vote of 9–2 that CBS had unfairly misrepresented a number of sexual issues, including in the BDSM scenes. "By concentrating on certain flamboyant examples of homosexual behavior the program tended to reinforce stereotypes... The program exaggerated political concessions to gays and made them appear as threats to public morals and decency." CBS was also found to have offered distorted coverage of the city's annual Beaux Arts Ball and to have manipulated the soundtrack by adding the applause. The network later apologized for this on the air, the first time that the LGBT community had received an apology from a major news organization.
Many in the city were angered by the broadcast. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors was outraged and sent a letter of protest to CBS. Feinstein wrote to the station manager of KPIX denouncing the episode. She compared the program to "doing a documentary on Italians and only showing the Mafia". She asked for three minutes of national airtime to respond but CBS denied her request. Armistead Maupin, who had worked closely with the production team, repudiated the program, saying "I had no idea they were doing a hit piece." Jeff Jarvis of "The San Francisco Examiner" wrote, "It's shocking that CBS News, home of Walter Cronkite, would partake of such bigotry." Writing for the "San Francisco Chronicle", Terrence O'Flaherty labeled the documentary "a dreadful little program... deadly for everyone it touches". Nationally, a spokesperson for the National Gay Task Force condemned the documentary for its premise of gays wanting political power for purposes of having sex in public, for ignoring lesbians and for failing to address issues of anti-gay discrimination.
Representation of BDSM.
"Gay Power, Gay Politics" has also been criticized for its negative portrayal of the BDSM sub-culture. CBS used BDSM to discredit the LGBT community by implying that an increase in gay political power would correspond with an increase in BDSM and BDSM-related deaths. The program also miscategorized BDSM as an exclusively gay male activity, despite the fact that most of the BDSM material filmed for the documentary was shot at a location called The Chateau, which had a heterosexual customer base. Reporter Crile interviewed San Francisco coroner Dr. Boyd Stephens, who stated that 10% of homicides in the city were gay-related and that some of those were related to the BDSM community. His words, which Stephens would later acknowledge were based on hearsay, were widely and inaccurately reported as meaning that 10% of all homicides in San Francisco were related to BDSM.
Anti-LGBT backlash.
Following the airing of the report, the Community United Against Violence (CUAV), a San Francisco group dedicated to addressing anti-gay violence in the city, reported a 400% increase of reported violent incidents against LGBT people. This marked a reversal of the decrease in violence reports to that point in 1980. Right-wing groups used "Gay Power, Gay Politics" as a fundraising tool until CBS forced them to stop. The Moral Majority, in its successful campaign to repeal a San Jose, California gay rights ordinance, used an image from the program along with the slogan "Don't Let It Spread!" on billboards. In 1985, a Houston group opposed to a proposed LGBT rights ordinance for the city used clips from the program in its commercials and voters overwhelmingly rejected the ordinance. Controversial psychologist Paul Cameron, on behalf of the right wing Family Research Institute, has used the 10% homicide figure to support his views on homosexuality, views which have been repudiated by a number of professional psychological and sociological associations.
Continued criticism.
"Gay Power, Gay Politics" continued to be a target of criticism by LGBT community leaders and authors, although some have acknowledged that the program included "more than a few kernels of truth". Former National Gay and Lesbian Task Force executive director Urvashi Vaid attacked the program for its presentation of gays as "sexual hedonists, privileged powerbrokers, and arrogant men scheming to force their 'lifestyle' on a recalcitrant public". She further castigated the show for excluding lesbians and people of color (although she acknowledges that this to an extent mirrored the state of gay leadership at the time) and noted her belief that anti-gay attack videos produced in the 1990s were modeled on this broadcast. Gay cultural critic Frank Browning, while agreeing with the criticism of the tone of the documentary, nonetheless found the dudgeon that many in the community expressed to be "layered with disingenuousness". Browning wrote: 
While echoing criticism about the exclusion of lesbian concerns and the distortions contained in the broadcast, Browning went on to note that sexual freedom has always been part of the gay male agenda and that it would be absurd to pretend otherwise.

"Hatteras" was to have been one of 41 "Barnegat"-class small seaplane tenders the U.S. Navy planned to commission during the early 1940s, and was to have been built at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. However, by the spring of 1943 the Navy deemed that number of seaplane tenders excess to requirements, and decided to complete four of them as motor torpedo boat tenders and one as a catapult training ship. In addition, the Navy also decided to cancel six of the "Barnegat"-class ships prior to their construction, freeing up the diesel engines that would have powered them for use in escort vessels and amphibious landing craft.
"Hatteras" became one of the first four ships to be cancelled when the Navy cancelled its contract with Lake Washington Shipyard for her construction on 22 April 1943.

Yehuda Gilad (politician)

Rabbi Yehuda Gilad (, born 30 August 1955) is a former Israeli politician who served as a member of the Knesset for Meimad between 2002 and 2003.
Biography.
Born in Brazil, Gilad made aliyah to Israel at the age of seven. He was certified as a rabbi, and headed a yeshiva. In the early 1990s he worked as an emissary for the Jewish Agency and Bnei Akiva in London, and was a programme director for Gesher, an organisation dedicated to bridging the gap between secular and religious youths.
For the 1999 elections he was placed 33rd on the One Israel list (an alliance of Labor, Meimad and Gesher), but missed out on a seat when the alliance won only 26 seats. In 2002 he became chairman of the Meimad secretariat, and on 5 June 2002, he entered the Knesset as a replacement for Maxim Levy. He lost his seat in the 2003 elections. 
He is now a Rosh Yeshivah at Yeshivat Maale Gilboa and the rabbi of Kibbutz Lavi. He frequently writes articles on topical issues related to Israel and Judaism.

1924–25 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

1924–25 Huddersfield Town F.C. season saw Town retain their title for the second consecutive season. Under the guidance of Herbert Chapman, they won the title by 2 clear points from West Bromwich Albion. The mood suddenly changed at the end of the season when Chapman suddenly resigned.
Review.
After winning their first title, Herbert Chapman's team didn't want to give their title back in a hurry, winning their first 4 games and being unbeaten for their 10 league games. Town's defensive line were particularly impressive, only conceding 28 goals during the league season and never conceded more than 2 in any league game. They only conceded 3 goals in their FA Cup game against Bolton Wanderers. They won their 2nd title by 2 points from West Bromwich Albion. However, Town were left bewildered when Herbert Chapman left for Arsenal at the end of the season.

Construction and commissioning.
"Hempstead" was to have been one of 41 "Barnegat"-class small seaplane tenders the U.S. Navy planned to commission during the early 1940s, and was to have been built at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. However, by the spring of 1943 the Navy deemed that number of seaplane tenders excess to requirements, and decided to complete four of them as motor torpedo boat tenders and one as a catapult training ship. In addition, the Navy also decided to cancel six of the "Barnegat"-class ships prior to their construction, freeing up the diesel engines that would have powered them for use in escort vessels and amphibious landing craft.
"Hempstead" became one of the first four ships to be cancelled when the Navy cancelled its contract with Lake Washington Shipyard for her construction on 22 April 1943.

United States presidential election in Connecticut, 2008

The 2008 United States presidential election in Connecticut took place on November 4, 2008 throughout all 50 states and D.C., which was part of the 2008 United States presidential election. Voters chose 7 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
Connecticut was won by Democratic nominee Barack Obama with a 22.4% margin of victory. Connecticut was one of the six states that had every county—including traditionally Republican Litchfield County—go for Obama, the others being Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Connecticut has not voted for a Republican presidential nominee since 1988 when the state was carried by George H.W. Bush over Michael Dukakis.
Campaign.
Predictions.
There were 17 news organizations who made state by state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day:
Polling.
Barack Obama won every single poll taken in the state, and every one of them by a double digit margin of victory.
Fundraising.
John McCain raised a total of $3,966,985. Barack Obama raised $9,727,617.
Advertising and visits.
Obama spent $730,335 while McCain spent nothing on the state. Neither campaign visited the state.
Analysis.
Connecticut is a part of New England, an area of the country that has recently turned into a Democratic stronghold. The state went Republican in every election but two from 1952 to 1988. However, Bill Clinton narrowly carried it in 1992, and the state has not been seriously contested since. McCain ceded the state to Obama early on, despite Independent Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman's endorsement.
In 2006, Democrats knocked off two incumbent Republicans and picked up two U.S. House seats in CT-02 and CT-05 (Joe Courtney and Chris Murphy, respectively). Although then-Governor M. Jodi Rell and Lieutenant Governor Michael Fedele were both moderate Republicans, all other statewide offices were held by Democrats. Democrats also enjoyed a supermajority status in both chambers of the Connecticut state legislature.
In 2008, Democrat Jim Himes defeated incumbent Republican Christopher Shays, who was at the time the only Republican member of the U.S. House from New England, for the U.S. House seat in Connecticut's 4th congressional district. This was largely because Obama carried the district with a staggering 60 percent of the vote—one of his best performances in a Republican-held district. Shays' defeat meant that for the first time in almost 150 years, there were no Republican Representatives from New England. In no other part of the country is a major political party completely shut out. At the same time at the state level, Democrats picked up six seats in the Connecticut House of Representatives and one seat in the Connecticut Senate.
Results breakdown.
By congressional district.
Barack Obama carried all five of Connecticut’s congressional districts.
Electors.
Technically the voters of CT cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. CT is allocated 7 electors because it has 5 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 7 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 7 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.
The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.
The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 7 were pledged to Barack Obama and Joe Biden:

James Bisset

James Bisset (ca. 1762 – 17 August 1832) was a Scottish-born artist, manufacturer, writer, collector, art dealer and poet, who spent most of his life in and around Birmingham, England.
Bisset was born in Perth, the son of a merchant who invested the Baltic flax trade but had fallen upon hard times. He was educated at Perth Academy until 1776 when he moved at the age of 13 to Birmingham, where his brother had established himself as a merchant. At the age of 15 Bisset obtained an apprenticeship with a Birmingham japanner, and by 1785 was listed in a local trade directory as a painter of miniatures. His invention of a method of painting on the inside of convex glasses enabled him to develop a successful business making ornamental goods and marry the daughter of a local landowner, and the early years of the nineteenth century saw him diversifying into medal-production and art dealing.
In 1808 Bisset moved to a large house in New Street where he established a museum and picture gallery - Birmingham's first - that displayed everything from paintings and medals to stuffed wildlife and "works of savage nations", and was visited by both Sir William Hamilton, the greatest collector of his day, and Horatio Nelson. In 1813 he sold two paintings by Canaletto and moved to nearby Leamington Spa, where his museum was re-established by his wife Dolly.
Bisset was a notable figure in Birmingham's cultural and commercial life, a prominent member of the Birmingham Book Club and a composer of much published verse. His most notable work is his 1800 "Poetic survey round Birmingham, with a brief description of the different curiosities and manufactures of the place, accompanied with a magnificent directory, with the names and professions, &c. superbly engraved in emblematic plates" - a directory of Birmingham trades at the time of the town's revolutionary industrial expansion, written in heroic verse and intended as a "grand tour" of the "works of genius" of a "seat of the arts".

1964 Rose Bowl

The 1964 Rose Bowl was the 50th Rose Bowl Game, played on January 1, 1964. It featured the Illinois Fighting Illini against the Washington Huskies.
Illinois was led by Dick Butkus, Jim Grabowski, Lynn Stewart, and Archie Sutton on their way to a 17–7 victory over the Huskies, led by Junior Coffey.
Washington scored first and led 7–0, until late in the first half. Washington's score came following an Illinois fumble at its own 27-yard line. Backup quarterback, Bill Siler, kept it for three yards, then passed it to Joe Mancuso for 18 yards to the Illini 6. Siler then faked a pass and pitched to halfback Dave Kopay, who scored behind the block of halfback Ron Medved, with 8:26 left in the first half.
The Illini's first score came on Jim Plankerton's field goal in the waning seconds of the second quarter. In the third quarter, Jim Warren scored the "go-ahead" touchdown on a two-yard run in the third quarter. Grabowski rushed for 125 yards, and scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter. Grabowski was named the game's Most Valuable Player. Dick Butkus played both ways in this contest, both at center and linebacker. He recovered a fumble, and had an interception (in addition to leading a defense that held Washington to only 59 yards rushing and 71 yards passing for the game).
Aftermath.
Both opposing running backs, Junior Coffey and Jim Grabowski, were drafted by the Green Bay Packers, Coffey in 1965 and Grabowski in 1966.

SV Göppingen

SV Göppingen is a German association football club from the city of Göppingen, Baden-Württemberg. The team was established on 13 October 1905 as "1. Göppingener Fuβballverein" and lays claim to being the oldest football club in the city. On 24 April 1920, soon after World War I the club merged with "Athletiksportverein 1895 Göppingen" and took on its current identity. The origins of predecessor side "ASV" go back to 11 August 1895 formation of "1. Athletik Klub Göppingen". This club merged with "Kraftsportverein Fortuna Göppingen" in 1901 to become "Athleten-Klub Foruna Göppingen". They adopted the name "Athletiksportverein Göppingen" early in 1907, and in 1911 merged with "Sportclub Göppingen".
__TOC__
History.
"SV" first came to notice in 1934 when they became part of the Gauliga Württemberg, one of 16 top-flight divisions created in the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich a year earlier. The club only spent the 1934–35 and 1936–37 seasons in first division play, being sent down on both occasions after 10th place finishes. They returned to the Gauliga in 1943, captured the division title, and then went out in the opening round of the national playoffs to "KSG Saarbrücken" (3:5). The following season was that last before World War II interrupted play across the country.
After the war, "Göppingen" took up play in the Landesliga Württemberg (II), but was sent down in 1948 after just three seasons. It was not until 1968 that they returned to third tier competition in the Amateurliga Nordwürttemberg. They finished second and the next year took the division title, which led to their participation in the national amateur championship playoffs. "SV" moved on to the semifinals where they were eliminated 1:0, 2:1 by "SC Jülich 1910".
In league play, a successful promotion playoff advanced "SV" to the Regionalliga Süd (II) where they found themselves overmatched. They returned to the Amateurliga Nordwürttemberg (III) which later (1980) became the Amateuroberliga Baden-Württemberg (III). They enjoyed a string of strong finishes through the late 70s before slipping away to lower tier local play in the mid-80s. It was during this period that they made appearances in the opening rounds of the German Cup tournament (1975, 1980, 1984). "SV" played first in the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg (III) until 1985, then in the Verbandsliga Württemberg (IV) until 1991 and then descended through the Landesliga Württemberg (V) to the Bezirksliga (VI) in 1994. Since 2007, "SV" have played in the Landesliga Württemberg (VI), from where they earned promotion back to the Verbandsliga in 2009.

Chapelton v Barry Urban District Council

Chapelton v Barry Urban District Council 1 KB 532 is an English contract law case on offer and acceptance and exclusion clauses. It stands for the proposition that a display of goods can be an offer, rather than an invitation to treat, and serves as an example for how onerous exclusion clauses can be deemed to not be incorporated in a contract.
Facts.
David Chapelton went to a beach with his friend, Miss Andrews, at Cold Knap. There was a pile of deckchairs. A notice next to them said,
"Barry Urban District Council. Cold Knap. Hire of chairs $2. per session of 3 hours."
It also said tickets should be obtained from attendants. Mr Chapelton got two chairs from an attendant, paid the money and got two tickets. He put them in his pocket. On the ticket was written,
"Available for three hours. Time expires where indicated by cut-off and should be retained and shown on request. The council will not be liable for any accident or damage arising from the hire of the chair."
When Mr Chapelton sat on the chair it gave way, the canvas tearing from the top of the chair. He was injured. The County Court judge held the council was negligent but that liability was exempted by the ticket. Mr Chapelton appealed.
Judgment.
The Court of Appeal upheld Mr Chapelton's claim. He held that there was a valid offer when the chairs were on display, accepted when picked up the chairs from the defendant. Therefore, the ticket was merely a receipt of the contract, and the exclusion clause could not be incorporated as a term, because it was too late. Slesser LJ read the facts and gave his judgment first.

Teopanzolco

Teopanzolco is an Aztec archaeological site in the Mexican state of Morelos. Due to urban growth, it now lies within the modern city of Cuernavaca. Most of the visible remains date from the Middle to Late Postclassic Period (1300-1521).
Etymology.
"Teopanzolco" comes from the Nahuatl language, it has been interpreted as "the place of the old temple".
Location.
Teopanzolco was built upon a hill formed from a lava flow. Although this area is now occupied by the Vista Hermosa district of Cuernavaca, in pre-Columbian times it was an area of coniferous woodland.
History of the site.
The Morelos Valley was settled from about 2000 BC. During the Classic Period, Teopanzolco came under the influence of the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. By the Postclassic, various Nahua groups had moved into the "Altiplano"; the Tlahuicas founded nearby Cuauhnahuac (Cuernavaca) and Teopanzolco itself. They were conquered in 1427 AD by the Aztec emperor Moctezuma Ilhuicamina, after which they were integrated into the Aztec Empire and were obliged to pay tribute and participate in Aztec military campaigns. The prehispanic history of Teopanzolco was brought to a close by the Spanish Conquest in 1521, at which time the Tlahuicas were still living in the area and paying tribute to the Aztecs.
Teopanzolco was probably the original centre of the city of Cuauhnahuac during the Early Aztec period (AD 1150–1350) before the ceremonial centre was moved to a more defensible location, now the centre of the modern city of Cuernavaca. After the relocation of the ceremonial centre no new construction was undertaken at Teopanzolco.
The site of Teopanzolco was rediscovered in 1910, during the Mexican Revolution, when the revolutionary forces of Emiliano Zapata installed an artillery emplacement upon the Great Platform (Building 1) in order to shell federalist positions in the centre of Cuernavaca. The resulting cannon fire shook loose the soil, revealing the stonework below.
The modern history of Teopanzolco begins with the first excavations at the site in 1921, no further investigations took place until it was excavated in 1956-7 by Mexican archaeologists Román Piña Chan and Eduardo Noguera, who investigated the temple of Ehecatl and established a ceramic sequence for the site. Further archaeological investigations took place in 1968-9 (by Angulo Villaseñor) and in 1980 (by Wanda Tomassi). INAH has undertaken maintenance and minor excavations annually since 1985.
The site.
Only the ceremonial centre of Teopanzolco has been preserved. The residential areas of the prehispanic city lie beneath the modern development of Vista Hermosa, for this reason the actual size of the city is unknown. The surviving remains were built using local basalt. Although nothing survives of the original finishing, the buildings were presumably covered with painted plaster, as at other archaeological sites. Although the site had been developed by both the Tlahuicas and the Aztecs, the dominant architectural style and the majority of the excavated ceramics are Aztec in origin.
The site is in the care of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia ("National Institute of Anthropology and History") and is open to the public.

Christina Mae "Tina" Thomas Watson, a 26-year-old American from Alabama, died while scuba diving on her honeymoon in Queensland, Australia on 22 October 2003. She was a newlywed, having married a fellow American, David Gabriel "Gabe" Watson, 11 days earlier. He was initially charged by Queensland authorities with his wife's murder. This was changed to manslaughter with a guilty plea. He was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment for her manslaughter. 
At trial, evidence presented included Gabe Watson's differing accounts of what had happened on that day, of the couple's diving experience (or lack thereof), and of Tina Watson's life insurance. While he was serving his term, authorities in Alabama flagged an intention to charge him with murder at a later date. After his release, he was deported from Australia to Alabama. Australian authorities would only return him to the United States once an assurance was in place that Watson would not be sentenced to the death penalty if found guilty of murder. He was then charged by Alabama authorities with Tina Watson's murder and was put on trial. However on 23 February 2012, Alabama judge Tommy Nail dismissed the murder case due to alleged lack of evidence, over the objections of prosecutors.
Death of Tina Watson.
Gabe Watson met Tina Thomas while they were students at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Tina took beginning diving lessons and earned her certification just before the two were married in October 2003. Watson, a purportedly qualified certified rescue diver, had planned a scuba trip in the Great Barrier Reef for their honeymoon.
During an excursion on the dive boat "Spoilsport" to the site of the SS "Yongala", a passenger ship that sank in 1911, Tina lost consciousness and sank to the bottom, below the water's surface within two minutes of beginning the dive. Watson claimed the currents were stronger than they expected and that he responded to a signal from her to return to the dive rope where he noted a look of worry on her face before she accidentally knocked his mask loose. When he recovered his sight, she was sinking too quickly for him to retrieve her and he surfaced to get help. He also stated that an ear problem prevented him from diving deeper to help her and that there was nothing in his training as a rescue diver "about how to get somebody" in trouble to the surface. 
Other divers were nearby at the time, including Dr. Stanley Stutz, who saw Watson engaged in an underwater "bear hug" with his "flailing" wife, after which he headed for the surface while his wife fell to the ocean floor. A fellow diver, Gary Stempler, photographed Watson by chance while taking a picture of his own wife that showed Tina in the background. The photo revealed Tina lying on the ocean floor, something that did not come to light until a couple of weeks later when the pictures were developed. Watson climbed aboard the "Spoilsport" and alerted dive instructor Wade Singleton, who brought Tina to the surface. She was taken aboard the adjacent dive boat "Jazz II", where a doctor tried to resuscitate her while Watson remained on the "Spoilsport".
Autopsy report.
The day following Tina's death, an autopsy was performed by Professor David Williams, consultant forensic pathologist to the Queensland Coroner. Williams found florid evidence of air embolism, but no degenerative disease. He gave the cause of death as drowning.
Investigation.
As Tina Watson's death was unexpected, it was investigated by the State Coroner's office. A coronial inquiry was held, as is the usual practice in Australia. Gabe Watson gave evidence to the inquest through his lawyers and to the Queensland police. The incident came under investigation due to the implausible and conflicting statements given by Watson. He declined to return to Australia and did not testify during the inquest. During the inquest, prosecutors submitted evidence that Watson's story contradicted the record of his actions stored by his dive computer. They suggested the possibility that he turned off Tina's air regulator and held her until she was unconscious, then turned the air back on and let her sink before surfacing himself. As evidence, they described painstaking multiple re-enactments of various scenarios conducted by police divers. Tina's father claimed that Gabe Watson had asked Tina, shortly before their wedding, to increase her life insurance and make him the sole beneficiary.
Civil action commenced in Alabama.
In March 2005, Watson launched legal action in Alabama's Jefferson County Circuit Court to recoup the cost of their trip after the travel insurance company refused a payout. He was seeking $45,000 for the accidental death plus compensation for trip interruption, medical expenses, phone calls, taxi fares, fees for extra credit card statements and unspecified punitive damages for mental and emotional anguish. The action was dismissed in May 2008 at Watson's request on the grounds the Australian investigation into his wife's death caused him "to reasonably apprehend that he risks self-incrimination in this case". His Australian legal team believed "it was not in his best interest" to pursue the damages claim and Watson's U.S.-based lawyer, Bob Austin, added that his client would not be voluntarily "going back to Australia".
Indictment.
On 19 June 2008, the Coroner laid the following charge:That on the 22nd day of October 2003 at the site of the historical shipwreck "Yongala" forty-eight nautical miles south east from the port of Townsville in the state of Queensland David Gabriel Watson murdered Christina Mae Watson.
It was reported that the Coroner found "that Watson likely killed his 26-year-old wife by turning off her air supply and holding her in an "underwater bear hug" until she was dead", however the coroner made no such finding.
Trial and sentence in Australia.
The Queensland state coroner found in 2008 evidence regarded as enough to try Watson for murder. He travelled voluntarily from the United States to Australia in May 2009 to face trial. At the trial on 5 June 2009, Watson pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. He was convicted of manslaughter. Crown prosecutor Brendan Campbell pointed out that over time Watson had given police 16 different versions of what had happened to Tina and that none of those versions matched what the only eyewitness had seen. When Tina was brought to the surface her respirator was still in her mouth, the air tank was full and tests indicated no faults with her equipment. The prosecutor described Watson as an experienced diver trained in rescuing panicked divers, who had allowed his wife to sink to the ocean floor without making any serious attempt to retrieve her. He did not inflate her buoyancy vest or remove weights from her belt, and failed in his duty as her dive buddy by not sharing his (alternate) air with her.
The prosecutor claimed Watson unlawfully killed Tina by failing in duty of care to fulfill his obligations as her "dive buddy" during the scuba dive. He said that when Tina grabbed for his air supply he did not give it to her and then swam away from her as she sank to the bottom of the sea bed. Gabe was sentenced to four and a half years in jail, to be suspended after serving only twelve months.
Reaction to the sentence.
Tina's family said that Gabe Watson's twelve month term was an embarrassment to Australia. The day following the trial, Alabama Attorney-General Troy King vowed to lodge an appeal with the Queensland Supreme Court. King also wrote to Queensland Attorney-General Cameron Dick. Fairfax Newspapers reported the letter was leaked to them and published part of it.
The Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions, Tony Moynihan SC, issued a statement the next business day, which said:
"The decision to accept Mr Watson’s plea of guilty to manslaughter was made after a careful and thorough examination of the admissible evidence, and was not taken lightly. Given the complex circumstantial nature of the case, Mr Watson’s admission that he breached his duty to render assistance to his wife ultimately meant there was no reasonable prospect of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was guilty of murder." On 18 June 2009, Dick announced the state would appeal against the inadequacy of Watson's sentence.
Appeal.
The appeal was heard by the Queensland Court of Appeals on 17 July 2009. The Crown asked the court to increase the prison time Watson would have to serve to two-and-a-half years. The defence argued that Watson had had a momentary lapse in judgment, had been accused of a crime he did not commit, and had voluntarily returned to Australia to co-operate with the court, the penalty imposed by the trial judge was fair and just. The findings on appeal were handed down on 18 September 2009. Two members allowed the prosecution's appeal, increasing Watson's period of incarceration by six months to a total of 18 months. One justice by minority opinion was in favour of dismissing the appeal.
Further incidents.
Tina Watson is buried in her native Pelham, Alabama. Her remains were exhumed and moved in 2007 to a different lot bought by her widower. After being informed by her family that flowers and gifts were repeatedly being vandalized or disappearing from the grave site, even when chained down, a police officer investigated. On hidden surveillance videos, he witnessed Watson removing them with bolt cutters and throwing them in trash cans. Watson later said he removed them because they were "big, gaudy, plastic arrangements." Her grave was unmarked until 2009 when Watson provided a foot marker, prompting her father to request her body be returned for reburial. In 2011, the Probate Court removed Watson as administrator of Tina's estate, appointing her father who also wants her school and college pictures and yearbooks returned. Watson has appealed against the ruling and refused to provide the court with an inventory of Tina's possessions. Pending Watson's trial, the Circuit Court ordered him to stay away from the grave.
On 15 August 2008, Watson married Kim Lewis. Reporters have described her as a "Tina Watson lookalike".
Trial in United States.
Alabama investigation.
In May 2010, Alabama Attorney-General Troy King announced he had information not yet made public and wanted to try Watson for capital murder. King petitioned Australia for the evidence held by police but was refused access until he gave an undertaking that the death penalty would not be imposed as required under Australian law. This condition has been strongly criticised by King and Don Valeska, chief of the attorney-general's violent crime division, who stated: "If an Australian woman was killed here, we would immediately send the evidence there. We would not presume to tell the Australian authorities how to run their criminal justice system". In response to the announcement, Watson's parents came to the defence of their son, breaking their public silence on the case. Friends and family of Watson questioned whether he had any motive for the murder noting, that his affection for Tina had seemed genuine, there was no life insurance policy naming him as beneficiary and he appeared to be emotionally devastated for an extended time following Tina's death.
In June 2010, King assured the Queensland Attorney-General he would not seek the death penalty if Watson was tried in the United States for his wife's death. In August 2010, it was announced Watson would be released in November and likely to be deported to the US, where he faced being charged with murder. Valeska stated he would pursue an additional charge of kidnapping by deception. The case was placed before a grand jury in Birmingham, Alabama in October 2010.
Watson was released from prison on 10 November 2010. He was transferred to an immigration detention centre while his deportation was delayed. During this time Australian authorities sought further written assurances from the US Attorney General that he would not face the death penalty in Alabama if convicted of murder. Under international human rights law, Australia could not deport Watson if he faced execution in his home country. On 25 November 2010, he was deported to the United States and immediately arrested.
Arrest.
Alabama prosecutors charged Gabe Watson with murder at the conclusion of his prison sentence in Australia after finding what they claimed was evidence he had plotted to kill his wife while still in the United States. A Birmingham grand jury indicted Watson on murder charges in October 2010. In July 2011, the Circuit Court set the trial date on 13 February 2012; Watson was released on bond.
New evidence.
Colin McKenzie, a key diving expert in the original investigation who had maintained that "a diver with Watson's training should have been able to bring Tina up", subsequently retracted much of his testimony after being provided with Tina and Gabe's diver logs, certificates and medical histories, to which he had not previously had access. McKenzie claimed Gabe Watson should not have been allowed in the water and never as a dive buddy for his wife, who had no open water scuba experience. Tina Watson had had heart surgery to correct an irregular heartbeat two years earlier but on her dive application had stated that she had never had heart problems or surgery. Professor Michael "Mike" Bennett, a leading expert in dive medicine, stated that Tina was unfit to dive without clearance from a cardiologist. Gabe Watson had received his rescue certification, normally a four day course, after completing a two day course in an Alabama quarry. Not only had his rescue certificate expired but he had no rescue experience and little open water experience.
According to McKenzie "He had no hope of being competent, he could barely save himself day let alone his wife, I don't believe he intended to kill her." Revelations that Watson needed help to don his diving equipment that day underscored that he was a "dangerous amateur" who showed "a complete lack of courage" when he abandoned his wife. The dive company had offered an orientation and guided dive with a dive master, which both Tina and Gabe Watson had refused. Company head Mike Ball said his people took Watson at his word, believing he was an experienced and certified rescue diver. The company later pleaded guilty to contravening safety standards and was fined $6500, plus costs of $1500.
Dismissal of the case.
Alabama judge Tommy Nail ruled that evidence of Watson's behavior following Tina's death was inadmissible. Nail also blocked Tina's father Tommy Thomas from giving evidence regarding Watson's alleged attempts to increase Tina's life insurance. On 23 February 2012, Nail acquitted Gabe Watson for lack of evidence without the defense needing to present its case. Nail said that the state's evidence was "sorely lacking" and that the prosecution could not prove that Watson had any financial motive. Prosecutor Don Valeska said that this was the first time he had had a trial end in a judge's acquittal in the 41 years he had been trying cases. Regarding the judge's decision, Thomas said, "It should have gone to the jury for them to decide."
Media coverage.
A feature on the death of Tina Watson was broadcast in a 90-minute account that aired on "Dateline NBC" on 19 May 2008. An examination of Tina Watson's death and Gabe Watson's subsequent trial and appeal was published by "The Age" on 17 July 2010. The author was Walkley Award winning investigative journalist, Peter Patrick. A feature on the death of Watson and her husband's Alabama acquittal was broadcast on an episode of the Australian "60 Minutes" on 25 March 2012.
Lifetime produced a made-for-TV movie, "Fatal Honeymoon", based on the death of Tina Watson, starring Harvey Keitel, Billy Miller and Amber Clayton. It premiered on 25 August 2012.

Imero Fiorentino

Imero (Immie) Fiorentino (July 12, 1928 – October 1, 2013) was an American lighting designer, considered one of the most respected pioneers and leaders in the American entertainment industry. Beginning his career as a lighting designer in the Golden Age of Television, he designed productions for such celebrated series as "Omnibus", "U.S. Steel Hour", "Pulitzer Prize Playhouse" and "Kraft Television Theatre". Fiorentino's expertise was often called upon by industry professionals throughout the world to consult on the planning and development of major productions, exhibits, museums and architectural projects; from the Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention and numerous United States presidential election debates, major concert tours and television specials to the environmental lighting for Epcot’s World Showcase at Walt Disney World. His consulting work on major corporate events with clients included: Anheuser-Busch, Michelin, Electrolux, American Express and Xerox.
Early life and education.
Fiorentino was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Sicilian parents Margaret Viola (a doll dress maker who later worked for a real estate agency) and Dominick Fiorentino (an artist who painted the faces on the Dy-Dee Dolls), who met in New York. As a young boy, he enjoyed trips to Radio City Music Hall with his uncle as he became more and more fascinated with theatre, especially lighting and set design. He turned to books to learn everything he could on the art. In junior high school and later at Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, he joined the stage squad and did the lighting and set design for plays. In high school he was encouraged by a wonderful teacher, Florence Druss, who understood immediately his aptitude for lighting design and encouraged him to pursue it as a career and to go on to college. In his junior year, his life’s plan was mapped out for him and he was accepted to Carnegie Tech, now Carnegie Mellon University. One year before graduating, there was a horrible accident and he lost one eye. He knew his great plans were in shambles because without depth perception, he thought it would be impossible to design lighting. However, his teacher and mentor came to the hospital and told him that no one would know he only had one eye, and he “would still be the best lighting designer ever.” The teacher saw the course the young man needed to be on, and convinced him to continue with his plans. With great sacrifice from his family, Fiorentino attended Carnegie Tech majoring in theatre.
After graduation, his plans to teach and design at Indiana State University the following fall were circumvented by the loss of his father and he undertook the new role as breadwinner for his family. He made the rounds at NBC, DuMont and ABC looking for immediate employment. When interviewed for a position with ABC, Fiorentino admitted he knew nothing about television lighting to which the interviewer replied, “So what? Nobody does.” Television was a new medium in 1950 and everything was a learning curve. Fiorentino recalls, “The man called back later and said, ‘I can hire you as a lighting director for television.’ I said, ‘Who's going to teach me?’ He said, ‘Nobody's going to teach you.’ I said, ‘Well, how will I know if it's right?’ He said, ‘If it looks good, remember how you did it.’ I started the next day.”
Career.
ABC Lighting Designer.
Fiorentino’s lighting career began during the “Golden Age” of television, when his TV credits included "Omnibus", "U.S. Steel Hour", "The Voice of Firestone", "Pulitzer Prize Playhouse", and the Bolshoi Ballet’s first televised appearance in the U.S. Broadcasts were still in black and white. There was no videotape or retakes. Everything was done “live.” Early television images required an intense amount of light in order for transmission of an image to appear on the screen and often employed banks of fluorescent lights. Coming from a theatre background, however, Fiorentino stayed away from the fluorescents and selected lighting instruments that would give a more modeled effect. Word got around quickly that his technique was artistic and directors began requesting his services. Fiorentino worked with such directors in those early years of television as Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Charles Dubin and Alex Segal. Lighting directors that worked on those early television programs invented lighting techniques as they went. For ten years Fiorentino worked as an ABC lighting designer as one of a small circle of lighting pioneers at other networks including Bob Barry and Greg Harney.
Imero Fiorentino Associates.
In 1960 Immie left ABC to form Imero Fiorentino Associates (IFA.) As the television industry expanded, Fiorentino foresaw the need of independent production companies producing much of the networks' content and their need for experienced lighting designers. Before long IFA became the go-to company for freelance lighting designers. Lighting designers from various networks came to work at IFA such as Fred McKinnon, George Reisenberger, Ken Palius, Leard Davis, William Knight, William Klages, Greg Brunton, Carl Vitelli, Richard Weiss, Carl Gibson, Stig Edgren, Tony DiGirolamo, Alan Adelman, Robert Dickinson, Vince Cilurzo, Jim Tetlow, Marilyn Lowey, John Conti, Jeff Calderon, and Jeff Engle. Over time the business expanded to provide both lighting and set design, production, staging and technical supervision for television and live events; everything from Broadway productions to political conventions, educational seminars to architectural lighting consultation.
Fiorentino actively participated in the artistic as well as company management, leadership and direction and took great pride in helping to guide the many unique projects that came through their doors.
Fiorentino's creativity was evidenced by his participation as leader of the IFA team serving as design and lighting consultants for fourteen Democratic and Republican National Conventions.
He led the team that designed the environmental lighting for the World Showcase Pavilions at Walt Disney World's Epcot in Orlando, Florida; the exhibition lighting and staging of the famous Howard Hughes Flying Boat "Spruce Goose" aircraft in Long Beach, CA.; Neil Diamond international concert tours and television specials for which he received two Emmy Award nominations; he also lit the legendary industrial show extravaganza (the granddaddy of corporate theater), "The Milliken Breakfast Show" for 21 years.
Fiorentino was also responsible for spearheading IFA's role as designers and consultants for many large television facilities around the country. He headed the IFA team that redesigned the lighting during the 1991 renovation of Madison Square Garden and designed the WaMu Theater housed in the Garden. 
Additionally, his credits include: "Frank Sinatra - The Main Event", televised live from Madison Square Garden, "El Cordobes: The Bullfight of the Century", transmitted live from Spain to 28 countries via satellite, the historic mass audience rock concert event, California Jam and the Broadway show, "The Night That Made America Famous". He has served as consultant to every U.S. President since Dwight D. Eisenhower, and to a multitude of major political candidates in television appearances and campaigns, as well as numerous Presidential Debates. He was hired to do the television lighting the day after the first Kennedy-Nixon debate where Nixon looked awful as the bright studio lighting exaggerated his jowls and sunken eyes. He lit the first-ever pictures that were transmitted to outer space and back to Earth via “Telstar 1” in 1962. Fiorentino and William Knight were the lighting designers for the historic "Barbra Streisand - A Happening in Central Park", Sept. 16, 1968.
Post-IFA.
In 1996, Caribiner International acquired IFA and Imero Fiorentino joined the global communications company as Senior Vice President. Caribiner was subsequently acquired by Jack Morton Worldwide where he continued in the same capacity. During the 2000 and 2008 political conventions, Fiorentino was the overall lighting designer for the Fox News coverage. In 2002, he entered the latest phase of his career as an independent lighting and production consultant. 
Family.
Fiorentino was married to Carole Hamer from 1953 to 1963 and they had one daughter, Linda. He married Angela Linsell, an artist, in 1970. His daughter Linda, a minister, is married to Ken Crabbs. They have a son, Christian Imero Fiorentino Crabbs.
Death.
He died in New York City on October 1, 2013.

Vatsa Bay

Vatsa Bay (Vazza) is a bay on the southern tip of Paliki peninsula of Kefalonia, Greece. This is an area that lies away from the main towns and villages in Kefalonia and preserves a rural charm for the visitor. There is no public transport, and access has to be by car.
History.
The bay of Vatsa was settled in Roman times. An mosaic with a trident and dolphins from a Roman villa is displayed at the Archeological Museum of Kefalonia. The Venetian used the bay as an shipyard.
Geography and economy.
The area has a low density of building. There are light agricultural activities, including covered growing houses. Fishing from small boats operates in the locality.
There is a tourist beach area.
The beach is approximately six metres wide and composed of red/yellow soft sand in which are embedded scattered pebbles.
A small river reaches the sea at this point on the coast (one of the two on Kepfalonia) and can be crossed by a chain-anchored boat.
Amenities.
The beach has a taverna (Spiaggia Taverna) immediately on the shore adjacent to the river. The Taverna has a thatched roof and the floor is of beach sand.

USS Kamishak (AVP-44)

USS "Kamishak" (AVP-44) was a proposed United States Navy seaplane tender that was never laid down.
Construction and commissioning.
"Kamishak" was to have been one of 41 "Barnegat"-class small seaplane tenders the U.S. Navy planned to commission during the early 1940s, and was to have been built at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. However, by the spring of 1943 the Navy deemed that number of seaplane tenders excess to requirements, and decided to complete four of them as motor torpedo boat tenders and one as a catapult training ship. In addition, the Navy also decided to cancel six of the "Barnegat"-class ships prior to their construction, freeing up the diesel engines that would have powered them for use in escort vessels and amphibious landing craft.
"Kamishak" became one of the first four ships to be cancelled when the Navy cancelled its contract with Lake Washington Shipyard for her construction on 22 April 1943.

Dublab

dublab is a non-profit music public broadcasting internet radio station based in Los Angeles. They have also been involved with art exhibition, film projects, event production, and record releases. Their broadcast is transmitted via Shoutcast, open formatted and live four days per week with two hour shows hosted by a collective of approximately 30 DJs. These Shows are archived and downloadable on the dublab website. Twice a year they broadcast live for two weeks to raise funds which is known as their Proton Drive.
Their name is a portmanteau of dubbing and laboratory for the combined meaning: a place of experimenting with sampling music. Examples of this, besides their stream, is their film production "Secondhand Sureshots" where they gave producers, such as Daedelus, five dollars to buy albums from thrift stores and sampling the music to create new tracks. Another in audio/visual form is "Into Infinity" a collaboration with Creative Commons. It is a group art exhibition of around a hundred vinyl record sized circular artworks and more than a hundred eight second audio loops. The works are randomly dubbed together and is all made freely available for others to remix and sample, even on the project's website.
In January 2008, "dublab" formed a non-profit umbrella corporation "Future Roots, Inc." The name comes from their characteristic style of mixing traditional music, such as folk, with electronic sounds. It also refers to the paradox that often music that is actually really old can sound very much like it was made in the present. In that theme, "dublab" will often only be written as either all lowercase or all uppercase by those familiar with the collective. There are other such characteristic writing styles such as a heavy use of alliteration.
Forty percent of dublab's funding is raised through a bi-annual, two-week long live broadcast fundraiser and the other 60% is generated through grants, Underwriting spots and event production. Their sound system and DJs have been featured at; MOCA, LACMA, Art Center College of Design, Barnsdall Art Park, CalArts, Page Museum/La Brea Tar Pits, The Getty Center, Disney Hall, UCLA, Hammer Museum, Hollywood Bowl, and El Rey Theatre.
They also have extended to releasing records such as; "In The Loop" series, "Summer", "Freeways", "Echo Expansion" and "Light from Los Angeles". They record many "Sprout Sessions" at their studio in Los Angeles, which are released freely as an audio RSS feed and Podcast. These have made their way to record releases such as the "Feathers Sprout Session". In August 2008 they released their performance video project called "Vision Version", which is available as an RSS feed. They also have music-themed group art shows such as "Into Infinity", "Dream Scene", "Up Our Sleeve", and "Patchwork".
"dublab" was founded in 1999 by Jonathan Buck, Mark McNeill and fellow students from KSCR Radio at the University of Southern California.

Shea Ralph

Shea Sydney Ralph (born 12 March 1978) is a former collegiate basketball player and current assistant coach for the University of Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team. Ralph was proficient in multiple sports, set state high school records in basketball, and earned multiple national player of the year awards in high school and college. She helped win a National Championship as a player at the University of Connecticut in 2000 and won numerous individual awards, including the Sports Illustrated for Women Player of the Year and the Honda Sports Award for the best collegiate female athlete in basketball. She suffered five ACL injuries in her career, two of which led to sitting out the 1997-98 season. Ralph was drafted by the WNBA Utah Starzz, but continued knee problems prevented her from embarking on a professional career. Ralph started her coaching career as an assistant coach at the University of Pittsburgh in 2003, then moved to the University of Connecticut in 2008.
High school.
Shea Ralph grew up in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where she attended Terry Sanford High School. She was named Athlete of the Year by the North Carolina High School Athletic Association. The Terry Sanford High School graduate is best known for her basketball prowess, but she also lettered in soccer, cross-country, and track. At the time of the award she held 17 state basketball records, including 39.1 points per game as a junior, a 71.6 percent shooting percentage from the floor as a junior, and 18 assists in one game. A scholar as well as an athlete, the National Honor Society member was a recipient of the 1995 Dial Award presented annually to the top male and female high-school athlete/scholar in the United States, earning a 4.2 grade point average on a scale of 4.0. Ralph was named a High School All-American by the WBCA. She participated in the WBCA High School All-America Game in 1996, scoring twelve points.
In 1996 she was named the USA Today National High School Player of the Year.
While in high school, Shea began a multi-year battle with anorexia nervosa. It began with an offhand comment by a teammate, telling her she looked a "little thick". She cut down her eating so significantly she dropped from 145 pounds to 108, a very low weight for a person. Her AAU coach, John Ellington, was concerned about her eating habits. One day at a post-game dinner he placed a hundred dollar bill next to a plate of mozzarella sticks and told her the money was hers if she would just eat the mozzarella. She turned him down. So he had to up the stakes, and told her to gain weight or she was off the team. The prospect of not playing basketball persuaded her to eat. Despite barely eating, she still managed to score 3002 points in her high school career.
College.
Ralph was the subject of a spirited recruiting battle, a natural consequence of her abilities leading to national high school player of the year honors. Many programs pursued her, but two schools appeared to have better chances than Connecticut. Ralph's mother, Marsha (Mann) Lake, was an All-American basketball player for the University of North Carolina. The North Carolina program was one of the better programs in the country. Ralph was growing up in North Carolina and her name was a "household word since she was eleven years old". Another premier program, the University of Tennessee, was also very interested in Ralph. The head coach of Tennessee, Pat Summitt, was good friends with Marsha, so many felt one of those two schools would have the inside track. 
Ralph called Geno Auriemma, the Connecticut coach, to ask what kind of role he envisioned for her at UConn. It is not uncommon for coaches to promise starting positions and a minimum number of minutes playing time for highly promising recruits. However, Auriemma responded, "I don't know. If you are really, really good, then you'll have a chance to play a lot. But if you suck, you won't play at all." Shortly thereafter, she made a recruiting visit to UConn, and told the coach she was ready to commit to Connecticut. She went on to have a great senior season in high school. After she earned the USA Player of the Year award, she was interviewed by "USA Today", who asked about her recruiting decision. She explained, "Coach Auriemma was the only coach that told me if I was really good I'd play a lot, and if I sucked I wasn't playing." Auriemma read the quote in the paper and "almost off his chair". He called her to say, "Geez, Shea. Did you have to say that in the paper?".
Ralph attended the University of Connecticut from 1996–2001, wearing uniform number 33, and graduating with a B.A. in Exercise physiology. She was enrolled at the university for five years, with a medical redshirt in her second year, 1997-98. During the four years she played a full or partial season, UConn had a record of 130-10. In Big East play, the team only lost two games in four seasons for a combined record of 66-2. Uconn won the Big East Regular season Championship and the post-season Big East Tournament Championship all four years. The Huskies went to the NCAA Tournament all four years, making the Sweet Sixteen each time, and the Final Four in her last two seasons. In 2000 Ralph captained the team to the National Championship and at the Final Four, was named the Tournaments Most Outstanding Player.
In her freshman year(1996–97) the UConn team won every game of their regular season schedule (27–0) and went on to win the Big East Tournament, completing an undefeated regular season with a 30–0 record. Ralph was named the Big East Rookie of the Year. She also earned national freshman of the year honors from both the United States Basketball Writers Association and The Sporting News. However, in the first round of the NCAA tournament, a game against Lehigh, Ralph tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her right knee. She was unable to play for the rest of the tournament. While the team was able to win their first three NCAA matches without Ralph, they lost to Tennessee in the regional final.
Shea had her best scoring year as a sophomore, with 16.7 points per game. She shot over 40% from beyond the three point arc for that season, and 51.7% during the Big East season, setting the all-time Big East record for three-point shooting in a season. In the Big East Tournament, her play earned her the Most Outstanding Performer award.
In her junior year (1999–00), she was named captain of the team that went on to win the national championship. In the Championship game against Tennessee, she scored 15 points on seven of eight shooting. She also had six steals and seven assists, prompting teammate Marci Czel to nickname her "Tournament Shea". She was named the Big East Player of the Year. Ralph also won national awards, including Sports Illustrated Women Player of the Year, the Honda Award in Basketball for best female collegiate athlete, and a spot on the Kodak All-America team. She played on the USA Basketball 2000 Jones Cup Team that won the Gold in Taipei.
In her senior year(2000–01), Ralph was named to the Big East First team. During her four years she wore number 33, worn previously by Jamelle Elliott, current UConn sports announcer Meghan Pattyson Culmo and subsequently by Barbara Turner.
Her final game was memorialized in Jeff Goldberg's book "Bird at the Buzzer", a game some have termed the "greatest women's basketball game ever played". After an excellent junior season, Ralph was less productive in the beginning of her senior season. The low point came in a game against Big East rival Notre Dame in January, a match-up between two undefeated teams ranked number one and number two in the country. (Goldberg p 66) (Walters 239). Ralph scored only two points in that game. The rematch between the two teams came in the Big East Championship game. Ralph started out on fire. At one point, she scored eight consecutive points for the Huskies to help them turn a deficit into a slim 31–28 lead. A few minutes later she scored again, pushing her scoring total to eleven points on 4–4 shooting, along with six assists and three steals with over six minutes remaining in the first half. However, on her next possession, she drove to the basket and took a shot, twisting to avoid her defender. Then, "an agonizing scream pierce the air" which prompted commentator Robin Roberts to cry "Shea Ralph, oh goodness, oh no", recognizing that Ralph had yet again torn an ACL. At halftime Ralph told her teammates that she had just "tweaked " it, and she would be back. UConn went on to win the game on a buzzer-beater by Sue Bird, but Ralph's college career was over. Nevertheless, Ralph's overall tournament production earned her a position on the All-tournament team.
Shea was a member of the inaugural class (2006) of inductees to the University of Connecticut women's basketball "Huskies of Honor" recognition program. She finished her college career with 1,678 points.
Shea's battle with anorexia continued in college. Her condition was not known to Connecticut at the time of her recruitment, but soon became apparent. Playing basketball was her first love, so benching her from playing did get her to eat. But that only lasted until her first ACL tear. Not able to exercise while rehabilitating, she worried about gaining weight and reverted to poor eating habits. A second ACL tear caused her to miss the entire 1997-1998 season. Even though the injury occurred in off-season, the news was significant enough that it was the lead story on the eleven o'clock news that evening in Connecticut. That year off convinced her that she needed to overcome her anorexia, if only out of responsibility to her teammates.
USA Basketball.
Ralph was named to the team representing the USA in 2000 at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team started strong with a 32 point win over the host team, the Republic of China National Team. They then beat South Korea easily and faced Japan in the third game. Japan started out strongly, and had an 18 point lead in the first half. The USA then out scored Japan 23–3 to take a small lead at the half. The USA built a ten point lead, but Japan cut it back to three with under a minute to go. Kelly Schumacher grabbed an offensive rebound and scored to bring the lead back to five points and the team held on for the win. Schumacher had 24 points to help the USA team beat Japan 83–80. The final game was against Malaysia, but it wasn't close, with the USA winning 79–24, to secure a 4–0 record for the competition and the gold medal. Ralph was the team's leading scorer, averaging twelve points per game
WNBA.
Shea Ralph was drafted in the third round (40th pick) by the Utah Starzz (now the San Antonio Silver Stars) She opted to sit out the first year so her knees could recover, but she never ended up playing in the WNBA.
Coaching career.
After finishing her college playing career and reaching the conclusion she would not be able to continue as a professional, Ralph joined the Hartford, Connecticut school system in 2002 to implement a "strength and conditioning program at the high school and middle school levels". She also planned to work on a "disease education and prevention program, focusing on diabetes". The position was not without controversy. Some felt that the salary paid was out of line with her education credentials.
However, Ralph decided to get back into basketball and joined the University of Pittsburgh the following year. The transition to a school without the winning tradition of UConn was difficult. After playing in only ten losing games in her four-year career, she joined a team that had a streak of eleven losses in eleven games heading into their final season game, which they also lost. Tensions mounted, and after strong words to some of the players, one left, leaving the team short-handed for a scrimmage. Ralph, despite five ACL surgeries, filled in and helped lead by example. The experience convinced her that she wanted to become a head coach, but she recognized she had a lot to learn. "I've learned how to take losing." she said, "That's about it."
Ralph remained at Pittsburgh for five years, helping to turn a team with a losing record into a nationally ranked team. When Tonya Cardoza left UConn to take the head coaching position at Temple University, the school needed a new assistant. Head coach Geno Auriemma called the head coach at Pittsburgh, Agnus Berenato, for permission to talk to Ralph. Berenato knew exactly why he had called and responded, "I hope you don't get what you are calling for." However, he did, and Ralph became an assistant at UConn in 2008.

De Sitter invariant special relativity

In mathematical physics, de Sitter invariant special relativity is the speculative idea that the fundamental symmetry group of spacetime is the indefinite orthogonal group SO(4,1), that of de Sitter space. In the standard theory of general relativity, de Sitter space is a highly symmetrical special vacuum solution, which requires a cosmological constant or the stress–energy of a constant scalar field to sustain. 
The idea of de Sitter invariant relativity is to require that the laws of physics are not fundamentally invariant under the Poincaré group of special relativity, but under the symmetry group of de Sitter space instead. With this assumption, empty space automatically has de Sitter symmetry, and what would normally be called the cosmological constant in general relativity becomes a fundamental dimensional parameter describing the symmetry structure of spacetime.
First proposed by Luigi Fantappiè in 1954, the theory remained obscure until it was rediscovered in 1968 by Henri Bacry and Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond. In 1972, Freeman Dyson popularized it as a hypothetical road by which mathematicians could have guessed part of the structure of general relativity before it was discovered. The discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe has led to a revival of interest in de Sitter invariant theories, in conjunction with other speculative proposals for new physics, like doubly special relativity.
Introduction.
De Sitter himself suggested that space-time curvature might not be due solely to gravity but he did not give any mathematical details of how this could be accomplished. In 1968 Henri Bacry and Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond showed that the de Sitter group was the most general group compatible with isotropy, homogeneity and boost invariance. Later, Freeman Dyson advocated this as an approach to making the mathematical structure of General Relativity more self-evident.
Minkowski's unification of space and time within special relativity replaces the Galilean group of Newtonian mechanics with the Lorentz group. This is called a unification of space and time because the Lorentz group is simple, while the Galilean group is a semi-direct product of rotations and Galilean boosts. This means that the Lorentz group mixes up space and time so that they cannot be disentangled, while the Galilean group treats time as a parameter with different units of measurement than space.
An analogous thing can be made to happen with the ordinary rotation group in three dimensions. If you imagine a nearly-flat world, one in which pancake-like creatures wander around on a pancake flat world, their conventional unit of height might be the micrometre formula_1, since that's how high typical structures are in their world, while their x and y axis could be the meter, because that's the size of their body. Such creatures would describe the basic symmetry structure of their world as SO(2), rotations in the x-y plane. Later on, they might discover rotations into the z axis— and in their every-day experience such rotations would always be by an infinitesimal angle, so that these z-rotations would commute with each other.
The rotations into the z-axis would tilt objects by an infinitesimal amount. The tilt in the x-z plane would be one parameter, and the tilt in the y-z plane another. The symmetry group of this pancake world is SO(2) semidirect product with R2, meaning that a two-dimensional rotation plus two extra parameters, the x-tilt and the y-tilt. The reason it is a semidirect product is that, when you rotate, the x-tilt and the y-tilt rotate into each other, since they form a vector and not two scalars. In this world, the difference in height between two objects at the same x, y would be a rotationally invariant quantity unrelated to length and width. The z coordinate is completely separate from x and y.
But eventually, experiments at large angles would convince the creatures that the actual symmetry of the world is SO(3). Then they would understand that z is really the same as x and y, since they can be mixed up by rotations. The SO(2) semidirect product R2 limit would be understood as the limit that the free parameter formula_2, the ratio of the height-unit formula_1 to the length-unit formula_4, approaches 0. The Lorentz group is analogous— it is a simple group that turns into the Galilean group when the unit of time is made long compared to the unit of space, which is the limit formula_5.
But the symmetry group of special relativity is not entirely simple because there are still translations. The Lorentz group are the transformations that keep the origin fixed, but translations are not included. The full Poincaré group is the semi-direct product of translations with the Lorentz group. But if you take the unification idea to its logical conclusion then not only are boosts non-commutative but translations should be non-commutative too.
In the pancake world, this would happen if the creatures were living on an enormous sphere, not a plane. In this case, when they wander around their sphere, they would eventually come to realize that translations are not entirely separate from rotations, because if they move around on the surface of a sphere, when they come back to where they started, they find that they have been rotated by the holonomy of parallel transport on the sphere. If the universe is the same everywhere (homogeneous) and there are no preferred directions (isotropic), then there are not many options for the symmetry group: they either live on a flat plane, or on a sphere with everywhere constant positive curvature, or on a Lobachevski plane with constant negative curvature. If they are not living on the plane, they can describe positions using dimensionless angles, the same parameters that describe rotations, so that translations and rotations are nominally unified.
In relativity, if translations mix up nontrivially with rotations, but the universe is still homogeneous and isotropic, the only options are that space-time has a uniform scalar curvature. If the curvature is positive, the analog of the sphere case for the two-dimensional creatures, the space-time is de Sitter and the symmetry group of spacetime is a de Sitter group rather than the Poincaré group.
De Sitter special relativity postulates that the empty space has de Sitter symmetry as a fundamental law of nature. This means that spacetime is slightly curved even in the absence of matter or energy. This residual curvature is caused by a positive cosmological constant formula_6 to be determined by observation. Due to the small magnitude of the constant, then special relativity with the Poincaré group is more than accurate enough for all practical purposes.
Modern proponents of this idea, such as S. Cacciatori, V. Gorini and A. Kamenshchik, have reinterpreted this theory as physics, not just mathematics. They believe that the acceleration of the expansion of the universe is not all due to vacuum energy, but at least partly due to the kinematics of the de Sitter group, which in their view is the correct symmetry group of space time, replacing the Lorentz group.
A modification of this idea allows formula_6 to change with time, so that inflation may come from the cosmological constant being larger near the big bang than nowadays. It can also be viewed as a different approach to the problem of quantum gravity.
High energy.
The Poincaré group generalizes the Galilean group for high–velocity kinematics, meaning that when all velocities are small the Lorentz group 'becomes' the Galilean group. (This can be made precise with İnönü and Wigner's concept of group contraction.) Similarly, the de Sitter group generalizes Poincaré for long distance kinematics, meaning that when magnitudes of all translations are small compared to the de Sitter radius, the de Sitter group becomes the Lorentz group. In quantum mechanics, short distances are probed by high energies, so that for energies larger than a very small cosmological scale, the Poincaré group is a good approximation to the de Sitter group.
In de Sitter relativity, the cosmological constant is no longer a free parameter of the same type, it is determined by the de Sitter radius, a fundamental quantity that determines the commutation relation of translation with rotations/boosts. This means that the theory of de Sitter relativity might be able to provide insight on the value of the cosmological constant, perhaps explaining the cosmic coincidence. Unfortunately, the de Sitter radius, which is interchangeable with the cosmological constant, is an adjustable parameter in de Sitter relativity, so the theory requires a separate condition to determine its value.
When a cosmological constant is viewed as a kinematic parameter, the definitions of energy and momentum must be changed from those of special relativity. These changes could modify significantly the physics of the early universe, if the cosmological constant was bigger back then. Some speculate that a high energy experiment could modify the local structure of spacetime from Minkowski space to de Sitter space with a large cosmological constant for a short period of time, and this might eventually be tested in the existing or planned colliders.
Doubly special relativity.
Since the de Sitter group naturally incorporates an invariant length–parameter, de Sitter relativity can be interpreted as an example of the so-called doubly special relativity. There is a fundamental difference, though: whereas in all doubly special relativity models the Lorentz symmetry is violated, in de Sitter relativity it remains as a physical symmetry. A drawback of the usual doubly special relativity models is that they are valid only at the energy scales where ordinary special relativity is supposed to break down, giving rise to a patchwork relativity. On the other hand, de Sitter relativity is found to be invariant under a simultaneous re-scaling of mass, energy and momentum, and is consequently valid at all energy scales. A relationship between doubly special relativity, de Sitter space and general relativity is described by Derek Wise. See also MacDowell-Mansouri action.
Newton–Hooke: de Sitter special relativity in the limit as v«c.
In the limit as v≪c, the de Sitter group contracts to the Newton–Hooke group. This implies that in the nonrelativistic limit, objects in de Sitter space have an extra "repulsion" from the origin, objects have a tendency to move away from the center with an outward pointing fictitious force proportional to their distance from the origin.
While this setup looks like it picks out a preferred point in space— the center of repulsion— it is more subtly isotropic. If you move to another point, you should transform to the uniformly accelerated frame of reference of an observer at this point, which changes all accelerations to shift the repulsion center to the new origin of coordinates.
What this means is that in a spacetime with non-vanishing curvature, gravity is modified from Newtonian gravity. At distances comparable to the radius of the space, objects feel an additional linear repulsion from the center of coordinates.
Quantum de Sitter special relativity.
There are quantized or quantum versions of de Sitter special relativity.

Block Drug

Block Drug Company was a pharmaceutical company based in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, that specialized in dental care products.
GlaxoSmithKline purchased the company for $1.24 billion in 2001.
Its most popular products included Polident denture cleanser, Poli-Grip denture adhesive, Dentu-Creme denture toothpaste, Nytol sleeping pill, Tegrin medicated shampoo for psoriasis, Lava hand soaps (acquired from Procter & Gamble), Beano and Phazyme anti-gas products, Balmex diaper rash ointments, and Sensodyne desensitizing toothpaste.
History.
The company was founded in 1907 by Alexander Block, a Russian immigrant who had a small drugstore on Fulton Street (Brooklyn) in Brooklyn, New York. He turned the company into a wholesaler in 1915 and then became a drug manufacturer in 1925, acquiring a 50 percent interest in Wernet's Dental Manufacturing Company.
Block Drug moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey in 1938.
Although Alexander Block built the company largely through acquisitions, he developed the Polident brand internally during the 1930s. In 1948, Block Drug rolled out the Ammi-i-Dent tooth powder, and in the early 1950s, the company developed Nytol. After Alexander Block's death in 1953, his son Leonard N. Block (1911–2005) took over, eventually becoming the company's chairman. The last major new product the company introduced was Tegrin, in 1964.
In 1971, the company went public, trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol BLOCA and raising $5.2 million in its initial offering. Two years later, another stock sale generated $23 million. Later in the 1970s, Efferdent took over from Polident as the No. 1 brand in its space.
In 1972, the company named as its president James Block, who was the grandson of Alexander Block and the nephew of Leonard N. Block. In 1988, James became chairman as his uncle, Leonard N. Block became senior chairman. At the same time, Leonard N. Block's son, Thomas, became the company's president.
In 1978, Block Drug entered the feminine hygiene market, with the ultimately unsuccessful Gentle Spring brand.
In 1983, Block Drug acquired the 2000 Flushes toilet bowl cleaner when it purchased the brand's manufacturer, Passaic, New Jersey-based Flushco. In 1985, Block Drug acquired the X-14 line of hard surface cleaners from White Laboratories. Block Drug later acquired Gold Bond in 1987.
By the 1990s, sales began to fall as Block Drug's products began to age and face new competition, and the problem was exacerbated by a lack of new products.
In 1990, Block Drug sold Gold Bond to Martin Himmel Inc..
In 1992, Block Drug acquired Phazyme from Thompson Medical Company.
In 1995, Block Drug divested its U.S. Reed and Carnrick Pharmaceuticals Division to Schwarz Pharma KermersUrban and also purchased Reckitt and Colman's Carpet Fresh and Rug Fresh cleaning and deodorizing products. Also, in late 1995, Block Drug acquired the Lava soap brand from Procter & Gamble.
In 1996, Block Drug purchased the Baby's Own line of baby care products, and then acquired Beano antigas tablets in 1997.
In 1998, a major restructuring took place but was not successful. As part of that, the company divested Carpet Fresh, Rug Fresh, 2000 Flushes and X-14.
In 2000, Block Drug hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser to evaluate a potential sale.
At the time of its sale to Glaxo, Block Drug was reported to have $900 million in annual sales, operations in 100 countries and employed 3,000 people.
Secrecy.
Although Block Drug was a public company from 1971 until 2001, it operated much like a private, family-run firm, with the Block family holding all voting shares plus 54 percent of the non-voting stock. In addition, the company never held annual meetings or issued proxy statements.
Aftermath.
Leonard N. Block died in 2005 at age 93 after suffering for years from Alzheimer's disease.

USS Matanzas (AVP-46)

USS "Matanzas" (AVP-46) was a proposed United States Navy seaplane tender that was never laid down.
Construction and commissioning.
"Matanzas" was to have been one of 41 "Barnegat"-class small seaplane tenders the U.S. Navy planned to commission during the early 1940s, and was to have been built at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. However, by the spring of 1943 the Navy deemed that number of seaplane tenders excess to requirements, and decided to complete four of them as motor torpedo boat tenders and one as a catapult training ship. In addition, the Navy also decided to cancel six of the "Barnegat"-class ships prior to their construction, freeing up the diesel engines that would have powered them for use in escort vessels and amphibious landing craft.
A contract with Lake Washington Shipyard for AVP-46's construction was let on 14 April 1942, and she was assigned the name "Magothy" on 23 August 1942. However, she became one of the final two ships to be cancelled when the Navy cancelled the contract on 29 April 1943 before construction could begin.

Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store, Inc 86 NW 2d 689 (Minn, 1957) is an American contract law case. It concerns the distinction between an offer and an invitation to treat.
Facts.
Great Minneapolis Surplus Store published an advertisement that said this.
On April 13, they published another advertisement in the same newspaper, as follows.
Mr. Lefkowitz was the first person to come on the Saturday after seeing the advertisement. He said he was ready to pay $1. But each time the store owner refused to sell, saying there was a "house rule" that it was for women only. The same advertisement was published the next week, and he arrived again. He was told that he knew the house rules and he would not get the coat.
Judgment.
Justice Murphy held that the advertisement constituted an offer, which could not be withdrawn. He described the facts and gave his decision as follows.

Franz Gebauer

Franz Gebauer (Hungarian: Gebauer Ferenc) (1888–1958) was an Austrian inventor and weapons designer, including an early power-operated machine gun which actually saw service use.
Biography.
Gebauer was born in 1888 in Gross-Herlitz, Austria. After finishing his schooling, he worked for a German car manufacturer, and later for Puch in Graz.
During World War I, he served in the Austro-Hungarian Air Force as a Waffenmeister at the Fischamend Military Airport.
Gebauer became a member of Danuvia RT's board of directors in 1926 and Technical Director in 1937. He fled to Sweden when the Soviets invaded Hungary in February 1945, where he worked for Bofors. He died in 1958.
Weapon designs.
During World War I the Schwarzlose MG M.07/12 was the standard machine gun for aircraft use. It was internally modified and air cooled to increase its firing rate to 700 rounds per minute, and normal practice was to use a pair of synchronized guns. However, although the Schwarzlose was an excellent infantry weapon on the ground, its use in aircraft had problems; at altitudes approaching the cartridge oiling system tended to freeze up, causing many failures during combat.
Gebauer concluded that the then-common practice of converting infantry machine guns for aircraft use was outdated. The most common problem with such converted weapons was that the position of the aircraft's propeller controlled the time of firing only, with the rest of the gun's operation depending on the force of propellant gases; a late-firing cartridge could cause damage to the propeller blades, while misfires stopped operation altogether. Gebauer had the idea to directly power a machine gun from the aircraft's engine, independently of the gas produced by the gun's cartridges. This meant that misfired cartridges would be automatically ejected and the next loaded. He called it the direct driven motor machine gun.
Gebauer Machine Gun 1918.M.
In 1917 Gebauer submitted his first twin-barreled motor driven machine gun design to his commanding officer and received approval to make prototypes. The first two were not successful, but the third improved design performed flawlessly on its trial in June 1918 at Aspern, near Vienna. The prototype was installed on an Aviatik D.II aircraft, flown by Colonel Benno Fiala.
The Gebauer 1918.M ("Gebauer Motorgéppuska 1918.M") weighed and could fire at a rate of 25 rounds per second, or 1500 rounds per minute, 4 times faster than the Schwarzlose, which could only achieve 6.25 rounds per second in similar conditions. The first 100 guns were ordered by the military in September 1918, the Solux Company of Vienna providing additional monetary support. The 100 guns were completed in October 1918, but the Armistice prevented actual combat testing.
Gebauer Machine Gun 1926/31.M.
After the end of World War I, Gebauer lived in Budapest, Hungary. In 1920 he worked unofficially for the Technical Experimental Weapon Division of the Hungarian Army, receiving funding from the military to continue improving his machine gun design in secret from Allied inspectors.
In 1922 a final prototype was created and designated 22.M GMP (Gebauer Motor Puska). From 1924 Gebauer started to work with the company Danuvia RT; the cooperation was to last for the next 20 years, Danuvia taking over funding and marketing. Gebauer became a member of Danuvia's board of directors in 1926 and Technical Director in 1937.
In 1926 Gebauer's latest improved model was approved by the Hungarian military, and manufacturing began. Between 1926 and 1934 243 guns were delivered to the Hungarian Air Force. The Air Force machine guns were designated 26/31.M GKM ("Gebauer Kényszermeghajtású Motorgéppuska", or "Gebauer Positive-Driven Motor-Machine Gun"); they were fixed twin-barrel guns driven from the aircraft engine's crankshaft. The GKM's drive had an automatic safety feature which disengaged a jammed barrel, while keeping its twin in operation. The guns were fed by 500-round belts and were chambered for the 7.92x57mm Mauser cartridge.
The GKM was used until 1942 on the Fiat CR-32 fighter, the IMAM Ro.37, the Heinkel He 46, and the WM-21 Solyom.
Gebauer GKM Machine Gun 1940.M.
This weapon was the same as the 1926/31.M, except it used the 12.7mm Italian Fiat-Safat cartridge. The gun was adopted in 1940 and was used on the Fiat CR-42 fighters which were supplied to Hungary by Italy in 1941-42. In 1943 Italy obtained a license to manufacture Gebauer machine guns in return for two Italian fighter planes, but it is unknown whether the Italians ever manufactured any Gebauers.
Gebauer Reconnaissance Machine Gun 1934.M.
This was a conventional gas-operated aircooled machine gun with a fixed barrel, designed for use on reconnaissance aircraft. The gun was fed from a 100-round "Horvath" drum magazine and was chambered for the 7.92x57mm Mauser cartridge. It saw service from 1934 to 1942 in the Hungarian Air Force. Operation and maintenance was much simpler than the earlier Schwarzlose machine guns.
Gebauer Tank Machine Gun 1934/37.M.
This gun (also called the 34.AM) was essentially identical to the 34.M, but was slightly modified for tank use, though retaining the 100-round drum magazine. It was chambered for the 8x56R 31.M cartridge. It was used in both single and twin mounts in the Fiat-Ansaldo M13/40 light tanks, Csaba armored vehicles, and Toldi light tanks. From 1942 it also saw use on gunboats and patrol boats, being used for airdefense and fitted with large round anti-aircraft sights.
Gebauer Tank Machine Gun 1934/40.M.
This gun was the same as the 34/37.M, but the drum magazine was replaced with a 100-round metal belt and a 41.M sight was fitted. These guns were used in the 40 M Turan I tanks and by the Flotilla for air defense. All captured Gebauer guns that were still serviceable were taken back to the USSR following the end of World War II.
Gebauer Semi-automatic rifle.
Existed only as prototype. Although it was a very good design and operated smoothly, it was turned down by the army officials, so that the soldiers would not waste ammunition by firing them too fast.

United States contract law

United States contract law regulates the obligations established by agreement (express or implied) between private parties in US law. The law varies from state to state; there is no nationwide Federal contract law, although transactions involving the sale of goods have become highly standardized nationwide through widespread adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code. There remains significant diversity in the interpretation of other kinds of contracts, depending upon the extent to which a given state has codified its common law of contracts or adopted portions of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.
Parties are permitted to agree to arbitrate disputes arising from their contracts. Under the Federal Arbitration Act (which has been interpreted to cover all contracts arising under federal or state law), arbitration clauses are generally enforceable unless the party resisting arbitration can show unconscionability or fraud or something else which undermines the entire contract.
Formation.
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties creating reciprocal obligations enforceable at law. The elements of a contract are mutual assent, consideration, legally competent parties and legal purpose.
Agreement.
Mutual assent is also known as ratification and meeting of the minds is typically established through the process of offer and acceptance. However, contracts can also be "implied in fact", as discussed below. At common law, the terms of a purported acceptance must be the "mirror image" of the terms of the offer. Any variation thereof constitutes a counteroffer.
An offer is a display of willingness by a promissor to be legally bound by terms they specify, made in a way that would lead a reasonable person in the promisee's position to understand that an acceptance is being sought and, if made, results in an enforceable contract. Ordinarily, an offeror is permitted to revoke their offer at any time prior to a valid acceptance. This is partially due to the maxim that an offeror is the "master of his offer."
In the case of options, the general rule stated above applies even when the offeror promises to hold the offer open for a certain period of time. For example, Alice says to Bob, "I'll sell you my watch for $10, and you can have a week to decide." Alice is free to revoke her offer during the week, as long as Bob has not accepted the offer.
However, if the offeree gives some "separate" consideration (discussed below) to keep the offer open for a certain period of time, the offeror is not permitted to revoke during that period. For example, Alice offers to sell Bob her watch for $10. Bob gives Alice $1 to keep the offer open for a week. Alice is not permitted to revoke during the week.
A counteroffer is a new offer that varies the terms of the original offer. Therefore, it is simultaneously a rejection of the original offer. For example, Alan says to Betty, "I'll sell you my watch for $10." At this point Betty has the power of acceptance. But Betty responds, "I'll only pay $8." Betty's response is a rejection of Alan's offer but gives Alan a new power of acceptance. It is possible to phrase what appears to be a counteroffer so that it does not destroy the original power of acceptance. For example, Alan says to Betty, "I'll sell you my watch for $10." Betty responds, "I wonder whether you would take $8." Betty retains her original power of acceptance (unless Alan revokes), but she does not give Alan a new power of acceptance, as she is not making an offer of her own. Therefore, she is not making a counteroffer either. As such, mere inquiries are not counteroffers.
An acceptance is an agreement, by express act or implied from conduct, to the terms of an offer, including the prescribed manner of acceptance, so that an enforceable contract is formed. In what is known as a battle of the forms, when the process of offer and acceptance is not followed, it is still possible to have an enforceable contract, as mentioned above with respect to contracts implied in fact.
The Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") dispenses with the mirror image rule in § 2-207. UCC § 2-207(1) provides that a "definite and seasonable "expression" of acceptance...operates as" an acceptance, even though it varies the terms of the original offer. Such an expression is typically interpreted as an acceptance when it purports to accept and agrees on the following terms of the original offer: subject matter, quantity, and price. However, such an expression is not interpreted as an acceptance if it is "expressly conditional" on the original offeror's assent to the varied terms, discussed below. This language is known as the "proviso". When the proviso is not used, the terms of the contract are determined by subsection 2. When the proviso is used, but there is no assent by the original offeror to the offeree's varied terms, yet the parties go ahead and perform (act like they have a contract, hence a contract implied in fact), the terms of the contract are determined by subsection 3. So, the terms of a contract under 2-207 are never determined by a combination of subsections 2 and 3.
UCC § 2-207(2) of the statute tells what to do with "additional" terms. It does not explicitly address what to do with "different" terms. A minority of states, led by California, infer that this was a typographical error by the drafters. As such, those states treat different terms in the same manner as additional terms. The majority rule, however, is that different terms do not become part of the contract; rather, both of the conflicting terms--from both parties--are removed from the contract. This is known as the "knockout rule". Any "gaps" resulting from the removal of these terms are "filled" by Article 2's "gap-fillers." 
A term in a purported acceptance is "different" if it directly contradicts the subject matter of a term present in the original offer. A term in a purported acceptance is "additional" if it contemplates a subject matter not present at all in the original offer. As already mentioned, subsection 2 "does" tell what to do with additional terms. They do "not" become part of the contract if either party is "not" a merchant.
A merchant is defined elsewhere in the UCC as a party that regularly "deals in goods of the kind" or otherwise gives an impression of knowledge or skill regarding the subject matter of the transaction. If "both" parties are merchants then additional terms in a purported acceptance "do" become part of the contract unless any of three exceptions apply.
The exceptions are (out of order): objection by the original offeror in advance; objection by the original offeror within a reasonable time after notice; and material alteration of the contract. The third exception, whether the additional terms materially alter the contract, is the most difficult to apply. Typically, to show it, the merchant must be subjected to undue hardship and/or surprise as a result of the varied term, as measured by the industry involved. It is well established that disclaimer of warranty, indemnification, and arbitration are all clauses that do constitute material alterations.
UCC § 2-207(3) only applies when the proviso language from subsection 1 is used. When the proviso is used, there is no contract formed at that time unless the original offeror assents to the terms that the party purporting to accept has made "expressly conditional."
For example, a buyer sends a purchase order with its own terms. The seller sends an acknowledgement with additional and/or different terms and uses the proviso. The buyer must accept the seller's additional and/or different terms, or else no contract is formed at that time.
Frequently, however, the buyer in such a situation does "not" accept the seller's terms, typically through silence, that is, not signing and returning the form to the seller. Subsection 3 is designed to deal with this situation.
When the parties begin to perform the contract, they form a contract implied in fact. The terms of that contract are determined by this subsection. They consist of those terms both forms agree on. Any pertinent term upon the forms do not agree are not part of the contract but instead are supplied by the Code's "gap fillers".
Note that whether the parties are merchants is irrelevant for this subsection. However, private parties do not typically send and receive purchase orders or invoices, so in hypotheticals, the parties typically are merchants.
For example, the Brown Company (buyer) sends a purchase order to the Smith Company (seller) for 100 widgets. Brown's terms are silent as to arbitration. Smith sends an acknowledgement, making its acceptance of Brown's offer "expressly conditional" on Brown's assent to Smith's additional term that any dispute arising from the transaction be resolved by arbitration. Brown does not sign and return Smith's form, but Smith goes ahead and fulfills the order. Brown receives the widgets and pays for them. The forms do not agree as to the term of arbitration. Therefore, if a dispute arises, the arbitration clause is not part of the contract. Instead, a UCC gap-filling provision is used. Since the Code does not supply arbitration, Brown is able to avoid Smith's term and bring an action in court.
Consideration and estoppel.
Consideration is something of value given by a promissor to a promisee in exchange for something of value given to a promisee to a promissor. Typical examples of things of value are acts, forbearances, and/or promises to do so. The latter referring to those things that a party has a legal privilege to do in the first place. So, promising to refrain from committing a tort or crime is not a thing of value for purposes of consideration. This is known as the bargain theory of consideration and requires that the promises to exchange the things be reciprocally induced. This is especially important for the discussion of past consideration, below.
Consideration must be "sufficient", but courts do not weigh the "adequacy" of consideration, partially because in a capitalistic society private parties are entitled and expected to determine the value of things for themselves. In other words, the things being exchanged must have "some" value in the eyes of the law, but the general rule is that courts do not care "how much". Love and affection, for example, would not constitute sufficient consideration, but a penny would. However, sufficient consideration that is grossly inadequate may be deemed unconscionable, discussed below.
Moreover, things that ordinarily constitute sufficient consideration may be deemed insufficient when they are being exchanged for "fungible" things. For example, $1 is ordinarily sufficient consideration, and $100 is ordinarily sufficient consideration. However, if Alan and Betty agree to exchange $1 for $100, it would not be an enforceable contract for lack of consideration. An exception to this exception is when there is special significance to the $1 bill itself, such as if it was the first dollar a person made in business and carries tremendous sentimental value, similar to the peppercorn rule. Fungible things do not have to be money, though. They can be grains stored in a silo, for example. One bushel of grain being exchanged for 100 bushels of the same grain would not be sufficient consideration.
Past acts cannot constitute consideration. For example, an employer lays off an employee but promises to give him a pension in exchange for his long and faithful service to the company. It is impossible for the employee to presently promise to have worked all those years for the pension. He worked for the paychecks that the company promised in the past, not knowing whether a pension lay in the future. He might have hoped to one day receive a pension, but the company did not promise one until his layoff. Note, in this situation, the employee may be able to prevail on a claim of promissory restitution, but there is no contract for lack of consideration.
Promissory estoppel is a separate cause of action to breach of contract, requiring separate elements to be shown. It has the effect that in many contract like situations, the requirement of consideration need not be present. The elements of promissory estoppel are:
Formality.
Ordinarily, contracts do not have to be in writing to be enforceable. However, certain types of contracts do have to be reduced to writing to be enforceable, to prevent frauds and perjuries, hence the name statute of frauds, which also makes it not a misnomer (fraud need not be present to implicate the statute of frauds). Typically the following types of contracts implicate the statute of frauds:
For example, a two-year employment contract naturally cannot be performed within one year. Interestingly, in many states lifetime contracts are not considered to fall within the Statute of Frauds reasoning that life can end at any time, certainly within one year from the time of execution. In other states, notably Illinois, contracts requiring performance for a lifetime are covered by the Statute.
The statute of frauds requires the signature of the party against whom enforcement is sought (the party to be sued for failure to perform). For example, Bob contracts with the Smith Company for two years of employment. The employer would need to sign the writing.
Moreover, the writing for purposes of satisfying the statute of frauds does not need to be the actual contract. It might be a letter, memorializing and formalizing an oral arrangement already made over the phone. Therefore, the signed writing does not need to contain all of the terms that the parties agreed to. At common law, only the essential terms were required in the signed writing. Under the UCC, the only term that must be present in the writing is the quantity. The writing also does not need to be one document, but if there are multiple documents, they must all obviously refer to the same transaction, and they all must be signed. The signature itself does not need to be a full name. Any mark made with the intent to authenticate the writing is satisfactory, such as initials or even such as an X by an illiterate party.
No writing is required when:
The last exception applies up to the quantity admitted, which may include the entire contract. This reversed the rule at common law that permitted a defendant to testify that he indeed contracted with the plaintiff but refuses to perform because it is not in writing.
Breach of contract.
Damages.
The primary remedy for breach of contract is expectation damages, or "benefit of the bargain." At law, this is monetary compensation. At equity, it can be specific performance or an injunction, among other things. For example, Dan and Pam have an enforceable contract for the sale of Dan's watch. The price they agreed to was $10. The actual value of the watch is $15. Pam would be able to successfully pursue a claim for $5. She might elect this route if she did not want to keep the watch but sell it to a third party for a profit. Alternatively, Pam could successfully pursue a claim whereby the court would order Dan to sell the watch for the original price. She might elect this route if she actually wanted the watch for herself.
The remedy for quasi-contracts (contracts implied in law) is quantum meruit, the reasonable or "fair market" value of goods or services rendered. The remedy for promissory estoppel is reliance damages.
Arbitration.
Parties are permitted to agree to arbitrate disputes arising from their contracts. Under the Federal Arbitration Act (which has been interpreted to cover all contracts arising under federal or state law), arbitration clauses are generally enforceable unless the party resisting arbitration can show unconscionability, fraud or something else that undermines the entire contract.
Quasi-contract.
The terms quasi-contract and contract implied in law are synonymous. There are two types of quasi-contract. One is an action in restitution. The other is unjust enrichment. Note, therefore, that it is improper to say that quasi-contract, implied in law contract, and unjust enrichment are all synonymous, because unjust enrichment is only one type of the broader category of quasi-contracts (contracts implied in law).
Contracts implied in law differ from contracts implied in fact in that contracts implied in law are not true contracts. Contracts implied in fact are ones that the parties involved presumably intended. In contracts implied in law, one party may have been completely unwilling to participate, as shown below, especially for an action in restitution. There has been no mutual assent, in other words, but public policy essentially requires a remedy.
Restitution.
The full name of this cause of action is "restitution for actions required to preserve another’s life or health." It is available when a party supplies goods or services to someone else, even though the recipient is unaware or does not consent. Unawareness and non-consent can both be due to unconsciousness, but the latter also includes incapacity, which in turn refers to mental incompetence and/or infancy (minority).
The elements of this cause of action are:
Unjust Enrichment.

Vigor Brown

John Vigor Brown (18 June 1854 – 2 September 1942), known as Vigor Brown, was a New Zealand Member of Parliament for Napier, in the North Island. He was Mayor of Napier for a total of 18 years. He was a well-known figure in his adopted city, a successful businessman, and involved in many clubs and organisations.
Early life.
Brown was born in London in 1854. For his parents, Jessie Gilmour and John Brown, it was their third boy and last child. Both parents had Scottish ancestry. His father worked for a bank, and was later a commercial traveller. The family briefly lived in France before emigrating to Victoria, Australia. John Vigor Brown, his brothers and their mother arrived in Melbourne on 22 January 1862 on the "Water Nymph". It is assumed that his father was already there. They made their home in South Yarra. He was educated at Melbourne Church of England Grammar School.
Professional career.
Brown learned the trade of a wholesale merchant (clothing) at the firm Sargood, King and Sargood in Melbourne. He came to Wellington in 1875. For two years, he worked for the Wellington firm of A. P. Stewart and Company as a travelling sales person. His next employment brought him to Napier, where he remained for the rest of his life. He became branch manager for Archibald Clark and Sons, an importing company. He resigned from that position in May 1898 and took on the management of Neal and Close, where he was managing director at a later point. He formed his own company, J. Vigor Brown and Co. He was further managing director of White Swan Brewery, and Hawke's Bay Soap and Tannery. He was a director of the Napier Gas Company. He was the local agent for the United and Phoenix Fire Insurance Companies.
Local body politics.
He was voted onto the both the Napier Harbour Board and the Napier Borough Council in 1898. He was chairman of the Harbour Board from February 1904 until April 1911. He was a member of the Chamber of Commerce.
He was elected Mayor of Napier in April 1907. He was mayor for three periods: 1907–1917, 1919–1921 and 1927–1933. The 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake fell into Brown's last period, and temporary governance arrangement included a Napier Citizens' Control Committee, followed by a two-man Government Commission. J. S. Barton and L. B. Campbell were farewelled by the mayor in May 1933, when their term ended and the municipal affairs once again rested with the borough council. The resulting mayoral election was contested by the incumbent and C O Morse, the chairman of the Earthquake Relief Committee. The election caused great interest, and Morse and Brown received 4110 and 1808 votes, respectively. At the time, mayoral elections were held every two years, but the 1931 election had been skipped due to the earthquake. While mayor Brown was involved in the new Hawke's Bay Rugby League and helped them secure access to McLean Park in 1911.
Member of Parliament.
The Napier electorate had been held since the 1899 election by Alfred Fraser. Fraser stood again in the 1908 election, but although he was with the Liberal Party, Brown also contested the electorate as a Liberal. Brown won the contest with a majority of 1035 votes (3803 votes to 2768).
In the 1911 election, Brown was challenged by H. T. Hill. Both men were supporters of the current Liberal government. Brown and Hill received 3858 and 2825 votes, respectively.
Brown served in the New Zealand House of Representatives for fourteen years from 1908 to 1922. Wilson notes that Brown was an Independent Liberal.
Family.
Brown married Caroline Balaclava Cook, daughter of the late John Cook of Auckland, on 27 November 1880 at St John's Church in Napier. They had four daughters and two sons before Caroline died from peritonitis on 6 September 1891 at the young age of 36. He remarried on 19 September 1894 to Violet McConechie Bogle. There were no further children from this second marriage.
In 1910, Brown had a 31' launch built for the family, named "Water Nymph" after the ship used for his emigration to Victoria during his childhood.
His second wife predeceased him on 23 February 1924. Brown died on 2 September 1942 in Napier, where he had lived since 1877. After his death, his family took on the surname Vigor-Brown.

Bow Hut

The Bow Hut is an alpine hut located at an elevation of on the eastern edge of the Wapta Icefield in Banff National Park. It is the largest, best equipped, and most accessible of the four alpine huts on the Wapta Icefield, and serves as the base for a wide variety of ski tours and mountaineering ascents to half a dozen peaks on the Wapta. It is the easiest and safest starting point for the Wapta traverse; and Balfour Hut, the next hut on the traverse, can easily be reached from it in a day. It can also serve as an intermediate stop in a longer traverse which starts at the less easily accessible Peyto Hut. The hut is maintained by the Alpine Club of Canada.
The hut sleeps 30 and is equipped with propane powered lamps and stovetop, and a wood stove for heating. There are two indoor drum toilets.
History.
The original Bow Hut was built in 1968 by a group led by Peter Fuhrmann, who later became president of the Alpine Club of Canada from 1984 to 1988, and was funded by Peter and Catharine Whyte. The construction was done mostly by members of the Alpine Club and the Calgary Ski Club. The location of the hut, near Bow Glacier, was chosen to assist ski tourers and mountaineers entering the Wapta Icefield via Bow Lake. The old hut saw severe overuse, with up to 7,000 people a year using a building that only slept 14 people at a time. By the 1980s it was in a state of serious disrepair and surrounded by contamination from the outhouses, causing many people to refer to it as "Bow Ghetto". In 1989 a new hut was built under the direction of Mike Mortimer, Chairman of the Huts Committee of the Alpine Club of Canada and later President from 1994 to 2001. Money for the facility was primarily provided by the Calgary and Edmonton Sections of the Alpine Club. The new facility is much larger than the previous one, with much better cooking, and waste disposal facilities; and with sleeping areas separated from the rest of the hut to accommodate a number of different groups at a time.
Location.
Bow Hut is located near the headwaters of the Bow River, about northwest of Lake Louise, Alberta along the Icefields Parkway in Banff National Park. The hut is situated above Bow Lake on the east edge of the Wapta Icefield, at an altitude of . It is about 1 kilometre northeast of Saint Nicholas Peak.
Access.
Reaching the hut requires approximately 3 to 6 hours of hiking or skiing from the Icefields Parkway. The hut can also be reached by approximately 3 to 5 hours of glacier travel from the Balfour Hut, or 4 to 6 hours of glacier travel from the Peyto Hut.
Summer.
The summer trail to Bow Hut leaves from the main parking lot on the highway at Bow Lake. It goes past Num-Ti-Jah Lodge and follows the north shore of the lake around to the main creek that feeds the lake. The trail ascends to the right of the canyon just upstream from the lake. At a junction it goes to the left, and crosses the creek, passing over a boulder lodged in the top of the canyon. The trail stays on the east side of the creek for a few kilometres until it opens out into moraine terrain near the treeline. A number of trails marked by cairns lead to the massive headwall below the hut, where hikers must cross the creek and can follow any of a number of trails up the steep slope to the hut. The trip requires 3 to 6 hours.
Winter.
The winter route is a little different than the summer trail, and involves exposure to complex avalanche terrain. Skiers can cross the frozen lake, if the ice is thick enough, and at the far side can stay to the left of the creek, following a good trail that skirts the canyon. After about the route drops down onto the creek bed and follows it through a gorge. After the gorge becomes too difficult to negotiate, skiers must ascend the bank to the left at one of the easier points, and then angle up through the trees, parallel to the canyon. When the route reaches an open basin, it is possible to see the hut high up on the headwall to the right. From that point, skiers should aim for the right-hand corner of the headwall, staying left initially to avoid the worst of the moraine. Toward the end of the valley, a number of possible routes lead up through the headwall to the hut, which is a few hundred metres from the top of the headwall. The trip normally takes 3 to 5 hours.

Emergency Severity Index

The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a five-level emergency department (ED) triage algorithm that provides clinically relevant stratification of patients into five groups from 1 (most urgent) to 5 (least urgent) on the basis of acuity and resource needs. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funded initial work on the ESI. The ESI differs from the standardized triage algorithms used in several other countries, like the Australasian Triage Scale, in being based on identifying interventions required instead of a permissible wait time. ESI category 1 patients require "immediate life-saving interventions", like mechanical ventilation, control of major bleeding, and cardioversion.

Drag Me to Hell

Drag Me to Hell is a 2009 American horror film co-written and directed by Sam Raimi. The plot, written with his brother Ivan, focuses on loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), who tries to impress her boss by refusing to extend a loan to a gypsy woman by the name of Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver). In retaliation, Ganush places a curse on Christine that, after three days of escalating torment, will plunge her into the depths of Hell to burn for eternity. The film also stars Justin Long of "Alvin and the Chipmunks" fame
Raimi wrote "Drag Me to Hell" with his brother, Ivan, prior to working on the "Spider-Man" films. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and was released to wide critical acclaim. It was also a box office success, making $90.8 million worldwide on a $30 million budget. And after strong DVD sales of $13.9 million in its first year, its total was accumulated more than $104 million. "Drag Me to Hell" won the award for Best Horror Film at the 2009 Scream Awards and the 2010 Saturn Awards.
Plot.
In 1969 in Pasadena, California, a couple seeks the aid of the medium Shaun San Dena (Flor de Maria Chahua) saying their son (Shiloh Selassie) has been hearing evil spirits' voices after stealing a silver necklace from gypsies. San Dena aids the family by carrying out a seance, but they are attacked by an unseen force that pulls the boy into Hell. The medium says she will encounter the force again one day.
In present day Los Angeles, bank loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) hopes to be promoted to assistant manager over her co-worker Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee). Her boss, Jim Jacks (David Paymer), advises her to demonstrate that she can make tough decisions to get a promotion. Christine is visited by an elderly woman, Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver), who asks for an extension on her mortgage payment. Christine, though empathetic with the old woman's crisis, decides to deny Ganush an extension to prove herself to her boss. Ganush begs Christine not to repossess her house and kneels in front of her, but Christine gets scared from the woman's bizarre pleading as she is helping her to stand up and calls the security, who take Ganush away while Ganush blames Christine for "shaming" her. Jim compliments Christine on how she handled the situation.
When the working day is over and Christine goes to the bank parking garage to head home, Ganush attacks Christine in her car, rips a button off Christine's coat and uses it to place a curse on her as revenge. Later, Christine and her boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long) meet the fortune teller Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) who, after seeing multiple demonic faces, tells Christine that she is being haunted by a spirit. At her home, Christine is attacked by the spirit and has nightmares about Ganush. At work the next day, Christine snaps at Stu and has a projectile nosebleed that soaks her boss in blood. She runs away and Stu is seen secretly taking a file off Christine's desk.
Christine then goes to talk to Ganush at her soon-to-be-taken home, only to find that she died the previous night and a wake is being held. Christine returns to Rham Jas, who explains that as long as Christine is the owner of an accursed object (her button), she will be haunted by a powerful demon called the Lamia (not to be confused with the Greek child-eating demon) that will torment her for three days before taking her to Hell. He suggests a sacrifice to appease the demon. The next day, the Lamia returns and thrashes Christine in her bedroom. Desperate to stop the attacks, Christine sacrifices her pet kitten, an act that leaves her heart-broken. At a dinner party with Clay and his parents, she is again tormented by the Lamia, but this time through the use of illusions, which frightens the Daltons.
Christine returns to Rham Jas for further help. He says that Shaun San Dena (Adriana Barraza) will risk her life to stop the demon for a fee of $10,000. Further supernatural attacks on Christine lead Clay to pay the fee. San Dena prepares a seance to trap the Lamia's spirit in a goat and kill it to vanquish the spirit. San Dena allows the Lamia to inhabit her body. Rham Jas tries to persuade it not to steal Christine's soul, but it refuses and vows never to stop until Christine dies. Christine then places San Dena's hand on the goat, causing the spirit to enter its body. San Dena's assistant, Milos, attempts to kill the goat, but is instead bitten by the goat and in turn becomes possessed, attacking the members of the seance. San Dena banishes the Lamia from the seance, but dies in the process. Christine thinks the medium has overcome the Lamia, but Rham Jas explains that she only managed to drive the spirit away until the next day, when it will come back for Christine. Then he seals the cursed button in an envelope and tells Christine that before the next day comes, she can get rid of the curse by giving the button to someone as a gift, thereby passing the curse on to that person.
After being driven home by Clay, who doesn't know what actually happened at the seance, Christine attempts to find a recipient for the curse. She decides to give the envelope to Stu in revenge for his stealing her work, but changes her mind after seeing how pathetic, tearful and panicky Stu is when he meets her. With guidance from Rham Jas, Christine learns that she can give it to Ganush even though she is dead because "the soul never dies". Christine drives to the cemetery where she is buried and digs up her grave. In a torrential downpour, Christine jams the envelope in Ganush's mouth in anger and gets out of the grave just in time before dawn.
Christine then returns home. Preparing to meet Clay at Los Angeles Union Station from where they plan to depart for a weekend in Santa Barbara, she gets a phone message from her boss telling her that she landed her dream position after Stu confessed to stealing her work and was fired. At the station, Christine also buys a coat that she has been eyeing for a long time, as a sign of a new beginning. Clay, planning to propose, reveals to Christine that he found the envelope containing the cursed button in his car. Christine then realizes she mixed up her envelope with another that she gave to Clay when she accidentally dropped it. Horrified, Christine backs away and falls onto the tracks. As a train barrels towards her, fiery hands burst from the ground under the tracks. Clay can only watch in horror as Christine is dragged down into the fiery abyss of Hell, and is left holding Christine's cursed button.
Production.
Background.
The original story for "Drag Me to Hell" was written ten years before the film went into production and was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan Raimi. The film went into production under the name "The Curse". Sam and Ivan Raimi wrote the script as a morality tale, desiring to write a story about a character who wants to be a good person, but makes a sinful choice out of greed for her own betterment and pays the price for it. Sam and Ivan tried to make the character of Christine the main focal point in the film, and tried to have Christine in almost all the scenes in the film. Elements of the film's story are drawn from the British horror film "Night of the Demon" such as the similar-shaped demons and the three day curse theme in the film. The most significant parallel is that both stories involve the passing of a cursed object, which has to be passed to someone else, or its possessor will be devoured by one or more demons. Raimi wanted the film to be, unlike his past horror films, rated PG-13 and not strictly driven by gore, stating, "I didn't want to do exactly the same thing I had done before."
After finishing the script, Raimi desired to make the picture after the first draft of the script was completed, but other projects such as the "Spider-Man" film series became a nearly decade-long endeavor, pushing opportunities to continue work on "Drag Me to Hell" to late 2007. Raimi offered director Edgar Wright to direct "Drag Me to Hell" which Wright turned down as he was filming "Hot Fuzz" and felt that "If I did it, it would just feel like karaoke." After the previous three "Spider-Man" films, Raimi came back to the script of "Drag Me to Hell", wanting to make a simpler and lower-budget film. In 2007, Sam Raimi's friend and producer Rob Tapert of Ghost House Pictures had the company sign on to finance the film. Universal Studios agreed to distribute domestically.
Casting.
After completing the script and having the project greenlit, Sam Raimi started casting the film. Ellen Page was originally cast for the main role of Christine, but dropped out of the project due to SAG strike-related scheduling issues. The main role eventually went to Lohman, who didn't enjoy horror films, but enjoyed doing the stunts during filming. Stage actress Lorna Raver auditioned for the role of Mrs. Ganush. Raver was not aware of the specific nature of her character until being cast, stating that all she had read was "about a little old lady coming into the bank because they're closing down her house. It was only later that I saw the whole script and said, 'Oh my!'" To prepare for this role, Raver met with a Hungarian dialect coach and asked to have portions of the script translated into Hungarian. Raimi would later ask Raver to use some of the Hungarian words in the scenes of Ganush's attacking Christine. Dileep Rao, who plays Rham Jas, made producer Grant Curtis mildly hesitant in casting him, stating that during his audition "he was a little bit younger than he read in the script. But as we were looking at his reading, Sam said, 'There's no minimum age requirement on wisdom.' Dileep has that wisdom and presence on screen, and that’s what made him right. Once he got on camera, he brought that shoulder for Alison to lean on." Many of the actors playing secondary characters in "Drag Me to Hell" have appeared previously in Raimi's films, including Joanne Baron, Tom Carey, Molly Cheek, Aimee Miles, John Paxton, Ted Raimi, Bill E. Rogers, Chelcie Ross, and Octavia Spencer.
Filming.
Sam Raimi said he set out to create “a horror film with lots of wild moments and lots of suspense and big shocks that’ll hopefully make audiences jump. But I also wanted to have a lot of dark humor sprinkled throughout. I spent the last decade doing "Spider-Man" and you come to rely on a lot of people doing things for you and a lot of help, but it’s refreshing and wonderful to be reminded that, as with most filmmakers, the best way to do it is yourself, with a tight team doing the main jobs."
Production for "Drag Me to Hell" began on location in Tarzana, California. The production team included director of photography Peter Deming ("Evil Dead 2", ""), production designer Steve Saklad ("Juno"), and visual effects supervisor Bruce Jones. The film was produced by Grant Curtis and Rob Tapert. Tapert and Raimi are longtime collaborators, having attended college together in Michigan.
Editing.
"Drag Me to Hell" was edited by Bob Murawski, who has collaborated with Sam Raimi on several films including the "Spider-Man" series, "The Gift", and "Army of Darkness".
Raimi has said of working with Murawski on "Drag Me to Hell", "He’d come (down to the set) to see how things were going and to let me know if he’d just cut something that wasn’t working the way he’d wanted it to, or to suggest a pick-up shot I should get for a piece he felt we needed in a sequence I hadn’t realized I needed. He’s very detail-oriented... So we’re very close collaborators."
Raimi finds editing with Murawski to be "relaxing", adding, "I love it. For me, it's so relaxing, unlike pre-production, which is fraught with anxiety and fear about how we'e going to do things, and production, which is so rushed and a sleepless time and you're just racing to finish every shot and worrying about focus and so on. So post is soothing and I can watch the film come together, so it's a time of discovery for me as Bob and I fit all the pieces together. I see new possibilities in post, as Bob puts the film together, sometimes in a way I never imagined..."
The film was edited by Murawski on an Avid computer system in a West Los Angeles facility. The color grading was completed at Company 3 with colorist Stephen Nakamura. Nakamura used a "da Vinci Resolve." It was CO3's first start-to-finish feature in 4K resolution.
"For us, post is a very creative time where it's not just about this factory producing the blueprinted product. It's really a very creative, experimental time where we try and take everything that's been written and then shot to the next level," said Raimi.
The final sound mix was completed at the Dub Stage in Burbank with mixers Marti Humphrey and Chris Jacobson.
Effects.
The effects in "Drag Me to Hell" were created in many different ways, including green screen, puppets, prosthetics and computer-generated imagery. Bruce Jones was the visual effects supervisor on the film. Of Jones, Raimi commented, "He brought a great can-do approach to the film... He's got a great team of artists and technicians with him, and he's got great instincts.”
There were hundreds of visual effects in the film, and different effects houses were utilized. According to Raimi, the Bay Area's Tippett Studio was a big player. "We also had work done by Amalgamated Pixels, Ghost VFX, KNB Effects, Home Digital, Cinesoup and IE Effects," said Raimi. According to Raimi, “Bob (Murawski) and I kept adding visual effects as post proceeded. In this film, the supernatural, the unseen, is almost another character, so sequences were developed — even in post — that would suggest the presence of the supernatural, and we kept on adding. The same with the sound effects, so it was a very ongoing, very live process in post."
Director of photography Peter Deming tried to use realistic lighting in the film. Said Deming, "Normally, you'd put all corrected bulbs in, but we went with what was there, including the shots in the street. We used the streetlight look and mixed that with interior lighting. There were a lot of odd color sources that we chose to leave the way they would be naturally. It's a heightened sense of realism." One of the earliest projects the special effects teams did was the scene in which Mrs. Ganush attacks Christine in her car. To film the action, which included close-ups of Christine jamming her foot on the pedal, hitting the brake, and shifting gears, the team created a puzzle car which allowed the front engine compartment and back trunk — as well as all four sides and doors — to come away from the car. The roof came off in two directions.
Reception.
"Drag Me to Hell" was first shown to the public as a "Work in Progress" print at the South by Southwest festival on March 15, 2009. The film debuted in its full form at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, where it was shown out of competition on May 21 as a midnight screening.
Box office.
The film was released in American theaters on Friday May 29, 2009. The film opened at #4 with $15,825,480 from 2,900 screens at 2,508 theaters, for an average of $6,310 per theater ($5,457 average per screen). In its second weekend, it dropped 56 percent, falling to #7, with $7,040,550 from 2,800 screens at 2,510 theaters, for an average of $2,805 per theater ($2,514 average per screen), and bringing the 10-day gross to $28,233,230. "Drag Me to Hell" closed on Thursday, August 6, 2009, with a final gross in the United States and Canada of $42,100,625, and an additional $48,742,021 internationally for a total of $90,842,646 worldwide.
Critical reception.
"Drag Me to Hell" was acclaimed by critics upon release. Rotten Tomatoes rated the film as "Certified Fresh", with 92% of critics giving the film a positive review, based upon a sample of 227 reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 32 reviews, signifying "universal acclaim".
Positive critical reception of the movie generally praised the film's scary but humorous and campy tone. Owen Gleiberman of "Entertainment Weekly" gave the film an A rating, stating that "Raimi has made the most crazy, fun, and terrifying horror movie in years." Betsy Sharkey of the "Los Angeles Times" praised the film, stating that it "should not be dismissed as yet another horror flick just for teens. The filmmakers have given us a 10-story winding staircase of psychological tension that is making very small circles near the end." Michael Phillips of the "Chicago Tribune" described the film as a "hellaciously effective B-movie comes with a handy moral tucked inside its scares, laughs and Raimi's specialty, the scare/laugh hybrid." Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun Times" gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and stated that the film "is a sometimes funny and often startling horror movie. That is what it wants to be, and that is what it is." In a positive review, "Variety" said of the film: "Scant and barren of subtext, the pic is single-mindedly devoted to pushing the audience's buttons... Still, there's no denying it delivers far more than competing PG-13 thrillers."
Bloody Disgusting gave the film four and a half stars out of five, with the review calling it "quite simply the most PERFECT horror film I've seen in a long, long while... a blast and moved quickly from start to finish [and is well on its way to becoming an immediate classic." The film was then ranked thirteenth in Bloody Disgusting's list of the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade'.
Kyle Smith of the "New York Post" thought it was cheesy, with too many "gross-outs", Rex Reed of the "New York Observer" thought that the plot wasn't believable enough, and Peter Howell of "The Toronto Star" disliked Lohman's performance and thought it was "just not very funny". The movie was nominated for "Choice Movie: Horror/Thriller" at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards, which the film lost to "Friday the 13th" (2009). At the 2009 Scream Awards show, "Drag Me to Hell" won the awards for Best Horror Movie and Best Scream-play.
Reviews have also received the movie as a comedy horror in a more classic Raimi vein. Vic Holtreman of "Screenrant" claims the film is a long-awaited movie that combines both genres as "Army of Darkness" had done. A reviewer at UGO Networks says that the movie is very much more a comedy than horror and that this is in keeping with Raimi not having produced a "true horror" film since he began directing.
Home media.
"Drag Me to Hell" was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the US on October 13, 2009. Both media include an Unrated Director's Cut as well as the Theatrical Version. In its first two weeks the DVD sold 459,217 copies generating $7.98 million in sales. It since accumulated $13.9 million in DVD sales, bringing its total to $104,822,032
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack for "Drag Me to Hell" was composed by Christopher Young. Young has worked with director Sam Raimi previously on his films "The Gift" and "Spider-Man 3". The soundtrack was released on August 18, 2009. Sam Raimi stated that emphasis was on using the soundtrack to create a world that didn't exist, a world of the "supernatural". The score contains elements of Young's previous work on "Flowers in the Attic". This is particularly apparent in the utilization of the ethereal childlike soprano vocals that feature prominently throughout the soundtrack.

Also involved is Kanna Mori as Natsumi Hikari, and Renji Ishibashi as Natsumi's grandfather Eijiro Hikari. Another member of the cast is Tatsuhito Okuda as the mysterious Narutaki. The World of "Kamen Rider Kuuga", as well as most of the other Rider Worlds, sport several characters that have been renamed and cast with different actors. Ryouta Murai has been cast as Yusuke Onodera who is the series' version of Kuuga. Rounding up the cast is Kimito Totani who portrays as the thief Daiki Kaito/Kamen Rider Diend.
Synopsis.
The story revolves around the nine parallel universes of the previous Heisei Kamen Riders merging into one, something that would destroy all the worlds. To prevent this, Tsukasa Kadoya transforms into Kamen Rider Decade and is told that to save his own world he must travel with Natsumi and her grandfather to the other Kamen Riders' Worlds called A.R. Worlds (Another Rider's World or Alternate Reality World) and defeat the other Kamen Riders. Along the way, confronting the mysterious Narutaki and the thief Daiki Kaito, they are joined by Yusuke Onodera of the World of Kuuga and Kivala of the World of Kiva.
To fit with the printing motif of the series, the main Kamen Riders of the series follow the CMYK color model: Decade is magenta, Diend is cyan, and Kuuga (Rising Ultimate Form) is black and yellow. In the "" film "Episode Yellow: Treasure de End Pirates", Diend is the primary character, emphasizing the yellow accents on his Diendriver and the enhanced Kamen Ride Diend card.

However, Kamen Rider Kuuga survived the initial battle, assuming Ultimate Form to confront Decade once again with the two seemingly destroying each other in the ensuing battle. As Narutaki explains to Natsumi, the dream is a predestined event in which Decade will destroy all the worlds.
Episodes.
Generally, episodes of "Decade" are titled similarly to the episodes of the series that they reference. "Kamen Rider Kuuga"s episodes were titled with only two kanji and episodes of "Kamen Rider Kiva" have a musical reference and musical notation in the title. For the World of Hibiki story arc, the episode title cards are stylized in calligraphy similar to the styles featured in "Kamen Rider Hibiki". For the World of Amazon story arc, the episode title had a reference from "Kamen Rider Amazon" episode 3. An episode arc also features a crossover with "Samurai Sentai Shinkenger".
In an interview in the March 2009 issue of "Kindai" Magazine, Masahiro Inoue stated that "Decade" was slated as having only 30 episodes. A subsequent interview in "Otonafami" magazine confirmed that only 30 episodes were filmed, with 31 episodes airing total.

Voice actor Katsumi Shiono provides vocal effects for the Phylloxera Worm, as he often does for "Kamen Rider" monsters. Popular TV Asahi announcer Yoko Ooshita also makes an appearance in "Kamen Rider G" as herself.
The original characters for "Kamen Rider G" are all wine-themed.

His Rider Kick finisher is also wine-based, as it is called the . The letter "G" in the title is taken to either meaning "Good", referring to the actor Goro Inagaki, or as an onomatopoeia of the sound of wine being poured out of a bottle (). The antagonist of the piece is a Worm called the ; the phylloxera fly is a grapevine pest. The Phylloxera Worm would later be used as the antagonist for the "Kamen Rider Kabuto" episodes of "Decade".
Within the small production, a terrorist organization known as takes over the TV Asahi studios in Tokyo. The group led by Daidō Oda (Yusuke Kamiji) demands that that the Japanese government release their leader Seizan Tokugawa (Show Aikawa), who was arrested after the group's human experimentations came to light. The Shade cell is assisted by the brainwashed Goro (SMAP's Goro Inagaki), but when he sees that his girlfriend Eri Hinata (Yumiko Shaku) is amongst the hostages, he regains his memories and turns on the Shade terrorists. Oda is forced to reveal himself as the Phylloxera Worm, and reveals that several other Shade members have been converted into Worms. Goro transforms into Kamen Rider G to take on the Worms, defeating them all save for Phylloxera who is much too strong for him. Just then, Kamen Rider Decade and the other Heisei Kamen Riders appear to give Kamen Rider G the confidence he needs to destroy the Phylloxera Worm with his Swirling Rider Kick. As the Phylloxera Worm says in his last breath that the war is not over, Goro reunites with Eri before proclaiming he will protect the world from Shade's evil influence.

Nunobiki Dam

Nunobiki Dam is a dam in Kobe, in Hyōgo Prefecture of Japan. It is the first concrete gravity dam in Japan. It is situated in Chuo-ku, Kobe, at the foot of the mountain stream Nunohiki and waterfall of the same name. In 2006 with the modernization of water resources and water supply, the dam was designated as important heritage site.
History.
The modern water supply plan in Japan was originally drawn up in 1887 but in 1892, Professor William Barton from the British Ministry of Engineering proposed an earth-fill dam with a reservoir capacity of about 31 million tons. Construction began in 1897 and it was completed in 1900. In 2005, the dam was partly reconstructed to incorporate seismic strengthening and sediment dredging was completed.

R.J. Ritchie Hut

The R.J. Ritchie Hut (Balfour Hut) is an alpine hut located at an altitude of between the southern tip of the Wapta Icefield and the northern tip of the Waputik Icefield in Banff National Park. The hut is at the half-way mark for the Wapta traverse and is usually used in conjunction with the other huts in this chain while attempting a cross-glacier ski trip. The hut is maintained by the Alpine Club of Canada.
The hut sleeps 18 in the summer and 16 in the winter. It is equipped with propane-powered lamps and stovetop, a wood stove for heat, and an outdoor composting toilet.
The hut requires approximately three to five hours of glacier travel to get to from the Bow Hut, or six to eight hours from the Scott Duncan Hut.
Location.
The hut is found on low, rocky hills at the toe of the Vulture Glacier. It is east of Balfour Pass and the continental divide, just inside the boundary of Banff National Park.
History.
The original Balfour Hut, a fibreglass igloo built in 1965 at Balfour Pass in Banff National Park, was the first hut on the Wapta Icefield. Construction was undertaken by the Alpine Club of Canada and the Calgary Ski Club. It survived until 1971, having being disassembled and reassembled entirely with Swiss Army Knives, airlifted by helicopter, and inadvertently dropped onto a glacial moraine. Eventually, marauding bands of wolverines destroyed it.
The second Balfour Hut was constructed in 1971 of cedar logs on the south side of Mount Olive to the west of the continental divide in Yoho National Park. It lasted for 18 years.
In 1989, the current metal hut was built at a new location in Banff National Park: the toe of the Vulture Glacier.

Hart Day Leavitt

Hart Day Leavitt (1909–2008) was a longtime English teacher at Phillips Andover Academy, amateur jazz musician, the author of a bestselling book on grammar and writing, and the professor of many notable Andover graduates, including Jack Lemmon, H. G. Bissinger and President George H. W. Bush.
A native of Concord, New Hampshire, where his father, Congregational minister Ashley Day Leavitt, was pastor of a church, Leavitt was born December 29, 1909. Ironically, he attended Andover's archrival, nearby Phillips Exeter Academy, and subsequently graduated from Yale University, his father's alma mater, in 1934. Following his Yale graduation, Leavitt studied at the Bread Loaf school at Middlebury College. 
Soon afterwards, Leavitt took a $22-a-week job as a cub reporter on a New Hampshire newspaper. During his time as a reporter, the mother of Leavitt's fiancée suggested that he read "And Gladly Teach", a book by Perry Bliss, brother of Phillips Exeter's principal. The book so captivated Leavitt that he immediately presented himself at the office of the Exeter principal, where he asked for a job. But with no graduate degrees, he was rejected.
Leavitt next turned to the competition: Phillips Andover in Andover, Massachusetts, where headmaster Claude M. Fuess was intrigued by the thought of hiring a graduate of his archrival. "I was a bit disappointed not to go back to my old school," Leavitt said years later, "but not for long." Leavitt joined the Massachusetts preparatory school's English department, where he taught for nearly 40 years.
During his time at Andover, Leavitt authored three books about creative writing, including "Stop, Look, and Write", which became a bestseller with over a million copies in print. He also indulged his first love, jazz, by playing sax and clarinet in several jazz ensembles. At age 14 Leavitt received a saxophone from his father, and he played through Exeter and Yale, and at one time considered a career as a musician. "At one point," the teacher recalled, "I thought I'd make jazz my profession."
But when Leavitt joined the Andover faculty, jazz was somewhat outré. "Back in the 1940s the school was run by old conservatives, most of whom thought jazz was evil music", Leavitt later told musician and Andover graduate Thomas Chapin, recalling an invitation by some of his students to play with their band. "So I decided to go in and ask the headmaster who hired me if it would be all right to perform with the boys and their band. The boss looked at me disapprovingly. 'Well, Hart if you want to do "that kind of thing!"' So I had to refuse."
In his faculty role on the Andover campus, Leavitt wore several hats, including five years coaching the varsity hockey team (1945–50). The team normally played on Rabbit Pond as an ice hockey rink had not yet been built. Following his stint as a coach, Leavitt switched gears, and embracing his love of carpentry and theater, headed up the stage crew at the old George Washington Hall theater. In his one on-stage performance, the English teacher appeared as one of the gangsters in "Kiss Me, Kate", crooning "Brush Up Your Shakespeare" in a thick gangster accent.
Leavitt often joked with colleagues about his education at rival Exeter. A handful of other Andover faculty were also Exeter graduates, and the group referred to themselves as "the red cell" among the blue. (Exeter's school colors are maroon and white; Andover's blue and white.) "For this teenager it all began," said Andover alum and fellow teacher of English Thomas Regan, "with the mystery of how an Exonian could develop such lifelong loyalty to Andover."
Former President George H. W. Bush told "Time" magazine in an interview that he recalled writing several book reviews for Leavitt's English class, including one for "Moby Dick". Bush received a grade of 67 in the class. (A grade of 60 was a failing grade).
About his former student Leavitt was circumspect, recalling that "his grades in my course were not very good. He was in my eleventh-grade English class, but my remaining impression is that he just sat in the class and handed in his papers." Leavitt recalled having "very little respect for George's mentality." But, Leavitt allowed, "I have to go back and say that when he was in my class maybe he was an underdeveloped young man like a lot of them."
"He showed no imagination or originality", Leavitt told "Time", although he added that Bush was pleasant and had good manners. Leavitt also taught George's brother, Prescott Bush Jr., and noted that the Bush brothers' Senator father was too self-possessed to engage in small talk.
Nearing the end of his Andover career, a former student recalled Leavitt as "on the verge of retirement and still playing regular saxophone gigs with a big band." Following his retirement from Phillips Andover at age 65, Leavitt was appointed to the faculty of Harvard University, where he taught expository writing to freshmen for five years. At the end of his Harvard stint, and again facing retirement, Leavitt got himself appointed to a job teaching English at Tufts University.
Leavitt was married to Carol for 63 years. Among their shared interests were music – she loved classical, and he loved jazz. His wife encouraged Leavitt to take up the clarinet, and he dragged her to smoky jazz clubs to listen to his favorite jazz artists, including Ella Fitzgerald. Together they were instrumental in bringing the Andover Chamber Music Series to the town.
Hart Day Leavitt died October 10, 2008, in North Andover, Massachusetts. A memorial service was held at Kemper Auditorium at Phillips Andover on November 15.

Aldeburgh Branch Line

The Aldeburgh Branch Line was a railway branch line between Saxmundham railway station on the East Suffolk Line and the seaside town at Aldeburgh. There were intermediate stops at Leiston railway station and Thorpeness railway station. It is currently used for nuclear flask trains servicing Sizewell nuclear power station.
Early history.
The line opened as far as Leiston on 1 June 1859 and was extended to Aldeburgh railway station on 12 April 1860. 
The line was proposed by Samuel Morton Peto and supported by local agricultural machine manufacturer Richard Garrett. The Leiston Works Railway operated to link the line to Garrett's Leiston Works. Operated initially by the Eastern Counties Railway it was taken over by the Great Eastern Railway in 1862. 
The line described.
Most trains started their journey at Saxmundham railway station and travelled half a mile northwards along the East Suffolk Line to Saxmundham Junction where the Aldeburgh branch diverged eastwards across fields towards Leiston. The line climbs sharply over a ridge of higher ground before falling gently towards the coast. The first station is Leiston (4.5 miles) which as well as goods sidings served the Richard Garrett & Sons works. 16 chains east of the station was a siding on the north side of the line which originally served the town gasworks but was later in service as a coal siding until the 1960s.
There was another industrial siding at Sizewell which was originally provided for cattle traffic off the local marshes . and this location is the present day terminus of the line. It is believed this siding was opened in 1860. Thorpeness station (6.5 miles) was a single platform affair and in latter year its station buildings consisted of three former carriage bodies supported by concrete sleepers at the back. 
The three carriages were recorded as:
There was a siding provided here from 1921 for goods traffic.
The terminus of the line at Aldeburgh consisted of a single platform with an attractive overall roof - quite an unusual feature for the Great Eastern. The station building was a two storey affair. There was a small goods shed as well as a small engine shed at this location. There was a local inn called the Railway Inn close to the station site that still exists today.
Passenger train services.
In April 1860 there were 5 trains each way between Aldeburgh and Saxmundham.
In October 1921 there were 8 services each way two of which were shown as mixed.
In 1922 there were direct services to Aldeburgh from London Liverpool Street Station (journey time 3 hours 33 minutes). These consisted of a carriage(s) dropped off the Lowestoft express services and operated between 1906 and 1939. 
In the Winter 1951/2 timetable there were six trains per day each way.
In the September 1964 timetable there were seven trains each way with three through trains to Ipswich one of which continued to Colchester (Mondays - Fridays only). In the opposite direction only one service originated at Ipswich. No Sunday services.
The final 1965/66 timetable showed seven trains each way.
The final passenger train was worked over the branch by British Rail Metro-Cammell diesel multiple units numbers 79066 and 79282. Driver Skeels from Ipswich engine shed was at the controls. The event was filmed.
In September 2011, Suffolk County Council investigated the possibility of running train services between Saxmundham and Leiston Stations using a Parry People Mover light railcar.
In connection with the construction of Sizewell C train operator DRS were in June 2012 considering passenger services to serve the power station. Whether this will mean the re-opening of Leiston station or a new station is unclear.
Freight train services.
Initial freight services would have included agricultural produce and coal. Up until 1914 there was a good trade in fish but when Aldeburgh harbour became blocked by shingle banks this traffic ceased. 
From the lines opening the Garrett's establishment was responsible for significant freight traffic which lasted until the 1960s. Indeed the goods yard there was still open in 1972 when it was recorded as handling military traffic.
During the 1920s a concrete factory existed at Thorpeness and was served by the siding.
Building material for both Sizewell A in the 1960s and Sizewell B power stations between 1987 and 1990 was bought in by rail. 
Nuclear trains are the only regular source of traffic on the branch today and these are operated by Direct Rail Services who have a depot at nearby Stowmarket.
On 18 October 2010 the British government announced that Sizewell was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. If so the Aldeburgh branch may see construction traffic return.
Locomotives.
Locomotives known to have worked the branch include:
These locomotives would have most likely been allocated to Ipswich engine shed and it is possible that other smaller classes of engine from that depot would have worked the line. As mentioned Aldeburgh had a small engine shed which was a sub-shed of Ipswich and used to stable the branch locomotive overnight.
In the diesel era the following locomotives worked freight services:
Ipswich shed was one of the first depots to convert to diesel only power and as a result operation of passenger services passed to Diesel Multiple Units based at Norwich. DMU types that are known to have worked the branch include:

Dance India Dance

Dance India Dance is an Indian dance competition show that airs on Zee TV in the India, produced by UTV Software Communications and has become India's largest dance-based reality show. The show is the national TV version of the hit Zee Bangla dance reality show "Dance Bangla Dance" which also has Mithun Chakraborty as the Grandmaster.
The show first premiered on January 30, 2009, was created by "Zee TV" producers . The first season was hosted by Tarana Raja; since then second season it has been hosted by Indian television personality Saumya Tandon with Jay Bhanushali. The show features a format where dancers from a variety of styles enter open auditions held in Indian Metropolitan cities to showcase their unique style and talents and, if allowed to move forward, then are put through "Mega-audition" rounds of auditions to test their ability to adapt to different styles. At the end of Mega Audition, Only Top 18 dancers are chosen as 'finalists' who move on to compete in the competition's main phase where they will perform solo, duet and group dance numbers in a variety of styles in competition for the votes of the broadcast viewing audience which, combined with the input of a panel of judges, determines which dancers will advance to the next stage from week to week.
The show features a variety of Indian cultural and international dance styles ranging across a broad spectrum of classical, contemporary, Bollywood, hip-hop, jazz, Kalaripayattu, Salsa, Samba and musical theatre styles, amongst others, with many sub-genres within these categories represented. Competitors attempt to master these styles in an attempt to survive successive weeks of elimination and win a cash prize (typically Rs 50 Lakh) and often other awards, as well as the title of "India's Best Dancer". The show is choreographed by some of the most popular Indian choreographers, such as Terence Lewis, Remo D'Souza and Geeta Kapoor. The show has won several Television Awards for "Most Popular Dance Reality Show".
Show Format.
The show gathers raw talent aged 15 to 25 from all over India. Once chosen, the contestants are trained by professional Bollywood choreographers. Thereafter the participants compete against each other. Some of the dance forms that are taught to the contestants are ballet, acrobatics, shadow dancing, mid-air dancing, Broadway theatre, contemporary, Bollywood, Latin, ballroom, and hip-hop.

Selection of finalists.
The selection process can be further broken down into two distinct stages: the open auditions and a second phase referred to as the 'Mega Auditions'. The open auditions take place in 5–6 major Indian cities and are typically open to anyone aged 15–30 at the time of their audition. The cities in which auditions are held varies from season to season but some, such as New Delhi and Mumbai, have featured in almost every season. During this stage, dancers perform a brief routine (typically individually) before a panel of dance experts. This panel will then make an on-the-spot decision as to whether the dancer demonstrated enough ability . If the dancer impressed the Judges with his/her dancing abilities, judges will award a "Dancing Superstar ki Topi" (Hat of Dancing Superstar), moving them instantly one step forward in the competition.
The second stage of the selection process, the "Mega Auditions", is a several-day-long process in which the remaining hopefuls are tested for overall well-rounded dance ability, stamina, and their ability to perform under pressure. The dancers are put through a battery of rounds which test their ability to pick up various dance styles (typically some of the more well-represented genres that will later be prominent in the competition phase, such as Hip-Hop, Bollywood Dance, Jazz, Bharat Natyam, Kathak, Mohiniyattam, Odissi and Contemporary). At the end of this process, only Top 18 competitors will be chosen. then, Those Top 18 got divided into 3 groups of dancers named, Terence Ki Toli, Geeta Ki Gang and Remo Ke Rangeeley. Each Group containing 6 Dancers, then compete in the show with learning new skills throughout the Journey .

Incontinence (philosophy)

Incontinence ("a want of continence or self-restraint") is often used by philosophers to translate the Greek term Akrasia (ἀκρασία). 
Used to refer to a lacking in moderation or self-control, especially related to sexual desire' incontinence may also be called wantonness.
Aristotle.
Aristotle devoted book VII of the Nicomachean Ethics to the discussion of continence and incontinence, having previously linked the latter both to prodigality in its effects, and to those dominated by irrational feeling in its failure to obey knowledge of the good: a case of knowing virtue, but not having habituated it to control passion. 
Aristotle considered one could be incontinent with respect to money or temper or glory, but that its core relation was to bodily enjoyment. Its causes could be weakness of will, or an impetuous refusal to think. At the same time, he did not consider it a vice, because not a product of moral choice but of a failure to act on one's better knowledge.
Later developments.
For Augustine, incontinence was not so much a problem of knowledge (knowing but not acting) but of will: he considered it a matter of everyday experience that men incontinently chose lesser over greater goods.
In Dante's Inferno incontinence manifests itself as "a Leopard, nimble and light and fleet", representing the self-indulgent sins of the first circles of hell. The mutual incontinence of lust was for Dante the lightest of the deadly sins, even if its lack of self-control would open the road to deeper layers of Hell.
Akrasia would thereafter appear as a character in Spenser's The Faerie Queene, representing the incontinence of lust, followed in the next canto by a study of that of anger; and as late as Jane Austen the sensibility of such figures as Marianne Dashwood would be treated as a form of (spiritual) incontinence.
With the triumph of Romanticism, however, the incontinent choice of feeling over reason became increasingly valorised in Western culture. Blake wrote that "those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained". Encouraged by Rousseau, there was a rise of what Arnold J. Toynbee would describe as "an "abandon" (ακρατεια)...a state of mind in which antinomianism is accepted – consciously or unconsciously, in theory or in practice – as a substitute for creativeness".
A peak of such acrasia was perhaps reached in the 1960s cult of letting it all hang out – of breakdown, acting out and emotional self-indulgence and drama. Partly in reaction, the proponents of emotional intelligence would look back to Aristotle in the search for impulse control and delayed gratification – to his dictum that "a person is called continent ot incontinent according as his reason is or is not in control". 
Arguably, however, irrationality continues to play a major part in what have been seen as the incontinent voices of postmodern discourse.

John P. Roberts

John P. Roberts (1945 – October 27, 2001) was a businessman who bankrolled the Woodstock Festival.
After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Roberts and his friend Joel Rosenman tried to pitch a story for a television series about entrepreneurs who had more money than ideas. Each week their antics would get them into a new series of problems.
Roberts and Rosenman had met at a golf course in 1966 and shared an apartment in 1967.
To do research they placed an advertisement in "The Wall Street Journal" identifying themselves as "young men with unlimited capital" who were looking for business ideas. Among the 5,000 responding were Michael Lang and Artie Kornfeld who proposed building a recording studio in Woodstock, New York to encourage recordings by local residents Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and The Band. Eventually this idea was dropped in favour of staging an outdoor music festival.
As they developed a plan it was clear there was no area around Woodstock that would meet their requirements, they then moved it to Wallkill, New York. Following protests from local residents they moved to its eventual location in Bethel, New York.
The concert cost between $2.4 million and $3.1 million to produce and brought in $1.8 million from gate receipts. While the producers would make money on the movie and soundtrack of the events, Roberts said he would not get out of debt from the event until 1980.
After the concert they produced subsequent events of the same type and operated a leveraged buyout firm in Manhattan.

USS Hempstead (APA-241)

The second proposed USS "Hempstead" (AVP-43) was a United States Navy attack transport that was never laid down.
"Hempstead" was to have been a "Haskell"-class attack transport, attack transports differing from conventional transports in being specifically designed to unload their troops and cargo over the side into boats, less efficient for hauling troops and cargo but far more efficient for unloading them in an amphibious landing. The "Haskell" class was based on a redesigend version of the civilian Victory Ship hull.
"Hempstead" was excess to requirements after the end of World War II, and the Maritime Commission contract with Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation, Portland, Oregon, for her construction was cancelled on 27 August 1947 before construction began.

Mayorship.
Russell was re-elected on April 6, 2010, for a second term and resigned on April 20, 2010.
On April 14, 2010, it was reported by a local newspaper that Russell had announced that she was running for the position of County Clerk of Chaffee County in Colorado in 2010.
Attempted removal by Trustees.
On October 29, 2008, Russell wrote a column for the "Chaffee County Times" entitled: "How big a payoff do you want?" that outlined both the advantages and disadvantages of an annexation ballot question. Several Town Trustees believed the vote to annex the Cottonwood Meadows development was lost by a mere 21 votes because of the Mayor's letter giving both the advantages and disadvantages of the real estate development. 
The column prompted five of the six Town Trustees to present her with a letter of dismissal on November 10, 2008. Two weeks later, after the Trustees determined that this was not the best course of action, having been informed by the Mayor's attorney that they could be in violation of the mayor's First Amendment rights and subject to criminal charges, they voted to withdraw the letter of dismissal.
On April 16, 2010, Russell filed a Federal lawsuit against the Town of Buena Vista and five Town Trustees for violation of her First Amendment rights. On July 9, 2010, "The Mountain Mail" newspaper reported that the Trustees denied the allegations and contended that they were, under legal doctrines, immune from the lawsuit. They also contended Russell's public statements opposing the annexation were not protected by the First Amendment.

Chester Wickwire

Chester "Chet" L. Wickwire (December 11, 1913 – August 31, 2008) was chaplain emeritus of the Johns Hopkins University. He was a prominent fighter for civil rights and an international peace activist. Reverend Wickwire was remembered as a "consummate humanist" after his death.
Personal life and education.
Wickwire was born in Nebraska but was raised in rural Colorado where he received a religious upbringing as a Seventh-day Adventist. He received his B.A. from Union College in Lincoln, Neb. During the 1940s he earned the first of two degrees (B.D and Ph.D) from the Yale Divinity School. While at Yale, he contracted poliomyelitis, which resulted in a thirteen-month stay in a local pauper's hospital; "an experience which he credited as providing him with a broader perspective on the world." Despite his need for crutches afterwards, "Chet the Jet" earned his moniker with his boundless energy. He was ordained in the United Church of Christ. He was married to Mary Ann Wickwire for 71 years until his death. Dr. Wickwire was also an avid poet with two published collections.
His memorial service was attended by numerous community leaders and former U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes. Sen. Barbara Mikulski wrote a remembrance for the occasion.
Activities at the Johns Hopkins University.
In 1953, after graduating from the Yale Divinity School, Dr. Wickwire was hired as the Executive Secretary of the Levering Hall YMCA, located at the Johns Hopkins University. He later became the University chaplain until his retirement in 1984. He became involved in activities both on campus and in Baltimore. In 1958 he started the Tutorial Project, in which Hopkins students volunteered to help tutor Baltimore's underprivileged, largely black urban youth. This community program is still in operation. The University created the Chester Wickwire Diversity Award to honor an "undergraduate student of any race or ethnic background who promotes multicultural harmony on the Homewood Campus."
Civil rights endeavors.
Dr. Wickwire organized the first integrated concert to happen in Baltimore. It was held in 1959 at the 5th regiment armory and included Maynard Ferguson and Dave Brubeck. He worked with Baltimore's community leaders, including Walter P. Carter, and ministers in the 1960s to integrate Gwynn Oak Amusement Park. Through his work with community organizations, Dr. Wickwire came to occupy a place of high respect amongst community leaders. Upon the death of its president, Rev. Wickwire was elected the first and only white leader of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, an organization of mostly African-American ministers in Baltimore. In the spring of 1970, when police were searching for members of the Baltimore Black Panthers, they agreed to surrender only to Dr. Wickwire. He was at one time the chairman of the Maryland Advisory Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.
Peace and labor activism.
He was often at odds with the Johns Hopkins University administration as he pursued peace initiatives. He regularly invited speakers such as Philip Berrigan to speak on campus. In 1962, he was detained in Moscow along with Johns Hopkins exchange students for allededly distributing anti-Soviet literature. He supported a labor boycott of J.P. Stevens & Co. for its anti-union actions in 1977 as co-chairman of a citizens committee. He pushed for better rights and conditions in 1982 for migrant workers in Maryland as chairman of a panel advising the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Later, with the same panel, he worked to improve rights of Korean-American storeowners. During the 1990s, Dr. Wickwire made a series of trips to Central America to oppose political oppression as member of Ecumenical Program in Central America (EPICA). For his work, his was given an honorary doctorate from the University of El Salvador.

Gilbert Jerome Perlow

Gilbert "Gil" Jerome Perlow (10 February 1916 – 17 February 2007), was an American physicist famous for his work related to the Mössbauer effect, and an editor of the Journal of Applied Physics and Applied Physics Letters.
Life.
Perlow was born in New York City in 1916, and attended Townsend Harris Hall. At 16, he went to study medicine at Cornell University. However, he later switched to physics, as he said his talents did not lie in medicine. He obtained his bachelor's degree in 1936 at Cornell University. His graduate thesis "On measurements of Lα satellite x rays" was supervised by Floyd K. Richtmyer. He obtained his Ph.D from University of Chicago in 1940, where researched nuclear reactions of lithium-6. There he met his wife Mina Rea Jones, a chemist, when looking for assistance in building lithium targets.
After his Ph.D thesis, he left Chicago to work for the Naval Ordnance Laboratory and the US Naval Research Laboratory, on the detection of submarine using ultrasounds as part of the war effort. After the war, he used and modified captured V-2 rockets to make measurements on atmospheric cosmic rays, leading him to propose that most gamma rays in the atmosphere were not the cosmic rays themselves, but were rather due to Compton backscattering.
In 1952, he became a faculty member at University of Minnesota. In 1954, he moved to Illinois to work at the Argonne National Laboratory, until he retired in 1981. In 1970, he became editor of the Journal of Applied Physics and Applied Physics Letters.
In the words of John Schiffer and Charles Johnson, Perlow was a "...witty and cultured man, he enjoyed reading, sketching, listening to music, and sailing his yacht on Lake Michigan."
Work.
Other than his work on cosmic rays, and on the Mössbauer effect, Perlow worked on the hyperfine structure of iron-57 and other properties of iron atoms, such as their internal magnetic field.

Illana Katz

Illana Katz (born 1948) is an author, lecturer, and founder of Real Life Storybooks, a publisher of special needs storybooks for children. Motivated by the late 1980s news that her son Seth had autism, Katz began to educate herself about autism, including researching into the life of theoretical physicist Albert Einstein. After writing "Joey and Sam: A Heartwarming Storybook About Autism, a Family, and a Brother's Love" in 1993, circumstances led Katz to write "Sarah", a 1994 book about child molestation. By 1995 Katz and her collaborator, UCLA professor Dr. Edward Ritvo, had gathered enough material to write their 1995 book, "In a World of His Own: A Storybook About Albert Einstein", in which they concluded that Einstein did have autism. Katz continues to work in the special needs profession.
History.
In the late 1980s, Katz's son Seth (b. 1986) was diagnosed with autism. Katz equated the autism diagnosis with death, "You suffer the death of your expectations for your child." After overcoming her devastation and finding little written material on autism, Katz began speaking with others in the field and going to meetings. This gave her the details to write books about children, autism, and their vulnerability as a way to become more involved, more in control, and to make decisions for her son.
In 1992, Katz lived in West Hills, California and began collaborating on a book about autism with Dr. Edward Ritvo, a professor of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles. The book, entitled "Joey and Sam: A Heartwarming Storybook About Autism, a Family, and a Brother's Love" and published in 1993, was focused on explaining autism to 4- to 8-year-olds. Later that year, Katz founded Real Life Storybooks, a publisher of special needs storybooks for children.
Misdialed calls.
In September 1993, Katz installed a nationwide 800 number at Real Life Storybooks, where people could ask questions and directly order storybooks about real-life situations. The 800 number was one number off from another that led to a nationwide hot line designed to prevent child abuse. Katz often received misdialed child abuse calls. Despite her informing the callers that they had dialed a wrong number, the callers often continued, relating stories such as a father who wanted Katz's input on the potential harm "if he were to rape his 4-month-old daughter lying naked next to him" and a "mother of a 9-month-old who was convinced the child was trying to "get her goat" by crying." Eventually, Katz changed the 800 number per the request of the purveyors of the child abuse hotline, reasoning that "I changed my 800 number because I was asked to do so, so the callers could get the help they needed."
The misdialed phone calls had a profound effect on Katz. She began writing "Sarah", a 1994 fictional book that details efforts of a girl who received the help of Doctor Good to find the strength to tell about her molestation by her Uncle Jack. During this time, she also was influenced by a January 1994 award of $2 million to a girl who was molested.
Additional autism efforts.
While addressing issues of child abuse, Katz continued in her efforts to address child disabilities. In March 1994, Katz explained the motivation behind her efforts:"With my books, I'm trying to prevent kids from making fun of children with disabilities, being cruel because they don't know any better. That's why I'm writing. Not only to teach children about the disabilities or the diseases, but to help them grow up to be better, more caring people. Lord knows, we could use all we can get. Is it naive on my part? Probably. Am I going to try anyway? Of course."
By this time, Katz had spent six years researching the life of theoretical physicist Albert Einstein, the last two years being a collaboration with Dr. Edward Ritvo. In their research, Katz and Ritvo discovered that Einstein's parents had been very worried about him when he was a baby. Born with an unusually large head similarly to many children with autism, Einstein's grandparents thought he was a dolt, in part because he was a late talker and did poorly in school. Einstein additionally "was a loner, solitary, suffered from major tantrums, had no friends and didn't like being in crowds." In 1995, Katz and Ritvo published their 1995 book, "In a World of His Own: A Storybook About Albert Einstein". In "In a World of His Own", Katz and Ritvo review the life of Albert Einstein in view of the features of the autistic spectrum to conclude that Einstein did have autism.
Personal information.
Katz presently works with Yellen & Associates, a provider of psychological, educational, speech and language services for children of special needs. She is the recipient of the Authors' and Celebrities' "Award of Excellence" and Irwin Award. Additionally, Katz is married to David Katz. Together, they have four children, the youngest of whom has autism.

McCann brothers

The McCann brothers were three Irishmen who migrated from Ohio to Wisconsin in the mid-nineteenth century. They played an important role in the early phases of Wisconsin's lumber industry, and in the political and social organization of Chippewa County.
Their parents, Arthur McCann, who was of Irish descent, and Barbary Smith were born in Pennsylvania. In 1810, they married in Scioto County, Ohio, where the two oldest brothers, Stephen Smith McCann and Arthur J. McCann, were born in 1811 and 1814, respectively. In 1816, the youngest of the three, Daniel McCann, was born in Adams County, Ohio. A fourth brother, Thomas McCann, was born in 1824, but he stayed in Ohio.
The elder Arthur and his brother, Thomas, came to Clinton County, Ohio, in 1811, shortly after it was founded in 1810. They were among the earliest Catholics to locate here. These McCanns built and operated a pottery in Wilmington, Ohio, where they manufactured a dark colored, finely polished ware.
Stephen Smith McCann.
(October 4, 1811 - November 1, 1880) On January 16, 1831, after making his way down the Ohio River and up the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers to Tazewell County, Illinois, Stephen McCann married his first wife, Sarah Hughs, with whom he had four children. Shortly thereafter, he served, from June 1831 to May 27, 1832, in the Black Hawk War. He was a member of the "mounted volunteers" from Pekin, under Capitan John Giles Adams. Abraham Lincoln was a famous participant in this conflict, which marked the end of native armed resistance to U.S. expansion in the Northwest Territory.
After the war, he lived with Sarah in Dubuque, before it became Incorporated into the Iowa Territory. Because of its location on the Mississippi River, near forests in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Dubuque had become a center for the lumber industry. Consequently, after the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters opened northern Wisconsin to settlement, Stephen went to Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, to work in this industry. Because this town is located at the confluence of the Mississippi and Wisconsin Rivers, it had developed as a major center of the North American fur trade, where French Canadian voyageurs coming from Lake Michigan along the Fox–Wisconsin Waterway met Americans coming up the Mississippi, and Métis coming down the river from the Red River Colony in Canada.
In Prairie du Chien, on November 22,1842, Stephen McCann married his second wife, Wilhelmina Rachel Johnston, with whom he had seven children. By this time, his brothers, Arthur and Daniel, had joined him near Menomonie, Wisconsin. Here, in 1841, he had bought a sawmill from Hiram S. Allen, on the west side of the Red Cedar River. Two years later, the mill burned down. While continuing to live near Menomonie, the three brothers soon joined with Jeremiah C. Thomas to build the Blue Mill, near Lake Hallie, between Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls. Later, after several changes of ownership and many improvements, this mill was acquired by the Badger State Lumber Company and became known as Badger Mills. Its operations were discontinued in the 1890s due to a shortage of logs.
During the summer of 1845, Stephan McCann, in partnership with J. C. Thomas, put up three buildings within the present day city of Eau Claire. These structures were erected to establish a claim to the land they stood on, but Stephen moved his family into one of them. Consequently, his family, whose home was located near the corner of Eau Claire and Farwell streets, became the first permanent settlers in Eau Claire. 
In 1846, at Stephen's home, the first religious services were conducted in Eau Claire by Thomas Randall, and that fall, the first wedding took place, when George Randall married Mary LaPointe. She was the sister of Daniel McCann's wife, Margaret.
In the following year, George Randall and his brother, Simon, secured a half interest in the claim of McCann and Thomas at the mouth of the Eau Claire River and became part of a firm McCann, Randall & Thomas, which immediately began to construct a dam and sawmill. The dam was completed in October 1846.
On June 5, 1847, a terrible flood caused the Chippewa River to rise twelve feet:
( By noon,) every log, pier and boom on the Eau Claire was swept away by the fast swelling flood. In another hour the new double sawmill that had just been erected and was ready to be operated was borne almost bodily away by the resistless current.
After this destruction, the firm went bankrupt, the partnership dissolved, and J. C. Thomas went back to the Blue Mill.
On September 21, 1847, Stephan McCann moved to Chippewa Falls and became a farmer. When Chippewa County was organized on December 29, 1854, George P. Warren was Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, Stephen S. McCann was the other Supervisor, and Samuel H. Allison was the Clerk. In 1856, Stephen became the first justice of the peace in the new county and held court in his home, which had been built in 1849. In the spring of 1857, he moved to his upper farm near Eagle Point.
In September 1861, at the age of 45, Stephen enlisted in the Wisconsin Infantry, along with three of his sons and two of his sons in law. He was assigned to be Brigade Wagoner, but in March 1862, he became ill and was discharged the following month.
In 1876, Stephen Smith McCann moved to the Eau Claire home of his daughter Wilmetta McDonald, where he lived until his death of dropsy in 1880. Funeral services were held in the First Congregational Church, and he was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Eau Claire.
Arthur McCann.
(1814 - 1844) In 1840, Arthur McCann joined his brothers in Menomonie. That year, he married Rosalie Demarie, a daughter of the well-known Métis fur trader Louis Demarie. In 1832-1833, the Demarie family had been the first settlers to live in Eau Claire over the winter months. Rosalie's half-sister, Mary, had married Hiram S. Allen in 1836, and another sister, Margaret, was married to Samuel Lamb, who built the first house in Dunnville, on the bank of the Red Cedar River, 12 miles south of Menomonie. Rosalie's mother, Angeline Collins, who was also Metis, was a well known healer, physician and medicine woman. Lamb's house became a popular tavern, but he lacked business acumen, the enterprise failed, and he sold the place to Arthur.
During Arthur's partnership with his brothers and J. C. Thomas, he hired an employee named Sawyer to work at the Blue Mill. One evening, Sawyer came to the tavern, where:
McCann offered him a drink. The first drink led to another and another. The two men sat down and began to play cards. "Art figured he'd get those wages back," brother Daniel McCann said, shaking his head. The cards led to an argument. McCann stood up and dropped Sawyer with his fists. Sawyer pulled himself to the door, swearing to get revenge. He went to the cabin of Philo Stone nearby, pulling a loaded rifle off the pegs above the door, and returned to McCann's place. Knocking on the door, Sawyer waited until McCann stood in the opening and he pressed the trigger. McCann fell, mortally wounded, on his own doorstep. The waters of Spring Creek (now located in what is Eau Claire County) ran red for days, but the murderer of Arthur McCann was never apprehended.
Consequently, Arthur McCann became known as the first white man to die at the hands of another white man in the Chippewa Valley. Shortly after Arthur died his widow remarried, and in 1862, she was married for a third time to George P. Warren
Daniel McCann.
(January 26, 1816 - October 2, 1890). Daniel McCann's wife was Margaret LaPointe. Her father, Louis Sulpice Desautels LaPointe, was a French Canadian employee of the Hudson's Bay Company. He was in the thick of its conflict with the North West Company, before the two companies were forced to merge in 1820. His duties took him to the Red River Colony, where he married Emilie Bottineau in 1819. She was Métis, for her French Canadian father was also a Hudson's Bay employee, and her mother was a "Chippewa woman from the Hair Hills", which refers to a district 50 miles southwest of present day Winnipeg. Her daughter Margaret's Indian name was Mahjequa.
After he married Emily, Sulpice LaPointe moved his family from the Red River Colony to St. Anthony, Minnesota, traveling by canoe. Because the falls here prevent navigation further up the Mississippi, nearby Saint Paul, became a trading center, where goods carried by ox carts along the Red River Trails were transferred to and from steamboats. In 1830, Sulpice, taking advantage of this convenient transportation, moved down the Mississippi to Prairie du Chien, where Daniel married Margaret on December 21, 1838.
The next year, Daniel and Margaret joined his brothers in Menomonie. Soon he moved his family to Eau Claire, where they lived until Hiram Allen sold him an 88 acre parcel on April 30, 1854, for $110. This was the first transaction entered at the Register of Deeds Office, in Chippewa Falls. Its record shows that the parcel is located in Cornell, Wisconsin, near the Old Abe State Trail, 2.5 miles northeast of the dam in Jim Falls, Wisconsin. Here, Daniel built a log home, and in January 1856, was issued a tavern license, permitting him to cater to travelers on the nearby Chippewa river. By this time, he was residing in Eagle Point, where his brother Stephen owned land and would soon join him.
During the first meeting of the county Board of Supervisors, they appointed James Ermatinger, Henry O'Neil, and Daniel McCann to lay out a road to Vermillion Falls. In this context, it is interesting to note that these falls were eventually renamed "Jim Falls" in honor of Ermatinger. O'Neil was a pioneer trader and lumberman. In 1851, he built a sawmill at the mouth of a stream that flows through Eagle Point township, which became known as O'Neil Creek.
Although Daniel McCann could not read music, he could play countless marches and cotillions on his fiddle. His services were in demand at numerous balls and parties.
In 1861, a group of Indians on a trading expedition stopped at Daniel's tavern near Jim Falls. One of them, Ahgamahwegezhig or “Chief Sky", brought a pet eaglet he had captured a few months earlier. He sold the bird to McCann in exchange for a bushel of corn. That year, many of Daniel's neighbors and relatives left to fight in the American Civil War. Because of a childhood leg injury, he was not able to join them, but took the eagle to Eau Claire, where he offered the bird as a mascot to a newly recruited company, which was called the "Eau Claire Badgers". The soldiers laughed at the offer, but:
(when Daniel) cuddled the fiddle under his chin, closed his eyes for a moment and began to play "Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow," the soldiers were amazed to see the eagle dance back and forth to the music.
They bought the eagle for $2.50, named it "Old Abe", and departed for Madison, Wisconsin, where they were mustered into service as Company C of the 8th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment and given the new name "Eagle Company". The regiment became the famous "Wisconsin Eagle Regiment". With Old Abe as its mascot, it played an important role in the Western Theater of the American Civil War.
in 1890, Daniel McCann died from stomach cancer at the age of 74. Funeral services were held by the Methodist church, and he is buried in O'Neill Creek Cemetery in Eagleton.

Jo Jo in the Stars

Jo Jo in the Stars is a twelve-minute film that won the 2004 BAFTA Award for Best Animated Short Film. Created and directed by Marc Craste, it was indirectly inspired by "The Carny", a song by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.
Plot.
Madame Pica is the cold-hearted mistress of a circus of "monsters and misfits", attended each night by thousands of curious spectators. The unnamed hero is among them every night, but he is there only to see Jo Jo, the winged trapeze artist. One night after the show, he steals the keys of the cell where Jo Jo is imprisoned, freeing her. The two escape and start to dance a romantic waltz in the stars. But soon the two lovers are discovered and as a last desperate act, hand-in-hand, they jump from the highest window in the tower. Jo Jo attempts to fly the two of them to safety, but the hero loses his grip and falls to the ground. Jo Jo is blown onto a window sill and re-captured by Madame Pica. A single feather from JoJo's wing floats to the ground, landing on the hero's apparently lifeless body.
Ten years pass, and Madame Pica is in search of some new attraction to draw in the crowds. She discovers that the unnamed hero is still alive but horribly disfigured, and takes him on as the new star of the show. He is taken to the cell next to JoJo's, and the reunited lovers embrace through the bars.
Production.
Marc Craste's original aim was to make a short film based on "The Carny", a song by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He began work on a storyboard, intending it to be a "straight visual interpretation of the text", featuring live action sequences combined with 3D animation. He received encouragement from Nick Cave, but was ultimately unable to secure funding for the project.
In the following years, Craste made three one-minute films for Studio AKA, starring Madame Pica in a circus setting. Studio AKA then asked Craste to make "a longer film using the same characters, but without any murders". "JoJo in the Stars" was the result.
Craste's influences include David Lynch's "Eraserhead" (1977) and Wim Wenders's "Wings of Desire" (1987).

Office of the Comptroller General of Colombia

The Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic of Colombia () is a Colombian independent government institution that acts as the highest form of fiscal control in the country. As such, it has a mission to seek the proper allocation of resources and public funds and contribute to the modernization of the state, by means of continuous improvement in the various public entities. It is one of the Colombian Control Institutions along with the Office of the Inspector General of Colombia.
History.
In 1923, after several years of financial crisis, President Pedro Nel Ospina requested an expert committee to study Colombian economic conditions. This committee, led by American economist Edwin Walter Kemmerer (known as "The Money Doctor") was called the Kemmerer Mission. Kemmerer had already worked with Latin American governments; that of Mexico in 1917 and of Guatemala in 1919. 
Up until then the Court of Auditors () was the accountability agency of the nation, it was an agency of judicial and fiscal nature, but it was part of the Executive Branch. A study led by the Kemmerer Mission, with the assistance of the Colombian Finance Minister Esteban Jaramillo, recommended Congress to create the Bank of the Republic, and the Office of the Comptroller General, and to structure the laws for this function using those already existing. The Kemmerer Mission recommended the creation of the Office of the Comptroller General after considering that it could establish the necessary means for imposing a strict observance of the laws and administrative norms in the management of resources and public funds. 
Government introduced new legislation in Congress following the recommendations of the Kemmerer Mission. " Law 42 of 1923" was passed by Congress, being signed by the President of the Senate Luis de Greiff, and the President of the Chamber of Representatives Ignacio Moreno. The new law was approved and signed by President Nel Ospina and his Minister of Finance Gabriel Posada, and finally ratified by Congress on July 19, 1923.
The Office of the Comptroller General began functioning on September 1, 1923, when Law 42 took effect. The first Comptroller General of the Republic was Eugenio Andrade, who was appointed by President Ospina. The current Comptroller General is Julio César Turbay Quintero, son of former President Julio César Turbay Ayala.

Since Northern Air Cargo abandoned their regular service with the Douglas DC-6, Everts Air Cargo is the last airline in the USA to operate scheduled flights with a rather large fleet of 60-year-old piston-powered aircraft. In a 2007 video interview, the Anchorage Station Manager stated that the DC-6 was still considered to be a valuable aircraft for operations in the harsh conditions of Alaska, with excellent landing and takeoff performance on gravel runways. The downside is the difficulty to find Avgas and the maintenance labor cost. Everts Air Cargo estimates a ratio of 12 hours of maintenance for every single flying hour. Spare parts could also be a problem but Everts Air Cargo anticipates they will have enough in stock to keep the last DC-6 flying until 2015.

List of Bengali poets

This List of Bengali Poets includes poets who write in Bengali language and produce Bengali poetry. This list classifies poets into three groups based on geographical location. These are poets from Bangladesh, poets from West Bengal of India and poets from other parts of the world including Bengali Diaspora and non-Bengali people writing poetry in Bengali. However, the list starts with early Bengali poets to be followed by those who are identified not only with Indian sub-continent before partition in 1947, but also as founders of Bengali poetry. The list also contains separate sub-lists of “rhyme composers” and “song writers”. Finally there are two sub-sets of "woman poets" and "poets in exile".
Early poets.
Siddhacharyas.
The poets of the "Charyapada", known as the Siddhacharyas, lived in eastern India and Nepal. The surviving 50 manuscripts contains the name of 24 Siddhacharyas including Lui Pa, Kukkuri Pa, Birua Pa, Gundari Pa, Chatil Pa, Bhusuku Pa, Kanha Pa, Kambalambar Pa, Dombi Pa, Shanti Pa, Mahitta Pa, Bina Pa, Saraha Pa, Shabar Pa, Aryadeb Pa, Dhendhan Pa, Darik Pa, Bhade Pa, Tadak Pa, Kankan Pa, Ja’anandi Pa, Dham Pa, Tanti Pa and Loridombi Pa. Most of these names were pseudonyms as the poets rejected Vedic Hinduism and profess Sahajayana Buddhism. Lui Pa is considered as the earliest poet of Charjapadas. Kanha Pa’s 11 poems survived which is the largest number among these poets.

Karim Aït-Fana (; born 25 February 1989) is a Moroccan international footballer who plays for French club Montpellier in Ligue 1. Aït-Fana can play in a variety of attacking positions, which include playing in the hole, as a winger, and in the attacking midfield position. Though born in France, Aït-Fana's father is from Azrou and his mother is from Meknes.
Career.
Aït-Fana was born in Limoges and began his career playing for his local club, Air Limoges. At the age of thirteen, he was selected to attend the Centre de Formation de Châteauroux, a regional youth academy that is comparable to that of the Clairefontaine academy, in order to receive further training. While training at Châteauroux during the week, he played with hometown club Limoges FC on the weekends. After spending two years at the academy, he joined Montpellier.
Aït-Fana made his professional football debut on 12 May 2006, the final match day of the 05-06 Ligue 2 season, coming on as a late-match substitute playing 9 minutes in a 0–1 loss to Le Havre. The following season, his playing time increased to 13 matches. He also scored his first goal during this season on 27 April 2007 against LB Châteauroux in a 1–3 defeat. Aït-Fana's role in the team was greatly expanded for the 2007–08 season as he appeared in 37 total matches. He scored his only two goals for the season in the final league match of the season against FC Libourne-Saint-Seurin, which Montpellier won 5–0.
Montpellier earned promotion to Ligue 1 following the club's successful campaign during the 2008–09 season with Aït-Fana having an influential role. He scored a career-high six goals during the campaign including the winner against Guingamp late in the season with the club in the midst of a promotion battle. Due to his successful season, Aït-Fana was given a contract extension with the club until the year 2012. In his first season with Montpellier in Ligue 1, Aït-Fana has been a revelation in the team, which has reached as high as 2nd position in the league. He has scored impressive goals against Sochaux, Boulogne, Le Mans, and Marseille. Montpellier went undefeated in the five league matches Aït-Fana has scored in.
In Montpellier's last home game of the 2011–12 campaign, Aït-Fana scored a last minute goal in a 1-0 win over Lille after coming off the bench.
International career.
Aït-Fana has been active on the international youth circuit for France. He has earned limited caps with the under-16s, under-17s, under-18s, and the under U-19 squad. After not representing France for over a year and a half, it was speculated that Aït-Fana would follow in the footsteps on fellow French-born Moroccan Marouane Chamakh and play for Morocco, his country of origin. However, on 1 October 2009, he was called up to the France under-21 team by coach Erick Mombaerts for their 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification matches against Malta on 9 October and Belgium on 13 October. Aït-Fana made his debut in the Malta match appearing as a substitute in the 76th minute.

Dandelion coffee

Dandelion coffee (also dandelion tea) is a tisane or "herbal tea", and coffee substitute, made from the root of the dandelion plant. The roasted dandelion root pieces and the beverage have some resemblance to coffee in appearance and taste.
History.
Susanna Moodie explained how to prepare dandelion coffee in her memoir of living in Canada, "Roughing it in the bush" (1852), where she mentions that she had heard of it from an article published in the 1830s in "New York Albion" by a certain Dr. Harrison.
Dandelion coffee was later mentioned in a "Harpers New Monthly Magazine" story in 1886. In 1919, dandelion root was noted as a source of cheap coffee. It has also been part of edible plant classes dating back at least to the 1970s.
Harvesting.
Harvesting dandelion roots requires differentiating 'true' dandelions ("Taraxacum" spp.) from other yellow daisy-like flowers such as catsear and hawksbeard. True dandelions have a ground-level rosette of deep-toothed leaves and hollow straw-like stems. Large plants that are 3–4 years old, with taproots approximately 0.5 inch (13 mm) in diameter, are harvested for dandelion coffee. These taproots are similar in appearance to pale carrots.
Preparation.
After harvesting, the dandelion roots are dried, chopped, and roasted. They are then ground into granules which are steeped in boiling water to produce dandelion coffee.
Benefits.
Dandelion coffee is said to be a good tonic for the liver.
A bitter tonic made from the dandelion root is also used as a laxative.
Dandelion tea is also currently being researched for cancer treatment.

Niobrara Reservation

The Niobrara Reservation is a former Indian Reservation in northeast Nebraska. It originally comprised lands for both the Santee Sioux and the Ponca, both Siouan-speaking tribes, near the mouth of the Niobrara River at its confluence with the Missouri River. In the late nineteenth century the United States government built a boarding school at the reservation for the Native American children in the region. By 1908 after allotment of plots to individual households of the tribes under the Dawes Act, were reserved for an agency, school and mission for a distinct Santee Sioux Reservation; the neighboring Ponca Reservation had only reserved for agency and school buildings.
Santee Sioux.
In 1884, John Lenger organized an all-Indian brass band on the Niobrara Reservation, the Santee Sioux Band. The group
demonstrated the musical ability of the Santee and presented them in a favorable light to their white neighbors. The band, led by Lenger, appeared at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893 and at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha in 1898 .. ... a special command performance for President Benjamin Harrison.
In 1890, Special Agent Reuben Sears described the land as unsuitable for farming without irrigation. "Perhaps half of the lands on this reservation would produce half a crop usually, while the other half is absolutely worthless, except for grazing, and 10 acres of this would be requisite to sustain 1 steer ... Timber is not abundant on this reservation. A sufficient quantity is found for fuel and posts, and for present use only." The Indian population at the Santee and Flandreau Agency at that time was 869. The Santee were described as a community that raised ponies and horses and lived in log or frame houses with barns, but did not like to keep milk cows or hogs. The Santee displayed aptitude for music and carpentry, and continued their customs of moving between summer and winter homes and "congregating together." Sears concluded that "The Santees are practically self-sustaining, although occupying an almost barren reservation."
Sears noted that the Santee simply stopped talking altogether if asked about their tribal history or religious beliefs. Their unwillingness to discuss their history is understandable, given that memories of the Dakota War of 1862 were still relatively fresh. After the war, thirty-nine Sioux were killed in a mass execution in Mankato, Minnesota, and a third of the Indians imprisoned at Camp McClellan died of disease; some of these survivors were sent to Nebraska. Three hundred of the women, children, and old men at the post-war internment camp on Pike Island, near Fort Snelling, Minnesota, died due to poor conditions; in May 1863 Dakota survivors were forced aboard steamboats and relocated to the drought-stricken Crow Creek Reservation. Many of the survivors of Crow Creek moved three years later to the Niobrara Reservation.
Ponca.
By contrast, the Ponca on the reservation numbered about 217 people, raised cattle and hogs, and were willing to discuss their history and religion. They lived in small frame houses, and had adequate rainfall and well water to maintain well-kept farms.
1930s archaeological survey.
In the 1930s, an archeological survey was begun on the Ponca/Niobrara Reservation south of the Niobrara River and Lynch, Nebraska. In an effort to identify and save prehistoric artifacts before they were destroyed during agricultural development, the University of Nebraska and the Smithsonian Institution undertook a joint project. The team excavated a prehistoric Ponca village; the ten laborers on the project were paid by the Works Progress Administration of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression. The project was to survey, identify and protect ancient resources. The Ponca village included large circular homes up to sixty feet in diameter; their residences were located for almost two miles (3 km) along the south bank of the Niobrara River.
Niobrara Island was included in the original reservation.

Labio-palatalization

A labio-palatalized sound is one that is simultaneously labialized and palatalized. Typically the roundedness is compressed, like , rather than protruded like . The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet for this secondary articulation is , a superscript , the symbol for the labio-palatal approximant. If such sounds pattern with other, labialized, consonants, they may instead be transcribed as palatalized consonants plus labialization, , as with the = of Abkhaz or the = of Akan. 
The labial-palatal approximant occurs in Mandarin Chinese and French, but is uncommon, as it is generally dependent upon the presence of front rounded vowels such as and , which are themselves not common. However, the labial-palatal approximant and labio-palatalized consonants also appear in languages without front rounded vowels in the Caucasus and West Africa, such as Abkhaz, and as allophones of labialized consonants before , including the at the beginning of the language name "Twi." In Russian, and trigger labialization of any preceding consonant, including palatalized consonants, so that "нёс" 'he carried' is pronounced .

Nothing Ever Happens

"Nothing Ever Happens" is a song by the Scottish rock band Del Amitri. Released as a single between late 1989 and early 1990, it reached #11 in the UK charts (it was the band's biggest hit in the UK), and was a top-10 hit in Ireland, peaking at #4. It is the last track on the album "Waking Hours". 
Lyrics and Composition.
The song deals with the banality of everyday life, with the refrain "and we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow." Its commentary relates to how oblivious most of us are to the world around us e.g. "the Martians could land in the car park and no one would care" but in its last line before the chorus becomes suddenly cynical..."they'll burn down the Synagogues at six o'clock and we'll all go along like before," which is a reference to Kristallnacht.

<doc id="20470283" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20470283" title="Devrimci Yol">
Devrimci Yol

Devrimci Yol (Turkish for "Revolutionary Path", shortly DEV-YOL) was a Turkish political movement (as opposed to a tightly structured organization) with many supporters in trade unions and other professional institutions. Its ideology was based on Marxism-Leninism but rejected both the Soviet and the Chinese model in favor of a more native Turkish model. Devrimci Yol entered the political scene in Turkey on 1 May 1977 with its manifesto called "bildirge". Its roots can be seen in a movement that called itself Devrimci Gençlik ("Revolutionary Youth", short DEV-GENÇ), and it followed the thesis of the People's Liberation Party-Front (Turkish abbreviation THKP-C) expressed by Mahir Çayan.
Self-portrayal.
The defence in the central trial against members of Devrimci Yol at Ankara Military Court included the following lines:
The brochure published in Hamburg in November 1980 carried the emblem of the organization (fist on top of a star) and therefore the views expressed there reflect the attitude of the organization:
External sources.
In a report on the central trial against Devrimci Yol in Ankara Amnesty International wrote in June 1988: 
In April 1997, the Swiss Refugee Support Organization (in German ":de:Wikipedia:Schweizerische Flüchtlingshilfe", SFH) published a report simply called "Türkei - Turquie". The report included detailed information on many legal and illegal Turkish and Kurdish organization. On Devrimci Yol, it stated "inter alias":
The question of violence.
"The journal and supporters of Dev-Yol were not opposed to violence, but tried to put into practice a defence policy centred around the idea of 'committees of resistance', which were to counter attacks against the population by right-wing militants known as the Grey Wolves." The first resistance committees ("direniş komiteleri") were formed since Devrimci Yol believed that there was a civil war in Turkey. Arms were to be used in defence. One of the main goals of the committees was the establishment of cooperatives of production. In Fatsa, for instance, a hazelnut cooperative was founded.
Yet, militants of Devrimci Yol were not only engaged in bitter fightings against right wing militants but also clashed with other left groups. In these fights some 5,000 people lost their lives until the military coup of September 1980. Actually the defence in the central trial against Devrimci Yol presented more detailed figures. According to these figures among the total of 5,388 victims 2,109 had been left-wingers, 1,286 had been right-wingers and 268 had belonged to other groups. Besides 94 children killed in these fightings 281 members of the security forces had been killed. In 1,350 cases it had been impossible to determine the background.
Resistance committees in practice.
The "resistance" committees (organized in factories or quarters) were "put to the test" during the incidents in Çorum in July 1980. Just like the conflict in Kahramanmaraş in December 1978 the clashes in Çorum seemed to emerge from religious tensions between the dominant Sunnites and the minority of Alevites, but at the same time were a battle between right and left wing groups for domination in the town. Talking about fascist aggression the committees in the quarters erected barricades trying to avoid further losses.
Although a curfew was announced and the military intervened some 50 people were killed. While the conflict in Çorum was still continuing Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel intervened by saying "Çorum'u bırak, Fatsa'ya bak" (Leave Çorum and look at Fatsa). He was referring to the district town at the Black Sea of (at the time some 20,000 inhabitants) who in 1979 had elected Fikri Sönmez, known as "terzi Fikri" ("Tailor Fikri") as mayor with 62% of the votes. The words of Demirel resulted in the so-called "point operation" ("nokta operasyonu"), a military operation that destroyed the project of self-administration in Fatsa (in German :de:Selbstverwaltung in Fatsa). More than 1,000 people were detained. The military operation in Fatsa was often termed "rehearsal for the coup".
Prosecution of Devrimci Yol members.
After the military coup of 12 September 1980 tens of thousands of men and women were taken into custody. More than 30,000 were jailed in the first four months after the coup. Alleged members of Devrimci Yol were detained in many parts of the country and tried at military courts. Many of these trials involved several hundred defendants.
Mass trials.
The list of mass trials against alleged members of Devrimci Yol and the number of death penalties passed in these trials is based on press reports collected by the "alternative türkeihilfe"
Executions.
Between 1980 and 1984 a total of 50 people including 27 political prisoners were executed in Turkey. Executed for violent activities as members of Devrimci Yol were:
Deaths in custody.
After the military coup of September 1980 the number of deaths in custody increased decisively. Many of them were alleged to be the result of torture. The victims included persons who had been detained on suspicion of being members of Devrimci Yol. They included:
Current situation.
Some cadres of Devrimci Yol, who managed to leave the country formed an organization in Europe called "Devrimci İşçi" (Revolutionary Worker) and for some time published a paper called "Demokrat Türkiye", but later dissolved. In April 1991 the Law to Fight Terrorism (Law 3713) entered into force in Turkey. Temporary Article 1 of this law provided that all death sentences would be commuted to 10 years' imprisonment. Subsequently most long-term prisoners including the leading members of Devrimci Yol were released. Most of them joined the Freedom and Solidarity Party ("Özgürlük ve Dayanışma Partisi", ÖDP). Some people tried to revive Devrimci Yol. Attempts can be seen around journals such as "Yön" (Direction), "Devrim" (Revolution), "Devrimci Gençlik" (Revolutionary Youth), "Liseli Genç Umut" (Hope for Youth at School) or "Halkın Sesi" (Voice of the people). Other attempts of reorganizing the group have remained at a low level.

The Millennium Tower and Cultural Centre project is one of the many projects in the Central District of Nigeria's capital city of Abuja. At , the tower would be the tallest building in Nigeria. The tower was designed by Manfredi Nicoletti and is part of the Nigeria National Complex which includes the Nigeria Cultural Centre and Municipal Building. Construction started in 2006 and is due to be completed in time for the 20th birthday of Nigeria’s new capital in 2011.
The 170 metre tower will be Nigeria's tallest building when completed along with an eight storey, low rise, pyramid shaped Cultural Centre. Located in Abuja, the site is severed by a main road so the two buildings will be linked via an underground arcade. The tower consists of three cylindrical concrete pillar-like structures varying in height and linked together near the towers first peak using a disc shaped section which will house in its two floors, an observation decks and a restaurant where visitors will be able to enjoy spectacular views of the city below while they eat. Around the pillars of the tower three transparent stainless steel wings wrap delicately but protectively around the base of the tower and gradually open outwards in a fan like fashion as they extend up the height of the tower.

Voices (Henze)

Voices is a musical composition by the German composer Hans Werner Henze.
Written between January and June 1973, it is a collection of 22 independent songs which may be performed individually, with alterations to the instrumentation. In its full version, it is written for mezzo-soprano, tenor, electronics and fifteen instrumentalists who are required to play about 70 different instruments from all over the world. The piece makes use of radio broadcasts, sports commentaries, a speech by John F. Kennedy and an extract from Sibelius's Second Symphony.
The songs set a diverse range of words, almost all of which are from the twentieth century, the linking theme being alienation and oppression. Henze has said: The voices of the title are those of young and old artists whose work is politically committed. These people are concerned with their fellow human beings, with the contemporary human condition within the world around them and with all the problems of race and class in which they themselves often seem fated to be embroiled.
It was premiered on 4 January 1974 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London with soloists Paul Sperry and Rose Taylor, and the London Sinfonietta conducted by Henze. In 1978 it was recorded the same forces, except Sarah Walker who took the mezzo role.

General election.
Campaign.
This election was in conjunction to the presidential election, where Bush narrowly defeated Gore after an intense recount. The senate election was evenly matched with two U.S. Congressmen named Bill in their mid-50s. Both parties heavily targeted this senate seat. The election became very nasty as Nelson called his opponent "an extremist who would sacrifice the elderly, the poor, and the working class to coddle the rich." McCollum called the Democrat "a liberal who would tax everything that moves, and some things that don't." The election advertisements were very negative, as both candidates talked more about each other than themselves. 
Nelson raised only soft money, but had help from President Bill Clinton and VP Al Gore. Two days before the election, McCollum predicted he would win by a 6 point margin. On election day, he lost by a 5 point margin.

<doc id="20470456" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20470456" title="Omaha Reservation">
Omaha Reservation

The Omaha Reservation of the federally recognized Omaha tribe is located mostly in Thurston County, Nebraska, with sections in neighboring Cuming and Burt counties, in addition to Monona County in Iowa. As of the 2000 federal census, the reservation population was 5,194. The tribal seat of government is in Macy. The villages of Rosalie, Pender and Walthill are located within reservation boundaries, as is the northernmost part of Bancroft. Due to land sales in the area since the reservation was established, Pender has disputed tribal jurisdiction over it.
The reservation was established by a treaty dated March 16, 1854. The tribe chose the lands with the President's approval on May 11, 1855. A treaty on March 6, 1865, followed by two acts of Congress on June 10, 1872 and June 22, 1874, ratified the agreement.
On July 31, 1874, the tribe deeded part of its reservation to the Winnebago (also known as Ho-Chunk) to form the Winnebago Reservation just north of the Omaha Reservation. This action was ratified on August 7, 1882 and by an act on Congress dated March 3, 1893. were allotted to 1,577 Indians with the remaining land, , unallotted.
Boundary disputes.
Boundary claims and areas of jurisdiction have continued to be issues for the Omaha Indian Reservation. In the late nineteenth century, Congress authorized sales of land to non-Omaha in the western portion of the reservation, where European-American farmers had settled. Due to the sales and federal legislation subsequent to the treaty establishing the reservation, a Nebraska state court in 2000 ruled that the western boundary of the reservation ended at railroad tracks east of Pender, Nebraska. 
The Omaha Tribe contends that Pender is within tribal jurisdiction, as Congress did not change the boundaries of reservation, which includes most of Thurston County. The tribe says that the state does not have the power to redefine the boundary set by the Omaha treaty with the US government in 1865. It holds that although Congress authorized land sales in this area, it did not diminish the jurisdiction of the tribe within the reservation boundaries. "Under Supreme Court precedent, only Congress can diminish a reservation."
Asked for its opinion on a related matter related to the Omaha Tribe's law that liquor merchants on the reservation had to pay tribal license fees and sales taxes (see section below), the Nebraska state attorney general noted its opinion, based on Congressional laws and a field ruling during the Ronald Reagan administration, that Pender was outside the reservation boundaries. It also noted that ultimately this was a matter of federal jurisdiction. 
There have been continuing issues related to tribal jurisdiction in Pender and other areas along its western boundary. For instance, in 2003 the tribal police tried to stop non-Omaha people from entering the reservation from Pender. The tribe negotiated with the state in 2003-2004 related to its policing functions in this area, but the parties signed no agreement. Prior to this period, the state generally had policing functions on the roads and in Pender.
Current issues.
In December 2006, the Omaha Tribe issued notices to the seven liquor stores in Pender (which has a population of 1,000), as well as those in Rosalie and Walthill, Nebraska, informing them that as of January 1, 2007, the merchants would have to pay the Omaha Tribe liquor licensing fees and a 10 percent sales tax to continue to operate within the reservation. The executive director of the Nebraska State Liquor Commission said that he would be consulting with the state attorney general on the issue. Ben Thompson, an Omaha attorney who represents the tribe, notes that it has the legal right to establish such laws within the reservation. The Nebraska Attorney General offered the opinion that the Omaha Tribe had the authority to regulate liquor sales on its reservation and it did not interfere with the Nebraska Liquor Commission. While offering an opinion, he said the tribal boundary was a federal jurisdictional issue.
In April 2007, liquor merchants in Pender (later joined by the village) filed a federal lawsuit challenging the tribe's authority to demand the liquor taxes, based on their contention that Pender was outside the reservation boundaries. In October 2007 the US District Court ordered the parties first to take their challenge to the Omaha Tribal Courts, as part of the tribal exhaustion doctrine, and denied the plaintiffs' request for dismissal. Judge Richard Kopf said he may not be bound by the tribal court, but wanted to hear their opinion. He required the parties to report back to him regularly until a ruling was made by the Omaha Tribal Courts. While the case was pending, the judge ordered a temporary stay on the merchants' paying the liquor sales tax.
In January 2012, the plaintiffs in "Pender v. Omaha Tribe" filed a request with the Omaha Tribal Courts for a summary judgment due to the length of time the case had taken. The defendants had requested that no hearing be held before June 2012. The plaintiffs had submitted a report to them by an expert witness on transactions related to Pender and the western boundary. In 2008 the village had voted for a five-year, 1% sales tax to finance its lawsuit on the boundary and liquor tax, as well as to promote economic development in the town. Residents voted in May 2012 on whether to renew the sales tax, as the boundary issue continued.

2008 Jos riots

The 2008 Jos riots were riots involving Christians and Muslims over the result of a local election on 28 and 29 November 2008 in Jos, a community in the Middle Belt region of Nigeria. Two days of rioting left over 400 injured and 381 killed. The Nigerian army arrived on the morning of the 30th, and order was restored.
Causes.
Electoral workers did not publicly list the winners of the elections, and rumours began that the election was won by the candidate of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), barrister Timothy Gyang Buba, defeating the candidate for the All Nigerian Peoples Party. People from the largely Muslim Hausa community, began protesting even before the results were released, and started to attack Christian homes and churches by midnight. Violence escalated between them and the Christians, who largely supported Buba.
Riots.
The rioting led to the death of over 381 people in central Nigeria in only two days of clashing, and several homes, mosques, churches and a seminary were damaged or burned by mobs. The Nigerian Red Cross Society reported that 10,000 people fled their homes due to the riots, and were living in government-provided shelters. Nigerian soldiers were sent into Jos to break up the fighting and create a buffer zone between the Christians and Muslims.
Effects.
Jonah Jang, the governor of the Plateau State, imposed a 24-hour curfew on four districts of the city, and soldiers are permitted to "shoot on sight" to prevent more violence. Flights to and from Jos were cancelled and roads to the north were blocked.
Similar riots in 2001 between Christians and Muslims in Jos also killed hundreds. A 2004 riot in Yelwa, another town in Plateau State resulted in the so-called Yelwa Massacre. Fighting in the north-central Kaduna State when it tried to impose shari'a law in 2000, resulted in the partition of Kaduna. This was followed by the Kaduna riots of November 2002, resulting from Nigeria's hosting of the Miss World contest, which one of its contestants had won the previous year.
Many armed youths of both sides were arrested at military roadblocks. Police estimated that as many as 500 were arrested on Saturday, 29 November, alone.

In 1910, a loose association of alumni of the prestigious Gakushuin Peer’s School in Tokyo began a literary society. Members included writers, artists, literary critics and others who rejected Confucianism and the strictures of traditional Japanese literary and artistic styles. In particular, the group emphasized idealism, humanism and individualism, over the naturalism that had been the dominant trend in Japanese literature of the Taisho period. The "Shirakaba-ha" thought highly of Western aesthetics (particularly Expressionism and Post-Impressionism), and considered their mission to spread the ideas of Western art and Western literature into Japan. Unlike many other literary circles, The Shirakaba-ha did not limit their interest to literature, but also delved into other art forms. 
However, the group remained deeply interested in Japanese culture, particularly in folk art, which had previously been disparaged by traditional art critics.
Early members included Shiga Naoya (1883-1971), Mushanokōji Saneatsu (1885-1976), Yanagi Sōetsu (1889-1961), Satomi Ton (1888-1983), Arishima Takeo (1878-1923) and Nagayo Yoshirō(1888-1961). Their literature was typically of the ‘I novel’ genre, and was concerned with the life of individuals, often incorporating optimistic philosophy into their work. Some of these individuals came with wealthy families, and attempted to emulate Tolstoy in creating utopian agrarian communes in remote parts of Japan.
The self-published monthly literary journal "Shirakaba" ("White Birch") was in circulation from April 1910 until 1923. The magazine reached its peak in popularity in 1918. However, publication was discontinued after the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake.

Nysa Bridge

The Nysa Bridge is a late imperial Roman bridge over the Cakircak stream in Nysa (modern Sultanhisar) in the ancient region of Caria, modern-day Turkey. The long substructure was the second largest of its kind in antiquity, after the Pergamon Bridge.
Dating.
The Greek geographer Strabo (63 BC–AD 21), who lived in Nysa, mentioned a secret water conduit in the town, but it remains unclear whether he meant the existing tunnel-like bridge. An inscription at the northern wall of the tube, close to a bend after , indicates a construction date in late imperial times. It reads "Work of Praülos until this point".
Construction.
The Nysa Bridge served as a substructure for the area in front of the city theatre which lay close to the Cakircak stream. It was built as a two-level structure: the bottom vault spanned the brook. On top of it a row of arches connected the two hills that formed the urban area. The ground arch spanned the stream on a length of some , giving the bridge the appearance of a tube or a tunnel, although it was constructed entirely above ground. It consists of a single, wide vault whose uphill mouth widens to . The overall height of its semi-circular arch is , featuring a rise of . The vault is made of rubble stone laid in mortar, resting on a substructure of ashlar stone blocks of varying size (0.3–0.9 x 1.0–1.4 m). Originally featuring a continuous vaulting, it is collapsed today between m 75 and 85, and again at the downhill exit. The remaining, isolated structure at the downstream side has often been incorrectly referred to as a bridge of its own. The Nysa Bridge was the second largest bridge substruction of its kind in antiquity, only surpassed by the nearby Bridge at Pergamon. By comparison, the width of a normal, free standing Roman bridge did not exceed . 
In its further course, the Cakircak also ran through the city stadion, so that naumachia could be given. There are remains of two other ancient bridges both up- and downstream.
Discharge capacity.
The capacity limit of the Nysa Bridge in case of floods has been the subject of hydraulic and hydrological research. The gradient of the tunnel was calculated as 3.3% with a maximum discharge capacity of 290 m³/s. Exceeding this limit puts the bridge under internal pressure and damages the structure in the process. Considering that the Cakircak is long, with a median gradient of 19% and a drainage basin of , the following median intervals were calculated, depending on the method employed:
The study came to the conclusion that statistically every 13,500 years, a value which has been referred to as the "arithmetic mean", floods are to be expected which would exceed the capacity of the bridge.

1980 Dallas Cowboys season

The 1980 Dallas Cowboys season was their 21st in the league. The team improved their previous output of 11–5, winning twelve games. They qualified for the playoffs as an NFC Wild Card, but lost in the Conference Championship.
The season featured a very unusual end to the regular season. Going into the final week of the season, Dallas (at 11–4) played Philadelphia (12–3) at Texas Stadium. Under the NFL's tiebreaking rules, if Dallas could beat the Eagles by 25 points, they would earn the NFC's number one seed and homefield advantage throughout the playoffs. However, if they lost (or won by less than 25) then Philadelphia would get the number one seed and (since they played in the same division) Dallas would be a wildcard team. Dallas led 35–10 in the fourth quarter, but the Eagles rallied to lose only 35–27. This forced Dallas to play an extra week in the playoffs and a road game in Atlanta in the divisional round. Dallas ultimately lost at Philadelphia in the NFC Championship game.
