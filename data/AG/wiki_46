François Fleury-Richard

Fleury François Richard (25 February 1777, Lyon – 14 March 1852, Écully), sometimes called Fleury-Richard, was a painter of the École de Lyon. A student of Jacques-Louis David, Fleury-Richard and his friend Pierre Révoil were precursors of the Troubador style.
Life.
The son of a magistrate, Fleury François Richard studied at the collège de l'Oratoire in Lyon then at the école de Dessin under Alexis Grognard. At the latter he met Pierre Révoil. In 1796 he joined the Paris studio of Jacques-Louis David. His first paintings had major success and he mingled with the Paris intelligentsia, among whom the Troubador style was highly favoured. He became the favourite painter of empress Joséphine de Beauharnais, who bought many of his paintings, so that the European renown gained by his first works was recognised by Madame de Staël.
In 1808 he set up his own studio at the palais Saint-Pierre at Lyon, having been granted it by the city for the benefits he had brought to it by his reputation. He was initiated into the Scottish Rite Masonic Lodge of Isis in 1809, and in 1814 married a banker's daughter, Blanche Menut. He was made a knight of the Légion d'honneur in 1815.
Seeking inspiration, he visited Geneva, Milan, Turin and the Dauphiné. He served as a professor at the École des beaux-arts de Lyon from 1818 to 1823. In 1851 he set himself up at Écully, devoting himself to writing. He edited his "Souvenirs", lives of painters and a work on painting in the second-order towns of France, "Quelques réflexions sur l'enseignement de la peinture dans les villes de second ordre".
Critique.
Fleury Richard received his first lessons in Lyon, a silk-producing town, but he was mainly formed by his time in the neoclassical atmosphere of David's studio. Like other English and German artists of the era Fleury-Richard was passionate about history and fascinated by medieval chivalry and the Renaissance. His visit to the Musée des monuments français, where he saw the tomb of Valentina Visconti on display, inspired his first major work in a utopian and melancholic Troubadour style, which also originated in David's studio. This style would impose a powerful historicist current on the masters of the 14th and 15th centuries, a more anecdotal that truly historical iconography. François-René Martin presents this tendency as "a retreat into the private sphere. Richard was notably amazed by the works attributed to the king-poet "bon Roi René" and most particularly by his art history treatise "Le Cuer d’amours espris".
On his return to Lyon, he cultivated his friendship with Pierre Révoil and, with Révoil and a small inner-circle, discovered nature and the archaeological remains around Lyon, in Fourvière, Saint-Just or the Île Barbe. It was in this context that Révoil, in 1798, showed both nature and remains in a drawing he offered to his "brother". To the Troubadour painters' historicism he blended "a poetry of nature" and "researches into distance or loneliness". Also the abandoned crypt of Saint Irénée at Saint-Just was used by Fleury-Richard in his studies for "A Knight in prayer in a chapel, preparing himself for combat"; the construction used in "Young girl at a fountain" was a Roman sarcophagus at Île-Barbe; also at Île-Barbe, associated to the cloister of Notre-Dame-de-l'Isle at Vienne in "The Hermitage of Vaucouleurs".
When some scholars at the start of the 20th century sought to connect him to the école lyonnaise despite his training in Paris, his national career and his painting – the historical genre was not specific to Lyon. 
In Fleury-Richard's critical writings scholars find a reflection prefiguring of his attachment to Symbolism before Symbolism even existed: "Painting is not an imitation of reality. It is a symbol, a figurative language which presents the image of thought; and thought rises to the source of infinite beauty, there finding the archetypical forms signalled by Plato, of which created beings are only copies."

Archaeologia Cambrensis

Archaeologia Cambrensis is an archaeological and historical scholarly journal that is published annually by the Cambrian Archaeological Association. It contains excavation reports, book reviews, and historical essays, as well as society notes and accounts of field visits. The journal has included "much valuable material on the manuscripts, genealogy, heraldry, toponymy, folklore and literature of Wales".
The publication history of the journal is complicated, with inconsistent volume numbering and multiple series. It is in the process of being digitized by the Welsh Journals Online project at the National Library of Wales.
Scope of the Journal.
The Journal covers all aspects of the Archaeology of Wales and the Welsh Marches from the earliest Prehistoric discoveries to the Industrial Archaeology and Landscape history of the 19th and 20th centuries. On occasions, and particularly in the earlier years articles have been published on the archaeology of other Celtic Lands (Brittany, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Ireland). In the 19th century articles in the Journal tended to concentrate on Prehistoric Monuments (particularly Cromlechs, Chambered tombs and Hill-forts; Roman sites; Inscribed stones and other discoveries of the Dark Ages and the architecture of Medieval Wales, especially of Churches, Castles and Monasteries.
Increasingly the Journal has carried longer articles on excavations and field surveys in Wales, and more recently many of these articles have been grant aided by Cadw. As the 20th century progressed, and more recently in the 21st century, the Journal has carried more synoptic articles treating a particular topic in greater depth. An example of this was in 2005 when the Journal was largely devoted to the “Cistercians in Wales and the West”. Domestic architecture now figures prominently in the Journal, ranging from Stately homes to the Vernacular architecture of Welsh countryside, and also the landscape of Parks and Gardens. The evolution of Towns and the development of Urban archaeology in Wales are also covered.

Elisabeth Gilman

Elisabeth Coit Gilman (December 25, 1867 – December 14, 1950) was an American socialist and civil liberties advocate.
Early life.
Elisabeth Coit Gilman was born in New Haven, Connecticut on December 25, 1867 to Daniel Coit Gilman and Mary Ketcham Gilman. Elisabeth was the second child, and had an older sister named Alice. Their mother, Mary, died in 1869 and, as a result, were cared for by Daniel's sister Louise.
At the age of seven, Elisabeth's father took the post as the first president of Johns Hopkins University and the family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. She was cared for by a governess until her father remarried. In 1877, Daniel married Elisabeth Dwight Woolsey (1838–1910) of the New England Dwight family, with whom Elisabeth Gilman developed a close relationship.
Gilman attended Miss Hall's School until age eleven, when due to eye trouble, she was tutored by her governess at home. When her eyesight improved, Elisabeth attended the Springside School in Philadelphia at age seventeen. It was planned that she would attend Bryn Mawr College.
Political life.
Instead of attending Bryn Mawr, Gilman traveled to France as a representative of the National Committee on Surgical Dressings. While in France, she also worked for the YMCA. It was at this time that she was introduced to the concepts of Socialism. When Gilman returned to the United States at the age of twenty, she entered into social work at the request of her father. Eventually, in 1921, she earned her degree from Johns Hopkins University.
Gilman officially joined the Socialist Party of America on March 1, 1929. She ran for Governor of Maryland in 1930. After running for Governor, she traveled to Russia in 1931 to study the Soviet system. She returned and ran for the United States Senate in 1934 and 1938, Mayor of Baltimore in 1935, and Sheriff of Baltimore in 1942.
Platform.
Gilman campaigned for many causes; however, she was mainly involved in workers' rights, civil liberties, and racial equality. In 1921, Elisabeth helped to form The Maryland Civil Liberties Committee; this committee was a precursor to the Maryland Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1931, the ACLU would officially establish an affiliate in the state of Maryland; the meeting was held in Gilman's home.
Gilman also hosted the first public interracial dinner in Baltimore at her home in 1928 when local hotels refused to allow the dinner on their properties.
Death.
Elisabeth Gilman died on December 14, 1950 at the age of 82. She is buried at Druid Ridge Cemetery in Pikesville, Maryland.

Large Optical Test and Integration Site

The Large Optical Test and Integration Site, or LOTIS, is a facility at the Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company in Sunnyvale, CA for testing large optical components under realistic conditions. LOTIS has large, thermally stabilized vacuum chamber, vibration-isolated optical benches, and a large 6.5 meter telescope (run backwards as a collimator) to create images for the test optics to view. It can generate images from the visible through the mid-wavelength IR.
The fabrication error in the Hubble Space Telescope main mirror is the classic example that shows the need for such testing. In this case, a test facility such as LOTIS was not easily available, so the completed optics were not tested as a unit, and instead relied on careful testing of the individual components. Unfortunately, due to a mis-assembled null corrector, one of the tests was wrong, and a mis-figured mirror was not discovered until the telescope was placed into service. This is exactly the type of problem that LOTIS can detect, since it is designed to test large optical systems as a unit by creating realistic inputs and operating conditions for them.

Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel

Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (, "HaHevra LeHaganat HaTeva"), or SPNI, is an Israeli non-profit environmental organization working to preserve plants, animals, and natural environments that represent bio-diversity, by protecting the lands and waters needed for their survival, and is Israel's oldest and largest conservation organization.
History.
SPNI was founded in 1953 by Azaria Alon and Amotz Zahavi in response to plans to drain the Hula Valley. The Israeli government and JNF ultimately did drain a majority of the Hula wetlands to prevent the spread of malaria and to create agricultural land. After 40 years of SPNI campaigning, some 10% of the Hula wetlands were re-flooded in the early 1990s. 
In 1980, SPNI, together with Azaria Alon, Amotz Zahavi and Yoav Sagi, was awarded the Israel Prize for its special contribution to society and the State for the environment.
Major divisions.
Best known to the public for sponsoring hikes (today, SPNI's hikes are guided in Hebrew - the only regular nature tours in English are through SPNI-Jerusalem branch), SPNI is also active in political and environmental improvement efforts. Projects have included working out an agricultural management plan for the Hula Valley to insure the health of migrating Common Cranes, and preventing the draining of a large area of salt pans, the last breeding site in Israel for Nubian Nightjars. The campaign to create the 2004 Coastal Law, which forbids new development in any area within 300 meters from the coastline was a notable accomplishment. With almost 800 employees, SPNI is an enormous non-profit organization, with a wide range of activities, thus SPNI is known as well by its various divisions' names as it is by the name "SPNI".
Environmental Protection Division.
SPNI’s Environmental Protection Division (EPD) is the watchdog and advocate for the little remaining open space left in Israel. Mass immigration has contributed to a drain on water resources, increased land usage for housing and industrial development, and major transportation congestion and pollution issues. Israel today is highly urbanized, with one of the world’s highest population density rates. On a national level, the number of persons per square kilometer is very close to that of Japan, while the Tel Aviv area’s density is higher than that of Hong Kong. SPNI is dedicated to finding creative solutions to preserve Israel’s fragile ecosystem.
Open Landscape Institute (OLI).
Land has become a precious commodity; the economic incentive for developers is highly enticing. SPNI is at the frontline, preserving the untouched land, still in its natural state, for wildlife, birds, and recreation, while promoting sustainable development, allowing residential areas to expand without clear-cutting the forests Israel has spent so many years planting.
Birding Division.
With five hundred million birds migrating through Israel's skies twice a year, nature lovers have begun to take note of Israel's unique potential as an ornithology superpower. SPNI, through its Israel Ornithological Center (IOC) and International Center for the Study of Bird Migration (ICSBM), leads Israel’s partnership in the world of wildlife preservation and protection of bird species threatened by urbanization and economic development. 
Israel Ornithological Center (IOC) - founded in 1980, the IOC works toward preserving endangered species such as the Lesser Kestrel, cranes, and Houbara Bustard. The IOC has several successful ongoing projects, including rehabilitating and conserving habitats for birds; leading research and surveying activities; and running numerous educational programs in schools throughout Israel. 
International Center for the Study of Bird Migration (ICSBM) - the center at Latrun was founded by Yossi Leshem who was the Executive Director of the SPNI from 1991 to 1995, and is the center's director and a Senior Researcher at the Department of Zoology in the Faculty of Life Sciences at Tel Aviv University. ICSBM - Latrun is the joint initiative of SPNI and the Tel Aviv University. The center deals with many cutting edge and creative educational projects, such as migration research, flight safety, eco-education, eco-tourism, and international cooperation.
Education.
SPNI’s education programs reach Israelis of every age and sector - over 50% of Israeli children and teens are involved in SPNI education programs! SPNI believes that by fostering young people's connection to the land, heritage and to their own communities, we grow a generation that gives back to Israel in establishing a strong society, concerned with preserving Israel's natural treasures for all time.
Urban Branches.
Spearheading environmental activities in Israel’s major metropolitan areas is integral to SPNI’s overall endeavors. Field-based and hands-on, SPNI staff run urban eco-centers from which they work with residents to raise awareness of environmental issues and run educational activities for children, youth and adults to promote a sense of pride and belonging to the land. These centers also serve as the core from which SPNI assembles and coordinates grassroots activities, takes part in regional planning activities and promotes environmental issues with local government bodies. SPNI's major branches are located in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Be'er Sheva, Haifa and Modi'in.
In 2011, the Russian government asked the organization to vacate its offices in Jerusalem in the Sergei Courtyard complex.
Ecotourism.
SPNI is probably best known for its network of field schools, established adjacent to Israel’s Nature Reserves and National Parks. Tens of thousands of Israelis and tourists participate in SPNI guided hikes and walks focusing on nature study. SPNI's Field School system combines three main areas of activity: education – teaching youth and adults about the region; conservation – protecting the region’s natural environment; and research – gathering information about the region in conjunction with SPNI’s various departments. Field Schools are an integral part of SPNI’s operations, a focal area for local eco-activities, and play a leading role in Israeli environmental tourism and education.
English-language tours are offered by the Jerusalem Bird Observatory.
Israel Trails Committee (ITC).
The ITC marked and actively maintains 10,000 kilometers paths, 950 kilometers of which represents the Israel National Trail. A few full-time SPNI employees out in the field mark and repair trail markers, from the Galilee to the Negev.

Pert (sidewheeler)

Pert was a sidewheel steamboat that operated in British Columbia on the Columbia River from 1887 to 1905, often carrying a lot of timber. "Pert" was also known as "Alert", "Perty", "Papa P", "P Dog" and "City of Windermere" at times.
Design and construction.
"Pert" was built at Golden, British Columbia, by Fred Wells, who named the vessel "Alert". The vessel seems to have been originally built as a bateau, that is, an unpowered river vessel propelled by oars or by poling along the river. An engine and sidewheels were installed in 1890. 
Operations.
In 1891, Capt. Frank P. Armstrong started operating "Pert" as part of his steamboat line, the Upper Columbia Navigation & Tramway Co. (UCN&T) to operate on the headwaters of the Columbia River above Golden, an area which is known as the Columbia Valley. From 1892 to 1898, Armstrong ran "Pert" on Columbia Lake. 
Use on Columbia Lake.
The river flowing out of Columbia Lake was often too shallow for a steamboat, and so UCN&T built a mule or horse-drawn tramway extending to the northern end of Columbia Lake. Cargoes bound south to the valley of the upper Kootenay River would be loaded on the tramway, and pulled to the wharf on the lake, then loaded on "Pert". The steamboat would then paddle south across the lake to the portage at Canal Flats. The cargo would then be unloaded and portaged over to the Kootenay River. When "Pert" was running on the river, a canal and lock connected Columbia Lake with the Kootenay River. The canal was not much used; only three steamboat transits were ever made.
Sale of vessel.
In 1898 Captain Armstrong sold "Pert" to Capt. Alex Blakely, who rebuilt the vessel into a propeller-driven towboat with a new name, "City of Windermere". In 1903, Blakely sold it to Capt. E.N. Russell, who changed the vessel's name back to "Pert" and ran her on Windermere Lake and the upper Columbia River from 1903 to 1905.
Abandonment.
"Pert" was abandoned in 1905 on Windermere Lake.

Julian Konstantinov

Julian Konstantinov (Bulgarian: Юлиян Константинов) (also Yuliyan Konstantinov) (born 1966) is a Bulgarian operatic bass particularly known for his interpretations of the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Giuseppe Verdi, and the bel canto roles of Rossini and Donizetti. More recently he has become associated with the title role in Modest Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov", a role he has sung in numerous opera houses.
Career.
Konstantinov studied opera under Assen Selimski at the Bulgarian Music Academy in Sofia from 1987–1993. He made his professional opera debut while still a student at the Sofia National Opera in a minor role in Rossini's "The Barber of Seville". He also appeared in a production of Stravinsky's "The Rake's Progress" while still a student. In 1993 he garnered wide attention when he won the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition and he was soon cast is several major roles in opera houses throughout Europe. In 1995 he made his debuts with Wexford Festival Opera and the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. This was soon followed by his debut at La Scala, making him the youngest bass ever to sing at the prestigious opera house. His other international appearances have taken him to Germany, France, Spain, Holland, Brazil, Great Britain and the United States. In 1998 he recorded the role of Oroe in Rossini's "Semiramide" with Edita Gruberova in the title role. In 1999 he sang the role of Moser in Verdi's "I masnadieri" with the Opera Orchestra of New York. In 2001, he joined Angela Gheorghiu, Daniela Barcellona, Roberto Alagna, and the Berlin Philharmonic in a production of Verdi's "Requiem" under the baton of Claudio Abbado. In 2002, he sang the title role in "Boris Godunov" with Opéra Bastille and the role of Fiesco in "Simon Boccanegra" with the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. In 2003 he sang the role of Boris again at the Grand Théâtre de Genève and the role of Padre Guardiano in Verdi's "La forza del destino" at Carnegie Hall in New York City. That same year his recording of Ralph Vaughan Williams's "Sea Symphony" with Robert Spano, Christine Goerke, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra won a Grammy Award. In 2004 he made his Metropolitan Opera debut as Sparafucile in Verdi's "Rigoletto", a role he later recorded that year at the Liceu. In 2005 he performed the role of Roger in Verdi's "Jérusalem" with conductor Paolo Olmi conducts the Netherlands Radio Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
Konstantinov has spent much of his career singing roles with the Sofia National Opera where he has appeared as Mephistopheles in Gounod's "Faust", Raimondo in Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor", Count Walter in Verdi's "Luisa Miller", Sparafucile in Verdi's "Rigoletto", Fiesco in Verdi's "Simon Boccanegra", Sarastro in Mozart's "Die Zauberflöte", both Don Pedro and the title role in Mozart's "Don Giovanni", and as Timur in Puccini's "Turandot" among other roles.
Family.
Konstantinov's younger brother, Plamen Konstantinov, is a former volleyball player and captain of the Bulgaria men's national volleyball team and last played for Iraklis VC in the Greek A1 Volleyball League.
Controversy.
On May 20, 2012, Konstantinov allegedly has assaulted a Bulgarian journalist, Kiril Hristov, after seeing the latter turning up his SUV's wipers. Mr. Hristov apparently did this as a protest for having Konstantinov's car improperly parked. The incident gained fast publicity among the Bulgarian online community. Both Mr. Hristov and Mr. Konstantinov wrote their versions of what happened.

Saxotromba

The saxotromba is a valved brasswind instrument invented by the Belgian instrument-maker Adolphe Sax around 1844. It was designed for the mounted bands of the French military, probably as a substitute for the French horn. The saxotrombas comprised a family of half-tube instruments of different pitches. By about 1867 the saxotromba was no longer being used by the French military, but specimens of various sizes continued to be manufactured until the early decades of the twentieth century, during which time the instrument made sporadic appearances in the opera house, both in the pit and on stage. The instrument is often confused with the closely related saxhorn.
The technical specifications of the saxotromba and the original constitution of its family are not known with any certainty. Initially, the instrument had the same vertical design as its close relation the saxhorn, with the bell pointing upwards, though later models of both families were designed with bells that faced forwards ("pavillon tournant"). The mouthpiece was cup-shaped, and the bore was conical, being probably intermediate between the cylindrical bore of the natural trumpet and the conical bore of the natural horn; the taper was slower than that of the saxhorns and cornets.
The name of the instrument combines Sax's surname with the Italian word for "trumpet" ("tromba"). In Germany the instrument is known by the name Saxtromba; in France the term "saxotromba" is generally applied to another close relative, the Wagner tuba.
History.
The saxotromba was invented by Adolphe Sax at his workshop on the Rue Saint-Georges in Paris in the early 1840s. On 13 October 1845, Sax applied for a patent "for a family of cylinder instruments called saxotrombas, intermediate between the saxhorn and the cylinder trumpet." The cylinders referred to in the patent application were piston valves which allowed the player to lower the pitch of the instrument's natural or open harmonics by one or more semitones. In 1843 Sax had patented his own version of the Berlin piston valve (i.e. the "Berliner Pumpenventil", which had been invented independently by Heinrich Stölzel in 1827 and Wilhelm Friedrich Wieprecht in 1833). These were independent valves, which were not designed to be used in combination with one another, though the intonational problems that arose when they were so used could often be corrected by the player's technique. This was especially true in the case of the higher-pitched half-tube instruments, which were usually provided with just three valves, allowing the player to lower the pitch of any open note by one, two or three semitones when the valves were used one at a time, or by four, five or six semitones when the valves were used in combination. Before the invention of compensating valves (which could be used in combination without producing faulty intonation), lower-pitched instruments generally required extra valves in order to lower the pitch of an open note by more than three semitones.
On 22 November 1845 Sax was granted French Patent 2306 for a "Musical instrument, called the saxotromba, whose principles of construction may by means of slight modifications, be applied to saxhorns, cornets, trumpets, and trombones". The saxotromba was also included in another of Sax's patents, "Brevet d'invention 8351" of 5 May 1849. This patent was amended on 20 August 1849 and again on 23 April 1852. In these patents, Sax defined the saxotrombas in three different ways. However, the constitution of the saxotromba family was never fixed, as Sax continued to introduce new sizes of instrument in the final two decades of his life, modifying the design of the instrument as he did so. Some of his latest models had as many as six independent valves, thus obviating the need to use them in combination.
There is little agreement as to the actual number of saxotromba models that were ever made, this number varying from source to source from as few as three to as many as nine. The oldest surviving specimen of saxotromba dates from 1849, a three-valved instrument now in the Basel Historical Museum, while the youngest surviving example is a six-valved instrument from 1864 now in the Musée de la Musique in Paris. After Sax's death, his son Adolphe Edouard continued to manufacture saxotrombas into the twentieth century; an undated model at the Museum of Musical Instruments, Theatre and Cinematography in Saint Petersburg is thought to have been manufactured sometime between 1895 and 1907.
Throughout this period the saxotromba made occasional appearances in the opera houses of France, especially in the onstage "banda" at the Paris Opéra, of which Sax was musical director from 1847 until 1892. The saxotromba was also at this time a regular member of many brass bands throughout Europe, though the instrument disappeared from the inventories of the French military in 1867.
Sources.
"The saxo-tromba is a new instrument invented by Ad. Sax. This instrument is made of brass; it is equipped with a system of piston valves and has a cup-shaped mouthpiece. The timbre of the saxo-tromba resembles somewhat that of both the saxhorn and the trumpet; but it is less sombre than the former and less strident than the latter."
"These are brass instruments with mouth-piece, and with three, four, or five cylinders, like the Their tube, being more contracted, gives to the sound which it produces, a character more shrill, partaking at once of the quality of tone of the trumpet and of that of the bugle. The number of the members of the family of saxotrombas equals that of sax-horns. They are disposed in the same order, from high to low, and possess the same compass."
"A valve instrument of the trumpet family having a narrow tube and the quality of whose tone is less delicate than that of the horn and more refined than that of the saxhorn. It is found in seven sizes: soprano; sopranino; alto; tenor; bass; low bass, and contrabass.
The saxotromba family.
Writing in his "Treatise on Instrumentation" in 1855, Berlioz stated unequivocally that the number of saxotrombas was equal to the number of saxhorns, which he set at nine. Sax's patent application for the saxhorns (1845), however, only included five instruments, the other members being added in the 1850s. The original family comprised a soprano in 3' E, an alto in 4' B, a tenor in 7' E, a baritone in 9' B, and a bass in 9' B. The latter two instruments were of the same size, pitch and compass, differing only in bore.
If, as Berlioz stated, the saxotromba family corresponded in number, size and range to the family of saxhorns, then it would appear that there were originally four different sizes of the instrument: a soprano in 3' E, an alto in 4' B, a tenor in 7' E, and a bass in 9' B (though, once again, these may have been referred to by other names).
Kastner (1848) includes an image of seven different sizes of saxotromba, all of them with vertical bells:
Of the five original saxhorns, only the bass was a whole-tube instrument capable of sounding its fundamental tone (or first harmonic). The narrower bore of the saxotrombas, however, meant that all members of this family were half-tube instruments (like the trumpets and cornets), whose natural downward ranges extended only as far as the second harmonic.
Acoustic principles.
The saxotromba was a half-tube brasswind instrument. It was constructed in such a way that the column of air inside the instrument was capable of vibrating at a number of different pitches that corresponded to the notes of the harmonic series. These pitches are known as the instrument's natural or normal modes of vibration, each one being a natural harmonic or open note. By vibrating his lips at the correct frequency, the player is able to compel the instrument's air column to vibrate at the correct pitch; by lipping, he can correct the minor intonational defects that inevitably arise on account of the discrepancies between the natural harmonic series and the tempered scales of classical music.
Like the modern valve trumpet and cornet, the saxotromba employed harmonics two through eight. Being a half-tube instrument, the fundamental or first harmonic was not available on the saxotromba. Harmonics higher than the eighth were certainly feasible, but it is unlikely that military musicians would ever have been required to venture above the eighth harmonic. The seventh harmonic was too much out of tune to be lipped; this partial was generally avoided by trumpeters and cornet players after the introduction of valves.
In order to provide a saxotromba with a chromatic compass from the second harmonic upwards, it is essential to provide the player with some means of lowering the pitch of the third harmonic by as many as six semitones, this being the size of the gap between the second and third harmonics. Three independent valves will reduce the pitch of a natural or open harmonic by two, one and three semitones respectively. Used singly or in combination, these can bridge the gap between the second and third harmonics, though the player will be required to correct by lipping the faulty intonation produced when independent valves are used in combination. The gaps between the higher harmonics are smaller still, so no more than three valves are required to provide a saxotromba with a full chromatic compass; this is true even if the seventh harmonic is not used.
Furthermore, by using all three valves in combination while overblowing the second harmonic, the player can extend the lower end of the instrument's compass downwards by six semitones to a note three whole tones below the second harmonic:
Presumably the fourth valve, where present, would have lowered the pitch of an open note by a perfect fourth, or five semitones, removing the need to use certain faulty combinations of the first three valves. In the early nineteenth century, when four valves were applied to a half-tube instrument they generally lowered the pitch of a natural harmonic by two, one, three and five semitones respectively. Berlioz notes that in the case of "an instrument "with four cylinders", the chromatic compass of the low part of this instrument no longer stops at the F# [a tritone below the second harmonic but goes down to the first C the written fundamental". He notes, however, that the "first low note of the tube's resonance ... is too bad to be employed". This would seem to imply that the fourth valve of the saxotromba did indeed lower the pitch of a given harmonic by 5 semitones, so that all four valves in combination would lower an open note by a major seventh. It is doubtful, however, whether four independent valves were ever used in combination to produce such low notes.
The fifth valve, where present, probably lowered the pitch of an open harmonic by 6 semitones. Later models of saxotromba were provided with six independent valves, lowering the pitch of an open harmonic by one through six semitones, thus removing completely the need to use any valves in combination.
Compass.
Like the saxhorn, the saxotromba was a transposing instrument. Its music was always written in the treble clef as though for an instrument pitched in 4' C, but the actual sounds produced depended on the size of instrument used. For example, if a piece of music were performed on a soprano saxotromba in 3' E, it would sound a minor third higher than written.
In the following table, all possible saxotrombas mentioned in the literature have been included with their probable ranges, even those whose existence is in doubt; the four in bold are probably the original models of 1845. I have followed Forsysth (1914), who restricted the compass of all the saxhorns to harmonics two through eight, and set the lower end of the compass of the half-tube saxhorns a tritone below the second harmonic. Several other sources imply that the ninth and tenth harmonics were also in regular use (on some models, at least), extending the upper range by two whole-tones. I have assumed that all of the saxotrombas - even the contrabass models, if they ever existed - were half-tube instruments. It should be remembered that the fundamentals (shown here at their sounding pitches) were not available:
Richard Wagner and the saxotromba.
In November 1853, the German composer Richard Wagner began the composition of the first of his "Ring" operas, "Das Rheingold". A few days later he drafted a provisional list of the musical instruments he intended to use in the work. It was written on one side of a sheet of paper the other side of which contained an early draft of the opera's opening scene. This list includes the following items:
In October of the same year Wagner had paid a visit to Adolphe Sax's workshop on the Rue St Georges in Paris, where he had seen several new instruments, including the saxhorns and saxotrombas. Wagner must have felt that the saxhorns would make suitable adjuncts to the large complement of horns he intended to use in the "Ring", as their appearance in the list of instruments in parenthesis after the "8 Hörner" clearly indicates that he originally intended four of his horn players to double on them.
As for the "Saxtromp", this is clearly an abbreviation of "Saxtrompete", Wagner's German translation of "saxotromba". It seems clear, then, that Wagner's original plan was to use a saxotromba as the bass member of his trumpet group; but between then and 1876, when the "Ring" was given its premiere, Wagner fell out with Sax and altered his plans more than once. In the event, the three trumpets were supported by a bass trumpet designed especially for the occasion by the instrument maker C. W. Moritz.
Nevertheless, we can deduce that one of the early saxotrombas was pitched in E, was equipped with four piston valves, and had a compass that was presumably capable of playing the bass trumpet part in "Das Rheingold" (which is notated throughout for an instrument in E, sounding a major sixth lower than written). This latter covers almost two-and-a-half octaves from sounding C3 (one octave below middle C) to G5 (at the top of the treble clef). This four-valved saxotromba in E presumably corresponded to the tenor saxhorn, whose sounding range according to Berlioz ran from A2 to G5, thus encompassing the bass trumpet part in "Das Rheingold". The top note, however, would have been produced by overblowing the tenth harmonic (sounding G5) while engaging the second valve (lowering the open note by one semitone to G5).
Extant saxotrombas.
Of the many saxotrombas manufactured by Adolphe Sax's firm, only half a dozen are known to have survived to the present day. The following table also includes three instruments of unknown location which may no longer be extant:

The temple is in the middle of a huge ground where the Chinakkathoor pooram is conducted ever year. There are two shrines namely 'thazhekkavu'and 'melekkavu'. The upper shrine, 'melekkavu' is believed to be older than the lower shrine, 'thazhekkavu'. The preists of the upper shrine traditionally come from the 'kuLangara nair' family of Palappuram. Namboothiri preists do the pujas in the lower shrine and in the ten days of Pooram, they will be in charge of the upper shrine as well. 
Chinakkathoor Pooram.
Chinakkathoor Festival is celebrated every year in February-March(makam naal of kumbham).
The highlight of the evening festivities is a grand procession of 33 tuskers. Traditional performances of the Panchavadyam or the temple orchestra and various other art forms like Vellattu, Theyyam, Poothanum thirayum, Kaalavela, Kuthiravela, Aandi Vedan, Karivela, and so on are shown. The Tholppavakkoothu, a ritualistic shadow puppet show, is performed at the temple premises every evening for the 17 days preceding the concluding festival. The festival starts with kuthira (horse) game and ends next day with Theru(Ratham),a beautiful sight is the decoration of theru(Ratham) by Palappuram, and the procession of sixteen well-decorated 16 models of the kuthira (horse) and the kaala (bull) brought ceremoniously to the temple by devotees.

Lyon School

The Lyon School is a term for a group of French artists which gathered around Paul Chenavard. It was founded by Pierre Revoil, one of the representatives of the Troubadour style. It included Victor Orsel, Louis Janmot and Hippolyte Flandrin, and was nicknamed "the prison of painting" by Charles Baudelaire. It was principally inspired by philosophical-moral and religious themes, and as a current was closely related to the British Pre-Raphaelite painters and poets.
Recognized at the Salon of 1819, the school was consecrated 16 February 1851 by the creation of the gallery of painters from Lyon ("galerie des Artistes lyonnais") at the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.
Between 1890 and 1909 a younger generation of artists of divers inspirations would become associated with L'École de Lyon (or École lyonnaise) exhibiting at the "Le Salon" in Lyon (Salon de la Société Lyonnaise des Beaux-Arts): artists such as Joanny Arlin, Philippe Audras, Jean Bardon, Alexandre Baudin, André Baudin, Camille Bouvagne, Marguerite Brun, Jean Chorel, Anna Dugoin, Marie Saubiez-Euler, Pierre Euler, Etienne Exbrayat, Horace Fonville, Marie Giron, Georges Glaise, Gustave Karcher, Marthe Koch, Théodore Lévigne, Jules Medard, Hugues Méray, Alphonse Muscat, Henry Oberkampff, Edouard Paupin, Victor-Philippe Flipsen (Philipsen), Louis Piot, Henri Ray, Henri Raynaud, Ernest Roman, Glaudius Seignol, Gabriel Trévoux, and Louis Vollen.

Railways in Norfolk

Railways have played an important part in the history and development of the English county of Norfolk. It currently has thirty open National Rail stations, though there were once well over a hundred.
Between 1959 and 1970 much of the network was closed, including more than two thirds of Norfolk's railway stations, several main lines and most of the branch lines - leaving only a core network in place. 
Several of the former routes have been re-opened as heritage lines such as the North Norfolk Railway and the Mid-Norfolk Railway.
History.
Arrival of the railway.
The railway first arrived in Norfolk in 1845 with a major extension of an existing line from London which previously had stopped short of Cambridge at Bishop's Stortford. The extension had been built in sections by three different companies: the Northern & Eastern Railway (N&ER) — Bishop's Stortford to Newport; the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) — Newport through Cambridge to Brandon); and the Norwich & Brandon Railway (N&B) — Brandon via Wymondham to Norwich. However, the ECR had already held on lease the N&ER's line from Stratford to Bishop's Stortford, and it continued to operate all the services over the expanded route, whose parts were opened simultaneously. Its original terminus was at Trowse on the outskirts of Norwich.
In 1849 this route was joined by the Eastern Union Railway (EUR) line from Haughley to Norwich, extending its own lines from Colchester via Ipswich, creating a new terminus at Norwich Victoria. This route is now the Great Eastern Main Line. Journey times to the capital were shorter on this route, and it soon became very profitable. 
King's Lynn had been linked to the country's growing railway network in 1846, and in 1862 the line was extended on to Hunstanton.
Expansion of the network.
The creation of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, a combined venture between the Midland railway and the Great Northern Railway merged several smaller schemes into a larger proposal of creating a new main line from the Midlands into Norfolk.
The M&GNR created a hub at Melton Constable, which served as a junction for the route with lines heading west to the Midlands, north to Cromer, south to Norwich and east towards Great Yarmouth as well as housing a major engineering works.
In the late Victorian era with the new waves of holiday passengers during the summer months, and the increased routes for cross-Britain trade, Norfolk boomed thanks to the new rail network.
Despite this some stations such as Bluestone railway station and Starston railway station closed shortly after opening, as traffic was considered too low to justify keeping them open. Other schemes, such as a proposed branch line extension to Blakeney, were dropped when they appeared uneconomical.
Groupings and Nationalisation.
In 1923 the Railways Act 1921 came into force which resulted in British railways being merged into four main companies. Much of the county's routes came under the control of the London and North Eastern Railway, though the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway maintained its independence, and remained one of the few routes outside of the new system.
In 1947, all British rail companies were nationalised and Britain's railways came under state control. Until 1997 all of Norfolk's stations were under the control of British Rail.
Beeching Axe.
A number of the cuts to the Norfolk network predated the Beeching Axe by several years. In 1959 the Main Line of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway was closed, on economic grounds. Essential maintenance work was considered too much to be justified. 
As car ownership increased, the need for rural routes was considered lessened, and the least profitable were screened for closure in order to save money. Beeching issued a report in 1962, recommending that a large number of stations and lines be closed. 
In Norfolk, on the principal routes, such as the Great Eastern Main Line, a number of the intermediate stations at small rural towns and villages were closed, to speed up journey times. Smaller branch lines like the Waveney Valley Line were closed completely. 
Many of the former trackbeds were tuned into pathways such as Marriots Way, which remain open to cyclists and pedestrians. Many of the former stations were converted for private use.
A few routes managed to survive the initial cuts, such as the line between Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth which survived until 1970. The Bittern Line was not proposed for closure, and stayed open. But King's Lynn-Hunstanton and King's Lynn-Dereham-Wymondham closed despite not being proposed for closure in the Report. 
A second report by Beeching had proposed even more severe cuts to the East Anglia rail network, leaving only the Main Line into Norwich, but it was rejected by the government.
Heritage railways.
Norfolk is home to several Heritage railways and preserved stations.
North Norfolk Railway.
The North Norfolk Railway operates a five mile route between Holt and Sheringham on the Norfolk coast. It was preserved in 1964, and the extension to Holt opened in 1987.
Mid-Norfolk Railway.
The Mid-Norfolk Railway operates an eleven and a half mile route between Dereham and Wymondham Abbey. A further six mile extension to County School railway station is planned. It is also proposed to connect services with the National Rail main line at Wymondham railway station.
Bure Valley Railway.
The Bure Valley Railway is a 15 inch gauge railway that runs for nine miles between Aylsham and Wroxham.
Wells and Walsingham Light Railway.
The Wells and Walsingham is a 10¼ in gauge railway which runs for four miles from Wells-next-the-Sea to Walsingham.
Existing network.
There are currently thirty working National Rail stations in Norfolk. Most of the major towns and settlements are served by trains. Norwich railway station is the busiest station, being used by around two and a half million passengers a year. The network is currently administered by Network Rail: services in the east of the county are mainly provided by Greater Anglia with regional services by East Midlands Trains; and in the west by First Capital Connect with a weekday peak-hours commuting service by Greater Anglia.
Future.
The Norfolk Orbital Railway is a proposal to link the Mid-Norfolk Railway and the North Norfolk Railway to create a line running from Sheringham to Wymondham, restoring regular services to Fakenham and Melton Constable.
In 2008 Hunstanton Council considered a proposal to re-open the line from King's Lynn, but decided against it.

Boloria frigga

The Frigga Fritillary ("Boloria frigga" or "Clossiana frigga") is a butterfly of the family Nymphalidae with a circumboreal distribution. It occurs in bogs and tundra in Northern Europe to the north of 60° N, very locally in more southern locations, as well as in the Urals, Siberia, Northern Mongolia, the Russian Far East, western parts of the United States and Canada. Larvae feed on "Rubus chamaemorus", "Vaccinium oxycoccos" and occasionally on "Vaccinium uliginosum". In experimentation they accept "Polygonum viviparum" and "Rubus fruticosus". The species produces one generation every two years.

Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework

The Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework (EAAF) is created by the US Federal government Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to allow federal agencies to assess and report their enterprise architecture activity and maturity, and to advance the use of enterprise architecture in the federal government.
The version 2.2 of the framework was released in October 2007, and version 3.1 in June 2009.
Overview.
The OMB Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework (the Framework) helps OMB and the agencies assess the capability of enterprise architecture programs to guide IT investments. It also helps to better understand the current state of an agency’s EA, and assists them in integrating it into their decision-making processes. By applying the assessment themselves, agencies can identify strengths and weaknesses within their programs and adjust them accordingly.
Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework (EAAF) version 3.1 identifies the measurement areas and criteria by which agencies are expected to use the EA to drive performance improvements that result in the following outcomes:
While agencies have clearly demonstrated a degree of maturity and competency in developing and using their EAs, EAAF seeks to advance the practice of EA, particularly through the development and use of agency segment architectures, aimed at driving the kinds of government-wide outcomes.
Performance Improvement Lifecycle.
Government agencies are continually assessing current performance, identifying opportunities for improvement, and translating them into specific actions. Enterprise architecture is an integrated management practice that maximizes the use of an agency’s resources to achieve their goals. Architecture describes the pathway from strategic goals and objectives, through investments, to measurable performance improvements for the entire enterprise or a portion.
Continuous performance improvement is the principal driver connecting EA program staff with key business stakeholders across each phase of the Performance Improvement Lifecycle. Agency Chief Architects and EA program staff:
Opportunities to improve mission performance are prioritized in terms of their relative value to the agency’s strategic goals and objectives in the enterprise transition plan (ETP) and segment architecture.
Architect.
Enterprise architecture describes the current (baseline) and future (target) states of the agency, and the plan to transition from the current to the future state, with a focus on agency strategy, program performance improvements and information technology investments. Agency EAs are organized by segments – core mission areas (e.g., homeland security, health), business service (e.g., financial management, human resources), and enterprise services (e.g., Information Sharing). Segments are defined using the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) reference models .
Invest.
Performance improvement opportunities identified during the “Architect” process are ideally addressed through an agency portfolio of IT investments. This step defines the implementation and funding strategy for individual initiatives in the Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP) and described in the segment architectures. Program management plans are created to implement the individual solutions.
Implement.
Projects are executed and tracked throughout the system development life cycle (SDLC). Achievement of the program / project plan within acceptable variance for schedule and budget is measured and reported through Earned Value Management (EVM) process.
Measure, assess and improve.
Information and information technology, as critical enablers of program performance improvements, must be assessed and evaluated in the context of agency missions and outcome-oriented results defined in the enterprise-wide performance architecture.
Performance improvement plans and priorities, including those previously gathered under the PART and Performance Assessment Report (PAR) programs, are reflected in the agency EA, particularly the performance architecture and ETP. Performance metrics previously gathered are used to evaluate the results in agency performance improvement plans, identifying a program’s strengths and weaknesses and addressing ways to improve the program performance.
Agency submission data quality.
OMB collects a significant amount of IT investment data and other related data from executive agencies during each phase of Performance Improvement Lifecycle. OMB uses the information for development of an IT investment portfolio as a part of the President’s budget request to Congress.

Alfred Michael &quot;Chief&quot; Venne

Alfred Michael Venne (1879–1971) was an Ojibwa (Chippewa) Native American. He was educated at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Pennsylvania. He later became an educator, athletic manager and coach, administrator and mentor to countless young men.
Early life.
Alfred M. Venne was born near Leroy, Pembina County, Dakota Territory, in 1879. His Native American name was Soangetaha (Fiero: "Zoongide'e", "Strong Hearted"). After early education at local Indian Schools, Alfred entered Carlisle in 1899. He was an excellent football and baseball player under their famous Coach Glenn S. “Pop” Warner. Venne graduated from Carlisle in the class of 1904. Warner coached Carlisle 1899-1903 and 1907-1914. The 1904-06 football teams were Indian coached with great success by Eddy Rodgers and Bemus Pierce, both former Carlisle All-Americans. Upon his graduation, Alfred was highly regarded and retained on staff at Carlisle as an athletic trainer and coach. His extraordinary skills were also utilized as football team business manager, band manager, museum curator, and photography lab instructor and manager. He was a member of a group from Carlisle which took part in the President Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Parade in March, 1905 in Washington D.C., at which time he met and became friends with the great Apache War Chief Geronimo. The legendary Jim Thorpe arrived at Carlisle in 1904 at age 16. He had played baseball, ran track, etc., but had not played football. Alfred trained and coached Thorpe in several sports and was instrumental in preparing him to play football in 1907 when Pop Warner returned to Carlisle from Cornell as head coach.
Family.
Alfred was the son of Michel Venne, an Ojibwa tribal chief and farmer. After graduation from Carlisle, Alfred married Sarah Williams, a Seneca from New York. She was also a Carlisle graduate and trained as a nurse. They had a son, Alfred M. Venne, Jr. (1908–1939), who died from TB after a long illness in Missouri.They also had a daughter victoria haskell venne.
Later life.
Alfred was transferred from Carlisle to the Chilocco Indian School, Oklahoma in 1909, where he served briefly. He then spent a number of years as Athletic Manager and Coach at Haskell Indian Institute in Kansas, and later worked as a YMCA Director. He retired in 1946 as Athletic Director at the Kansas City Athletic Club. He then moved to Austin, Texas and worked for the Capitol Area Council of boy scouts serving as Ranger at Camp Tom Wooten. He also developed the Tonkawa Lodge Indian Dance Group. In late 1953, Chief Venne relocated to Sebastopol, California, and continued to be involved with several boy scout councils. Chief Venne died in January, 1971 in California at the age of 91. He had cherished his Carlisle experience, with the belief that his people needed to become educated and assimilate into American society. He was proud of his Native American roots, embraced his culture and remained a devout Christian during his entire life.

Fred Martinez explained to his family that he didn’t want to have to choose between being a boy or a girl–that he wanted to be both. Fred self-identified as a gay male and commonly used the name Fred, as well as “F.C.” He also expressed a feminine aspect of himself in the way he dressed and presented himself, and sometimes wanted to be called Beyoncé, in honor of his favorite singer.
Martinez was a student at Montezuma-Cortez High School in Cortez, Colorado, when one evening, he was attacked and beaten to death by 18-year old Shaun Murphy. Murphy was at a party, visiting with friends at Cortez, Colorado, where he met Martinez, in violation of parole conditions, since Murphy had a juvenile criminal record.
Martinez' decomposed body was found 21 June, five days after his disappearance, in a desert canyon on the edge of Cortez, known as "The Pits". Murphy was caught disposing of bloody clothing in Farmington, New Mexico. He was held on $500,000 bail.
She was featured in the documentary Two Spirits
2002.
Gwen Araujo of Newark, California (died October 2002), an American teenage trans woman, was killed by four men, two of whom she had consensual sexual actions with, who beat and strangled her after discovering she was anatomically male. Two of the defendants were convicted of second-degree murder, but not convicted on the requested hate crime enhancements. The other two defendants pleaded guilty or no contest to voluntary manslaughter. In at least one of the trials, a trans panic defense - an extension of the gay panic defense - was employed.
2003.

2007.
Roberto González Onrubia died on 1 September in Madrid, Spain, from a beating he received on 29 August. This was the culmination of a nine-month period during which Dolores de los Reyes Navarro and Ainhoa Nogales Bergantiños made him a prisoner in his own home and inflicted torture, including physical abuse and sexual humiliation, on him. The two women were found guilty in 2010.
Ruby Ordenana was a transgender sex worker who was found dead on 16 March. An autopsy showed that she had been strangled to death. Police believe that DNA evidence shows that her murderer is a man who raped and assaulted two other transgender people.
Erika Keels (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 3/22/07) Erika, a 20-year-old black transgender woman, was murdered on 22 March 2007, on North Broad Street in Philadelphia. Witnesses saw an assailant eject Erika from her car and intentionally run her over four times, killing her and leaving the scene. A medical examiner’s report supports these eyewitness accounts. But police ruled Erika’s death an accident and have refused to conduct an investigation. The driver, Roland Button, was later apprehended, but he has yet to face criminal charges–including “hit and run” charges. When Ms. Keels’ friends, who are themselves trans, questioned police officials about the classification of her death as an accident, they were asked to disclose their “birth” names and told they were “trying to make something out of nothing.” 
Dana A. Larkin, 26, was a black trans woman who was murdered while working as a prostitute in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
2008.
Sanesha Stewart was a 25-year-old trans woman living in the Bronx, New York, who was stabbed to death on 10 February 2008. An ex-convict was arrested for the murder. Police reported that he had visited her for sex and became enraged over the realization that she was not a cisgender woman. Stewart's murder, initially reported by the "New York Daily News" as "Fooled John Stabbed Bronx Tranny", outraged transgender activists for the act as well as the reporting in the media. A neighbor denied the police's assertion she was a prostitute. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) intervened to inform the "Daily News" that "tranny" is often considered pejorative and dehumanizing and that insinuating Stewart "fooled" her murderer was both defamatory and irresponsible. The paper dropped both "tranny" and "fooled" in follow-up stories and changed the online version of the original report to address the concerns raised.
Larry King of Oxnard, California, was a gay or bisexual 15-year-old eighth-grade student who was shot to death at his school on 12 February 2008. He wore gender variant clothes, jewelry and make-up and had come out as gay at school. King was bullied and teased by his fellow students due to his effeminacy and openness about being gay, having come out at ten-years-old and while in the third grade. On the morning of 12 February, Lawrence was in the school’s computer lab with 24 other students. Fellow student, fourteen-year-old Brandon McInerney was witnessed repeatedly looking at King during the class. At 8:15 a.m, McInerney shot King twice in the head using a handgun. King was declared brain dead the next day but kept on a ventilator to preserve his organs for donation. Prosecutors charged McInerney as an adult with murder as a premeditated hate crime and gun possession. The crime was reputed to be the most high-profile hate crime case of 2008. "Newsweek" described it as "the most prominent gay-bias crime since the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard", bringing attention to issues of gun violence as well as gender expression and sexual identity of teenagers. On 21 November 2011 McInerney pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and use of a firearm. He will receive 21 years behind bars, with no credit given for time served prior to the trial and no credit will be given for good behavior. He will initially serve his sentence in a juvenile facility and then be transferred to prison upon turning 18.
Duanna Johnson, a 40-year-old African American transgender woman. In February 2008, Duanna was picked up and arrested by Memphis, Tennessee, police officers Bridges McRae and J. Swain. She was pinned down and beaten by the two men in a Memphis police jail after she refused to respond to anti-gay and anti-transgender slurs. The assault was captured on video, which aired on several regional newscasts. In an interview given to FOX 13, Duanna spoke about her experiences. “As McRae was calling me, he said ‘hey he-she, come over here’” Johnson told FOX 13 reporters, “I knew he couldn’t be talking to me because that’s not my name.” Duanna Johnson received national media attention this past June when she went public about the brutality she suffered at the hands of two Memphis Police Officers. She became “the public face of our community’s campaign against racism, homophobia, and transphobia” according to a statement from the Mid-South Peace and Justice Center. On Monday 10 November, according to news reports, Duanna was shot “execution style” between Hollywood and Staten Avenue in Memphis, Tenn.
Felicia Melton-Smyth, a 41-year-old transwoman, was stabbed to death on 26 May 2008 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. She was vacationing with a group of 20 people from Madison, Wisconsin. Francisco Javier Hoyos Reyes was arrested immediately afterwards.
Angie Zapata was a trans woman who was murdered on 17 July 2008, in Greeley, Colorado. Her death was the first ever case involving a transgender victim to be ruled a hate crime. Colorado is one of only eleven states that protect transgender victims under hate crime laws in the United States. Allen Andrade, who learned eighteen-year-old Angie was transgender after meeting her and spending several days with her, beat her to death with a fire extinguisher. In his arrest affidavit, Andrade calls Zapata "it", and during his trial a tape was played of a phone conversation in which he told his girl friend "gay things need to die".

Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon

The Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon ( "Musée des beaux-arts de Lyon") is a municipal museum of fine arts in the French city of Lyon. It is housed near place des Terreaux in a former Benedictine convent of the 17th and 18th centuries. It was restored between 1988 and 1998, and despite these important restoration works it remained open to visitors. Its collections range from ancient Egypt antiquities to the Modern art period and make the museum one of the most important in Europe. It hosts important exhibitions of art : recently there have been exhibitions of works by Georges Braque and Henri Laurens (second half of 2005), then one on the work of Théodore Géricault (April to July 2006).
Buildings.
Abbey.
Until 1792, the buildings belonged to the royal abbaye des Dames de Saint-Pierre, built in the 17th century. The abbess always came from the high French nobility and here received the personalities of the kingdom. The institution had a particularly aristocratic slant, as is shown by its renovation by Louis XIV of France in the 17th and 18th centuries. The present state of the palais Saint-Pierre is largely down to these renovations, which included the construction of the baroque refectory and monumental honour-staircase, said to be by Thomas Blanchet. The refectory has been renovated since then and now serves as the reception for group visits, as well as housing two monumental paintings on the subject of dining, "The Multiplication of the Loaves" and "The Last Supper", both by Pierre-Louis Cretey. The rest of its current scheme was designed by Nicolas Bidaut and Simon Guillaume and is made up of sculptures.
The Palais du commerce et des Arts.
The expulsion of the nuns and the destruction of the église Saint-Saturnin date to the French Revolution, though the abbey's other church (the église Saint-Pierre) still exists and now houses 19th and 20th century sculptures. After the Revolution the remaining buildings housed the Palais du Commerce et des Arts, at first made up of works confiscated from the clergy and nobility but later becoming more multi-disciplinary. For example, it gained archaeology and natural history collections and those of the Académie des Sciences et des Lettres. The imperial drawing school was created in 1805 in the Palais du Commerce et des Arts to provide Lyon's silk factories with designers. It gave birth to the famous Lyon School. In 1860, the Chambre de Commerce left the Palais Saint-Pierre and the establishment became the Palais des Arts. From 1875, the museum's collections underwent a major expansion and had to be expanded - the staircase by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes dates to this era.
The Musée des Beaux-Arts.
The start of the 20th century was marked by a considerable opening-up of the collections, leading to the Palais des Arts becoming the Musée des Beaux-Arts. After several restoration projects, it was in the mid-1990s that the building acquired its present scheme.
Collections.
Paintings.
The paintings department has European paintings of 14th- to mid-20th-century paintings. They are arranged chronologically and by major schools in 35 rooms. The collection features : 
Sculptures.
At the heart of the abbey's former cloister is now a municipal garden, right in the centre of the town, on the peninsula. It is decorated with several 19th century's statues:
The main part of the collection is displayed in two divided sections : at the ground floor for Medieval and Renaissance sculptures and in the old baroque refectory, which has been renovated, for 19th and early 20th centuries sculptures.
Antiquities.
Egypt.
Ancient Egypt is the main theme of the museum's antiquities department, due to the historic importance of egyptology in Lyon, animated by men like Victor Loret, whose family gave over 1000 objects to the museum in 1954. From 1895, the musée du Louvre provided nearly 400 objects (unguent vases, funerary figurines etc.) to form the foundation of the department; other objects (canopic vases, jewellery, material from Antinopolis) were later added to complement this initial donation, and were augmented in 1936 by objects from the artisans' village of Deir el-Medina.
The highlights of the collection are its display of sarcophaguses and the gates of Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV from the temple of Medamud dug by the Lyons archaeologist Alexandre Varille in 1939. The rest of the objects throw light on everyday life in ancient Egypt.
The collection has 600 works displayed in 9 rooms, in a thematic and chronological sequence:
Near East and Middle East.
One room contains cylinder seals, clay tablets and bas-reliefs from the Sumerian, Assyrian and Babylonian civilisations, as well as Luristan bronzes, ceramics and statuettes from Cyprus and a fine collection of Syrian objects (including an anthropoid sarcophagus and a marble bas-relief).
Ancient Greece and Italy.
A single room is devoted to the main work in this department, the 6th century BC marble kore from the Acropolis of Athens. A second room is dedicated to ancient Greece, containing a series of Attic vases in black-figure or red-figure, bronzes and terracotta Tanagra figurines. Finally, a small room is devoted to Magna Graecia, with many ceramics and bronze helmets.
Roman sculpture is also presented across several rooms - marble statues (a torso of Venus, a child on a cockerel, statues of draped figures etc.) and also small bronze figurines of divinities (Mercury, Venus, Mars etc.) and everyday objects.
Objets d’Art.
This department's collection ranges from the Middle Ages to the 20th century and includes:
Coins and medals.
Lyon's "médaillier" is the second largest one in France after that in Paris, with nearly 50,000 coins, medals, seals and other objects. It is known at a European level and has held a prominent place in the numismatic world from its beginnings in the 19th century to recent discoveries of the treasuries of the Terreaux and the Célestins.
Graphic arts.
This department was created at the start of the 19th century and includes works on paper - drawings, prints, engravings, watercolours etc. - based on line rather than colour. In all it more than 8,000 works, including ones by Filippino Lippi, Parmigianino, Fra Bartolomeo, Leonetto Cappiello, Nicolas Poussin, François Boucher, Ingres, Théodore Géricault, Eugène Delacroix, Camille Corot, Honoré Daumier, Odilon Redon, Puvis de Chavannes, Edgar Degas, Henri Matisse, Fernand Léger and a remarkable study by Albrecht Dürer.
Magazine.
On the initiative of René Jullian, in 1952 the "Bulletin des musées lyonnais" was created, and 8 years later changed its name to "Bulletin des musées et monuments Lyonnais". In 2003 it changed to an annual publication and again changed its name, to "Cahiers du musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon".

Raoul Weil

Raoul Weil (b. 13 November 1959) is a Swiss banker who currently serves as chief executive of the Swiss private bank Reuss Private Group. Weil is best known as being the former chairman and chief executive officer of Global Wealth Management & Business Banking at UBS AG. Weil eventually became a member of UBS's Group Executive Board.
Under Weil's management, UBS became embroiled in the 2008-09 U.S. tax evasion controversy, which led to Weil being fired after he was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department for aiding and abetting tax evasion by thousands of UBS' clients who were U.S. citizens. Arrested in October 2013 during a trip to Italy, Weil has been extradited to the United States. Charged with tax fraud before the federal district court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on 16 December 2013, Weil was released on $10.5 million bail. 
Banking Career.
Raoul Weil was hired by the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), and worked in SBC's private banking division in Basel, Zurich, Monaco, and New York City from 1984 until 1998. He joined UBS as part of its private banking division for Asia and Europe before becoming head of UBS's Wealth Management International unit in 2002. 
Weil was relieved of his duties pending the resolution of the ongoing investigation of UBS's US cross-border business by the United States Department of Justice which resulted in his indictment on 12 November 2008. The United States issued an international arrest warrant for Weil in 2008.
2008-09 U.S. tax evasion controversy.
In 2008, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation began probing a multi-million-dollar tax evasion case involving UBS due to disclosures made by Brad Birkenfeld, a former UBS banker in Switzerland, who testified to the US Department of Justice, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and the US Internal Revenue Service. Concurrently, a United States Senate subcommittee accused Swiss banks, including UBS, of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through offshore accounts, which it estimated cost of the U.S. excess of US$100 billion annually.
In response, UBS announced that it would cease providing cross-border private banking services to US-domiciled clients through its non-US regulated units as of July 2008. In November 2008, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Raoul Weil in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS's US cross-border business. UBS would eventually cut ties to Weil in May 2009 and he would continue to face charges after UBS had settled its criminal case with the U.S. government.
UBS agreed on February 18, 2009 to pay a fine of US$780 million to the U.S. government and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement on charges of conspiring to defraud the United States by impeding the Internal Revenue Service.
On 6 January 2014, according to the National Whistleblowers Center, "Raoul Weil may make a "deal with the US Department of Justice because he has "information that would be extremely embarrassing to wealthy and powerful people" in the United States and elsewhere."
Reuss Private Group.
After leaving UBS, Weil was hired as a consultant in 2010 by Reuss Private Group (Pfäffikon, Schwyz, Switzerland), eventually becoming a managing partner. At the beginning of 2013, he succeeded Adriano B. Lucatelli as appointed chief executive officer of Reuss.
Other activities.
Raoul Weil is a member of the Optimus Foundation, a charitable foundation administered by UBS which helps with disease prevention and education across the world.
Legal issues.
On January 13, 2009, in an article about the Bernard Madoff scandal, the Associated Press reported "In an separate case also affecting wealthy investors, former UBS AG wealth management head Raoul Weil was formally declared a fugitive on Tuesday after failing to surrender to U.S. authorities on charges of conspiring to help wealthy Americans hide assets to avoid paying taxes." Weil's attorney Aaron Marcu says his client is not guilty of the charges. Another private banker for UBS, Brad Birkenfeld, was indicted on similar charges in May 2008 and later pleaded guilty.
Extradition to U.S..
On October 19, 2013, Weil was arrested at Bologna, Italy while on a trip from Switzerland. After his request for house arrest was turned down by Italian authorities, Weil decided to give up his fight against extradition to the United States. Weil's willingness to return to the U.S. raised the suspicion that he may have been offered a "sweet heart deal" by the U.S. Department of Justice, which treated another UBS conspirator, Martin Liechti, extremely leniently, according to Bradley Birkenfeld's lawyer, Stephen M. Kohn of the National Whistleblower Center. 
Birkenfeld worked directly under Weil at UBS and "knows where all the skeletons are buried," according to Kohn. Kohn claims that, "Weil can clearly bargain inside information he has that could be embarrassing to American officials or institutions for leniency."
Charged with tax fraud in his appearance before the federal district court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on 16 December 2013, Weil was released on $10.5 million bail by U.S. Magistrate Judge Patrick Hunt. Weil was allowed to stay with friends in New Jersey until his scheduled arraignment on 7 January 2014. At his 7 January 2014 arraignment, Weil pleaded not-guilty to helping U.S. taxpayers evade taxes on $20 billion in offshore assets.

Rock Crystal (Fabergé egg)

The Rock Crystal Egg or Revolving Miniatures Egg is an Imperial Fabergé egg, one in a series of fifty-two jeweled eggs made under the supervision of Peter Carl Fabergé for the Russian Imperial family. It was created in 1896 for Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna. The egg currently resides in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.
Design.
The egg was created by Faberge's workmaster, Mikhail Evlampievich Perkhin (Russian, 1860–1903) with miniatures by Johannes Zehngraf (Danish, 1857–1908) It stands about 248 mm (9 3/4 in) tall on its stand, with a diameter of 98 mm (3 7/8 in.) The outer shell is rock crystal banded with emerald-green enameled gold studded with diamonds. On the apex of the egg is a Siberian emerald supported by an emerald-green enameled gold mount. This cabochon-style emerald is one of the largest gemstones Fabergé used in any of the Imperial eggs. The egg's base sits on a plinth of rock crystal. The base consists of a colorfully enameled gold double spheroid which is circled twice with rose-cut diamonds. It has the monograms of the Tsarina, as the Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt before her marriage, and later as Alexandra Fedorovna, Empress of Russia. Each monogram is surmounted with a diamond crown of the respective royal house. These monograms form a continuous pattern around the base of the egg.
Surprise.
Inside the rock crystal egg is a gold support holding twelve miniature paintings. The paintings are of the various palaces and residences that were significant to the Empress. Each location holds a special memory for Nicholas and Alexandra in the early days of their courtship, as they had just been married two years prior, in 1894.
When the large cabochon emerald on the apex is depressed it engages a mechanism that rotates the miniatures inside the egg. A hook moves down and folds the framed pictures back, like the pages of a book, so two paintings can be fully seen at one time. Each miniature is framed in gold with an emerald on the apex. The frames are attached to a central fluted gold shaft which passes vertically through the egg.
The locations include:
History.
The egg was presented by Nicholas II to Alexandra Fedorovna on March 24, 1896. She received it at Eastertide in the same year that the young couple had suddenly ascended the throne.
In 1909 the egg was housed in the Empress' study in the Winter Palace. The egg was seized by the Kerensky Provisional Government and moved to the Armory Palace of the Kremlin in Moscow along with approximately 40 other eggs. In 1930, the "Rock Crystal Egg" was one of the ten Eggs sold by the Antikvariat (Trade Department) to the Hammer Galleries in New York for 8000 rubles, or approximately $4000 U.S. In 1945 the egg became the last of five Imperial Easter Eggs bought by Lillian Thomas Pratt, the wife of a General Motors executive John Lee Pratt. Upon Lillian Thomas Pratt's death in 1947, the egg was willed to Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, Virginia. It remains on view as part of the Virginia Museum of Fine Art's European Decorative Art collection.

On April 27, 2009, Luke launched a proprietary signature cosmetics line called By Lauren Luke. Sephora launched the line in 135 stores across the USA and Canada on September 21, 2009. October 1, 2009, Hodder & Stoughton released Luke’s book, “Looks By Lauren Luke,” in the UK. In November 2009, Luke is to be featured as an avatar in the Nintendo DS game "Supermodel Makeover By Lauren Luke".
Advocacy.
In July 2012, Luke teamed with Refuge, an UK-based advocacy group, to produce a video as part of their 'Don't Cover It Up' campaign to encourage women who have been victims of domestic violence to report incidents. The video depicts Luke starting out in the usual tutorial manner, however she is depicted using foundation to cover up bruises from an implied beating. While Luke was already well known in the UK, the video was promoted by the National Organization for Women in the United States, and reported on internationally. Luke noted that, "The bruising on my face for the video wasn't real, but my emotions in that video were. I had a bad experience in the past with a previous boyfriend. He never physically hurt me but I did sometimes fear what would happen next if I said the wrong thing. He could be overprotective and embarrass me in front of my work colleagues or friends because of his aggressive behavior. Sometimes it was like living with a volcano which could erupt at any second—I felt I was walking on egg shells just to keep him from exploding and smashing something across the room."

Blood Mud

Blood Mud is a crime novel by the American writer K.C. Constantine set in 1990s Rocksburg, a fictional, blue-collar, Rustbelt town in Western Pennsylvania (modeled on the author's hometown of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Pittsburgh).
Mario Balzic is the protagonist, an atypical detective for the genre, a Serbo-Italian American cop, unpretentious, a family man who asks questions and uses more sense than force. 
The novel opens with Balzic again being lured out of his retirement with an offer: track down the missing guns from a local gun shop for an insurance company.
It is the fifteenth book in the 17-volume Rocksburg series.

Lancaster University Table Tennis Club

Lancaster University Table Tennis Club, or LUTTC as it is better known is a club affiliated to the Athletic Union of Lancaster University.
History.
The Logo.
The recently upgraded LUTTC logo was designed by 2008/09 President, Robin Honey. The shift came about at the time of the overhaul of the website in order to both modernise it and bring it into line with the style and accessibility of other Athletic Union websites.
The current logo has obvious table tennis insignia - it's ball shaped, small and white, like the majority of table tennis balls used in matchplay worldwide. The more astute among viewers will also notice that the 'L.U.T.T.C' acronym and the 3 "*s" are, stylistically, in line with the production of table tennis balls. The 3 "*s" are akin to the 3 stars that are found on a table tennis ball, used to indicate its quality. Only balls of 3 star quality are permitted for match play. The small red logo and 'L.U.T.T.C' are placed as the brand logo and brand name would be placed on a table tennis ball. The small red logo is the Lancaster University logo and L.U.T.T.C stands for 'Lancaster University Table Tennis Club'.

In only their 2nd season back, under President Robin Honey,the Men's 1st team was able to finish 1st in the Northern 2A league with an unbeaten record, gaining automatic promotion into the Northern 1A league for the next season. This was a big step forward for the club as it gives them a change to compete with the some of the top Northern teams in the 2009/10 season.

Federal Interpleader Act of 1917

The Federal Interpleader Act of 1917 was United States federal legislation enacted by the 64th United States Congress approved February 22, 1917. In 1925 it was codified in the United States Code as 28 U.S.C. 41(26) (1925).
History.
The Act allowed an insurance company, or fraternal benefit society subject to multiple claims on the same policy to file a suit in equity by a bill of interpleader in United States District Courts and providing nationwide service of process. It was introduced to overcome the ruling of the United States Supreme Court in New York Life v. Dunlevy , that for a party to be bound by an interpleader that party must be served process in a way that obtains personal jurisdiction. The policy must have a value of at least $500 is claimed or may be claimed by adverse claimants; which is less than the amount in controversy of $3,000 in Judicial Code §48(1) then required for general diversity jurisdiction. Two or more of the beneficiaries must live in different states.
This Act was amended in 1925 by approved February 25, 1925 dividing it into three sections, eliminating the words "may claim" that were in the 1917 act and clarifying the venue provisions . This element of civil procedure was subsequently in 1926 was repealed and replaced by, approved May 8,1926, which added to those who can bring suit casualty company and surety company, empowered the court to enjoin claimant from proceeding in any state or other federal court on the same liability, adding provisions as to the proper venue for the interpleader in cases were the claimants are in different districts. In 1936 the Federal Interpeader Act was again repealed and replaced by the Federal Interpleader Act of 1936 , , approved Jan. 20, 1936, drafted by Zechariah Chafee which codified it in as United States Judicial Code §41(26), and established the modern statutory interpleader allowing suite to be brought by any person, firm, corporation, association or society having custody of money or property or insurance policy or instrument valued at $500 or more which there are two or more adverse claimant who are citizens of different states, whether or not the claims have common origins, identical, adverse or independent of each other, and allowed it to be an equitable defense in actions at law, Judicial Code §274b. When the United States Judicial Code was enacted into United States Code as positive law in 1948, approved June 25, 1948, it was reconstituted as , , and .
The Act.
United States District Courts have jurisdiction to hear suites in equity began by a bill of interpleader where:
The court may issue process to any claimant to the United States marshal of any district the claimant may reside or be found.

Jardwadjali

The Jardwadjali (also known as "Jadawadjali") people are Indigenous Australians who occupy the lands in the upper Wimmera River watershed east to Gariwerd (Grampians) and west to Lake Bringalbert. The towns of Horsham, Cavendish, Coleraine, Apsley, Minyip and Donald are within their territory. There were 37 Jardwadjali clans who formed an alliance with the neighboring Djab wurrung people through intermarriage, shared culture, trade and moiety system. The Jardwadjali society is matrilineal.
Language.
The Jardwadjali language shares 90 percent common vocabulary with Djab wurrung. Sub-dialects include Jagwadjali, Mardidjali, and Nundadjali.
History.
The Jardwadjali people have lived in the area for up to 30,000 to 40,000 years, certainly with evidence of occupation in Gariwerd many thousands of years before the last ice-age. One site in the Victoria Range (Billawin
Range) has been dated from 22,000 years ago.
It is likely that first contact with Europeans was through smallpox epidemics which arrived with the First Fleet in 1788 and rapidly spread through the trading networks of indigenous Australians and killed many people in two waves before the 1830s. One Wotjobaluk account called the disease "thinba micka" and that it killed large numbers of people, and disfigured many more with pock-marked faces, and came down the Murray River sent by malevolent sorcerers to the north.
Conflict and dispossession.
In 1836 the squatter Edward Henty was exploring Jardwadjali land from the south, the start of the European invasion. A further wave of European occupation occurred from the north in 1840 with Lieutenant Robert Briggs squatting near Lake Lonsdale.
The explorer Major Thomas Mitchell passed through the lands of the Jardwadjali people in 1836 and named many geographical features, including the Grampian mountains which he named after the range of mountains in Scotland. The Jardwadjali called these mountains "Gariwerd" with Gar meaning ‘pointed mountain’, i meaning ‘the’ and werd meaning ‘shoulder’.
To the Jardwadjali and Djab wurrung peoples Gariwerd was central to the dreaming of the creator, Bunjil, and "buledji Brambimbula", the two brothers Bram, who were responsible for the creation and naming of many landscape features in western Victoria.
Jardwadjali people formed the nucleus of the Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868, although efforts were made by the Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines to stop the tour. The team played 47 matches, winning 14, losing 14, and drawing 19 games. 
There were no aboriginal missions established in "Jardwadjali" territory, so by the 1860s and 1870s many Jardwadjali were forced to locate at Ebenezer Mission in Wergaia country on the Wimmera River, and at Lake Condah mission in Dhauwurd wurrung country.
Massacres.
Settlement was marked by resistance to the invasion often by driving off or stealing sheep which then resulted in conflict and sometimes a massacre of aboriginal people.
Very few of these reports were acted upon to bring the settlers to court. After the massacre at Fighting Hills, John Whyte travelled to Melbourne to inform Governor La Trobe in person of the massacre. The depositions of the Aboriginal Protector Charles Sievwright who had personally investigated the massacre were disallowed. No trial was ever held. At the time aborigines were denied the right to give evidence in courts of law. The incidents listed below are just the cases that have been reported; it is likely other incidents occurred that were never reported and not documented officially. Neil Black, a squatter in Western Victoria writing on 9 December 1839 states the prevailing attitude of many settlers:
George Robinson, the Chief Protector of Aborigines wrote in his journal in 1841 referring to the Portland Bay area where the Whyte Brothers had settled:
Table: reported massacres in Jardwadjali country to 1859 
Recent history.
In 1989 there was a proposal by Victorian Minister for Tourism, Steve Crabb to rename many geographical place names associated with aboriginal heritage in the area. There was much opposition to this proposal by European descendants. The Brambuk centre, representing five aboriginal communities, advocated a dual name for the main area: Gariwerd/Grampians.
Some of the changes included:
The "Brambuk National Park and Cultural Centre" in Halls Gap is owned and managed by Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung people from five Aboriginal communities with historic links to the Gariwerd-Grampians ranges and the surrounding plains.
Native Title recognition.
The indigenous peoples of the Wimmera won native title recognition on 13 December 2005 after a ten year legal process. It was the first successful native title claim in south-eastern Australia and in Victoria, determined by Justice Ron Merkel involving Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jardwadjali, Wergaia and Jupagalk people. In his reasons for judgement Justice Merkel explained the significance of his orders:

Stock-Raising Homestead Act

Overview.
The Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 provided settlers of public land—a full section or its equivalent—for ranching purposes. Unlike the Homestead Act of 1862 or the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909, land homesteaded under the 1916 act separated surface rights from subsurface rights, resulting in what later became known as split estates. The subsurface rights, also known as mineral rights, are the foundation of recent oil and gas law in the United States.
Under the act no cultivation of lands was required, but some range improvements were mandated as necessary.
By 2006, the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and subsequent legislation and other legal changes resulted in the federal government administering the subsurface rights to about of land, of which have surface rights owned privately or by a U.S. state.
Text of the Stock-Raising Act.
CHAP. 9. --An Act To provide for stock-raising homesteads, and for other purposes.
"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled," That from and after the passage of this Act it shall be lawful for any person qualified to make entry under the homestead laws of the United States to make a stock-raising homestead entry for not exceeding six hundred and forty acres of unappropriated unreserved public land in reasonably compact form: "Provided, however," That the land so entered shall theretofore have been designated by the Secretary of the Interior as "stock-raising lands."
SEC. 2. That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized, on application or otherwise, to designate as stock-raising lands subject to entry under this Act lands the surface of which is, in his opinion, chiefly valuable for grazing and raising forage crops, do not contain merchantable timber, are not susceptible of irrigation from any known source of water supply, and are of such character that six hundred and forty acres are reasonably required for the support of a family: "Provided," That where any person qualified to make original or additional entry under the provisions of this Act shall make application to enter any unappropriated public land which has not been designated as subject to entry (provided said application is accompanied and supported by properly corroborated affidavit of the applicant, in duplicate, showing prima facie that the land applied for is of the character contemplated by this Act), such application, together with the regular fees and commissions shall be received by the register and receiver of the land district in which said land is located and suspended until it shall have been determined by the Secretary of the Interior whether said land is actually of that character. That during such suspension the land described in the application shall not be disposed of; and if the said land shall be designated under this Act, then such application shall be allowed; otherwise it shall be rejected, subject to appeal; but no right to occupy such lands shall be acquired by reason of said application until said lands have been designated as stock-raising lands.
SEC. 3. That any qualified homestead entryman may make entry under the homestead laws of lands so designated by the Secretary of the Interior, according to legal subdivisions, in areas not exceeding six hundred and forty acres, and in compact form so far as may be subject to the provisions of this Act, and secure title thereto by compliance with the terms of the homestead laws: "Provided," That a former homestead entry of land of the character described in section two hereof shall not be a bar to the entry of a tract within a radius of twenty miles from such former entry under the provisions of this Act, subject to the requirements of law as to residence and improvements, which, together with the former entry, shall not exceed six hundred and forty acres: "Provided further," That the entryman shall be required to enter all contiguous areas of the character herein described open to entry prior to the entry of any noncontiguous land: "Provided further," That instead of cultivation as required by the homestead laws the entryman shall be required to make permanent improvements upon the land entered before final proof is submitted tending to increase the value of the same for stock-raising purposes, of the value of not less than $1.25 per acre, and at least one-half of such improvements shall be placed upon the land within three years after the date of entry thereof.
SEC. 4. That any homestead entryman of lands of the character herein described, who has not submitted final proof upon his existing entry, shall have the right to enter, subject to the provisions of this Act, such amount of contiguous lands designated for entry under the provisions of this Act as shall not, together with the amount embraced in his original entry, exceed six hundred and forty acres, and residence upon the original entry shall be credited on both entries, but improvements must be made on the additional entry equal to $1.25 for each acre thereof.
SEC. 5. That persons who have submitted final proof upon, or received patent for, lands of the character herein described under the homestead laws, and who own and reside upon the land so acquired, may, subject to the provisions of this Act, make additional entry for and obtain patent to contiguous lands designated for entry under the provisions of this Act, which, together with the area theretofore acquired under the homestead law, shall not exceed six hundred and forty acres, on proof of the expenditure required by this Act on account of permanent improvements upon the additional entry.
SEC. 6. That any person who is the head of a family, or who has arrived at the age of twenty-one years and is a citizen of the United States, who has entered or acquired under the homestead laws, prior to the passage of this Act, lands of the character described in this Act, the area of which is less than six hundred and forty acres, and who is unable to exercise the right of additional entry herein conferred because no lands subject to entry under this Act, adjoin the tract so entered or acquired or lie within the twenty mile limit provided for in this Act, may, upon submitting proof that he resides upon and has not sold the land so entered or acquired and against which land there are no encumbrances, relinquish or reconvey to the United States the land so occupied, entered, or acquired, and in lieu thereof, within the same land-office district, may enter and acquire title to six hundred and forty acres of the land subject to entry under this Act, but must show compliance with all the provisions of existing homestead laws except as modified herein.
SEC. 7. That the commutation provisions of the homestead laws shall not apply to any entires made under this Act.
SEC. 8. That any homestead entrymen or patentees who shall be entitled to additional entry under this Act shall have, for ninety days after the designation of lands subject to entry under the provisions of this Act and contiguous to those entered or owned and occupied by him, the preferential right to make additional entry as provided in this Act: "Provided," That where such lands contiguous to the lands of two or more entrymen or patentees entitled to additional entries under this section are not sufficient in area to enable such entrymen to secure by additional entry the maximum amounts to which they are entitled, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to make an equitable division of the lands among the several entrymen or patentees, applying to exercise preferential rights, such division to be in tracts of not less than forty acres, or other legal subdivision, and so made as to equalize as nearly as possible the area which such entrymen and patentees will acquire by adding the tracts embraced in additional entries to the lands originally held or owned by them: "Provided further," That where but one such tract of vacant land may adjoin the lands of two or more entrymen or patentees entitled to exercise preferential right hereunder, the tract in question may be entered by the person who first submits to the local land office his application to exercise said preferential right.
SEC. 9. That all entries made and patents issued under the provisions of this Act shall be subject to and contain a reservation to the United States of all the coal and other minerals in the lands so entered and patented, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same.

Benjamin Duff

Benjamin Robert Duff (16 October 1867 – 25 June 1943) was a South African rugby union international. He also played a first-class cricket match with Western Province. Duff, born in Swellendam, had a brother Colin who represented Rhodesia at cricket and rugby.
Duff's cricket match was against Natal during the 1889/90 South African cricket season. Although he batted with the tail, at number 10 in both innings, Duff wasn't called on to bowl once in the match. He scored one and eight not out, dismissed by Test player Gus Kempis in the first dig. Western Province's wicket-keeper for this game, Alfred Richards, was also a rugby union international and the duo appeared together in a Test with the South African national rugby union team.
In 1891, Duff played three rugby union Test matches in a home series against the British Isles. These were the first ever official Tests that South Africa played and due to the order in which players' names were listed on team sheets for a match at the time, Duff has the distinction of being the first Springbok. He played his games as a full-back and represented Western Province at provincial rugby.

Henry Bishop (postmaster general)

Henry Bishopp, (1611–1691/2), also spelt Bishop and Bisshopp, from Henfield in Sussex, England was a Postmaster General of England and inventor of the first postmark used on mail. He was the second son of Sir Thomas Bishopp, 1st Baronet of Parham in Sussex. Henry at first fought for King Charles I, but was reconciled with parliament in 1647, after spending two years in Virginia. In the meantime his Rectory estate in Henfield had been sequestered. However he was restored to royal favour in 1660 and served as postmaster-general between that date and 1663. At his death in 1692 his Rectory estate in Henfield passed to his great nephew Sir Cecil Bishopp, 4th Baronet. 
Postmaster General.
Before the creation of the position of Postmaster General control of the post was in the hands of "Master of the King's Post". In 1660, at The Restoration, Henry Bishop paid £21,500 per year to farm the Post Office for a term of seven years. This was more than double the previous payment. Bishop's letters patent gave him the monopoly to carry letters within the kingdom. His appointment was to start on 25 June 1660, but was delayed until 29 September when the Act of Parliament reconstituted the General Post Office. Bishop claimed no less than £500 in compensation for the loss of income because several independent posts had been started between London and the country but were not suppressed until the act was passed; they infringed on his monopoly to carry letters.
Bishop was the first officially appointed Postmaster General to Charles II but within a year of taking office he was accused of abuses. In reply, he mentions the improvements he instigated including the stamping of letters, on 2 August 1661. He served in the position until April 1663 at which time he gave up the remainder of his lease to Daniel O'Neill.
Bishop mark.
Henry Bishop introduced the world's first known postmark that takes his name in 1661. The "Bishop Mark" was designed to show the date on which a letter was received by the post and to ensure that the dispatch of letters would not be delayed. These were the world's first handstruck postage stamps
Bishop announced, 
The postmarks were usually on the back of the letter and are known initially used in the Chief Office in London but were introduced later in Dublin, Edinburgh and New York.
The original London Bishop Mark, first used 19 April 1661 consisted of a small circle of 13 mm diameter, bisected horizontally, with the month (in serifed lettering) abbreviated to two letters, in the upper half and the day of the month in the lower half. Similar marks were used later in Scotland and Ireland, as well as the North American colonies.
In 1673, a new mark was brought into use which had a diameter of between 13 and 14 mm. The type used from this point was sans-serif and this continued in use until 1713. In 1713, larger handstamps were introduced which ranged in size from 14 to 20 mm. The layout of these was also changed, with the month appearing at the base. This type remained in use until 1787, when it was replaced by the double circle type.

He stood 5'11" (180 cm) tall and weighed 170 pounds (77 kg). During his two-season Major League career, Lund batted .261, with 12 hits, no home runs, and 1 run batted in. 
Lund was an adept defensive player who spent almost his entire 11-year playing career in minor league baseball (1960–1970). He signed with the Cleveland Indians and in his 1960 rookie season led Florida State League shortstops in putouts. The following year, he led Carolina League shortstops in double plays and fielding percentage. But Lund did not reach Cleveland until August 1, 1967, and received only a three-game trial with the Indians before being traded during the offseason to the Baltimore Orioles. After another minor league season, the O's shipped Lund to the Seattle Pilots on the eve of the 1969 campaign, and he got into 20 games with Seattle that season, 17 at shortstop. Despite his fielding prowess as a minor leaguer, in the Majors he made six errors in 61 total chances at shortstop, for a poor .902 fielding average.
From 1974-1982, Lund managed in the Chicago White Sox farm system, from Class A to the AAA levels. He compiled a won-loss mark of 608-615 (.497). His 1978 Appleton Foxes won the Midwest League championship.

<doc id="20309035" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20309035" title="Super QCD">
Super QCD

In theoretical physics, super QCD is a supersymmetric gauge theory which resembles quantum chromodynamics (QCD) but contains additional particles and interactions which render it supersymmetric.
The most commonly used version of super QCD is in 4 dimensions and contains one Majorana spinor supercharge. The particle content consists of vector supermultiplets, which include gluons and gluinos and also chiral supermultiplets which contain quarks and squarks transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. This theory has many features in common with real world QCD, for example in some phases it manifests confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. The supersymmetry of this theory means that, unlike QCD, one may use nonrenormalization theorems to analytically demonstrate the existence of these phenomena and even calculate the condensate which breaks the chiral symmetry.
Phases of super QCD.
Consider 4-dimensional SQCD with gauge group SU(N) and M flavors of chiral multiplets. The vacuum structure depends on M and N. The squarks may be reorganized into mesons and baryons, and the moduli space of vacua of the theory may be parametrized by their vacuum expectation values. On most of the moduli space the Higgs mechanism makes all of the fields massive, and so they may be integrated out. Classically, the resulting moduli space is singular. The singularities correspond to points where some gluons are massless, and so could not be integrated out. In the full quantum moduli space is nonsingular, and its structure depends on the relative values of M and N. For example, when M is less than or equal to N+1, the theory exhibits confinement.
When M is less than N, the effective action differs from the classical action. More precisely, while the perturbative nonrenormalization theory forbids any perturbative correction to the superpotential, the superpotential receives nonperturbative corrections. When N=M+1, these corrections result from a single instanton. For larger values of N the instanton calculation suffers from infrared divergences, however the correction may nonetheless be determined precisely from the gaugino condensation. The quantum correction to the superpotential was calculated in The Massless Limit Of Supersymmetric Qcd. If the chiral multiplets are massless, the resulting potential energy has no minimum and so the full quantum theory has no vacuum. Instead the fields roll forever to larger values.
When M is equal to or greater than N, the classical superpotential is exact. When M is equal to N, however, the moduli space receives quantum corrections from a single instanton. This correction renders the moduli space nonsingular, and also leads to chiral symmetry breaking. Then M is equal to N+1 the moduli space is not modified and so there is no chiral symmetry breaking, however there is still confinement.
When M is greater than N+1 but less than 3N/2, the theory is asymptotically free. However at low energies the theory becomes strongly coupled, and is better described by a Seiberg dual description in terms of magnetic variables with the same global flavor symmetry group but a new gauge symmetry SU(M-N). Notice that the gauge group is not an observable, but simply reflects the redundancy or a description and so may well differ in various dual theories, as it does in this case. On the other hand the global symmetry group is an observable so it is essential that it is the same, SU(M), in both descriptions. The dual magnetic theory is free in the infrared, the coupling constant shrinks logarithmically, and so by the Dirac quantization condition the electric coupling constant grows logarithmically in the infrared. This implies that the potential between two electric charges, at long distances, scales as the logarithm of their distance divided by the distance.
When M is between 3N/2 and 3N, in the theory has an infrared fixed point where it becomes a nontrivial conformal field theory. The potential between electric charges obeys the usual Colomb law, it is inversely proportional to the distance between the charges.
When M is greater than 3N, the theory is free in the infrared, and so the force between two charges is inversely proportional to the product of the distance times the logarithm of the distance between the charges. However the theory is ill-defined in the ultraviolet, unless one includes additional heavy degrees of freedom which lead, for example, to a Seiberg dual theory of the type described above at N+1<M<3N/2.

Vincenzo, Martyr of Craco

San Vincenzo Martire is a minor saint of the Roman Catholic Church. He is remembered in devotions by the people of Craco, Italy and immigrants and their descendants from that town who settled in North America. San Vincenzo's feast day is celebrated on the fourth Sunday of October in Craco, Italy and Manhattan, New York.
The Origin of San Vincenzo Martire.
San Vincenzo is said to have been one of the Theban Legion, a legion of soldiers who converted "en masse" to Christianity and who were martyred for refusal to participate in sacrifices to the Roman emperor prior to battle in the year 286 AD.
Origin of the Devotion to San Vincenzo.
The village of Craco in the Province of Matera is the site of the former Friary of the Franciscans. The building of the Friary began on April 3, 1620 by a Friar named Robert, the then Bishop of Tricarico, and was finally completed ten years later in 1630. The Friary bore the name of St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, and was entrusted to the care of the Franciscan Friars who retained it until the Italian Government suppressed it in 1866. 
Next to this Friary was a beautiful church to the left of which, in 1777, a rather large chapel was built. This chapel was dedicated to San Vincenzo Martire in the year 1793. 
On February 6, 1769, a small bone relic of San Vincenzo was sent to Craco from Rome. Then in 1792, Fr. Prospero, a Franciscan from Craco, finding himself in Rome, and wishing to return home with a relic of some glorious martyr, obtained from Pope Pius VI, through the Sacred Congregation of Rites, a relic which was said to be that of a Roman soldier as well as a glorious martyr, by the name of Vincenzo – a name signifying “winner” or “conqueror.” The “sacred body with a flask of blood” of San Vincenzo Martire was exhumed at the cemetery of St. Ciriaca, in Rome. Fr. Prospero enclosed the precious relic in an artistic crystal-sided casket. Inside the casket was set the waxen body of the martyr, dressed as a Roman soldier and lying in a reclining position.
Stopping at various places during the course of its journey from Rome, the remains were carried all the way to Craco where it was received with great pomp and honor by the local clergy and townspeople. The great devotion of the faithful in the region and neighboring towns rendered great honor to the soldier martyr San Vincenzo. In large measure, this was due to the many miracles reportedly performed by the Saint for the suffering multitudes that sought his help.
The holy relic of San Vincenzo arrived in Craco on June 4, 1792. The clergy and the people of Craco decided to choose San Vincenzo, along with San Nicola of Bari, as their patron and protector of the town. The religious and civil festival of San Vincenzo was fixed for the fourth Sunday of October to coincide with the important annual fair which takes place after the harvest. On April 4, 1793 the relic of San Vincenzo was installed in the chapel at the Friary and remained there until the late 1980s when structural instability required the relic to be relocated to a small chapel in the Sant’Angelo section of Craco where it resides today. Although the Friary dedicated to St. Peter served as his home, the overwhelming majority of the population of Craco still calls it "the Convent of San Vincenzo."
The Feast of San Vincenzo.
Traditionally, the feast in Craco celebrating San Vincenzo began nine days before the fourth Sunday in October with the recitation of solemn afternoon novenas. On one of those evenings, a small procession took place, with a statue representing the upright figure of the relic, starting from the Chapel and moving around the "Cross", then located at the entrance to the town. On Friday evening, after the novena, the statue of the saint was brought into the Chiesa Madre of San Nicola located in the heart of the old town. On Saturday evening, before the feast day, the statue was carried in procession back to the chapel that served as its home. All celebrations culminated on Sunday with the Mass at the Friary and the procession that crossed the entire town. That evening, in front of the Palazzo Rigirone, there were bright fireworks displays.
The Fair.
The feast in honor of San Vincenzo was always preceded on the Saturday before by a fair, a proud tradition carried out since the end of the 18th century until today. The fair, traditionally known by all the nearby people and neighboring towns, brought many people from Salandra, Fernandina, Montalbano and Pisticci. The fair branched from the entrance of Craco to the other end of the town, at the drinking trough. It was held at the time of the year when workers of the earth were engaged in preparing land for planting or harvesting olives. But on that day, all work ceased so the people could make major purchases at the fair. Animals of all types, as well as foodstuffs: dried beans, “winter” apples, and dried peppers that would be used to season salami were available. This served as a way for people to purchase provisions for the long winter that awaited the rural population.
Confraternity of San Vincenzo Martire'.
Until the early decades of the 20th century a confraternity of devout worshippers of San Vincenzo existed in Craco. Those belonging to the confraternity were characterized by wearing a white tunic with a turquoise cape and belt. This group took part in the Mass, processions, and upon request also at funerals.
San Vincenzo Martire in New York.
With immigration to America at the turn of the 20th century, the Crachesi brought the devotion to their patron saint with them. In 1899 they formed a mutual aid society, the Società San Vincenzo Martire di Craco. 
In 1901 this group associated itself with St. Joachim's Church, formerly located at 28 Roosevelt St., providing the church with a statue that is a copy of the reclining relic of San Vincenzo in Craco, the 1769 bone relic from Craco, and a handwritten copy of the original novena as said in Craco. The first celebration of the feast of San Vincenzo Martire in New York City's Little Italy was held on Saturday and Sunday October 24 - 25, 1901. The Societa San Vincenzo Martire di Craco continued to maintain the traditional celebration of the feast on the fourth Sunday of October until 1941. With the onset of WWII, the celebration of the feast was suspended although the religious celebration of a special Mass continued. In 1952, the Società San Vincenzo Martire di Craco was dissolved. 
Individual devotees, all descendants of the Crachesi immigrants, continued sponsoring the religious celebration of a special Mass for San Vincenzo Martire at St. Joachim's Church. In 1957, an urban renewal project, ordered by the City of New York, dictated the closing of the church in 1958, and required the relocation of the statues before the church was demolished. 
The statue, which is a copy of the reclining relic of San Vincenzo in Craco, and the bone relic from 1769 were relocated to the Church of St. Joseph, 5 Monroe Street, Manhattan where arrangements were made for the religious celebration of a special Mass annually. The upright processional statue was placed at St. Rosalia – Regina Pacis Parish in Brooklyn, but was lost to the effects of time. 
St. Joseph's Church still maintains the feast day by celebrating a special Mass on the fourth Sunday in October.

Multi-jackbolt tensioner

Multi-jackbolt tensioners (MJT) provide an alternative to traditional bolted joints Rather than needing to tighten one large bolt, MJTs use several smaller jackbolts to drastically reduce the torque required to attain a certain preload. MJTs range in thread sizes from 3/4” to 32” and can achieve up to 20 million pounds of force and greater. MJTs only require hand-held tools, such as torque wrenches or air/electric impacts, for loading and unloading bolted joints.
Basics of multi-jackbolt tensioners.
Multi-jackbolt tensioners (MJTs), registered under the trademark Superbolt or Supernut, are designed to decrease the torque required to tighten large bolted joints. One of the major problems associated with traditional bolt tightening methods is as the diameter of the bolt increases, the amount of torque required to tighten it increases in the third power of the diameter. Because of this, the largest size bolt a person can typically tighten by hand is 1".
Multi-jackbolt tensioners reduce the amount of torque required to clamp the joint by using multiple jackbolts threaded through the nut or bolt head.
The jackbolts, which are small enough to be tightened by simple hand tools, thrust against a hardened washer and generate clamping force on the joint. Loads up to 20,000,000 pounds and greater are attainable using only hand tools. MJTs and related products are produced by Superbolt, Inc. in Carnegie, PA.
Mechanical advantage.
MJTs have a high mechanical advantage for tightening large nuts. To calculate mechanical advantage over standard hex nuts, the following formula is used:
formula_1
Where:
Safety.
MJTs are a relatively safe bolting method because only small hand or air tools are required for tightening. Other methods, including thermal tightening, crane wrenching, hydraulic wrenches and sledgehammers, can cause serious worker injuries due to heat, electricity, highly pressurized hydraulic fluid and brute force. Back and other injuries can also be avoided because no heavy tightening equipment needs to be lifted onto the bolt. Safety is also increased because MJTs prevent parts from becoming loose.
Downtime.
Due to dynamic loads, bolted joints have a tendency to loosen. Downtime is significantly reduced because MJTs are able to easily achieve the large clamping forces required to prevent bolted components from vibrating loose. Therefore, less time is spent tightening joints repeatedly and fixing problems caused by loose joints. MJTs also reduce the likelihood the bolted joint will fail, which reduces downtime caused by needing to replace damaged components.
Installation time.
Even though more individual jackbolts must be tightened, installation is still fast in comparison to other methods. Because the torque required to tighten each small jackbolt is exponentially less than the torque required to tighten one large nut, it takes less time and effort overall to tighten the larger number of jackbolts. Also, no additional time is spent moving around heavy equipment to tighten each nut. Installation processes have been developed using air tools, which also greatly reduces installation time. Additionally, multiple workers can work on a joint simultaneously since the tooling required is inexpensive. Another common method, thermal tightening, can take a long time because the stud must be heated, and clamping force is not obtained and cannot be checked until it is cooled since it depends on shrinkage. If the stud is not at proper stretch, the heating process must be repeated.
Disadvantages.
MJTs may not be cost effective for bolts smaller than 1" diameter, low-stress applications, and in plants where the number of studs/bolts to retrofit is difficult to justify versus prior investment in existing tightening equipment.
Common applications.
Presses.
Multi-jackbolt tensioners can be used on many press column applications, especially where large thread sizes are required. Thrust collars ease assembly and disassembly on large press columns, while greatly reducing critical problems such as thread galling and seizing. Multi-jackbolt tensioners are also used on tie-rods, bearing blocks, high-pressure piping, die cushions, cylinder ram bolting, and anchor bolts.
Mining.
Mining applications often require high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, which can cause joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, ring gears, side frames, hoist motors, drag lines, pinion gears, split gears, and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as toothed rims, require short bolts – MJTs can be useful in these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint.
Hydro Power.
Multi-jackbolt tensioners are used in several hydro applications, including turbine couplings, blade bolts, turbine wheel to shaft bolting, pelton turbine nozzles, servo piston nuts, bearing housings, and ball valves. Multi-jackbolt expansion bolts provide additional benefit for shaft couplings, because they generate both radial and axial forces, creating the interference fit necessary. MJTs can also easily achieve the high preloads required on Kaplan turbine crossheads and servo piston rods.
Steam Power.
In steam power plants, MJTs are used on boiler feed pump head and barrel casings, boiler circ pump main flanges, stop valves, control valves, turbine couplings, stay rods, manway doors, inlet flanges, and feedwater heaters. MJTs can save a lot of time during scheduled downtime or maintenance because they require less time to install and remove than other bolting methods.
Steel Mill.
Multi-jackbolt tensioners have a number of uses in the Steel industry. Thrust collars can be used on rolling mills, which makes changing the rolls much easier than other methods, and frees up crane time because only hand tools are required. Other MJTs are used on mill motors, bearings, shaft mounts, anchor bolts, and slitter knives.
Petrochemical.
In the petrochemical industry, multi-jackbolt tensioners have been used on reactor vessels, heat exchanger heads, turbine control valves, turbine joints, pipe flanges, anchor bolts, couplings, compressors, and pumps.

Crataegus mexicana

Crataegus mexicana is a species of hawthorn known by the common names tejocote, manzanita, tejocotera and Mexican hawthorn. It is native to the mountains of Mexico and parts of Guatemala, and has been introduced in the Andes. The fruit of this species is one of the most useful among hawthorns.
Crataegus pubescens Steud. is a nomenclaturally illegitimate name (for "Crataegus gracilior" J.B.Phipps) that is commonly misapplied to this species.
Description.
The plant is a large shrub or small tree growing to 5–10 m tall, with a dense crown. The leaves are semi-evergreen, oval to diamond-shaped, 4–8 cm long, with a serrated margin. The flowers are off-white, 2 cm diameter. The fruit is a globose to oblong orange-red pome 2 cm long and 1.5 cm diameter, ripening in late winter only shortly before the flowers of the following year.
Uses.
The fruit is eaten in Mexico cooked, raw, or canned. It resembles a crabapple, but it has three or sometimes more brown hard stones in the center. It is a main ingredient used in "ponche", the traditional Mexican hot fruit punch that is served at Christmas time and on New Year's Eve. On Day of the Dead tejocote fruit as well as candy prepared from them are used as offerings to the dead, and rosaries made of the fruit are part of altar decorations. A mixture of tejocote paste, sugar, and chili powder produces a popular Mexican candy called "rielitos", because it resembles a tiny train rail.
Due to its high pectin content, the fruit is industrially processed to extract pectin for the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, textile and metal industries.
Other uses include food for livestock (for which the leaves and fruits are used) and traditional medicinal uses; a Mexican hawthorn root infusion is used as a diuretic and as a remedy for diarrhea, and fruit-based preparations are a remedy for coughing and several heart conditions.
The Mexican hawthorn tree's wood is hard and compact, it is good for making tool handles as well as for firewood.
Nomenclature.
The name "C. pubescens" Steud., published in 1840, is a better-known name for this species, but is illegitimate under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. It is a later homonym of "C. pubescens" C.Presl which was published in 1826 as the name of a species from Sicily.

Regiment de la Rey

Regiment de la Rey (abbreviated to RDLR) is an infantry battalion of the South African Army. As a reserve force unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Territorial Army or United States Army National Guard unit.
Formation.
The Regiment de la Rey was established in 1934 as one of the new Afrikaans language Citizen Force units of the Union Defence Force. 
The regimental badge depicts a lion's head, in memory of Boer General JH de la Rey, the 'Lion of the West' after whom the regiment is named.
Before the Second World War, battalion headquarters were at Rustenburg in the Transvaal. The unit had company headquarters at Potchefstroom, Klerksdorp and Ventersdorp, with a support company at Brits.
Mrs J E Morkel, daughter of General De la Rey, became the first honorary colonel of the regiment.
The regiment was affiliated to the Northamptonshire Regiment of the British Army.
World War II.
RDLR was called up for full-time service on 18 July 1940. Because the commanding officer, Lt-Col (later Brig) H P van Noorden, was by then commanding a battalion of the Field Force Brigade, command of the regiment passed to Lt-Col WD Basson.
The regiment was amalgamated with the Witwatersrand Rifles. After training in Egypt, the new unit, Wits-delaRey (WR/DLR) made a name for itself as one of the motorised infantry battalions of the 12th Motorised Brigade in the 6th South African Armoured Division in Italy in 1944–45.
For almost the entire Italian campaign RDLR was commanded by Lt-Col Jack Bester, until he was appointed to command the newly formed 13th Motorised Brigade.
The regiment distinguished itself particularly in taking Allerona on 15 June 1944, in fighting on Monte Querciabella and Monte Fili, and in forcing the River Greve in July 1944.
WR/DLR were the first on Monte Stanco in the Apennines in October 1944 and scored a spectacular success in the final offensive in Italy when they took Monte Caprara on 16 April 1945.
The unit's casualties were among the heaviest in the division. During the Italian campaign 119 soldiers were killed, 576 wounded and 17 were posted missing in action.
On 1 January 1960 the regiment was renamed Regiment Wes-Transvaal with headquarters at Potchefstroom. After objections and strenuous efforts it resumed its original designation as Regiment De la Rey on 1 September 1966.
Captain 'Doempie' Cloete.
Captain MDV Cloete, nicknamed Doempie, was a pastor in the Dutch Reformed Church who served as regimental chaplain from February 1943 until the end of the war. He was a talented rugby player with a most devastating tackle, an enthusiastic hockey player and, on route marches, would outperform many of the tough infantrymen.
In June 1944, the chaplain captured two German soldiers who had been deliberately left behind near the village of Allerona to harass officers of the Allied High Command. Upon discovering their hidden position behind some bushes to the side of a road, Doempie pushed the bush aside and shouted to the two men in Afrikaans: "Kom uit kêrels – die oorlog is op 'n einde" ('Come out, guys – the war is over'). They heeded his instructions and surrendered. The only ‘weapon' the chaplain had with him was his short officer's cane.
After World War II, he remained in the Union Defence Force and served as chaplain in various units. From November 1950 to December 1953, he accompanied 2 Squadron SAAF, 'The Flying Cheetahs', to Korea which was South Africa's contribution to the United Nations war effort.
In 1960, the Minister of Justice and the Commissioner of Police determined that there was a need for a well organised Chaplain Corps in the South African Police (SAP). Cloete was appointed Chaplain-General with the rank of colonel to establish the Corps.
He retired from the South African Police in February 1975 with the rank of major-general.
On his retirement, he was the most highly decorated member of the SAP. In addition to the 'usual' 1939–1945 campaign medals, he had also been awarded the Military Cross, the Korean Order of Military Merit, 'Ulchi', the American Bronze Star and numerous SAP medals and decorations.
The Border War.
The regiment participated in the South African Border War, also known as the Namibian War of Independence, the conflict that took place from 1966 to 1989 in South-West Africa (now Namibia) and Angola between South Africa and its allied forces (mainly UNITA) and the Angolan government, South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO), and their allies the Soviet Union and Cuba.
Operation Packer.
Operation Hooper, in which the main participants were Permanent Force and National Service members, officially ended on 13 March 1988. A Citizen Force call up provided fresh troops into the SADF-UNITA force which had been tasked to drive People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) forces from Cuito Cuanavale. This injection of fresh troops allowed Operation Hooper to move seamlessly into Operation Packer. The objective of the operation was to drive the combined FAPLA/Cuban force back across the Cuito River to the west bank.
The primary assault force which was to 'drive the enemy' out of Tumpo consisted of 13 Olifant tanks with crews from Regiment President Steyn, a squadron of Ratel 90's from Regiment Mooirivier (RMR), a mechanised infantry battalion from Regiment de la Rey and from Regiment Great Karoo, three companies from 32 Battalion, three UNITA regular battalions and two semi-regular UNITA battalions plus a number of other components.
Post-1994.
The regiment is one of only six mechanised units in the SANDF Reserve Force.
1 RDLR took part in the 50th anniversary parade of Regiment Mooirivier in Potchefstroom on 23 July 2004.
2 SA Infantry Battalion, situated in Zeerust, deployed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) from October 2005 to May 2006. A full company of 1 Regiment De La Rey (1RDLR) deployed with them. one mortar platoon 1RDLR – KMDT BOET SCHOEMAN

Park's Quest

Park’s Quest is a 1988 children's novel written by American novelist Katherine Paterson.
Plot summary.
Park's full name is Parkington Waddell Broughton V. He knows he has ancestors who have distinguished themselves and the name he shares with four generations of them. But his father, a U.S. Marine Corps pilot, died in Vietnam when Park was three, and he has never met his father's family. Though he is nearly twelve, his mother still avoids answering any questions about his father. Finally, to satisfy his curiosity, Park gets on a bus for the short ride from his home to the Vietnam Memorial in Washington DC. There he finds his father's name. There he also resolves to get some of his questions solved.
After a painful conversation, his mother puts him on a bus for a two-week vacation in south-western Virginia where his grandfather and uncle maintain the farm on which his father grew up. His grandfather has had a stroke and is now inarticulate, able to communicate in only the most rudimentary ways. His uncle has a Vietnamese wife, and shares his home with a Vietnamese girl about Park's age whose origin and status is not clear to Park until he discovers, after a number of uncomfortable encounters, that she is his half-sister, and that because of his father's infidelity, his mother divorced him before his second, and fatal, term in Vietnam. Park, whose fantasies about his father's past and his own future have been highly romanticized, does some important growing up in the short visit that puts him in touch with a more complex idea of family, grief, forgiveness, and acceptance than he has ever before had to develop.

New City School

New City School is a non-sectarian, co-educational independent elementary school in St. Louis, Missouri. It was founded in 1969 by a group of parents interested in creating a progressive school in the then-struggling Central West End area of St. Louis. It practices a progressive approach to education based on the theory of multiple intelligences. It is housed in a renovated turn-of-the-century school building in the Central West End of St. Louis. The school’s stated goals are “Academic Excellence, Personal Intelligence, Diversity Beyond the Numbers, and Joyful Learning”. The emphasis on diversity is reflected by the student population which is 33% students of color.
Educational approach.
In 1988, New City School began using the theory of multiple intelligences developed by psychologist Howard Gardner. Gardner’s theory suggests that the traditional definition of intelligence does not encompass the many areas of human ability. The eight intelligences Gardner identified are verbal-linguistic, logical-mathematical, visual-spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalist. New City School classrooms use teaching techniques that draw on a student’s natural strengths to present new material.
New City School was the second school to incorporate Multiple Intelligences theory in the classroom (after The Key School in Indianapolis). It has become a model for other schools seeking to employ the principles of Multiple Intelligences. The school has hosted four MI conferences, and 500-700 educators visit each year from around the world to observe the teaching techniques used at New City School. In 2007, visitors came from Mexico, Argentina, Australia, and six states in the U.S. The current principal is Thomas Hoerr who has published two books ("The Art of School Leadership" and "Becoming A Multiple Intelligences School") and more than 60 articles on education and the implementation of Multiple Intelligences theory. 
The 39 full-time faculty members have an average of 18 years of teaching experience and more than 50% hold advanced degrees. Specialists include Science, Spanish, Library, Music and Movement, Performing Arts, Computer Science, Physical Education, and Art. The Student-Teacher Ratio is 13 to 1. New City School is accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS).
Tuition.
Tuition is $13,650 per year ($9,650 for part-time pre-school). Nearly $750,000 in need-based scholarships were awarded in 2008-09 to more than 36% of families. More than $3,500,000 has been raised for a Financial Aid Endowment fund. A multiple intelligences library opened in 2005 as the result of a $2,000,000 capital campaign.

A Leopard Lives in a Muu Tree

"A Leopard Lives in a Muu Tree" is a poem by the Kenyan poet Jonathan Kariara. It concerns a native farmer besieged by a tree-bound leopard that has apparently broken his fences, torn his medicine bags and stifled his wives' sensuality. Featured in such poesy anthologies as "An Introduction to East African Poetry", "The Penguin Book of Modern African Poetry" and "Over This Soil", it has been subjected to a wide range of interpretations, most of them erotic.
Summary.
The poem begins with the line that also constitutes its title, adding that the leopard's gaze is fixed on the home of the speaker, whose lambs(read children) are born with speckles and whose wives "tie their skirts tight / And turn away" (4-5), fearing that (presumably through the leopard's voracious attentions) they might spawn similarly stippled offspring. Nonetheless, while bathing late at night, "when the moon is high" (7), they make an exhibition of themselves, splashing the "cold mountain stream water on their nipples" (9), removing their skirts and imprecating loudly. Realizing that he is besieged and resolving to fell the Muu tree, the speaker walks about "stiff / Stroking my loins." (14-15)
From its residence outside his homestead, the leopard is seen eyeing the women. The speaker recalls addressing it as "elder" (18) and "one-from-the-same-womb" (18), but it holds its head high and merely peers at him "with slit eyes" (19). The speaker's sword has corroded in its sheath, and his wives, whenever the owls emit their mating call, do nothing but purse their lips. Again the speaker deplores his besieging.
Although the wives "fetch cold mountain water" (25) and "crush the sugar cane" (26), they decline to touch their husband's "beer horn" (27). With his fences broken, his medicine bags torn and the post at his gate fallen, speaker's pubic hair is swinged. Presently, the leopard arches over the homestead, and the wives become frisky. The final two lines detail the former's lamb feast, which resuscitates it.
The speaker uses the imagery of a leopard to mean stealthy and dangerous, he goes further to suggest that they are of the same womb where we can infer here he speaks of a brother older and with more status than he. The personas lambs are born with speckles suggesting that he, the elder, has already spawn children with the personas wives and he the persona has not had relations with them as he, the elder, visits upon his home frequently, this suggested by the line "the leopard arches over the homestead, and the wives become frisky".

Saving Room for Dessert

Saving Room for Dessert is a crime novel by the American writer K.C. Constantine set in 1990s Rocksburg, a fictional, blue-collar, Rustbelt town in Western Pennsylvania (modeled on the author's hometown of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Pittsburgh).
Constantine's earlier novels followed the exploits of police chief Mario Balzic and detective Rugs Carlucci of the Rocksburg police department; this one departs from the pattern by shadowing three beat cops: William Rayford, Robert Canoza, and James Reseta.
It is the seventeenth book in the 17-volume Rocksburg series.

Mount Shasta Wilderness

The Mount Shasta Wilderness is a federally designated wilderness area located east of Mount Shasta City in northern California. The US Congress passed the 1984 California Wilderness Act that set aside the Mount Shasta Wilderness. The US Forest Service is the managing agency as the wilderness is within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The area is named for and is dominated by the Mount Shasta volcano which reaches a traditionally quoted height of above sea level, but official sources give values ranging from from one USGS project, to via the NOAA. Mount Shasta is one of only two peaks in the state over outside the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. The other summit is White Mountain Peak in the Great Basin of east-central California.
The Wintun Glacier is located on Mount Shasta and is the lowest-elevation glacier in the state, lying at elevation and extending to the summit. 
The smaller volcanic cone of Shastina (12,270 ft) lies one mile (1.6 km) west of Mount Shasta and was formed after the ice-age glaciers melted.
The wilderness protects both pristine forests and areas that were intensively logged and roaded
in the past. Although less than half of the mountain remains roadless, Mount Shasta Wilderness is still the premier destination for a variety of activities from mountaineering, day-hiking, and backpacking to cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and ski mountaineering. It is valued for the many scenic, geologic and recreational attributes including glaciers, lava flows, hot springs, waterfalls and forests of Shasta red fir, sugar pine and other conifers.
Recreation.
Being a high, solitary and very large mountain with a base diameter of , Mount Shasta can create its own weather patterns which hikers must be aware of. Also, falling rocks are a major danger above timberline. The best time of year for hiking Mount Shasta is June and July, when routes are still snow-covered. Although there is no designated trail to the summit, many cross-country routes ascend to the mountaintop and all require experience in traversing ice and snow. 
There are ten trailheads giving access to the wilderness and several short trails leading up the slopes of Mount Shasta with the so-called Shasta Summit Trail (or Avalanche Gulch) being the most popular. This trail, although the "easiest" of the routes, still requires the use of ice axe and crampons. There are four major glaciers and three smaller glaciers radiating from the summit in addition to lava flows on the northern flank composed of andesite and basalt. 
A parking permit is required as well as a free wilderness permit and, if attempting a hike above , a Summit Pass for each climber must be purchased. Human waste must be packed out, and all principles of Leave No Trace etiquette employed. Some restrictions include no dogs in the wilderness, a limit of 10 people in a group and no wood campfires.
Flora and fauna.
Forested areas include pure stands of red fir as well as mixed conifer forests of white fir, Douglas-fir, sugar pine, incense cedar and at higher elevations, western white pine. The lava flows on the northeast flank have mountain mahogany and juniper. Underbrush consists of pinemat manzanita, greenleaf manzanita, tanoak, chinquapin, and snowbrush. From to timberline are krummholz forms of whitebark pine.
Wildlife include the ubiquitous black bear, coyote, ground squirrel, deer, Golden eagles, prairie falcons and red-tail hawks.
Common wildflowers are Shasta lily, miner's lettuce, showy phlox and mountain violet among others.
Notable rare plants in the Mount Shasta Wilderness and surrounding area include Mt. Shasta arnica ("Arnica viscosa"), Siskiyou Indian paintbrush ("Castilleja miniata" ssp. "elata") and Shasta owl's clover ("Orthocarpus pachystachyus"). The Siskiyou Indian paintbrush is hemiparasitic, meaning that the plant obtains water and nutrients from the roots of other plants, then manufactures food by photosynthesis. The Shasta owl's clover ("Orthocarpus pachystachyus") of the "Scrophulariaceae" family is critically imperiled and was believed to be extinct. First described in 1848 by Harvard University botanist Asa Gray, the plant was not collected again until 1913. Known only from two reports from the Shasta Valley of northern California, it could not be relocated despite repeated searches of the moist meadows and vernal pools where it was thought originally to have been found. In May, 1996, botanist Dean Taylor of the University of California, Berkeley, rediscovered the evasive plant on the higher, drier ground of a sagebrush-covered hillside. But even in this habitat the wildflower appears to be extraordinarily rare. Taylor was able to find only eight individual plants of the owl’s-clover.
Sierra Club camp.
The Sierra Club maintains a private parcel called Horse Camp within the wilderness.
It is used as a base camp for summit attempts, and offers a shelter called the Shasta Alpine Lodge, dedicated in 1923 and built from surrounding volcanic rock and Shasta red fir wood. Horse Camp is staffed during the climbing season from May to September, has a seasonal spring for water and is a traditional destination of many elementary school trips from Siskiyou County schools.
Also at Horse Camp is the half-mile-long Olberman Causeway, a stone walkway built in the 1920s by the first caretaker, Mac Olberman from rocks of the surrounding area.

Harold Keenan (born 20 December 1893, date of death unknown) was an English professional footballer. He spent his entire professional career with Blackpool in the early 1900s, making over 100 Football League appearances for the club. He played as a defender.
Blackpool.
Warrington-born Keenan made his debut for Blackpool on 25 January 1913, in a 4–2 defeat at Fulham. It was his only appearance of the 1912–13 season.
He also made one league appearance the following season, 1913–14, in a goalless draw against Notts County at Bloomfield Road on 13 April 1914, fifteen months after his first start for the club.
Keenan didn't make any appearances in 1914–15; however, in 1917–18, the third season of regional football during World War I, Keenan was ever-present in Blackpool's 36 games in the principal and subsidiary competitions. He also scored three goals.
The following season, 1918–19, the final season of inter-war football, Bill Norman was installed as Blackpool's first full-time manager. He selected Keenan in 33 of the club's 37 games.
Football League programmes returned for 1919–20, and Keenan made 35 starts in Blackpool's 42 league games. He also helped steer the club to the third round of the FA Cup, at which point they were knocked out by arch-rivals Preston North End.
In 1920–21, Keenan was again ever-present. He also scored his first League goals for the club. The first came in the opening game of the season, a 2–2 draw at Bury on 28 August. The second was in a 2–0 victory at Rotherham County on 12 February. His third was the only goal of the game at Port Vale on 26 February.
Keenan's appearances were limited in 1921–22, with just fifteen league starts.
In 1922–23, Keenan's final season with Blackpool, he appeared in just the first seven league games, the final one being a 2–1 defeat at home to Southampton on 23 September, in front of a crowd of 13,500.

Alexandra (poem)

"Alexandra" is a poem by South African poet and writer Mongane Wally Serote.
Serote's poems about places, particularly his Alexandra poems, grapple with the problems of squalor, violence, death, destitution, exploitation and the Black People’s quest for identity and a sense of community. In the poem Alexandra, the speaker's inner-child addresses his 'mother'; "Alexandra, my beginning was knotted to you, just like you knot my destiny". Alexandra (the place) is forever connected to the speaker, just like a mother would be forever connected to her child. The personification of Alexandra (the place) as mother-figure allows the speaker to emphasise the bond he has with the place; wherever he goes he carries the 'throb' of Alexandra deep within him - it has made him who he is. He was nourished on the "dirty waters of (her) dongas" and when he is thirsty he cries out for this 'mother', this mother who frightens him and whom he suspects to be cruel. He pleads for answers from this 'mother'; "Do you love me Alexandra?" and "What have you done to me?" Despite not receiving answers he cannot leave although others have distanced themselves from the memories and walked over him to go to "far places". He is a product of his roots, he has been shaped by this 'mother' Alexandra, and he acknowledges that in the end he will always find his way back to her to lie amid the rubble, "simple and black". The speaker of the poem creates an image to the reader, what his life was like during the apartheid times in South Africa.

Democrats Really

Democrats Really ("Democratici Davvero") is a faction within the Democratic Party (PD), a political party in Italy.
The group, whose leader is Rosy Bindi, basically includes Christian left politicians and social democrats. They have been close supporters of Romano Prodi and wanted the party to stick to the tradition of The Olive Tree, along with the Ulivists.
In the 2007 primary election for choosing the party leader, most Ulivists, supported Rosy Bindi, along with Agazio Loiero's Southern Democratic Party and some members of The Populars, a loose association of former members of the Italian People's Party of which also Bindi was a member. Ulivists had their strongholds in Northern Italy, and especially in Veneto, Lombardy and Piedmont, but however Bindi, who obtained 12.9% of the vote in the primary election nationally, had her best result in Calabria (31.3%) thanks to Loiero's support.
In July 2008 Bindi and her group (Giovanni Bachelet, Gianfranco Morgando, Roberto Zaccaria, Marina Magistrelli, Nando Dalla Chiesa) broke with the core Ulivists, who were much more critical of the political line of Walter Veltroni's party leadership and of the lack of internal democracy within the party.
In the 2009 Democratic Party leadership election the faction supported Pier Luigi Bersani. Bersani won and Bindi was elected president of the party.

Since the 1970s, he has been known for his commitment to environmental restoration. He is best known for his restoration of a limestone quarry wasteland in Mombasa, Kenya, into the nature park and wildlife sanctuary named Haller Park. 
Haller is a recipient of a number of awards. He was one of the first recipients of the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honor by the United Nations for his 'outstanding environmental achievements. He is well known as author of many publications on his wasteland rehabilitation work. He is a Trustee of the Haller Foundation, the Director of The Baobab Trust, and interim Chair of the Kenyan Wildlife Service Board of Trustees.
Early life.
Rene Haller was born in Lenzburg, Switzerland in 1933. During his time in Switzerland, he did an apprenticeship as a gardener and specialized in landscaping.
Career.
In 1956, Haller came to Africa to supervise a coffee plantation on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. In 1959, He was recruited by the Bamburi Cement Company to head up their Garden Department. He was assigned to produce food (fruit and vegetables) for Bamburi factory workers. He was also assigned to beautify the area surrounding the site
In the 1970s, Haller began an ecological experiment to rehabilitate the limestone quarries scarring the Mombasa coastline. Today Haller has transformed much of the 7 square kilometer Bamburi site from an infertile and dusty landscape to an ecological haven. The quarries are now a combination of lakes, wetlands and savannah grasslands with walking and cycling trails. In 2002, nearly 100,000 visitors came to the Nature Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.
Under Haller's leadership, the Garden department expanded as poultry, sheep and goats were included in production. By 1977 it had become economically self-sustaining which encouraged Rene to incorporate Baobab Farm.

Rocky Mountain (film)

Rocky Mountain is a 1950 western film directed by William Keighley and starring Errol Flynn. It takes place near the end of the American Civil War.
Plot.
In the opening shot, a car pulls up to an historical marker in the desert that reads:
ROCKY MOUNTAIN, also known as Ghost Mountain. On March 26, 1865, a detachment of Confederate cavalry crossed the state line into California under secret orders from Gen. Robert E. Lee to rendezvous at Ghost Mountain with one Cole Smith, with instructions to place the flag atop the mountain, and though their mission failed, the heroism displayed by these gallant men honored the cause for which they fought so valiantly.
Eight horsemen trek across the California desert, arriving at Ghost Mountain. Led by Captain Lafe Barstow of the Mississippi Mounted Rifles, the eight encounter a man calling himself California Beal, an envoy from Cole Smith. Barstow's mission is to persuade Smith and his 500 men to raid California on behalf of the Confederacy as a last desperate effort to turn the tide of the war. From their vantage point on the mountain, the men see a Shoshone war party attack a stagecoach. Barstow's men charge and drive off the Shoshone after the stage overturns, rescuing driver Gil Craigie and the only surviving passenger, Johanna Carter, traveling to join her fiancé, Union Army officer Lt. Rickey.
That night, the Indians burn the stage. Next morning, a detachment of four Union soldiers and three Shoshone scouts examine the ashes. Barstow's men ambush the detachment, killing one and capturing the rest, including Lt. Rickey. From them, Barstow learns that the Union knows about their presence in California and that California Beal is actually Cole Smith himself. Smith leaves, promising to return in two days with his men. Craigie talks with the Shoshone scouts and learns that they are really a chief, Man Dog, and his sons. He warns Barstow that they will escape and return with their tribe. That night, while Jimmy is on watch, the Indians try to escape. The soldiers kill two of them, but Man Dog evades their bullets.
In the morning, Rickey suggests that he take Johanna to a nearby garrison before the Indians arrive. Barstow, however, hopes that Smith's men will come before the Indians do and rejects the suggestion. Near dawn, Rickey's men jump their guards. One dies in the attempt, and another recaptured, but Rickey makes his escape. The Southerners find a riderless horse but it turns out to be Smith's, not Rickey's, and they realize that help is not coming.
Barstow decides to use all his men to lure the Indians away from the mountain while Johanna, Craigie and the Union trooper escape. The greatly outnumbered Rebels ride into a box canyon and turn to fight, charging the Shoshone. During the battle, Rickey returns with a troop of Union cavalry, and Johanna tells Rickey what has happened. The cavalry attempt to save Barstow's men but are too late; all the Southerners have been killed. Rickey raises their rebel flag on top of Rocky Mountain to salute the bravery of their fallen foes.
Production.
The film was originally titled "Ghost Mountain". Ronald Reagan badly wanted to play the lead but it was given to Errol Flynn, who was announced as star early. Lauren Bacall was assigned to play the female lead under her contract with Warner Bros but turned it down and was suspended as a result. She was replaced by Patrice Wymore.
During filming Flynn fell in love with Wymore and later married her.
Reception.
The film earned £125,231 at the English box office.
According to James Garner, the script for the movie was used as the basis for the first episode of the TV series "Maverick".

Doctors.net.uk

Doctors.net.uk is an online network for doctors in the UK and one of the first of any networking sites to be introduced on the web.
Founded by Dr. Neil Bacon (also the founder of iWantGreatCare) in 1998, the site offers a number of Web 2.0 features which allows doctors to communicate online – including email, an interactive forum, online training, e-learning, medical podcasts and access to an online medical textbook and medical image library [http://dmweekly.mad.co.uk/Main/Home/Articles/ffecf0a457ef4acbbabe20f1bf8ef1cb/Doctorsnet-tests-new-Flickr-style-image-library.html.
Access is only granted to UK registered doctors and medical students, and it claims to have a membership of more than 160,000 doctors – more than 95% of all UK doctors.
More than 30,000 UK doctors log onto the site every day using its email, forums and professional development services.
The company is funded by allowing communication from private companies (such as pharmaceutical companies) and government bodies (such as the NHS and Department of Health) to its members.
On the commercial side, it provides communication campaigns for pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, the Department of Health and other public sector organisations and medical colleges, providing them with effective access to doctors for marketing, education, training and market research.
The company, based in Milton Park, Oxfordshire, was acquired in August 2011 by the Tokyo listed M3 corporation, at which time it had over 180,000 doctor members.
News.
In August 2008, a row over doctors' freedom of speech was erupted after a trainee doctor was suspended for making offensive comments about a senior medical figure on the Doctors.net.uk forum. The comments, allegedly about the re-election of Dame Carol Black as the chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges – were made by a trainee in general surgery who was subsequently suspended from the Highland Deanery. Doctors.net.uk removed the offensive part of the posting as soon as it was alerted to it.[http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&storycode=4120357&c=2]
Awards.
In November 2008, Doctors.net.uk received a prestigious e-Learning Award for its work for the Department of Health (DH). The award, 'Best e-learning project securing widespread adoption' was a tribute to the work carried out by Doctors.net.uk in trying to reduce healthcare associated infections (HCAI) such as MRSA and C Difficile in UK hospitals.[http://www.pr-inside.com/doctors-net-uk-wins-prestigious-e-learning-r913958.htm]

Elizabeth Lilburne

Elizabeth Lilburne (fl. 1641–1660), born Elizabeth Dewell, was a Leveller and the wife of John Lilburne.
Life.
The daughter of the London merchant Henry Dewell (d. in or after 1655), no details of Elizabeth's life prior to her marriage to John in or before September 1641 (shortly after his release from prison) are known. Already involved in London separatist circles at the time of her marriage, she was one of the thirteen women and sixteen men arrested in September 1641 for their attendance at John Spilsbury's Baptist congregation in Stepney. Her husband's politically active life, leading to frequent spells in prison (often with Elizabeth alongside him) and some time in exile, dominated her life and made for much lobbying and hardship for her. During John's time serving as a captain in Lord Brooke's regiment he was captured at Brentford by royalists and threatened with execution - Elizabeth not only managed to petition parliament to threaten to hang tit-for-tat executions of royalist prisoners if her husband was executed, but also carried a letter of this news from the Speaker of the House of Commons to the Royalist court in exile in Oxford whilst pregnant. After John's release she spent a few quieter months in Boston, Lincolnshire while he was serving with the army of the Eastern Association, though he became more and more disaffected with the dominant parliamentary factions. Heavily pregnant, she joined him in Newgate Prison in August 1645 when he was sent there for attacking William Lenthall and it was there that their daughter Elizabeth was born and (maybe against the couple's wishes) baptised. Elizabeth's childbed linen was in the meantime stolen from the couple's London home by parliamentary officers hunting for "dangerous Bookes". Between then and 1649 they also had two sons.
John was imprisoned again in 1646-48 for attacking presbyterian and parliamentarian authoritarianism and in March to July 1649 - during the former period Elizabeth was herself arrested for circulating John's books, and it was her catching smallpox (as did the couple's 3 children - the two sons died but the daughter survived) that led to his bail at the end of the latter. Elizabeth recovered and went on to have seven more children, though only two of these (plus their first daughter) reached adulthood. She became ill again in October 1649 and was unable to be present on John's acquittal of treason by a London jury. The following 18 months were peaceful for the couple, living partly off the proceeds of confiscated Durham church lands John had been granted in compensation for his 1630s punishments, but they came to ruin through the exile and £7000 fine imposed on John in January 1652 after his conviction for libel by parliament after an attack on Sir Arthur Haselrig's administration of sequestered north-eastern estates. The prominent Baptist William Kiffin was an old friend of John and a former political ally, and it was to him that Elizabeth was entrusted during John's exile. She tried to convince him to reconcile himself to Oliver Cromwell, if only for their family's sake, visiting him in Bruges and convincing him to return to England in June 1653. He was, however, imprisoned on arrival and remained there until his death apart from brief paroles, though two more children were born in 1652-53 (he criticised her for being "perfectly distracted" by the death of one of their children in this period). John's father and Elizabeth tried and failed in July 1655 to have him released, with themselves as guarantors of his good behaviour, and he was moved from Jersey to Dover before dying in Eltham on 29 August 1657 on bail after his wife's last confinement.
In his last years John became a Quaker but it seems from his writings that he was not joined in this by Elizabeth. In his exile writings he called her arguments to him to return to be "mournful", the terms on which she recommended compromise as "sneaking terms my soul abhorres [sic" and Elizabeth herself as "my poor credulous wife". However, her arguments were vindicated after his death when she eventually managed to gain from Cromwell the lifting of the 1652 fine, the renewal of a weekly pension of 40s. for herself and her children and help in settling disputes over the Durham property. Her pension was still being paid in March 1660, though the improvement in her fortunes probably ended with the English Restoration. With John's obstinacy now removed, she also managed to resolve the Lilburnes' complex property disputes in Durham, so much so that Hesilrige became an ally in Parliament (in return for her giving him all the papers relating to his original dispute with John).

Caroline August Chandler

Caroline Augusta Chandler (1906-1979) was a descendant of the Chandler family and was a notable doctor, author and a pioneer in the medical field for many women. Her efforts to recruit more young women in the field of science included writing books for young girls about the profession. The character in some of her books mirrored Chandler’s own life with the exception that she never got married in real life. Her career ended with her resignation to the Maryland State Health Department because her proposals were being completely blocked or indefinitely delayed.
Education.
She attended Mt Aloysius Academy in Cresson, Pennsylvania and from there went to Barnard College, then Yale Medical School where she won awards in medical research and pediatrics. Her graduation at Yale in 1933 was accompanied by varied music at the ceremony because the unions refused to play. She later continued research at Harvard Medical School and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
Career.
During World War II, Dr. Chandler left the laboratory to carry out a special project for the Children’s Bureau in Washington, D.C. and was commissioned Surgeon in the United States Public Health Service. After the war, Dr. Chandler returned to Johns Hopkins as a full-time Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, but as her interests in community groups and agencies grew, she had to limit her work to part-time. After serving three years as medical director of the Family and Children’s Society, she accepted an assignment with the Maryland State Department of Health as a director of a combined program of mental health and child health. In 1961, Chandler joined the staff at the National Institute of Mental Health as chief of Demonstrations Section of the Communities Services Branch. She headed the Child Mental Health Section of the Community Research and Services Branch of the NIMH. During all of these assignments, she remained an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and Instructor of Mental Hygiene at Johns Hopkins.

WJE personnel are specialized in architectural, structural, and civil engineering; materials conservation, chemistry and petrography, and testing and instrumentation.
History.
1956–1970: Beginning Years.
Jack R. Janney originally established WJE in 1956 as Janney and Associates, earlier that year, President Dwight D. Eisenhower enacted the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, authorizing the construction of over 40,000 miles of roads for the interstate highway system. Working for the Portland Cement Association (PCA), Janney was recognized for his knowledge of prestressed concrete by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority and was offered a consulting position for a new construction project utilizing full scale load testing. During this time, Janney established his own firm with fellow engineer and neighbor Jack Wiss. In 1957, the company became Wiss and Janney Associates. In 1961, former PCA colleague Dick Elstner joined the company and it was renamed Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.
Shortly thereafter, the United States National Academy of Sciences retained WJE to conduct full-scale load tests at the site of the 1964 New York World's Fair.
1991-2000.
WJE participated in the reconstruction of the ill-fated TWA Flight 800, which exploded shortly after take off on July 17, 1996. The reconstructed aircraft segment was featured in many television news broadcasts and publications. Additionally, over a period of twelve years, WJE led a multidisciplinary team that assisted the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. with assessing and addressing issues of deterioration and obsolescence. 
2000-Present.
WJE continued to undertake many new assignments, including the investigation of Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial, restoration services at the New York Public Library, plaza investigation and repair services for the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, facade restoration of the American Museum of Natural History, comprehensive planning studies for Aloha Stadium, and a condition assessment and materials evaluation following the I-580 connector collapse at the MacArthur Maze. 
In August 2006, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts retained WJE to undertake a comprehensive safety audit of the Central Artery/Tunnel project, also known as the "Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)". WJE engineers, architects, and materials scientists completed the stem-to-stern safety audit in ninety days.
In August 2007, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) retained WJE to conduct an investigation following the collapse of the I-35W Bridge to determine the cause of the collapse. WJE was responsible for planning and overseeing the removal and dismantlement of all structural components so the NTSB and other investigators could examine and record conditions at the site.
In August 2011, the National Park Service retained WJE to assess earthquake damage to the Washington Monument following the August 24 earthquake. In September, members of WJE's Difficult Access Team rappelled from the Monument's exterior over the course of several days to visually inspect for damage.

Spagic

Spagic is a Universal Middleware, characterized by an innovative approach to the governance and realization of SOA solutions, which are highly modular and configurable around an "OSGi" (Open Service Gateway initiative) kernel.
All the actors involved in integration processes: analysts, planners, developers and managers working with Spagic; a team can model some processes and another one can define technical concepts with specific tools, such as BPMN Processes, OSGi services and connectors, BPEL, mapping, ETL.
All activities can span over organizations and geographical locations.
Spagic model enhances the features of some engines to realize a complete ESB/BPM platform and allows to compose the platform with different ESBs and it provides support for different process types, through the Eclipse STP Intermediate Model (that is moving under the project Eclipse Mangrove): workflow orchestration of human and automatic activities, BPEL orchestration and data integration oriented services.
Spagic provides out of the box SOA/ESB and BPM capabilities to end users/developers through its graphical environment: Spagic Studio is the Eclipse integrated development environment to define the policies, design the processes, create new services, deploy and configure the platform in different environments (test and production).
Using Spagic Studio it is possible to start with a BPMN visual tool, eventually to use specific designer (such as BPEL designer) and to manage all the developing activity (such as: WSDL generation, rules definition, mediation, custom services). 
For the management of user activities in workflow processes, an integration with Orbeon Forms is available. This feature allows the user to design complex Web forms and use them within Spagic workflow processes.
Spagic provides a web environment, Spagic Enterprise Monitoring, that allows to manage the processes, the instances and their correlation, identify the problems, restart the processes with errors, identify the business values added by services and to support the decisions.
A project called Eclipse eBPM has been recently created within the Eclipse foundation: this project will became the Spagic core, that will be contributed to the Eclipse foundation under the Eclipse Public License.
Released under the GNU LGPL license and EPL, Spagic is hosted by OW2 Consortium and by the Eclipse Foundation for the STP Intermediate Model.

Frontline (ministry)

Frontline was the young adult ministry of McLean Bible Church, a non-denominational evangelical Christian church with campuses throughout the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Frontline was started in 1994 and has an average weekly attendance of over 2500 between its multiple campuses. John McGowan is the current Director and Teaching Pastor for Frontline. In early 2011 John stepped up for Todd Phillips, Frontline's previous Teaching Pastor. Todd Phillips now teaches at Lake Pointe Church; a multi-site church outside of Dallas, Texas.
History.
McLean Bible Church, one of the largest churches in the Washington, DC region, launched Frontline in October 1994 as a Sunday evening worship service. Since inception, the goal of Frontline is to minister to young adults, ages 18 – 35, in the nation’s capital region through worship, small group fellowship and volunteer opportunities. 
Initially, Lon Solomon, the senior pastor of McLean Bible Church, preached during the services . During the summer of 1995, the director of Frontline, Ken Baugh, began to preach during the services while Solomon was on vacation for the summer. Baugh, the former Young Adults Pastor at Saddleback Church in California, was a success and remained the permanent teaching pastor. Baugh oversaw steady growth of this new ministry from an average attendance of 300 in 1995 to 2000 in 2000. The new worshippers credited this growth to Baugh’s efforts to make Frontline relevant to young adults through music, sermons and videos.
Ken Baugh became pastor of Coast Hills Community Church in California, which led to Todd Phillips’ promotion to pastor of Frontline in January 2005. Phillips had launched successful young adult ministries in Austin, Kerrville and San Antonio, Texas for the previous 10 years. Under Phillips, Frontline continues to grow in membership, number of small groups, regular events and volunteer opportunities.
Community Campuses.
In spite of a large campus in Vienna, VA, McLean Bible Church realized that a single location might not effectively reach the entire region. Under a new growth strategy, the church began to start “community campuses” for both Frontline and McLean Bible Church. The first of these campuses opened at the Rosslyn Spectrum in Arlington, VA for a Frontline Arlington Monday evening service in January 2007 and in May 2009 launched a campus in Silver Spring. Frontline holds three services weekly between the three campuses. The Sunday evening service at the Tysons Campus averages 2,000 people and the Monday evening service at the Arlington Campus averages 500 people. There is also an internet campus that broadcasts the Frontline Service each Sunday, along with the 9:00 am, 10:45 am and 12:30 pm services.
Ministries.
Frontline is different from the young adult ministries in many other churches in that it has its own distinct ministry teams, small groups and missions trips.

Willie Wilde

William 'Willie' Charles Kingsbury Wilde (26 September 1852 – 13 March 1899) was an Irish journalist and poet of the Victorian era and the older brother of Oscar Wilde.
Background.
Willie was the oldest son born into an Anglo-Irish family, at 21 Westland Row, Dublin, to Sir William Wilde and his wife Jane Francesca Wilde (née Elgee) (her pseudonym being 'Speranza'). Their second son, Oscar, was born in the same house in 1854. Jane Wilde was a successful writer, being a poet for the revolutionary Young Irelanders in 1848 and a lifelong Irish nationalist. Sir William was Ireland's leading Oto-Ophthalmologic (ear and eye) surgeon and was knighted in 1864 for his services to medicine. William also wrote books on archaeology and folklore. He was a renowned philanthropist, and his dispensary for the care of the city's poor, in Lincoln Place at the rear of Trinity College, Dublin, was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital, now located at Adelaide Road.
In June 1855, the family moved to 1 Merrion Square in a fashionable residential area, where Wilde's sister, Isola, was born in 1856. Here, Lady Wilde held a regular Saturday afternoon salon with guests including Sheridan le Fanu, Samuel Lever, George Petrie, Isaac Butt and Samuel Ferguson.
In February 1864, Willie and Oscar were sent to board at the Portora Royal School at Enniskillen in Ulster, where Willie became known for his good-humour and friendliness, later being described by a classmate as "clever, erratic and full of vitality". Oscar became known to his school fellows by the nickname ‘Grey Crow’, which he disliked, while Willie was ‘Blue Blood’. Willie was "an accomplished pianist and an artist of little talent’ Oscar Wilde later recalled that the headmaster, Dr Steele, had told him that “If I went on studying as I had been during the last year I might yet do as well as my brother Willie, and be an honour to the school and everyone connected with it.”
Willie was already a student at Trinity College, Dublin when Oscar joined him in 1871, the two sharing rooms during their second and third years there. In 1876 'Willie' published several of his poems in the College magazine "Kottabos", which he also edited.
Life.
After graduating from Trinity College Willie Wilde studied Law and was called to the Irish Bar but never actually practised Law. On the death of his father in 1876 he and Lady Wilde moved to London in early 1879, where he became a journalist, serving as drama critic for "Punch" and "Vanity Fair", as well as being the leader writer for "The Daily Telegraph" and the editor of Christmas numbers of several magazines. Willie was a regular guest at London's 'Fielding Club', which during its short life opened its doors at eight o’clock in the evening and remained open all night. The club was famous for its grills, its brandy and its Pol Roger ‘74 at any time, though its tripe and onions on Saturdays were an especial draw. One member listed Willie among those who were ‘constant guests’ on Saturdays, along with Henry Irving, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, J. Comyns Carr, Edward Dicey, Carlo Pellegrini, Frederic Clay and Oscar Wilde himself.
Ralph Nevill, the son of Lady Dorothy Nevill, said of Willie Wilde:
"Willie Wilde was a clever journalist who, had he been less careless in his habits, might have achieved considerable success. As it was, a number of the articles which he wrote for the Daily Telegraph were little short of brilliant, while as a talker, few could equal him. He was, however, his own enemy, and could not resist the attractions of the moment or settle down long to regular work – in truth, though not very old in years, he belonged to the now almost extinct school of journalists which, taking ‘sufficient is the day for the evil there of’ as their motto, never gave a thought to the future (or anything else) if they happened to have a few pounds in their pockets."
By the time of Oscar's marriage in 1884 Willie was seriously in debt and drinking heavily. On 4 October 1891, aged 39, Willie married a wealthy widow, Mrs. Frank Leslie, (1836–1914), the owner of the Frank Leslie Publishing Co. in New York. She was initially attracted by Willie's humour and wit; however, he spent much of his time in New York's fashionable Lotos Club drinking, gossiping about London Society and reciting parodies of his brother's poems, which strongly suggests that he was jealous of Oscar's success. The marriage was short-lived, Mrs Leslie starting divorce proceedings within a year of the marriage on the grounds of Willie's drunkenness and adultery. They were finally divorced on 10 June 1893. It was Mrs Leslie who approached Oscar Wilde with the idea that he give a series of lectures in the United States.
On his return to London early in 1892, Willie found that Oscar was the toast of the town for his successful play "Lady Windermere's Fan". It is believed that Willie wrote the hostile review for the play which was published, unsigned, in "Vanity Fair" on 27 February 1892, for which magazine he had previously been a theatre reviewer. "The play", he wrote, was "brilliantly unoriginal," but the dialogue was "uniformly bright, graceful, and flowing." After describing the plot and pointing out some of its banalities, he went on to describe it as "an undeniably clever piece of work; and even though it has its weaknesses, it reflects credit on its author... It is emphatically a play to see." Oscar, recognising the hand of his brother behind the anonymous review, was by then writing "A Woman of No Importance", in which one character says: "After a good dinner, one can forgive anybody, even one's own relations."
Willie Wilde by now being in serious financial difficulties, Oscar began giving him money, but bad feeling between the brothers heightened when Oscar discovered that Willie was constantly pestering their far from well-off mother for money. Oscar once said of Willie ‘He sponges on everyone but himself’. Max Beerbohm saw them as mirror images, and this is how he portrayed them in his caricatures. In a letter to the painter William Rothenstein, Beerbohm wrote, "...did I tell you that I saw a good deal of [Oscar's] brother Willie at Broadstairs? Quel monstre! Dark, oily, suspect yet awfully like Oscar: he has Oscar's coy, carnal smile & fatuous giggle & not a little of Oscar's esprit. But he is awful – a veritable tragedy of family-likeness".
Beerbohm later wrote:
"My sister Constance came home one day and summoned my mother and me; she was quivering to tell us what had happened. She knew in advance it was the sort of thing my mother would adore. Well, Constance had been walking along the street and met Willie Wilde – Oscar’s brother. In one hand, he was carrying a huge leg of mutton by the narrow part; with his free hand he swept off his hat and bent over double in a grand, ceremonial bow. There was something so grotesquely funny in the way he did it, conveying both the mutton and the bow. We decided it was a first class thing."
Willie married Sophie Lily Lees (1859–1922) in January 1894, with whom he had been living. She has been described as "an emotional woman with a tendency to early panic... she believed (incorrectly) that she was pregnant" She tried to induce an abortion by taking a powder. The marriage caused further distress to Lady Wilde when the couple moved in with her. She wrote to Oscar on 4 February 1894, telling him of the marriage: "Miss Lees has but £50 a year and this just dresses her. She can give nothing to the house and Willie is always in a state of utter poverty. So all is left upon me". Willie and Lily had their only child, Dorothy Ierne Wilde, in July 1895.
Lady Wilde wrote Oscar a lengthy letter asking him to be reconciled with Willie, who, she said, was "sickly and extravagant." She was "miserable at the present position of two sons" and "at the general belief that you hate your brother." She then asks Oscar to hold out his hand to Willie, a request she repeats several times in the letter. "Come then & offer him yr. hand in good faith – & begin a new course of action".
Later years.
Following Oscar's arrest and first trial in April 1895, Willie claimed that he gave his brother shelter when he was unable to find rooms in London. Willie said that Oscar "fell down on my threshold like a wounded stag". Standing by his brother, Willie wrote to Bram Stoker, "Bram, my friend, poor Oscar was not as bad as people thought him. He was led astray by his Vanity – & conceit, & he was so 'got at' that he was weak enough to be guilty – of indiscretions and follies – that is all... I believe this thing will help to purify him body & soul".
Willie did not meet Oscar when he was released from prison in 1897. On 13 March 1899 Willie died aged 46 at 9, Cheltenham Terrace in Chelsea from complications related to his alcoholism. After Robert Ross wrote to Oscar in France informing him of Willie's death, Oscar wrote "I suppose it had been expected for some time... Between him and me there had been, as you know, wide chasms for many years. Requiescat in Pace".
His widow married in 1900 with the Dutch born, London based translator Alexander Teixeira de Mattos (1865-1921).

Helen Hay Whitney

Helen Julia Hay Whitney (1876 - September 24, 1944) was an American poet, writer, racehorse owner/breeder, socialite, and philanthropist. She was a member by marriage of the prominent Whitney family of New York.
Biography.
She was the daughter of Clara Louise Stone, and her husband, John Milton Hay, who served as the United States Ambassador to Great Britain and United States Secretary of State. 
Helen Hay was a poet and an author of books for children. A number of her poems were published in "Harper's Magazine". A poem of hers, 'Love of the Rose' was used in Leon Ardin's opera, "Antony and Cleopatra" (Act 2, no. 15). [http://www.jmucci.com/opera/antony.htm "Herbs And Apples (1910)" [http://www.bookdome.com/poems/Herbs-Apples/index.html] is a collection of poems that she published using what she had given for The Metropolitan Magazine, and Collier's Weekly. "Songs and Sonnets," "Gypsy Verses" are also some of her works produced in such a manner. Several of her works have been republished in the 21st century.
In 1902 she married Payne Whitney with whom she had a daughter, Joan, and a son, John. The couple built a home at 972 Fifth Avenue in New York City designed by Stanford White. Helen Hay Whitney lived there until her death in 1944. The government of France acquired the property in 1952 and is part of the French Embassy in the United States.

The Congress of Manastir () was an academic conference held in the city of Manastir (Bitola) from November 14 to November 22, 1908, with the goal of standardizing the Albanian alphabet. November 22 is now a commemorative day in Albania, Kosovo, and Republic of Macedonia, as well as among Albanian dispora known as Alphabet Day (). Prior to the Congress, the Albanian language was represented by a combination of six distinct alphabets, plus a number of sub-variants.
Background.
The congress was held at the house of Fehim Zavalani, which was also the place of the "Union" Association (Albanian language: Bashkimi) and led by Mit'hat Frashëri, chairman of the congress. The introductory speech was made by Fehim Zavalani.
Participants.
The participants in the Congress were prominent figures of the cultural and political life from Albanian-inhabited territories in the Balkans, as well as throughout the Albanian diaspora. There were fifty delegates, representing twenty-three Albanian-inhabited cities, towns, and cultural and patriotic associations. Thirty-two of the participants had voting rights in the congress, and eighteen were observers.
Commission.
At the beginning of the Congress, the delegates elected a commission consisting of eight members, which would organize the debates of the delegates and the other projects of the Congress. Gjergj Fishta was elected chairman of the commission, while Mit'hat Frashëri became its vice-chairman. Luigj Gurakuqi became the secretary of the commission. The other five members of the commission were Bajo Topulli, Ndre Mjeda, Shahin Kolonja, Gjergj Qiriazi and Sotir Peçi. Mit'hat Frashëri was also elected chairman of the congress and Parashqevi Qiriazi chairwoman of the commission of the alphabet, which was responsible for the organization of the various alphabet proposals.
Proceedings.
The delegates decided that the Albanian alphabet and its orthography should be as phonemic as possible. Three distinct alphabets were proposed: the Stamboll alphabet, the Bashkimi () alphabet proposed by the Union Association, and the Agimi () alphabet. After the presentation of the three alphabets, the delegates voted unanimously for the use of the modified Bashkimi alphabet as the standard Albanian alphabet. Both the Bashkimi and the Agimi alphabet were based on the Latin alphabet; the Stamboll alphabet was based on the alphabet used officially in the Ottoman empire and contained mostly Latin characters, supplemented by ten improvised symbols.
Legacy.
The rector of South East European University has described it as "one of the most important dates of Albanian culture." In 2008 festivities were organized in Manastir, Tirana and Pristina to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the congress. In Albania, Kosovo and Albanian-majority areas in Macedonia 
in all schools the first teaching hour was dedicated to honour the Congress and give more information to the students about it.

Tom Gear

Thomas D. "Tom" Gear (born May 2, 1949) is an American politician of the Republican Party. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 2002 until 2010. He represented the 91st district on the Virginia Peninsula, made up of the city of Poquoson plus parts of York County and the city of Hampton. He resigned his seat on December 31, 2010 citing health problems.
Gear is a graduate of Kecoughtan High School in Hampton, Virginia. His father (also named Thomas Gear) was Mayor of Hampton, Virginia from 1980 to 1982. Gear was a commercial printer; the owner of Gear Up Printing. He was on Hampton City Council from 1998 to 2001.
Elections.
2005.
Gear was re-elected in the November 6, 2005 General Election with 11,057 (59.43%) votes, versus 7,419 (39.88%) votes for Independent candidate Randy A. Gilliland, with 128 voters casting write in votes. Voter turnout was 47.69%.
2007.
Gear was re-elected in the November 6, 2007 General Election with 9,156 (93.15%) votes, with 673 voters casting write in votes. Voter turnout was 24.06%.
2009.
Gear was up for re-election in a three way race with Independent Gordon C. Helsel, Jr. the then-current Mayor of the City of Poquoson, Virginia. and Democrat Samuel L. "Sam" Eure, Jr. (a Social Studies Teacher in the York County School Division) of York County, Virginia, As of August 31, 2009 the State Board of Elections website reported that Gear had raised $25,976.00, Helsel had raised $65,261.00, and Eure had raised $5,076.00. Helsel has run on the Republican ticket in the past, but did not secure the Republican nomination for this election.
Republican Gear captured 9,576 votes (48 percent). Independent Helsel finished in second with 6,463 votes (about 33 percent). Democrat Eure finished third in the race with 3,757 votes (19 percent).
Controversies.
Teddy Thompson controversy.
Tom Gear sponsored and fought for legislation giving Teddy P. Thompson $270,000 for spending seven years in prison for a robbery he did not commit. Since the legislation passed, Thompson has committed three misdemeanors, including two assault charges and a breach of peace count, and on August 17, 2009 Thompson faced revocation of a suspended sentence on an older robbery charge, for which he received a suspended sentence.
Hampton judicial appointment controversy.
In the 2007 session, Virginia General Assembly members representing Hampton reached a tentative deal to fill nominations for several Hampton judgeships that have been vacant for six years. Gear's insistence that his sister, Kathy Gear Owens, an attorney and substitute judge, be appointment to Hampton's Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court was one of several issues raised by Gear to hold up the appointment of the judges. Because the tentative deal included the appointment of his sister, Gear's fellow Senate Republicans walked off the floor in protest when the selections came up for a vote. Several democrats also voted against the resolution. During the 2009 General Assembly Session Gear Owens finally removed her name from consideration.

<doc id="20309902" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20309902" title="Placement syntax">
Placement syntax

In the C++ programming language, placement syntax allows programmers to explicitly specify the memory management of individual objects — i.e. their "placement" in memory. Normally, when an object is created dynamically, an allocation function is invoked in such a way that it will both allocate memory for the object, and initialize the object within the newly allocated memory. The placement syntax allows the programmer to supply additional arguments to the allocation function. A common use is to supply a pointer to a suitable region of storage where the object can be initialized, thus separating memory allocation from object construction.
The "placement" versions of the codice_1 and codice_2 operators and functions are known as placement codice_1 and placement codice_2. A codice_1 "expression", placement or otherwise, calls a codice_1 "function", also known as an allocator function, whose name is codice_7. Similarly, a codice_2 "expression" calls a codice_2 "function", also known as a deallocator function, whose name is codice_10.
Any codice_1 expression that uses the placement syntax is a placement codice_1 expression, and any codice_7 or codice_10 function that takes more than the mandatory first parameter ( and , respectively) is a placement new or placement delete function.
History.
In earlier versions of C++ there was no such thing as "placement new"; instead, developers used explicit assignment to "this" within constructors to achieve similar effect. This practice has been deprecated and abolished later, and third edition of "The C++ Programming Language" doesn't mention this technique. Support for "placement new" operator has been added to compilers circa 1995.
Expressions.
The Standard C++ syntax for a non-placement codice_1 expression is
The placement syntax adds an expression list immediately after the codice_1 keyword. This expression list is the placement. It can contain any number of expressions.
There is no placement delete expression.
Functions.
The placement new functions are overloads of the non-placement new functions. The declaration of the non-placement new functions, for non-array and array codice_1 expressions respectively, are:
The Standard C++ library provides two placement overloads each for these functions. Their declarations are:
In all of the overloads, the first parameter to the codice_7 function is of type , which when the function is called will be passed as an argument specifying the amount of memory, in bytes, to allocate. All of the functions must return type , which is a pointer to the storage that the function allocates.
There are also placement delete functions. They are overloaded versions of the non-placement delete functions. The non-placement delete functions are declared as:
The Standard C++ library provides two placement overloads each for these functions. Their declarations are:
In all of the overloads, the first parameter to the codice_10 function is of type , which is the address of the storage to deallocate.
For both the new and the delete functions, the functions are global, are not in any namespace, and do not have static linkage.
Use.
Placement syntax has four main uses: default placement, preventing exceptions, custom allocators, and debugging.
Default placement.
The placement overloads of codice_7 and codice_10 that employ an additional parameter are used for default placement, also known as "pointer placement". Their definitions by the Standard C++ library, which it is not permitted for a C++ program to replace or override, are:
Default placement does not require the inclusion of the Standard C++ library header codice_24 in the source code of a C++ program. However, g++ version 4.0 still requires the use of this header (this might be true of other versions of the compiler or other compilers too.)
There are various uses for default placement.
Bjarne Stroustrup originally observed, in his book "The Design and Evolution of C++", that pointer placement new is necessary for hardware that expects a certain object at a specific hardware address. It is also required for the construction of objects that need to reside in a certain memory area, such as an area that is shared between several processors of a multiprocessor computer.
Other uses, however, include calling a constructor directly, something which the C++ language does not otherwise permit.
The C++ language does allow a program to call a destructor directly, and, since it is not possible to destroy the object using a codice_2 expression, that is how one destroys an object that was constructed via a pointer placement new expression. For example:
Placement new is used when you do not want operator new to allocate memory (you have pre-allocated it and you want to place the object there), but you do want the object to be constructed. Examples of typical situations where this may be required are:
The basic problem is that the constructor is a peculiar function; when it starts off, there is no object, only raw memory. And by the time it finishes, you have a fully initialized object. Therefore i) The constructor cannot be called on an object ii) However, it needs to access (and initialize) non-static members. This makes calling the constructor directly an error. The solution is the placement form of operator new.
This operator is implemented as:
In your case, using this is not required as an int is POD, it has a trivial constructor. If you want to use it, you could use it this way: pointer when an error occurred, is accessible via placement syntax.
Programmers who wish to do this in their programs must include the Standard C++ library header codice_24 in the source code. This header declares the global codice_27 object, which is of type codice_28 (also declared in the header), which is used to call the overloaded new functions that are declared as taking as their second parameter. For example:
Custom allocators.
Placement syntax is also employed for custom allocators. This does not use any of the allocator and deallocator functions from the Standard C++ library header codice_24, but requires that programmers write their own allocation and deallocation functions, overloaded for user-defined types. For example, one could define a memory management class as follows:
And define custom placement allocation and deallocation functions as follows:
The program would employ the placement syntax to allocate objects using different instances of the codice_30 class as follows:
Destroying an object whose storage is allocated in such a fashion requires some care. Because there is no placement delete expression, one cannot use it to invoke the custom deallocator. One must either write a destruction function that invokes the custom deallocator, or call the placement delete function directly, as a function call.
The former would resemble:
which would be invoked from a program as:
The latter would involve simply writing the destructor invocation and delete function call into the program:
A common error is to attempt to use a delete expression to delete the object. This results in the wrong codice_10 function being called. Dewhurst recommends two strategies for avoiding this error. The first is to ensure that any custom allocators rely upon the Standard C++ library's global, non-placement, codice_7, and are thus nothing more than simple wrappers around the C++ library's memory management. The second is to create new and delete functions for individual classes, and customize memory management via class function members rather than by using the placement syntax.
Debugging.
Placement new can also be used as a simple debugging tool, to enable programs to print the filename and line number of the source code where a memory allocation has failed. This does not require the inclusion of the Standard C++ library header codice_24, but does require the inclusion of a header that declares four placement functions and a macro replacement for the codice_1 keyword that is used in new expressions. For example, such a header would contain:
This would be employed in a program as follows:
The custom-written placement new functions would then handle using the supplied file and line number information in the event of an exception. For example:
Placement delete.
As noted above, there is no placement delete expression. It is not possible to call "any" placement codice_10 function using a codice_2 expression.
The placement delete functions are called from placement codice_1 expressions. In particular, they are called if the constructor of the object throws an exception. In such a circumstance, in order to ensure that the program does not incur a memory leak, the placement delete functions are called. A placement new expression first calls the placement codice_7 function, then calls the constructor of the object upon the raw storage returned from the allocator function. If the constructor throws an exception, it is necessary to deallocate that storage before propagating the exception back to the code that executed the placement new expression, and that is the purpose of the placement delete functions.
The placement delete function that is called matches the placement new function that was invoked by the placement new expression. So, for example, if the following code is executed, the placement delete function that is called will be codice_39:
This is why the "pointer placement" delete functions are defined as no-operations by the Standard C++ library. Since the pointer placement new functions do not allocate any storage, there is no storage to be deallocated in the event of the object's constructor throwing an exception.
If no matching placement delete function exists, no deallocation function is called in the event of an exception being thrown by a constructor within a placement codice_1 expression. There are also some (older) C++ implementations that do not support placement delete (which, like the exception-throwing allocator functions, were an addition made to C++ when it was standardized) at all. In both such situations, an exception being thrown by a constructor when allocating using a custom allocator will result in a memory leak. (In the case of the older C++ implementations, a memory leak will also occur with "non-"placement codice_1 expressions.)

Diplom-Jurist

Diplom-Jurist is a master's-level law degree awarded by some German universities.
Background.
Historically, German law students did not receive any academic degree upon completion of their curriculum. Instead, after usually four or five years of study, students would sit their First State Examination (Erstes Staatsexamen) in Law, which was administered by the ministry of justice of the respective state, not the university. More recently, however, some universities have begun to award their students a Diplom-Jurist upon passing the First State Examination, in order to indicate the equivalence of the education to a master's degree in other disciplines. 
Role for the legal profession.
The "Diplom-Jurist" does not give the holder the right to work as, for instance, a fully qualified attorney ("Rechtsanwalt") or a judge. The German legal education system requires examinees of the First State Examination to pass a two-year practical training period ("Referendariat"), at the end of which candidates sit the Second State Examination which, if passed, admits successful participants to the bar. As such, the "Diplom-Jurist" is usually just a step towards qualifying as a lawyer, but not a qualification in its own right.
However, holders of the "Diplom-Jurist" degree may, of course, work as lawyers in unregulated legal professions where admittance to the bar is not required (e.g. in-house counsel).
Other universities have begun to award Magister Juris degrees following the same principles.

First Love (1939 film)

First Love is a 1939 American musical film directed by Henry Koster and starring Deanna Durbin. Based on the fairy tale "Cinderella", the film is about an orphan who is sent to live with her wealthy aunt and uncle after graduating from boarding school. Her life is made difficult by her snobby cousin who arranges that she stay home while the rest of the family attends a major social ball. With the help of her uncle, she makes it to the ball, where she meets and falls in love with her cousin's boyfriend. The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Music.
Plot.
Constance Harding is an unhappy orphan who will soon graduate from Miss Wiggins' school for girls. Her only real relatives are members from the James Clinton family, but they show little interest in the teenager. She is brought to New York by one of their butlers, where she moves in with a bunch of snobs. The upperclass people are not impressed with her, but Connie is able to befriend the servants.
One afternoon, her cousin Barbara Clinton orders Connie to stop Ted Drake from going riding without her. Connie tries the best she can, which results into embarrassing herself. She has secretly fallen in love with him and is full with joy when she learns the Drake family is organizing a ball. The servants raise money to buy her a fashionable dress. However, Barbara spreads a lie and Connie is eventually prohibited from attending the ball.
Connie is heartbroken, until the servants arrange a limousine she can use until midnight. At the ball, everyone is impressed with her singing talents. Ted notices her and tries to charm her. They eventually kiss, when Connie realizes it is midnight. She runs off, but accidentally leaves one of her slippers behind. Ted finds the slipper and tries to locate the owner.
Meanwhile, Barbara has found out Connie was at the ball. Infuriated, she tries to break Connie's confidence and fires all the servants. The next day, Connie is missing as well. She returns to Miss Wiggins' school in the hope of becoming a music teacher. Ted follows her and they reunite in the end.
Reception.
In his review in "The New York Times", Frank S. Nugent wrote that the film "affords the usual pleasant scope for the talents, graces and charming accomplishments of Miss Deanna Durbin." Nugent continued:

Saxothuringian Zone

The Saxothuringian Zone, Saxo-Thuringian zone or Saxothuringicum is in geology a structural or tectonic zone in the Hercynian or Variscan orogen (380-270 million years old) of central and western Europe. Because rocks of Hercynian age are in most places covered by younger strata, the zone is not everywhere visible at the surface. Places where it crops out are the northern Bohemian Massif, the Spessart, the Odenwald, the northern parts of the Black Forest and Vosges and the southern part of the Taunus. West of the Vosges terranes on both sides of the English Channel are also seen as part of the zone, for example the Lizard complex in Cornwall or the Léon Zone of the Armorican Massif (Brittany).
Location.
In central Europe the Saxothuringian Zone is situated between the Rhenohercynian Zone to the northwest and the Moldanubian Zone to the southeast. The Hercynian metamorphism of the former zone is generally lower grade; that of the latter zone higher grade than that of the Saxothuringian Zone. West of the Vosges the zone is displaced to the north by a major strike-slip fault, the Bray Fault.
The Saxothuringian Zone is in some places transsected by Permo-Triassic grabens and intramontane basins filled with Rotliegend sediments and older deposits. The Eger Graben in the northwest of Czechia and the Saar-Nahe Basin in western Germany are examples of such structures.
Geology.
The Saxothuringian Zone consists of early Paleozoic marine sediments that were deposited in the so-called "Saxothuringian Basin". They were slightly metamorphosed during the Hercynian orogeny. The sedimentary sequence is assumed to be continuous from the Ediacaran to the Visean (330 million years ago). These metasediments form a wide zone north of the city of Dresden in Saxony.
Tectonostratigraphically, gneisses (high grade metamorphic rocks) and granites are found under these metasediments. They crop out as the competent massifs of the Erzgebirge and Saxonian Granulite Massif. They were deformed and recrystallized during the Cadomian orogeny (in the Ediacaran, 650-550 million years ago) and intruded by felsic plutons during the Cambrian and Ordovician (540-420 million years ago).
In some places klippes of allochthonous crystalline rocks are found on top of these two units. These klippes are the Münchberg complex, Wildenfels complex and Frankenberg complex. They consisted originally of a sequence of deep-marine (flysch) sediments of Ordovician to Devonian age (480-360 million years old) and early Paleozoic mid-oceanic ridge basalts. The latter have been metamorphosed at a high grade (up to eclogite facies). These allochthonous nappes can probably be correlated with the Teplá terrane in the Moldanubian Zone further south.
The Saxothuringian Zone is often also supposed to include the Mid-German Crystalline High, which then forms the northern part of the zone and lies directly next to the Rhenohercynian Northern Phyllite Zone. The Mid-German Crystalline High crops out in the Odenwald, the Spessart and the northern Vosges. It consists of Proterozoic orthogneisses and early Paleozoic volcanic (amphibolites with MORB-protoliths and tuffs) and sedimentary (pelites, calcareous schists and marbles) rocks that were metamorphosed at high grade during the Hercynian orogeny (up to amphibolite facies). These rocks were intruded by two generations of plutons: Silurian to Early Devonian (440-400 million years old) granitoids and middle Carboniferous (Hercynian, 340-325 million years old) granites.

Professional life.
Born in Portland, Maine, Kellogg was the son of a minister and missionary to local Native Americans. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1840 and Andover Theological Seminary. Kellogg served as a minister of the church in Harpswell, Maine from 1844-54, as chaplain of the Boston Seaman's Friends Society and pastor of the Mariners' Church of Boston from 1855-1865; and ended his life as minister of the church in Topsham, Maine from 1871 until his death in 1901.
Writing.
Kellogg began writing children's books in the 1860s, and was highly productive. While he is best known to students of rhetoric as the author of the once-popular monolog "Spartacus to the Gladiators at Capua" (written for a student competition while he was still an undergraduate at Bowdoin), he later produced several series of books. These include:

Phil Hamilton

Phillip A. Hamilton (born April 9, 1952) is a former American politician. He was a Republican member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1988 until his resignation in 2009, representing the 93rd district on the Virginia Peninsula, made up of parts of James City County and the city of Newport News.
Hamilton was convicted and sentenced by a U.S. district court jury to 9 1/2 years in prison for federal bribery and extortion charges in August 2011 for soliciting employees of Old Dominion University for a paid position in exchange for a legislative budget amendment that included funding for the position. He was ordered to begin serving his sentence in September 2011.
Biography.
Hamilton, a native Virginian, served as a senior member of the Virginia House of Delegates. He represented the 93rd District, which comprises portions of the City of Newport News and James City County. Married with three grown children, Hamilton has lived in the 93rd district since its creation as a single member district in the early 1980s.
Hamilton graduated from Warwick High School in 1970 and the University of Richmond in 1974. After college, Hamilton began teaching for the Newport News Public Schools. While teaching full-time, he earned graduate degrees in Educational Administration from the College of William & Mary. In 1984, Phil became an Assistant Principal with the Newport News Public Schools. He is employed part-time by Newport News Public Schools as Coordinator of Professional Development.
Hamilton emerged as a leader in the Commonwealth’s budget process. He established a reputation of working across party lines with members of both chambers, assuring funding for core government services in a fiscally responsible manner. 
Delegate Hamilton spearheaded the creation of the Virginia Cares Uninsured Program by securing funding to help uninsured Virginians receive healthcare. And, when the Governor’s Budget included cuts to healthcare and to services for individuals with special needs, Hamilton successfully fought to maintain vital funding. In addition, he worked to provide public school educational options for students, to improve school safety, and to increase funding for career and technical education programs, including the passage of legislation that establishes standard and advanced technical diplomas for students.
Hamilton held key roles in the General Assembly. He served as Chairman of the Health, Welfare, and Institutions Committee and was the second-ranking member on the Education Committee. As Vice-Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Hamilton was an important player in the budget process. In addition to having served as Chairman of the Health and Human Resources Subcommittee, Phil served on the Public Education and Public Safety Subcommittees and was one of the very select few legislators who served on the Budget Conference Committee, whose members negotiate the final version of Virginia’s budget.
Over the years, Hamilton earned accolades for the distinguished service he has provided to his constituents and the Commonwealth. Since 2000, Virginia organizations have named Hamilton as “Legislator of the Year” 12 times.
ODU funding scandal, federal convictions and prison sentence.
In August 2009 Virginia newspapers obtained emails which revealed Hamilton expected to be hired by Old Dominion University (ODU) in return for procuring public funding for a new teacher training center. The General Assembly went on to give the center $500,000 a year in state funding, and ODU, in turn, gave Hamilton a $40,000 a year job as an independent contractor. Once the emails were made public Hamilton and ODU immediately severed ties.
On September 17, ODU released an internal audit on the Hamilton hiring. The audit found that Hamilton’s invoices had “no details of services rendered” and that his office was “only lightly used in the beginning and then later not at all.” Regarding ODU, the audit concluded the school suffered from a lack of internal control and failed to follow its own policies and procedures.
Hamilton was sentenced on August 12, 2011 to 9 1/2 years in prison by a U.S. district jury after a conviction in May of one count of federal program bribery and one count of extortion under color of official right for what was found to be criminal solicitation of Old Dominion University employees for the ODU contractor position, a coerced "quid pro quo" for a legislative budget amendment to fund the position and the training center that Hamilton had introduced in the Virginia legislature. The Court ordered him to surrender to authorities by September 19, 2011 and to serve two additional years of supervised release following his 114 month prison term.
Prosecutors said Hamilton is the first elected Virginia legislator to be convicted of selling his position for personal gain.
In May 2013, a man was charged with attempting to defraud Hamilton's ex-wife of more than $20,000 by claiming that he was working on obtaining a presidential pardon for Hamilton.

Jimmy Leaver

James "Jimmy" Leaver (born 26 December 1898, died 1959) was an English professional footballer. He spent six years at Blackpool in the early 1900s, making over 100 Football League appearances for the club. Born in Blackburn, he played as a defender.
Blackpool.
Leaver made his debut for Blackpool on 7 February 1920, in a 1–0 victory at Sheffield Wednesday. He went on to make two further appearances (in the succeeding two matches) in the 1920–21 season.
Leaver made four appearances in 1921–22. He also scored his first goal for the club, in a 3–1 victory over West Ham at Bloomfield Road on 6 May in the final league game of the season.
In 1922–23, Leaver appeared in over half of "the Seasiders"' league games. In his 28 starts, he scored one goal – in a 2–1 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford on 7 April.
Leaver achieved exactly the same stats in 1923–24. This time, however, his goal came in the first game of the league campaign, a 2–2 draw at home to Oldham Athletic on 25 August.
For the 1924–25 term, Leaver made 33 league appearances, his most in a Blackpool shirt. He also helped the club to the fourth round of the FA Cup.
The 1925–26 season was Leaver's final one with Blackpool. He made ten league appearances and scored one goal. His strike came in a busy September, during which Blackpool played eight league games, in a 2–2 draw at home to Port Vale.
Leaver left Blackpool to join Watford, joining Mossley in August 1928 where he was immediately made club captain. He left for Stalybridge Celtic in the 1932 close season and later became their manager. He took over as manager of Mossley in August 1939 remaining in that poast until May 1940 when football was ended due to World War II.

UIC 568

The 13-corded cable with connector of the UIC 568 standard is a standardized connection cable from the International Union of Railways (UIC), used for transmitting a variety of data and commands between a locomotive and passenger carriages. Examples of those commands and data is loudspeaker messages, train destination signs, and control of doors (locked/un-locked, open/close) and others.
History.
The UIC 568-cable and connector was first introduced along with the specifications for carriages built according to the UIC type Y (24.5 meters long, 8 cabins) and the UIC type X (26.4 meters long, 10 cabins), but have later on been used for variety of other passenger carriages, allowing mixing of InterCity (medium to long distances) and regional (short to medium distances) carriages.
Remote operation of locomotive.
Very early in the development of the standard, it was decided that two cords/pins should be reserved for remote operation of the locomotive (when using control cars).
Equipment.
Locomotives equipped according to this standard will usually have two sockets at each end of the locomotive, and carriages will usually also have one or two sockets. Loose cables are then used to establish connection between the locomotive and the carriages, as well as from carriage to carriage.
Train communication network.
Attempts have been made to use this cable for a complete communications bus (Train Communication Network, TCN) but it was decided that backwards compatibility was important, so that un-converted carriages could still be used. This would require an 18-corded cable, which led to the development of the UIC 558-cable and connectors. 13-corded plugs can be connected to a 18-corded socket, and the signals from the 13-corded cable carried through. The remaining five cords/pin is used for the TCN-bus and side-sensitive door control.
Head end power.
Along with the UIC 568-cable and connectors, carriages used for international traffic are required to be equipped with electric heating. The power for this, as well as for lighting, air-conditioning, electric outlets for passengers, etc., is carried by a separate cable. This cable carries single-phase electric power at 1500 volts AC, 50 Hz (with the tracks as the ground connection), supplied from the locomotive, or in some cases a carriage with a generator. In order to use this power, each carriage is equipped with a transformer, which reduces the voltage and supplies a number of electric groups (typically one for heating/air-conditioning, one for lighting, one for outlets to passengers and so on).

Robert A. Cinader

Robert A. Cinader (November 10, 1924 – November 16, 1982) was an American television producer best known for his work on two NBC series packaged by actor/producer Jack Webb's Mark VII Limited, "Adam-12" and "Emergency!". The latter show in particular was widely credited by observers as one of the most important efforts to promote the widespread adoption of paramedic services by fire departments and hospitals in the U.S.
A native New Yorker and an Army veteran, Cinader first wrote for Holiday Magazine and later became head of the United Nations' publications operation. Then he turned to the field of television syndication, working for the William Morris Agency and later for NBC's syndication division, where he created a 1957 adventure series, "The Silent Service," a "Dragnet"-like semi-documentary anthology about Naval submarines. Afterward, he worked for both Hal Roach and Red Skelton in the early 1960s. 
While working a stint at Warner Brothers, Cinader was approached by Webb (a former head of the WB TV operation) to assist him in producing his 1967-70 revival of "Dragnet," for Universal Studios. While on that job, he devised a show for Mark VII that told the story of the police beat from the perspective of two LAPD patrol officers. The result, "Adam-12", ran on NBC from 1968 to 1975; Cinader was also the producer of that program during the early part of its run.
In 1971, while brainstorming for new program ideas, Cinader heard about a trial paramedic program that Los Angeles County was undertaking with funding by the California State Legislature. He became so enthralled with the idea that he persuaded Webb and Universal to make an entire show about the phenomenon. "Emergency!" was set in a fictional fire station, with trained firefighters attending to first aid and primary care of sick and injured victims on the scene, while electronically transmitting medical information to, and receiving instructions from, doctors and/or nurses at the fictional Rampart hospital. The show debuted as a mid-season replacement in early 1972, and despite facing the top-rated "All in the Family" for most of its run on Saturday nights, "Emergency!" managed to gain a large following among young viewers. NBC spun off the show into a Saturday-morning cartoon series for two years in the mid-1970s. The prime-time show itself ran for six seasons as a weekly show and two more as a series of two-hour made-for-TV movies. Cinader eventually became its executive producer; during the 1973-74 season, he also helmed Mark VII's "Chase," a similar adventure-based show. The following year, he would supervise an "Emergency!" spin-off of sorts, "Sierra," a show that lasted only 13 weeks. He produced two 1979 mini-series "The Rebels" and "The Seekers".
Just prior to his death, Cinader produced the first six episodes of "Knight Rider", a new series from Glen A. Larson. The show would go on to phenomenal success after Cinader's death.
Death.
Cinader died from cancer six days after his 58th birthday, a month before Webb also died. Cinader was survived by his wife of 31 years, Jean.
Legacy.
Cinader became so identified with the paramedic movement that he received an appointment to the local Emergency Medical Services Commission. Also, Los Angeles County Fire Department station 127 in Carson, California, shown in "Emergency!" as the fictional Station 51, was named as the Robert A. Cinader Memorial Fire Station in his memory.

Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans

Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans CMG (3 September 1879 – 16 October 1968) was a Welsh-born South African botanist. Sometimes his first name is spelled Iltyd.
Biography.
Pole-Evans was born in Llanmaes near Cardiff, the son of an Anglican clergyman, Daniel Evans and Caroline Jane Pole. He was educated at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, receiving a BSc in 1903 and going on to Cambridge where he studied mycology and plant pathology under Harry Marshall Ward FRS, obtaining an MA in 1905.
Pole-Evans was appointed as mycologist and plant pathologist, and joined Burtt Davy in the newly established Transvaal Department of Agriculture. Although having the most rudimentary laboratory facilities, Pole-Evans implemented a research program and started producing a steady flow of published work. He assumed charge of the Division of Mycology and Plant Pathology in 1912, which later became part of the Division of Botany and Plant Pathology.
After settling in Pretoria, Pole-Evans turned his attention to the rich flora of his adopted country and singled out the "Aloes" for special attention. He amassed a collection of great value and established the plants on the grounds of the Division. Some new "Aloe" species were described by him in the "Trans. Roy. Soc. S. Afr." of 1915 and 1917.
In 1916 an outbreak of citrus canker threatened to bring down the citrus industry in the Transvaal. Pole-Evans orchestrated a drastic program that called for the complete eradication of infected orchards and nurseries. This timely intervention saved the industry.
During his travels throughout southern Africa, he collected photographs and data on the major vegetation types of the region. This resulted in a preliminary account entitled ""The Plant Geography of South Africa"", in which he recognised 19 botanical regions, each with distinctive ecological characteristics. His classification, with its accompanying 1:3,000,000 vegetation map, remained the standard reference work until replaced by Acocks' system in 1953. He initiated the Botanical Survey Advisory Committee which led to the serial publication of the "Botanical Survey Memoirs", first appearing in 1919. He also introduced the "Flowering Plants of South Africa" in 1920 and "Bothalia" in 1921.
One of his longstanding interests was pasture grasses, and he was instrumental in collecting and introducing many of these to South Africa from various places on the sub-continent. These grasses were grown and tested at the Prinshof and Rietondale Experiment Stations.
In 1930 Pole-Evans accompanied John Hutchinson and Jan Smuts on a two-month expedition through Southern and Northern Rhodesia to Nyasaland and Lake Tanganyika. A more ambitious expedition was undertaken by him in 1938 at the invitation of the Kenyan government. In the company of C. J. J. van Rensburg, an agrostologist, and J. Erens, a plant and seed collector, he set off on a four-month odyssey covering some . On this trip they travelled through Southern Rhodesia and Tanganyika to Kenya, going as far north as the border with Sudan and Abyssinia, returning through Uganda, the Ruwenzoris and the Belgian Congo. His account of this expedition was published in "Botanical Survey Memoir" No. 22 of 1948.
During his career, Pole-Evans collected extensively in southern Africa and covered the Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanganyika, Northern Rhodesia, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. His collections can be found at A, B, BOL, BR, E, EA, GRA, K, L, MO, P, PRE, S, SRGH and US. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Pole-Evans when citing a botanical name. His dedication to botany in the service of the Department of Agriculture, set a high standard for a whole generation of South African botanists, inspiring an unparalleled expansion in the country's botanical science. The National Herbarium, which had started with the small collection of Burtt Davy, grew rapidly with the acquisition of the collections of Ernest Edward Galpin, Anna Dieterlen (1859-1945), Henry George Flanagan (1861–1919), Rudolf Marloth, Alice Pegler (1861–1929), William Tyson (1851–1920) and the bryophytes of Thomas Robertson Sim. Pole-Evans was instrumental in extending the ill-fated Dongola Reserve which had been created in the Northern Transvaal in the 1920s, and was scrapped by the new Government of 1948. In 1955 he retired to Umtali in Rhodesia, where he continued his botanical collecting.
Pole-Evans died in Umtali, Rhodesia at the age of 89.
Personal life.
He married Mary R.H. Thompson MSc (London) in 1922, three years after she joined his staff as a mycologist.
Legacy.
Pole-Evans is commemorated by the grass genus "Polevansia" De Winter, and by numerous specific names such as "Aloe pole-evansii", "Dinteranthus pole-evansii", "Gladiolus pole-evansii" etc., as well as Volume 20 of "Flowering Plants of South Africa". "Scadoxus pole-evansii" is named for his son, Reginald.

<doc id="20310362" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20310362" title="Stellar kinematics">
Stellar kinematics

Stellar kinematics is the study of the movement of stars without needing to understand how they acquired their motion. This differs from stellar dynamics, which takes into account gravitational effects. The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy.
In astronomy, it is widely accepted that most stars are born within molecular clouds known as stellar nurseries. The stars formed within such a cloud compose open clusters containing dozens to thousands of members. These clusters dissociate with time. Stars that separate themselves from the cluster's core are designated as members of the cluster's "stellar association". If the remnant later drifts through the galaxy as a coherent assemblage, then it is termed a "moving group".
Space velocity.
The component of stellar motion toward or away from the Sun, known as radial velocity, can be measured from the spectrum shift caused by the Doppler effect. The transverse, or proper motion must be found by taking a series of positional determinations against more distant objects. Once the distance to a star is determined through astrometric means such as parallax, the space velocity can be computed. This is the star's "actual motion" relative to the Sun or the local standard of rest (LSR). The latter is typically taken as a position at the Sun's present location that is following a circular orbit around the galactic center at the mean velocity of those nearby stars with low velocity dispersion. The Sun's motion with respect to the LSR is called the "peculiar solar motion".
The components of space velocity in the Milky Way's Galactic coordinate system are usually designated U, V, and W, given in km/s, with U positive in the direction of the Galactic center, V positive in the direction of galactic rotation, and W positive in the direction of the North Galactic Pole. The peculiar motion of the Sun with respect to the LSR is (U, V, W) = (10.00 ± 0.36, 5.23 ± 0.62, 7.17 ± 0.38) km/s.
The stars in the Milky Way can be subdivided into two general populations, based on their metallicity, or proportion of elements with atomic numbers higher than helium. Among nearby stars, it has been found that population I, higher metallicity stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy. Comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has also led to the identification of stellar associations. These are most likely groups of stars that share a common point of origin in giant molecular clouds.
Within the Milky Way galaxy, there are three primary components of stellar kinematics: the disk, halo and bulge or bar. These kinematic groups are closely related to the stellar populations in the galaxy, forming a strong correlation between the motion and chemical composition, thus indicating different formation mechanisms. The halo may be further sub-divided into an inner and outer halo, with the inner halo having a net prograde rotation with respect to the galaxy and the outer a net retrograde movement.
High-velocity stars.
Depending on the definition, a high-velocity star is a star moving faster than 65 km/s to 100 km/s relative to the average motion of the stars in the Sun's neighbourhood. The velocity is also sometimes defined as supersonic relative to the surrounding interstellar medium. The three types of high-velocity stars are: runaway stars, halo stars and hypervelocity stars.
Runaway stars.
A runaway star is one which is moving through space with an abnormally high velocity relative to the surrounding interstellar medium. The proper motion of a runaway star often points exactly away from a stellar association, whose member it therefore once must have been before it was hurled out.
Two possible mechanisms may give rise to a runaway star:
While both mechanisms are theoretically possible, astronomers generally favour the supernova hypothesis as more likely in practice.
One example of a related set of runaway stars is the case of AE Aurigae, 53 Arietis and Mu Columbae, all of which are moving away from each other at velocities of over 100 km/s (for comparison, the Sun moves through the galaxy at about 20 km/s faster than the local average). Tracing their motions back, their paths intersect near to the Orion Nebula about 2 million years ago. Barnard's Loop is believed to be the remnant of the supernova that launched the other stars.
Another example is the X-ray object Vela X-1, where photodigital techniques reveal the presence of a typical supersonic bow shock hyperbola.
Halo stars.
High-velocity stars are very old stars that do not share the motion of the Sun or most other stars in the solar neighbourhood which are in similar circular orbits around the centre of the Galaxy. Rather, they travel in elliptical orbits, which often take them well outside the plane of the Galaxy. Although their orbital velocities in the Galaxy may be no faster than the Sun’s, their different paths result in the high relative velocities.
Typical examples are the halo stars passing through the disk of the galaxy at steep angles. One of the nearest 45 stars, called Kapteyn's star, is an example of the high-velocity stars that lie near the Sun. Its observed radial velocity is −245 km/s, and the components of its space velocity are "U" = 19 km/s, "V" = -288 km/s, and "W" = -52 km/s.
Hypervelocity stars.
Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars with velocities that are substantially different from that expected for a star belonging to the normal distribution of stars in the galaxy. Such stars may have velocities so great that they exceed the escape velocity of the galaxy. Ordinary stars in the galaxy have velocities on the order of 100 km/s, while hypervelocity stars (especially those near the center of the galaxy, which is where most are thought to be produced), have velocities on the order of 1000 km/s.
The existence of HVSs was first predicted by Jack Hills in 1988, and their existence confirmed by Warren Brown, Margaret Geller, Scott Kenyon, and Michael Kurtz in 2005. Currently, 18 unbound HVSs are known, one of which is believed to originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud rather than the Milky Way. Due to uncertainty about the mass distribution of the Galaxy, determining whether a HVS is unbound is difficult; 5 additional known high-velocity stars may be unbound from the galaxy and 16 HVSs are thought to be bound. The nearest currently known HVS (HVS2) is about 19 kpc from the Sun.
It is believed that about 1000 HVSs exist in our galaxy. Considering that there are around 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, this is a minuscule fraction (~0.000001%).
Origin of hypervelocity stars.
HVSs are believed to originate by close encounters of binary stars with the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way. One of the two partners is captured by the black hole, while the other escapes with high velocity. Also, "captured" does not necessarily mean "swallowed", for the companion to the HVS may enter an orbit around the black hole. However, this can only happen if the binary stars are falling nearly directly toward the black hole from extremely far away since otherwise the speed gain wouldn't be high enough to leave at high speed rates. 
Known HVSs are main-sequence stars with masses a few times that of the Sun.
A team at Argentina's Cordoba Observatory believes that our HVSs are a result of a merging with a collision between the Milky Way and an orbiting dwarf galaxy. A dwarf galaxy that had been orbiting the Milky Way passed through the centre of the Milky Way. When the dwarf galaxy made its closest approach to the centre of the Milky Way, it underwent intense gravitational tugs. These tugs boosted the energy of some of its stars so much that they broke free of the dwarf galaxy entirely and were thrown into space.
Some neutron stars are inferred to be traveling with similar speeds. This could be related to HVSs and the HVS ejection mechanism. Neutron stars are the remnants of supernova explosions, and their extreme speeds are very likely the result of an asymmetric supernova explosion or the loss of their near partner during the supernova explosions that forms them. The neutron star RX J0822-4300, which was measured to move at a record speed of over 1500 km/s (0.5% c) in 2007 by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, is thought to have been produced the first way.
Some kind of supernovas are expected to happen if a white dwarf collides with its nearby partner and consumes the outer matter of this partner. The white dwarf and its nearby partner have very high orbital velocities at this time. The huge mass lost of the white dwarf during the supernova causes the nearby partner to leave at its previous huge orbital speed of several hundred kilometers per second as a hypervelocity star. The supernova remnant of the exploding white dwarf leaves because of its own high orbital speed as a new fast traveling neutron star. This seems to be the most likely origin of the most HVSs and fast traveling neutron stars.
Kinematic groups.
A set of stars with similar space motion and ages is known as a kinematic group. These are stars that could share a common origin, such as the evaporation of an open cluster, the remains of a star forming region, or collections of overlapping star formation bursts at differing time periods in adjacent regions. Most stars are born within molecular clouds known as stellar nurseries. The stars formed within such a cloud compose gravitationally bound open clusters containing dozens to thousands of members with similar ages and compositions. These clusters dissociate with time. Groups of young stars that escape a cluster, or are no longer bound to each other, form stellar associations. As these stars age and disperse, their association is no longer readily apparent and they become moving groups of stars.
Astronomers are able to determine if stars are members of a kinematic group because they share the same age, metallicity, and kinematics (radial velocity and proper motion). As the stars in a moving group formed in proximity and at nearly the same time from the same gas cloud, although later disrupted by tidal forces, they
share similar characteristics.
Stellar associations.
A stellar association is a very loose star cluster, whose stars share a common origin, but have become gravitationally unbound and are still moving together through space. Associations are primarily identified by their common movement vectors and ages. Identification by chemical composition is also used to factor in association memberships.
Stellar associations were first discovered by the Armenian astronomer Viktor Ambartsumian in 1947. The conventional name for an association uses the names or abbreviations of the constellation (or constellations) in which they are located; the association type, and, sometimes, a numerical identifier.
Types.
Viktor Ambartsumian first categorized stellar associations into two groups, OB and T, based on the properties of their stars. A third category, R, was later suggested by Sidney van den Bergh for associations that illuminate reflection nebulae. The OB, T, and R associations form a continuum of young stellar groupings. But it is currently uncertain whether they are an evolutionary sequence, or represent some other factor at work. Some groups also display properties of both OB and T associations, so the categorization is not always clear-cut.
OB associations.
Young associations will contain 10–100 massive stars of spectral class O and B, and are known as "OB associations". In addition, these associations also contain hundreds or thousands of low- and intermediate-mass stars. Association members are believed to form within the same small volume inside a giant molecular cloud. Once the surrounding dust and gas is blown away, the remaining stars become unbound and begin to drift apart. It is believed that the majority of all stars in the Milky Way were formed in OB associations. O class stars are short-lived, and will expire as supernovae after roughly a million years. As a result, OB associations are generally only a few million years in age or less. The O-B stars in the association will have burned all their fuel within
10 million years. (Compare this to the current age of the Sun at about 5 billion years.)
The Hipparcos satellite provided measurements that located a dozen OB associations within 650 parsecs of the Sun. The nearest OB association is the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, located about 400 light years from the Sun.
OB associations have also been found in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Andromeda Galaxy. These associations can be quite sparse, spanning 1,500 light years in diameter.
T associations.
Young stellar groups can contain a number of infant T Tauri stars that are still in the process of entering the main sequence. These sparse populations of up to a thousand T Tauri stars are known as "T associations". The nearest example is the Taurus-Auriga T association (Tau-Aur T association), located at a distance of 140 parsecs from the Sun. Other examples of T associations include the R Corona Australis T association, the Lupus T association, the Chamaeleon T association and the Velorum T association. T associations are often found in the vicinity of the molecular cloud from which they formed. Some, but not all, include O-B class stars. To summarize the characteristics of Moving groups members: they have the same age and origin, the same chemical composition and they have the same amplitude and direction in their vector of velocity.
R associations.
Associations of stars that illuminate reflection nebulae are called "R associations", a name suggested by Sidney van den Bergh after he discovered that the stars in these nebulae had a non-uniform distribution. These young stellar groupings contain main sequence stars that are not sufficiently massive to disperse the interstellar clouds in which they formed. This allows the properties of the surrounding dark cloud to be examined by astronomers. Because R-associations are more plentiful than OB associations, they can be used to trace out the structure of the galactic spiral arms. An example of an R-association is Monoceros R2, located 830 ± 50 parsecs from the Sun.
Moving groups.
If the remnants of a stellar association drift through the galaxy as a somewhat coherent assemblage, then they are termed a moving group. Moving groups can be old, such as the HR 1614 moving group at 2 billion years, or young, such as the AB Dor Moving Group at only 120 million years.
Moving groups were studied intensely by Olin Eggen in the 1960s A list of the nearest young moving groups has been compiled by López-Santiago "et al." The closest is the Ursa Major Moving Group which includes all of the stars in the Plough/Big Dipper asterism except for α Ursae Majoris and η Ursae Majoris. This is sufficiently close that the Sun lies in its outer fringes, without being part of the group. Hence, while members are concentrated at declinations near 60° N, some outliers are as far away across the sky as Triangulum Australe at 70° S.
Stellar streams.
A stellar stream is an association of stars orbiting a galaxy that was once a globular cluster or dwarf galaxy that has now been torn apart and stretched out along its orbit by tidal forces.
Known kinematic groups.
Some kinematic groups include:

Duke Trophy

History.
The Duke Trophy was made in 1952 and donated to the Australian Amateur Ice Racing Council by Len Duke, the first
Secretary/Treasurer of the AAIRC, with the help of an old school friend Dave Morgan. They started skating at St Moritz Ice Palais in St Kilda in June 1946 and both eventually represented Victoria in interstate competition.
There had been Interstate Racing between NSW and Victoria for many years, initially managed by the Ice Hockey Association as an additional attraction to the Interstate Hockey matches at the time however; there was nothing tangible to record the winning teams in these competitions. The
inscription on the plate of the original part of the trophy reads "The Australian Amateur Ice Racing Council Trophy for Interstate Racing".
By 1951 the AAIRC was formed and had separate associations for Speed Skating in Victoria and New South Wales and even for a short time in Tasmania, which was the venue for the 1952 Australian Championships. Len felt there should be a separate trophy for Interstate Racing; especially after the Victorian team was very successful in Hobart in 1952. The idea of the skater on the top was born after he won the three distances in the 1951 Australian Championships, and brought back to Melbourne three beautiful trophies donated by Graeme Smith's father in the form of a globe of the world on which was mounted a speed skater. One of these original trophies was donated back to the VSSU (which later became VIRA) after Len's death, and has since been made into the Best and Fairest Trophy for the Duke Trophy competition. In 2002, The Spirit of the Duke Trophy Perpetual Trophy was donated by Australian Olympian, Colin Coates and is awarded to a skater has the "spirit" of the Duke Trophy.
After a bike accident in 1952 in which Len damaged discs in his spine and was encased in a plaster cast for several months. Len could not skate and defend his titles that year. For various reasons he finally dropped out of participation in Speed Skating. In either 1956 or 1957 and it was suggested that the trophy become "Duke Trophy" to keep his name in the sport. This was not widely accepted in Melbourne for a few years, but by 1963 when the competition moved away from the Australian Championships to its own time slot of Queen's Birthday weekend, the name settled in as the Duke Trophy.
Format of the competition.
The original format was a competition between 6 senior men and 2 junior men with races ranging
from quarter mile, through half mile to 1 mile. Two skaters per State competed in each race,
except for the 1 mile in which there were three skaters per state. The Juniors skated quarter and
half mile only, then there was also a 2 mile Relay for the seniors. By 1955 a 2 mile race for
Seniors was included. The whole program was held over a half hour period on the last night of
the Australian Championships.
Ladies came later in the early 1960s–initially there were only three –with a special trophy for
the Ladies Relay donated by Teddi Jenkins of Victoria, a previous Victorian and National titleholder.

The Riga Graduate School of Law (RGSL) () in Riga (Latvia) is a law school in the Baltic region offering Bachelor, Masters and Doctoral studies. It was established in 1998 through an international agreement between the Governments of Sweden and Latvia and the Soros Foundation. The Law School is an academically independent institution within the University of Latvia (LU, "Latvijas Universitāte"). Current rector is Prof. George Ulrich.
Master Programmes.
RGSL offers post graduate degree programmes in International and European Law, in Law and Finance and in Legal Linguistics, all taught exclusively in English. The programmes are taught on site by an international faculty of resident and visiting professors, lecturers and practitioners from Europe and the USA.
Riga Graduate School of Law (RGSL) offers legal education at an advanced level. The teaching methodology is research-based and extends beyond the field of law itself, offering access to related fields such as economics, business, and policy. Current degree courses include LL.M in International and European Law, LL.M in Law and Finance, and MA in Legal Linguistics, LL.M in Public International Law and Human Rights, LL.M in Transborder Commercial Law, and MA in European Union Law and Policy.
RGSL is an independent institution within the University of Latvia and teaching is conducted exclusively in English. RGSL boasts an international student body, from the various European Union member and non-member states, the Balkans, CIS states, and the Americas. The international aspect of student life is a core element of RGSL development and diversity.
The resident members of faculty offer teaching in their respective fields of competence. Visiting professors from other universities and organisations conduct much of the teaching. Practitioners from institutions such as the European Court of Justice and the EU Trade Marks and Designs Office appear as guest speakers on courses.
International and European Law.
The LL.M in International and European Law programme in International and European Law integrates Public International Law, International Trade Law, and European Union Law, preparing students for careers in practice or administration at national or European level. The programme comprises both theoretical study and class work, followed by a Master’s thesis. The teaching methodology is interactive and based on a mix of lectures and seminars.
Law and Finance.
The LL.M in Law and Finance is an interdisciplinary programme designed with regional, European and international needs in mind.
Legal Linguistics.
The LL.M in Legal Linguistics programme is designed as an interdisciplinary programme, covering a range of legal and linguistic skills useful for lawyers and language specialists working with legal texts. The interdisciplinary approach allows development of comparative legal and linguistic analysis skills in national, multilingual and international contexts. The programme is directed to the Latvian market and to the EU-related market where law and language inter-relate.
Public International Law and Human Rights.
The LL.M in Public International Law and Human Rights programme is intended for students who are interested in pursuing their professional carriers in international organisations, private law firms, public authorities, or in academia. The programme allows for a combination of courses from three tracks: European Union Law, International Commercial Law, Public International and Human Rights Law.
Transborder Commercial Law.
The LL.M. in Transborder Commercial Law programme is designed to focus on practical aspects of transborder trade within the European Union and on international conditions framing European Union trade. It is designed to meet the needs of lawyers working in the private sector.
European Union Law and Policy.
The LL.M in European Union Law, and Policy programme covers integration, the role of the European Court of Justice, selected aspects under the second and third pillars, as well as policy implementation and negotiation.
Bachelor Programmes.
The two new Bachelor programmes are both taught in English and have a three year duration.
Law and Business.
The LL.B in Law and Business programme covers issues related to International, Comparative and European Law, as well as issues related to Economics, Finance, Marketing and Management. It will cover all the topics of a normal law degree, but will do so from a transnational perspective, and it will provide an understanding of the relations between Law and Business. The purpose is to train candidates aiming for positions in business and international legal practice.
Law and Diplomacy.
The BA in Law and Diplomacy programme will cover issues related to Law, Economics and International Relations. The programme is offered by RGSL in cooperation with the University of Latvia. The purpose is to train candidates aiming for positions within foreign ministries, international organisations and NGOs, as well as for journalistic work in the media sector. The studies may be continued on all RGSL Masters programmes, for example the LL.M in International and European law.
Continuing Legal Education.
Through its programme of continuing legal education (CLE) the School offers education opportunities for practicing lawyers working in both the private and public sector and for their support staff.
Research.
Projects.
The Law School is involved in a number of European research projects, amongst others in the following:
Publications.
The School publishes the RGSL Working Papers, a series documenting studies undertaken by academic staff, students and guest speakers. A number of distinguished legal practitioners and academics have contributed to the series, among them Luzius Wildhaber, former President of the European Court of Human Rights, Jutta Limbach, former President of the German Constitutional Court, and Anita Usacka, Judge of the International Criminal Court.
Library.
The Law School's library hosts one of the top legal collections in Central and Eastern Europe and is open to the public.
History.
RGSL was founded as private law school in 1998 through an international agreement between the Governments of Sweden and Latvia and the Soros Foundation. Until accession of the Baltic States to the EU, studies at RGSL were reserved for lawyers from the Baltics. In 2004, the Law School opened its doors for students from all over the world. In 2005, RGSL was made an autonomous institution within the University of Latvia (LU, "Latvijas Universitāte") according to an agreement between Sweden and Latvia under which all shares held by the two countries (76%) were transferred to the University of Latvia. The Soros Foundation of Latvia has retained its shares (24%).
Campus.
RGSL's premises are situated in Alberta iela, one of Europe's most important streets for Art Nouveau architecture. The premises were donated to the Law School by the Soros Foundation in 1998 and were officially inaugurated by Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and the President of the Republic of Latvia, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, in 2001. The Law School shares its courtyard, main auditorium, cafeteria and library with the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga (SSE Riga). The Law School's address is Strēlnieku iela 4k-2, Rīga, LV-1010.
Alumni.
Most of the alumni are from the Baltics, so far few from Western Europe. During the last years, RGSL has become the preferred graduate law school for an increasing number of lawyers from the Balkans, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia. More than half of the graduates are working in different areas of the private sector with law firms, banks and international companies. The public service sector - ministries, parliaments, government agencies and courts - is another beneficiary and employer of RGSL graduates. Part of those working in the public sector have qualified for administrative posts with the EU Commission, the European Court of Justice and European Parliament as well as for posts in international organisations such as the World Bank and the United Nations Office. A group of alumni from Kosovo is involved in the formation of the new country.

Disability Standard

The Disability Standard is a benchmarking assessment run in the UK by Busines Disability Forum.
Best described as a management tool for employers, the Disability Standard acts as a statistical study providing us with a snapshot of UK businesses performance on disability in line with the Disability Discrimination Act.
All participating organisations receive a rank to demonstrate their commitment to disability confidence. Top scores achieve Platinum followed by Gold, Silver, Bronze and Participants ranks.
History.
The UK benchmark on Disability - later to become the Disability Standard - was first devised and piloted in 2004. Built by the Employers' Forum on Disability on the foundation of the 'Diversity Change Model', designed by Dr. Gillian Shapiro as a method for measuring an organisations performance on diversity strands, the benchmark assessment enabled an organisation to assess their organisations performance on disability in relation to the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).
The original research and development group who took part in this pilot project consisted of:
Abbey, BT, BUPA, Barclays, Centrica, Cable & Wireless, HSBC, Royal Mail, PricewaterhouseCoopers and UnumProvident in the private sector and The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Metropolitan Police Service, Jobcentre Plus, Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions in the public sector.
Following the success of the initial trail the Disability Standard was officially launched in 2005 with help from secretary of state at the time, Alan Johnson, under the title of Employers' Forum Disability Standard 2005 with 80 UK organisations taking part including the House of Commons.
The benchmark survey ran again in 2007 with 116 participants and additions such as an interactive website enabling organisations to browse case studies and submit online. In 2009 - during the recession - 106 organisations participated taking the total number of organisations to have taken part in the Disability Standard since 2005 to over 200.
Results.
The findings from the Disability Standard form the base of the Benchmark Report that is published by the Employers' Forum on Disability after each assessment. Disability Standard Benchmark Reports were published in 2005, 2007, and 2009
Disability Standard 2009.
Over 100 organisations took part in the 2009 Disability Standard. For the first time since the inauguration of the benchmark the report included a top ten list of employers:

Grinold and Kroner Model

The Grinold and Kroner Model is used to calculate expected returns for a stock, stock index or the market as whole. It is a part of a larger framework for making forecasts about market expectations.
The model states that:
Expected Returns= Div1 /P0 + i + g - ΔS + Δ (P/E)
Div1 = dividend in next period (period 1 assuming current t=0)
P0 = current price (price at time 0)
i= expected inflation rate
g= real growth rate in earnings (note that by adding real growth and inflation, this is basically identical to just adding nominal growth)
ΔS= changes in shares outstanding (i.e. increases in shares outstanding decrease expected returns)
Δ(P/E)= changes in P/E ratio (positive relationship between changes in P/e and expected returns).
One offshoot of this discounted cash flow analysis is the Fed Model. Under the Fed model, the earnings yield is compared to the 10-year treasury bonds. If the earnings yield is lower than that of the bonds, the investor would shift their money into the less risky T-bonds.
Grinold, Kroner, and Siegel (2011) estimated the inputs to the Grinold and Kroner model and arrived at a then-current equity risk premium estimate between 3.5% and 4%. The equity risk premium is the difference between the expected total return on a capitalization-weighted stock market index and the yield on a riskless government bond (in this case one with 10 years to maturity).

Richard Searle

Richard Searle is a 1960s-influenced bass guitarist, who was a member of Doctor And The Medics in 1986, when they were reaching number one in the pop charts.
Career.
After Doctor And The Medics.
Searle left Doctor and the Medics in 1990. He appeared in two different line-ups of the Brit-pop band Boys Wonder, both before and after they were dropped by Sire Records in the late 1980s. 
A co-founder of the acid jazz band Corduroy in 1991, giving the band its name, Searle's fast and fluid bass guitar playing style was foremost in the funky punky sound of the new mod outfit. 
Corduroy was a four-piece band based in south east London, formed with twins Ben and Scott Addison, formerly of Boys Wonder. It was built heavily around the style of a local instrumental jazz band, led by guitarist Simon Nelson-Smith, who completed the Corduroy line-up. The band released three albums on Eddie Piller's Acid Jazz Records: "Dad Man Cat", "High Havoc" and "Out of Here". They proved a popular live attraction {(Modspeed(2011)} and gained a healthy following in Japan {(Modspeed(2011)}, making the first of several trips there in 1993. In 1994, they recorded a live album, "Quattro - Live In Japan". 
After leaving Acid Jazz Records they signed to Big Cat Records/V2, releasing two further albums, "The New You!" and the Rob Playford-produced "Clik!". 
"Clik!" failed to chart and Corduroy was dropped by the label in 1999 after which the band split up.
Searle played as a session-man with various bands during the early 2000, including The Freestylers, Soul Hooligan, Chris Difford and Mother Earth. He produced others, including Smashing Time, and recorded with the Australian grunge band The Standing Eight Counts and Lord Large. Lord Large and Dean Parrish's northern soul record, "Left Right and Centre", written by Paul Weller, features Searle's distinctively flamboyant style. He subsequently appeared on stage at The 100 Club with the 1960s mod legends Sharon Tandy and The Fleur De Lys.
Searle published written works in 2010. His first novel, "The Absurdist" is described as "A light-hearted, science-fictional tale about the illusionary nature of reality, lethal cocktails, hairy heroes, unrequited love and wasp hammers. Rude and irreverent, this funny philosophical caper about two young scam-artists caught up in unusual events, features the prettiest of girls, silliest of toys, quantum physics and giant space propellers in an adventure of absurd proportions,"{(Modspeed(2010)}.
A collection of humorous drawings, "Sketchistentialism", which followed in 2011, is described as being 'oddly philosophical and blatantly daft' {(Modspeed(2011)}.
Wet Dog.
In 2005, Searle co-formed the band Wet Dog. Wet Dog is an international group featuring Stephen 'Vom' Ritchie from the renowned German rockers Die Toten Hosen. Ritchie played with Searle in Doctor and the Medics. Wet Dog also includes Anna Donarski, who has played for Damo Suzuki from Can and the German punk rock outfit Fehlfarben.
"Fancy You", the first release by Wet Dog, appeared on an Acid Jazz Records compilation called "Old School New Cool 2" in 2005. 
The band's first album "Perfect Crime" was released through Drumming Monkey Records / Rough Trade in August 2007 in Germany. It has 14 tracks, covering such styles as funk, punk, pop, rock and soul. A single, "Heart", was released from the album.
Wet Dog are members of the mysterious Bohemian Underground Movement (B.U.M.), the umbrella name used by Searle for his various and mischievous pop art projects. The name came from writing BUM in the sand for puerile and mischievous effect.
The first B.U.M. track,"I'm Afraid Of The Man In The Pasty Shop", was recorded entirely over the phone from Cornwall and mixed in the B.U.M. studio weeks later. It appears on the Acid Jazz Record compilation, 'The New Testament Of Folk".
There have been several Bohemian Underground Movement releases, mostly through Acid Jazz Records.

Borek (Rokycany)

Borek is a Municipal District of the town of Rokycany in Rokycany District, Plzeň Region of the Czech republic.
History.
The formerly independent village of Borek is located ca.2 km east of Rokycany's town center. Mentioned for the first time in 1390 („Borek villa ad distr. Rokyczan“). In the 15th century the village was abandoned to be resettled in 17th century as a small cluster of dwellings centered around the iron mill. It grew further in 18th a 19th century covering most of the elevated peninsula of Borecký rybník Lake. During 19th century the built-up area expanded southwards, to the proximity of major Prague-Plzeň road. In 1960 Borek came under the jurisdiction of Rokycany. In 20th century the built-up area of Borek further expanded amalgamating the village with Rokycany.
Landmarks.
The Borecký rybník Lake is the best known landmark of this Municipal District. Area of the Lake is reported to be 15 hectares or 10 hectares.
Demography.
Borek's population saw major growth for most of 19th century. In 2nd half of 20th century it however started to decline significantly. The depopulation slowed recently and as new areas are slated for residential development in Borek the trend is to revert soon.

Sonny Throckmorton

James Fron "Sonny" Throckmorton (born April 2, 1941 in Carlsbad, New Mexico) is an American country music singer and songwriter. Known primarily for his songwriting, Throckmorton has had more than 1,000 of his songs recorded by various country singers. He has also had minor success as a recording artist, having released two major-label albums: "The Last Cheater's Waltz" in 1978 on Mercury Records and "Southern Train" in 1986 on Warner Bros. Records. Throckmorton is a member of the Nashville Songwriters' Hall of Fame, and has been awarded Songwriter of the Year by both Broadcast Music Incorporated and the Nashville Songwriters Association International.
Biography.
Throckmorton was born in Carlsbad, New Mexico, although his family soon moved to Wichita Falls, Texas. He moved to San Francisco, California after graduating from college, and first played rock & roll before switching his focus to country music at record producer Pete Drake's suggestion. By 1964, he played bass guitar for Carl Butler and Pearl, and had been signed to a publishing contract; his first hit as a songwriter was "How Long Has It Been", which was a Top Ten country hit for Bobby Lewis. Throckmorton was later signed to a contract with Sony/Tree Publishing, but was fired after none of his songs became hits.
Throckmorton returned to Texas in 1975. However, other songwriters had continued selling his songs, and he was soon re-hired by Tree Publishing. Over 150 of his songs were recorded in only nine months, including Johnny Duncan's first Number One hit, "Thinking of a Rendezvous". Other artists who had hits with his songs included John Conlee, Dave & Sugar, Merle Haggard, The Oak Ridge Boys, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Throckmorton was also signed to a recording contract with Mercury Records in 1976, although none of the singles from his debut album "The Last Cheater's Waltz" reached Top 40. He was also named Songwriter of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association International in 1978, 1979 and 1980, as well as Songwriter of the Year by Broadcast Music Incorporated in 1980. Between 1976 and 1980, at least one of his songs appeared on the country charts almost every week, and overall, more than a thousand of his songs were recorded by country artists. Throckmorton's streak of songwriting continued into the 1980s and 1990s, with Mel McDaniel, George Strait and Doug Stone recording his material as well.
Throckmorton was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1985. Three years later, he signed to a second recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, releasing the album "Southern Train" but no singles. Throckmorton retired to his ranch in Texas in 1988 to care for his dying father.

<doc id="20310625" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20310625" title="Malaysia–Philippines border">
Malaysia–Philippines border

The Malaysia-Philippines border is a maritime boundary located in the South China, Sulu and Celebes Seas. It separates the Malaysian state of Sabah, which is on the island of Borneo, and the Sulu Islands of the southern Philippines.
The boundary is the result of the division of the Sulu Sultanate through the cession of its territories to colonial powers. The British gained control of the northeast shores of Borneo, which became known as North Borneo and subsequently Sabah, while the rest of the Sulu Islands fell under Spanish control and later United States rule. The Philippines still officially claim Sabah as part of its territory, arguing the validity of the cession by the Sultan of Sulu.
Malaysia and the Philippines are also parties to the multinational claims over the Spratly Islands and both countries have overlapping claims over some islands of the archipelago.
The historical connections of the people living on both sides of the border has resulted in the border being extremely porous, with a lot of illegal immigration from the Philippines occurring. The porous border has also resulted in several incidents of cross-border raids and kidnapping by armed groups from the Philippines on Malaysian towns and resorts on the east coast of Sabah.
The border and disputes.
The Malaysian-Philippine border consists of two segments. The first segment is the portion that has already been delimited through treaty. The second maritime segment has yet to be delimited because it is in the Spratly Islands area in the South China Sea where the two countries have overlapping claims over the continental shelf and islands.
Treaty defined border.
Three treaties defined the territorial extent of the Philippine archipelago, of which two are relevant in terms of determining the boundary between Malaysia and the Philippines. The third treaty concerns the cession of some islands in the Sulu Sea but does not include any boundary determination clauses.
The Treaty of Paris of 1898 between Spain and the United States defined the territorial waters of the Philippines. Only one portion of the boundary delimited by this treaty is relevant to the common border between the two countries. The relevant stretch lies between the Philippine island of Palawan and the northern tip of the Malaysian state of Sabah between turning points 7° 40' N 116° 0' E and 7° 40' N 117° 0' E. Although the British were not parties to this treaty, it has never challenged the extent of Philippine territorial waters after occupying North Borneo (Sabah today). Malaysia too has not challenged the boundary and had in fact recognised it via its 1979 map which follows this portion of the boundary as the extent of its territorial waters. 
The second treaty is the Convention regarding the Boundary between the Philippine Archipelago and the State of North Borneo between the United States and the United Kingdom which was signed at Washington, D.C. on January 2, 1930. The treaty subsequently came into force with the Exchange of Notes on July 6, 1932. The United States was the sovereign ruler of the Philippines at that time after acquiring it from Spain under the 1898 treaty between the US and Spain while the UK was the colonial ruler of North Borneo. The modern states of the Philippines and Malaysia became the successor states of the said treaties. Article I of this treaty establishes the turning points for the defined portion of the maritime border between Malaysia and the Philippines. The convention amended portions of the limits defined by the 1898 treaty to the current alignment of the Malaysia–Philippines border in the Sulu Sea, between point 7° 40' N 117° 0' E and 4° 45' N 120° 0' E. 
No common tri-point for Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines in the Celebes Sea was established as this treaty did not involve the Netherlands, being the colonial ruler of what is today Indonesia, as a signatory. The three countries have also not negotiated for a common tri-point after their independence. In fact, Indonesia and Malaysia are currently involved in a dispute resulting from overlapping claims of the continental shelf in the Celebes Sea and negotiations to establish the tripoint seem unlikely for the near future.
Disputed boundary.
Both Malaysia and the Philippines also have overlapping claims over the continental shelf and islands in the Spratly Islands area of the South China Sea. China/Taiwan and Vietnam also claim the entire Spratly Islands area as part of their territory and territorial waters while a small portion of the area of overlapping claim by Malaysia and the Philippines is also claimed by Brunei.
Malaysian claim.
Malaysia bases its claim on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea's rule. In 1979, it published a territorial sea and continental shelf map depicting its claim over the area. 
The Philippines claim results in the boundary claimed by Malaysia above being disputed from midway between Point 53 and Point 54 onwards until Point 66 which is the western starting point of the treaty defined, and thus agreed to, boundary between the two countries.
Philippines claim.
The Philippines' claim in the Spratly Islands area, known as the Kalayaan Islands, is based on discovery and geographical continuity. The territorial waters of the claim was declared by President Ferdinand Marcos in Presidential Decree 1596 on June 11, 1978. The claim was further reinforced in the Philippines Archipelagic Baselines Act (Republic Act No. 9522) signed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on March 11, 2009.

John Quiller Rowett

John Quiller Rowett (1876–1924) was a British businessman and philanthropist. He made a fortune in the wines and spirits industry as Chairman and Managing Director of Rowett, Leakey and Co., and a director of other companies. 
He had a desire to do more than make money and in the years after World War I he was a notable contributor to public and charitable causes. A schoolfriend of Sir Ernest Shackleton at Dulwich College, Rowett was the sole financial backer (to the tune of £70,000) for Shackleton's final Antarctic venture, the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition of 1921–22, during which Shackleton died.
After Shackleton's death, Rowett was instrumental in acquiring the whaleboat "James Caird", in which Shackleton had made his famed 1916 open-boat voyage from Elephant Island to South Georgia, and presenting it to Dulwich College. He was a co-founder of the Rowett Research Institute, an animal nutrition research laboratory now part of the University of Aberdeen, and was also a benefactor to hospital charities. 
On 1 October 1924, believing his business affairs to be on a downturn, Rowett took his own life.
A mountain on Gough Island, a remote volcanic island of the Tristan da Cunha group in the South Atlantic, is named to honour him. After Shackleton's death in South Georgia, the expedition visited Gough Island in the tiny (125-ton) "Quest", with parties going ashore from 28 May 1922 for a few days. When the expedition climbed and named Mount Rowett (made up of four peaks) it was thought to be the highest point on the island, at 836 metres. However over thirty years later Edinburgh Peak at 910 metres was found to be the highest point by the Gough Island Scientific Survey.

Jennings Lang

Jennings Lang (May 28, 1915, New York City, New York - May 29, 1996, Palm Desert, California) was an American film producer, as well as a screenwriter and actor.
Biography.
Lang, originally a lawyer from New York City, came to Hollywood in 1938 and set up an office as a talent agent. In 1940 he joined the Jaffe agency and within a few years became the company's president, and came to be known as one of Hollywood's leading agents. In 1950 he joined the MCA talent agency and two years later became vice president of MCA TV Limited; in this capacity, he worked with Universal Studios and was involved in developing, creating, and selling new series in the 1950s and '60s, such as "Wagon Train", "The Bob Cummings Show", and "McHale's Navy". Also, Lang played a key role in making television movies a staple of TV programming.
In 1951, Lang was shot in the left inner thigh and groin by film producer Walter Wanger, who believed Lang was having an affair with his wife, actress Joan Bennett. The following is extracted from the book "On Sunset Boulevard" (1998, p.431) by Ed Sikov.
Lang survived, and Wanger, pleading insanity, served four months in prison.
Lang produced and executive-produced movies from 1969 to 1986; in the mid-1970s, Lang produced a series of major epics, including "Airport 1975" and "Earthquake"; the latter picture utilized Sensurround to augment the onscreen action with sound waves that sent tremors throughout the theater.
A stroke in 1983 forced Lang's retirement. He died of pneumonia in 1996 in Palm Desert, California and was buried at the Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City. Lang was married to Monica Lewis from 1956 until his death. He was the father of film director Rocky Lang, Robert Lang and pianist Mike Lang.

Humboldt Harbor Light

The Humboldt Harbor Light was an early lighthouse marking the entrance to Humboldt Bay. Plagued by fog, earthquakes, and flooding, it was eventually abandoned and left to deteriorate in favor of a new light at Table Bluff.
History.
Humboldt Bay is reached through a narrow gap between two long sand spits, and the founding of Eureka, California in 1850 on the shores of the bay led to the provision of a lighthouse for the bay in the first set of eight west coast lights. The design was essentially that of the original Point Loma Light: a central tower with a 1½ story house erected around it. A fourth order Fresnel lens was provided and the light was first exhibited in December 1856. The protracted construction made this the last of the original eight lights to be completed, and in fact some lights in the next set were lit first.
The light was situated in a sandy area towards the tip of the northern spit; the intent was for the light to serve both as a marker for the entrance and as a warning for the spit. It was quickly found that the low-lying site was vulnerable to the waves, and by 1867 the Lighthouse Board was already making plans to move the light to a new site on the south side of the entrance. In the meantime a log breakwater was placed around the light. Fog was a major problem, and a steam fog whistle was installed in 1874.
The move was delayed for some decades, and in interim the light suffered various injuries from the elements. It was damaged by earthquakes in 1877 and 1882, leading to substantial bracing and reinforcement. High water in 1885 caused such severe damage that the house was deemed unfit for occupancy, and a temporary shelter was built to house the keeper until a replacement light could be built.
The appropriation for the Table Bluff Light finally came through in 1891, and in October of the following year the lens of the Humboldt Harbor Light was moved to the new lighthouse. The lighhouse was officially closed on 31 October 1892 and the buildings were used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a field office during improvements to the harbor mouth, then was left to decay, with the central tower eventually collapsing around 1933. All that is left at the site today are foundation walls (which can be viewed in Samoa Dunes Recreation Area at the end of the north spit), though the cupola of the lantern was eventually recovered from the sand and is displayed at the Humboldt Bay Maritime Museum.

PRR A1

The Pennsylvania Railroad's class A1 was a class of 0-4-0 type steam locomotives.
History.
The Pennsylvania Railroad's class A1 was a class of 0-4-0 switcher type steam locomotive. When the A1 was introduced into service, 0-4-0s were being used by other railroads. In time the 0-6-0 came and other railroads neglected the 0-4-0. But, on the Pennsylvania Railroad, this wasn't happening. This is because, the PRR had a bunch of tight trackage and street trackage as well. The Pennsylvania Railroad elected to use a small locomotive to operate these tight and confined tracks. By the 1920s the Pennsylvania Railroad class A1 was greatly replaced by the even larger class A5s, the largest 0-4-0s on the Pennsylvania Railroad's roster of 0-4-0s in service at the time. By the 1950s as the diesel switchers became available for easier and more efficient switching duties, the Pennsylvania Railroad started to replace the 0-4-0s and 0-6-0s notably the Pennsylvania Railroad class B6sb switchers with diesel switchers. In 1957, as with all Pennsylvania Railroad steam locomotives still in service, they were completely replaced by the diesel locomotive.

Quincy Method

The Quincy Method, also known as the Quincy Plan, or the Quincy system of learning, was a child-centred, progressive approach to education developed by Francis W. Parker, then superintendent of schools in Quincy, Massachusetts in 1875. 
Parker, a pioneer of the progressive school movement, rejected the traditional rigid school routine, exemplified by rote learning and the spelling-book method, and even stated that the spelling book should be burned, although he did favour oral spelling. Emphasis was instead placed on social skills and self-expression through cultural activities and physical training, as well as teacher-prepared materials, experience-based learning and children’s own writing. 
A survey by the Massachusetts State Board of Education published four years later showed that Quincy students excelled at reading, writing, and spelling, and ranked fourth in their county in math.
When in 1883 Parker became principal of the Cook County Normal School in Chicago, he developed the Method further, introducing teacher training based on modern educational methods.

Colmek Systems Engineering

Colmek Systems Engineering is an engineering company based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Colmek offers its engineering services to research, military and commercial customers worldwide.
History.
Colmek Company was founded in 1977 by Tom Meyer to fulfill a contract of developing a deep sea mining experiment. The contract was offered by International Nickel, a Canadian company, to harvest manganese nodules off the coast of Hawaii. Companies from Germany, Japan and the United States were also in a consortium with International Nickel to fulfill the project.
There were two phases of the project. The first phase was surveying areas of high concentration of manganese nodules that were mapped out. The second stage was a follow up stage where a drilling vessel from SEDCO was sent out. It was at then that Tom Meyer offered ownership to the company. In 1978 employees Tom Hilton and Brent Miller acquired Meyer’s interest in the company, with the approval of International Nickel.
The collection phase was tested south of Hawaii and was highly successful. When the project ended in 1979, Tom Hilton and Brent Miller headquartered Colmek in Salt Lake City.
1979 – 1984 1st Clients.
As Colmek grew during 1979, some of their notable accomplishments were building a side-scan sonar multiplexer that ran at deep depths for Klein and Associates, a sonar company in New Hampshire. Additionally Colmek introduced deep sea telemetry systems for companies such as: AT&T (Trans Oceanic Cable Inspection) and the United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S).
Colmek engineered telemetry and data systems for remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) for Perry Offshore and Oceaneering International (OII). The systems provided to OII were installed in a vehicle called Orion, which later helped locate pieces of the Challenger space shuttle.
Colmek also provided camera and telemetry systems to organizations such as: Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI).
Location of the Titanic.
When Robert Ballard received funding from the Navy to search for the RMS Titanic, he utilized Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) to support the mission. Woodshole’s critical instrumentation: a camera mux, sonar mux and downstream power to its vessel the Argo (ROV) were supplied by Colmek. Colmek’s employees were present, providing technical support when the Titanic was found on September 1, 1985 at a depth of 12,400 feet.
Ocean Drilling Program and the Chicxulub crater.
In 1986 the Ocean Drilling Program was awarded to Texas A&M University. SEDCO provided a drilling vessel the JOIDES Resolution, while Colmek provided data, video and sonar telemetry for the ocean drilling re-entry tool. The project was started to conduct scientific research on the Earths sediment.
A highlight of the JOIDES Resolution program was the discovery of the Chicxulub crater, which is thought to be the location of the meteor that killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.
After more than 20 years, the JOIDES Resolution is still used today as a primary vessel for scientific drilling.
Location of the Bismarck.
Colmek provided the technical support on the successful mission by Robert Ballard to locate the German battleship Bismarck on June 8, 1989 at a depth of 15,700 ft.
1990 – 2000.
In 1990 Colmek installed telemetry systems for a Japanese government mining system as well as a South Korean government research mission to harvest red coral.
Colmek designed and tested two mine detection systems in 1992. One was for Alliant Tech (previously Honeywell), and the other known as the Q-14 for Northrop Grumman (previously Westinghouse). The Q-14 is now called the Q-24 and continues to be updated and supported by Colmek.
Raytheon.
In 2003, Colmek was contracted to design a replacement for an end of life VME chassis for the Phalanx CIWS (Close-In Weapons Systems) Program for the defense contractor Raytheon. This production of this chassis continues today under a current contract with Raytheon.
Merger.
The New York based company Coda Octopus Group Inc. acquired Colmek Systems Engineering in April 2007.

Lawsuit against Conan Doyle Estate.
In February 2013, Klinger filed a lawsuit against the Conan Doyle Estate, who demanded a hefty license fee for the use of the Sherlock Holmes characters in a collection of stories "In the Company of Sherlock Holmes". The book contains no content from any copyrighted Sherlock Holmes stories, therefore Klinger accused the estate of committing copyfraud. Klinger asked the court of Illinois to confirm the public domain status of Sherlock Holmes in the United States, since only ten of Conan Doyle's sixty stories are still under copyright and the definitive story elements (such as Holmes's bohemian habits, deductive reasoning and many supporting characters) were fully established in the public domain stories, and Klinger states that this is reason enough to allow anybody to use the characters freely in new fiction.
In December 2013 Judge Rubén Castillo ruled that stories published prior to 1923 were in the public domain but that ten stories published after then were still under copyright. The stories in the public domain consist of the four novels and 46 short stories. Judge Castillo rejected a claim by the Doyle estate that some aspects of Holmes in the pre-1923 stories were protected by copyright because they were "continually developed" through the protected ten stories, which won't enter the public domain until 2022. The characters and events in the pre-1923 stories, including Holmes and Watson themselves, are free for use by any author or creator, while elements introduced in the copyrighted stories, such as Watson's rugby background with Blackheath and details of Holmes' retirement, remain protected by copyright law.
Awards.
Klinger's awards for his editorial work include:
1999:
2003:
2005:
2006: "The Novels (of Sherlock Holmes)"
Volume 1 of "The Annotated Sandman" was nominated for a 2012 Bram Stoker Award for Best Nonfiction by the Horror Writers Association.
Biography.
Klinger was born in Chicago, Illinois, on May 2, 1946.

Giant horsetail

Giant horsetails are usually living species of horsetail that grow to very large sizes, more than 1.5 metres (5 ft). 
The following species are commonly known as "giant horsetails":
In addition, any giant member of the Equisetopsida (horsetails and their prehistoric relatives) is liable to be called "giant horsetail" even though they are not true horsetails. Most often, the term "giant horsetail" in this somewhat inaccurate sense refers to Paleozoic Calamitaceae; in the Mesozoic, the term usually refers to the "Equisetites" assemblage.

Kinsley &amp; Darling Druggists

Kinsley & Darling Druggists were wholesale pharmaceutical dealers in New York City in the 1850s. The firm dealt in pure medicines, chemicals, paints, oils, and dyes. They were located at 62 Vesey Street in Manhattan An early morning fire on the morning of May 10, 1855, did more than $70,000 worth of damage to businesses located on Vesey Street, including $15,000 to Kinsley &
Darling. Their upper story and roof were burned and the lower floors were soaked with water.
As successors to Greenleaf & Kinsley the business was significant in mid-19th century New York for the variety of products it sold. Aside from medicinal items, the company supplied country merchants, artizans, grocers, bakers, confectioners, distillers, and restaurateurs.
Business fails.
Kinsley & Darling became insolvent in 1856. According to testimony given at the New York Court of General Sessions, December 11, 1856, Charles Wills of Wills & Conley, had advanced money on notes for Kinsley & Darling six months prior to the druggists' failure. Emil Schoning, a druggist whose business address was 175 Second Street and 700 Eighth Avenue, was requested by Darling to go and buy notes for $100. Schoning testified concerning this at the trial of Wills and Conley for receiving $7,000 of stolen goods.

SEPTA Route 53

SEPTA Route 53 is a former street car line and current bus route, operated by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The line runs between the West Mount Airy and Hunting Park neighborhoods primarily along Wayne Avenue.
Route description.
SEPTA Route 53 starts at Carpenter's Woods in West Mount Airy. The street and the line wind through a restidential area, then straightens out before it cross over the Chestnut Hill West Line, near Tulpehocken (SEPTA station). No direct connection to the station exists, and the same goes for SEPTA Bus Route 65. From there the street runs in fairly close proximinty to the Chestnut Hill Line, until it moves to the south, past Chelten Avenue, while Wayne and Route 53 maintain the same course.
The scenery becomes less residential as it gets closer to Wayne Junction, where the line turns south on Clarissa Street which goes under the Roosevelt Expressway, and runs along the east side of a massive railroad yard then intersects with West Hunting Park Avenue. The line moves to West Hunting Park for one block, then moves to 17th Street until it intersects with Erie Avenue, which carries SEPTA Route 56, another former street car converted into a bus route. West-to-northbound buses use Pulaski Road between Erie Avenue and 17th Street, as did the trolleys. Both routes connected to Erie Station on the Broad Street Subway Line, as well as Germantwon Avenue, which carries SEPTA Route 23. While SEPTA Route 56 continues northeast to the Torresdale-Cottman Loop in Tacony, Route 53 takes a left turn on 10th Street, and heads north towards the former Luzerne Depot, which became an all bus garage, and is now a cardboard recycling plant.
Route 53 was "temporarily" converted to buses in June 1981 because of a bridge reconstruction project. The conversion was made permanent May 16, 1985, and it was actually extended north of the former Luzerne Depot to Hunting Park (BSL station). Today, the northbound route passes Luzerne Street and makes a left turn at Lycoming Street, where it shortly encounters the southbound segment of the route on Old York Road, only to turn left at East Hunting Park Avenue, where it reaches Broad Street near the Hunting Park BSL station again. The line heads northeast along Roosevelt Boulevard, then turns on Bristol Street, only to head south on Old York Road again, until it reaches Luzerne Street, and makes another left on its way to the intersection with 10th Street. 
As of 2008, all buses along this route are ADA-compliant, and contain bicycle racks. While plans are currently under way to restore the SEPTA Route 56 line as light-rail service between 2011 and 2018, no such proposal exists for SEPTA Route 53.

Scotch Whisky Act 1988

The Scotch Whisky Act 1988 (citation 1988 c.22) is an Act to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, passed during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II on 28 June 1988, with the long title "An Act to make provision as to the definition of Scotch whisky and as to the production and sale of whisky; and for connected purposes.". It has since been superseded by the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 which came into effect on 23 November 2009.
The act first set out a definition for Scotch whisky - "whisky (distilled and matured in Scotland) as conforms to a definition of Scotch whisky contained in an order made under this subsection by the Ministers".
It also makes it illegal to sell whisky as "Scotch whisky" if it does not conform to the definitions laid out in the Act, or sell whisky with an alcoholic strength of more than 94.8%.
The Act only applies to England, Scotland and Wales, and remains largely unamended in English law.

Oskar Ritter

Oskar Ritter (born 1913) was a German physicist. During World War II, he worked on the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranium Club.
Education.
Ritter studied at the "Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg" and the "Universität Leipzig". In 1943, he received his doctorate in physics under Robert Döpel at Leipzig.
Career.
Ritter worked on the German nuclear energy project, also known as the "Uranverein".
In the latter years of World War II, Berlin scientific organizations moved equipment and personnel out of the city to escape effects of Allied air raids. The "Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik" (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, today, the "Max-Planck Institut für Physik") had partly evacuated to Hechingen and Haigerloch in southern Germany. The "Uranmaschine" (nuclear reactor) B 8 (B-VIII) was constructed in Haigerloch. The construction of the reactor utilized 1.5 tons of heavy water, 1.5 tons of uranium, and 10 tons of graphite. The configuration was uranium in the form of cubes (40 chains of 9 cubes each and 38 chains of 8 cubes each) in heavy water surrounded by graphite. The report on the B 8 experiment was written by Fritz Bopp, Erich Fischer, Werner Heisenberg, and Karl Wirtz from the KWIP and Walther Bothe, Peter Herbert Jensen, and Oskar Ritter from the "Institut für Physik" (Institute for Physics) of the "Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für medizinische Forschung" (KWImF, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research), in Heidelberg.
Internal reports.
The following report was published in "Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte" ("Research Reports in Nuclear Physics"), an internal publication of the German "Uranverein". The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.

Blackoutsabbath

Blackoutsabbath is a concept created by Canadian-American singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, as promoted by the organization Blackout Sabbath. In an attempt to become more environmentally conscious, participants are asked to live "off the grid" as much as possible on a designated date by unplugging appliances, walking or cycling for transportation, turning out lights and decreasing energy usage in any other ways possible. 
As the sun sets on the evening of Blackoutsabbath, participants write down a list of ways they can contribute to the earth's well-being throughout the rest of the year. Annual benefit concerts take place to raise awareness of the cause. The organization's official site contains updates about the program and contains links to various tools, green products and services, studies, and groups that promote energy conservation and environmental protection.
Steps.
Following is a list of "steps" to take in order to participate in Blackoutsabbath (dates are geared towards the first celebration in 2008):
Benefit concerts.
2008.
On February 15, Wainwright announced an intimate concert to benefit Blackoutsabbath would take place at Angel Orensanz Foundation in NYC on March 19, 2008. He asked fans to send refrigerator magnets for distribution as part of his initiative, citing "we've moved on from brooches to refrigerator magnets" (brooches were worn throughout his "Release the Stars" tour). Magnets could be handed to Wainwright directly after concerts or promotional events, or they could be shipped to his management company for collection and later distribution. Special guests performing at the concert included Joan Wasser, Jenni Muldaur and friend and fellow singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson.
2009.
The second annual Blackoutsabbath concert with Wainwright and friends, took place on March 4, 2009 in City Winery in NYC. Scheduled to perform are Teddy Thompson, Jenni Muldaur, Lucy Wainwright Roche, Sloan Wainwright, and Sean Lennon.
Celebrations.
2008.
On June 16, Wainwright posted a message on his site reminding fans to participate on the first annual Blackoutsabbath ritual, which would take place on June 21, 2008 from noon to midnight around the world. Citing that his "message was pretty dry in terms of the comedy section," he attached messages written by his mother, Kate McGarrigle, and boyfriend, Jorn Weisbrodt so that readers could "chuckle a bit". In her message, McGarrigle encouraged readers to ""tune out" all BlackBerrys, computers, cell phones etc.. "turn off" all lights and electrical appliances, host a blackoutsabbath, and "drop in"...preferably outdoors...just like the old celebration of the solstice." While McGarrigle would celebrate the event in Saint-Sauveur, Quebec with "like-minded folks", Weisbrodt revealed in his message that he and Wainwright would be hosting a celebration in Berlin where fans could attend if they RSVP'd appropriately and could find the designated location.
A week following Blackoutsabbath, Wainwright posted messages recapping how he and his friends celebrated the event. He stated the night prior to June 21 involved mostly planning, including food arrangements, how to get his guitar to the apartment ("one of the old Communist towers on Karl Marx Allee"), and how he would be "going down and up five flights of stairs on the hour" to bring guests up to their room. On Blackoutsabbath, Wainwright and Weisbrodt unplugged their appliances at noon and spent the day browsing for magnets at museums, napping and preparing for the party. Once guests arrived, candles were lit and in between trips to greet guests Wainwright and Robert Wilson performed Shakespearean sonnets from a project they were collaborating on. Wainwright admitted he "felt a bit dorky strumming on the guitar and asking everyone to change their lightbulbs, especially since Germany compared to the US is miles ahead in terms of energy conservation." By midnight, guests had completed their refrigerator lists. In his message, Wainwright encouraged fans to continue the Blackoutsabbath tradition by hosting small parties, sharing their stories on the website and inviting friends with knowledge of conservation ("your crazy hippie friend!") to moderate discussion and share their awareness with others.
Charity events.
In November 2008, Blackout Sabbath and Global Inheritance partnered with Focus Features to host a charity auction to raise money for the two organizations. The auction winner won an early screening of Gus Van Sant's film, "Milk", starring Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. The screening took place at a movie theater local to the winner, who was able to invite up to 50 friends to attend the event. The auction began on November 3 and closed on November 11. 100% of the funds raised was split between the organizations.

The Snowflakes Sail Gently Down

"The Snowflakes Sail Gently Down" is a poem by Nigerian writer Gabriel Okara. It contemplates its speaker's feelings on having left Africa and its culture.
The snow flakes sail gently
down from the misty eye of the sky
and fall lightly lightly on the
winter-weary elms. And the branches,
winter-striped and nude, slowly
with the weight of the weightless snow
bow like grief-stricken mourners
as white funeral cloth is slowly
unrolled over deathless earth.
And dead sleep stealthily from the
heater rose and closed my eyes with
the touch of silk cotton of water falling.
Then I dreamed a dream
in my dead sleep. But I dreamed
not of earth dying and elms a vigil
keeping. I dreamed of birds, black
birds flying in my inside, nesting
and hatching on oil palms bearing suns
for fruits and with roots denting the
uprooter's spades. And I dreamed the
uprooters tired and limp, leaning on my roots -
their abandoned roots -
and the oil palms gave them each a sun.
But on their palms
they balanced the blinding orbs
and frowned with schisms on their
brows – for the suns reached not
the brightness of gold!
Then I awoke. I awoke
to the silently falling snow
and bent-backed elms bowing and
swaying to the winter wind like
white-robed Moslems salaaming at evening
prayer, and the earth lying inscrutable
like the face of a god in a shrine.

Order of the Builders of People's Poland

Order of the Builders of People's Poland () was the highest civil decoration of Poland in the times of the People's Republic of Poland.
History.
The order was established by the Sejm on 2 July 1949 for "awarding unique achievements in the task of building People's Poland". It was designed by Michał Bylina and Wojciech Jastrzębski.
Unofficially, it replaced Poland's highest pre-war order, the Order of the White Eagle (the Order of the White Eagle was never officially disestablished, but it was not awarded in People's Poland).
The order was awarded by the president of Poland until the office was abolished in 1952; from then it was awarded by the Polish Council of State. It had only one class. A person decorated with the order had the title of a "Builder of People's Poland" ("Budowniczy Polski Ludowej").
The order was awarded to many leaders of workship, notable party members (including military personnel) and others.
The Order was last awarded in 1985. Up to that time, about 310 individuals were awarded the Order, and 10 institutions (ex. Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy) and territorial units (cities and administrative entities - voivodeships, for instance). During the times of the People's Republic, 7 recipients had their orders revoked. It was officially disestablished 2 years after the People's Republic was replaced by the Third Republic
Eligibility criteria.
The order could be awarded to Polish individuals, enterprises, and institutions that performed exceptional deeds in the fields of:
Description.
The Order has a golden rosette, 53 mm in diameter. The rosette has eight petals enameled with white (inner) and red (outer). Petals are separated by gold rays. In the center is a white-encircled blue medallion, which depicts a gold male figure carrying a hammer and a red banner. The reverse has a red enameled medallion with, in gold, the letters PRL, standing for "Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa" - People's Republic of Poland (orders awarded before the state's name changed in 1952 have the letters RP for "Rzeczpospolita Polska").
The ribbon is 40 mm wide and is red-white-red with blue edges.

<doc id="20311344" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20311344" title="European social model">
European social model

The European social model is a common vision many European states have for a society that combines economic growth with high living standards and good working conditions. Historian Tony Judt has argued that the European social model "binds Europe together" in contrast to the 'American way of life'. 
European states do not all use a single social model, but welfare states in Europe do share several broad characteristics. These generally include a commitment to full employment, social protections for all citizens, social inclusion, and democracy. The Treaty of the European Community set out several social objectives: "promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions ... proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion." Because different European states focus on different aspects of the model, it has been argued that there are four distinct social models in Europe – the Nordic, Anglo-Saxon, Mediterranean and the Continental. 
The general outlines of a European social model emerged during the post-war boom. Tony Judt lists a number of causes: the abandonment of protectionism, the baby boom, cheap energy and a desire to catch up with living standards enjoyed in the United States. The European social model also enjoyed a low degree of external competition as the Soviet bloc, China and India were not yet integrated into the global economy. In recent years, it has become common to question whether the European social model is sustainable in the face of low birthrates, globalisation, Europeanisation and an ageing population.
Welfare state in Europe.
Some of the European welfare states have been described as the most well developed and extensive. It is a common argument saying that there exists a unique "European social model", in contrast with the social model existing in the US. The truth is that the reality is more complex. Economists have agreed on the fact that there exist different social models in the EU. Although each European country has its own singularities, one can distinguish four different welfare or social models in Europe:
Nordic model.
As can be seen in the graph to the right, this model holds the highest level of social insurance. Its main characteristic is its universal provision nature which is based on the principle of "citizenship". Therefore, there exists a more generalised access, with lower conditionability, to the social provisions. 
As regards labour market, these countries are characterised by important expenditures in active labour market policies whose aim is a rapid reinsertion of the unemployed into the labour market. These countries are also characterised by a high share of public employment. Trade unions have a high membership and an important decision-making power which induces a low wage dispersion or more equitable income distribution. 
The Nordic model is also characterised by a high tax wedge.
Continental model.
The Continental model has some similarities with the Nordic model. Nevertheless, it has a higher share of its expenditures devoted to pensions. The model is based on the principle of "security" and a system of subsidies which are not conditioned to employability (for example in the case of France or Belgium, there exist subsidies whose only requirement is being older than 25). 
As regards the labour market, active policies are less important than in the Nordic model and in spite of a low membership rate, trade-unions have important decision-making powers in collective agreements.
Another important aspect of the Continental model are the disability pensions.
Anglo-Saxon model.
This model features a lower level of expenditures than the previous ones. Its main particularity is its social assistance of last resort. Subsidies are directed to a higher extent to the working-age population and to a lower extent to pensions. Access to subsidies is (more) conditioned to employability (for instance, they are conditioned on having worked previously).
Active labour market policies are important. Instead, trade unions have a smaller decision-making power than in the previous models, this is one of the reasons explaining their higher income dispersion and their higher number of low-wage employments.
Mediterranean model.
This model corresponds to southern European countries who developed their welfare state later than the previous ones (during the 1970s and 1980s). It is the model with lowest share of expenditures and is strongly based on pensions and a low level of social assistance. There exists in these countries a higher segmentation of rights and status of persons receiving subsidies which has as one of its consequences a strongly conditioned access to social provisions.
The main characteristic of labour market policies is a rigid employment protection legislation and a frequent resort to early retirement policies as a means to improve employment conditions. Trade unions tend to have an important membership which again is one of the explanations behind a lower income dispersion than in the Anglosaxon model.
Evaluating the different social models.
To evaluate the different social models, we follow the criteria used in Boeri (2002) and Sapir (2005) which consider that a social model should satisfy the following:
Reduction in poverty.
The graph on the left shows the reduction in inequality (as measured by the Gini index) after taking account of taxes and transfers, that is, to which extent does each social model reduce poverty without taking into account the reduction in poverty provoqued by taxes and transfers. The level of social expenditures is an indicator of the capacity of each model to reduce poverty: a bigger share of expenditures is in general associated to a higher reduction in poverty. Nevertheless, another aspect that should be taken into account is the efficiency in this poverty reduction. By this is meant that with a lower share of expenditures a higher reduction in poverty may be obtained.
In this case, the graph on the right shows that the Anglosaxon and Nordic models are more efficient than the Continental or Mediterranean ones. The Continental model appears to be the least efficient. Given its high level of social expenditures, one would expect a higher poverty reduction than that attained by this model. Remark how the Anglosaxon model is found above the average line drawn whereas the Continental is found below that line.
Protection against labour market risks.
Protection against labour market risks is generally assured by two means: 
As can be seen in the graph, there is a clear trade-off between these two types of labour market instruments (remark the clear negative slope between both). Once again different European countries have chosen a different position in their use of these two mechanisms of labour market protection. These differences can be summarised as follows: 
Evalutating the different choices is a hard task. In general there exists consensus among economists on the fact that employment protection generates inefficiencies inside firms. Instead, there is no such consensus as regards the question of whether employment protection generates a higher level of unemployment.
Rewards for labour participation.
Sapir (2005) and Boeri (2002) propose looking at the employment-to-population ratio as the best way to analyse the incentives and rewards for employment in each social model. The Lisbon Strategy initiated in 2001 established that the members of the EU should attain a 70% employment rate by 2010. 
In this case, the graph shows that the countries in the Nordic and Anglosaxon model are the ones with the highest employment rate whereas the Continental and Mediterranean countries have not attained the Lisbon Strategy target.
Conclusion.
Sapir (2005) proposes as a general mean to evaluate the different social models, the following two criteria: 
As can be seen in the graph, according to these two criteria, the best performance is achieved by the Nordic model. The Continental model should improve its efficiency whereas the Anglosaxon model its equity. The Mediterranean model underperforms in both criteria. 
Some economists consider that between the Continental model and the Anglosaxon, the latter should be preferred given its better results in employment, which make it more sustainable in the long term, whereas the equity level depends on the preferences of each country (Sapir, 2005). Other economists argue that the Continental model cannot be considered worse than the Anglosaxon given that it is also the result of the preferences of those countries that support it (Fitoussi et al., 2000; Blanchard, 2004). This last argument can be used to justify any policy.

Hermann Werner Siemens

Hermann Werner Siemens (20 August 1891, Charlottenburg -21 December 1969, Leiden) was a German dermatologist who first described many skin diseases and was one of the inventors of the twin study.
Biography.
Siemens studied at Berlin and Munich universities, receiving his doctorate in 1918. In 1929 he became chair of dermatology at Leiden in the Netherlands.
In a break-through study, he published "Zwillingspathologie" (Twin Pathology) in 1924 which introduced the widely used "classical twin method." He was the first to not only use twins in a study (to determine the role of genes over environment in skin moles), but to distinguish identical from fraternal twins, and use the correct 100%/50% genetic similarity inferences regarding these groups. 
His influence on the invention of the twin study is not widely acknowledged, possibly due his support of the Nazi's eugenic policies. His book "Foundations of Genetics, Racial Hygiene and Population Policy" called for voluntary sterilization of "pathological persons" and later editions of the book included statements in praise of Hitler's ideas on racial hygiene. However, by 1942, he had lost his chair at Leiden and was even temporarily held hostage due to his resistance to the German occupation policies. Not until after the war did he regain his faculty position at Leiden, which he held until retirement.
During the period away from academia Siemens wrote a book about the ancestors of his father in law: "Die Vorfahren von Friedrich von Müller", Munich, C.H. Beck, 1957 - 337 pages.

Triads of Ireland

The title Trecheng Breth Féne "A Triad of Judgments of the Irish", more widely known as "The Triads of Ireland", refers to a miscellaneous collection of about 214 Old Irish triads (and some numerical variants) on a variety of topics, such as nature, geography, law, custom and behaviour. Its compilation is usually dated to the ninth century.
Form.
The following example is Triad 91:
The use of the triad form (arrangement into threes) to encapsulate certain ideas is neither distinctively Irish nor Celtic, but can be widely attested in many societies over the world, in part owing to its usefulness as a mnemonic device. It does appear to be particularly popular in the literatures of Celtic-speaking areas, one notable other example being the later Welsh collection "Trioedd Ynys Prydein" ("Triads of the Isle of Britain"). Beyond the particular form, however, there is nothing to suggest a shared literary tradition. Although triads can be pointed out in both Irish and (again later) Welsh law texts, they are the rule in neither as other numerical forms are usually preferred. Kuno Meyer proposed that the practice was inspired from the Old Testament, which however, offers very few examples. Fergus Kelly concludes that "he case for a special Celtic cult of threeness is unproven, as is the attempt by Meyer and other scholars to establish a biblical origin."
Manuscript sources.
The only edition is still that of Kuno Meyer published in 1906. He based his text on six manuscripts (YBL, BB, Uí Maine, Great Book of Lecan, 23 N 10 and H 1.15) and was aware of another three (23 N 27, Rylands copy and Kilbride). Fergus Kelly reports that four other versions have since been discovered and that the text is therefore in need of a new critical edition.

Baviaanskloof River

The Baviaanskloof River is a river flowing through the Cape Fold Mountains of the Western Cape and eventually Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. The river's origin is in the eastern extremity of the Little Karoo, and follows a valley between these mountains eastwards. It ends at a confluence with the Kouga River, some 80km from its source.
It is flanked by the Baviaanskloof Mountains to the north and the Kouga Mountains to the south, and it receives numerous small tributaries from both. Agricultural settlements along the river include Studtis and Sandvlakte. The valley is situated about 35km north of the Langkloof, which is comparable though larger.
The Kouga River, which rises in the Langkloof has the isolated Baviaanskloof River as its major tributary. The Baviaanskloof river is part of the Fish to Tsitsikama Water Management Area.
"Baviaan", meaning baboon, is a translation of the river's original Khoikhoi name, "i Ncwama", also believed to mean "baboon". Beutler consequently named the river the "Gomee" or "Baviaans". Robert Gordon however named it the Prehns River, in honour of a commander of the Cape garrison.

The album is Velasquez' second from Viva Music Corporation after Drawn. It consists various covers of the past millennium's contemporary hits from the 80's like Jeffrey Osborne's "On The Wings Of Love" to the 90's like Aerosmith's "I Don't Want To Miss A Thing". The album was produced by Velasquez and certified platinum in two weeks after its release with 40,000 units sold. It was certified 12x platinum by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) but was never awarded by VIVA Records. R2K is Velasquez's most successful album both commercially and critically. It is the best selling album by a female artist in Philippine history and stayed in record charts for a year.
Background.
R2K is Velasquez' third all covers album after Tagala Talaga and Retro. She also featured actor Gabby Eigenmann and MTV Pilipinas VJ KC Montero to do a rap adlib for her song "For The Love Of You". It also marked the first time a Philippine artist released an album with VCD. The VCD contains six music videos done by Velasquez with director Louie Ignacio including "One Love" which features actors Antoinette Taus and Dingdong Dantes. It is also the first time in the Philippines that a limited edition 48-page colored magazine was released together with the album.
R2K: The Concert.
After releasing the album, Velasquez launched the R2K Concert, her most notable concert series held at the Araneta Coliseum for two consecutive sold out days on April 7–8, 2000 and produced by Viva Concerts & Events. The concert was personally directed by Velasquez herself and also did conceptualized the whole show. It paraded stunningly exquisite costumes, intricate stage design and pyrotechnics. The two-night sell-out concert caused a big traffic jam along EDSA. The most notable performance of the show is when she sang "On The Wings of Love" while hanging on a harness in mid-air and travelled flying on stage. Her special guests include Janno Gibbs, Ogie Alcasid, Jaya, KC Montero and Gabby Eigenmann. The concert won Best Major Concert Act (Female Category) at the 2001 Aliw Awards.

Giles de Badlesmere, 2nd Baron Badlesmere

Giles de Badlesmere, 2nd Baron Badlesmere (18 October 1314 – 7 June 1338) was an English nobleman, the son and heir of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere by Margaret de Clare of Inchinquin and Youghal.
Family inheritance.
Giles' father had been hanged, drawn and quartered in April 1322 for having participated in the Earl of Lancaster's rebellion against King Edward II of England. Bartholomew had joined the rebels in retaliation for the arrest of his wife, Margaret and their children, all of whom were sent to the Tower of London when Margaret refused to admit Queen consort Isabella to Leeds Castle where Bartholomew held the office of governor. His title and estates were attainted, therefore Giles did not succeed to the barony. The latter was seven years old at the time he was imprisoned and lost his father.
In November 1328, he obtained a reversal of his father's attainder and succeeded by writ as the 2nd Baron Badlesmere. However, when he died less than ten years later in June 1338, the barony of Badlesmere became abeyant as his marriage to Elizabeth Montagu had not produced children.
Records of numerous inquisitions post mortem that were held in the summer of 1338 show that Giles' extensive possessions were to be found in London, Kent and 13 other counties as well as Ireland. Apart from the assets reserved to his widow, Giles' estate went to his four sisters as coheirs. The evidence given at each hearing rested on local knowledge and there were some inconsistencies about the names of the sisters and their precise ages. However, taken as a whole, it is clear from the inquisition records that the names of the sisters were as follows, listed in descending order of age:

Léon Gard

Léon Gard (12 July 1901 - 12 November 1979) was a French painter and art critic.
Biography.
Early years.
Gard was born in Tulle, Limousin. His family moved to Morigny, Normandy, and then to the 13th arrondissement of Paris. Gard at an early age started to express his artistic gifts. In 1913, at the age of twelve he drew a self-portrait in charcoal. Two years later he wrote to Louis Metman, the curator of the Museum of Decorative Arts, who took him under his wing and enrolled him in the Académie Ranson. He found a job as a notarial clerk. At sixteen, he copied old paintings for a play, (the story of an antique dealer and a forger), adapted by Gabriel Signoret whose portrait he later painted. 
Gard was seventeen when he exhibited for the first time in the (Autumn Gallery) with his portrait of Metman. He received a special award and was proposed as a member. This early success was not repeated and Gard later said ironically: "Was my work so bad, or were these gentlemen of the jury carried away by the wine? Who will ever know? In any case, if they made an error on that day, they corrected it afterwards."
1920s and 1930s.
In 1922, he entered the National School of Art in Paris (headed by Ernest Laurent), but he clashed with his professors and the school's atmosphere: As for his masters, he wanted to recognize only the Old Masters and, especially, those Leonardo da Vinci called "the mistress of the masters": nature.
He caught the eye of Albert Besnard . He failed the Rome Grand Prix, but he received the Chenavard prize. 
When he left school "by the Bonaparte route" (that is, by failing), he signed a contract with an art dealer named Chéron who counted among his protéges Chaim Soutine, Tsuguharu Foujita and Kees van Dongen. Louis Metman gave him a small living allowance, which enabled him to go to paint in Toulon, sending back his paintings to Chéron. 
The Great Depression of 1931 stopped these stays and obliged him to take a job in a workshop restoring paintings. He became the owner of the workshop a few years later. He continued to send his work to the Paris Salon and to exhibit in the Bernheim and Charpentier galleries. 
It was through his work restoring paintings that he met Sacha Guitry and they became friends. Gard painted portraits of the actress Jeanne Fusier-Gir, of Sacha Guitry and of Sacha's ex-wife, the actress Lana Marconi. 
1940s and 1950s.
In 1946, Gard founded the art review "Apollo" (not to be confused with the English Apollo magazine), at first writing most of the articles and signing under his own name or a pseudonym. He started a crusade against abstract art and explained his own conception of art, whose only sensible criterion seemed to him to be to imitate nature. 
This work as writer and artt restorer slowed down his painting work and his exhibitions at the Castet gallery, but it did not stop them completely.
When Sacha Guitry died in 1957 he lost a friend, an admirer and a significant supporter.
1960s and 1970s.
In 1960, the French State bought one of his paintings () ("Red Roses"). From that moment on, as soon as he could escape from his restoration workshop, he ran to take refuge in in the forests of L'Isle-Adam, Val-d'Oise, where he painted subjects as easy to conceive as they are hard to make: pond life, tricks of the light, the wind on leaves and sky, the changing seasons, etc. 
Three years before his death, he gave the proceeds from his workshop to his son, and wrote to him: "I had hoped that in the life of art that I had, I would meet some true art lover: I gave up this idea because I found only speculators or people who wanted vane family portraits. I concluded that your artistic sense is better than that of all these fake collectors." 
In his workshop on Rue Bourdonnais, where customers became increasingly rare, he continued to write all that he still had to say on art and life. 
He painted only two more paintings, the last one (), "The Red Géranium" a month before he died, on 12 November 1979, alone and destitute in his studio in the Quai des Grands-Augustins, where his final illness set in.
Paintings.
Early career.
Gard's relatively discreet originality passed almost unnoticed in the thrusting times for art that he lived in. He remained distant from 20th century movements laying claim as the heirs of the impressionists, be it Paul Cézanne or Vincent van Gogh, and his art was deep and authentically attached to the French painters of the 19th century who had been able to get through the midst of official red tape and reconcile pictorial art with truth, freshness, and nature. In enlisting the great historical or mythological works, Gard goaded the Impressionists: "the folly to think something can be achieved without thought, just by representing light and colour".
1920s and 1930s.
Until 1926, when Fauvism, Cubism and Abstract styles came to the fore, Gard stayed away from theory and, it seems, followed Corot's lessons when he installed his easel on street corners in Morigny or Étampes and practiced with a palette of soft and refined tones. 
From 1927, putting to use his stays in Toulon studying light and the harmonies of tone, he expressed himself in still life pictures of vigorous forms basked in a vibrant and colourful atmosphere, or in nudes with glowing flesh. He used knife-and-plaster for a vigorous and open touch, sometimes broad, sometimes tight, working with harmonies sometimes harsh, sometimes delicate. This painting style, which seen up close shows a rash and almost confused aspect, offers at a distance an extraordinary force and luminosity. Gard uses pure colour with a dexterity which belongs only to the great colourists, without ever going overboard. He ponders and solves one of the most complex problems of painting: shadows. He said: "For the part of a picture in shadow not to cause the death of a painting, by creating an inert zone, it must be luminous. A shadow must give the impression that it can move and not seem to be fixed to a spot: a shadow must express as much life as light." 
Starting then, a very particular phenomenon of colour appears in his paintings: Aura. Strangely for a time when one saw so many extavagances, the colourful aura in which Gard bathed the subjects of his paintings received skepticism from the critics, who reproached him for what they thought was a pure fantasy; in particular the paintings with sharp contrasts (such as flowers). But it didn't matter: Gard, with his eye ready to seize the narrowest shafts of colour, really saw these auras — and this is the role of the great painter, to pay attention to a phenomenon that a less sensitive eye does not always see. 
From 1932 Gard was definitively established in Paris, and although he had never seen Mediterranean light, he continued to explore this field in his still lives, his paintings of flowers and his portraits.
1940s to 1960s.
The 1940s, when Gard met Sacha Guitry, are marked by several portraits of the famous: Sacha Guitry, Lucien Daudet, Count Doria, Baroness Hottinguer, Georges Renand, and many others.
In the 1950s Gard painted a series of still lives and flowers where he tried to fuse together two of his preoccupations in the same work, which, technically, are not easy to reconcile and from which he turns sometimes to one, sometimes to the other, the two tendencies fighting, one yielding to the other in turn: the love of a precise contour, the solidness of things, detail; and then the love of fireworks, of explosions of colour.
In the 1960s, he returned to the daily grind, no doubt more out of necessity than by choice. His friend Sudreau, the Secretary of State, gave him a room in the castle of "Bonhommes" in l'Isle-Adam forest. The castle grounds, with its diverse trees, its ponds and its changing aspects tracking the changing of the seasons, offered to Gard a multitude of subjects. Since he could only make short trips there for a day or two, he chose to make drafts. He tried to seize the effects of light, wind, fog, snow, rain, playing in the trees, the meadows, the water or the sky. The light is expressed in prominent fluid brushstrokes, which do not seek to flatter the layman's eye. For the expert, these landscapes are a collection of erudite and delicious harmonies which sing nature.
1970s.
At the start of the 1970s, he returned to a series of still lives where he expresses the science of reflections in glass, as well as his science which consists in making one can feel how objects differ. He painted his last portraits. In the ("Young Man With Coat"), he pays homage to Titian, reaffirming, in the midst of the non-figurative art movement, his ties with the Enlightenement and Impressionist painters.
Writing.
1930s and 1940s.
Gard took notes and wrote comments on art since he was seventeen years old. He gave conferences in Paris in the 1930s. He confessed this was not his gift, so he soon gave it up and started the practice of introducing his exhibition catalogue with a lecture on painting, often a satire against certain movements, the "Salons" or the art critics. 
In 1943 and 1944, he wrote five articles for the weekly magazine "Panorama": "On Still-Life", "Forms and the plurality of exactness in painting", "Gauguin's Heritage", "Backbones won't swallow", "'Gérôme', or 'the blunder of an era'".
In 1946 he founded the bi-monthly "Apollo", in which he published more than two hundred articles over ten years including "The 'Avanced' advance into the void", "We must discourage fine art", "The imitation of nature is the only desire in the plastic arts", "The 'golden number' is in nature", "Art has deserted France", "Rules on the harmony of colours and volumes", "The love of art is a bastion against the robot", "We must support art education", "Rules are necessary", "Against publicity", "Speculations on the fine arts", "Nature or nothing", "Refutation of Cubism", "The commercial genius", and so on. He set forth his position toward non-figurative art, explored its origins (which he considered fallacious), and highlighted the lack of understandable criteria by which to judge which works are valuable which are not. 
1970s.
He continued to write on similar topics for "L'Amateur d'Art" ("The art lover") <-- I'm assuming this is a magazine --> and in the 1970s for the journal "Rivarol".

Texas Fair Trade Coalition

The Texas Fair Trade Coalition (TFTC) is a coalition of labor unions, environmental advocacy organizations, consumer groups, family farm advocacy organizations, faith organizations, professors and students that promotes democratic control over fiscal and social policies, social justice, workers' rights and livable wages, and sustainable development in Texas and worldwide through improvements to trade policy. 
TFTC was instrumental in getting specific information on the presidential candidates' trade policy positions during the 2008 election through questionnaires. Now President Barack Obama commented to the Texas Fair Trade Coalition as reported in Reuters, that he would only support the Panama trade agreement "only if it does not bear the flaws of other NAFTA-style agreements."
The Texas Fair Trade Coalition also works on local issues including advocating for "sweat-free" city ordinances. Marc Jacobson, director of TFTC, said that 50-60 cities have passed ordinances that require city government to buy textiles and laundry services from companies that do not practice the worst forms of “sweat shop” worker abuse. The group is advocating for a similar ordinance in Dallas, Texas.
TFTC also plans a variety of educational events around trade policy.

Konrad Bercovici

Konrad Bercovici (1882–1961) was an American writer.
Life and career.
Born in Romania, into a non-observing Jewish family, in 1882, Konrad Bercovici grew up chiefly in Galaţi. His family was polyglot, teaching their children Greek, Romanian, French and German, and they mixed freely with Greeks, Romanians, Russians, Turks, Jews, and Roma that moved throughout Dobrudja and the Danubian Delta region. According to his autobiography, Bercovici especially developed a close connection with local Roma through contact with his Roma nursemaid, her family, and the Roma with whom his father traded horses. The family remained in Romania until his father died from injuries sustained during anti-Semitic riots in Galaţi when Bercovici was 11.
After his father's death, most of the family emigrated to Paris. Konrad worked there during preparations for the 1900 World's Fair, and his education was influenced by witnessing public debates and recriminations surrounding the Dreyfus Affair. Bercovici went to the Université Populaire where he studied to be an organist. In Paris, he met his wife, the sculptor Naomi Librescu. Together, they emigrated to North America. After some time in Montréal, Canada, the family settled on the Lower East Side, Manhattan, New York City. To make ends meet Bercovici worked in sweatshops, gave piano lessons, and played the organ for nickelodeons. He had begun his work as a writer as a journalist for a Yiddish paper in Montreal, but garnered attention when his first English-language book "Crimes of Charity"—with an introduction by John Reed—exposed controversial practices in private charities in New York City.
Bercovici continued to write articles as a journalist throughout his career, but became best known for his literary fiction that explored Gypsy themes. Stories like "Ghitza," and "The Bear Tamer's Daughter" established Bercovici as a peer of his contemporaries in the 1920s when he was often included in World's Best Short Fiction collections. Once his career as an author took off, Bercovici frequented the Hotel Algonquin. At this time, he and his wife Naomi became close friends with Paul Robeson and his wife Essie.
His success as a writer afforded Bercovici for travels from which he produced well-received examinations of Ethnic immigrants making their homes throughout the United States. In his work "Around the world in New York" he sets a chapter, titled Spain, dedicated to the Spanish corner of the city, called Little Spain. Most often, Bercovici traveled to Europe where he ran in circles with Lost Generation writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.
He went on to write works of biography, travel and fiction. He also wrote articles for Harper's.
Bercovici's stories generated interest in Hollywood where he worked as a screenwriter for several years. There, he befriended Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks.
Naturalist American writer Theodore Dreiser had copies of his work in his library.
Bercovici v. Chaplin.
The Charlie Chaplin hit "The Great Dictator" (1940) was the subject of a plagiarism lawsuit (Bercovici v. Chaplin) in 1947 against Chaplin. The case was settled, with Chaplin paying Konrad Bercovici $95,000. In his autobiography, Chaplin insisted that he had been the sole writer of the movie's script. He came to a settlement, though, because of his "unpopularity in the States at that moment and being under such court pressure, was terrified, not knowing what to expect next."
However, Konrad Bercovici was represented in his plagiarism suit by attorney Louis Nizer. In his book, "My Life in Court," Louis Nizer goes into brief detail about the Bercovici/Chaplin case: "The claim was that Chaplin had approached Bercovici to produce one of his gypsy stories as a motion picture and in the course of those friendly negotiations Bercovici gave him an outline of "The Great Dictator" story about a barber who looks like Hitler and is confused with him. Chaplin denied ever having negotiated for the gypsy story and also denied the rest of the claim...One day, upon my continuous inquiry, Bercovici suddenly had a flash of memory. He recalled that he had met Chaplin in a theater in Hollywood and that Chaplin had pointed out a Russian baritone in the audience whom he thought might play the leading role in the gypsy story. Bercovici believed that they spoke to the singer that evening and that he might possibly be a witness." Louis Nizer tracked down Kushnevitz, the Russian baritone at issue: "He recalled the incident vividly, for this, as he put it, was one of the great moments in his life - the possibility that he would star in a Chaplin picture. Chaplin had called him down the aisle of the theater and had given him his private telephone number. He pulled out a little black book from his back pocket and he still had the number written in it. He was a perfect witness in view of Chaplin's denial of any interest in Bercovici's gypsy story."

Pacific Survivors Center

Pacific Survivor Center (PSC) is a Hawaii-based nonprofit organization dedicated to the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of survivors of torture, human trafficking, and related human rights abuses. The services they provide include health care, outreach, social services, and training. Josh Holloway, the star of ABC's hit show "Lost", has recently worked with PSC and the Hawaii Coalition to produce a public service announcement to help inform the public about the horrors of human trafficking.
Health care.
Survivors of human trafficking and torture have diverse medical issues, many of which have never been previously addressed. They can suffer from medical conditions ranging from hypertension to asthma to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria. They can also suffer physical problems that are a direct result of the trauma they suffered; these can include headaches, musculoskeletal injuries, gastrointestinal complaints, genitourinary problems such as sexually transmitted diseases and physical injury, dental problems, and hearing and visual loss.
In addition to the above, many survivors suffer from somatic manifestations of post-traumatic stress disorder, including diffuse pain, insomnia, nightmares and flashbacks, as well as depression and severe anxiety. Difficulty with language, unfamiliarity with the health care systems, mistrust of authorities and cost are all barriers to survivors accessing adequate and appropriate care for themselves and their loved ones.
Outreach.
Advocacy: PSC is dedicated to efforts to change policy and practices at the local, national, and international levels to facilitate the healing of human trafficking and torture survivors. The center promotes and facilitates dialogue between policy makers and non-government organizations to create a robust anti-trafficking and torture public policy ensuring the protection of survivors' fundamental human rights.
Public awareness: Raising public awareness for the rights of human trafficking and torture survivors is key to the success of anti-trafficking and torture movements. Education initiatives are directed towards the general public and individuals that are particularly vulnerable to these crimes. The center utilizes many different modes of communication, including public service announcements, media campaigns, informational brochures, educational campaigns directed towards schools and universities, and community partnerships.
Prevention: The center collaborates with local and international partners to reduce the risk of trafficking in vulnerable communities. Our prevention efforts include improving educational and economic opportunities, particularly for girls and women, in high-risk regions.
Social services.
The is committed to the self-sufficiency of all survivors of human trafficking and torture. In collaboration with local service providers, PSC assists survivors to access food, clothing, shelter, legal services, interpretation services, transportation and other public benefits as needed. It also maintains an emergency fund for survivors if immediate assistance is required and survivors are not eligible for available public benefits. To promote the mental well-being and independence of survivors, the center also offers referrals to a multitude of services including job training, employment, English as a second language (ESL) classes, educational programs and art therapy.
Training.
Health care providers and other frontline social service providers are crucial to the discovery, rescue and subsequent provision of appropriate care to victims of human trafficking and torture. To this end, PSC trains local, national, and international health care providers, NGOs, and government entities, in order to build capacity in their organizations to recognize and provide for these vulnerable populations.
Recent awards.
September 19, 2008: Major General Antonio Taguba, U.S. Army (Ret.) and Pacific Survivor Center were awarded the "Keeper of the Flame Award" by Na Loio Immigrant Rights & Public Interest Legal Center during their 25th Anniversary celebration.

Allmusic - "Featured on Sick Wid It's "Southwest Riders" compilation barely a year before, A-1's album debut for the label is a bruising piece of midtempo G-funk, stacked with machine-gun percussion and A-1's slick raps.

David Sirlin

David Sirlin is a game designer from California. He balanced the popular video games "Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix" and "Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix". His self-granted nickname is "Low Strong," but he is known primarily by his surname in the gaming community at large.
He has obtained degrees in mathematics and business from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and MIT Sloan School of Management. Early in his career, Sirlin was an assistant game designer at 3D0. Sirlin has been described as a "renowned game theory author" by "Forbes" magazine, and as an "arcade guru" and "internet-renowned "Street Fighter" tournament player" by "Ars Technica".
Writing.
Sirlin maintains a blog where he writes primarily on the subject of game design. A frequent contributor to Gamasutra, he is relatively infamous for his sometimes unpopular opinions towards the way companies choose to enforce rules in their games, as well as for his articles on Playing to Win. Sirlin's website, Sirlin.net, was profiled in Katie Salen's "Rules of Play" (2004), which commended the site for its "surprising amount of thoughtful commentary and analysis".
In addition to this, he has published a book called "Playing to Win: Becoming The Champion", a book that explores the concept of competitive gaming and the mindset of actively playing to win, also drawing examples of the different kinds of gamers that exist by selectively choosing and analyzing both chess and "Street Fighter" players. Physical copies of this book were initially available from Lulu.com before the book was released for free to the general public on his website. The book was cited by scholar David Myers in his paper "Self and selfishness in online social play".
Sirlin has become critical of many mainstream competitive games for what he perceives to be manipulative business practices and other 'anti-competitive' elements. He has particularly condemned collectible card games such as for hiding strategically-critical components within a random distribution system, and popular MOBA game League of Legends for its "forced grinding," calling it "fraudulent" and disrespectful to players. 
Game design.
While employed at Backbone Entertainment, Sirlin was lead designer behind "Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix", a remake of "Super Street Fighter II Turbo". He designed the online card game "Kongai" for Kongregate. He was also in deliberation with Capcom in an attempt to acquire permission to use the "Street Fighter" characters for his current project, "Yomi", but was not granted it, leading the game design to instead use his own personal IP.
During development of "Super Street Fighter II HD Remix", many interviews as well as a number of blog posts on Capcom Unity chronicle Sirlin's involvement in both the game's development as well the major design choices and changes made to the game itself.
In 2009 Sirlin was one of the speakers at the Game Developers Conference, the largest annual gathering of professional video game developers. His 1-hour lecture was about balancing multiplayer competitive games.
More recently Sirlin has been involved in the design and production of his own line of card games. These games all take place in his Fantasy Strike universe. Two of these games (Yomi and Flash Duel) attempt to recreate some of the game concepts found in the fighting games he is familiar with. The third game, Puzzle Strike, attempts to recreate the Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo experience.
Online versions of Yomi and Puzzle Strike are available, as well as Flash Duel, Free-to-play at the Fantasy Strike website.
