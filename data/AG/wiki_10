Anarchy Alive!

__NOTOC__
Anarchy Alive!: Anti-Authoritarian Politics from Practice to Theory is a book by Uri Gordon that investigates anarchist theory and practice. An expanded reworking of the author's PhD thesis at the University of Oxford, the book was released by Pluto Press, a London-based radical publisher, in November 2007. It is presented as "an anarchist book about anarchism", and assumes some background knowledge and sympathy for anarchism on the part of the reader. Gordon considers his approach in the book to have many commonalities with that of anthropologist David Graeber, author of "Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology".
Contents.
"Anarchy Alive!" was not designed to further debates about the finer points of anarchist theory within academia, nor as a history of ideas, but rather to serve as a tool for activists trying to engage with theory—leading reviewer Alex Pritchard to characterise it as "a user’s manual for anarchist activism". It is divided into six chapters, addressing anarchism as a political culture, anarchism as an ideology, anarchist forms of organisation and power, anarchism and violence, anarchism and technology, and anarchism and nationalism (through the case study of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict).
Reception.
"Anarchy Alive!" was favourably reviewed in journals including "", "New International" and "Anarchist Studies". Reviewing the book in "Anarchist Studies", Alex Pritchard predicted that "not only will "Anarchy Alive!" become required reading in the anarchist movement, but it will have a sizeable impact on the academy … this will be a defining text in anarchist circles for the next few years at the very least". Richard Swift, in a review for "New International", called the book "a short and thoughtful account", and granted it a four-out-out-of-four star rating. The CrimethInc. collective recommended the work for its analysis of power and authority in an anarchist context. "Freedom" reviewer Tom Jennings dissented, calling into question the theoretical coherence of the book. Another critical view came from the "Socialist Standard", which although conceding that the book was "well-written and can be read on a know-your-opponent basis", denounced the book for its anarchist critique of democracy.

He is member of the Senate of France, representing the department of Pyrénées-Orientales as well as the president of the Urban Community of Mediterranean Perpignan. An engineer by profession, he was a member of the Union for French Democracy and then the Union for a Popular Movement. His parents, Paul and Jacqueline Alduy, also served as senators of France.
Youth and professional career.
Alduy was born in Lyon. A polytechnic general engineer of National Road Training, he went through a large of his career in the Ivory Coast as the Director of the Central Office of Technical Studies from 1978 to 1980. He was the permanent secretary of building and technical policy of building management to the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing between 1981 and 1986. A year after leaving this post, he briefly became the Techinal Adviser to Pierre Méhaignerie's cabinet between 1987 and 1988) then minister of Equipment, Housing and Transport. He then became Director General of Public Planning in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines from 1988 to 1993. In 1998 he finally became Engineer General of Roads.
Senator and Mayor of Perpignan.
Elected Adviser General of the Pyrénées-Orientales in 1992, he became Mayor of Perpignan without any competition in June 1993 after a partial election, succeeding his father who had occupied the post since 1959. Alduy was re-elected to the municipality in a four-way race in 1993 and subsequently a three-way race in 1995 and 2001.
After his failure in the legislative elections of 1993 and 1997, he was elected as senator of the Pyrénées-Orientales on the 23 September 2001. He then joined the UMP in 2002.
As the Vice President of the Radical Party of France, he gave his support to Nicolas Sarkozy who he welcomed to Perpignan for a meeting on the 23 February 2007 where he severely attacked the approach of François Bayrou.
Municipal elections of 2008.
The 2008 election gave rise to heated debates, the opposition and several associations of Perpignan speaking out against the incumbent mayor's several projects, including construction of a theater by architect Jean Nouvel, and that of a new bridge over the Tet.
In the second round of voting, the list led by Alduy won with 45.5% of the vote, 574 votes ahead of the list of the Socialist Party, led by Jacqueline Amiel-Donat and a list of various left-leaning politicians and that of Jean Codognè Ripoull Clotilde, head of the Democratic Movement. During the counting of the second round, the president of the polling station No. 4 (out of 66) was caught in possession of ballot papers on behalf of John Paul Alduy hidden in his socks.
The exiting mayor was then re-elected by the new municipal council on in a tense climate under the watchful eye of the national media.
The opposition challenged the legality of absentee and proxy votes, and formed a motion for annulment of the vote before the Administrative Court in Montpellier, to consider the procedure of the president of the polling station No. 4. For his part, Jean-Paul Alduy, convinced of the legality of the election, began a civil action.
In October 2008, based solely on incidents of Polling Station No. 4, the Administrative Court decided to invalidate the result. Jean-Paul Alduy appealed this decision to the Council of State. In a decision dated April 23, 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the appeal, confirming the decision of the lower court. The municipal election in Perpignan was officially cancelled and a new election was organized.

One week later, with the turnout increased to 51.08%, the UMP List won with 53.34% of the votes in a three way race. He was re-elected by the new municipal council on by 43 votes to 8, beating his Socialist opponent.
On this occasion, he announced that he would not be seeking a new mandate in the municipal elections of 2014. On the , Jean-Paul Alduy again became the president of the Urban Community of Mediterranean Perpignan with 87.5% of the vote
Resignation.
On the , Jean-Paul Alduy announced his resignation from the office of mayor of Perpignan, in order to become first deputy. Wishing to invest more in the urban community and anticipating the reform of local government, he ceded his seat to his first deputy, Jean-Marc Pujol1.

Communist Party of Poland (Mijal)

The Communist Party of Poland (Mijal, sometimes called Marxist-Leninist) was an illegal anti-revisionist political party founded in 1965 in Albania by Kazimierz Mijal. It was opposed to the Polish United Workers' Party and specifically its leader Władysław Gomułka. It upheld Joseph Stalin against Nikita Khrushchev's criticisms at the 20th Party Congress, instead favoring Maoism and a more hardline stance against the Catholic clergy, which was opposed by Gomułka. Mijal declared himself Secretary General of the "Temporary Central Committee of the Communist Party of Poland" and took control of Radio Tirana's Polish wing. Mijal's rhetoric proved unpopular to both Polish workers and the intelligentsia, and calls for workers to strike against the government failed to gain support. The Party was supported by China, which helped smuggle pamphlets in Poland, and also had support from the Belgian Maoist "La voix du peuple" ("The Voice of the People"), which helped in pamphleteering.
With the Sino-Albanian Split in 1978, Mijal seemed to lose faith in the party (which, since its inception, the Polish government claimed was a puppet of the Communist Party of China and had no support in Poland) and secretly returned to Poland. The party for all practical purposes if not in intent ceased existence after his return.

Los Angeles Flower District

The Flower District of Downtown Los Angeles is a six block floral marketplace, consisting of nearly 200 wholesale flower dealers, located within the LA Fashion District. What started almost 100 years ago as a small flower mart near Santa Monica, California, has grown into the United States' largest wholesale flower district in its current downtown location. The Market is open very early in the morning, Monday - Saturday, and closes in the early afternoon. Every commercially available cut flower can be purchased there.
History.
In the early 1900s, Los Angeles area flower farmers drove their horse-drawn wagons to the downtown Los Angeles produce market to sell their flowers. In 1905, James Vawter, a prominent Santa Monica grower of carnations, established on Spring Street the first dedicated flower market. By 1910, the local Japanese American farmers (54 Issei, first generation Japanese) had organized a flower market, which they incorporated in January 1912. It became known as the Southern California Flower Market and was located for a time at 421 Wall Street. 
Within a few years after, the European immigrants, who could not participate in the Japanese-American flower market, began to come together to offer their locally grown flowers for sale to florists and nursery owners. They organized around 1917 and incorporated in January 1921 as the American Florists' Exchange dba Los Angeles Flower Market. Their first market was on Winston Street between Fourth and Fifth streets.
Eventually, both markets relocated to larger quarters in the 700 block of South Wall Street in Los Angeles, where they operate today as the core of the country's largest flower district. Since those early days, both markets have expanded and modernized and organized together as the Los Angeles Flower District. Several storefront businesses on Wall Street and San Julian Street are also included in the District. The District offers a "badge program" for member florists, event planners and others who qualify to purchase goods at wholesale prices which in 2009 included some 4,500 members.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, dozens of small flower malls and shops came downtown to do business near the renowned, historic Los Angeles Flower District; they consider themselves part of the District. Today, the general public shops throughout the area for its flowers and floral supply products alongside the retail florists and wedding and event planners. The District stretches from San Pedro Street west to Maple Street, from Seventh Street south to Ninth Street. But the two historic, major markets built the strong foundation of trust and quality through tenant-wholesalers who have supplied and shipped fresh flowers to customers across America for almost 100 years. 
The markets are open to the public from 8 to noon. Flowers come from a wide variety of countries, including
A prominent area to check out here is the California Flower Mall. The California Flower Mall is in the heart of the Los Angeles, Flower District. Inside you will find more than of gorgeous fresh cut flowers and potted plants. More than 50 vendors provide floral industry professionals and the general public with exotic blooms from all corners of the earth.

Kilbarchan's Steeple Building has an exterior niche which contains a statue of Simpson. The original statue was carved in wood by Archibald Robertson of Greenock and placed in the niche in 1822. The current statue, dating from 1932, is made of bronze and it replaced the original statue.
During Kilbarchan's annual Lilias Day celebrations, it is customary for the piper to dress up as Habbie Simpson.

Hotspring Island

Hotspring Island, originally named in English as Volcanic Island and known in the Haida language as G̱andll K'in Gwaayaay ("Hot-Water-Island"), is a small island near the southeast coast of Lyell Island in the Haida Gwaii archipelago of the North Coast of British Columbia, Canada. The island's names derive from a hot spring located on its southwestern end, the temperature of which has been measured at . The island is part of Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site and is supervised by the Haida Gwaii Watchmen.
History.
There had once been a Haida village on the island, but little is known of it. Fur trade captain Joseph Ingraham noted steam from the springs when he sailed in the area in 1791 and named it "Smokey Bay". Chief Klue of Tanu escorted a James Poole to the site in 1863 and extolled the value of the "miracle waters" in spite of fears by other Haida of "the Island of Fire". The name "Hotspring Island" was conferred by George M. Dawson when he went ashore there in 1878.
Due to a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on October 27, 2012, the hot spring has stopped flowing and is dry as of November 2012. Some experts, including UBC seismologist Michael Bostock, suggest that the hot spring may resume flowing sometime in the future.
Facilities.
Access to the site is by permit only, usually as part of a tour. Haida Watchmen are posted at the site, as at other locations in the archipelago. There is a bathhouse with a metal tub, fed by the springs, in which visitors are asked to clean themselves before entering the pools proper.

Władysław Ossowski

Wladyslaw Ossowski (born November 5, 1925 in the village of Iwaszkowce near Turka, Poland, died August 5, 2000 in Legnica), was a Polish boyscout and member of the White Couriers.
Using pseudonyms "Maly Wladzio", "Smyk", and "Pitolcio" Ossowski, as a 14-year old boy, began leading Polish escapees from Soviet-occupied Eastern Poland. Between late 1939 and mid-1940, Ossowski, together with a group of Polish scouts mostly from Lwow, led scores of people across Soviet-Hungarian border (see: Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) in the Eastern Carpathians. He would lead to Budapest those Poles who wanted to escape Soviet occupation. From Hungary, he would bring newspapers and directives of General Wladyslaw Sikorski. Ossowski, who was born and raised in the borderland area (before the war, there had been the Polish - Czechoslovakian border), used his knowledge and skills. 
On May 8, 1940, Ossowski was arrested in a house in the village of Komarniki, on the way to Hungary. At first, he was transported to a military prison in Drohobycz, but the process of the whole group of couriers took place in Lwow. Ossowski was sentenced to death, but due to young age, the sentence was changed into 30 years of hard labor. He was taken to a Gulag in Siberia and his nationality was changed from Polish to Ukrainian, which made it impossible for him to return to Poland in latter years. 
Ossowski was released in 1955 and settled in Krasnoyarsk. In the following years, he was arrested multiple times and his adventures were described in a book written by Marek Celt. Despite living in Soviet Union for several years, he never forgot the Lviv dialect of the Polish language. 
In 1991 Ossowski and his family were accidentally found and next year they returned to Poland, after 52 years spent in Siberia. At first he settled in Szczecin, where he tried to run a pizzeria, given to him by a generous person. He frequently met local boyscouts, telling them about his adventures. Some time in late 1990s, Ossowski moved to Legnica, where he died.

Kazimierz Mijal

Kazimierz Mijal (September 15, 1910 – January 28, 2010) was a Polish politician, collaborator of Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut, next dissident, best known for founding the illegal Communist Party of Poland in opposition to the Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP) in 1965. He was born in Wilków Pierwszy.
Biography.
Graduating from a Tradesmen's Association Commercial School in Warsaw, Mijal became active during World War II, collaborating with Paul Finder, Marcel Nowotko and Bolesław Bierut. He served as Mayor of Lodz, chief of the Presidential Chancellery, chief of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers, Minister of Communal Economy, and director of the Investment Bank. He was a long-time member of the CC of the Polish Workers' Party and then the PUWP. Following Nikita Khrushchev's condemnation of former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at the 20th Party Congress in 1956, Mijal aligned with the anti-revisionist movement then led primarily by Mao Zedong. He condemned Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party over his siding with Khrushchev and was an important figure in the so-called Natolin faction of the party. He created various pamphlets condemned by the party as dogmatic and Stalinist, and used a fake passport to leave for Albania, whose leader Enver Hoxha led the anti-revisionist movement along with Mao Zedong.
He founded a new communist party, the Communist Party of Poland (Mijal), declared himself Secretary General of the "Temporary Central Committee of the Communist Party of Poland" and took control of Radio Tirana's Polish wing. Mijal's Maoist rhetoric proved unpopular to both Polish workers and the intelligentsia, and with the Sino-Albanian Split in 1978, Mijal gave up on the party and secretly returned to Poland in 1983. He was arrested in 1984 for distributing pamphlets but was released after three months. He attempted to revive the Communist Party in 1997 but lacked backing. He was also accused throughout his political career of anti-Semitic remarks, a charge that continues to this day.
In 2007 he received honorary membership to the Front Narodowo-Robotniczy. He has written for the "Fatherland Weekly", a left-nationalist newspaper. Mijal was an opponent of the EU.
He died in January 2010 in Warsaw, Poland. He was buried on the grounds of Warsaw Reformed Cemetery on Zytnia street.

Fritz Keller

Frédéric "Fritz" Keller (born Friedrich Keller, 21 August 1913 – 8 June 1985) was a German-born French footballer who played as a forward in the Première division for RC Strasbourg, and for the France national team. He was born in Strasbourg.
Club career.
Born to an Alsatian mother and a German father in what was then Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen, Fritz Keller was the second and arguably the most talented of the three Keller brothers (Albert, Fritz, Curt) who all played as professionals for RC Strasbourg in the 1930s. He was a key member of the Strasbourg team that finished second in the 1934-35 Championship and reached the final of the cup in 1937.
When Alsace was "de facto" annexed by the Third Reich, Fritz Keller elected to play for SS side SG SS Straßburg in the Gauliga Elsaß rather than continuing with RC Strasbourg's ersatz, Rasensport Club Straßburg. According to some of his former teammates at RCS, this was more an opportunistic move than a real ideological gesture as the SS were offering significant rewards to build up the best team in Alsace.
National team.
Keller had his first cap for France on 10 May 1934 against the Netherlands and participated in World Cup 1934, playing one game against Austria's "Wunderteam". He was the first RC Strasbourg player to earn a cap with the national team. His younger brother Curt Keller also had one cap with France in 1937 but, at that time, Fritz's career for the national team had ended.

T-HCA

T-HCA, or "trans"-4-hydroxycrotonic acid, is a drug used in scientific research. It is structurally related to GHB and binds to the GHB receptor with 4-fold higher affinity than GHB itself, but is not an agonist for the primary sedative target of GHB, the GABAB receptor, and so does not produce sedative effects, instead causing convulsions thought to be mediated through increased glutamate release. It may also be naturally produced in the mammalian CNS and is suspected to be an endogenous ligand for the GHB receptor.

400 skeletons were found here that had been buried for some 500 years, when the Spanish first invaded the Aztec Kingdom. Evidence at the site provides clues about native resistance to Spanish invasions, as it is the earliest known occurrence of the capture and sacrifice of Europeans. "This is the first place that has so much evidence there was resistance to the conquest," said archeologist Enrique Martinez, director of the dig here. "It shows it wasn't all submission."[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/26/science/sci-aztec26] There is also evidence of cannibalism, with both tooth and knife markings on bones found in the mass graves.

Pyrotherapy

Pyrotherapy (artificial fever, therapeutic fever) is a method of treatment by raising the body temperature or sustaining an elevated body temperature (caused by a fever). In general, the body temperature was maintained at 41° Celsius. Many diseases were treated by this method in the first half of the 20th century. In general, it was done by exposing the patient to hot baths, warm air, (electric) blankets, or high-frequency steam. 
Use.
One example is the treatment of syphilis by the introduction of malaria, for which Julius Wagner-Jauregg won Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1927.
The general paresis of the insane caused by neurosyphilis was effectively overcome by the method.
Pyrotherapy was also employed in psychiatry. Of note here is the use of sulfozinum and pyrogenal that was relatively widespread in Soviet psychiatry.

Morane-Saulnier T

__NOTOC__
The Morane-Saulnier T was a bomber aircraft developed in France in 1914 and produced in small numbers during World War I. It was a large, five-bay biplane of conventional configuration, with unstaggered wings of equal span. The conical rear fuselage and large triangular tailfin were reminiscent of a scaled-up version of some Morane-Saulnier fighter designs. The engines were mounted tractor-fashion in streamlined nacelles supported by struts in the interplane gap and the propellers were fitted with large spinners. The undercarriage consisted of two main units, each of which had two wheels joined by a long axle, plus a tailskid and an auxiliary nosewheel. Three open cockpits in tandem were provided: one in the nose for a gunner, and others for the pilot and a second gunner placed further back.
Although designed as a bomber, the French Army ordered the type in 1916 hoping to use it either as a bomber escort or reconnaissance machine. While this order called for 100 aircraft, only a small number were built before production was cancelled.

Craig Kauffman

Craig Kauffman (March 31, 1932 – May 9, 2010) was an artist who has exhibited since 1951. Kauffman’s primarily abstract paintings and wall relief sculptures are included in over 20 museum collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tate Modern, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Seattle Art Museum, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.
Life and career.
Kauffman first exhibited at the Felix Landau Gallery in Los Angeles, and was included in other Los Angeles group exhibits during the early 1950s. He was a member of the original group of artists at the Ferus Gallery (founded in 1957 by Edward Kienholz and Walter Hopps), and had a one-person show at that gallery in 1958. According to critic and historian Peter Plagens, the 1958 paintings were: 
…Abstract Expressionist but contain the first evidence of a Los Angeles sensibility: "Tell Tale Heart" (1958) is structured superficially along the lines of a second-generation New York painting, but it reveals the original stem-and-bulb shapes that Kauffman was later to translate into Plexiglas. The ‘clean’ Abstract Expressionist work of Craig Kauffman could be the point at which Los Angeles art decided to live on its own life-terms, instead of those handed down from Paris, New York, or even San Francisco.
In several series of wall relief sculptures made between 1964 and 1970, Kauffman pioneered the use of acrylic plastic as a support for painting. Craig Kauffman’s wall relief sculptures are his most well known work. Throughout his career, Kauffman has explored the use of unorthodox materials. Art historian Susan C. Larsen notes:
Kauffman’s work has maintained its radiant color and its emphasis on certain sensuous physical properties of his materials. 
Through his integration of sprayed color and shape, Kauffman achieved the visual presence of his vacuum formed acrylic wall reliefs. Works from the late 1960s have been described by former Whitney museum curator Richard Armstrong as:
Glossy and symmetrical, the work’s visually wet surface engenders anatomical, sometimes overtly sexual, comparisons.
Curators and historians now regard Kauffman’s works from the late 1960s in relation to the art movement known as Minimalism. Susan L. Jenkins wrote:
…his works, as well as others associated with the L.A. Look, can nevertheless be thought of as possessing a relatively Minimalist sensibility. Like Judd’s ‘specific objects’, Kauffman’s vacuum-formed plastic works exist in a space between painting and sculpture.
Kauffman continued painting after that period, and his works have been included in exhibitions such as "Time and Place: Los Angeles 1957-1968", at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm in 2008, at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and "A Minimal Future? Art as Object 1958-1968", The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, 2004.

Württemberg T 4

The Württemberg T 4 was a class of German, eight-coupled, goods train, tank locomotive operated by the Royal Württemberg State Railways.
When the T 3 locomotives were no longer capable of banking services on the Geislinger Steige, a locomotive was designed that was to develop twice the power. Because no more locomotives were needed for duties on the ramps, only eight were produced, of which five were supplied in 1906 and three in 1909. In their day they were the heaviest eight-coupled locomotives in Germany.
In designing the boiler, special emphasis had been laid on a large steam space and a low-lying firebox crown so that banking could be achieved with refilling with water, which led to a reduction in boiler pressure and a resultant drop in performance.
In order to reduce wear and tear on the tyres and brake shoes during descents, the engines were fitted with Riggenbach counterpressure brakes.
In 1925 the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over all eight locomotives and grouped them into DRG Class 92.1 in their numbering plan. After the Second World War they ended up in the Deutsche Bundesbahn, where they were retired between 1946 and 1948 or sold as industrial locomotives.

Boris Vildé (25 June Old Style/8 July 1908 - 23 February 1942) was a linguist and ethnographer at the Musée de l'Homme, in Paris, France. He specialised in polar civilizations. He was born in St. Petersburg into a family of Eastern orthodox Russians. His family moved to Tartu, Estonia in 1919. He studied at the University of Tartu, before moving to France. 
Vildé was active in the French Resistance during World War II. During the resistance he led the scientists and lawyers of the Groupe du musée de l'Homme in producing an anti-Nazi and Vichy newspaper, called "Résistance". The group, one of the first résistance units, was infiltrated by a Vichy supporter and as a result most of them were arrested, tried and the men among them sentenced to death. He was killed by firing squad, together with Léon-Maurice Nordmann, Georges Ithier, Jules Andrieu, René Sénéchal, Pierre Walter and Anatole Lewitsky, on 23 February 1942 at Fort Mont-Valérien. They are buried in the cemetery at Ivry-sur-Seine.

History of marriage in California

The recorded history of marriage in California is long and encompasses a period as far back as the first Spanish missions and even further back in unrecorded history of native American Indians and their marriage rituals.
California was incorporated into the United States of America in 1850.
California Native American marriage.
While the Native Americans of California did not document their culture in the same way western civilization did, we still have a great deal of knowledge from archaeological evidence as well as the earliest records of the Spanish missions.
Native communities in southern California of the Chumash Indians, practiced Matrilocal residence. The husband would move to the community of the wife. The exception to this rule being the chief, whose wife would move to live with the chiefs community. The chief was also the only one of the community with the option of multiple marriage.
Jesuit Missionary period 1697–1767.
The founding of the California missionary system by the Spanish began in 1697 located in Baja with the founding of Nuestra Senora de Loreto. Several times during the Jesuit period, Indians revolted against church doctrine against polygamy.
Clemente Guillen, S. J., of Delores mission in Baja California reported in 1744 that he had destroyed the tables and paraphernalia of the Indian shaman and that same year Joseph de Torres Pereas noted the survival of marriage ceremonies indicated that shaman had been convincing adults not to accept baptism.
Marriage, California natives and the Spanish missions, 1785–1810.
While the Franciscan Missions strived to incorporate the native California Indians into their fold, they worked hard to eliminate all marriage and family customs the Spanish Catholic Church disapproved of or found repugnant.
The church was anxious to legitimize the marriages of natives through Catholic ceremonies. Northern California Missions recorded the marriage of 2300 marriages of Native Americans previously joined by native custom with five thousand new unions and ten thousand neophyte widows and widower remarried.
Marriage between native Indian woman and Spanish men was encouraged by the California missions to increase the population and Spanish political power. Rape and other forms of violence was however a concern. Spanish Soldiers and settlers of a patriarchal colonial society put native woman in a vulnerable state.
Author, Charles Francis Saunders has documented the details of a California Mission wedding ceremony from 1890s in his book, "Capistrano Nights – Tales of a California Mission Town".
1829 Carrillo-Fitch elopement.
In 1829 a controversy erupted when the Spanish Governor was asked to intervene in the marriage between a local San Diego Spanish woman and a foreigner.
Maria Antonia Natalia Elija Carrillo was born November 27, 1810. Called Josefa, after her Grandmother, she was the eldest of thirteen children born to Maria Ygnacia Lopez and Joaquin Victor Carrillo. Influential and socially well connected, the family was related to several other prominent Californians of the day. At the time the youth of California were pressured to marry early.
Instead of marrying another Californian, Carrillo fell in love with American merchant seaman, Henry Delano Fitch. Fitch formally requested the hand of Maria Antonia in 1827.
On April 15, 1829, the ceremony was in progress, but was stopped by order of Governor Jose Maria Echeandia. It is believed that the Governor was enraged by Carrillo's choice of a man who refused to naturalize as a citizen, as well as rumored smuggling activity.
The couple eloped in Valparaiso Chile and upon returning to California 1830, Echeandia announced the marriage as "Illegal" and had Fitch imprisoned and placed Carrillo in "Deposito", the practice of separating couples to ascertain if they married of their own accord.
Carrillo was held in San Gabriel and Fitch in Monterrey. In December 1830, ecclesiastic authorities found the marriage valid but not legitimate under canon law. To end the scandal, the couple was ordered to pay penance in the order of attending special mass and reciting prayer.
1850 statehood to 1872.
On September 8, 1850, California entered the US as the 31st state of the union. At the time marriage statutes described marriage as "a civil contract to which the consent of the parties is required" with gender specific pronouns applied to "husband" and "wife". Later court decisions and some statutes dating from both statehood and the 1872 codification of the civil law state; "Any unmarried male of the age of 18 years or upward and any unmarried female of the age of 15 years old or upward are capable of consenting to and consummating marriage." The code makes no mention of what gender may marry which.
Ban on interracial marriage.
In 1850, "all marriages of white persons with Negroes or mulattoes declared to be illegal and void". This stricture held until 1948, at which point the California Supreme Court became the first state court in the country to strike down a law prohibiting interracial marriage, recognizing marriage as a fundamental right:
Marriage is thus something more than a civil contract subject to regulation by the state; it is a fundamental right of free men. There can be no prohibition of marriage except for an important social objective and by reasonable means. No law within the broad areas of state interest may be unreasonably discriminatory or arbitrary... The right to marry is as fundamental as the right to send one’s child to a particular school or the right to have offspring. Indeed, “We are dealing here with legislation which involves one of the basic civil rights of man. Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.” (Skinner v. Oklahoma, supra, at p. 541.) Legislation infringing such rights must be based upon more than prejudice and must be free from oppressive discrimination to comply with the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection of the laws.
Poorly kept records.
While the state required records be kept on marriage certificates and contracts as early as 1851, it wasn't until 1858 that any further information was kept, such as births, divorce and death. At that time the office of the state Registrar was created.
Contemporary history.
In 2001, same-sex couples (including Davina Kotulski and Molly McKay) from Marriage Equality USA began asking for marriage licenses in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The issue of same-sex marriage reemerged in 2004, when Mayor of San Francisco Gavin Newsom directed the city-county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing the California Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law to all groups. The marriages were quickly annulled by the California Supreme Court, and the city of San Francisco issued a legal challenge that was consolidated with other challenges to California's marriage laws. Meanwhile, the California legislature twice passed, and twice received vetos from governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on, bills that would have legalized same-sex marriages in the state.
On May 15, 2008, at a time when only the Massachusetts Supreme Court had ruled favorably on same-sex marriage, the California Supreme Court ruled on the 2004 San Franciscan challenge with other cases in the watershed In re Marriage Cases. Applying strict scrutiny to the state's discrimination between heterosexual and other citizens, marriage was found to be a fundamental right that may not be denied based on sexual orientation, and the relevant laws were struck down.
Social conservatives and other dissenters capitalized on the case to renew its thrice-unsuccessful push to amend the Constitution of California to restrict marriage to being between opposite-sex couples, and with unprecedented support from the Catholic and LDS churches, succeeded by a slim margin of votes. One year later, the proposition was verified as legal by the California Supreme Court, but not held to be retroactive, so the state of California only recognizes opposite-sex marriages, except for the same-sex marriages granted before the constitutional change in 2008 (including 18,000 marriages granted by California and possibly same-sex marriages granted by other jurisdictions before that date, although a test case has not yet arisen). Prop 8 was eventually overturned by the California Supreme Court but a stay was placed on same sex marriages until an appeal could be heard. Both, Governor Jerry Brown and Attorney General, Kamala Harris had declined to defend the proposition during the appeals process, so the courts allowed the proponents of the amendment to stand for the state government and appeal the decision. All appeals were denied up to the United States Supreme Court, who refused to hear the appeal based on the lack of standing by the appealing parties.

Splash FM

Splash FM is a United Kingdom radio station, based in Worthing, West Sussex, and operated by Media Sound Holdings Ltd. The station plays a selection of hit songs from the last forty years, and offers regular updates on local news, sport, travel and events. The station also works with a number of local charities and organisations, and can regularly be seen broadcasting from events in their transmission area.
The station serves the towns of Worthing, Shoreham and Littlehampton - plus the many surrounding villages.
History.
The station was created in May 2003 by local residents Roy Stannard and David Cunningham who had collaborated on local RSL and hospital radio projects, when the team they assembled won the broadcast licence for the Worthing area. Veteran television and radio broadcaster David Hamilton broadcast the first show live from the studios within Worthing's Guildbourne Centre.
The original presenters at the time of launch were:
Simon Osborne<br>
Kevin Spector<br>
Dave Adams<br>
Gina Milson<br>
John Roberts<br>
Dave Hunt<br>
Nick Hatfield<br>
Pete McIntosh<br>
David Cunningham<br>
Dave Benson Philips<br>
Patrick Woodward<br>
Karen Morton<br>
David Hamilton<br>
In April 2008 the station became part of Media Sound Holdings, after merging with neighbouring radio station Mid Sussex-based Bright FM.
In June 2009, Media Sound Holdings added Arrow FM in Hastings and Sovereign FM in Eastbourne to their collection from TLRC. 
In November 2010, Ofcom approved Media Sound Holdings's application to share all content across their four stations, given that the stations "already share all programming outside of breakfast, so these changes will not substantially alter the character of the service."
The Splash FM Garden Party.
Splash FM hosts a hugely popular open-air concert each summer in Worthing's Steyne Gardens, attracting thousands of locals and tourists alike. Originally a free concert with major funding from a locally based national company, the event has evolved into "The Garden Party" in 2009 - a tribute festival held over one or two nights, with affordable ticket prices, and a mix of tribute acts.
During the 2010 party, Worthing Borough Council received twelve complaints of excessive noise and vibration. The council had agreed a noise limit before the event of 66dB, but on both nights levels measured 90dB and officers were "shocked at the level of exceedance of the prescribed noise limits". Permission for 2011 required the organisers to appoint new sound engineers and work with the council's team to keep noise to a "reasonable minimum." If noise in 2011 exceeds the agreed level the council could be asked not to approve further concerts.
For the second year running, the 2011 event was held over two days on 22 July and 23 July, and featured the following tribute acts:
The 2012 event had the subtitle of "The Best Of The Best", and brought back the two most popular headline acts from the last three years, after a listener vote in February 2012. Performing on 21 July were Michael Jackson tribute 'Navi' (headliner in 2010) and Madness tribute band "The Los Palmas 6" (headliner in 2009). After bad weather threatened to cancel the event in the weeks preceding, conditions improved hugely in the week preceding, and led to a sell out crowd.
The 2013 Garden Party took place on Saturday 20 July, with a line up consisting of Queen tribute "The Great Pretender and H.R.H.", plus Elton John tribute "Rocket Man". Support on the night was be provided by local acts "The Alice Band" and "JAG", a band who have been regulars at recent years' events. Their 2013 performance, however, was their last ahead of going their separate ways.
Chris Copsey's death.
On 11 January 2011, breakfast show host Chris Copsey died suddenly. It is believed he collapsed in a Sainsbury's store, just hours after presenting his breakfast show.
Chris (also known as Coppo) had been on the airwaves across Sussex for over 25 years. He was a former presenter for the breakfast show on Southern Sound, soon to become Southern FM.
In 2009, shortly after the Heart brand took over Southern FM, Chris moved to Media Sound Holdings to present the mid-morning show and revive his 'Retro Show' on Sunday afternoons. He moved to do the breakfast show shortly after that. As well as Splash FM, Chris could also be heard on the other three stations owned by Media Sound Holdings.
Chris leaves behind his wife Yvonne and two children.

Ivan Jakovlevich Fojnickij

Ivan Jakovlevich Fojnickij () (1847–1913) was a leading theorist of criminal law in the late Russian Empire.
In 1877, Fojnickij was appointed senior public prosecutor in Saint Petersburg. He was also the chairman of the Russian section of the International Union of Criminologists and taught law at the Saint Petersburg State University from 1881 onwards.
A liberal constitutionalist and a follower of Franz von Liszt's theory of criminal law, Fojnickij was one of the principal advocates of criminal justice reform in Russia. The modernised Russian penal code of 1903 as well as the introduction of suspended sentences and prison labour in Russia trace back to proposals of his.

Non-dictatorship

In voting theory, non-dictatorship is a property of social choice functions, where the results cannot simply mirror that of any ONE single person's preferences without consideration of the other voters. Fairness requires that the social welfare function take into account the desires of more than one voter. In other words, there is no one voter with P as his/her individual preference order, such that P is the societal ("winning") preference order, unless all voters have the same P. Thus, as long as there are voters in the society that have different preference orderings, the preferences of individual "i" should not always prevail.
Non-dictatorship: No voter in the society is a dictator in the sense that, there does not exist a single voter "i" in the society such that for every set of orderings in the domain and every pair of distinct social states "x" and "y", if voter "i" strictly prefers "x" over "y", "x" is socially selected over "y".
Anonymous voting systems (with at least two voters) automatically satisfy the non-dictatorship property.

Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool

Fatigue is a major human factors issue in aviation safety. The Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST) was developed by the United States Air Force in 2000–2001 to address the problem of aircrew fatigue in aircrew flight scheduling. FAST is a Windows program that allows scientists, planners and schedulers to quantify the effects of various work-rest schedules on human performance. It allows work and sleep data entry in graphic, symbolic (grid) and text formats. The graphic input-output display shows cognitive performance effectiveness (y axis) as a function of time (x axis). An upper, green area on the graph ends at the time for normal sleep, 90% effectiveness. The goal of the planner or scheduler is to keep performance effectiveness at or above 90% by manipulating the timing and lengths of work and rest periods. A work schedule is entered as red bands on the time line. Sleep periods are entered as blue bands across the time line, below the red bands. 
The calculated performance effectiveness represents composite human performance on a number of cognitive tasks, scaled from zero to 100%. The oscillating line in the graph represents expected group average performance on these tasks as determined by time of day, circadian rhythm, time spent awake, and amount of sleep, and various confidence limits around the average may be displayed. The graphic display may be cut and pasted into reports and briefing slides. Cognitive effectiveness estimates for work periods of any length may also be cut and pasted in tabular format.
History.
FAST was developed under Phase 1 and 2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract awards from the US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Human Effectiveness Directorate, to NTI, Inc., (Dr. Douglas R. Eddy, Principal Investigator) with Science Applications International Corporation as a subcontractor (Dr. Steven R. Hursh, Modeler). Fatigue predictions in FAST are derived from the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness (SAFTE) simulation invented by Dr. Hursh, currently the President of the Institutes for Behavior Resources and Adjunct Professor of Behavioral Biology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. 
The SAFTE simulation integrates quantitative information about (1) the circadian rhythm in metabolic rate; (2) cognitive performance recovery rates associated with sleep, and cognitive performance decay rates associated with wakefulness; and (3) cognitive performance effects associated with sleep inertia to produce a 3-process model of human cognitive effectiveness. The SAFTE model has been under development by Dr. Hursh for more than a decade. In the general architecture of the SAFTE model, a circadian process influences both cognitive effectiveness and sleep regulation. Sleep regulation is dependent upon hours of sleep, hours of wakefulness, current sleep debt, the circadian process and sleep fragmentation (awakenings during a sleep period). Cognitive effectiveness is dependent upon the current balance of the sleep regulation process, the circadian process, and sleep inertia. 
The SAFTE simulation has received a broad scientific review and the DoD considers it a complete, accurate, and operationally practical model to aid operator scheduling. The SAFTE simulation's software implementation and applicabilities have since been validated in both aviation (Eddy and Hursh, 2008; need ref) and railroad work environments.
During the Phase 2 effort, the model was refined with findings from AF research and other studies providing a blood alcohol index, lapse index, sleep timing algorithm, and interface features (performance variation percentiles, mission timeline, grid input, and fatigue factors dashboard, to name a few). FAST provided the military physiologist the first computerized tool that used a homeostatic model for optimizing aviator performance under conditions of limited sleep while minimizing the need for pharmacological aids. Missions could be planned that provided sufficient rest to maintain effective performance and, when normal, nocturnal sleep was impossible, arrange interventions such as naps or pharmacological treatments to maintain performance. The tool was intended to improve flight safety, optimize mission success during sustained operations, and minimize the need for pharmacological aids. 
During the Phase 2 and Phase 3 efforts, the FAST team had the opportunity to train different groups of AF personnel on the use of FAST to solve fatigue problems they were having with sustained operations, overseas deployment, and night training operations. The training was accomplished with numerous groups in part through several of the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine’s educational functions (2002–2007) and in part through the AFRL Aviation Fatigue Countermeasures Workshop taught approximately tri-annually by Drs. John A. Caldwell, J. Lynn Caldwell, and James C. Miller. Students over the years included flight surgeons, aerospace physiologists and aerospace physiology technicians on annual training; aerospace physiologists and aerospace physiology technicians during initial training; flight surgeons participating in USAFSAM’s Residency in Aerospace Medicine (RAM) and Advanced Aerospace medicine for International Medical officers (AAMIMO) programs; and aviation safety officers from The U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marines, and Army, and from the Canadian Forces. Many of these new users recommended that the FAST product be transformed in several ways to make it more useful to operational units.
FAST was used successfully by the development team, Air Force researchers, and several AF operational units to solve fatigue problems throughout AF operations. Scientists in the Warfighter Fatigue Countermeasures Branch (WFC, now AFRL/RHPF) and operators used FAST to identify and avoid fatigue in more than 2,000 hours of B-2 Spirit bomber operations from Whiteman AFB and night operations at Shaw AFB, to optimize shift work schedules for security forces at Brooks AFB, to assess the impact of sleep loss and night operations in accident investigation, and many other consults. During the period 2000–2007, Dr. Miller used FAST to assist USAF mishap investigation boards in at least nine investigations of aviation mishaps. Additionally, FAST was used to prepare guidance for various operational units in the United States and Canada. These FAST users had no problems entering data, trying different schedules, making modifications to existing schedules, or interpreting results. However, all of these applications involved experts or personnel that they had trained. Attempts to apply FAST to daily flying scheduling operations were unsuccessful because the user interface was designed originally for scientists, not for operators.
The Federal Railroad Administration sponsored a major evaluation of the SAFTE biomathematical fatigue model (or simulation) to determine if it could predict increased risk of railroad accidents based on work schedule information (Hursh, Raslear et al., 2006). The project examined 30-day work histories of locomotive crews prior to 400 human factors accidents and 1000 nonhuman factors accidents. SAFTE estimated crew effectiveness (the inverse of fatigue) based entirely on work schedule information and opportunities to obtain sleep. Over 1 million 30-min work intervals were evaluated based on data from five US freight railroads. A reliable linear relationship existed between crew effectiveness and the risk of human factors accidents (r = - 0.93), but not for non-human factors accidents. The risk of human factors accidents was elevated at effectiveness scores below 90 and increased progressively with reduced effectiveness. At an effectiveness score ≤ 50, human factors accidents were 65 percent more likely than chance. Below an effectiveness score of 70, accident cause codes indicated the kinds of operator errors consistent with fatigue, confirming that the relationship between accident risk and effectiveness was meaningful. Further analysis indicated that SAFTE/FAST also predicted an increase in accident severity; human factors accidents that occurred when average effectiveness was calculated to be less than 77 were 2½ times more costly than similar accidents that occurred when effectiveness was greater than 90.
In 2005, AFRL awarded a 3-year, Phase 3 SBIR contract to NTI to develop and demonstrate a browser-based, predictive and quantitative fatigue-management software tool for mission planning, crew performance assessment, and status reporting, based upon FAST. A “24/7 Operational Effectiveness Toolset” was developed as an Internet-based tool accessible through a browser, providing support for the scheduling of regular, cyclic work and rest (regularly rotating shiftwork), for irregular work-rest schedules, for the effects of pharmaceutical countermeasures, and for the formal Operational Risk Management (ORM) of fatigue effects. Specific user groups selected for interface design included mission (flight) schedulers, pilots, mishap investigators, and shift work schedulers. Usability tests of the interfaces were conducted to determine if they met the needs of expert users and the tool was easy to learn for novices. The final reports for this project were reviewed at AFRL in November 2008. The project was never brought to fruition.
Present status.
FAST is now a commercial product marketed through Fatigue Science (fatiguescience.com).
U.S. Navy.
In the U.S. Navy, Aviation Safety Officer (ASO) students and prospective commanders of naval aviation squadrons began to be introduced to FAST in the School of Aviation Safety (SAS) courses in October 2004. Navy and Army student Flight Surgeons received a 2-hour computer lab introduction to FAST. CAPT (Dr.) Nick Davenport was the person who added FAST to those curricula. As a result of a FAST evaluation meeting that was held at the Naval Safety Center (NSC) on 26 April 2006, the NSC mandated that all Flight Surgeons use FAST in analyzing the 72-hour and 14-day histories in aviation mishap investigations. FAST has often assisted in identifying fatigue effects that would have been missed otherwise, and occasionally has helped rule out fatigue in cases where it was suspected.
FlyAwake.
In early 2007, the 201 Airlift Squadron of the District of Columbia Air National Guard (ANG), successfully integrated its own version of the SAFTE simulation into its daily scheduling operations. This version was never validated against the original SAFTE simulation. This integration required the full-time attention of two pilot schedulers, but yielded valuable risk mitigation data that could be used by planners and leaders to predict and adjust critical times of fatigue in the flight schedule. In August 2007, the Air National Guard Aviation Safety Division, under the direction of Lt Col Edward Vaughan, funded a project to provide a user interface for daily use by pilot schedulers and integration with automated flight scheduling software. This user-responsive interface, known as 'FlyAwake', was conceived and managed by Captain Lynn Lee. The project cited empirical data collected in combat and non-combat aviation operations, and challenged existing crew rest policies as adequate in preventing degraded human performance.

The steam locomotive class k.u.k HB 578 was a tank engine operated by the Imperial and Royal Military Field Railway ("k.u.k. Heeresfeldbahn") in Austria-Hungary.
In World War I, the Austrian Military Railway placed their order for additional locomotives with Henschel in Kassel, because the Austrian locomotive factories were working at full capacity.
These 22 locomotives had typical Prussian features and were grouped into Class 578.
After the war's end, 10 engines were left in Poland as PKP Class TKp101 and twelve with the BBÖ, which retained their classification and serial numbers and set them to work as shunters on the large Viennese railway stations.
In 1938, the Deutsche Reichsbahn classified them as 92.2101–2112. Seven Polish TKp101 also joined the DRG during the course of fighting in the Second World War and were numbered 92.2113–2119.
After the end of the war, eight engines were left with the ÖBB, which were classifeid as ÖBB Class 292 and retained their serial numbers. They were retired by 1966.

Unrestricted domain

In social choice theory, unrestricted domain, or universality, is a property of social welfare functions in which all preferences of all voters (but no other considerations) are allowed. Intuitively, unrestricted domain is a common requirement for social choice functions, and is a condition for Arrow's impossibility theorem.
With unrestricted domain, the social welfare function accounts for all preferences among all voters to yield a unique and complete ranking of societal choices. Thus, the voting mechanism must account for all individual preferences, it must do so in a manner that results in a complete ranking of preferences for society, and it must deterministically provide the same ranking each time voters' preferences are presented the same way.
Relation to Arrow's impossibility theorem.
Unrestricted domain is one of the conditions for Arrow's impossibility theorem. Under that theorem, it is impossible to have a social choice function that satisfies "unrestricted domain", "Pareto efficiency", "independence of irrelevant alternatives", and "non-dictatorship". However, the conditions of the theorem can be satisfied if unrestricted domain is removed.
Examples of restricted domains.
Duncan Black defined a restriction to domains of social choice functions called ""single-peaked preferences"". Under this principle, all of the choices have a predetermined position along a line, giving them a linear ordering. Every voter has some special place she likes best along that line. Her ordering of the choices is determined by their distances from that spot. For example, if voting on where to set the volume for music, it would be reasonable to assume that each voter had their own ideal volume preference and that as the volume got progressively too loud or too quiet they would be increasingly dissatisfied. Black proved that by replacing unrestricted domain with single-peaked preferences in Arrow's theorem removes the impossibility: there are Pareto-efficient non-dictatorships that satisfy IIA.

Nauzet Alemán Viera (born 25 February 1985 in Las Palmas, Canary Islands), simply known as Nauzet, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for UD Las Palmas in Segunda División, mainly as a right midfielder.
Club career.
Nauzet made his debuts with hometown's UD Las Palmas during 2003–04's second division, playing ten games for an eventual relegation. He subsequently became an automatic first-choice.
In the 2005–06 season, Nauzet was instrumental as the Canary Islands outfit once again returned to the second level: in the last minutes of a match at Real Sociedad B, in the first round of the promotion play-offs, he scored a goal which would relegate the Basque. Additionally, in the decisive contest against CD Linares, he set up Marcos Márquez for the game's only goal.
In July 2009 Nauzet, having not renewed his link to Las Palmas, signed with La Liga side Real Valladolid, penning a three-year contract. He made his league debut on 30 August as a starter at UD Almería, being sacrificed in the 15th minute of the game after defender Nivaldo was sent off (eventual 0–0 draw); he then proceeded to net four times in the next six matches, namely twice against Deportivo de La Coruña on 25 October (4–0 home win), but the Castile and León side was eventually relegated at the season's end.
On 8 September 2011, Nauzet scored four goals against Gimnàstic de Tarragona for the campaign's Copa del Rey, in a 6–0 home win.

The Edwin Mellen Press is a Lewiston, New York-based publishing house founded by religion scholar Herbert Richardson. It describes itself as "a non-subsidy academic publisher of books in the humanities and social science", but has been described by others as a vanity press.
The Press has received criticism for taking legal action against its critics. In 1993 it brought a libel suit against the magazine "Lingua Franca", which it lost. In 2012 it brought a similar suit for $3.5 million against McMaster University and a librarian hired there in 2011 over a blog posting he made in 2010. This suit has been criticized by the Canadian Association of University Teachers and others as an attempt to use legal action to silence criticism whose publication is an exercise of academic freedom.
Created by Martha Reineke, a professor of religion at the University of Northern Iowa, a petition demanding the Press drop its lawsuits had garnered more than 3,100 names as of March 4, 2013. On that date, the Press announced that it had discontinued the court case against McMaster University and Dale Askey, but not the lawsuit against Askey personally.
On March 21, 2013, Edwin Mellen Press threatened legal action against The Society for Scholarly Publishing for hosting allegedly libelous blog posts and comments on The Scholarly Kitchen. The Scholarly Kitchen removed the content in question from its website on March 29, 2013. It restored the blog post, though not the comment alleged to be libellous, a few days later, and published a blog post explaining its actions. In April 2013, the Press threatened to take legal action against the interim library dean of the University of Utah, over blog posts he wrote criticising the Press for its legal action against Askey.
Earlier aspects of this controversy have been studied by sociologist Kenneth Westhues in his book "The Envy of Excellence: Administrative Mobbing of High Achieving Professors", a title published by the Edwin Mellen Press.

Marilyn Kaytor

Marilyn Kaytor (July 26, 1929 – October 20, 2007) was an American journalist, editor and author internationally known for writing about cooking, style, and fashion.
Life and career.
Kaytor was born Marilyn Miller on July 26, 1929, in Kinmundy, Illinois. Her father, Arno Hugo Miller, was formerly a clerk in the Chicago Stock Yards and, later, a banking executive. Her mother, Dorcas Harvey Miller, was, at one time, a stenographer in an automobile factory. She attended local schools. In October 1951 she received her Bachelor of Science Degree in home economics from the University of Illinois. In 1952 Kaytor moved to New York City to attend graduate school at Columbia University. 
Soon thereafter, Kaytor began her career as one of the first journalists to write about food for a mass audience. In the early 1950s she started writing about international cuisine and cooking for newspapers and magazines. This led to a position at "Look" magazine, a popular bi-weekly general interest publication.
At "Look" magazine.
For 12 years Kaytor was "Look's" food editor. In the era before there were professional food writers, Kaytor stood out. She conceived the ideas for her articles, traveled to scout locations, gathered props, tested recipes, and styled the photo shoots. These took her around the world.
During the 1960s, Kaytor hired prominent photographers from the fashion world to work on her photo shoots. Among these were Irving Penn, Hiro, and Arthur Rothstein. The visually stunning food layouts were artistic enough to be added to collections in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Library of Congress.
At a time when Americans were just starting to wake up to foreign cuisine, notably French, she told a mass audience about cooking international dishes. She presented stories on food from the West Indies to the Balkans. For example, when Julia Child was beginning to make French cooking popular, Kaytor, in 1963, wrote that more than any other culture in the world, the French “have elevated cooking to a fine creative art.” She said, “good food and wine, plus good company and conversation, are as important to the French as the quality of the music they listen to and the paintings they look at.” 
Writing career.
For almost forty years, Kaytor wrote about food and style. Despite the demise of Look in 1971, Kaytor continued to sell freelance articles. She wrote for the "New York Times, "Esquire", New York, the Los Angeles Times, Bon Appétit, The Saturday Evening Post, Pageant", and many others.
In 1975 Kaytor wrote "“21” The Life and Times of New York’s Favorite Club". The 175-page illustrated book was published by the Viking Press to wide acclaim; it remains the definitive book about the 21 Club. 
In 1981 Kaytor traveled to the White House to write an article for the "New York Times" about the Family Dining Room. She described First Lady Nancy Reagan’s taste: “Yellow is the predominant color, and she has added furniture from her California home, colorful fabrics, needlepoint pillows and a gallery of pictures of family and friends.” 
Personal life.
Kaytor's first husband was fellow Kinmundy native Richard Maulding. They were married on June 8, 1947. The couple, both graduates of Kinmundy-Alma High School, briefly attended Southern Illinois University at Carbondale before transferring to the University of Illinois. Maulding later became an anesthesiologist, practicing in Carbondale. 
Kaytor's second husband was painter Albert Kaytor, of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, whom she met at the University of Illinois. They were married on Feb. 9, 1952, at Queen of All Saints Roman Catholic Church in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The couple lived in Brooklyn after their wedding. Albert Kaytor, an instructor at Pratt Institute, rose to become associate art director for CBS. He died in 1963.
Kaytor became involved with author and journalist Robert Ruark at this time. She lived in Ruark’s villa in Palamos, Spain, and the couple was planning a wedding in 1965 when Ruark died in London of complications from alcoholism. Ruark left his Spanish estate to Kaytor, a bequest that was unsuccessfully challenged by Ruark’s family in court.
Kaytor was married and divorced at least one other time: in the late 1960s to Manhattan art dealer Walter Randel.
Death and legacy.
On Oct. 20, 2007, Kaytor was discovered dead in her second-floor apartment at 111 East 79th Street, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Kaytor had lived in the apartment for about thirty years. Firefighters were called to an apartment fire and found Kaytor’s body in bed. The New York Medical Examiner’s office determined that Kaytor had died of natural causes, yet the fire department determined the source of the fire was likely caused by Kaytor smoking in bed.
Kaytor’s remains were returned to her home state of Illinois for burial.
Following Kaytor’s death, some of the contents of her apartment were sold at auction by Doyle New York. Among these were twin elephant tusks that had belonged to Robert Ruark for $25,000; an Andy Warhol piece, "Untitled (Gold Shoe)" sold for $205,000; and a second Warhol ink and watercolor, "Untitled (Floral Still Life)", for $145,000.

Counter automaton

In computer science, a counter automaton is a Pushdown automaton with only two symbols, "A" and the initial symbol in formula_1 (the finite set of stack symbols). This class of automata can recognize a subset of Context free languages, for instance the language:
formula_2
To accept the above language, let "x" be a word on the form above. The automaton can use the symbol A to count the number of "a"'s in "x" (writing an "A" for each "a" in "x") and deleting an "A" for each "b" in "x".

Abaco Independence Movement

In August 1973, shortly after the Bahamas became independent, the Abaco Independence Movement was formed as a political party whose stated aim was self-determination for the Abaco Islands within a federal Bahamas. In October 1973, AIM published a newsletter to launch its campaign for 'self-determination through legal and peaceful political action'. AIM proposed that all Crown land on Abaco would be placed in a land trust. Each citizen would receive a one acre home lot from the trust plus shares giving them an income from land sales and leases. The land trust would enter into a joint venture to develop a 60 sq mile free trade zone. When AIM was formed by Chuck Hall and Bert Williams, they contacted an American financier named Michael Oliver, who through his libertarian Phoenix Foundation agreed to support AIM financially. The Phoenix Foundation had previously sought to establish a libertarian enclave in the South Pacific, the Republic of Minerva. AIM's first convention, held on February 23 1974, was addressed by John Hospers, the Libertarian Party's 1972 US presidential candidate. Hospers was later refused entry to the Bahamas. The maverick British MP Colin Campbell Mitchell also visited Abaco to offer support.
Around May 1974, reports emerged of a group called the 20th Century Revolutionaries whose intention appeared to be the overthrow of central government on Abaco. AIM denounced the group.
In February 1975 an article appeared in Esquire magazine claiming plans for an insurrection in Abaco were underway. Mitchell WerBell, an American arms-dealer and mercenary, claimed that Abaco would declare unilaterial independence. It was claimed that WerBell was managing and financing AIM and had been recruiting mercenaries to go to Abaco. Although no arrests or charges were made relating to an insurrection, AIMs involvement with WerBell, which included vists to his Georgia estate greatly discredited AIM. In March 1975 AIM changed its name. 
The new Abaco Home Rule Movement denied any military objectives and published a draft constitution for a proposed Abaco Commonwealth, based on libertarian principles. The results of the 1977 general election, in which the Progressive Liberal Party won 30 seats of 38 seats in Parliament including Abaco-Coopers Town, was a major disappointment for AHRM and effectively marked the end of the movement. The AIM newspaper, The "Abaco Independent" ceased publication in 1977.
The AIM flag showed a lighthouse (presumably the lighthouse at Hopetown) amidst a sunburst.

Mercy Flights

Mercy Flights is a ground ambulance and air medical transport service based in Medford, Oregon.
Mercy Flights was founded as a non-profit organization in 1949 by George Milligan, an air traffic controller in Medford, after a friend of his died of polio in Southern Oregon, unable to survive the long, slow ground transport to Portland. 
Through fundraising efforts by schoolchildren, scouts, and others in the community, George Milligan raised enough money to buy the first aircraft, a twin engine Cessna, which was known as the bamboo bomber. A membership program was established which provided people in the community an opportunity to contribute to Mercy Flights, while insuring that they would be financially covered in the event that they needed air medical transportation. To date, Mercy Flights has flown more than 15,000 patients throughout the western United States. Mercy Flights' ground ambulance service currently serves more than 18,000 patients each year. Mercy Flights currently has two pressurized King Air C-90s. These powerful twin-engine turboprop airplanes are pressurized up to 30,000 feet.
In 1992, Mercy Flights purchased Medford Ambulance Service, expanding operations to include ground ambulance transportation. This acquisition combined the strengths of these two community service organizations, building on the varied background and experience of each. The decision to expand in this way followed discussions with both Rogue Valley Medical Center and Providence Hospital, which established the importance of building a regional medical transportation network. In 1993, Mercy Flights acquired Rogue Ambulance, expanding its service area to include the communities of White City, Eagle Point, and Shady Cove.
In the past, the outlying communities of Prospect and Butte Falls were served by all volunteer ambulance services, which were struggling with the financial difficulties of operating ambulances in the nineties. Through a cooperative effort, these first responders and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) continue to serve their communities, but now do so as a valuable part of the Mercy Flights organization. These communities benefit from the assurance of consistent, professional emergency medical services and a stronger economic base, and the EMTs benefit through increased training, improved equipment, and some financial compensation for the crucial role they play.
In 1995, Mercy Flights and Timberland entered a joint effort to provide an emergency helicopter service available to all citizens and agencies within a 150-mile radius of Medford, further expanding the type of medical transportation provided. This added resource allows rapid transport for critical patients, as well as improved access to remote areas. Mercy Flights operates a twin-engine Eurocopter BO-105. It’s fully customized with state-of-the-art in-flight medical equipment. This light, compact helicopter has four composite rotor blades to ensure maneuverability. All of its main systems (hydraulics, electric, fuel, lubrication) were designed to be fully redundant.
Mercy Flights sponsors an EMS specific Explorer post through the Learning for Life program of the Boy Scouts of America. Through this program, young people between the ages of 16 and 21 receive training and experience in EMS and are able to “explore” this as a career option. The young explorers are medically trained at a First Responder level and are used at large public events, scouting events, and disaster relief efforts such as the flooding problems experienced by Jackson County in January 1997.

Shuler served on the House committees on Agriculture (1994–2001), Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources (2002–2011), Corporations, Insurance and Banking (1994–2001), Education (2004–2011), Labor and Commerce (1994–1997), Militia, Police and Public Safety (2002–2011), Mining and Mineral Resources (1994–2001), and Science and Technology (1998–2001).
Early life, education.
Shuler was born in Rockingham County, Virginia. He received a B.S. degree from Virginia Tech in 1966 and a doctorate in veterinary medicine from the University of Georgia in 1970.
Electoral history.
Shuler served on the Blacksburg, Virginia town council 1982–1988.
In 1993, when Democrat Joan Munford retired from the House of Delegates 12th district seat after six terms, Shuler became the Democratic nominee, and won the seat.
The Republican majority substantially redrew the 12th district during the 2001 redistricting. The district, which had been based in Giles and Montgomery Counties, expanded northward to include all of Alleghany, Bath and Craig Counties, as well as the independent cities of Covington and Clifton Forge (which reverted to town status within Alleghany County in 2002); this put 18th district incumbent and fellow Democrat Creigh Deeds in the 12th with Shuler. Shuler moved from Blacksburg to Pulaski County and ran for the open 7th district seat, but lost to Republican Dave Nutter in the November 6, 2001 general election, while Deeds won in the redrawn 12th.
State Senator Emily Couric had died of pancreatic cancer on October 18, three weeks before the election, and Deeds won her seat in a special election on December 18. This created a vacancy in Shuler's old district, so he moved back to Blacksburg and won a 12th district special election on January 8, 2002. On the next day, when the House opened its new session, Shuler returned without an actual break in service.

Huyler's

Huyler's was a candy and restaurant chain in the New York City metropolitan area which was in business beginning in the 19th Century.
In 1883 their candy factory was located at Irving Place and 18th Street in Manhattan. The New York City Telephone Building occupied the opposite corner of 18th Street. The firm was on a list of businesses in a 1901 issue of the New York Times, which had been in existence for at least fifty years. The chain
was owned by John S. Huyler, a trustee of Syracuse University. He died in 1910 at the age of 65. 
A Southern United States syndicate purchased Huyler's in December 1925.
In 1929 Huyler's candy and ice cream shops were owned by David A. Schulte, head of Schulte Stores. He envisioned opening five hundred stores within five years, to be operated by Huyler's Luncheonettes Inc. The new subsidiary maintained its offices at 110 East 13th Street.
Company history.
John Huyler's father, David, had a bakery in Greenwich Village and the family lived above the shop. John Huyler's first business was a shop on Broadway near 18th Street. It sold ice cream and candy. He saved the profit from the endeavor and put it back in his business, opening his first store in 1874. A few years later he opened three more stores in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Albany.
The six-story building at Irving Place sustained $70,000 worth of damage caused by a fire on June 18, 1889. The conflagration burned three floors of the structure completely. Another fire broke out at Huyler's on the night of January 27, 1917, in a brick building separated from the main part of the candy factory. Firemen struggled for more
than an hour to control the blaze which gutted a portion of the plant. One source believed the fire began because of defective insulation wires.
The Irving Place site of Huyler's candy factory was acquired by a building syndicate in 1928. It planned to erect an apartment building in its
place.
Legacy.
Benjamin F. DeKlyn, an associate of John Huyler in the formation of the candy company, sold thirty shares of stock in Huyler's Inc., to Frank DeKlyn Huyler and Coulter D. Huyler, sons of the founder, in 1910, for $349,000. The other sons were John S. Huyler Jr., the youngest and David Huyler. The former died after his father before reaching the 
age of 21. In an accounting filed in a New York Surrogate Court on October 21, 1926, the trust fund left by John S. Huyler for his three sons
was found to have increased 100% over the previous thirteen years. Over the same period Huyler's widow, Mrs. Rosa F. Huyler Cooke, received
$390,000 from a $500,000 trust fund. She resided at 1 West 72nd Street, Manhattan.
The Huyler Building, built in Buffalo in 1926, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

Let's Just Do It

"Let's Just Do It" is a posthumous single by the American rapper, singer, and songwriter Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, and is the lead single from her first posthumous album, "Eye Legacy".
Background.
The song was originally recorded in 1998 for possible inclusion in the 1999 multi-platinum "FanMail". The song was not included with "FanMail" as it did not fit the album's sound, because the album focused on futuristic production.
When the idea for Eye Legacy was brought about, "Let's Just Do It" was selected to go on the album and was then chosen to be the lead single. In 2008, Missy Elliott recorded new vocals on the song, whilst the track was remixed and was given a new beat.
The track was first played November 5, 2008, at Hot Dance Airplay reporter WDRE/Nassau, New York.
The song samples "State of the World" by Janet Jackson without credit.
Reception.
Despite the low download sales of the single, "Let's Just Do It" received a very positive review from "Billboard" magazine. It says "The energy that made the trio's upbeat singles international smashes is evident here, along with Left Eye's essence—a reminder that TLC was among the most successful female R&B groups of all time. Originally recorded in 1998, the Heavy Weights and Marcus DL's production builds a catchy and contemporary rhythmic structure."
Chart performance.
The track sold less than 1,000 downloads during the week of the single's release, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Because of this, the song failed to chart in the US "Billboard" charts and failed to be released worldwide.

<doc id="20169861" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20169861" title="Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship">
Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship

The Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship is the foremost intercollegiate team chess championship in the Americas. Hosted in part by the United States Chess Federation, the Pan-Am Intercollegiate is open to any team comprising four players and up to two alternates from the same post-secondary school (university, college, community college) in North America, Central America, South America, or the Caribbean. The Pan-Am began as such in 1946 (there had been earlier versions open to U.S. schools only), and is held annually, usually December 27–30. It has been held in the United States for virtually all of its history; however, it was hosted in Canada four times (1969, 1971, 1984, 1999). The current format is a six-round fixed-roster team Swiss-system tournament scored by team (not individual) points. Sometimes the Pan-Am Intercollegiate is held as part of a larger event called the Pan-American Chess Championships comprising the Pan-Am Intercollegiate, Pan-Am Scholastic Team Championship, and Pan-Am Open (for any individual).
The 2013 Pan American Intercollegiate Chess Championship will take place December 27–30, at Texas Tech University.
Significance.
The winning team is considered to be the top college or university team in Pan-America. In the event of a tie, the title is shared among the top scoring teams.
The top four US schools advance to the President's Cup (informally known as the "Final Four of College Chess" and typically held in the first weekend of April), which determines the US National College or University Champion.
Rules.
The governing body for the Pan-Am is the College Chess Committee (CCC) of the United States Chess Federation (USCF). The CCC ratified a set of guidelines for the Pan-Am in 1992, which have been amended by various resolutions of the CCC, most recently in 2012. College chess does not fall under the authority of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Pan-Am is conducted under USCF rules and is rated both by USCF and FIDE.
The CCC adopted stricter eligibility requirements effective January 2004. Among other conditions, these rules require each player to be enrolled at least half-time in a degree-seeking program, have a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 (on a four-point score), play for at most six years, and for internationally titled players only, be under 26 years old as of September 1 of the year of competition. Previously, there were no age restrictions, and players were required only to be making progress in a degree-seeking program. Subsequently, the age limit for titled players was relaxed to under 30 years old for graduate students. In 2009, the CCC further relaxed the age limits for titled players by allowing them to play at any age provided they satisfied the following stricter academic requirements: are full-time students in a degree-seeking program, have a GPA of at least 3.0, and satisfy these conditions for at least one full semester. Drs. Tim Redman (UTD) and Alan Sherman (UMBC) led the effort to establish stricter eligibility rules in 2004.
Age limits have been the most contentious rules issue. The current requirements, which apply only to titled players, reflect a compromise. Some feel that it is improper and illegal to discriminate on the basis of age, and that eligibility should be defined solely in terms of academic considerations. Others feel that college competitions should be restricted to traditional college-age students, taking issue with players over thirty. Some people have criticized UMBC and other schools for having recruited older players.
For example, in 2002, the winning B team from UMBC was led by 31-year-old Dr. Alex Sherzer, who left the school before completing his degree in emergency health services.
Other players from UMBC included 44-year-old William Morrison, who played his eighth Pan Am, 27-year-old Alexander Onischuk, 40-year-old Alex Wojtkiewicz, and 30-year-old Battsetseg Tsagaan. But most UMBC players have been outstanding students—for example, Sergey Erenburg, a finalist for UMBC valedictorian, is now pursuing a PhD in financial economics at the University of Pennsylvania. Morrison, Onischuk, and Tsagaan graduated from UMBC. UMBC requires all students on chess scholarships to be full-time and to maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 (on a 4-point scale). Those who don't lose their scholarships, as happened to Wojtkiewicz.
The CCC Guidelines also include directives to chess program directors concerning the conduct of chess scholarships. For example, they are not to recruit players from others schools, and they are not to offer scholarships to anyone they feel will not graduate.
At the 2012 Pan-Am, the CCC recommended that all cash prizes at the Pan-Am Intercollegiate be eliminated and forbidden.
For many years prior to 1996, high school teams were allowed to compete in the Pan-Am Intercollegiate, though few did.
History.
Started in 1946, the Pan-Am has been held under various names and formats. For some years in the period 1945-1974 there was an individual college championship. Following Bobby Fischer's victory at the 1972 World Championship, the popularity of the Pan-Am temporarily soared. Beginning in the 1990s, the Pan-Am has been dominated by powerhouse teams from schools offering major chess scholarships, particularly Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC), University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), and University of Texas at Dallas (UTD).
Early years.
The Pan-Am started in 1946, although there had been a team event for American schools only before World War II. One noteworthy result from this earlier event, from 1931–32, had City College of New York winning, with Reuben Fine on board one and Sidney Norman Bernstein on board two; the team scored 31.5 out of a possible 32 points.
From 1946 to 1964, the Pan-Am Intercollegiate Team Championship was held every even year, with a Pan-Am Intercollegiate Individual Championship held every odd year from 1945 to 1965.
American schools from the northeast and midwest regions dominated both the hosting and winning of the championship. Columbia University won three titles, the University of Chicago won two, and CCNY won two during this period. The first eight tournaments averaged about a dozen teams taking part. From 1962 to 1967, participation doubled to an average of about 25 teams per year.
Annual competition begins.
With increased interest, annual team competition began in 1964. The next year also saw the first non-American winner, the University of Toronto. The first non-American school to host was Canada's McGill University at Montreal in 1969, and McGill also won the event that year. From 1968 to 1971, interest doubled again, to nearly 50 teams per year.
From 1965 to 1974, the Pan-Am Individual Championship also took place.
The Fischer boom.
With Bobby Fischer mounting a successful run to the World Chess Championship during the years 1970 to 1972, chess interest in the United States boomed to all-time highs. This was reflected in the highest participation levels in the history of the Pan-Am, with an average of nearly 108 teams per year from 1972 to 1978; the top turnout was 123 teams (520 players) in 1975. Future Grandmasters Larry Christiansen and Ron Henley (both recruited with chess scholarships) anchored the 1976 championship team from the University of South Florida, the first southern school to win.
Three straight titles.
The University of Toronto was the first school to win three straight outright titles, from 1980 to 1982; this feat was repeated by Harvard University from 1988-90. Rhode Island College, which adopted chess scholarships to attract top players coming out from high schools, lead by former US High School Chess Champions James Thibault and Sandeep Joshi rolled to a convincing victory in 1985. The 1983 Champion team from Yale University featured 3 future US Chess Champions in Joel Benjamin, Michael Wilder, and Inna Izrailov.
From 1979 to 1986, an average of 57 teams took part. Future US Chess Champion Grandmaster Patrick Wolff led Yale University to victory in 1987. Harvard University enjoyed a very successful streak from 1986 to 1990 with four titles in five years, either won outright or shared.
Prior to 1986 the Pan Ams were organizated by the Intercollegiate League of America (ICLA), which ran the tournaments with vigor. The United States Chess Federation took over the organization after the 1986 Pan-Am in Providence, Rhode Island. After the USCF took over, organizational standards dropped, and this was followed by a gradual decline in the number of teams competing. One huge issue was the use of scholarship players. When South Florida, RI College and Yale offered scholarships to players, the players were legitimate college students just graduated from high school. However, the USCF made no effort to control colleges enrolling many very strong players in their 30s and even 40s, for the main purpose of winning the tournament. In chess, players can reach their peak in their 30s or later. A few colleges loaded up their teams with many older European GMs and IMs. Many other schools, figuring that they had absolutely no chance of completing, and feeling cheated, no longer showed up for the tournament. The attendance record clearly reflects this problem. However, recent rule changes have addressed this issue.
Kamsky plays in Pan-Am but Vivek Rao shines.
Chicago 1991 saw a reigning U.S. champion appear in the Pan-Am for the first time, when 17-year-old Soviet emigre Gata Kamsky, one of the world's top players, was top board for Brooklyn College. Kamsky lost a sensational game to Vivek Rao from the winning University of Illinois team. Vivek Rao was not only sensational in the 1991 Pan-Am. He was also sensational in leading Harvard in winning the 1988, 1989 and 1990 Pan Ams.
Chess scholarships, the rise of powerhouse schools.
The 1990s saw two important events that influenced college chess: the fall of the Iron Curtain sent a flood of very strong eastern European and former Soviet players to the Americas, and several schools began offering major chess scholarships.
The University of South Florida offered chess scholarships in 1976 to two outstanding young players, but soon abandoned the experiment after winning the 1976 Pan-Am. Subsequently, Rhode Island College offered chess scholarships to top players coming out from high school, and they eventually won the Pan-Am in 1985. Howard Prince at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) recruited grandmasters and eventually offered major chess scholarships. BMCC won the Pan-Am in 1993, 1994, and 1997. Alan Sherman at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) convinced the administration to offer major chess scholarships to outstanding chess-player scholars. Through chess scholarships, vision, and determination, UMBC built a chess dynasty that has won (or tied for first place) at the Pan-Am in 1996, 1998–2002, 2005, 2008-2009, 2012. Following UMBC's success, Tim Redman at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) built a rival chess dynasty with chess scholarships. UTD won (or tied for first place) at the Pan-Am in 2000-2001, 2003–2004, 2006–2008, 2010-2012.
In 2009, two more Texas schools fielded strong teams: University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) and Texas Tech University; both offered major chess scholarships. The 2010 Final Four was the strongest to date: it featured UMBC (average USCF rating 2559), UTD (2574), UTB (2598), and Texas Tech (2429).
In 2012, with major private donors, Webster University and Lindenwood have emerged as new powerhouses.
The 2012 Pan-Am was the strongest ever: the 44 teams included 23 grandmasters and five schools with average USCF ratings over 2500; Webster's A and B teams were initially ranked 1 and 3.
A commonality among many of the schools with strong chess programs is the presence of an active faculty advisor with a passion for chess: for example, 
Howard Prince at BMCC, Alan Sherman at UMBC, Tim Redman at UTD, and Hal Karlsson at Texas Tech. Whereas students come and go, faculty advisors can provide
valuable continuity and sometimes they can negotiate more effectively than can students with school administrators.
Records.
As of 2012, UMBC and UTD share the record for most wins: each has won (or tied for first place) at the Pan-Am ten times.
Also, UMBC also has the record for the longest winning streak: five-year 1998-2002,
and the most wins at the Final Four: six times (2003–2006, 2009-2010).

Two Tongues

Two Tongues is an indie rock side project/supergroup consisting of members of Say Anything (Max Bemis and Coby Linder) and Saves The Day (Chris Conley), along with David Soloway, a former guitarist with Saves the Day.
History.
Before forming Two Tongues, Bemis, Conley and Linder had collaborated on a cover version of Bob Dylan's "The Man In Me" for the compilation album "Paupers, Peasants, Princes & Kings: The Songs of Bob Dylan", released by Doghouse Records in 2006. Bemis asked Conley about potentially doing an album together; Conley responded positively by saying "I would do it with no one else, nothing could be more epic!"
The resulting album, "Two Tongues", was scheduled to be released in summer 2008, but was delayed for unspecified reasons. The album was eventually released on February 3, 2009, through Vagrant Records. The thirteen-track album was self-produced and recorded at Electric Ladybug studios in Durham, California.
Shows/performances.
In fall 2010, Two Tongues made their first performances as a surprise in the middle of Say Anything's set each night of the Motion City Soundtrack, Say Anything and Saves the Day tour. They performed the song "Crawl". Arun Bali (current guitarist of Saves the Day) played guitar, Kenny Vasoli (of The Starting Line and Person L) played bass guitar, Jake Turner (of Say Anything) played guitar, Coby Linder played drums and Conley and Bemis sang.
Conley confirmed that there would be a second Two Tongues album in 2012, however no albums were released.
Bemis stated in 2013 that a new Two Tongues and a new painful splits record is on the way, however with the departure of Coby Linder from Say Anything, some have speculated that Two Tongues has disbanded.

<doc id="20169913" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20169913" title="Prussian T 14">
Prussian T 14

The Prussian T 14s were German, 2-8-2T, goods train, tank locomotives operated by the Prussian state railways and the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine. They were later incorporated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn into their renumbering plan as Class 93.0–4.
These locomotives were intended for goods traffic and Sunday excursion services on the lines of the Berlin Stadtbahn. Later the T 14 was also procured by other railway divisions for goods trains on main lines and even for passenger services. In all, 457 of this class was built for the Prussian state railways and 40 for the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine between 1914 and 1918.
Due to uneven weight distribution the axle load on the leading wheels was 169.7 kN higher than that of the driving wheels.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over 400 T 14s from Prussia and six from the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine as 93 001–406. The T 14s from Alsace-Lorraine were given numbers 93 094, 188–191 and 237. In 1927 two more T 14s were acquired from the Farge-Vegesack Railway and numbered as 93 407 and 408; and in 1935 locomotives 93 409–417 from the Saar Railway were added. In World War II several T 14s came from Poland and Belgium into the DRB fleet as 93 418 - 450. After the Second World War the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) incorporated further T 14s, which came from France and Belgium, as 93 451–459.
The Deutsche Bundesbahn began retiring them in 1960. In the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn the last ones were even given new computerised numbers in 1970 and classified as DR Class 93.8. The last T 14 there retired in 1971.
After the Second World War locomotives 93 058, 324 and 405 were left in Austria. As a result, the araus bildete die Austrian Federal Railway (ÖBB) formed them into their ÖBB Class 693 retaining their serial numbers. Number 693.058 was retired as early as 1953, the other two engines remained in the ÖBB fleet until 1958.
Locomotive 93 230 has been preserved and belongs to the Dresden Transport Museum. Another unit, PKP Class TKt1, is preserved in Poland at Chabówka railroad museum.

List of Victoria Cross recipients of the Royal Air Force

The Victoria Cross (VC) is a military decoration awarded for valour "in the face of the enemy" to members of armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. It takes precedence over all other postnominals and medals. It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and civilians under military command, and is presented to the recipient by the British monarch during an investiture held at Buckingham Palace. It is the joint highest award for bravery in the United Kingdom with the George Cross, which is the equivalent honour for valour not "in the face of the enemy". The VC has been awarded on 1356 occasions to 1353 individual recipients. 
The ribbon is crimson, 38 mm (1.5 inches) wide. The original (1856) specification for the award stated that the ribbon should be red for army recipients and blue for naval ones. However the dark blue ribbon was abolished soon after the formation of the Royal Air Force on 1 April 1918. On 22 May 1920 King George V signed a warrant that stated all recipients would now receive a red ribbon and the living recipients of the naval version were required to exchange their ribbons for the new colour.
There have been a total of 26 recipients of the VC who were serving in the Royal Air Force, including the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, at the time of their valiant deed or deeds. First World War VCs awarded to airmen in the Royal Flying Corps (13 in total) and the Royal Naval Air Service (2 in total) are not listed below. The vast majority of air force VCs awarded in a single conflict were for the Second World War. Second World War dominion air force personnel under RAF command are not listed below. Their tally is as follows: Royal New Zealand Air Force (3 awards), Royal Australian Air Force (2 awards), Royal Canadian Air Force (2 awards), South African Air Force (1 award). Additionally, two Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm airmen won the VC during the Second World War, one of whom was attached from the Royal Canadian Navy. 
All of the 26 men who won the VC while serving in the RAF were aircrew. Although no RAF ground branch officers or tradesmen have ever won the VC while serving in the RAF, Group Captain F H Kirby, who was an RAF equipment officer, won the VC for his actions during the Second Boer War when he was a corporal in the Royal Engineers. No RAF personnel have been awarded the VC since the end of the Second World War.

Columbia Park, Torrance, California

Columbia Park (formally Columbia Regional Park) is a recreational urban regional park in the City of Torrance, located in southern Los Angeles County, California. Columbia Park provides the community with soccer fields, baseball diamonds, a roller hockey rink, community gardening beds, walking paths, and a jogging—competitive cross country running trail. It is one of thirty parks in the Torrance Parks system.
Park features.
Recreation and sports.
Columbia Park includes six soccer fields, two baseball diamonds, and a roller hockey rink. 
The park also includes a walking path which is divided by a fence line to the east of the main soccer field into a west section and a 0.57-mile (0.92 km) east section. In addition, the park has a jog path that serves as a flat, exercise trail and competitive cross country running racecourse. The heavily used soccer fields include lights for night play.
Community gardening.
Columbia Park features a Community Garden providing planting beds and 'community' for residents. It is one of twelve county-operated Smart Gardening Centers around the region. Columbia Park additionally serves as home to the Home Garden Learning Center, and is a backyard composting demonstration center provided by Los Angeles County.
History.
Columbia Park was conceived in 1970 and built in 1983. In 1985, the park's designer, Paul Saito, received an achievement award for the design and installation of Columbia Park.
Phase one.
Columbia Park first was conceived by former Torrance City manager Edward J. Ferraro. In 1970, Ferraro acquired of U.S. Navy surplus property for $250,000 to build Torrance's Wilson Park. At about the same time, Ferraro put a plan together to acquire approximately of land in North Torrance to build 'Columbia Regional Park'. By December 1973, the Torrance City Council took a step closer to acquiring land for both Columbia Park and also for Madrona Marsh Preserve, protecting the last vernal marsh and wetlands remaining in the South Bay area of Los Angeles. In 1975 the state of California agreed to provide funds for the development of Columbia Park.
The park, located adjacent to an ExxonMobil oil refinery, includes a radio antenna that services the Los Angeles all-news radio station KNX (AM). There are also -high electrical line towers, each of which supports 220,000-volt electrical lines maintained by electricity supply company Southern California Edison. 
Columbia Park was opened in 1983 as a Torrance recreational regional park with large grassy expanses.
Sculptures.
In 1983 Standard Brands Paint Company in Torrance donated a sculpture by public works artist Roger Berry to the park. The sculpture, entitled "Fujimihara", presently resides in the southwest corner of Columbia Park.
Women's soccer.
In the late 1980s, Columbia Park became the home field to the Manhattan Beach club women's soccer team 'Ajax America Women.' On Sundays at Columbia Park, Ajax and the other women's teams played as many as 16 games on four fields from September to April. U.S. woman's soccer standouts, defender Joy Biefeld-Fawcett and forward Carin Jennings, were members of 'Ajax America Women' and regularly practiced and played at the Columbia Park's soccer fields. These two Columbia park players would go on in 1991 to help 'Ajax' win the U.S. women's amateur championship, and then help the U.S. national team win the first FIFA Women's World Cup in China that same year. U.S. woman's soccer standouts, defender Joy Biefeld-Fawcett and forward Carin Jennings, routinely practiced and played in the soccer fields at Columbia Park in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Redesign - walks and trails.
When Columbia Park first was designed and planned, the design supported soccer and other field sports, but didn't serve the needs of walkers and joggers, the present day walkways and trails were not part of the original park. In 1984 Landscape designer Paul Saito returned, to redesign Columbia Park to include walking paths and running trails, adding exercise challenges and aesthetic enjoyment. After receiving of San Diego, California, Saito had the park laid out according to his plan, with enjoyable concrete pathways winding around the hilly landscape. The park has, with sponsorship by Hydro-Scape Products Inc., around 100 distinct automated and water conserving sprinkler stations-zones to irrigate the . The California Landscape Contractors Association awarded Paul Saito the 1985 Achievement Award, for his creativity in the completed project.
Phase two - southwest.
To enlarge Columbia Park, in 1985 the city council awarded Terra-Cal Construction a $173,655 contract for construction of the southwest portion of the park, expanding public access and amenities, and community green-space.
Phase three.
In 2000, plans were made to increase the number of parking spaces serving the park users. In addition, the plans included attractive gazebos, which are located near 190th Street park area.
In 2004, the Columbia Park parking lot at the southwest corner of 190th Street and Prairie Avenue was used by Chevrolet as a filming location for their television commercial.
Tree dedications - urban forest.
On April 22, 1995, a tree was planted in Columbia Park by The Friends of Madrona Marsh to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Earth Day.
Cherry blossom trees.
During the summer of 2001, the Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International USA donated the cost of 100 Cherry blossom trees to the city of Torrance as part of Torrance's Living Tree Dedication program that began in 1993. The plan for the program was to plant 10 cherry trees at Columbia Park as part of a ceremony each year for ten years beginning in 2001. This donation in particular was part of Sōka Gakkai's campaign to plant trees in cities across the nation as a way to "create a peaceful environment" in society and better the communities they live in. In August 2001, ten of those cherry trees were planted at Columbia Park. By April 2007, seventy cherry trees had been planted in Columbia Park. In November of that year, Soka Gakkai International USA increased its donation from ten to thirty cherry trees per year.
Living Tribute Trees program.
The Torrance Living Dedication Tree Program is coordinated and by the City, so that families, individuals, and groups can sponsor the planting of a new tree in the park to honor a person or commemorate an event with a living tribute Tree Dedication.
Park challenges.
Sail-Skating.
The long, winding cement walk pathways and usually vacant parking lots of Columbia Park quickly became a popular place for skate sailing in the mid-1980s. In the summer of 1985, a sail skater was clocked by a police radar gun doing 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) inside the park. Near the end of 1985, the Torrance City Council had enough and unanimously approved an ordinance that made it illegal to ride a "wheeled conveyance" equipped with sails on city streets, in parks or on other public property.
Gophers.
The grassy expanse of the newly developed Columbia Park turned out to be an ideal habitat for gophers and quickly attracted and maintained a gopher population of more than 600 animals. The gopher holes made it impossible to use the fields to play sports. The gopher population was so large that an "exceptionally sized" hawk could perch on the top of the KNX antenna and repeatedly swoop down, snatch a gopher, and fly back to the top of the antenna to consume. Other animals also survived on the gophers.
In 1987, the city assigned Hank "G-Man" Baranowski to the park to address the gopher problem. At that time, Baranowski was known as 'G-Man' due to his ability to "wipe out gopher populations" and his reputation as the city's "premier gopher grabber." Within a few months, Baranowski had eliminated the gopher population in Columbia Park. With the gopher problem resolved, the recreation fields at Columbia Park began to receive regular use.
Safety concerns.
People.
In May 1993, a fight broke out among members of two gangs in Columbia Park. One of the gang members fired a gun that hit a bystander. However, a necklace worn by the woman stopped the bullet from completely penetrating her chest. As a result of the shooting, a neighborhood association's lobbying the city for park improvements, and homeowner complaints about "non-residents" using the basketball court and causing trouble. Torrance officials sought to improve security and took the unusual step of closing the park's basketball court by removing the basketball rims and padlocking the entry to the court.
Floods.
Plans were created in 2001 to realign portions of the Columbia Park jogging path that were in lower areas or overlapped by sprinklers, to prevent flooded and slippery paths. The city added decomposed granite as part of fixing the problem, by draining water off the new raised sections.
Play equipment.
In 2003, the Firetruck used as play equipment at Columbia Park was determined to not meet the Federal Safety Guidelines for preventing head and hand entrapment, and protecting children from falling off the vehicle. In response to concerns about children playing on the firetruck it was fenced off. Three years later in January 2006 both the firetruck and fencing were removed, with plans to replacement with "neat, fun, and attractive play equipment with rubberized matting."
Dogs.
In 2006 Torrance considered possible sites, at both the city's Columbia Park and Wilson Park, for fenced-in dog parks, with two leash-free roaming sections separating large dogs from small dogs. In 2007, the city's Open Space Committee met to discuss the feasibility of adding city dog parks. Later in 2007 the Committee had determined the only area large enough to accommodate a divided area for both large and small dogs was the Southern California Edison easement at Columbia Park. The plan required Southern California Edison needed to approve the proposal, and start-up costs of at least $50,000.<br> 
In presenting the proposal to the Torrance City Council one month later, the Open Space Committee stated: "a dog park in Torrance is not an essential element of our park system due to a lack of unused open space and the absence of a grassroots community group supporting this type of park." At that same meeting, the Dog Obedience Club of Torrance asserted that a Torrance Dog Park could bring potential liability to the city through dog fights, dog caused injuries, and spread of diseases and that the money would be better spent on the city's animal shelters. By a voice vote, the city council agreed that a dog park was not an essential element of Torrance's city park system.
Reservations and events.
Columbia Park and the 29 other Torrance city parks were deemed busy enough satisfying the citizens pleasure and recreation needs. Reservations are available from the Community Services: Parks Department, and needed for group picnic areas, organized sports fields, and larger special group events in the park and its facilities.

Austrian Air Force (1927–1938)

The Austrian Air Force ("Österreichische Luftstreitkräfte") of the interwar period began as a paramilitary organisation (1927) and was secretly built up by the government before union with Germany (1938).
History.
In 1919 the peace treaty meant the Republic of Austria was forbidden to operate military aircraft. 
In 1927 the paramilitary Heimwehr organisation set up an air corps using Austrian, British and Italian aircraft (dissolved after the Anschluss in 1938). Its emblem was a red-white-red flag, with a white eagle on a green circle at its centre.
In 1928 the Bundesheer (federal army) began secretly training pilots. In further consequence a technical infrastructure was created and aircraft ordered from Italy. In August 1933 the first military aeroplanes ordered by the republic (five Fiat CR.20 biplanes) were supplied. The Bundesheer began secretly equipping flying clubs in Vienna-Aspern and Graz-Thalerhof with Italian-built aircraft (Fiat Ansaldo and Caproni).
In 1936, flight engineer Rosner from the Graz-Thalerhof base won the competition for designing a new national emblem, which was introduced in the same year. The white, equilateral triangle with the point facing downwards in a red disc was a completely new design and had (other than the flag or coats of arms) no prior basis.
The airmens' barracks at Aspern were the only new barracks built in Vienna between the wars. The Austrian government planned the establishment of an air base at Tullnerfeld, however this plan was realised only by the German armed forces (nowadays: Brumowski Air base, near Langenlebarn). The uniform departed from all traditions and followed the international model: Grey jacket with four buttons as well as rocker emblem on the chest, and soft garrison caps more reminiscent of British models.

Of the 45 Fiat CR.32 originally procured, 36 were still in service in 1938 and after the Anschluss were handed over by Germany to their Hungarian allies.
The CR20 and CR32 were in their time very modern combat aircraft, however were obsolete by 1938. Their type designation "CR" stood for "Caccia" (Italian: "Hunt") and the name of the technical designer Rosatelli. "A" in the type designation Fiat A120 stands for the aircraft section of the Ansaldo company, taken over by Fiat in 1926.

"The Seed (2.0)" is the second single by The Roots from their fifth album "Phrenology" (2002). The track, which features Cody Chesnutt on the guitar and vocals, is an "uptempo retooling" of his song "The Seed" from the album "The Headphone Masterpiece". The song's music video was nominated for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Jeff Vrabel of "Billboard" described the track as "a genre-bending mix of rock guitars and Prince-styled keyboards and drums".
Music and reception.
"The Seed (2.0)" is a hybrid mix of "distorted rock, hip-hop and psychedelic soul". Brett Berliner of "Stylus Magazine" called the track "a rock song, featuring a little bit of funk and just a very little bit of hip-hop." The song was favorably received from music critics. Robert Christgau called it the album's "centerpiece" and "jammingest avant rap track". Pitchfork Media editor Sam Chennault described the song as an "orgiastic garage funk number" and called it the album's "most immediately satisfying track". In 2009, Pitchfork Media listed it at number 330 in "The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s". "Stylus Magazine"s Brett Berliner declared it the album's "best track" with its "catchy hook that stays with listeners for days". In "The A.V.

Spin Star

Spin Star was a British television game show that was broadcast on ITV, and was hosted by Bradley Walsh. It was based around a five-reel slot machine called the Moneyspinner. The reels displayed question subjects, the names of the five contestants who will answer the questions, and cash amounts that are won if the questions are answered correctly.
The five contestants do not win the money for themselves however; instead, they are winning it for the Spin Star, the contestant who has been there the longest. Therefore, each contestant will be on the show for six episodes, five answering questions for someone else, then one where they are in charge of the Moneyspinner.
The first reel has a range of categories of questions on it, each given a star rating of up to three stars. One star means the questions are of easy difficulty, two stars mean the questions are of medium difficulty and three stars mean the questions are of hard difficulty. After a category has been used, it is replaced by a new category, with any unused categories from a previous show being re-used.
The second, third and fourth reels have the names of the five daily players on them. These reels decide who will answer the questions.
The fifth reel has a range of cash values on it which increase with each spin. This determines how much money will be added to each players' totals for correct answers.
In the first round, the Spin Star has 3 Speed Spins. Each daily player is given £500 to start off with and the Speed Spins allow the daily players to attempt to win more money for the final round. The maximum amounts that can be won for these spins are £2,000 for the first spin, £3,000 for the second spin and £4,000 for the third spin.
The second round introduces two penalty spaces on the category and money reels. On the category reel, are two Brain Buster spaces. If one lands on the category reel, the questions that are asked are the most difficult questions that could be found. On the money reel are two Bank Buster spaces. If one lands on the money reel, if any player gets their question wrong, they lose all the money they have accumulated so far. In this second round, the Spin Star gets 3 more spins and if the Spin Star does not like the way the reels have landed, then they can elect to respin, however, they cannot respin the category or money reels if they land on a Brain or Bank Buster on them. Also, they cannot respin one reel on its own, it must be two or more. In either round, if the three middle reels have the same player name on the win line (for example: Sital, Sital, Sital), it is classed as a Jackpot line and the value of each question is doubled. The maximum amounts that can be won for these spins are £5,000 for the first spin, £7,500 for the second spin and £10,000 for the third spin.
In the final round, the values that the daily players have accumulated are put onto the three middle reels of the Moneyspinner (twice on each reel). Also, one Bank Buster is placed on the first reel, two on the second and three on the third. The Spin Star spins the category reel (respinning if it is not a desired category, but only once). The Spin Star is asked a question on each reel. If the answer is right, a Bank Buster is taken away, and if wrong, one is added. After each question is asked, the reel is spun and whatever amount lands on the win line is added to the Spin Star's total. If a Bank Buster comes up on any reel, the total is wiped out, but the Spin Star can carry on playing if a Bank Buster appears on reels one or two. It is possible for the same player's total to appear more than once, so, if one player accumulated £6,500 and it came up three times, the total would be £19,500 (£6,500 + £6,500 + £6,500). The maximum winnings any player could ever win was £567,000 but the odds of this happening are incredibly rare.

Description.
The text is written in 8 lines and 18 letters per line.
Caspar René Gregory classified manuscripts of New Testament into four groups: Papyri, Uncials, Minuscules, and Lectionaries. Talisman included into Uncials, it received number 0152. Eberhard Nestle distinguished new group – Talismans, and to this group included Uncial 0152. It received no. 1. This opinion was supported by other scholars, f.e. Kurt Aland, and in result "Uncial 0152" (or "Talisman 1") was deleted from the list of New Testament uncials, and now we have empty place in position 152 of the list.

Nephrolepis obliterata (Kimberly queen fern) is a species of fern in the family Lomariopsidaceae. This fern originated in Australia, but is relatively easy cultivate indoors worldwide.
The Kimberly queen is not as well known as the Boston fern. Because it is not as sensitive to a lack of humidity, it is better suited for the typical indoor environment.
Cultivation.
"Nephrolepis obliterata" prefer bright, but indirect sunlight. Temperatures between 60 °F and 75 °F are best. "Nephrolepis obliterata" is sensitive to both too little and too much water, so water the plant well but permit the soil to dry out between waterings. 
"Nephrolepis obliterata" has the added benefit of reducing indoor air pollution, particularly formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene.

Cro-Mag Rally

Cro-Mag Rally is a third-person racing/arcade game made by Pangea Software, which takes place in caveman times. It is available for Mac OS Classic, Mac OS X, iOS, and Windows Phone 7.
Gameplay.
The game centers around two cavemen racers, Brog and Grag in vehicles made out of materials associated with cavemen, as they race through different stages of ancient history. There are many different weapons available to defend yourself and help you win the race. The Mac version utilizes the keyboard to control, and the iOS version uses the accelerometer and touchscreen to control.
Single-player mode.
In single-player mode, one player races against five computer controlled racers through each of the nine racetracks, collecting arrowheads scattered around the track. At the beginning of the mode, only a few vehicles are available. However, as you progress through the mode, all eleven vehicles can be unlocked.
Multiplayer mode.
Cro-Mag Rally has multiple different multiplayer games. On the Mac version, you can race with up to two people on the same computer with any vehicle on any track. A number of other modes are available as well, such as tag, survival, and capture the flag. This iOS version offers Tag and Capture the flag multiplayer via Game Center
Powerups.
The game includes at total of 12 powerups, some of which are only available on certain tracks or modes.
Physics editor.
In the Mac version of the game, there is a "Physics Editor" choice under "Options" which allows the player to alter elements of play such as speed, acceleration, suspension, and traction of each car, as well as gravity, though the Atlantis level is unaffected. This is an easy way to cheat, as one can set the other players' cars to a ridiculously high speed (i.e. 995) and they will thus be unable to make much, if any, progress while the player may set their own speed to a more reasonable number (such as 15) and complete all required laps and/or arrowhead collection.
Glitches.
In the Mac version, there is a space outside the track where blackness makes up the bottom of the world, with a circle of black at the top and the background folded around it. One can drive on the blackness as though it were solid ground, and dust or steam appears when the player brakes. Occasionally the player may have difficulty maintaining control of his or her vehicle, and it may additionally take a long time for the brakes to kick in if applied.
There does not appear to be a limit to the space outside the track, and the triangle that marks the position of the player on the track will travel outside the boundary, traveling instead across the rest of the screen.
If somehow one makes it to the darkness in the Quest for Fire, one can take fire outside of the track and leave it places as though it were left on solid ground. Additionally, players may use items here, though Roman Candles will likely hit the player if they are fired, due to the lack of close proximity to any other players.
It is possible to glitch out of any map when you come to one of the many 2D walls that appear on almost all maps. To get out drive up to the wall and turn right and left repeatedly until you start slowly moving into the wall. This can also be performed in the first Bugdom game.
The Great Wall.
In the Great Wall, towards the very end of the track, there is a spot left wide open where the fence shifts from wooden back to stone with flags. This spot is able to be driven through to the outside of the track.
Crete.
In Crete, the first column on the right after the starting arch—the one ending the fence and beginning the hills—is able to be driven around to the outside of the track much like in the Great Wall. If one drives to the "ocean" part of the track, the ships are solid and the water, though it seems a level above the player, is able to be driven into (though they will hit an invisible barrier, preventing their easy access to and from the glitchy world). The statues are unable to hit the player, but there are pits along the outside that are difficult to get out of once fallen into.
The Viking Village.
In the Viking Village, there is a place maybe three-quarters of the way along the track that is between a rock and an invisible wall where one can escape into the darkness similar to the Great Wall and Crete (though far less interesting once achieved, and far more difficult to do).

<doc id="20170478" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20170478" title="Sesheshet">
Sesheshet

Sesheshet, occasionally known as Sesh, was the mother of King Teti, the first and founding pharaoh of the sixth dynasty of Ancient Egypt. She was instrumental in enabling her son to gain the throne and reconciling two warring factions of the royal family.
In 2008 archeologists discovered what is believed to have been her pyramid.
Family.
Sesheshet was a grandmother of King Pepi I Meryre. Queen Iput I, Teti's wife, was a daughter of King Unas, the last king of the Fifth dynasty. The dynasty that arose from Teti is considered part of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, a term designated by modern historians.
There was no break in the royal lines or the location of the capital from its predecessors, but significant cultural changes occurred to prompt the designation of different periods by scholars.
Until the recent rediscovery of her pyramid, little contemporary evidence about Sesheshet had been found. Her estates under the title "King's Mother" are mentioned in the tomb of the early sixth dynasty Vizier Mehi, and she is referenced in passing as the mother of Teti in a remedy for baldness in the Ebers Papyrus.
Teti named his daughters after his mother.
Pyramid discovery.
On November 8, 2008, Egypt's chief archaeologist, Zahi Hawass, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA), announced that Sesheshet was entombed in a 4,300-year-old, topless pyramid at Saqqara that measures tall. Hawass stated that this may be Saqqara's most complete subsidiary pyramid. The tomb numbers 118 among the ancient pyramids discovered so far in Egypt. The largest part of its wide casing was built with a superstructure high.
Hawass's archaeological team began excavating the site in 2006. The discovery of the pyramid was made in September 2008 with the unearthing of the structure from the sand. The structure originally reached in height, with sides long.
Once five stories tall, the pyramid was discovered beneath of sand, a small shrine, and mud-brick walls from later periods. It is the third known "subsidiary" pyramid to Teti's tomb and originally was and at its base, due to its walls having stood at a 51-degree angle. Buried next to the Saqqara Step pyramid, its base lies nineteen metres underground.
The pyramid of Sesheshet lies near two other pyramids which belong to Unas's two wives, Nebet and Khenut. Archeologists entered the pyramid on January 8, 2009. The remains of what are thought to be Sesheshet were found in the sarcophagus of the tomb. The mummy was found wrapped in cloth in the 22-metre long and four-metre wide chamber. Even though the archaeologists didn’t find the name of the queen in hieroglyphics, there is evidence to suggest that the mummy was the mother of the Sixth Dynasty ruler Teti, Hawass said in the statement. "It is believed that these remains belong to Queen Sesheshet, especially because the pyramid was not built for worship but it was a burial pyramid," he said. Hawass also stated that the sarcophagus appeared to have been looted. Ancient robbers had stolen most of the valuables from inside the sarcophagus, leaving behind the body parts, some pottery and gold that was used to cover fingers of royal pharaohs.
Although ancient graphics in good condition adorn the structure, it is presumed that the tomb was robbed of its valuable artifacts centuries ago.

The Global Dow

The Global Dow (GDOW) is a 150-stock index of corporations from around the world, created by Dow Jones & Company. Only blue-chip stocks are included in the index.
Like its famous progenitor, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU), stocks in The Global Dow are selected by senior editors of The Wall Street Journal. Joining them for this new index were Dow Jones Newswires senior editors in the three major regions of the globe. But unlike the Dow everyone is familiar with, The Global Dow is much bigger—150 stocks rather than 30—and its components are weighted equally rather than by price. All 30 Dow industrial stocks are included in The Global Dow, as well as some from the Dow Jones Transportation and Utility averages.
The biggest difference, however, is in concept and purpose. The Global Dow tracks leading companies from around the world in all industries, selected not just for current size and reputation but also for their potential.
The Global Dow covers both developed and emerging markets, recognizing that far-flung areas of the world are becoming more closely linked and more interdependent, and that wealth creation is no longer concentrated in a few countries. In addition, it includes companies from emerging sectors, such as alternative energy. 
The components of The Global Dow are equally weighted. This means that price movements of the larger stocks have no greater impact on index performance that those of the smaller stocks.
The Global Dow is calculated and disseminated in real time by Dow Jones Indexes. Current and closing values can be accessed through a variety of media, including daily in The Wall Street Journal, and real time at www.djindexes.com. The Base Value is 1000 as of December 31, 2000.

Temperance fountain

A temperance fountain was a fountain that was set up, usually by a private benefactor, to encourage people not to drink beer by the provision of safe and free water. Beer was the main alternative to water, and generally safer. The temperance societies had no real alternative as tea and coffee were too expensive, so drinking fountains were very attractive.
Temperance fountains in the United States.
Muddied and ill-tasting drinking water encouraged many Americans to drink alcohol for health purposes, so temperance groups constructed public drinking fountains throughout the United States following the Civil War. The National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (NWCTU)'s organizing convention of 1874 strongly encouraged its attendees to erect the fountains in the places that they had come from. The NWCTU advocated public temperance fountains as a means to discourage people from entering drinking establishment for refreshment.
Cast-stone statues of Hebe were marketed for use in temperance fountains. In New York City, the James Fountain in Tompkins Square is a Temperance fountain with the figure of Charity who empties her jug of water, aided by a child; it was donated by Daniel Willis James and sculpted by Adolf Donndorf. In Washington DC "the" Temperance Fountain was donated to the city in 1882 by Temperance crusader Henry D. Cogswell. This fountain was one of a series of fountains he designed and commissioned in a belief that easy access to cool drinking water would keep people from consuming alcohol. Under its stone canopy the words "Faith," "Hope," "Charity," and "Temperance" are chiseled. Atop this canopy is a life-sized heron, and the centerpiece is a pair of entwined heraldic scaly dolphins. Originally, visitors were supposed to freely drink ice water flowing from the dolphins' snouts with a brass cup attached to the fountain and the overflow was collected by a trough for horses, but the city tired of having to replenish the ice in a reservoir underneath the base and disconnected the supply pipes.
These grandiose statues were not all well received by the communities where they were placed. Washington, DC's Temperance Fountain has been called "the city's ugliest statue" and spurred city councils across the country to set up fine arts commissions to screen such gifts.
Simon Benson, an Oregon lumberman, was a tee-totaler who wanted to discourage his workers from drinking alcohol in the middle of the day. In 1912, Benson gave the City of Portland USD $10,000 for the installation of twenty bronze drinking fountains. As of March 2014, these fountains, known as "Benson Bubblers", continue to be used as functional public drinking devices in downtown Portland.
Temperance fountains in the United Kingdom.
The provision of drinking fountains in the United Kingdom was also linked to the temperance movement in the United Kingdom, with the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association in London drawing support from temperance advocates. Many of its fountains were sited opposite public houses. The evangelical movement was encouraged to build fountains in churchyards to encourage the poor to see churches as supporting them. Many fountains have inscriptions such as "Jesus said whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water I shall give him shall never thirst". By 1877, the association was widely accepted and Queen Victoria donated money for a fountain in Esher.
Many fountains, within London and outside, were called temperance fountains or would have a representation of the Greek mythical figure Temperance.
Examples.
Many temperance fountains were erected:

Mr Larkin's Awkward Day

"Mr Larkin's Awkward Day" is a comedy radio play by Chris Harrald, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday, 29 April 2008 as the Afternoon Play, repeated on 25 January 2010. The producer was Steven Canny. It won the Gold Award for Drama at the Sony Radio Academy Awards in 2009. 
In 1957 Philip Larkin's friend Robert Conquest, of the group known as "The Movement", played a practical joke on him. "Mr Larkin's Awkward Day" tells the true story of the joke, one that had Larkin fearing he might be sent to prison. 
The plot.
In September 1957, a pre-fame Larkin prepares for another ordinary day and picks up his post. But one letter stands out: an official-looking envelope embossed with the words "Scotland Yard". At work, and at his desk, he opens the letter -it reveals that there is an ongoing investigation into a man who is dealing in pornographic literature - and that Larkin is on the man's mailing list. Further, that investigations may be made into the names on the mailing list under the 'Pornographic Materials Act of 1921'. These investigations may be followed by charges. Larkin begins to fret about what to do. His assistant advises him that an Inspector Clough has turned up and Larkin freezes when the policeman says that he is very interested in his literary tastes. Larkin begins to defend himself until it transpires that the men have crossed wires—one fears he is being quizzed about purchasing dubious magazines, the other thinks he is having a friendly chat about literature. Finally, Larkin prises himself free from the Inspector to dash off to a meeting with his solicitors, who ask him what journals he has been buying. After he returns to his lodgings his landlady knocks on Larkin's door—someone wants him on the 'phone. It's Larkin's historian friend, Bob Conquest, and he is laughing. He asks Larkin about the silly joke he played on him, the embossed envelope and so on. When it becomes clear that Larkin was completely taken in, Conquest offers to pay his solicitors' costs.
The award.
The Sony Gold citation said: "Assured direction, excellent performances and concise, skilfully-researched writing all made this deceptively straightforward story a masterpiece. Funny and touching by turns, a single, seemingly insignificant incident in the life of Philip Larkin brought out the humanity and humour of a poet whose personal life is not commonly associated with either."

Antisthenes () of Rhodes was a Greek historian who lived c. 200 BCE. He took an active part in the political affairs of his country, and wrote a history of his own time, which, notwithstanding his bias towards his native island, is spoken of in terms of high praise by Polybius. He wrote an account of the Battle of Lade (201 BC) and was, according to Polybius, a contemporary with the events he described.
It is likely that this Antisthenes is the historian who wrote a "Successions" of the Greek philosophers which is often referred to by Diogenes Laërtius. He might also be the peripatetic philosopher cited by Phlegon of Tralles.

Bakewell railway station

Bakewell railway station was a railway station built to serve the town of Bakewell in Derbyshire, England by the Midland Railway on its extension of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midland Junction Railway line from Rowsley to Buxton.
History.
The station was opened by the Midland Railway on 1 August 1862. Being the nearest station to Haddon Hall it was built in a grand style as the local station for the Duke of Rutland over whose land the line had passed. Designed by Edward Walters of Manchester, the buildings were of fine ashlar with intricate carvings which incorporated the Duke's coat of arms.
Since the line was climbing steeply towards its summit at Peak Forest, the station was located uphill about half a mile from the town, which became a disadvantage when road transport developed.
The most busy time was during the Bakewell Show but was also popular with campers and tourists. In later years it featured a camping coach in the siding.
In the Grouping of all lines (into four main companies) in 1923 the station became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway . 
During the nationalisation of Britain's railways in 1948 the station was passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways, and despite escaping the Beeching Axe the station was closed when passenger services ceased a year prior to the line being closed by Labour Minister For Transport Barbara Castle, the station closing on 6 March 1967.
Closure.
The station buildings still survive. They are perched 1/2 mile east of the centre of Bakewell, high upon the hillside due to the alignment that the railway was forced to take.
In time the station was replaced with Bakewell industrial estate, the station building is still in use as a warehouse along with the platforms (but the gap between platforms have been filled in to facilitate the Monsal Trail).
Ridged canopies existed over the platforms, and a goods shed and cattle dock, all have since been removed.

Saenchai started learning Muay Thai when he was 8 years old. He decided to start learning Muay Thai in Jockey gym when his friend's elder brother received a prize after a bout. He debuted after training for only a week, and he won his first bout by decision receiving 30 Baht (≒$1).
He started fighting in Bangkok when he was 14 years old, then transferred to Kamsing gym owned by Somluck Kamsing. Kamsing paid 300,000 Baht as a transfer fee. This is the reason Saenchai's ring name was "Saenchai Sor.Kamsing".
When he was 15, Saenchai won the title of Lumpinee stadium championship at super flyweight. When he was 18, he won the title of Lumpinee stadium championship at bantamweight.
Turning to boxing.
In 2002, Saenchai turned to boxing. He debuted as "Sangpetch Patanakan Gym" at featherweight. He fought against Rud 4K Kevkatchewon from Philippines to challenge for the vacant interim title of PABA on November 27, 2003, and he won the title by unanimous decision. In January 2004, he retained his PABA title against Rud.
In 2004, he decided to go back to Muay Thai again.
Discord with Khamsing.
Saenchai visited Japan twice to fight and Khamsing agreed at those times, but Khamsing disagreed the third time. Although Khamsing tried to stop Saenchai from going to Japan, he went there with some Muay Thai fighters from another gym. Because of this incident, Khamsing broke off relations with Saenchai, and Saenchai moved to Kingstar gym. At this time, Khamsing received 300,000 Baht from Kingstar gym as a transfer fee.
On July 3, 2006, Saenchai fought against Sang-Soo Lim from Korea in Japan. Saenchai was going to fight against Shinya Ishige but he was replaced two weeks earlier as he had been injured during training. Lim was taller 21 cm and heavier 10 kg than Saenchai but Saanchai knocked out Lim at 2R with a right hook.
On July 3, 2009, Saenchai fought against two muay thai fighters in the single bout at Lumpinee stadium. During 1 to 3 round, he fought against Petchboonchu F.A. Group. Petchboonchu tried to attack aggressively at 1R, but Saenchai carried throughout his stamina-saving style and broke Petchboonchu's balance several times. During 4 to 5 round, Saenchai fought against Sakeddaow Petchpayathai. Saenchai controlled his critical distance with front-kicks and middle-kicks and he threw telling blows more than Sakeddaow did. The referee announced Saenchai's victory with unanimous decision after 5R.
Winning world title.
On March 14, 2010, Saenchai fought against Tetsuya Yamato from Japan to challenge the vacant world lightweight title sanctioned by Muay Thai Association of America (MTAA) in Los Angeles. Saenchai knocked out Yamato with left high kick at 1R, and won the MTAA title.
First loss to a European.
On January 21, 2012 Saenchai lost for the first time against a European in Muay Thai rules. The fight took place in Milan Italy against top foreign Thai boxer, Fabio Pinca. Saenchai had beaten Pinca years earlier. Despite going all the way up to 145, Saenchai still put up a good fight, but by the third round the size difference was starting to pay off for Pinca. He used his strength to tie Saenchai up and win a close but controversial decision. Saenchai's streak of 20 or more straight wins against foreign fighters was snapped.
He rematched Singdam Kiatmoo9 on October 4, 2012 at Rajadamnern, and won by decision.
He beat Pakorn Sakyothin by decision at "Super Showdown 4" in Glasgow, Scotland on November 10, 2012 and then took a ponts victory over Damian Alamos twelve days later at "Best of Siam 2" in Paris, France.

Devine played for Rhyl until joining Chester in 1955, with goalkeeper John Griffiths making the same move. But whereas Griffiths was to make more than 50 league appearances for the club, Devine was to be restricted to a solitary first team outing. It came on 30 March 1956 in a 2–0 home win over Halifax Town, with Devine wearing the number seven shirt in place of regular George Allman.

Antisthenes of Sparta

Antisthenes of Sparta was a Spartan admiral in the Peloponnesian war, who was sent out in 412 BC, in command of a squadron, to the coast of Asia Minor, and was to have succeeded Astyochus, in case the Spartan commissioners thought it necessary to deprive that officer of his command. We hear of him again in 399 BC, when, with two other commissioners, he was sent out to inspect the state of affairs in Asia, and announce to Dercyllidas that his command was to be prolonged for another year. There was also an Athenian general called Antisthenes.

<doc id="20170770" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20170770" title="Robert Atkyns (judge)">
Robert Atkyns (judge)

Sir Robert Atkyns KB KS (1621–1710) was an English Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, Member of parliament, and Speaker of the House of Lords.
Early life.
He was the eldest son of Sir Edward Atkyns, one of the barons of the exchequer during the Commonwealth, and the elder brother of Sir Edward Atkyns, who preceded him as lord chief baron. There had been lawyers in the family for many generations: "He himself, and his three immediate ancestors, having been of the profession for near two hundred years, and in judicial places; and (through the blessing of Almighty God) have prospered by it." In "The History of Gloucestershire" written by his son Sir Robert Atkyns(d.1711) the record of the family is carried still further back, in an unbroken legal line, to a Richard Atkyns who lived at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and "followed the profession of the law in Monmouthshire." Robert Atkyns was born in Gloucestershire in 1620. It is not certain whether he went to Oxford or to Cambridge, Alexander Chalmers including him among the famous men of Balliol College, and George Dyer among those of Sidney Sussex College. Chalmers's statement may have originated in the fact that in 1663 Atkyns received from Oxford the degree of master of arts. In 1638 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar in 1645. Mention of his name is made in some reported cases.
Parliamentary and judicial career.
In 1659, he entered Richard Cromwell's parliament as member for Evesham. Probably he was already known to sympathise with the king's party, for he was among the sixty-eight who were made knights of the Bath at Charles's coronation. His name does not appear in the list of members of Charles's first parliament, but in that of 1661 he sat for East Looe, speaking frequently upon legal questions, and, as appears from the record of the debates, with acknowledged authority. In 1661 he was made a bencher of his inn and a King's Serjeant, and about the same time was appointed recorder of Bristol. He served as one of the fire judges after the 1666 great fire of London. On the death of Sir Thomas Tyrrell in 1672 he became a judge of the court of Common Pleas. 
Along with Sir William Scroggs he was engaged in some of the trials for the Popish Plot, but there is little trace of the part which he took. He shared in the opinion that papists should be sternly dealt with; yet, to judge from his writings and his later life, it is inconceivable that he could have shared in the passion of the time. The chief civil case in which Atkyns took part during this period was that brought by Sir Samuel Barnardiston against Sir William Soame, the High Sheriff of Suffolk, which led ultimately to the passing of the act 7 & 8 Wm. III, c. 7, declaring it illegal for a sheriff to make a double return in the election of members of parliament. The points of the case are technical, but it excited keen political interest, and Atkyns's judgment, in which he differed from the majority of the court, marks the beginning of his separation from the party in power (reprinted in his "Tracts", and in 6 "St. Tr". 1074). In 1679 he retired from the bench in circumstances which lead one to believe that he was practically dismissed. Being questioned before a committee of the House of Commons in 1689, he mentioned several causes for his enforced retirement.
His judgment in "Barnardiston v. Soame" had given offence; he had declared against pensions to parliament men; he had quarrelled with Scroggs about the right to petition; and he had offended North by speaking against the sale of offices. "As to pensions, Lord Clifford took occasion to tell me 'that I had attended diligently in parliament, and was taken from my profession, therefore the king had thought fit to send me £500' I replied: 'I thank you. I will not accept anything for my attendance in parliament.' ... I did take occasion upon this to advise my countrymen 'that those who took pensions were not fit to be sent up to parliament again'". In fact Atkyns was marked out as a disaffected man. He settled in Gloucestershire, with the intention of abandoning the law, but his political opinions again brought him into trouble. When the Oxford Parliament was summoned, he was persuaded, though unwillingly, to stand for Bristol, but was defeated by Sir Richard Hart and Thomas Earle, both Tories. A strong party in the city, not content with his defeat, sought to force him to resign the recordership. The occasion was found in an illegality of which Atkyns along with others was said to be guilty in proceeding to the election of an alderman in the absence of the mayor, who was the same Sir R. Hart. The prosecution failed, but "Sir Robert Atkyns, on the Lord Pemberton's and his brother's persuasion, resigned his recordership; which was all that the city of Bristol aimed at by their indictment". In the following year came the trial of Lord Russell; he could not appear by counsel, but his friends exerted themselves in the preparation of his defence, and applied to Atkyns, who wrote to them a statement of the law. "And the like assistance being afterwards desired from me, by many more persons of the best quality, who soon after fell into the same danger, I, living at some distance from London, did venture by letters, to find the best rules and directions I could, towards the making of their just defence, being heartily concerned with them". Five years afterwards he published the letters, together with "A Defence of the late Lord Russel's Innocency", a spirited and eloquent reply to an anonymous pamphlet called "An Antidote against Poyson". To a rejoinder from the same pen, "The Magistracy and Government of England vindicated", he wrote in answer "The Lord Russel's Innocency further defended", assailing his opponent with abuse and almost expressly naming him as Sir Bartholomew Shower. In point of legal criticism Atkyns's letters and pamphlets are effective and still worth reading, but they do not shake the received opinion that the law of treason was not strained against Lord Russell. In 1684 we find his name associated with another great case, when Sir William Williams, the speaker of the House of Commons, was indicted for printing and publishing Dangerfield's narrative of the Popish Plot. Williams had acted under the orders of the House, so that the case raised the whole question of the powers and privileges of Parliament. Atkyns's argument in his defence is an elaborate review of the authorities, to show that the actions of Parliament, itself the highest court of the nation, were beyond the jurisdiction of inferior courts. Judgment was given against Williams, but in later cases the decision has been described as disgraceful. The report in the "State Trials" says that Atkyns took part in the case, and even notices that he had to borrow a wig for the purpose; but in the other reports there is no mention of his name as counsel. 
His steady attitude of resistance during these years of misgovernment met with recognition at the Revolution. In 1689 he succeeded his brother as chief baron, and in October of the same year, the great seal being in commission, he was appointed speaker of the House of Lords in the place of the Marquis of Halifax. He held the speakership until 1693, and for his services was recommended by the House to the king's favour. Towards the end of the following year he retired from the bench – through disappointment, it has been said, at not being chosen master of the rolls, but more likely owing to advancing age. Yet he still gave proof of continued vigour. In a pamphlet published in 1695, and "humbly submitted to the consideration of the House of Lords, to whom it belongeth to keep the inferior courts within their bounds," he renewed Edward Coke's protest against the insidious encroachments of the court of Chancery, tracing the growth of equitable jurisdiction, and suggesting how the common law might be restored. This was followed a few years afterwards by another tract, addressed as a petition to the House of Commons, in which, while repeating his complaint against the court of Chancery, and lamenting the uncertainty of the law, he argued from the history of Parliament that the exercise of judicial functions by the Lords was a usurpation. It should be read along with Skinner's case, in which the Lords failed in their attempt to exercise an original jurisdiction, and Dr. Shirley's case, in which they maintained their right to an appellate jurisdiction. Atkyns had himself, while in parliament, taken a vigorous part in this struggle. After 1699 we hear nothing more of him till his death. He spent his later years at Sapperton Hall in Gloucestershire, and died 18 Feb. 1710, a few weeks before his 90th birthday. Lord Campbell calls him a "virtuous judge," in what was an age of judicial scandals.

Bert Hunt

Hubert (Bert) Hunt, born at Long Ashton, Somerset, on 18 November 1911, and died at Pill, Somerset on 29 November 1985, played in 11 first-class cricket matches for Somerset in the 1936 season.
The brother of George Hunt who played 233 matches for Somerset as a professional between 1921 and 1931, Bert Hunt was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-spin bowler. He played fairly regularly for two months from the end of May to the end of July 1936 as the second spin bowler (after Horace Hazell) in the Somerset side, but in that period he bowled fewer than 100 first-class overs. But he had his moments. Against Derbyshire at Ilkeston, he took seven for 49 in the first innings and was then not called upon to bowl at all in the second innings as Somerset beat the 1936 County Champions by an innings. A week later, he was among the Somerset batsmen who hit Hedley Verity of Yorkshire and England for 89 runs from nine overs, contributing two sixes in an innings of 22 that was surpassed by Hazell, who hit Verity for four sixes in a single over. But at the end of the season, he left the Somerset staff and he never played first-class cricket again.
Journalist David Foot, the historian of Somerset cricket, wrote of Hunt that he had "a healthy cynicism about the life of an expendable professional cricketer" and that he "preferred to stick to his weekend matches for his village team, Lodway". Foot added: "His pals in the parish used to say of him: 'He had the most perfect temperament we ever came across – the bowler who never complained. We could put down five catches off him, as we did more than once, and he merely smiled'."
After leaving first-class cricket, Hunt played Minor Counties cricket for Cornwall in 1939 and 1948, when he took 23 wickets at an average of 17 apiece. He was an umpire in Minor Counties matches in 1950.

Metropolitan Jewish Hospice

The Metropolitan Jewish Hospice coordinates pain management and other needed services for terminally ill patients of any age living in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx and Nassau County. Care can be received at home and/or in select skilled nursing facilities. 
The program began as one of 15 state demonstrations in 1980 and has been certified by the Joint Commission since 1995. Hospice offers culturally sensitive care to patients and families of all faith traditions.
A primary care nurse coordinates all services for the patients. Hospice staff provides social work services, nutritional counseling and spiritual support. Hospice holds contracts with outside agencies to provide home health assistance, prescription medication and medical supplies. The program also recruits and trains volunteers who visit patients.
Hospice staff utilizes a number of inpatient facilities in several boroughs, including skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, for the provision of care. The program accepts individuals with Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance and managed care plans.
Orthodox Jewish patients.
Because Orthodox Jewish patients look to Jewish law (Halakha) and tradition for guidance and answers regarding hospice care, Metropolitan Jewish Hospice created the "Halachic Pathway" that enables Orthodox Jewish patients to sign a "Halachic" Living Will if they so choose. Patients who choose the "Halachic Pathway" elect to have their care directed by a "Halachic" advisor in collaboration with their physician and Hospice’s medical director.
Specialized services.
Hospice has specialized art and music therapy programs. The Art and Soul Project helps children and teens deal with the emotional effects of advanced illness or death of a loved one through therapeutic creative expression. The goal of the music therapy program is to make the lives of patients, many of whom are dealing with advanced illness, more comfortable and contented through the power of music.

Biali Kurierzy

White Couriers (Polish: "Biali Kurierzy") was a group of around 20-30 Polish boyscouts and former soldiers of the Polish Army, most of whom had been associated with the interbellum sports club Junak Drohobycz. It existed between October 1939 and July 1940, when it was broken by the Soviet NKVD. The task of the White Couriers was to smuggle people from Soviet-occupied southeastern part of the Second Polish Republic, to the Hungarian province of Carpathian Ruthenia and further to Budapest. The White Couriers were part of the Grey Ranks (Polish: Szare Szeregi), a wartime codename for the underground Polish Scouting Association 
Following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, eastern Poland, known as Kresy, was annexed by the Soviet Union, allied with Nazi Germany. The Soviets immediately began campaign of a large-scale mass terror, with hundreds of thousands of people deported to Siberia. The terror was mostly aimed at Polish members of upper classes, policemen, civil servants, soldiers and Intelligentsia, as well as Ukrainian nationalists. 
Creation of the White Couriers was directly connected with the Soviet terror, as hundreds of people, mostly from the city of Lwow, decided to escape Soviet Union across the Soviet-Hungarian border in Eastern Carpathians, which had been established as a result of Soviet and Nazi aggression of Poland. The Couriers were mostly young men in their 20s or even teens, members of the prewar Polish Scouting Association and athletes of the Junak Drohobycz sports club. They knew the landscape very well and within 10 months they managed to smuggle an unknown number of persons. On their way back from Hungary, they took money, Polish-language newspapers published in the West as well as orders of the Government in exile. 
The group was subject to the Ewa department (an abbreviation of the word evacuation) of the Polish Embassy in Budapest and among others, was supported by Major Mieczyslaw Mlotek. The name came from a humorous dialog of Szczepcio and Tonco, popular Polish Radio Lwow characters of the Merry Lwow Wave. 
The couriers worked alone or in pairs. All had to be physically and emotionally strong, it was crucial for them to know the borderland area, guarded by the NKVD border troops. Altogether, there were up to 30 of them, only four survived World War II. Majority was captured and executed by the Soviet occupiers. One of the survivors, Tadeusz Chciuk-Celt, also known as Marek Celt, wrote a book White Couriers, in which he described their fate.

Prussian T 14.1

The Prussian Class T 14.1 was a German 2-8-2T, goods train, tank locomotive operated by the Prussian state railways and the Royal Württemberg State Railways. They were later incorporated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn into the DRG renumbering plan for steam locomotives as DRG Class 93.5–12.
Compared with the Prussian T 14 the axle load on the trailing wheels of the T 14.1 was initially 187.3 kN higher than that of the driving wheels. Later this was able to be reduced to 170,6 kN. The water tanks and coal bunkers were larger, so that more water and coal could be carried. Through changes in the running gear, the top speed could be increased to 70 km/h.
Because many engines had been lost due to break downs or World War I reparations, the Württemberg State Railway procured these locomotives initially for the lines from Esslingen am Neckar via Stuttgart to Ludwigsburg. They were based on the Prussian T 14.1 and differed only in a few details from their prototype.
In all 729 vehicles were procured between 1918 and 1924 for the Prussian state railways and the Prussian railway divisions of the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The Royal Württemberg State Railways and the DRG's Stuttgart division bought 39 engines between 1921 and 1922. They were given numbers 93 501 - 1261, of which 93 795–814 and 832–850 were former Württemberg machines.
The Deutsche Bundesbahn retired the last T 14.1, designated in 1968 as Class 093, that same year. In the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) the engines, which had been designated in 1970 as 93.1–6, were withdrawn by 1972.
The only existing example, number 93 526, is to be found in the German Steam Locomotive Museum at Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg and is currently being restored there.

Matchless G50

The Matchless G50 is a racing British motorcycle made by Associated Motorcycles (AMC) at the former Matchless works in Plumstead, London. Developed in 1958 from the 350cc AJS 7R, but with the engine capacity increased to 500 cc, 180 G50s (for 50 bhp) were built in the next four years. Although less powerful than its main competitor the Norton Manx the G50 proved highly competitive at three hundred pounds and was faster round bends. If success is measured by longevity then this is the most successful Matchless motorcycles as high specification replicas are still being produced to this day although financial problems at AMC ended production in 1963.
The G50 CSR.
In 1963, the AMA decided that the G50 should not be allowed to race in the USA as it was not based on a production street bike. Matchless solved the problem by creating the street-legal G50 CSR, fitting the G50 engine into the G80CS Scrambler frame. 
The designation CSR stood for "Competition, Sprung and Roadster" but quickly got called the "Coffee Shop racer". It later became known as the "Golden Eagle" after the name was used in advertising (due to the gold finish of the engine casings). 
By the time the G50 was reinstated, however, it was no longer in production. 
There were just two colour options - bright blue with a tan seat or bright red and black with a black seat.
Seeley Condor G50.
Financial problems at AMC ended production in 1963 and all the tooling and spares were sold to sidecar Grand Prix racer Colin Seeley in 1966. Seeley went on to develop the engine and made his own custom frames to produce a number of G50 'specials' some of which were known as the called the Seeley Condor. These exclusive motorcycles continue to be hand built to this day to individual customer specifications by TGA Ltd, now based in northern France. As well as building motorcycles from new parts, TGA also convert secondhand racing motorcycles for road use.
Seeley G50Mk2.
The Seeley G50Mk2 racing motorcycles built by TGA Ltd are high specification with a Titchmarsh chassis, Walmsley G50 motor, 6 speed PGT gearbox and lightweight fairing.
George Beale G50 replicas.
Former Isle of Man TT winner George Beale set up George Beale Motorcycles in Coleorton, Leicestershire to make a range of replica motorcycles, including Matchless G50 racing motorcycles to a high specification which includes a special lightweight frame and swing arm, Ceriani forks and a magnesium six speed gear box with lightweight clutch.

Neanthes of Cyzicus

Neanthes (; ) is apparently the name of two writers whose works have largely been lost. The elder Neanthes of Cyzicus was a disciple of Philiscus of Miletus ("who is reasonably certain to have died before 300 BC"), who himself had been a pupil of Isocrates. An honorary decree of 287 BC in which the people Delphi award him the proxeny ("Fouilles de Delphes" 1.429 = FGrHist 84 T 2) is the earliest of "only five decrees from the third century honoring historians, teachers of grammar or literature, or philosophers for their educational activities in the cities' gymnasia."
He was a voluminous writer, principally of history, but very little has reached us to form any judgement of his merits. The various authors that quote him seem, with rare exceptions, to place great reliance on his accuracy and judgement. He is frequently referred to by Diogenes Laërtius, Athenaeus, and by several of the early Christian writers, as well as by others. Among the writings of Neanthes there were:
He probably wrote an account of Cyzicus, as we can infer from a passage in Strabo. He may also have written many panegyrical orations and a work Περὶ κακοζηλίας ῥητορικῆς or Περὶ ζηλοτυπίας against the Asiatic style of rhetoric. This latter work, as well as the history of Attalus I (who ruled 241-197), are irreconcilable with the dates of the Delphian decree and of Philiscus of Miletus; therefore, it is supposed that they are the work of a later Neanthes of the second century BC.

Ernst Forsthoff

Ernst Forsthoff (13 September 1902, Laar – 13 August 1974, Heidelberg) was a German scholar of constitutional law and a leading theorist of administrative law.
Life.
Forsthoff, the son of pastor , was called to teach law at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität in Frankfurt am Main 1933, at the University of Hamburg in 1935, at the Albertina in Königsberg in 1936 and at the University of Vienna in 1942. There he was forbidden to exercise his teaching post by the Gestapo until 1943, when he was called to the University of Heidelberg.
After the war, he was dismissed from governmental service by order of the American military government, but was able to resume teaching in 1952. Forsthoff was a leading author of the Constitution of Cyprus and was president of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus from 1960 to 1963.
Thought.
In the 1930s, Forsthoff was among the jurists such as Carl Schmitt, , and who endeavoured to legitimise the Nazi regime through their writings. Forsthoff's 1933 paper "Der totale Staat" (The Total State) advocated a broad understanding of the "Führerprinzip" as an exclusive and unlimited power of command over all subjects of the state. He himself was unwilling to submit fully to the Nazi state, however, and fell in disfavour with the authorities during the war. In a seminal 1938 paper, he coined the term "Daseinsvorsorge", introducing the concept of public services to German legal thinking.
After the war, although now supporting the democratic "Rechtsstaat" (which he understood as opposed to the "Sozialstaat" advocated by the Left), Forsthoff continued to support a powerful state subject to only limited judicial constraints and rejected the notion of constitutional rights as a normative framework of society.
Forsthoff was among the few postwar European scholars who maintained adherence to the philosophy of strict legal positivism. His influential textbook "Lehrbuch des Verwaltungsrechts" (1950) also emphasized the comprehensive responsibility of the state for society, preferring to focus on the functioning of government rather than on its possible failure.

Chief Tecopa (c.1815–1904) was a Native American leader, his name means wildcat. Chief Tecopa was a leader of the Southern Nevada tribe of the Paiute in the Ash Meadows and Pahrump areas. In the 1840s Tecopa and his warriors engaged the expedition of Kit Carson and John C. Fremont in a three-day battle at Resting Springs. Later on in life Tecopa tried to maintain peaceful relations with the white settlers to the region and was known as a peacemaker. Tecopa usually wore a bright red band suit with gold braid and a silk top hat. Whenever these clothes wore out they were replaced by the local white miners out of gratitude for Tecopa's help in maintaining peaceful relations with the Paiute.<br>Tecopa is buried with his son and grandson at the Chief Tecopa Cemetery in the Pahrump Valley, Nevada.
The Census-designated place of Tecopa, California was named after Chief Tecopa by J. B. Osbourne who was the operator of a mining camp at the location.

Parc le Breos

Parc le Breos was a great medieval deer park in the south of the Gower Peninsula, about eight miles (13 km) west of Swansea, Wales, and about north of the Bristol Channel. The park was an enclosed, oval area of in circumference, covering about and measuring  miles (east–west) by just over  miles (4.1 km by 2.9 km). "Parc le Breos" was established in the 1220s CE by John de Braose (of the powerful Cambro-Norman de Braose dynasty), Marcher Lord of Gower and husband to Margaret Ferch Llywelyn, "Llywelyn Fawr's" daughter. Other than for deer husbandry, the park received an income from agistment, pannage, and from sales of wild honey, ferns and dead wood. There is evidence of rabbit warrening in the park. Whether the warrens were free or domestic is unknown. 
The park's boundary was originally marked by a wooden fence, or pale, on the top of an earth bank inside a ditch. Some parts of the pale survive.
Prehistoric finds and an Iron Age enclosure (above Parkmill) show the area of "Parc le Breos" to have been settled by modern humans since the earliest times.
History.
The area that would become "Parc le Breos" has been inhabited by modern humans since the earliest times. The Cathole Cave – a steep, limestone outcrop, about from the floor of a dry narrow limestone gorge, now known as the "Parc le Breos Cwm" valley – has been used as a shelter by bands of Mesolithic hunters and as a Neolithic ossuary. The cave is a deep triangular fissure penetrating the hillside and narrowing towards the top. It has two entrances, with a natural platform outside the larger of the two. Excavations revealed two tanged points that may date to c. 28,000 years before present (BP), an interglacial period during the Late Pleistocene. Late glacial tool finds from the Upper Palaeolithic date to c. 12,000 BP. Animal remains were found at the same level as the Upper Palaeolithic tools, providing evidence of the climate c. 12,000 BP: Red Fox; Arctic Fox; Brown Bear; Tundra Vole; and possibly reindeer. Animal remains excavated at the cave during the nineteenth century include mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, Red Deer and Giant Deer, which are yet to be accurately dated. Several finds date to the Bronze Age: a bronze socketed axe; two human skeletons; and sherds of pottery, from burial urns and other vessels.
Workmen digging for road stone in 1869 uncovered an early Neolithic cromlech built around 5850 BP – now known as "Parc Cwm" long cairn or "Parc le Breos" burial chamber (after the park) – about south of The Cathole Cave, along the "Parc le Breos Cwm" valley. An excavation later that year revealed human bones (now known to have belonged to at least 40 people), animal remains and Neolithic pottery. Identified in 1937 as one of the Severn-Cotswold type of megalithic chambered tomb, the cromlech was partly restored following an excavation during 1960–1961. North-West European lifestyles changed around 6,000 BP, from the nomadic lives of the hunter-gatherer, to a settled life of agricultural farming – the Neolithic Revolution. However, analysis of the human remains found at the cromlech show the tomb to have been accessed for up to 800 years and that the people interred within it continued to be either hunter-gatherers or herders, rather than agricultural farmers.
A trapezoidal cairn of rubble – the upper part of the cromlech and its earth covering now removed – about long by (at its widest), is revetted by a low dry-stone wall. A bell-shaped, south-facing forecourt, formed by the wall, leads to a central passageway lined with limestone slabs set on end. Human remains had been placed in the two pairs of stone chambers that lead from the passageway. Corpses may have been placed in nearby caves until they decomposed, when the bones were moved to the tomb.
The Llethryd Tooth Cave, or Tooth Hole cave, is an Early Bronze Age ossuary site in a limestone cave, about north, northwest of the Parc Cwm long cairn cromlech, on private land along the "Parc le Breos Cwm" valley, near the village of Llethryd. The cave was rediscovered by cavers in 1961, who found human bones. The excavation carried out by D.P. Webley & J. Harvey in 1962 revealed the disarticulated remains (i.e. incomplete skeletons) of six adults and two children, dated to the Early Bronze Age or Beaker culture. Other contemporary finds, now held at the Amgueddfa Cymru–National Museum Wales, Cardiff, include collared urn pottery, flaked knives, a scraper, flint flakes, a bone spatula, a needle and bead, and animal bones – the remains of domesticated animals, including cat and dog. Archaeologists Alasdair Whittle and Michael Wysocki note that this period of occupation may be "significant", with respect to "Parc Cwm" long cairn, as it is "broadly contemporary with the secondary use of the tomb".
The "cwmwd" of Gŵyr, within the "Cantref" of Eginog and part of Ystrad Tywi, became part of the Kingdom of Deheubarth – founded by Hywel Dda (c. 920) from the Kingdoms of Dyfed and Seisyllwg. Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick conquered Gŵyr c. 1100, styling himself Lord of Gower. Southern Gower was colonised, and eventually became heavily anglicised. Rhys Gryg – fourth son of Rhys ap Gruffydd (The Lord Rhys) – of Deheubarth occupied the peninsula in 1215, but in 1220 he ceded the area to the English, apparently on the orders of Llywelyn ap Iorwerth. Before its emparkment, the area of "Parc le Breos" had been woodland. Its harvesting was implied on medieval rolls. 
The Act of Union (1536) made the Lordship of Gower part of the historic county of Glamorgan, and the south-western section became the Hundred of Swansea.
A Hunting Lodge was built in the 19th century, about north east of "Parc Cwm" long cairn. It is now an hotel and pony trekking (horse riding) centre and retains the name "Parc le Breos".
Lunnon.
The eastern half of "Parc le Breos" was disemparked, probably in the late 13th century, when it became a demesne farm – a manorial farm also known as a grange. Other than it being woodland in the 1220s, little more is known of the area until this time. The Lord of Gower's grange is noted on an account roll for 1337-8; as 'Grangia de Lunan'. 
– in which the village of Lunnon would be built.
During the mid 16th century the remainder of the park changed use too, from a deer park to farmland, when all but the limestone gorge "cwm" and about 500 acres of woodland was divided into three farms.
Location.
The remaining parkland of "Parc le Breos" is in "Coed y Parc", about seven  miles (12 km) west south west of Swansea, Wales, in the southern part of central Gower Peninsula, between the villages of Llanrhidian and Bishopston (). Its nearest village is Parkmill, a small rural settlement about one mile (1.5 km) to the south east.
"Coed y Parc" is owned and managed by Forestry Commission Wales. Pedestrian access is allowed and is free, with free parking for 12–15 cars about from the site. On the opposite side of the lane to the car park a kissing gate, wide enough for a wheelchair to pass through, leads to an asphalt track running past the cromlech and the length of the gorge, allowing flat, disabled access to within about ten feet (3 m) of the cromlech. "Parc Cwm" long cairn is maintained by "Cadw" (), the Welsh Assembly Government's historic environment division.

“In response to the tragic events of September 11, photographer Nathan Lyons—known for his honest and often questioning depictions of American culture—has created a poignant portfolio of images. Photographing in small towns and large cities, Lyons has captured the extreme and often confusing variety of responses—from deep reverence to blatant commercialization—manifested by ordinary Americans.

Demetrius of Magnesia

Demetrius of Magnesia (1st century BC) was a Greek grammarian and biographer, and a contemporary of Cicero and Atticus. He had, in Cicero's recollection, sent Atticus a work of his on concord, (), which Cicero also was anxious to read. A second work of his, which is often referred to, was of an historical and philological nature, and treated of poets and other authors who bore the same name (). This important work, to judge from what is quoted from it, contained the lives of the persons, and a critical examination of their merits.

Tiny Tim (rocket)

The Tiny Tim was an American air to ground rocket used near the end of the Second World War. One source states it was built in response to a United States Navy requirement for an anti-shipping rocket capable of hitting ships outside of their anti-aircraft range, with a payload capable of sinking heavy shipping. However, according to the China Lake Weapons Digest, the Tiny Tim was 
For a warhead, Tiny Tim utilized a 500 lb semi-armor-piercing high explosive bomb. It had a maximum range of 1,500 meters (1,640 yards).
They were used by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps near the end of the war during the battle of Okinawa, and during the Korean War. A problem with the sheer power of the rocket motor causing damage to the firing aircraft was resolved by having the Tiny Tim drop like a bomb, and a lanyard attached to the rocket would snap, causing the rocket to ignite. Common targets included coastal defense guns, bridges, pill boxes, tanks, and shipping. An ambitious operation to use the Tiny Tim against German V-1 sites as part of Operation Crossbow, code-named Project Danny, was planned but cancelled before the squadrons assigned could be deployed to Europe.
Common Tiny Tim delivery aircraft during World War II included the PBJ-1 Mitchell, F4U Corsair, F6F Hellcat, TBM Avenger, and the SB2C Helldiver.
After World War II, the United States Navy's rocket laboratory at Inyokern, California developed an even larger version of the Tiny Tim, called "Richard", which was 14 inches in diameter and most likely the largest air to surface unguided rocket ever developed for the US military. While tested, it was never placed in production. The United States Navy also experimented with a version of the Tiny Tim which was a two-stage rocket, with another Tiny Tim rocket motor mounted behind a complete Tiny Tim. Like the Richard, it never moved beyond the R&D stage.

<doc id="20171264" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20171264" title="Rob Pruitt">
Rob Pruitt

Robert “Rob” Pruitt (born May 17, 1964) is an American post-pop artist who explores American youth and consumer culture. Working in painting, installation, and sculpture, he does not have a single style or medium. His pieces are humorous but seductive; critics debate whether he celebrates or critiques commercial culture. While he uses pop culture imagery, his work is intensely personal and biographical. He describes his oeuvre thus: “If you look back at everything I've ever done, there's a basic formula of taking minimalist configurations and then plastering trash culture right on top of this minimalist building block."
Pruitt has exhibited extensively in New York and internationally; in 2013 the Aspen Art Museum held his mid-career retrospective. 
Biography.
Born in Washington, DC, Pruitt grew up in Rockville, Maryland. He attended Corcoran College of Art and Design, where he became friendly with the admissions director, Tim Gunn. Pruitt transferred to Parsons School of Design when Gunn began teaching there. During college, Pruitt lived at the Chelsea Hotel and says he focused his energy on partying rather than studying.
He currently resides in New York City with his partner Jonathan Horowitz, who is also an artist.
Art Work.
Early Work.
Pruitt began exhibiting in the early 1990s with his then collaborator, Jack Early. After a controversial exhibition at Leo Castelli Gallery their partnership disintegrated and neither had major shows for several years. 
While galleries refused to represent his solo work, Pruitt contributed to a few group shows. Pieces from this time dealt with his exclusion from the art world; his first sculpture at Gavin Brown’s enterprise was an Evian fountain, which, as Mia Fineman points out, is related to baptism and rebirth.
In 1998 Pruitt caused another minor scandal with a piece called Cocaine Buffet. He installed a 16-foot mirror with a line of real cocaine running down the center, in which visitors were welcome to partake. Publicity stunt, peace offering, minimalist sculpture, or indictment of the greed and glamour of the art world, it changed the sensation associated with his name.
101 Art Ideas You Can Do Yourself.
The following year Pruitt held his first solo show, “101 Art Ideas You Can Do Yourself,” where he applied humor to the genre of language-based conceptual art. The recipe-style book was filled with instructions for making and decorating such as “Paint secret paintings on walls with glow in the dark paint” and “Draw yourself into your favorite comic strip.” Others were suggestions on how to interact with the world in a different way, like “Sit on the toilet backwards” and “Go on an animal photo safari in a city: dogs, cats, pigeons, rats, and squirrels.”
The exhibition was thirty-five of these instructions realized, including an exercise bike facing a painting and a pile of pennies on the floor. During the time he was barred from the art world, Pruitt briefly worked for Martha Stewart Living, coming up with DIY craft ideas; a DIY sensibility runs throughout his work.
Pandas.
In 2001 Pruitt showed the first of the glittery panda paintings that would become his trademark.
He explains his choice of subject matter thus: “I see it as a kind of corporate damage control -- like trying to market Perrier after they found benzene in it, or Firestone tires after they exploded. I was a reviled figure, but everybody loves a panda.” He remembers childhood visits to the giant pandas at the National Zoo. 
Pruitt has made many versions his panda painting using different techniques and stylizations of the same subject matter. 
Critic Michelle Grabner analyzes the panda project thus: “The paintings' clichéd imagery neutralizes their real endangered status making us less culpable in the creatures' pending extinction. And therein lies the beauty of the clichéd image." She goes on, "This appropriation of similes, once strictly the providence of kitsch, has nothing to do with blurring the distinctions between high and low. Instead, rainbows and butterflies have come to symbolize a magical new world where order is without hierarchies, edification is without snobbishness[…]Pruitt produces his art without the slightest glance of irony. He makes glamorous and admirable our drive for worldly success while commiserating with our search for inner virtue.”
Although the paintings are designed and tightly crafted, they are imperfect; the artist’s hand is evident. His use of glitter has been compared to Andy Warhol's diamond dust, but Pruitt describes his own work as “basically blown up versions of dining table craft projects... I’ve really enjoyed letting the world know that not everything is so mystified or so regulated to expertise—that you can make something really beautiful with a little ingenuity and some supplies from Michael’s.” 
Pruitt collaborated with Jimmy Choo in 2012 to create a line of shoes and handbags featuring panda bears and animal prints.
In 2013 Pruitt installed his "Last Panda" show at Gavin Brown's defunct bar, the Passerby. The space, which was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy, provided an apocalyptic setting for his rainbow-colored work.
Flea Market.
Pruitt began his Flea Market happening for the 1999 Gavin Brown summer show. He invited artist friends to set up tables and sell whatever they wanted, be it their own artwork or junk from their apartment. The gallery space became a place to socialize with the artist, creating a feeling of community between makers and sellers. The Flea Market has since been repeated at art fairs and museums. 
For the market’s latest iteration, Pruitt is running an eBay store, which features a curated selection from his collection of secondhand objects.
Describing shopping as a familiar, comforting activity, he regularly attends estate sales.
Art Awards.
The Guggenheim approached him in 2009 to reimagine their annual fund-raising event. Instead of the usual gala, Pruitt conceived a performance piece: a tongue-in-cheek, Oscars-style award show, with nominees for categories like Solo Gallery Show of the Year, Critic of the Year, and Best New Artist. Like much of Pruitt’s work, the show falls somewhere between sincerity and parody.
Although it is not unheard of to give awards for fine art (in Britain, for example, the Tate awards the prestigious Turner Prize), Pruitt’s Art Awards are not universally popular with critics. Artist of the Year Mary Heilmann describes them as “serious and deep and cheesy at the same time.” 
The 2013 rendition of the art awards appeared in Art in America and featured selfies of the nominees.
Pattern and Degradation.
2010 saw Pruitt's sprawling solo show “Pattern and Degradation,” which was considered confirmation of his part of the art establishment. The show was held at Gavin Brown and spilled over to the nearby gallery Maccarone Inc.
It featured brightly patterned paintings influenced by Amish quilt designs. Pruitt was inspired by the idea of rumspringa, a time when Amish youths leave their community to experience the broader world before returning to the church and responsibility. He describes an artist's life as a kind of perpetual rumspringa, less constrained as artists are from the traditional expectations of society.
The show also included humanoid monsters made out of trash, collaged self-portraits, candy-filled stacks of painted tires, and photorealistic paintings of Cinnabon cinnamon rolls with geometrically piped paint for icing. Randy Kennedy describes a unifying theme to the multivalent show: “Everything in it seems to pivot on the idea of pattern and design as a valiant but usually doomed attempt to impose some order and beauty on a random, chaotic world.”
Gradient Paintings.
Pruitt has made a variety of paintings with colored gradients. The “Faces” series are scrawled line drawings of features that are then transferred onto gradients and flocked. Reminiscent of emoji, each face has a distinct emotion or personality.
These developed into a later series called “The Suicide Paintings,” window-like portals consisting of pure gradients juxtaposed by a differently colored frame. While the gradients are close to perfect, they are not digitally generated. These paintings were installed with chromed television sets and stacks of black and white cubes. They look like color studies, polluted vistas, and screen savers. Critic Florence Waters describes her experience with the work: "The absence of a story is made alarming by the scale and intensity of the encounter with colour on canvas."
Other Projects.
Pruitt and Jonathan Horowitz collaborated on an installation piece called Peacock Hill. In 2003 they bought a ramshackle, eleven-bedroom Victorian mansion in Fleischmanns, New York, painted it black, and decorated it like a haunted house with faux taxidermy and gothic furniture. Outside they arranged a graveyard using plywood tombstones with sardonic inscriptions. Ken Johnson compared it to the self-mocking art-as-life collaborations of Gilbert and George but overall described the project as self-congratulatory. 
Pruitt used tombstones again in a 2008 show where he created monuments for celebrities who had died the previous year. They were installed in a room whose walls were papered in a year's worth of iPhone photographs.
In 2011 Pruitt created "The Andy Monument" for the Public Art Fund; it is a ten-foot-tall, chrome-finished statue of Andy Warhol. The sculpture resided outside the building that housed Warhol's Factory in the 1970s and early 1980s.
Art Market.
Represented by Gavin Brown's Enterprise and Massimo de Carlo, Pruitt shows regularly at art fairs. He is also known for throwing parties; on 4/20, 2013 he turned MOCA's annual gala into a weed-themed bacchanalia, which raised over two million dollars.
In June 2013 his work set a record price at a Christie’s charity auction when a panda painting sold for $315,000, over twice its estimated value.

Plaster (band)

Plaster is a Canadian electro-jazz/electro-rock band formed in 2001 in Montreal. Their sound has been compared to such artists as Amon Tobin, Kruder & Dorfmeister and Medeski Martin & Wood. The trio's debut album, "First Aid Kit", was released on Nov 10, 2005 and won the ADISQ award for Best Electronic or Techno Album in 2006.
History.
Keyboardist Alex McMahon and percussionist Jean-Philippe Goncalves (also of Afrodizz and Beast) met while attending the Cégep de Drummondville. The pair formed Plaster in 2001 and were joined by bassist François Plante (also of Afrodizz) a year later.
The trio's name is derived from a slang term in Québécois for an adhesive bandage and its sound has been described as a mixture of electro-jazz, funk, and drum and bass (however Goncalves has stated in an interview that he finds the term "electro-jazz" to be somewhat pejorative and described their sound as "electro-chunky-jam".) Their sound is at times atmospheric, much like movie soundtrack; in a 2005 interview with the Montreal Gazette, McMahon stated that Plaster was interested in composing a movie score, but the band was still waiting on proposal. Their live performances are improvisational and have been described as having the energy of a rock show. As per Plaster's biography from its official press kit, the band's sound is inspired by the music of Amon Tobin, The Herbaliser, Jazzanova, The Cinematic Orchestra, and Medeski Martin & Wood.
Plaster's debut album "First Aid Kit" was released on Nov 10, 2005. The album was originally to be released on the London label Ninja Tune, but due to frustration with the label's push-back of the release date they decided instead to sign with local label La Tribu. The "First Aid Kit" release party, held at Montreal nightclub La Tulipe, was a great success; much to their own surprise the band opened to a capacity crowd and sold all the CDs they had on hand that night. In 2006 "First Aid Kit" went on to win the ADISQ award for Best Electronic or Techo Album.
In 2005 the band also collaborated with Lauryn Hill; Hill was in Montreal looking for collaborators for a new project she was developing. Goncalves was invited to audition for her and to demonstrate his programming expertise. He returned the next day for another session when a producer in attendance mentioned that Goncalves also played drums. Goncalves advised Hill that he was a member of a band and an hour later he was joined by his Plaster bandmates. During an interview with the Montreal Gazette Goncalves said of the experience: "We recorded until 6 in the morning, and then she left for New York City." "It was 12 intense hours with "la reine de R&B soul" (the queen of R&B soul)," said McMahon. The pair were however wouldn't elaborate much more on the collaboration. "We had a lot of fun with her, but it's a delicate topic. I don't know what to say. It was nice," said Goncalves.
In 2011 the band returned to the studio to work on their second album. In an interview with "La Presse" Goncalves stated that whereas Plaster's first album could be described as electro-jazz, there second album could be described as electro-rock. Titled "Let It All Out", the album was released on May 15, 2012 and debuted at number 43 in Canada.

TroopTube

TroopTube was an online video site from the U.S. military via their organization Military OneSource, to help military families connect and keep in touch while miles apart. TroopTube allowed people to register as members of one of the branches of the armed forces, family, civilian Defense Department employees or supporters. Members could upload personal videos from anywhere with an Internet connection. The videos were reviewed for content based on the terms of service before being posted to the site.
In May, 2009, TroopTube was recognized by the White House office of New Media as an innovative way for people to connect with troops, and was featured in a video produced by the White House. While access to TroopTube is blocked at some military bases, it is accessible via many other military bases and available to military families around the world. The site is based on technology developed by Delve Networks.
On July 31, 2011, The Department of Defense, Office of the Secretary of Defense closed the TroopTube web site citing declining usage as a result of the DoD's Social Media policy implemented in February 2010, permitting wider access to social media and video sharing websites.

List of laws and reports on LGBT rights in the Republic of Ireland

This is a list of laws, court cases and reports on LGBT rights in Ireland.
Buggery Act, 1533.
This was passed by the English parliament under King Henry VIII and applied to England and Wales only. It is also known as (25 Henry VIII c. 6). It outlawed the practice of 'buggery' which is male-to-male sexual intercourse. The penalty was death. It was the first piece of civil law to outlaw male-to-male sex acts. Ireland was a separate kingdom and had its own parliament. It is unclear if the Irish parliament passed a similar piece of legislation. Often the Irish parliament passed legislation that mirrored legislation of England.
Offences Against the Person (Ireland) Act 1829.
This act brought the provisions of the Offences Against the Person Act 1828 into law in Ireland. Under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1828 buggery was punishable by death.
Offences Against the Person Act 1861.
This act updated and streamlined the criminal law of Great Britain and Ireland. It outlawed many forms of practices including 'buggery' or male-to-male penetrative sex. The punishment was life imprisonment or a jail sentence of not less than 10 years for male-to-male penetrative sex. It abolished the death penalty for such acts, which has been law up to this point.
Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.
Commonly known as the Labouchere Amendment. This act outlawed what was termed ‘acts of gross indecency’ between men both in public and in private. The definition was vague and included intimate acts falling short of penetrative sex between two men. Male to male sex was illegal under previous law but it was very narrowly interpreted by the courts. Usually the courts required that penetration to have occurred for 'buggery' to have taken place. This new act made it much easier to punish the intimate acts of men together. The penalty was a maximum of two years imprisonment. The most famous person to be convicted under this act was Oscar Wilde.
Vagrancy Act 1898.
This prohibited soliciting or importuning for immoral purposes. It was originally intended as a measure against prostitution, however in practice these measures where almost solely applied to male-to-male sex acts.
Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1912.
This allowed flogging to be used as a punishment against existing crimes in regards to sexual offences.
Criminal Law Bill 1921.
Proposed to extend the provision criminalising gross indecency between males to gross indecency between women. This bill was dropped due to those who felt that to even criminalise female-to-female sex acts would draw attention to these acts and publicise them. As a result female-to-female sex acts were legal, unlike male-to-male sex acts.
Norris v. the Attorney General (1980) (High Court).
David Norris, later to become a senator for Trinity College, Dublin and presidential candidate, took the Attorney General to the High Court over the criminalisation of male-to-male sex. He argued that the law infringed on his right to privacy to have consensual sex with a man and that since the introduction of the Constitution of Ireland the law passed under British rule became repugnant to the constitution. The High Court ruled against Norris. He appealed his case to the Supreme Court.
Norris v. the Attorney General (1983) (Supreme Court).
Having lost his High Court case Norris appealed his case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law by a three to two verdict.
Norris v. Ireland (1988) (European Court of Human Rights).
Having lost the Supreme Court case Norris took his case to the European Court of Human Rights. The European Court struck down the law criminalising male-to-male sex on the grounds of privacy. It was held that this infringed on the right of adults to engage in acts of their own choice. Irish law was regarded as too narrow and extreme.
Regulations regarding sexual orientation in the Irish Civil Service (1988).
These regulations affected the terms and conditions of employment of civil servants. These regulations prohibited discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or if a person was HIV positive.
Prohibition of Incitement To Hatred Act 1989.
Prohibited inciting hatred on various grounds include a person's sexual orientation.
Child Care Act 1991.
This act regulates the service of fostering. This act permits same-sex couples to apply jointly for fostering. This may not have been originally intended. This situation is unlike the adoption laws which strictly confines adoption to married couples and single persons. A gay man or lesbian may apply for adoption singly.
Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.
Decriminalised acts of male-to-male sex, repealed the relevant sections in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 and repealed as a whole the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. It also abolished the legal definition of ‘buggery’ for persons over the age of 17. This act also abolished ‘acts of gross indecency’ between males.
Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993.
Prohibited dismissing an employee on a number of grounds including sexual orientation.
Domestic Violence Act 1996.
Allows for a partner in a same-sex cohabiting relationship to apply for safety order or an interim protection order but does not allow for a permanent barring order which is available to married couples and opposite-sex couples. This has since been changed. See Civil Law (Misc Provisions) Act 2011 below.
Powers of Attorney Act 1996.
Widened a person's right to grant power of attorney beyond their family or next of kin. A person could grant power of attorney to their partner where that person becomes unable to make decisions for themselves due to mental incapacity.
Refugee Act 1996.
Allows refugee status to be conferred on an individual on the basis of a fear of persecution arising from their sexual orientation.
Treaty of Amsterdam 1997.
Sexual orientation was included amongst the grounds for prohibiting discrimination at work. See Treaty of Amsterdam.
Employment Equality Act 1998.
Prohibited discrimination at work on a number of grounds including sexual orientation. The acts covered aspects such as hire and fire; employment contracts; promotion and demotion; harassment at work; indirect discrimination; pay and work conditions; membership of unions and professional bodies; and participating in training courses. A general exception was granted to religious institutions under Section 37(1) of this act such as schools, hospitals and social services. Section 37(1) allows a religious run institution to claim an exemption where they can take reasonable action against an employee to uphold the ethos of their institution. This section has never been tested to date on the sexual orientation grounds. There is a proposal to change this see Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill, 2012. Mechanisms were put in place to ensure the enforcement of this Act. A person can seek mediation or adjudication with the Equality Authority or go to the Equality Tribunal for a binding ruling which can only be appealed to the courts on a point of law.
Equal Status Act 2000.
Prohibited discrimination on many grounds, including sexual orientation, in the provision of services and goods by commercial companies as well as by state institutions such as the civil service and state agencies. It covered a wide area of services such as financial produces–mortgages, savings, loans; access to building and clubs and societies–not be allowed to be told to leave on the grounds on ones sexual orientation from a nightclub etc.; the state through it civil service and its various agencies could not discriminate in matter such as–granting loans or grants to university, providing an individual dole to other social assistant; in terms of renting property a landlord could not refuse to offer accommodation to a gay man or couple or evict them on that basis. The Act also empowered the Equality Authority to monitor and enforce the law regarding equality in both the provision of goods and services and employment. A person can take a case to the Equality Authority or the Equality Tribunal in the event of discrimination occurring.
Finance Act 2000.
Allowed cohaniting couples either same-sex or opposite-sex to apply for relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax on their property in limited circumstances.
Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001.
Prohibited discrimination of the provision of health insurance on the grounds of sexual orientation. This applies to individuals and not same-sex couples.
Implementing Equality for Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals 2002.
In a wide ranging report on the situation of gays and lesbian in Ireland the Equality Authority made many recommendations for change across many areas. Most of its recommendations were non statutory. It called for all policies of the government departments to be equality proofed on the grounds to sexual orientation. It called for many changes needed to help benefit gays and lesbians for example hospital visits of partners of same sex couples, provision of services where the provider are ignorant or unaware of the needs of gays and lesbian. It also called on for civil marriage to be widened to also for same sex couples to marry. It also called on for civil partnership laws to be introduced if same sex marriage is not allowed.
Report from the National Social and Economic Forum 2003.
This report backed up the report of the Equality Authority 2002 and recommended that legislation be enacted to allow for recognition of same sex couples.
Consultation Paper on the Rights and Duties of Cohabiters by the Law Reform Commission 2004.
In this consultation paper the Law Reform Commission suggested a scheme whereby same sex and opposite sex couples who lived together for 3 years (2 years if they have a child) could make arrangements or sign a legally binding contract in regards to taxation, pensions, inheritance, custody and other matters between themselves. Married couples automatically have a wide range of rights, protections and duties under law. Same sex couples who cannot marry and opposite sex couples who live together but who choose not to marry do not benefit from many of these rights unless specifically provided so by law. There are very few such rights conferred by law to such couples. The consultation paper did not propose a schemes such as civil partnership or domestic partnership that exist in other countries, as this would prescribe a fixed bundle of rights and duties. Instead each couple would be free sign a cohabiting contract that would have the force of law. On the death or break up of a relationship one or both of the parties could apply to court to get various court orders for payment or property if they are economically dependent. The report recommended that cohabiting couples should have the right to opt out of this arrangement but the courts could lay aside this opt-out if it was judged that this opt-out would cause injustice to a former cohabitant.
Civil Registration Act 2004.
Placed a bar on the ability of two men or two women from entering into marriage. This reinforced the common law understanding that marriage is between one man and one woman. This act allows for marriages (between a man and a woman) to take place in other locations than a church and a registry office.
Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.
Enacted various provisions. It prohibited unfair discrimination in the provision of occupational pensions on the grounds of sexual orientation. This covers individuals only. This does not make a requirement for pension schemes to pay a death grant to the surviving partner of a same-sex relationship. It also limited the provision of social welfare to married couples and unmarried opposite-sex couple. Same-sex couples were to be treated as individuals and thus are ineligible for social welfare that opposite-sex cohabiting couple may benefit from. Many of these provisions have been changed under the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010.
Equality Act 2004.
Allows for positive action to be taken in the workforce in order to promote greater equality on all nine grounds as outlined in the act including sexual orientation. It also closes a loophole in regards to harassment whereby a person does not have to have the characteristics imputed about them in a situation of harassment. For example if a person is subject to homophobic jokes but that person is not gay or lesbian they may take legal action to redress the harassment. Another new provision covers people who suffer from discrimination by association. Such persons can make a case even if they do not fall into one of the nine specific groups which are covered under the legislation. For example someone who defends a co-work who is gay from harassment could in turn suffer from harassment, that person can take a case to the Equality Tribunal. Another development deals with indirect discrimination where a particular measure, while appearing neutral on the face of it, has a disproportionate impact on a particular group or individual in the workplace. Companies are required to monitor the impact of their policies on their employers and adjust their policies to cater for different needs of their employees.
Study on de facto couples by the Irish Human Rights Commission 2006.
This study published by the Irish Human Rights Commission explored the legal situation in regards to what it called de facto couples i.e. same sex and opposite sex unmarried couples. It argued that there may be a legal obligation on the Irish government to introduce legal recognition of same sex couples under the Good Friday Agreement, which has constitutional force. The Good Friday Agreement includes the principal of equivalency of rights. In other words any rights that exist in Northern Ireland must also broadly exist in the Republic of Ireland and vice versa. The study argued that since the introduction of civil partnership for same-sex couples in Northern Ireland in 2005 a case could be made for an obligation on the Irish government to introduce the same rights into the Republic.
Report of the All-party committee on the Constitution 2006.
The All-party Oireachtas committee set up to examine the constitution published a report on the provisions effecting the part about the Family. It recommended that civil partnership be introduced for same sex couples but that marriage remain restricted to men and women and that provision should me made for opposite sex couples who live together but who do not marry. Any such provisions for opposite sex couples should exclude same sex couples.
Zappone vs Revenue Commissioners (2006) (High Court).
Commonly known as the KAL case. Two women, Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan, who got married in Canada and live in Ireland, took the Revenue Commissioners to court since they refused to recognise their Canadian marriage and for refusing to grant them joint tax assessment. Married couples in Ireland are entitled to have their income jointly assessed as this reduces the overall amount of tax paid. The couple argued that marriage is not defined in the constitution to specify either same sex or opposite sex. They also argued that their rights were being infringed by the lack of recognition of their marriage. The High Court rejected the arguments of the couple. Ms Justice Dunne did accept that the Irish Constitution does not define marriage as between opposite sex couples, however she argued that marriage was traditionally understood to be between a man and a woman and that this understanding of marriage ran through all cases and legislation about the rights and duties of married couples. Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan decided to appeal their case to the Supreme Court. No date has been set for the appeal although it is expected that it will be heard in 2011.
Options Paper (2006) (Dept. of Justice, Equality and Law Reform).
This was drafted by a working group of former politicians, civil servant and members from relevant NGOs. This working group was established by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It was chaired by Anne Colley. This paper examined the various options open to the government in regards to legal recognition of cohabiting couples, both same-sex and opposite-sex. It acknowledged that only the introduction of same-sex marriage would grant full equality for same-sex couples. However the introduction of same-sex marriage would be constitutionally vulnerable. It recommended that civil partnership be introduced for same sex couples.
Report on Cohabiting couples by the Law Reform Commission 2006.
In this report the Law Reform Commission repeats it recommendations but strengthened them to allow for a wider range of protections especially those effecting pensions and employment law. It contained a draft bill to allow legal recognise of cohabiting couples. Almost all of this draft bill was included as Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act, 2010.
Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2006.
Entitles a person to take "force majeure" leave which is paid time off work to care for their same-sex partner and to make arrangements to have them taken care off in the event of a sudden illness or in an emergency. This does not cover parental leave which is not available to same-sex couples but is available to married couples, cohabiting opposite-sex couples and single parents.
European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006.
This statutory instrument put into law the EU directive 2004/38/EC. It allows a same-sex couples where one person is an EEA national and the other who is a non-EEA national to live in Ireland without the requirement of getting a work permit. The same-sex couple had to be in a relationship for 2 years and the relationship had to be attestable. that is there was proof that the relationship was genuine. This did not cover Irish nationals who were in a relationship with a non-EEA national. In 2008 this loophole was closed and non-EEA national who is cohabiting with an Irish national is not required to get a work permit.
Treaty of Lisbon 2007.
The Treaty of Lisbon was signed in 2007 and finally came into legal effect on 1 December 2009. The Treaty of Lisbon gives legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This Charter prohibits any discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of sexual orientation. The Charter is limited in its application to areas of law within the competencies of the EU. It is unclear what consequences this will have vis-á-vis Section 37 (1) of the Employment Equality Act, 1998 which grants an exemption to religious run institution to discriminate legally in order to uphold the ethos of their institution.
McD v. L (High Court) (2008).
In this case a lesbian couple P.L. and B.M. had a child using sperm donated by J.McD. a gay friend of theirs. They had arranged a contract with J.McD. The role of J.McD. was to act as an ‘uncle’ to the child but not be involved in the daily life of the child. J.McD. went to court to establish guardianship over the child, as its natural father. The High Court refused J.McD.'s application. The High Court upheld the contract agreed by P.L. and B.M. and granted them sole guardianship and custody of the child at the centre of the case. Significantly the High Court acknowledged the lesbian couple and their child as a "de facto" family who enjoyed the rights granted to families under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. The judge also called upon the Oireachtas to legislate for same-sex couple who raise children and recognise them as families.
European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (Amendment) Regulations 2008.
This amended the 2006 regulations. It removed the requirement that a same-sex couple with one of the partners being a non-EEA national must have been resident in another member state in order to move to Ireland. This meant that an Irish citizen and his or her same-sex partner could move to Ireland. This change of law came about as a result of the Metock Case which was decided at the European Court of Justice.
McD v. L (Supreme Court) (2009).
The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High Court. McD was granted guardianship over the child as its the natural father. The Supreme Court refused to grant constitutional recognition to any relationship outside of marriage.
Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.
The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 allows for same-sex couples to enter a civil partnership on the same terms as married couples. Civil partners must wait 2 years to get their partnership dissolved. Judicial separation is not allowed. Civil partners are not allowed to adopt jointly though one civil partner may adopt singly. Also civil partners cannot have joint guardianship over any children they raise together. The act provides for the of succession of property, pension entitlements, domestic violence, and maintenance in the event of a breakdown of a relationship. The social welfare benefits and the tax entitlements of civil partners are dealt with in other pieces of legislation (see below). The act makes provision for recognition of foreign relationships in Ireland as civil partnerships. The act does not deal with residency of same-sex couples that wish to become civil partnered in Ireland.
The act also provides for legal recognition of cohabiting couples (both opposite-sex and same-sex) where they have been together for 5 years or 2 years if they have children. Cohabiting couples will be able to enter into a written contract where they can arrange their affairs on finance and property and these contracts will have the force of law. Where a cohabitation relationship ends on breakdown or on death one or both of the cohabitants will be able to apply to court to get a maintenance order, property adjustment order, pension adjustment order and other such orders that married couples can get when they are separating or divorcing, provided that the person bringing the case is or was economically dependant on the other cohabitant. It took legal effect on 1 January 2011. The first public civil partnerships took place in April 2011.
Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010.
Part 2 of this act deals with the social welfare entitlements of civil partners. This act amends the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, which gives the legal basis to most of the present social welfare entitlements and schemes. Civil partners get the same benefits as married couples. Same-sex cohabiting couples who choose not to enter a civil partnership are entitled to claim benefits as a 'Qualified Adult' on the same basis as cohabiting opposite-sex couples. Since the coming into effect of this Act same-sex cohabiting couples will have their income jointly assessed when claiming social welfare.
Finance (No. 3) Act 2011.
This act grants civil partners the same tax entitlements as married coupled in income tax, stamp duty (which covers the buying and selling of homes), capital acquisitions tax (which covers the inheritance of property), capital gains tax, value added tax (VAT) and other taxes and fees. This act covers civil partners only. Same-sex cohabiting couples are not entitled to the same range of tax entitlements and must enter a civil partnership to avail of this. The provisions of this act were originally to have been included in the Finance Act, 2011 but they were left out as a shorted Finance Act was passed. This was due to the general election which was held on 25 February 2011. Some of the tax entitlements of civil partners have been made retrospective to 1 January 2011 such as capital acquisitions tax and stamp duty. Relief on income tax starts from the date of entry into a civil partnership. Married couples are treated in the same way as they gain relief on income tax from the date of marriage.
Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.
This is an omnibus act covering many areas. It amends the Domestic Violence Act, 1996. A person who is living or has lived in an intimate and committed same-sex or opposite-sex relationship will be able to apply for a barring order or a safety order. This expands the grounds of relief that a person can get. Previously same-sex couples could only get temporary relief such as stopping orders and interim protection orders. Also this act will also allow a person to apply for a safety order against a person with whom he or she had a child in common but who have never lived together.
Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010.
This bill proposes to reform the law regarding immigration and residence in Ireland. It is designed to replace all previous legislation. Under amendments proposed by the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform civil partners will be treated the same as married couples in immigration law. Some concern has been raised about family reunification for same-sex couples where one partner is a non-EU national.
Finance Bill, 2012.
This bill will amend the tax code to correct some anomalies between civil partnership and civil marriage. For example civil partners may have to pay tax on any maintenance they pay between each other if they separate or divorce where there is a child or other dependent involved. Married couples do not have to pay tax in this circumstance.
Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill, 2012.
This bill has been introduced by Senator Averil Power of Fianna Fáil. The bill aims to clarify Section 37 (1) of the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2004. Section 37 (1) gives religious run schools and hospitals an exemption from the employment equality law. They may legally discriminate against an employee in order to uphold their ethos. This has been criticised as allowing school and hospitals to discriminate against gay and lesbian employees because employing them may be seen to undermine their ethos. The bill will prohibit such institutions from discriminating on the grounds of sexual orientation and civil status (i.e. being in a civil partnership or being married).

Rob Epstein

Rob Epstein, also credited as Robert P. Epstein (born April 6, 1955 in New Jersey), is an American director, producer, writer and editor. Epstein has won two Academy Awards for Best Documentary Feature, for the films "The Times of Harvey Milk" and "". 
Recently, Epstein has transitioned from non-fiction documentaries into scripted narratives, producing such biopics as HOWL, his award-winning film about Allen Ginsberg’s controversial poem by the same name (starring James Franco), and Lovelace, the story about the life and trials of pornographic superstar Linda Lovelace (starring Amanda Seyfried).
Early Career.
Epstein began his filmmaking career at at the age of 19, after taking a Green Tortoise from New York City to San Francisco. Soon after arriving on the west coast, he answered a classified ad for a documentary seeking a production intern.
This led Epstein to become the youngest of six filmmakers in the Mariposa Film Group, the entity responsible for directing the landmark 1977 documentary "", considered to be the first feature documentary about the gay experience in America. The film played in theaters and was broadcast nationally on PBS, an unusual occurrence for a documentary at that point in time.
The Times of Harvey Milk.
After "Word Is Out", Epstein set out on his own to make a film about a series of events occurring in San Francisco in the late 1970s, which eventually became the film "The Times of Harvey Milk". During the five years it took make the film, Epstein worked a series of jobs to support himself, including as a concessionaire at the Castro Theatre, and as an assistant editing on feature and documentary films. Written, directed, and co-edited by Epstein, "The Times of Harvey Milk" premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in September 1984. "USA Today" called the film "the hit of the festival" and from there it went on to the New York Film Festival, the Sundance Film Festival where it won a Special Jury Award, and the Berlin Film Festival. The film became an international sensation and is still in distribution throughout the world. 
At the age of 29, Epstein won an Oscar for "The Times of Harvey Milk" along with producer Richard Schimechen, becoming the first "out" filmmakers to do so on the Oscar broadcast. In addition to the Oscar, "The Times of Harvey Milk" went on to receive the New York Film Critics Award for Best Non-Fiction Feature, three Emmy Awards, and a Peabody Award.
In 2000, "The Times of Harvey Milk" was selected by the Sundance Institute and UCLA Film and Television Archive as a preservation project and for the first time the film was blown-up to 35mm. In 2011, the Criterion Collection released a newly digital re-master Blu-ray edition of "The Times of Harvey Milk" with numerous additional materials, including interviews with Gus Van Sant and others involved in his film "Milk", which was inspired by the documentary.
Late 1980s.
In 1986, Epstein made an early AIDS documentary for PBS with Peter Adair, titled "The AIDS Show", and in 1987, he was a producer/director on a public television series called "We The People". This documentary TV series was the first time he worked with editor Jeffrey Friedman. Their sensibilities and creative styles clicked. In 1987, the two formed Telling Pictures, a San Francisco-based production company and set about on their first collaboration which was the HBO documentary "Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt", inspired by the AIDS Memorial Quilt founded by Cleve Jones. Narrated by Dustin Hoffman, "Common Threads" tells the dramatic story of the first decade of AIDS in America through five stories memorialized in the AIDS Quilt. Epstein won his second Academy Award for Documentary Feature with "Common Threads", as well as another Peabody. Bobby McFerrin receiving an Emmy for his all-vocal original score.
1990s.
Epstein and Friedman's next film was a road-documentary set in the aftermath of the first Persian Gulf War, entitled "Where Are We?", part of the documentary competition line-up at the Sundance Film Festival (1991). 
In 1995, Epstein and Friedman wrote and directed "The Celluloid Closet", based on Vito Russo's landmark book of the same title. Released by Sony Pictures Classics, narrated by Lily Tomlin, the film depicts 100 years of gay and lesbian characters in Hollywood movies. "The Celluloid Closet" premiered at the Venice Film Festival and then went on to the Toronto International Film Festival, the Sundance Film Festival (Grand Jury Freedom of Expression Award), and the Berlin Film Festival (Teddy Award, Best Documentary). For its HBO television presentation Epstein and Friedman won Emmys for directing, as well as a Peabody.
2000s-Present.
Epstein and Friedman's next feature documentary "Paragraph 175" premiered at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival where it won the Grand Jury Prize for Directing, and at the Berlin Film Festival where it won the FIPRESCI (International Film Critics Association Award). 
In preparing to segue into narrative feature directing, Rob Epstein was accepted into the American Film Institute directing internship program where he was placed as a directing intern on Martha Coolidge's film "Rambling Rose".
Epstein and Friedman were invited to be fellows at the Sundance Film Institute Writer's Lab with their project "Howl" about Allen Ginsberg's seminal 1955 poem of the same name. "Howl" opened the 2010 Sundance Film Festival as part of the dramatic competition. Filmed in New York in 14 days, "Howl" stars James Franco and features Jon Hamm, David Strathairn, Jeff Daniels, Mary-Louise Parker, Treat Williams, Alessandro Nivola, and Bob Balaban. "Howl" received the National Board of Review Freedom of Expression Award. It was also part of the official competition at the Berlin Film Festival.
Partnered with Friedman, Epstein's upcoming film is "Lovelace", a biopic about porn star Linda Lovelace, starring Amanda Seyfried (Linda Lovelace), Peter Sarsgaard (Chuck Traynor), and James Franco (Hugh Hefner).
Honors & Professorship.
Epstein is the recipient of numerous other awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and the International Documentary Association's Pioneer Award for his contributions to the field, as well as the Outfest Achievement Award and the Frameline Film Festival Award. Epstein's films have played in festivals, theaters, television, and museums throughout the world. Career retrospectives have been held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, the Taiwan International Documentary Film Festival, and Camerimage in Poland. 
Rob Epstein is a member of the Directors Guild of America and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, where he currently serves on the Board of Governors. He joined the Sundance Film Festival's Board of Trustees in 2013. He has taught in the Graduate Film Program at Tisch School of the Arts at NYU, and is currently a professor in film at California College of the Arts, in San Francisco.
In collaboration with Friedman and writer, Sharon Wood, Epstein released a “how-to” book entitled The Art of Nonfiction Movie Making, helping young documentary filmmakers achieve their cinematic goals. The book was published in 2012.

<doc id="20171419" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20171419" title="Wrapped normal distribution">
Wrapped normal distribution

In probability theory and directional statistics, a wrapped normal distribution is a wrapped probability distribution that results from the "wrapping" of the normal distribution around the unit circle. It finds application in the theory of Brownian motion and is a solution to the heat equation for periodic boundary conditions. It is closely approximated by the von Mises distribution, which, due to its mathematical simplicity and tractability, is the most commonly used distribution in directional statistics.
Definition.
The probability density function of the wrapped normal distribution is
where "μ" and "σ" are the mean and standard deviation of the unwrapped distribution, respectively. Expressing the above density function in terms of the characteristic function of the normal distribution yields:
where formula_3 is the Jacobi theta function, given by
The wrapped normal distribution may also be expressed in terms of the Jacobi triple product:
where formula_7 and formula_8
Moments.
In terms of the circular variable formula_9 the circular moments of the wrapped Normal distribution are the characteristic function of the Normal distribution evaluated at integer arguments:
where formula_11 is some interval of length formula_12. The first moment is then the average value of "z", also known as the mean resultant, or mean resultant vector:
The mean angle is
and the length of the mean resultant is
The circular standard deviation, which is a useful measure of dispersion for the wrapped Normal distribution and its close relative, the von Mises distribution is given by:
Estimation of parameters.
A series of "N" measurements "z""n" = "e" "iθ""n" drawn from a wrapped normal distribution may be used to estimate certain parameters of the distribution. The average of the series is defined as
and its expectation value will be just the first moment:
In other words, is an unbiased estimator of the first moment. If we assume that the mean "μ" lies in the interval [−"π", "π"), then Arg  will be a (biased) estimator of the mean "μ".
Viewing the "z""n" as a set of vectors in the complex plane, the 2 statistic is the square of the length of the averaged vector:
and its expected value is:
In other words, the statistic
will be an unbiased estimator of "e"−"σ"2, and ln(1/"R""e"2) will be a (biased) estimator of "σ"2
Entropy.
The information entropy of the wrapped normal distribution is defined as:
where formula_23 is any interval of length formula_12. Defining formula_25 and formula_26, the Jacobi triple product representation for the wrapped normal is:
where formula_28 is the Euler function. The logarithm of the density of the wrapped normal distribution may be written:
Using the series expansion for the logarithm:
the logarithmic sums may be written as:
so that the logarithm of density of the wrapped normal distribution may be written as:
which is essentially a Fourier series in formula_33. Using the characteristic function representation for the wrapped normal distribution in the left side of the integral:
the entropy may be written:
which may be integrated to yield:

222 Main is Utah’s first LEED Gold-certified high-rise. The structure stands 22 stories high and is located at 222 South Main Street in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was constructed by Hamilton Partners and construction on the building was completed in December 2009. The building was facing serious occupancy issues, with the pre-lease rate remaining at around 25% but rates have since increased, especially with the largely publicized lease announcement of Goldman Sachs.
Atop the building is a glass veil that is illuminated with different colors at various times of the year.
LEED Certification.
Originally, the building was expected to earn LEED Silver certification, but along the way improvements were made and the building ultimately earned LEED Gold certification.
Architect.
The building was designed by architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM.) SOM has also designed buildings such as the Willis Tower, the world's current tallest building - the Burj Khalifa - in the United Arab Emirates, and the Air Force Academy Chapel in Colorado Springs. SOM also designed the One World Trade Center, which is currently being erected where the destroyed World Trade Center once stood. The shape of the building is designed to optimize views between currently standing buildings, includes a parking garage hidden behind the main structure and has of office space with floor to ceiling windows.
Construction.
The building has a price tag of $125 million and took nearly two years to complete. There are a total of 6,257 pieces of structural steel and bracing in the structure and wiring that stretches 201 miles.

Lwamondo

Lwamondo is a village in the Vhembe District Municipality, of Limpopo Province, South Africa. It has been ruled by Vho- Thovhele A. C. Nelwamondo, since 1971.
History.
In comparison with all other Chiefs that came from Dzata, the Nelwamondo compare favourably to the other major chieftaincies of Venda. History indicates that these people used to live in the place called Phadzima, Vhulaudzi. The Singo’s were still based in Dzata at the time, and Nelwamondo was “Murambi wa dzunde” under Chief Thohoyandou.
When Govhamasenga left Dzata towards south, he joined forces with Nelwamondo. When Govhamasenga arrived at Tshinavheni and Vhusenzi, he decided to stop his journey there. Nelwamondo decided to proceed until he arrived much to the east, at the place now called Bushbuckridge, and Lydenburg, where he then lived.
After some time, Nelwamondo and his army then decided to go back, under the leadership of their own Tshilinde, where they settled in the area today called Lwamondo. The royal palace was then built at Makambe, which is on the east of the Lwamondo Mountain. Tshilinde later relocated to Tshamukololo, where he later passed on. His son, Mapungwi then became heir to the throne, and lived there until his passing on. As Vha-Venda say “ Vhuhosi vhu naka muvhango”, even this was contested between Radali and Randuhu (who were both sons of Mapungwi). Nemutandani supported Randuhu as a result, he was assaulted with the bows and arrows, and ran for his survival, together with Randuhu, and found themselves living at Mauluma. This led to Radali rising to the throne.
After the passing of Radali, his son Mathule became the heir. Mathule then relocated to Tshiwedza. When Mathule passed on, Maboho took the throne, and Matshusa became the “ndumi”; Nyakhuhu became “Khadzi”. After a short while, Maboho relocated to Madefule (closer to Tshivhale), where the royal palace relocated to. In the year 1848, white settlers then moved into Thuvhalalwe (Schoemansdall). João Albasini was already in Luonde by 1855, and this made it easy for them to conquer Maboho.
On 22 September 1863, with the assistance of Vhatonga, the white settlers led by Albasini, invaded Maboho Nelwamondo, taking livestock (cattle, sheep and goats). They then forced the Nelwamondos to pay taxes to them. Seeing this, the royal palace then relocated from Madefule to Musanda Mafela, at the throne of the mountain, where the royal palace still is, today. The enemies could be seen from afar.
Maboho used this new set-up to his advantage. When enemies were coming, he would see them from far, and plan for them. His army would roll the rocks down the mountain. 
Albasini’s amy was treated no differently, and was defeated during the day, and ran away. They resorted to coming back at night, when visibility is poor. Even then, their movement at night would awake the baboon, and the Nelwamondo’s would then wake up, and the battle begins (Ya vha yo shoma), and Albasini lost yet again. Albasini invited the “Vhangona vha Mzila”, who liked to take over Lwamondo. They were also defeated. Ligegise Tshivhase, who also envied and admired the Lwamondo Mountain, hired the Swazis, well known as mabunyu (or the naked). They tried, but lost the battle, where they were killed by the rolling stones. 
Mzila also sent another army in April 1869, led by Magidjana, Muyakayaka and Stephanus Schoeman (as they were referred to). After losing, another army was sent, led by Mpisane in June 1869, which was also defeated. 
The victorious Lwamondo people also assisted Mugivhi when he was fighting with Mukhesi. This was because Mugivhi was a son-in-law to the Nelwamondo’s as he married Princess Vele, the daughter of Maboho.
In the year 1883, Maboho passed on, and was succeeded to the throne by Phophi, the grandson of Tshakhuma. At this time, Raidimi asked vha-Dzanani to assist him so to assume the throne. Tshibalo tsha Tshilwavhusiku tsha ha Ramabulana, tsha bva. Phophi then sent Prince Matodzi, with royal gifts of beads (vhulungu ha madi na denga). The livestock followed with Madzunya for reconciliation. Certainly, the spear only killed who was fighting. It was all peace afterwards, until Mukhesi was wanted Nelwamondo to bow to him.
When this got to Makhado’s ears, Makhado insisted that he would not want Nelwamondo to come to him via anyone. Nelwamondo should have a direct connection to his chieftaincy, so should Mukhesi. Then it was all peace.
In 1895, Makhado passed on. In 1896 there was famine (Ndala ya Matshona) due to locusts that ate the crops. In the year 1898, the Mphephu’s fought with the Boers. Phopi fought, and refused Lwamondo to be invaded. He said, it is to be invaded, it should only be of the battle is fought and lost. Then another battle began. When the war was over, Phophi, Ravele, Matidze and Ratombo were arrested with other 16 chiefs, and were yoked together and were forced to pull the boer’s cart (Tshirululu) from Venda to Bulugwane (Polokwane). They were then sent to a jail in Pretoria.
Phophi ruled for a long time, and it was him who began a number of schools in Lwamondo. After he passed on, Mugaguli assumed the throne, taking the job of his father forward. He became a member of the Regional and Territorial Authorities. He passed on 6 July 1970.
On 11 December 1971, Mugaguli’s son, Aifheli assumed the throne. He was given instructions to rule Lwamondo, and he was then given the throne name: Ndaedzo. Ntshavheni Alfred Nelwamondo became ndumi. Chief Ndaedzo then became a member of the Regional Authorities. Chief Ndaedzo Nelwamondo became the speaker of parliament. When Venda was given independence, he became a minister in several portfolios. Development continued in Lwamondo, schools were built, a clinic and electricity, and running water.
"Ndi vha Nyambado I no rema thavha ya Lwamondo, ngeno ya vhanwe I tshirema basha. Hu aniwa nga matshele na nyambado. Nwana a losha vhari, dzulani zwanu Kwinda Rambado, Mulaudzi wa ha Nyambado. Vho mme vha tshi vhidza vhana vhari idani ngeno Mphwambado!"

Cecil Beresford Ramage

Cecil Beresford Ramage, MC (17 January 1895 – 22 February 1988) was a British barrister, actor and Liberal politician.
Life.
Following his education at the Edinburgh Academy, Ramage was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Scots at the outbreak of World War I. He served in Gallipoli, Palestine and Egypt and was awarded the Military Cross.
Following the war, he went up to Pembroke College, Oxford, where he became President of the Oxford Union. At Oxford he first took to the stage, appearing in "Antony and Cleopatra" with Cathleen Nesbitt, whom he married in 1920. They had two children. Instead of taking up acting as a profession after university, Ramage read law. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, and practised on the Oxford Circuit.
At the 1922 general election he was the Liberal candidate for the constituency of Newcastle West, but was defeated by David Adams of the Labour Party. Another election was held in 1923 and Ramage stood again and was elected as Member of Parliament (MP). He was only to be in the Commons for a short period, as he was defeated at the subsequent general election in 1924. He was the Liberal candidate at Southport at the 1929 general election, but failed to be elected.
By this time Ramage was a professional actor, appearing in New York, the West End of London and toured with the Old Vic Company in the Mediterranean. He had a number of minor roles in films, including "Secret of Stamboul" (1936), "Nicholas Nickleby" (1947) and "Kind Hearts and Coronets" (1949).
His career eventually declined, and he retired from the stage and was separated from his wife, Nesbitt, who died in 1982, aged 93. He played the Crown Counsel in "Kind Hearts and Coronets", whose devastating cross-examination of Louis Mazzini does much to discredit him.
Death.
Cecil Beresford Ramage died in 1988, aged 93.

Waki Commission

The Waki Commission, officially The Commission of Inquiry on Post Election Violence (CIPEV), was an international commission of inquiry established by the Government of Kenya in February 2008 to investigate the clashes in Kenya following the disputed Kenyan presidential election of 2007.
Background.
The Kenyan presidential election of 2007 was held in December 2007. The main contenders were incumbent President of Kenya, Mwai Kibaki and his former ally Raila Odinga. The election was strongly marked by tribalism, with Kibaki coming from the most numerous Kikuyu ethnic group which has dominated Kenyan politics since independence and Odinga an ethnic Luo allied with other smaller ethnic groups. Kibaki was declared the winner and sworn in on 30 December, despite opposition leader Raila Odinga's claims of victory. Odinga and many international observers claimed the elections were at least partially manipulated. Following the declaration, violent protests erupted particularly in Kibera, and this included ethnic violence targeted against Kikuyu people living outside their traditional settlement areas, especially in the Rift Valley Province. Luos and Kalenjin were also targeted in the areas surrounding Nakuru and Naivasha.
Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan brokered a power-sharing agreement which included the appointment of the Waki Commission to investigate the violence.
Composition.
The chairman of the Commission was Justice Philip Waki, a Judge of Kenya's Court of Appeal. The other two commission members were Gavin Alistair McFadyen, a former police Assistant Commissioner in New Zealand and Pascal K. Kambale, a lawyer from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who was working on the Open Society Institute's Africa Governance, Monitoring and Advocacy Project. The Secretary to the Commission was George Mong’are Kegoro, an advocate of the High Court of Kenya and Kenyan Section Director of the International Commission of Jurists. The Assisting Counsel was David Shikomera Majanja, an advocate of the High Court of Kenya.
Report.
The post-election violence report by Waki Commission, commonly known as the "Waki report", was handed over to president Mwai Kibaki and prime minister Raila Odinga on 15 October 2008. The report has 529 pages. The report however did not publicly disclose the alleged perpetrators in the report handed to the President. The Waki Commission instead handed the list of alleged perpetrators to Kofi Annan. In July 2009 Koffi Annan handed the envelope to Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the Prosecutor at the ICC. The Kenyan Government was then given 1-year, beginning July 2009, to set up a Tribunal to deal with issue. Failure to do this would see the ICC would pick up the matter beginning August 2010. Daily Nation, 13, 20 July
Cost.
In response to a query by Joseph Lekuton, on 16 December 2008, Orwa Ojode the Assistant Minister for Provincial Administration and Internal Security confirmed to parliament that the commission had cost Kshs 7,635,694 with the Kenya Government contributing Kshs 5,951,930 and donors contributing Kshs 1,683,764.

Eddie Windass

Edward "Eddie" Windass is a fictional character in the UK television ITV soap opera "Coronation Street". Portrayed by actor Steve Huison, the character first appeared on screen during the episode airing on 14 November 2008. On 5 December 2010, it was announced that Eddie is to leave Coronation Street in spring 2011 after being axed by producer Phil Collinson. Huison made his final appearance as Eddie on 25 April 2011. This was Huison's second role in the soap, he previously played criminal Andy Morgan in 2003.
Creation.
Background.
The character of Eddie was created as part of a new family unit that new producer Kim Crowther introduced to the soap opera, consisting of a mother, father, son and uncle. They were originally billed as a storyline device for established character David Platt. An ITV spokesperson said of the character and her onscreen family: "The Windass family are very rough and ready, always ducking and diving. Early on they get involved with David Platt when he helps to fit a new kitchen in the Windass family home. However, Anna thinks the work is shoddy and refuses to pay for it. David goes round, rips out the kitchen and sets fire to it outside the family’s house." Fellow cast member Debbie Rush spoke about their odd surname and stated they were expecting comments when seen in public about it. Producers also revealed that they had high hopes for the family compared to what happened to Number 6's previous tenants The Mortons.
Development.
Personality and identity.
Speaking of his character Huison said: “Eddie’s a great character to play, he thinks he’s hard and head of the family, but he’s always one step behind Gary and Len. Eddie is always up to silly scams. He uses crutches but you may notice he doesn’t always limp with the same leg…” 
Storylines.
The character's storylines start immediately after his first onscreen appearance when David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) and his boss Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale) confront him and his family about a bounced cheque that they had used to pay for their fitted kitchen. Several weeks later, the Windasses move into Coronation Street after renting number 6 from Jerry Morton (Michael Starke). After Anna nags him to find employment, Eddie gets a job as a taxi driver at "Streetcars", but is reluctant to hand over any paperwork to Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), due to fiddling Incapacity Benefit.
Eddie plans to start up a darts team, but once he collects the money from the team, he tells them he has been mugged and lost the money. Anna is disgusted and accuses him of going back to his old scheming ways., Eddie's plan backfires when Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment) approaches him a few days later, telling him that he has spoken to everyone and they have agreed to keep the team going, since it means so much to Eddie. The Rovers' team consists of "Dark Destroyer" Eddie, Kirk, Kevin (Michael Le Vell) and Bill Webster (Peter Armitage), Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) and Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles). Eddie's ruse is uncovered when a visiting darts team arrive at the Rover's to play against his team. The rival team's captain recognises him as Eddie had tried a similar scam two years before and the team chase him.
In May 2009, Eddie overhears Roy Cropper (David Neilson) giving employee Anna the "Roy's Rolls" password and account number for the Cash 'n' Carry. He deviously takes the details from Anna's handbag and buys alcohol under the pretence that he is working for Roy. He is the Cash 'n' Carry's millionth customer and wins a city break to Europe. He tells Anna that he is taking her away for a romantic break and that he has been putting money aside to pay for it. However, Eddie's scam is exposed when Roy's wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) sees a cardboard cut of Eddie as the millionth customer at the Cash n' Carry. Eddie is then banned from the Cafe by his wife. In July 2009, it is revealed that Eddie and Anna are not in fact married, as he proposes to her. She rejects him and it becomes clear that he has proposed many times previously.
Eddie and Anna deal with son Gary for most of 2009. He goes to prison after a robbery setup, orchestrated by David Platt, and after his release, becomes interested in joining the army. Eddie is reluctant to show emotion but bakes a cake to show Gary how proud he is. Several months later, Gary goes AWOL after a friend loses limbs in battle. Eventually Eddie calls the military police and tells them Gary is at home, because he feels his son needs to face up to his responsibilities. When Gary is away from home, Anna begins keeping an eye on Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) when he's having family problems. Anna decides she wants to adopt a child, and warms Eddie to the idea. They begin a competition with Steve and Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly), who also want to adopt.
In early 2011 Eddie and Anna begin fostering nine year-old Faye Butler (Ellie Leach). Faye proves to be a handful for the Windasses as she doesn't take to her new home right away, her presence leads to tension between the couple and Eddie reveals he never wanted to adopt. Eddie pleads with Anna to send Faye back, but Anna refuses to give up on her. When Len offers Eddie a job in Germany, he gives Anna an ultimatum to choose between him or Faye. Anna is appalled Eddie has placed her in such a position, and tells him that given the choice, she'd choose Faye every time. With this, the couple end their relationship and Eddie packs his bags before saying goodbye to Gary and leaving for Germany.
Reception.
Grace Dent of The Guardian slated the character because of his scrounging ways and shoddy appearance stating: "Gary's dad Eddie has no positive attributes to speak of. None. He's six feet tall with a collapsed orange Sideshow Bob hairdo and an ambidextrous limp which switches from left to right leg depending on which Social Security officer is spying on him. He has a permanently fuddled expression which could be down to Temazepam, plain idiocy or the fact all his good brain cells are engaged in working out how to rob your wallet." Tony Stewart of The Mirror also describes Eddie's character as a scrounger. MSN branded Eddie and his family as chavs and being perfect guests for the Jeremy Kyle show, and going onto to calling them a million miles away from lower class yobbish families 'The Mortons' and 'The Battersbys'. Whereas Simon Swift of Soaplife magazine commented on the fact that on first looks he couldn't help feeling that Eddie and his clan are a bit too much like original neighbours-from-hell the Battersbys. Ben Ashford of The Sun newspaper compared the real life fraud crimes of The Peters family, who came up with a range of illnesses including agoraphobia and alcoholism to swindle state handouts, as that mirroring Eddie and his onscreen family branding both units as 'scroungers'. Kris Green of media website Digital Spy praised and commented on the fact that the Windass clan had 'settled in so well, in such a short space of time', with fellow actor Mikey North stating that their success is down to the good writing and many plotlines the family received in the short time period.
Upon the airing of Eddie's final episodes in April 2011, Jane Simon of The Daily Mirror wrote that she is "gutted" to see the character depart the show and adds that she hopes "the "Corrie" bosses see sense and decide to glue the Windass family back together before too long".

L&amp;YR Hughes 4-6-4T

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Hughes 4-6-4T was a class of steam locomotives. They were a 4-6-4T tank engine version of the L&YR Class 8 ("Dreadnought" Class 4-6-0), hence they were known as "Dreadnought tanks".
Construction.
All were actually built by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1924 after the grouping, albeit at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Horwich Works.
Numbering.
They had been allocated L&Y numbers 1684–1693, but these were never carried and there was no L&YR class number. The LMS gave them the numbers 11110–11119, and the power classification 5P.
Orders modified or cancelled.
Another 20 of this class were ordered but turned out as further examples of the L&YR Class 8. Orders for an additional 30 were cancelled. Like the Class 8s on which they were based, they were not particularly successful.
Withdrawal.
Withdrawals started in 1938, with three engines (11112, 11115, 11116), one each in 1939 and 1940 (11113 and 11111 respectively), four in 1941 (11114, 11117–11119) and the last (11110) in 1942. None was preserved.

Anna Windass

Anna Windass is a fictional character in the UK television ITV soap opera, "Coronation Street". Portrayed by Debbie Rush, the character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 14 November 2008. Anna's storylines have included a rocky relationship to her boyfriend, Eddie Windass (Steve Huison), a feud with the Platt family, coping with her wayward son Gary (Mikey North), dealing with the fact that Gary has decided to go in the army, a relationship with Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), adopting Faye Butler (Ellie Leach), a feud with Faye's biological father Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) and his partner Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor), getting into trouble with Social Services after Faye tells her school that Anna has been "abusing" her and helping close friend Roy Cropper (David Neilson) cope after discovering that his wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) is dying.
Creation and casting.
The character of Anna was created as part of a new family unit that new producer Kim Crowther was introducing to the soap opera, consisting of a mother, father, son and uncle. They were originally billed as a storyline device for established character David Platt. An ITV spokesperson said of the character and her onscreen family: "The Windass family are very rough and ready, always ducking and diving. Early on they get involved with David Platt when he helps to fit a new kitchen in the Windass family home. However, Anna thinks the work is shoddy and refuses to pay for it. David goes round, rips out the kitchen and sets fire to it outside the family’s house." Rush said of their entrance and choice of surname for the family: "The Windasses are a very close family, who are just about on the wrong side of the law, but they mean well. And yes, I am prepared for some of the things people might shout at me in the street because of the name!" The character was originally called "Donna Windass" but was changed last minute to "Anna Windass" after a series of name changes to all the members of the family since their inception, but before appearing onscreen.
Auditions were held for the part of Anna, with actress Debbie Rush going on to get the part over a number of highly-rated actors. Of this Rush said: "I went for the casting a few months ago and then was called back for the screen test. When I got the part I couldn’t believe it, I was thrilled to bits. I watched Corrie all the time growing up and all the family are tuning in now that I’m going to be in it. It’s surreal, because the cast and characters are already part of your life just from watching it."
Character development.
The character of Anna has been seen to differ from the rest of her family in terms of personality traits that are not present in the others. This is because she does not approve of the continuous line of scams her husband pulls, as well as the life of crime Len and Gary indulge in. Anna is often described as the only nice Windass.
Storylines.
Anna first appears onscreen with her boyfriend Eddie (Steve Huison) when they are involved in a storyline in which they refuse to pay Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale) for a kitchen refit, which then sees David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) trying to force them to pay up, after they won't he makes a series of threats, which results in David, Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) and Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey) setting fire to the Windasses' kitchen. In a storyline which would cement the feud between the Platt and Windass families, the characters are introduced to the helm of the show, on 8 December 2008, Anna moves into Number 6 Coronation Street with the rest of her family. She has a heart-to-heart with new neighbour Gail Platt (Helen Worth) in order to make peace as she wants a fresh start in Coronation Street even though the rest of their families are feuding and convinces Eddie to make peace with Gail's partner Joe. This ends badly at Christmas, as Gail's invitation for the Windasses to stop in for dinner soon leads to Joe throwing food at them and forcing them out of the house. 
As the New Year begins, Anna is dismayed as she senses Eddie sinking back into his con artist ways and she always objects to them as her character shows her desire to live a free life without having to steal and scrounge money from society, and as the feud between her son Gary (Mikey North) and David Platt grows more volatile. 
In March 2009, she is relieved when Gary is cleared of assaulting David two months previously, during the period before the trial, Anna is seen making a series of attempts to influence characters Gail and Tina into making David change his mind about the charges. She is also seen breaking down on number of occasions trying to hold her family together.
In April 2009, Roy Cropper (David Neilson) gives Anna a job working in the cafe. Initially his wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) is skeptical but is impressed by Anna's work ethic and she continues working there. Hayley also takes Anna's side when Eddie steals and poses as Roy in a scam to receive free alcohol from the cash-and-carry.
Anna is dismayed in 2010 when Gary decides that he wants to join the Army. Fearing for his life on the frontline, she eventually comes to terms with his career decision. However, Anna is later dismayed when Gary is reported as being AWOL, after she comforts him over his secret fears he returns to duty.
2010 also sees Anna and Eddie looking into adopting a child. They both attend meetings to do with adopting (which Becky (Katherine Kelly) and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) also go to) and have a meeting with a social worker at their home. Anna's brother's son Rory comes to stay while his parents went on holiday, Eddie is seen pushing Rory round in a pram, which makes Becky very upset that Anna and Eddie have been given a child while her and Steve have not. It is later revealed that Rory is Anna's nephew after a heated debate with the social worker.
In early 2011, young Faye Butler (Ellie Leach) comes to stay with Anna and Eddie, with a view towards them both becoming her foster parents. Faye is quite a troubled young girl and this causes a rift to form between Anna and Eddie as he becomes discouraged with fostering. Anna is adamant that she will support Faye, particularly after her biological mother is found dead following a drug overdose. Eddie breaks the tragic news in quite a clumsy way to Faye and this angers Anna a great deal. Eventually, Eddie issues Anna with an ultimatum, to choose between him and Faye. Anna chooses Faye and Eddie moves to Germany as a result.
After Eddie's departure, Anna forges a close friendship with builder Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), whose daughter Izzy (Cherylee Houston) is dating Gary. Anna is dismayed when she discovers that her landlord Jerry Morton (Michael Starke) is planning on selling No. 6. Unable to afford buying the house, she is worried as Faye has finally found stability in her new home. Owen, much to Anna's surprise, buys the house and becomes her new landlord. This brings them closer together, much to Faye's jealousy as she fears that Owen will take Anna away from her. Their relationship goes well, and Anna supports Owen after he discovers his sixteen year old daughter Katy (Georgia May Foote) is pregnant and later helps her give birth to her son Joseph on Christmas Eve 2011. Owen and Anna's relationship is later tested, after Anna goes away to visit her ill brother; Owen looks after Faye, and after discovering that Faye had poisoned the fish he had bought for Anna's garden, slapped her. Faye locked herself in her room, and upon Anna's return - the couple split, with Anna unable to forgive Owen for hitting Faye. Anna's son Gary and Owen's daughter Izzy later discover that Izzy is pregnant, the pair are overjoyed but Izzy later miscarries. Due to her disability, they approach Izzy's younger sister Katy about being a surrogate mother for them, and whilst supporting Gary though the ordeal - she and Owen get back together properly, after months of being on/off. Izzy later decides she cannot put her sister through the ordeal and Owen enlists his employee Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) to become the surrogate, and the family discover that the implantation has worked and Tina is pregnant in December 2012.
Anna is stunned to learn that Gary has developed a crush on Tina after discovering he spent £200 on her late father's wedding ring at a pawn shop after it was stolen. Anna keeps this a secret, but Gary takes things too far when he tries to kiss Tina, but she rejects him. Izzy learns of this and Tina goes into premature labour. Tina gives birth to Gary and Izzy's baby son, "Jake", but Izzy does not want Gary to see him because of his betrayal. After witnessing Gary and Izzy's unstable relationship, Tina decides she wants to keep the baby and raise him with her boyfriend, Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain). This leads to Anna insulting Tina on numerous occasions. When Gary confides in Anna about how long a court battle could take to get the baby back, Anna storms into The Rovers and slaps a shocked Tina for taking "Jake", renamed Joe. Izzy and Gary are terrified that Tina will report Anna to Social Services, but she doesn't. Later, Izzy and Gary decide to give Joe up to Tina because they find it unfair how he is being treated like this.
Anna is also stressed when Faye decides to go and live with her biological father, Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine). When Anna bans Faye from seeing Tim, she lies to school headmaster Brian Packham (Peter Gunn), telling him that Anna beats her at home. Social workers Nicola Waite (Maxine Burth) and Stephen Bowyer (Dana Haqjoo) arrive to question Anna, and they then question Faye, who reveals that Anna has never hit her. Anna then allows Faye to move in with Tim, but this causes an emotional Anna to break down in Owen's arms. When Tim goes on a trip to Newcastle to continue with his work, Faye tells him that she will be stopping with Anna and Owen, but she instead stops at Tim's flat on her own. Faye is later caught stealing at Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop by Mary Taylor (Patti Clare) and Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent). Mary and Sophie reveal this to Owen, who tells Anna. Anna feeds a starving Faye and gives her a shower, before angrily confronting Tim on his doorstep about leaving Faye home alone. Tim begins a relationship with Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor), causing friction between her and Anna. Anna is annoyed when Tim and Sally are constantly buying new things that impress Faye. Sally decides to have a garden party on the same day that Anna is planning on having a barbecue, which leads to further friction and the guests being torn on which barbecue to attend, especially Roy and Hayley, as Sally is a close friend and Anna is their employee. When Anna runs out of tomato ketchup, she uses Sally's without permission, leading to a physical fight as Anna is on one side of the fence and Sally is on the other. The fight ends in disaster, however, when Sally and Anna go flying into Anna's back garden with the fence, smashed up and ruined.
Anna helps out at the Croppers' upon discovering that Hayley has been diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer. A few months later, Hayley collapses at home and is rushed to hospital. Anna does her best to look out for Roy but he accidentally spills the beans on Hayley's suicide wish, leaving Anna stunned. Roy is extremely guilty that he has confided in Anna about Hayley's privacy, and orders her not to say anything to anybody about it. When Roy is decorating his and Hayley's bedroom, Anna gets Owen and Gary to decorate it for him, so Roy is free to do as he likes. When Hayley returns home from hospital, she reveals to Anna that she does not like the wallpaper, but will pretend to for Roy's sake. Later that evening, Roy bumps into Anna on the street and tells her that he has told Hayley that he is fine with her suicide wish. He reveals to Anna that he feels he has lied to Hayley and betrayed her, and Anna does her best to comfort him.
Anna is weary when Faye brings her new friend Grace Piper (Ella-Grace Gregoire) home for tea. Grace seems lovely, and Anna falls her tactics when it is revealed that Grace is in fact a manipulative girl who uses Faye in her dangerous games. Grace and Faye cause havoc all over Coronation Street, but it isn't until the pair attack Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) that Anna loses her temper with Faye. After Simon's stepmother Leanne Tilsley (Jane Danson) has confronted Faye, Anna asks for the truth, but Faye keeps on telling her that she and Grace haven't done anything wrong. That night, Grace sends Faye a video of her attacking Simon, and it soon goes viral after she posts it onto the internet. Mary, another victim of Grace and Faye's, sees the video first, and shows it to Simon's carer Tina. The video travels around the street, disguting most of the residents. Simon is refusing to leave the house because he is so embarrassed that he was attacked by girls. Soon, Simon's headmaster Brian Packham (Peter Gunn) gets wind of what has happened to him and goes round to the Windass household, where he tells a terrified Faye that he will have to inform to police. A few days later, Anna and Owen accompany Faye to the police station and they see Grace with her mother, who clashes with Anna. When Faye is questioned, she tells the detective that Grace has been blackmailing her, saying that if she grasses her up, she will make sure that nobody at her school will like her. Anna is proud of Faye for her bravery.
Into the New Year, Anna supports Roy as Hayley's health deteriorates. On 20 January 2014, Anna decides to close the café early, after having a bad feeling about Hayley and Roy's situation all day. A few minutes later, Hayley's former boss Carla Connor (Alison King) arrives at the café and Anna answers the door. Carla also admits that she has had a bad feeling about the situation over the past few days. Carla then demands to see Hayley, but Anna tries to persuade her against the idea, thinking that leaving the couple alone would be the better choice. After giving in, Anna enters the café flat with Carla after using her spare set of keys, but to their shock, they find a deceased Hayley on the bed with Roy's arm around her. Anna sees the glass on Hayley's bedside cabinet and realizes that she had taken an overdose, and washes the glass up for them. Carla witnesses Anna washing up the glass and also guesses that Hayley committed suicide. Anna then walks into The Rovers and reveals to the devastated regulars that Hayley has passed away. The following week, Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine), who was the Croppers' foster child a few years ago, learns the horrible truth about Hayley's death and shouts at Roy, storming out of the café. Anna then finds Fiz and explains that it was what Hayley wanted and that it was not assisted suicide.
Reception.
Kris Green of media website Digital Spy commented that Anna and the Windass family had 'settled in so well, in such a short space of time'. Actor Mikey North attributed their success as characters to a combination of good writing and prominent plotlines received in a relatively short time period. Ben Ashford of The Sun newspaper compared the Windass family to the real life fraudsters the Peters family, who claimed a range of illnesses including agoraphobia and alcoholism and swindled state handouts, branding both families 'scroungers'. 
Grace Dent of The Guardian has said that she likes the character of Anna, pointing out her redeeming personality traits: "Chief apologist for all of these people is Anna Windass, Eddie's wife and Gary's mum, who is so surprisingly sweet and non-abrasive that she manages to keep her entire clan on the right side of likable just through hapless handwringing alone." going onto say "I rather like Anna, although Gail Platt isn't a fan. I was expecting another Cilla Battersby, but instead she's more Emily Bishop in a sea-green velour fake Juicy Couture and Asda slippers. Anna knows that, children-wise, her and Gail have lots in common and they'd work better as a team than at war." Tony Stewart of The Mirror also describes Anna's character as a scrounger. MSN branded Anna and her family as chavs and suggested they would make the perfect guests for the Jeremy Kyle show. Simon Swift of Soaplife magazine stated that at first, he couldn't help feeling that Anna and her clan are a bit too much like original neighbours-from-hell the Battersbys.
In 2009 Ruth Deller of entertainment website "Lowculture" who runs a monthly feature of the most popular and unpopular soap opera characters, profiled the Windasses, adding that Anna is the main reason to why they were initially unpopular, stating: "The Windass family’s introduction has not gone down too well, and Donna "(sic)" seems to be the prime target for the vitriol against them. Perhaps they can be redeemed a la the Jacksons in EE or the Timminses in Neighbours, or perhaps they’ll just leave…" Kate White from "Inside Soap" said that Anna and Owen were a "great match". She could not understand why Anna could not just forgive Owen because she had with all of Eddie's crimes.

William Moor

William Moor (died 1765) was an English sailor and explorer associated with the Hudson’s Bay Company and the annual supply ships to the bay area.
Life.
Moor was involved, under the supervision of his cousin, Christopher Middleton, with voyages to the bay from about 1730 to 1741 and carried out increasingly important duties during that period. In 1741 he and Middleton left the HBC's employ and Moor was given command of the "Discovery" to aid his cousin in the "Furnace" in a search for the northwest passage. They overwintered at Prince of Wales Fort where sickness plagued the crews. Their survey of the shoreline and tides of the west side of Hudson Bay was not particularly successful.
Moor and Middleton and the 1741-1742 expedition were under the scrutiny of Arthur Dobbs, an opponent of the HBC monopoly of the bay area. Middleton was accused of protecting the HBC monopoly and Moor took the side of Dobbs. In 1746, Moor was in command of a private discovery expedition to Hudson Bay funded by Dobbs and others. After a short and unsuccessful period of exploration by the two ships, they decided to overwinter at the HBC post at York Factory. (Man.)
The next summer some good exploration was carried out on the western shore and discovered Chesterfield Inlet but did not fully explore it. He also examined Rankin Inlet and Wager Bay. At a point, after further exploration, illness and threats of mutiny turned the expedition for home.
Moor’s competence as a commander was called into question on his return. There is little doubt that his weakness and uncertainty affected the expedition but the unhappiness of the investors was also because he refused to engage in illegal trade on their behalf.
Moor appears to have retired around this time. His explorations did add significantly to the knowledge of the area despite his problems with the command of the expedition.

Aut dedere aut judicare

In law, the principle of aut dedere aut judicare (Latin for "extradite or prosecute") refers to the legal obligation of states under public international law to prosecute persons who commit serious international crimes where no other state has requested extradition. This obligation arises regardless of the extraterritorial nature of the crime and regardless of the fact that the perpetrator and victim may be of alien nationality.
The rationale for this principle is to ensure that there are no jurisdictional gaps in the prosecution of internationally committed crimes. It is, however, unusual for States to be required to exercise this jurisdiction because often another State party will have an interest in the matter and will apply for extradition. In this situation that State will have priority.
Some contemporary scholars hold the opinion that "aut dedere aut judicare" is not an obligation under customary international law but rather “a specific conventional clause relating to specific crimes” and, accordingly, an obligation that only exists when a state has voluntarily assumed the obligation. Cherif Bassiouni, however, has posited that, at least with regard to international crimes, it is not only a rule of customary international law but a jus cogens principle. Professor Michael Kelly, moreover, citing Israeli and Austrian judicial decisions, has noted that “there is some supporting anecdotal evidence that judges within national systems are beginning to apply the doctrine on their own.” 
A wide array of international instruments now contain provisions for "aut dedere aut judicare". These include all four 1949 Geneva Conventions,113 the UN Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, the UN Convention Against Corruption, the Convention for the Suppression of the Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of an Armed Conflict, and the International Convention for the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.
Typical offences.
Typically offences classified as falling under the "aut dedere aut judicare" principle include:
Multilateral treaties.
The majority of these offences rely on multilateral treaties to extend the "prosecute or extradite" principle to them. This method of granting jurisdiction has become increasingly common since World War II. Jurisdiction granting treaties include:

<doc id="20171593" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20171593" title="Leopard complex">
Leopard complex

The leopard complex is a group of genetically-related coat patterns in horses. These patterns range from progressive increases in interspersed white hair similar to graying or roan to distinctive, Dalmatian-like leopard spots on a white coat. Secondary characteristics associated with the leopard complex include a white sclera around the eye, striped hooves and mottled skin. The leopard complex genes are also linked to abnormalities in the eyes and vision. These patterns are most closely identified with the Appaloosa horse breed, though its presence in breeds from Asia to western Europe has indicated that it is due to a very ancient mutation.
Leopard complex patterns.
Coat patterns in the leopard complex range from being hardly distinguishable from an unaffected coat, to nearly pure white. Unlike most other spotting patterns, the spotting and especially the white regions associated with the leopard complex tend to be symmetrical and originate over the hips. Furthermore, a certain amount of this inherited white patterning is present at birth. The amount of white, even if none is present at birth, often grows throughout the horse's life by gradual "roaning" which is not related to graying or true roan. Colored spots reflect the underlying coat color, be it black, chestnut, gray, or silver dun-buckskin. A number of factors, each separately, genetically controlled, interact to produce familiar patterns such as "snowflake," "leopard," and "fewspot".
Leopard spotting.
A single, incomplete dominant gene ("Lp") controls the presence of leopard-spotting in horses. A dominant gene requires only a single copy to produce an affected phenotype; an incomplete dominant gene produces a different result depending on whether one or two copies are present. A horse's genotype may be "lp/lp" (homozygous recessive), "Lp/lp" (heterozygous), or "Lp/Lp" (homozygous dominant). Horses without a dominant "Lp" gene do not exhibit leopard-complex traits, and cannot produce offspring with the "Lp" gene unless it is contributed by the other parent. Such horses are termed "non-characteristic" among Appaloosa horse aficionados. Horses with at least one "Lp" gene possess, at the very least, leopard-complex "characteristics":
The presence of regions of alternating pigmented and unpigmented skin may not definitively suggest the leopard gene. They may not be visible due to the effects of other genes. For example, extensive white markings on the face may mask the presence of mottling around the eyes and muzzle, and white markings on the legs often end in white hooves. Furthermore, other genes may produce similar conditions: white sclera are associated with broad white face markings, striped hooves with the Silver dapple gene, and freckled skin with the Champagne gene.
A DNA test can now identify the "Lp" gene, though a combination of pedigree knowledge and coat characteristics also help.
While both heterozygous and homozygous "Lp" horses possess the aforementioned characteristics, heterozygotes and homozygotes differ significantly in the presence of true spots. True leopard spots are produced only by the "Lp" gene, and directly reflect the underlying coat color (bay, black, gray, cremello, red dun, and so on). Since these spots match the coat color, they are not visible unless the surrounding pigment is removed. As a rule, heterozygous leopards have larger, more abundant spots, while homozygotes have smaller, scarcer spots.
White patterning.
There is at least one genetically-controlled type of white patterning that is strictly associated with the leopard complex. These white patterns permit the spots associated with the leopard complex to become visible. Other white patterns, such as tobiano or white leg markings, obscure leopard spots. A certain amount of leopard-associated white patterning may be present at birth. Temporal changes in the amount of white patterning are discussed below. Leopard-associated white patterning is usually symmetrical and originates over the hips. A proposed gene, "PATN-1", may be responsible for the most familiar expressions of white: heterozygotes possessing common-size "blankets" and homozygotes possessing extensive "blankets" that may affect the entire coat. Even horses with extensive white usually retain dark colored regions just above the hooves, on the knees and hocks, stifles and elbows, hips and points of shoulder, the tail, mane, and the bony parts of the face. The smallest amount of white patterning is just a sprinkling of white over the hips.
Leopard-associated roaning.
Just as there is white patterning specifically associated with the leopard complex, there is a type of progressive roaning that is unrelated to graying out or true roan. Horses with coat patterns within the leopard complex are known for their mystifying coat changes. This unusual characteristic is due at least in part to leopard roaning, also called "varnish roaning." While the gray gene only affects the hair, some horses with the "Lp" gene will progressively lose pigment in both the skin and hair as they age. Also unlike graying out, the leopard spots are not affected by this roaning process. Neither are the "bony prominences" strongly affected. As a varnish roan horse lightens, the leopard spots indistinguishable from the rest of the coat become visible. Some horses without any dense white patterning at birth seem to spontaneously develop into white, leopard-spotted horses with maturity. Varnishing is more common among Appaloosa horses, and less common among Norikers and Knabstruppers, whose breed associations find it undesirable.
Interactions and terminology.
Like much of coat color genetics, commonly used terms do not necessarily correspond to precise genetic states. Nevertheless, terminology can reveal a lot about the genetic interactions surrounding the leopard complex. 
Patterns.
Base colors are overlain by various spotting patterns, which are variable and often do not fit neatly into a specific category. These patterns are described as follows:
<onlyinclude>
</onlyinclude>
The "Lp" gene.
Although the spotting and roaning patterns that make up the leopard complex sometimes appear very different from each other, the ability of leopard-spotted horses to produce the full spectrum of patterns, from mottled skin to roaning to more leopard-spotted offspring, has long suggested that a single gene was responsible. This gene was termed "Lp" for "leopard complex" by Dr. D. Phillip Sponenberg in 1982, and was described as an autosomal, incomplete dominant gene. Horses without the gene ("lplp") were solid-colored, those with two copies of the gene (homozygous or "LpLp") were usually "fewspots", while those with a single copy of the gene (heterozygous or "Lplp") ranged from mere mottled skin to full leopard.
In 2004, "Lp" was assigned to equine chromosome 1 (ECA1) by a team of researchers. Four years later, this team mapped the "Lp" gene to a transient receptor potential channel gene, TRPM1 or Melastatin 1 (MLSN1). As yet, the etiology of this condition remains poorly understood.
In 2011, it was announced that an allele associated with "Lp" was identified in DNA samples collected from prehistoric horses. This finding represents evidence for the presence of leopard complex spotting in prehistoric wild horse populations. The ancient origin of the allele may explain the presence of spotted horse paintings in paleolithic cave art.
Vision issues.
Congenital stationary night blindness is an ophthalmologic disorder in horses which is present at birth (congenital), non-progressive (stationary) and affects the animal's vision in conditions of low lighting. Horses with CSNB may be hesitant to enter dimly-lit places - such as indoor arenas, dark stalls, or trailers - and be apprehensive when in such conditions, which may interfere with handling or riding. CSNB is usually diagnosed based on the owner's observations, but some horses have visibly abnormal eyes: poorly aligned eyes (dorsomedial strabismus) or involuntary eye movement (nystagmus). The condition can be confirmed using electroretinography, from which a "negative ERG" indicates CSNB. While the retina is a normal shape, the nerve signal triggered when light reaches rod cells does not reach the brain. Rod cells in the retina are connected to bipolar cells, which transmit the nerve impulse to the next set of neurons. It is thought that these cells fail to undergo the basic chemical reaction for nerve impulse transmission, which involves shuttling of calcium (Ca2+). 
Congenital stationary night blindness has been linked with the leopard complex since the 1970s. The presence of CSNB in non-leopard breeds and horses suggested that the two conditions might be located on close, but separate genes. However, one study used ERG findings to diagnose all the homozygous "Lp" subjects with CSNB, while all heterozygotes and non-"Lp" horses were free from the disorder. The gene to which "Lp" has now been localized encodes a protein that channels calcium ions, a key factor in the transmission of nerve impulses. This protein, which is found in the retina and the skin, existed in fractional percentages of the normal levels in homozygous "Lp/Lp" horses. A 2008 study theorizes that both CSNB and leopard complex spotting patterns are linked to the TRPM1 gene.
Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) is also present in the breed. Appaloosas have an eightfold greater risk of developing Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25% of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Up to 80% of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas, with physical characteristics including light colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting more at-risk individuals. Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease.
Prevalence.
The Appaloosa horse is the breed best known for the leopard complex patterns, though the complex characterizes the Pony of the Americas, Colorado Ranger, Tiger Horse, British Spotted Pony and the Knabstrupper breeds. The gene is also relatively common in the Miniature horse and Falabella breeds, the Spanish Mustang, the Noriker and the related South German Coldblood. The existence of leopard-spotted coats among Asian breeds such as the Karabair and Mongolian Altai has been recorded since ancient times, and suggests that the gene is very old. Leopard complex patterns exist in very low frequencies among American Quarter Horses, Connemaras and Welsh Ponies.

Gary Windass

Gary Windass is a fictional character in the UK television ITV soap opera, "Coronation Street". Portrayed by actor Mikey North, the character first appeared onscreen during the episode airing on 14 November 2008.
Character Creation.
Background.
The character of Gary was created as part of a new family unit that new producer Kim Crowther introduced to the soap opera, consisting of a mother, father, son and uncle. They were originally billed as a storyline device for established character David Platt. An ITV spokesperson said of the character and his onscreen family: "The Windass family are very rough and ready, always ducking and diving. Early on they get involved with David Platt when he helps to fit a new kitchen in the Windass family home. However, Anna thinks the work is shoddy and refuses to pay for it. David goes round, rips out the kitchen and sets fire to it outside the family’s house." fellow actress Debbie Rush said of their entrance and choice of surname for the family, that they would be prepared for the public taunts they would receive for their surname. The character was originally called "Carl Windass" but was changed last minute to "Gary Windass" after a series of name changes to all the members of the family since their inception, but before appearing onscreen. 
Upon their onscreen arrival it panned out almost as planned seeing him arrive as the son of Eddie and Anna Windass. He and his uncle Len went after David Platt and Joe McIntyre after David menaced his parents into handing over the money they owed for a new kitchen. Even though he has been brought up by his parents Gary looks up to his uncle who has had a heavy impact on his personality and his antics on the wrong side of the law.
Character development.
Personality and identity.
The character of Gary is quite one-sided at first with him being presented as a typical bad boy. Actor Mikey North who portrays the character told the Scarborough Evening News that he is a hard nut type of guy but has plenty more side to come out stating: "Gary has a lot of sides to him. He is a bit of a hard nut, but also a charmer with the ladies.". Also he calls his character a lovable rogue. His traits and personality are based on what his onscreen uncle tells him to act like and in an interview with media website Digital Spy he talks about this saying: "He gets it all from his uncle Len, who in a way is his idol. Gary copies his uncle and wants to be like him, even though he realises that it's not the best thing to do." In the same interview he also speaks about the fact that Gary is in love with himself and thinks he can get any girl he wants with his own one-liners and the fact he loves to know that he is succeeding in winding people up with his antics. Popular Corrie coverage website Corrieblog described the character as cunning in the 'thick way' as he knows he would have to face consequences for fighting after he continually wound fellow character David Platt up.
After six months of the character being onscreen North commented more about his character saying: "The first time you step onto the Street you have to stamp your mark as to what kind of character you are. At first Gary was shouty and happy to be aggressive, but the more you see it, his nicer side is coming out. In the run-up to the court case you see him showing affection towards his family. He fears the worst. He thinks he's going to go down. He's worried about his mum too."
Storylines.
Gary takes Joe McIntyre's (Reece Dinsdale) working tools as Len (Conor Ryan) threatens him. Gary and Len steal and burn out a sports car that David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) and his friend Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey) had been driving. Gary is later furious when David smugly informs him that the car was already stolen. Gary and the rest of his family later move right next door to the Platts' where their feud continues to heighten.
On Christmas Eve 2008, he flirts with Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan) in the Rovers, the pair then get drunk on Rosie's birthday champagne and end up in bed together that night much to the annoyance of Kevin (Michael Le Vell) and Sally (Sally Dynevor). The following day, Gary virtually ignores Rosie when he arrives at the Platts' Christmas dinner party. He then gets into a fist fight with David after telling him he has set his sights on David's girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). On New Year's Day 2009, Gary constantly pesters Tina, which results in Tina's father Joe warning him off. In spite of the tension, Gary shares a relatively friendly relationship with Tina, and enjoys winding David up by repeatedly bragging that Tina is soon going to be his girlfriend. 
After Gary nearly brawls with Joe, he talks Len into helping him steal expensive copper piping from Joe's workplace. Joe is initially the prime suspect, but David tells the police he'd seen saw Gary and Len laughing and driving away the night of the theft. Gary is thrilled to learn that Tina believes that he is innocent, as this drives a further wedge between her and David.
In January 2009, Gary continually follows and taunts David following him down the street. During their altercation Gary mentions several things from David's past including him driving into the lake, and pushing his mother down the stairs. Things escalate when David enters his house, having seen Tina approaching, Gary blocks him from shutting the door and tells him "Come out and fight me like a man, or are you scared?" David shoves Gary back and after a few more words the pair fight. Gary gets the better of it and David is left on the floor after the fight, later it emerges that he has a broken nose and concussion. After the fight Gary flees but he is arrested upon his return. Tina lies to the police after David tells her to, and the story also received media attention ahead of the air date.
Gary starts to become very worried that he is going to prison as Tina continues to persist with her claims. He becomes very angry when he discovers that Len has been intimidating Tina into changing her story and apologises to her for Len's behaviour. On 2 March 2009, Gary's court hearing takes place, during which Tina admits to the prosecution that she had been lying about who started the fight. Gary is cleared of the assault charge much to his and his family's delight.
A few months after the verdict David begins plotting against Gary. He steals tools from Bill Webster (Peter Armitage) and lets Gary take the wrap for it, only to defend him, this is a way for him to make Gary believe the air is cleared between the pair as they shake hands and make up. David tricks Gary into buying stolen goods from him - but they actually belong to Graeme. In June 2009, David takes full revenge on Gary when his mother Gail (Helen Worth) and grandmother Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) go abroad. He tricks Gary into robbing a house - which is Audrey's - David steals the keys and hides all photos of his family so Gary won't know whose house he is burgling. While David deliberately stays at home during the burglary, he asks Graeme to spy on Gary as he goes to the house, Gary is about to go home when he hears that David is not coming, but instead goes into the house. Graeme tells David about this via phone and David tells him to call the police. However, David's grandfather Ted Paige (Michael Byrne), who is housesitting, arrives at Audrey's. Gary sees him and pushes him as he tries to make a run for it, while Ted chases him. Ted recognises him and calls the police. Gary returns to the Street only to see a police car outside his house, he has no choice but to run away. David's plan to frame Gary and get rid of him has tragic consequences as Ted later has a heart attack, which he survives. Len offers Gary an alibi, but Gary is still arrested, only to be released later. Gary realises that David has set him up and attacks him, warning him not to cross him again. Gary had told his parents and the police that he wasn't robbing Audrey's house, however he later tells his parents the truth and decides to confess to the police. 
Gary apologises to Ted for what happened - although this is halted by David - Ted accepts the apology and even helps build bridges between Gail and the Windass family. However, the Windass family have since been shunned by the rest of the Street, when Gary goes to the corner shop, he is ignored by Tina and taunted by Minnie Chandra (Poppy Jhakra), although Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns) is less judgmental. Gary and Eddie (Steve Huison) are told to get out of the kebab shop by Tina and are later ridiculed by Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) and Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). On 26 June 2009, Gary is sentenced, much to the delight of David, however, Gary tells the police about David's involvement in the burglary and David is the one who is shunned as a result. While Gary is incarcerated, David is beaten up on the street by an unknown attacker. When Gary is released, he gleefully reveals to David that he organised it.
In November 2009, Gary makes an insulting remark about the armed forces when he sees Ted wearing a poppy for Remembrance Day. Ted and Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) vent their anger at Gary, who takes it to heart, apologising to Ted the next day and asks to hear about his days of service. Ted's stories soon lead Gary to go on a taster weekend for the army, after which he decides to sign up. On 15 January 2010, an emotional going away party is held for him in the Rovers, David shakes hands with him, whilst slyly putting an archery target on his back. Anna is furious when she discovers this, Gary tells her not to rise to it and calls David a 'loser' in front of everyone, it appears that the pub are more on Gary's side. After a tearful goodbye he says goodbye to his parents and leaves in the back of a cab.
Gary returns several weeks later with Quinny (Steven Bell), a friend who is also in the armed forces. During their visit, Quinny receives news that his brother, also serving in the Army, has lost his legs in a roadside bomb. The news makes Gary and Anna even more anxious about potentially going to war. Indeed, several weeks later, Gary goes AWOL through fear of what might happen in a warzone. He is discovered AWOL by David Platt who agrees to keep quiet. However, upon seeing the stress Anna is under, David informs the Windass parents of Gary's whereabouts. Eddie later convinces him to return to the Army.
In September 2010, Gary and Quinny return for another visit before they go to Afghanistan. Becky McDonald's (Katherine Kelly) half-sister Kylie Turner (Paula Lane) sets her sights on Gary and the two end up sleeping together in Mary Taylor's (Patti Clare) motor home. Gary soon tires of Kylie, however, and attempts to win the affection of wheelchair-user Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston). To prove himself, he stands up to a man who makes an insulting comment about Izzy's disability. Gary and Quinny later get into a fight outside the Rovers with the men in question, and Gary punches the thug. A passing Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment) tells Gary and Quinny to go before anybody sees them. Kirk later takes the blame for the attack, with a relieved Gary thankful to Kirk for saving his Army career. The night before he heads out to Afghanistan, Gary finally gets together with Izzy.
An army officer visits Anna and Eddie in November 2010, informing them that Gary was involved in a roadside bomb and is severely injured whereas the other troops, including Quinny, had died as a result. He also states that Gary will be sent to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham in Birmingham. Roy Cropper (David Neilson) informs the public at the Rovers about the tragic news and as a mark of respect he requests a 2 minute silence. Gary is psychologically and emotionally scarred as a result of the attack. He lashes out at those around him, including Anna. He plans on visited Quinny's bereaved parents but cannot face it and doesn't go. The chaotic aftermath of the street's tram crash on 6 December 2010 triggers Gary's post-traumatic stress disorder and he is forced to flee to his home where he breaks down in tears. He becomes increasingly more withdrawn and begins drinking alone much to the concern of Izzy, Eddie and Anna. Eventually, Gary manages to deal with this problem himself and eventually faces Quinny's parents which seemed to have helped him a lot.
Gary becomes obsessed with Izzy's welfare. He takes a job at Underworld so he can be around Izzy more. Izzy goes into town with Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) and Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) to get away from Gary for a while, only to get robbed by a cash point. Gary then takes Izzy's wheelchair away so she cannot leave the house and says he will later return it. He then keeps her imprisoned in the house until Izzy's father Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) rescues Izzy. He then breaks up with Izzy. 
When Owen takes an interest in Anna, Faye Butler (Ellie Leach) steals Owen's phone so that she and Anna can go to the cinema as planned instead of Anna meeting Owen at The Rovers Return. Faye later sends Anna a message that Owen does not want to meet her. After Anna finds out about the situation she tells Owen she is not interested. Later Owen and Anna sleep together. Anna does not know if she has made the right decision so she tells Gary. Gary then sets Owen and Anna up at The Bistro.
In July 2012, Izzy and Gary decide to have a baby. Izzy miscarries and they try to adopt, but can't due to Gary's criminal record. Izzy's sister Katy Armstrong (Georgia May Foote) offers to be a surrogate mother to their baby. At first, they all agree, but Katy's boyfriend initially Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) refuses to let them do it. Chesney agrees but Izzy sees it isn't fair so she calls it off - she also breaks up with Gary because of his desire to be a dad and her not being able to give him that. The reunite and eventually select Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) as their surrogate, after Owen offers to pay her. Tina is successfully impregnated with Gary and Izzy's child in November 2012, and her pregnancy goes smoothly for the first trimester, although Tina grows aggravated at Gary's interference. However, in April 2013 Gary's feelings for Tina become more romantic after Izzy leaves an antenatal class due to Gary's touching of Tina. Gary later cats on his feelings for Tina and makes a pass at her, but she rejects him. Izzy overhears Gary and Tina discussing what happened and as the pair argue Tina goes into labour. Tina gives birth to their son Jake prematurely, and Izzy bans Gary from seeing him as he tried to cheat on her. As Gary and Izzy continue to argue, Tina becomes convinced they won't make good parents and decided to keep Jake for herself. Izzy and Gary visit lawyers but find out it will take years to get Jake back. Gary is devastated when Izzy gives up fighting and tells Tina she can keep Jake. Realising she is not his real mother, Tina tearfully hands Jake over to his real parents. Afterwards Izzy begins to soften towards Gary and he moves back in with her and Jake.
Reception.
Tony Stewart of "The Mirror" said of Gary that David Platt has met his match in the character and the two of them have enough criminal convictions, Asbos and restraining orders to wallpaper over their living room and comparing Gary and his family's criminal record to that of the Battersbys', saying the latter compared to them it's like a day out with the Von Trapp family. Grace Dent of The Guardian stated her love for the Windass family and of the character Gary, and she went onto describe him stating: "Gary Windass loves thieving cars, stealing tools from vans, spitting globs of phlegm between his front teeth and, at the mere hint of sunshine, strutting about with his top off wearing trakkie-beeees that cry out for a good boil wash. But that's fine by me as he's TWOC'd all of David Platt's thunder.." MSN branded Gary and his family as chavs (Gary being the prime example) and being perfect guests for the Jeremy Kyle show, and going onto to calling the a million miles away from lower class yobbish families 'The Mortons' and 'The Battersbys'. Whereas Simon Swift of Soaplife magazine commented on the fact that on first looks he couldn't help feeling that Gary and the rest of the clan are a bit too much like original neighbours-from-hell the Battersbys. The character was also noted for the big impression he made within the soap in such a short space of time by Rick Fulton of The Daily Record So much so that he has been nominated for Villain Of The Year in The British Soap Awards 2009, which he did not go on to win. Kris Green of media website Digital Spy praised and commented on the fact that Gary and her family had 'settled in so well, in such a short space of time', with actor Mikey North stating that their success is down to the good writing and many plotlines the family received in the short time period. Mikey North also said that even though his character is a bad boy he has gained the public support after beating David Platt up, branding him as a legend for being the first one to do it. (The public loathe the character of David's antics) Ben Ashford of The Sun newspaper compared the real life fraud crimes of The Peters family, who came up with a range of illnesses including agoraphobia and alcoholism to swindle state handouts, as that mirroring Gary and the rest of his family, branding both units as 'scroungers'.

VP-46

Patrol Squadron 46 (VP-46), also known as the "Grey Knights", is a maritime patrol squadron of the United States Navy based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington. Part of Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing Ten, VP-46 is the oldest maritime patrol squadron and the second oldest aircraft squadron in the entire U.S. Navy, second only behind VFA-14.
Squadron history.
The VP-46 "Grey Knights" was officially established as VP-5S on July 1, 1931 at Naval Air Station Coco Solo in Panama flying the Martin PM-2. Within that year, the squadron redesignated as VP-5F and changed its homeport to Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California. In June 1933 the squadron transitioned to its second aircraft, the Consolidated P2Y-1. Then in 1938, the squadron transitioned to the Consolidated PBY Catalina and later redesignated as VP-32. During World War II, the squadron sank 3 German U-boats south of Haiti.
At the close of World War II, the squadron was redesignated as Medium Patrol Plane Squadron Six (VP-MS-6) and changed its home port to Naval Air Station Alameda, California. Upon changing its homeport to California, the squadron changed to its current designation, VP-46. In 1961, the "Grey Knights" changed its homeport to Naval Air Station Moffett Field and transitioned to the P2V Neptune, making it the squadron's first land-based aircraft in its history. In 1964, the squadron transitioned to the P-3A Orion and in the 1970s, the squadron transitioned again to the P-3C Orion.
In the 1990s, with the BRAC closure of NAS Moffett Field and its transition to Moffett Federal Airfield under NASA/Ames Research Center and the 129th Rescue Wing of the California Air National Guard, the squadron changed to its current homeport, NAS Whidbey Island, Washington. Since then, the "Grey Knights" have completed over 46 years and more than 300,046 hours of accident free flight operations, a Pacific Fleet record.

Erich Gutenberg

Erich Gutenberg (December 13, 1897 in Herford – May 22, 1984 in Cologne) was an influential German economist. 
He is considered the founder of modern German business studies after World War II. Gutenberg used microeconomy to explain the functioning of the enterprise. Therefore he also developed a new production function. With a system of inputs and outputs under management control he explained how a firm could be efficient.
He received his Ph.D. from the University of Halle in 1921 and subsequently taught as a professor at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main, and the University of Cologne.

2008 in men's road cycling

In 2008, for the first time in ten years, two Grand Tours were won by one rider, the Spaniard Alberto Contador. Alessandro Ballan succeeded fellow Italian Paolo Bettini as World Champion, winning the road race in his home country, where Varese hosted the World Championships for the second time in history. Bettini and German sprinter Erik Zabel were among the most prominent riders to quit after this season, while Mario Cipollini made a brief comeback in the early months of the year.
Despite even tighter controls and warnings concerning doping, and the introduction of the blood passport by the UCI, several major races, including the Giro and Tour were faced with positive tests. In addition, the ongoing feud between the UCI and the race organizations almost came to a definite break in March, when the UCI threatened to suspend riders participating in ASO's Paris–Nice. The cycling federation's ProTour seemed bankrupt halfway through the year when all remaining licensed teams announced their withdrawal. However, at the start of 2009, 16 teams saw their ProTour license renewed and two new teams joined the elite division of cycling. Crédit Agricole and Gerolsteiner stopped sponsorship of a team, and were not succeeded by new sponsors. Other than Gerolsteiner, many German companies who participated in cycling sponsorship in recent years withdrew their financial backing after this year's latest of doping cases related to German cycling. As a result, fewer professional teams and races, among them the Deutschland Tour, will be part of the 2009 season.
Amongst professional riders, Mark Cavendish was the most successful with 17 victories, including 4 in the Tour de France and two in the Giro d'Italia. His team, Team High Road (which got a new sponsor midway through the season, ever since going by the name Team Columbia), was by far the most successful with 77 victories. Alejandro Valverde was the most successful allround rider of the year based on the CQ ranking. 
After the end of the season, seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong announced his comeback to competitive road cycling for 2009, with the Astana Team.
