List of Kansas City Royals seasons

The Kansas City Royals are a professional baseball team from Kansas City, Missouri, currently playing in the American League Central.
The team was formed by pharmaceutical executive Ewing Kauffman as a result of the move of the Athletics to Oakland, and began play in 1969. They became competitive more quickly than most expansion teams in Major League Baseball, achieving a winning record in their third season. By 1976, the young team was becoming the dominant force in the AL West, winning ninety or more games in four consecutive seasons from 1975 to 1978 and twice being denied a World Series berth in the ninth inning by the Yankees.
Despite two lapses to below eighty wins, the Royals remained a force in baseball for a decade, reaching the 1980 World Series and winning in 1985 against cross-state rivals the St. Louis Cardinals, becoming the only team to ever rally from a three games to one deficit twice in the same postseason to win the World Series.
Since then, the Royals’ history has been one of consistent failure, with the team having not played in the postseason since, this being the longest postseason drought in any major North American league in modern times, and easily the longest currently stading. Their worst era was from 2002 to 2006, when they have four 100-loss seasons out of five.

Yakshagana raga

Yakshagana Rāga (Kannada:ಯಕ್ಷಗಾನ ರಾಗ, pronounced as "yaksha-gaana raaga")refers to melodic modes used in Yakshagana. It is based on pre-classical melodic forms that consist of a series of five or more musical notes upon which a melody is founded. Yakshagana Ragas have indigenous ragas and others derived from other forms of music. Ragas in Yakshagana are closely associated with a set of melodic forms called as Mattu. Yakshagana Ragas have their own Gamaka. Although Yakshagana Ragas shares names with other systems of music Ragas are different though names are same with a few exceptions. More than 80 ragas have been identified to have survived the onslought of popular and elite musical systems. In Yakshagana tradition, rāgas are associated with different times of the night throughout which Yakshagana is performed.
Nature of Yakshagana rāga.
Rāga describes a generalised form of melodic practice. It also prescribes a set of rules for building the melody. Yakshagana Raga is based not only on rules but also certain melodic structures called Mattu. It specifies the rules for movements up ("aaroha" [आरोह]) and down ("avroha" [अवरोह]) the scale, which "Swara" (notes) should figure more and which notes should be used more sparingly, which notes may be sung with "gamaka", phrases to be used, phrases to be avoided, and so on. The result is a framework that can be used to compose or improvise melodies, allowing for endless variation within the set of notes. What makes Yakshagana singing different are, among other things, 'Yaksha Gamaka'. Yaksha Gamaka are distinct sets of notes and also way of approaching a note or rendering a note to form a particular "Mattu".
More than adhering to stricter scale Yakshagana Raga follows the metre of Yakshagana Poetry called the Yakshagana Chandhas. The melody is formed from a deep voice formed by controlling muscles as low as pelvic and abdominal muscles. This high pitched singing might have come out of need to reach all audience in a Yakshagana bayalata which is an outdoor activity. Recently singers have adopted softer singing because of the mike. Some Hindustani Ragas modified to suite Yakshagana performance can also be seen (e.g. Bhimpalas).
Yakshagana Rāga and time.
Unlike in other classical forms Yakshagana performance starts with Raga Naati or Chala Naati in late evening( But the actual story or prasanga starts with raga bhiravi) and ends with Mohana Raga in early morning.
Yakshagana Gamaka.
Yakshagana music has its own Gamakas. Yakshagana Gamakas are name given to the set of sequence of notes often used in only in Yakshagana ragas. It can also refer to, in popular parlance, inflections applied on notes. These Gamakas give a distinct flavor to Yakshagana ragas. These Gamakas are learned by training and are among features which make Yakshagana sound different from other forms of music.
Some well-known ragas.
These ragas share names of the ragas of Karnataka Sangeetha but structurally different from them with very few exceptions.

The Beaverdell Range is a subrange of the Okanagan Highland in the Southern Interior of British Columbia, located between the West Kettle and Kettle Rivers, and running nearly due south from Big White Mountain, which is its highest summit, and the highest in the Okanagan Highland, and lies near the head of the Kettle.
The Beaverdell Range gets its name from the community of Beaverdell, which lies on its southwest flank midway along the West Kettle River, which was also the route of the Kettle Valley Railway, now a biking and hiking trail that is part of the Trans-Canada Trail.
The range is of considerable mineralogical interest as it is known to contain large deposits of uranium, for which British Columbia has had for many years a mining moratorium. Residents of the area oppose uranium mining, although the history of the region is connected with various small gold rushes.

Smart card security

The security of a smart card system consists of the front-end enforcement, front-end and back-end verification, back-end audit and system fraud damage control. Security is addressed at the system level. 
Technically Mifare cards can be emulated. However if the system security design is correct, fraud is only possible with a collaborating cardholder or merchant. It is improbable that a merchant would accept a payment with the cardholder carrying a big emulator to pay for the transaction.
Differential power analysis.
Differential power analysis
involves measuring the precise time and electrical current required for certain encryption or decryption operations. From these measurements, an attacker can deduce the on-chip private key used by public key algorithms such as RSA. Some implementations of symmetric ciphers can be vulnerable to timing or power attacks as well.
Physical disassembly.
Smart cards can be physically disassembled by using acid, abrasives, or some other technique to obtain unrestricted access to the on-board microprocessor. Although such techniques involve a fairly high risk of permanent damage to the chip, and irrecoverable loss of the secret keys therein, they permit much more detailed information (e.g. photomicrographs of encryption hardware) to be extracted.

It is located midway along the West Kettle River between Kelowna and Rock Creek along British Columbia Highway 33.
Beaverdell was originally named Beaverton, but when its post office was amalgamated with that of nearby Rendell, the names of the two locations were combined into Beaverdell. It is the namesake of the Beaverdell Range, which is on the settlement's east side and is the mountain spine lying between the West Kettle River and the Kettle River.
Climate.
Beaverdell has one of the highest diurnal temperature variations in Canada. In addition, this community has the highest diurnal temperature variation in Canada from June through September by means of the dry and sunny climate, a relatively high elevation, and the surrounding geography. The daily temperature swings during the winter are less varied thanks to the presence of valley cloud.

Simple sequence length polymorphism

Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLPs) are used as genetic markers with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). An SSLP is a type of polymorphism: a difference in DNA sequence amongst individuals. SSLPs are repeated sequences over varying base lengths in intergenic regions of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Variance in the length of SSLPs can be used to understand genetic variance between two individuals in a certain species.
Applications.
An example of the usage of SSLPs (microsatellites) is seen in a study by Rosenberg et al., in which Rosenberg and his team used SSLPs to cluster different continental races. The study was critical to Nicholas Wade's New York Times Bestseller, "".
Rosenberg Study.
Rosenberg studied 377 SSLPs in 1000 people in 52 different regions of the world. By using PCR and Cluster analysis, Rosenberg was able to group individuals that had the same SSLPs . These SSLPs were extremely useful to the experiment because they do not affect the phenotypes of the individuals, thus being unaffected by natural selection.

Zebrasoma scopas

The brown tang, twotone or brush-tail tang ("Zebrasoma scopas") is a marine reef tang in the fish family Acanthuridae. The brown tang is found throughout Oceania and is a herbivorous fish, feeding predominantly on filamentous algae. It is a highly popular fish in the aquarium trade.
Description.
The brown tang is a laterally compressed, deep bodied fish with a protruding snout which grows to about . The head is whitish and the body pale brown shading to a dark brownish-black near the black tail. There are faint pale green longitudinal lines starting as dots at the head end and becoming continuous and then dotted again posteriorly. The juveniles are rather paler and have yellowish bars near the anterior end. They also have relatively larger dorsal fins. The adults have a white spine on the caudal peduncle. The large, sail-like dorsal fin has 4 or 5 spines and 23 to 25 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 19 to 21 soft rays.
Brown Tang is also featured for the first time in the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's.
Distribution.
The brown tang is found in the Indo-Pacific region, living at water depths of up to . Its range extends from the coasts of East Africa to Japan, the Pitcairn Islands, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Australia, Lord Howe Island and Rapa Iti. In 2008, a brown tang was observed near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, far outside its native range.
Biology.
The brown tang feeds mainly on filamentous algae. For this purpose it has specialised pharyngeal teeth. It is usually found on the exposed side of reefs and in coral-rich lagoons. The adults are gregarious and sometimes form schools but the juveniles are solitary and are often to be found swimming among corals.
The brown tang is monogamous, though spawning has been observed both between pairs and among small groups. The male tends to be larger than the female. The fish rush up to the surface to spawn, fertilisation is external and the eggs are scattered in the water column. The larvae are planktonic for several weeks before settling and undergoing metamorphosis into juveniles.
Use in aquaria.
Brown tangs are popular fish to keep in a reef aquarium. They are smaller and less aggressive than other members of the Acanthuridae family and are more tolerant of a wide range of living conditions. They will accept various feedstuffs including meaty materials but the main part of the diet should be vegetable. They will eat the algae that tend to grow inadvertently in the tank. They are territorial so that if more than one is to be kept, they should all be introduced at the same time.

Yakshagana Tala

Yakshagana Tala (Kannada:ಯಕ್ಷಗಾನ ತಾಳ, pronounced as "yaksha-gaana taala"), is a rhythmical pattern in Yakshagana that is determined by a composition called Yakshagana Padya. Tala also decides how a composition is enacted by dancers. It is similar to Tala in other forms of Indian music, but is structurally different from them. Each composition is set to one or more talas, and as a composition is rendered by Himmela, the percussion artist(s) play supporting the dance performance. Tala is maintained by the singer using a pair of finger bells. 
The instrument for rhythm in Yakshagana are the Chande, Maddale and a Yakshagana Tala (bell) is also used along with chande.
Yakshagana has a complete and complex system for rhythms. The most common Talas in Yakshagana are Matte, Eaka,Udaape, Jampe, Rupaka, Trivde, Atta, KorE and Aadi. Each tala has a cycle of N beats divided in M bars. Some talas are more than 5 minutes long (e.g. Abbara Tala). Note that although, the names of Talas are similar to Karnataka Sangeetha only a few talas are similar and other rhythms are completely different. Each taal is identified by a typical set of syllables similar to bols in Tabla. A set of syllables representing the basic rhythm of taala is called 'Badtige' or 'Tatkaara'. The variations of a particular taala are called 'Nade' (movement) which is similar to Kaida in Tabla.
Yakshagana music vocalists (Bhagavathas) mark the "tala" by tapping a pair of bells. Talas are identified by Ghaatha and are largely decided by the metre of the Yakshagana poetry Some Taalas have been demonstrated on chande in the following external links.[http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=sAllmsgkKFg],[http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=rjnayCTXsP0&feature=channel],[http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzGjiepnB0&feature=channel]
Some Yakshagana Talas.
Scholars have disagreement on the names and beat structure of the above Talas. But the details provided here are generally acceptable.
History.
The talas predate Karnataka Sangeetha talas. It is generally agreed that the rhythm patterns that form a basis for Karnataka Sangeetha also forms a basis for yakshagana Talas. In fact it is believed that Yakshagana uses pre classical patterns guided by the metres of the Yakshagana Poetry. A folk flavour added to these talas make them very popular among the followers.

Helium atom

A helium atom is an atom of the chemical element helium. Helium is composed of two electrons bound by the electromagnetic force to a nucleus containing two protons along with either one or two neutrons, depending on the isotope, held together by the strong force. Unlike for hydrogen, a closed-form solution to the Schrödinger equation for the helium atom has not been found. However, various approximations, such as the Hartree-Fock method, can be used to estimate the ground state energy and wavefunction of the atom.
Introduction.
The Hamiltonian of helium, considered as a three-body system of two electrons and a nucleus and after separating out the centre-of-mass motion, can be written as
where formula_2 is the reduced mass of an electron with respect to the nucleus, formula_3 and formula_4 are the electron-nucleus distance vectors and formula_5. The nuclear charge, formula_6 is 2 for helium. In the approximation of an infinitely heavy nucleus, formula_7 we have formula_8 and the mass polarization term formula_9 disappears. In atomic units the Hamiltonian simplifies to
The presence of the electron-electron interaction term 1/r12 makes this equation non separable. This means that formula_11 cannot be written as a product of one-electron wave functions and the wave function is entangled. Therefore, measurements cannot be made on one particle without affecting the other. Nevertheless, quite good theoretical descriptions of helium can be obtained within the Hartree-Fock and Thomas-Fermi approximations.
Hartree-Fock Method.
The Hartree-Fock method is used for a variety of atomic systems. However it is just an approximation, and there are more accurate and efficient methods used today to solve atomic systems. The "many-body problem" for helium and other few electron systems can be solved quite accurately. For example the ground state of helium is known to fifteen digits. In Hartree-Fock theory, the electrons are assumed to move in a potential created by the nucleus and the other electrons. The Hamiltonian for helium with 2 electrons can be written as a sum of the Hamiltonians for each electron:
formula_12
where the zero-order unperturbed Hamiltonian is
formula_13
while the perturbation term:
formula_14
is the electron-electron interaction. H0 is just the sum of the two hydrogenic Hamiltonians:
formula_15
where
formula_16
En1, the energy eigenvalues and formula_17, the corresponding eigenfunctions of the hydrogenic Hamiltonian will denote the normalized energy eigenvalues and the normalized eigenfunctions. So:
formula_18
where
formula_19
Neglecting the electron-electron repulsion term, the Schrödinger equation for the spatial part of the two-electron wave function will reduce to the 'zero-order' equation
formula_20
This equation is separable and the eigenfunctions can be written in the form of single products of hydrogenic wave functions:
formula_21
The corresponding energies are (in a.u.):
formula_22
Note that the wave function
formula_23
An exchange of electron labels corresponds to the same energy formula_24. This particular case of degeneracy with respect to exchange of electron labels is called exchange degeneracy. The exact spatial wave functions of two-electron atoms must either be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of the coordinates formula_3 and formula_4 of the two electrons. The proper wave function then must be composed of the symmetric (+) and antisymmetric(-) linear combinations:
formula_27
This comes from Slater determinants.
The factor formula_28 normalizes formula_29. In order to get this wave function into a single product of one-particle wave functions, we use the fact that this is in the ground state. So formula_30. So the formula_31 will vanish, in agreement with the original formulation of the Pauli exclusion principle, in which two electrons cannot be in the same state. Therefore the wave function for helium can be written as
formula_32
Where formula_33 and formula_34 use the wave functions for the hydrogen Hamiltonian. \left(\frac{Z}{a_0}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\ e^{-{\textstyle \frac{Zr}{a_0}}}\; </math>. In atomic units, the Bohr radius formula_35 equals 1, and the wavefunction becomes formula_36.}} For helium, Z = 2 from
formula_37
where Eformula_38 a.u. which is approximately -108.8 eV, which corresponds to an ionization potential Vformula_39 a.u. (formula_40 eV). The experimental values are Eformula_41 a.u. (formula_42 eV) and Vformula_43 a.u. (formula_44 eV).
The energy that we obtained is too low because the repulsion term between the electrons was ignored, whose effect is to raise the energy levels. As Z gets bigger, our approach should yield better results, since the electron-electron repulsion term will get smaller.
So far a very crude independent-particle approximation has been used, in which the electron-electron repulsion term is completely omitted. Splitting the Hamiltonian showed below will improve the results:
formula_45
where
formula_46
and
formula_47
V(r) is a central potential which is chosen so that the effect of the perturbation formula_48 is small. The net effect of each electron on the motion of the other one is to screen somewhat the charge of the nucleus, so a simple guess for V(r) is
formula_49
where S is a screening constant and the quantity Ze is the effective charge. The potential is a Coulomb interaction, so the corresponding individual electron energies are given (in a.u.) by
formula_50
and the corresponding wave function is given by
formula_51
If Ze was 1.70, that would make the expression above for the ground state energy agree with the experimental value E0 = -2.903 a.u. of the ground state energy of helium. Since Z = 2 in this case, the screening constant is S = .30. For the ground state of helium, for the average shielding approximation, the screening effect of each electron on the other one is equivalent to about formula_52 of the electronic charge.
Thomas–Fermi method.
Not long after Schrödinger developed the wave equation, the Thomas–Fermi model was developed. Density functional theory is used to describe the particle density formula_53, and the ground state energy E(N), where N is the number of electrons in the atom. If there are a large number of electrons, the Schrödinger equation runs into problems, because it gets very difficult to solve, even in the atoms ground states. This is where density functional theory comes in. Thomas-Fermi theory gives very good intuition of what is happening in the ground states of atoms and molecules with N electrons.
The energy functional for an atom with N electrons is given by:
formula_54
Where
formula_55
The electron density needs to be greater than or equal to 0, formula_56, and formula_57 is convex.
In the energy functional, each term holds a certain meaning. The first term describes the minimum quantum-mechanical kinetic energy required to create the electron density formula_58 for an N number of electrons. The next term is the attractive interaction of the electrons with the nuclei through the Coulomb potential formula_59. The final term is the electron-electron repulsion potential energy.
So the Hamiltonian for a system of many electrons can be written:
formula_60
For helium, N = 2, so the Hamiltonian is given by:
formula_61
Where
formula_62
yielding
formula_63
From the Hartree-Fock method, it is known that ignoring the electron-electron repulsion term, the energy is 8E1 = -109 eV.
The variational method.
To obtain a more accurate energy the variational principle can be applied to the electron-electron potential Vee using the wave function
formula_64:
formula_65
After integrating this, the result is:
formula_66
This is closer to the theoretical value, but if a better trial wave function is used, an even more accurate answer could be obtained. An ideal wave function would be one that doesn't ignore the influence of the other electron. In other words, each electron represents a cloud of negative charge which somewhat shields the nucleus so that the other electron actually sees an effective nuclear charge Z that is less than 2. A wave function of this type is given by:
formula_67
Treating Z as a variational parameter to minimize H. The Hamiltonian using the wave function above is given by:
formula_68
After calculating the expectation value of formula_69 and Vee the expectation value of the Hamiltonian becomes:
formula_70
The minimum value of Z needs to be calculated, so taking a derivative with respect to Z and setting the equation to 0 will give the minimum value of Z:
formula_71
formula_72
This shows that the other electron somewhat shields the nucleus reducing the effective charge from 2 to 1.69. So we obtain the most accurate result yet:
formula_73
Where again, E1 represents the ionization energy of hydrogen.
By using more complicated/accurate wave functions, the ground state energy of helium has been calculated closer and closer to the experimental value -78.95 eV. The variational approach has been refined to very high accuracy for a comprehensive regime of quantum states by G.W.F. Drake and co-workers using Hylleraas or Frankowski-Pekeris basis functions. It should be noted that one needs to include relativistic and quantum electrodynamic corrections to get full agreement with experiment to spectroscopic accuracy.

Sailfin tang

The sailfin tang ("Zebrasoma veliferum") is a marine reef tang in the fish family Acanthuridae. They may live at water depths of 1 - 60 m (3 - 200 ft) or more. The fish grow to a maximum length of 40 cm (15.8 in). It has an extensive range throughout Oceania, the Indian Ocean, and the South Pacific. "Zebrasoma veliferum" is a popular fish in the aquarium trade. They are herbivorous fish specializing in filamentous algae. Though their skin is light beige with stripes, it can turn dark brown under stress.
Description.
This species is one of the largest members of its genus. The largest scientifically measured sailfin tang was 40.0 cm (15.7 in). 
The body of the sailfin tang is disc-shaped with a much elevated dorsal fin and a big anal fin. It has an extended snout. Compared to the other members of the genus "Zebrasoma", the sailfin tang has larger but fewer pharyngeal teeth. On each side of the caudal peduncle is a single sharp spine (the so-called scalpel) which is used for defence and to establish dominance. When the fish is not using its scalpel, it is folded down inside a groove.
The sailfin tang is decorated with broad, pale yellow bands that alternate with darker bands over its body. The bending extends into both dorsal and anal fins. On the darker bands are yellow dots and stripes. The caudal fin is yellow. The head of the fish is white adorned with yellow dots. A dark band with yellow dots runs across the eye and another dark band with dots is located right behind the eye. 
Juvenile specimens look similar to the adult fish, but with more yellow colouring. They are also nearly identical to the unrelated adult Moorish idol.

Louis-Henri Foreau (1866-1938) was a French artist.
Foreau was a student of Jules Lefebvre, Henry Lévy, Luc-Olivier Merson and mainly of Henri Harpignies, with whom he became good friends.
From 1888 onwards he often participated in the different Salon exhibitions in France and abroad. He became a jury member of the Société des Artistes Français, and chairman of the Association des Paysagistes Français.
In his work influences from the Impressionists, the Symbolists and Barbizon movement are visible. Nevertheless Foreau created his own style, which is characterized by a strict technique, an intense form of observation and a refined, somewhat melancholic atmosphere, which is also apparent in the work of Corot.
In his oeuvre he drew on three themes: rural life, gardens and parks and Paris and its surroundings.

"Papermoon" (stylized as "PAPERMOON") is Tommy heavenly6's 9th single and Tomoko Kawase's 16th single overall, which was released on December 10, 2008. Since The Brilliant Green made their comeback, Kawase had been very inactive as a solo singer. Since "Papermoon" has been released, it marks her first solo single in over a year. "Papermoon" was featured as the second opening song to the anime "Soul Eater". "Papermoon"'s B-side is a song called "Ruby Shoes", which is possibly in reference to the overall theme of the "Papermoon" music video. "Papermoon" peaked at #10 on the Oricon singles chart.
Music video.
The music video features Tommy heavenly6 and her band in a setting which resembles The Wizard of Oz. Her band is dressed in matching attire featuring a tin man, scarecrow, and a lion. Kawase herself is dressed up to resemble Dorothy. Kawase is also shown singing in a room that very much resembles a scene in The Wizard of Oz in which Dorothy's house is taken up into the tornado. Dorothy then looks out the window of her room to see many things and people familiar to her. In the video, things and people from Tommy heavenly6's past videos can be seen. Such as, Tommy February6 and Santa Claus riding a Panda Bear from Tommy heavenly6's I Love Xmas PV, to the cart pulled by a bull she rides in in her Pray PV, and other miscellaneous objects.

Medium Large

Medium Large is a Web comic written and drawn by Francesco Marciuliano, who is also the current writer of "Sally Forth." Unlike Sally Forth, "Medium Large" does not focus on a single cast of characters, though there are some recurring features, most notably the fictitious "Teenage Girl President" series. The strip also focuses on pop culture arcana, spoofing a number of entertainment properties, including "Sally Forth" itself.
The humor is often filtered through the perspective of an otherwise mute observer known only as Medium Large Guy. MLG frequently watches the fictional Medium Large Network or sits at a bar with other famous cartoon or pop cultural figures.
The most famous Medium Large strip is a parody of the comic strip B.C. where the main characters discuss whether they are even pretending to be cavemen any more.

Annette Lareau

Annette Lareau is a sociologist working at the University of Pennsylvania. She is a graduate of U.C. Santa Cruz and earned her PhD in Sociology from U.C. Berkeley. She started her career at South Illinois University at Carbondale and also previously worked as a Professor of Sociology at Temple University, Pennsylvania from 1990 to 2005. She has served as a professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, College Park, and in 2008 joined as professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania where she is the Stanley I. Sheerr Professor. During the 2005-2006 school year she moved to Palo Alto, California to complete a residence at the Center for Advanced Study of Behavioral Sciences. Lareau has been very active with organizations such as the Eastern Sociological Society, Sociology of Education journal, and the American Sociological Association.
Lareau has completed extensive field work studying the daily lives of both African-Americans and European-Americans. She is also credited with the creation of the term concerted cultivation. This concept refers to middle class child rearing practices. She says that this differs from the parents of children in working-class families, who attribute much of their child raising tactics to the accomplishment of natural growth.
Writings.
She is the author of "Home Advantage: Social Class and Parental Intervention in Elementary Education (1989)", coeditor of "Journeys through Ethnography: Realistic Accounts of Fieldwork (1996)", and author of "Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life (2003)". She conducted field work between 1993 and 1995 with 10- and 11-year-old children, and then followed up with them 10 years later when the children were 20 and 21 years old.
"Unequal Childhoods".
Her field research was the basis for her book "Unequal Childhoods", which explained in detail her research and interviews with 88 children and their parents. The subjects included white and black children from middle class, working class, and poor families. Through her observations she discovered differences in parenting styles that related to class distinctions. Specifically, she observed how different family circumstances influenced the children's performance and interactions in and out of school. Her findings allowed her to draw a major distinction between the parenting styles of working class / poor parents and middle class parents. In this book, she highlights the benefits and shortcomings of raising children through either concerted cultivation or natural growth. 
"Concerted Cultivation" is the type of childrearing that middle class parents practice. This childrearing practice consists of parents participating in the organization of their child's afterschool activities and providing a structured life for their child. The parents generally have a better education and try to impress this upon their child on a daily basis. Parents teach their children things that are not taught in school that will help them to perform better and get better grades on tests and ultimately do better in school. The main advantage to this type of childrearing is that children are taught lessons through organized activities that help prepare them for a white collar job and the types of interactions that a white collar worker encounters. Some examples of this type of parental teaching is engagement in critical thinking such as asking challenging questions, the use of advanced grammar, and help a stronger family support structure. The main disadvantage of concerted cultivation is that often the child becomes bored easily and cannot entertain themselves.
"The Accomplishment of Natural Growth" is the type of childrearing that working class and poor parents practice, and not necessarily by choice. They are less involved with the structure of their child’s after school activities and generally have less education and time to impress values upon their children that will give them an advantage in school. This type of childrearing involves less organized activities and more free time for their children to play with other children in the neighborhood.
The book "Unequal Childhoods" includes detailed descriptions of her encounters and organized data from her analysis. She compiled a list of formal and informal activities that specific children were involved in, whether they were middle class, working class, or poor, and whether they have requested a teacher for their children. There is also information about whether or not the parents knew people who are psychologists, doctors, lawyers, or teachers. The book contains a great deal of quotes, stories of her experiences while observing, and connections that explain why particular children might act a certain way. Each chapter is an in-depth analysis of a different family, concerning the specific situation surrounding the child and how it has affected their life. From all her observations and analysis, Lareau concludes that the different types of childrearing have more to do with class than race. Through her research she has found that the childrearing ways of the middle class perpetuate inequality because of the advantages that the children have through participation in extracurricular activities, engagement in critical thinking and problem solving. These practices of more parental involvement are what perpetuate inequalities from one generation to the next. Lareau stresses the importance of parents being involved in their children's lives and talks about how middle class children benefit from having a sense of entitlement and the practice of gaining access to scarce resources. She also stresses the importance of literacy as a huge factor in a child's success. A new version of the book was released in September 2011, adding over 100 new pages of text to the original version.
Data collection process.
In 1989-1990 she observed white and black children from two third grade classrooms in a small Midwestern town, Lawrenceville, and interviewed the mothers, fathers, and guardians of the children as well as the school professionals working with the children. Then in 1992-1993 she received a grant from the Spencer Foundation to study a third grade classroom in Lower Richmond, an urban school district. In order to do this, she hired and trained 5 research assistants in 1993, who would carry out in-depth interviews with the families. Lareau and her research team started out with 40 families and later chose 12 of the 40 families for more intensive visits. In early 1994, they visited the families 20 times each, roughly two to three hours at a time, and accompanied them on various outings and appointments. The research assistants analyzed the data, transcribed the interviews, and wrote a few co-authored papers on the findings in 1996. Lareau wrote the first draft of her book Unequal Childhoods in 1999 and completed the book by 2002. Unequal Childhoods was discussed by Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers. 
Awards.
Lareau has won several awards over her career. Her first book, Home Advantage, won the Sociology of Education Award for Scholarship of the American Sociological Association. This book also won the AESA Critics Choice award from the American Educational Studies Association. For her book Unequal Childhoods, she won the Sociology of Culture Section Best Book Award as well as the William J. Goode Best Book Length Contribution to Family Sociology Award, both from the American Sociological Association. In 2004, she won the American Sociological Association Section on Children and Youth Distinguished Contribution to Scholarship Award. American Sociological Association. In 2012, Lareau was nominated to be the President of the American Sociological Association. In June 2012, Annette Lareau was elected President of the American Sociological Association from approximately August 2013 to August 2014. She will preside over the 105th gathering of sociologists in San Francisco, California from August 16th to August 19th, 2014.

After having toured for "A.O. Mod. TV. Vers.", WEA demanded another album immediately, so "Xenophobia (Why?)" was written and recorded in just six weeks, the title was inspired by race issues surfacing in the lead-up to Australia's Bicentennial year. The album peaked at #15 on the Kent Music Report for the Australian albums chart, and released in 14 countries. It provided three singles, "(Forget about the) Working Week", "Clarity of Mind" and "Waiting". None of the singles peaked in the Top 40 of the Kent Music Report for the Australian singles charts.
Background.
Spy vs Spy had formed in 1981 in Sydney as a ska/pub rock band. Their line-up was the trio Craig Bloxom on bass guitar/lead vocals, Cliff Grigg on drums/percussion and Mike Weiley on lead guitar/vocals. They became known for tackling political issues including racism, homelessness and contemporary drug culture. By 1984 they were using the name v. Spy v. Spy to avoid legal problems with "Mad" magazine. They were signed to Midnight Oil's label Powderworks and managed by Oils manager, Gary Morris. Their first two full-length albums "Harry's Reasons" and "A.O. Mod. TV. Vers." were produced by Leszek Karski.

A whoopie sling is an easily adjustable rope sling designed for tree pruning or tree removal. The whoopie sling works by wrapping the sling around the trunk of a tree or a heavy load bearing limb and pulling the end of the rope within the sling through a spliced choker. By adjusting the size of the eye in the rope through the choker the user is able to adjust the length of the sling constricting around the tree without needing knots. It is also becoming more common (usually in smaller diameter) for suspending hammocks during hiking or camping.

Tvilum Priory

Tvilum Priory was a monastery of Augustinian Canons at Tvilum near Gjern, to the north of Silkeborg, Denmark.
History.
Tvilum Priory, the latest of the Augustinian monasteries in Denmark, was founded between 1246 and 1249 by Bishop Gunner of Ribe, who had hoped to establish the Augustinians in the cathedral chapter at Ribe, but in vain. After he resigned his bishopric in 1246, he donated all his worldly goods to the monastery at Tvilum, while he himself became a Franciscan friar. The Bishop of Aarhus at about the same time gifted the income of the churches of Gjern and the Ladegård to provide for them. The priory was built on the east bank of the Guden River, at that time an important transportation corridor in central Jutland. The first canons came from Dalby Abbey (or Priory), an Augustinian house in Scania (then in Denmark, now in Sweden).
The monastery was constructed as a two-storey rectangular building consisting of four ranges, of which the church formed the north range. The others included the dormitory, hospital, chapter house, storage, and space for the lay brothers who assisted with the day to day work of the monastery. The church was planned as a flat-roofed Romanesque structure but during construction more modern Gothic vaulting was added. It was built out of hand made bricks. In 1470 the church at Ladegård was demolished, after which the priory church has served also as a parish church up to the present day.
An interesting obligation of the monastery, perhaps in return for royal beneficence, was to provide fresh horses and hounds for royal hunts. The burden became so great that the prior wrote to Christoffer I to complain about the cost of providing the services. The arms of King Valdemar Atterdag were painted on the walls of the church in about 1350 and can still be seen there.
Over time the monastery came into possession of many farms and properties in the area as families donated land in memory of deceased family members, or from the desire to help the church, or as bequests in wills.
Dissolution.
The Reformation in Denmark swept Catholic teaching and practice aside as early as 1527, but these far-reaching changes did not reach the isolated hinterlands where Tvilum lay until sometime in 1536, when the crown seized all monastic houses and property in Denmark. Tradition says that the Augustinian canons, who were ordained priests, then became Lutheran pastors. All of the monastery holdings were eventually transferred to Skanderborg Castle, which used the farm income to support the expansion and operations of the castle. The monastic buildings were demolished relatively quickly, but the priory church survived because it was the parish church in a very small town. The pre-Reformation crucifix from the monastery was preserved, as was the fine altarpiece carved in the late 15th century.

New Jersey Ballet

The New Jersey Ballet is a ballet company based in Livingston, New Jersey in the United States, founded in 1958 by native New Jerseyan Carolyn Clark and her fellow dancer, George Tomal.
History.
Carolyn Clark's mother established New Jersey School of Ballet in Orange, New Jersey in 1953 with her mother's friends who were dancers. Clark has involved in her mother's dance school operation since its beginning. She has later become a professional dancer herself. After touring around the world with American Ballet Theatre and the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, she had conceived an idea to create a ballet company in New Jersey with national significance. The company was finally founded in 1958 with the first performance on December 27, 1958 at the Arts High School in Newark, New Jersey.
After thirteen years from the first season that consisted of two performances for a few hundred people, New Jersey Ballet started a production of "The Nutcracker" in 1971 at Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey with world renowned dancer, Edward Villella, in the role of the Cavalier. The company has run "Nutcracker" production at Paper Mill Playhouse with Paper Mill Orchestra for many consecutive years since its debut. It also travels to bergenPAC in Englewood, New Jersey, Stafford Township Arts Center in Manahawkin, New Jersey and Middle Township PAC in Cape May Court House. 
The company started gaining wider recognition when it started the tours to Taiwan, the Soviet Union, Bermuda and Italy during the 1990s. In 2004, the company staged full-length production of "Esmeralda" at New Jersey Performing Arts Center. It was the first company in the United State to perform full-length version of "Esmeralda" and it had gained national recognition. The company also visited India's newly opened National Centre for the Performing Arts in Mumbai in 2006 with its "Nutcracker" production. It was the first full-length classical ballet in India. In 2008, it traveled to Russia on a seven-city tour of mixed repertory that included "Saturday Night", "For Ella", "Let's Go South" and "Belong".
Today, the annual season consists of many performances in many venues throughout New Jersey. It also includes New Jersey Ballet Matinee for Kids and Families, which is a collections of children's ballets of classic tales such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Tom Sawyer, Hansel & Gretel and more.
New Jersey School of Ballet.
At the present time, the school offers many courses and instructions ranging from age 4 to professional. The classes include Ballet, Academic Ballet, Pointe, Jazz and Tap. The school offers intensive program for Ballet, Variations, Partnering, Character, Jazz, and Special Workshops by audition only. The classes are held in three locations; Livingston, New Jersey; Somerville, New Jersey; and Morristown, New Jersey. Each year, more than one hundred students who pass auditions have a chance to perform in New Jersey Ballet's Nutcracker professional production. Advanced students are included in New Jersey Ballet Matinee for Kids and Families productions. 
New Jersey Ballet's Junior Company is the school's pre-professional program for students with carrier track in dance. Students have opportunities to work with professional dancers, for example, being cast members when the Bolshoi performed at the Metropolitan Opera. Many alumni have performed with or are current dancers of American Ballet Theatre, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, The Joffrey, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and other major companies.

Barbelin Hall

Barbelin Hall is the most enduring and memorable building on the campus of Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The structure was completed in 1927 and was the first building on the current City Avenue campus known as Hawk Hill. The building is known for its 165 foot tower which has become a symbol of the University. It is often used as a secondary logo for SJU. For some time, the tower was the highest point from sea level in Philadelphia.
The building is named for Felix-Joseph Barbelin who served two separate terms as president of what was then known as Saint Joseph's College. Constructed of Wissahickon schist (a local stone) and limestone, the facade features gargoyles, heads of early presidents of the college, and an array of other limestone carvings. The building was first used for all types of classes and as a residence hall. It is now exclusively used for the College of Arts & Sciences at Saint Joseph's. What is known as Barbelin Quad is located in the middle of the building. The tower overlooks the entire campus including Finnesey Field and the Haub School of Business in Mandeville Hall.
A number of gargoyles can be seen on the building while on Barbelin Quad. Statues and grotesques of heads of former presidents of Saint Joseph's are also located on the edges of the building. In front of Barbelin, overlooking City Avenue, is a statue of Saint Joseph.

Wang Jungzhi

Wang Jungzhi (Wang Ch'un Ch'ih) was one the last people to be executed by the British Army in World War I. He was killed by firing squad on 8 May 1919, six months after the Armistice after being convicted of murder.
Chinese labourers.
Wang Jungzhi was a member of the 107th Chinese Labour Corps, which maintained trenches and cleared battlefields and their surrounding areas of debris and destruction. It was harrowing work because of the thousands of dead, dismembered and rotting bodies. They worked close to danger areas, their stress increased by racial hostility within the army and from local residents.
The Chinese were engaged when the Beiyang government agreed on 30 December 1916 to send 140,000 Chinese to work with the British. They were to be labourers rather than soldiers because China, not then part of the war, would not send men to fight. It saw sending men to work in docks and elsewhere as a commercial proposition without political intent.
Working conditions.
The Belgian historian Dr Patrick Loodts said: "They found themselves behind the English lines in living conditions they certainly hadn't imagined! They were lodged in camps which they weren't allowed to leave, subjected to military discipline, carrying out the hard work needed to maintain the immense network of trenches." They were contracted to work seven days a week, ten hours a day, for three years. Their only days off were for Chinese national holidays.
Trial.
The Chinese were repatriated only in February 1920. From the end of the war on 11 November 1918 they remained in camp at De Clijte, near Poperinge, Belgium. They drank, they gambled, they fought, they assaulted women, and they stole. Historian Brian C. Fawcett said: "Invariably gambling was rife and, on pay days, some debts could not be honoured. Fighting ensued and some killed their companions as a result, eventually paying the price by being shot at dawn." Ten members of the corps were executed for murder.
Wang Jungzhi killed another Chinese labourer in the camp in February 1919. He fled but was caught by military police on the French coast at Le Havre, where he was trying to find a ship. The police brought him back to Poperinge, where he was tried on 19 April 1919. He was shot at 4.24am on 8 May 1919. Records say he was executed in the courtyard of the town hall, but the researchers Piet Chielens and Julian Putkowski say it had been returned to civilian use by then.
The execution pole on display in Poperinge is said to have been used only once, for Wang Jungzhi's execution.
Burial place.
Wang Jungzhi is buried in plot II.O.54 in the Old Military Cemetery in Poperinge. His headstone, in English and Chinese, includes the inscription "A good reputation endures for ever."

Begonia pearcei

Begonia pearcei is a plant in the begonia family, Begoniaceae. It was introduced to Europe in 1864 by Richard Pearce (after whom it was named) who discovered it in the Bolivian Andes and is important in the hybridising of the "Begonia × tuberhybrida" begonias, the first of which appeared in 1867. 
Description.
This begonia is still grown today, and has dark green leaves with a velvety texture and very marked veins. The small, bright yellow flowers add interest, as it is the only yellow among the tuberous species. Its introduction into the breeding programmes led to today's yellow-flowered forms.
The description in "Hortus Veitchii" reads: The plant is of tufted habit, has the unusual quality of possessing ornamental foliage and showy flowers. The leaves are dark velvety green above, traversed by straw-coloured veins: the under surface dark red with the exception of a prominent venation. Well above the handsome leaves are borne the bright yellow flowers, usually three in number, on slender scapes.

The lead vocals are performed by guitarist Steve Lukather. Cheryl Lynn provided the female backing vocal.
The song is still performed on tour. It is adapted with improvisational solos on guitar and keyboards.
In a 1988 interview with Modern Drummer, Jeff Porcaro discussed developing the groove for "Georgy Porgy":
""...it's imitating Paul Humphrey heavily; it's imitating Earl Palmer very heavily. When it comes to that groove, my biggest influences were Paul Humphrey, Ed Greene, Earl Palmer, and the godfather of that 16th-note groove, James Gadson. That "Georgy Porgy" groove I owe to them.""
Cover versions.
A version by US soul band Charme was released in 1979 featuring an uncredited vocal by Luther Vandross. The single was re-released a few years later after the vocalist's rise in popularity and he was then credited as the featured artist. It remains a popular version in rare groove circles.
US disco/jazz-funk band Side Effect released their own version in 1980. It was on their "After The Rain" album. It made it to 77 in the US R&B charts. 
In 1999, a cover version by Eric Benét (with Faith Evans on background vocals) was released as the first single from Benét's album "A Day in the Life". Their version reached number two in New Zealand.
MC Lyte used this song as the musical foundation of "Poor Georgie", from her 1991 album "Act Like You Know".
The song was used by Devin the Dude in his song "Georgy" from album "The Dude (Devin the Dude album)" and by Guru in "Kissed the World" from album "" also.
In 2002, Japanese musician Ringo Sheena formed the band Yokoshima (邪) solely to play cover of Georgy Porgy. 
In 2005, guitarist Nils offered a rendition of this song from his popular Contemporary jazz radio Baja/TSR Records released album, 'Pacific Coast Highway.'

Augusto Teixeira de Freitas

Augusto Teixeira de Freitas (1816–1883) was a prominent Brazilian jurist whose prolific writings inspired all South American private law codifications.
After studies at Olinda and São Paulo, Teixeira de Freitas practiced law as an advocate and jurisconsult. As president of the Order of Advocates and legal counsel to the State Council of the Empire of Brazil, he composed the first systematic compilation of Brazilian civil law ("Consolidação das Leis Civis", 1857), which served "in lieu" of a civil code effectively until 1916. 
His "magnum opus", the "Esboço de Código Civil" (1860-64), a draft civil code, remained incomplete after 4,908 articles had been written, at which point the government released the exhausted jurist from his commission. The "Esboço" was nonetheless a pioneering work and constituted the basis of later codifications in Brazil, Argentina and the rest of South America.

Secrets of the Furious Five

Secrets of the Furious Five is an American animated short produced by DreamWorks Animation, which serves as a semi-sequel or spin-off to the animated feature film "Kung Fu Panda" and appears on a companion disc of the original film's deluxe DVD release. It was later broadcast on NBC on February 26, 2009 and is now available as a separate DVD as of March 24, 2009.
The film has a framing story of Po the Dragon Warrior (in computer animation) telling the stories of his comrades in arms, the Furious Five, which are depicted in 2D cel animation, similar to the opening and credits of the original film.
The only actors from the film to reprise their roles in this short were Jack Black as Po, Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu, David Cross as Crane, and Randall Duk Kim as Master Oogway. Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen do not reprise their roles mainly because their related characters are depicted as their younger selves.
In this short, Monkey is voiced by Jaycee Chan, son of Jackie Chan. Jaycee Chan also voiced Crane in the Cantonese version of the original film.
Production of the film was outsourced to Reel FX Creative Studios, who worked on CG animation, and to Film Roman, who worked on traditionally animated sequences.
Synopsis.
Po (Jack Black) is assigned by Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to teach an introduction to Kung Fu class for a group of rambunctious rabbit children. Fortunately for Po, it doesn't take him long to bring the class to order and for the kids to calm down, and begins to emphasize to the kids that combat is not the only part of what Kung Fu is about, while its true meaning is "excellence of self." To illustrate his point, he uses the stories of the Furious Five's individual pasts and the basic philosophical concepts they learned that enabled them to be great Kung Fu masters.
Mantis.
In his youth, Mantis was a petulantly impatient warrior who was prone to jumping to conclusions and making impulsive decisions. When this habit got himself captured by crocodile bandits, the long wait he was forced to endure in his cage allowed him to find the "patience" to play dead long enough to ambush his captors.
Viper.
Viper, the daughter of Great Master Viper, was born without venomous fangs. Her father, who relied on his venomous bite to protect the village, was despondent that she could never succeed him as a warrior, making her feel timid. One day during a festival, Great Master Viper encountered a gorilla bandit who wore armor hard enough to shatter his fangs when he tried to bite him. Seeing her father in peril, Viper found the "courage" to fight the bandit and defeat him with her ribbon dancing skills.
Crane.
Crane was an unconfident janitor of a Kung Fu academy until the star pupil Mei Ling encouraged him to seek enrollment in the school. Even though his nerve failed him at the tryouts, Crane accidentally stumbled into the intimidating challenge that determined eligibility and suddenly found the "confidence" to take the challenge, with his skinny body proving to be an asset that enabled him to succeed.
Tigress.
Tigress was an orphan whose status as an apex predator and her destructive lack of control of her strength left her feared and isolated in the rest of the orphanage where she lived. Master Shifu came to kindly teach her the "discipline" she desperately needed to control her movements until she could perform delicate tasks with ease enough to allay the concerns of the orphanage and the kids that lived there. When she was again rejected for adoption by the adults who were still scared of her, Master Shifu took her in as his student and foster daughter.
Monkey.
Monkey was a troublemaker who tormented his village owing to him being publicly humiliated in his youth. He defied all attempts to force him to leave until Master Oogway confronted him and defeated him in a fight, deducing the cause of his anti-social behavior. Rather than making him leave the village as per the challenge, Oogway told him to stay and encouraged him to show "compassion" to others, as he would want in similar circumstances.
Conclusion.
At the end, Master Shifu returns to see Po's anticipated lack of progress teaching and he's surprised that he underestimated Po's talents yet again, considering how much the panda's students have learned. But when the bunnies ask Po how his first day of Kung Fu was, all the unpleasant memories during the original film flash through his head; he then proudly says, "It was totally awesome!"
Awards.
"Secrets of the Furious Five" has received eight nominations in the "Animated Television Production or Short Form" category at the 36th Annie Awards, of which it received four ("Character Animation," "Character Design," "Music," and "Production Design").
Controversy.
The individual DVD release has received much criticism from consumers confusing it for a feature length production. The UK DVD release is described on the packaging as "The Next Kung Fu Panda Adventure", implying that it is a sequel to the first as opposed to a spin-off.

David Combe

David Combe (born 26 April 1943) was National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, a political consultant and lobbyist, an Australian Trade Commissioner, a Senior Vice President International of Southcorp Wines, and a consultant to the Australian Wine Industry.
Early life.
Harvey David Mathew Combe was born in 1943 in Adelaide, South Australia and was educated at Prince Alfred College and the University of Adelaide (B.A.). He became interested in politics at university and joined the ALP, partly through his friendship with Don Dunstan. (He has been Patron of the Don Dunstan Foundation since 2004.)
Career.
Combe was national secretary of the Australian Labor Party (1973–1981), a political consultant and lobbyist (1981–1985), an Australian senior trade commissioner (1985–1991), and has held senior executive and board positions within the Australian wine industry (1991–2008).
Politics.
After completing an arts degree at the University of Adelaide, Combe became active in Labor Party affairs in South Australia. He moved to Canberra and in 1973 became the youngest serving National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party after the election of the first Labor government for 23 years. In November 1975, he was allegedly co-instigator, with Gough Whitlam and Bill Hartley, of an (unsuccessful) approach to Saddam Hussein's Iraq for a $US500,000 gift to help fund Labor's 1975 election campaign. Labor lost the 1975 election. He propagated the notion that Labor's defeat in the election had been contributed to by CIA interference, and wrote an article on the subject which appeared in "The Bulletin" in January 1982.
Combe remained National Secretary until July 1981, at which time he resigned to establish his own lobbying business, David Combe and Associates Pty Ltd. The business reportedly "received a great fillip in March 1983, when the Labor Party was re-elected to office. Business perceived Combe as the most influential lobbyist then working in Canberra".
Combe-Ivanov affair.
In 1983, he was accused of compromising Australia's national security in dealings with Soviet diplomat Valery Ivanov.
"Australian-Soviet Trade" pp.227-228, 
"The Third Man - Lawrence Matheson" pp228-230 and 
"The Rise and Fall of David Combe" pp230-234.
The rest of the chapter discusses "ASIO and the Combe-Ivanov affair" and "Justice Hope's Royal Commission".</ref> 
The so-called "Combe-Ivanov affair" developed out of a trip Combe and his wife made to the USSR in 1982, in the course of preparations for which they met and developed a relationship with the First Secretary for the USSR Embassy in Canberra, Valery Ivanov. Soon after the formation of the Hawke government, ASIO raised concerns that Combe, closely aligned to the ALP, might be being compromised by a Soviet citizen with KGB links. Ivanov was expelled from Australia in 1983 by Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
The highly publicised events were investigated by the Hope Royal Commission into Australia's security and intelligence agencies of 1983-1984, which found that Combe had indeed been targeted by the Soviets. Although targeted, there was no proof of intelligence breaches, nor security threats to the country. There were several cartoons that portray the commission as a kangaroo court.
Trade commissioner.
He was Australia's senior trade commissioner in Western Canada from 1985 to 1989, and in Hong Kong from 1990 to 1991.
Wine industry.
Combe is credited with developing significant export business for Southcorp Wines from August 1991 to June 2000, during which time exports increased from $40 million annually to $300 million. Combe was Senior Vice President International and ran the European operations of Penfolds and Southcorp Wines during the rise of Australian Wines in the 1990s. 
In the year 2000. he was named "Australia's Top Export Salesmen" by "Overseas Trading" magazine and was included in the "Twenty Five Most Influential Australians in Asia" list published by "Business Asia" magazine, 2000. 
From March 2001 to November 2003, he joined Western Australian wine producer Evans and Tate Limited as a non-executive director with a view to providing strategic input and guidance in an ambitious acquisition programme. 
In 2004, in a speech at Bordeaux, he lambasted the wine-purchasing policies of UK supermarkets which "if committed in Australia, would represent major breaches of the trade practices laws". 
In June 2004 he was appointed chairman of Simon Gilbert Wines, He retired as a director and chairman in February 2007, "to take up another position within the wine industry".
Portrait.
In 1983, Keith Looby painted Combe's portrait. The portrait was an unsuccessful entry in the Archibald Prize of 1983, and conspiracy theories on this matter abound. David Combe said in 1998 that there was 'circumstantially a good case to believe that some trustees were heavied by the Party' into rejecting the work. In 1998, Combe donated his portrait to the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra, "through the Australian Government's Cultural Gifts Program".

SIMPLE algorithm

In computational fluid dynamics (CFD), SIMPLE algorithm is a widely used numerical procedure to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. "SIMPLE" is an acronym for Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations.
The SIMPLE algorithm was developed by Prof. Brian Spalding and his student Suhas Patankar at Imperial College, London in the early 1970s. Since then it has been extensively used by many researchers to solve different kinds of fluid flow and heat transfer problems. 
Many popular books on computational fluid dynamics discuss the SIMPLE algorithm in detail. This algorithm forms the basis of Commercial CFD packages.
A modified variant is the "SIMPLER" algorithm (SIMPLE Revised), that was introduced by Patankar in 1979.
Algorithm.
The algorithm is iterative. The basic steps in the solution update are as follows:

Jan den Uyl

Jan Jansz. den Uyl (Utrecht (?), 1595/96 – 24 November 1639) was a painter of the Dutch Golden Age. He very much specialized in the form of still life known as the breakfast piece, or, in the elaborate style of painters like den Uyl, banquet pieces ("banketjestukken"). He also painted landscapes and animal paintings.
Den Uyl was well known in his time, and Peter Paul Rubens owned three of his paintings. Although den Uyl is nowadays comparatively unknown, one of his paintings, in the collection of Gerald Guterman, has been called the "most beautifully perfect Dutch monochrome still-life in existence".
The Dutch word "uyl" means "owl", and den Uyl always included the signature motif of an owl in his paintings, often more than once in a single picture. Sometimes the motif is obvious and sometimes it is more covert. For example, in his "Breakfast Still Life with Glass and Metalwork" (1637–39), in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, an owl is incorporated fairly obviously as the decorative finial on a large flagon, but the reflections in the pewter plates are also reminiscent of the face of an owl.
He trained Jan Jansz. Treck and married his sister in 1619.

McCloud Railway No. 25 is a 2-6-2 locomotive that worked on the McCloud River Railroad. It was purchased new from the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in 1925.
On July 3, 1955, the locomotive was the one that ceremoniously opened the Burney Branch by bursting through a paper banner with a special excursion train. At some point after this, the locomotive was retired.
In 1962, No. 25 was restored for excursion service, and served in that capacity until passenger service was once again terminated in 1975.
The 25 was one of four Prairies from ALCO, numbered 22–25, which were purchased for a total cost of $90,000. The 25 was the largest and last steam locomotive purchased by the McCloud River Railroad. At the time, the McCloud was a logging railway, and the 25 was used in this function until June 1955, when it was replaced by GE 70-ton switcher No. 1.
It wasn't long, however, before the locomotive was brought out again on July 3, 1955 to open the Burney Branch by breaking a paper banner with a special excursion train. After this, however, the locomotive was truly retired, but it remained on the property—the only steam locomotive to do so.
In the following years, there were many requests for the 25 to be restored for excursion service. This was finally done in 1962. The locomotive ran special excursions, usually for railfan organizations. A contractor called the Mt. Shasta Alpine Scenic Railway ran regular excursions in the summer of 1964, and another contractor called the Shasta Huffen-Puff ran the service between 1967 and 1971, when equipment prices, insurance prices, and falling interest.
This era of excursions ended in 1975, when the locomotive travelled to the Tidewater Southern Railway to be used in "Bound for Glory". After that, it was retired for the second time.
The McCloud River Railroad came under new ownership in 1977, and the new owners ordered President Bill Herndon to scrap the 25, but he resisted.
Beginning in late spring of 1982, the 25 was put on long-term lease to the Great Western Railroad Museum, which ran it on the McCloud in several annual excursions. This third career also ended with a performance in a movie: "Stand by Me", filmed in 1986. Right after this, the Great Western Railroad Museum sued the McCloud River Railroad for Breach of Contract, and in the settlement, obtained possession of the locomotive. They did not do anything with it, however, keeping it in storage on the McCloud property.
The renewed McCloud Railway re-obtained the 25 in January 1996 and began restoration efforts. The locomotive's fourth career began on Labor Day in 1997. No. 25 again returned to occasional excursion service, but in February 2001, McCloud Railway 18 reentered service, and after a doubleheader excursion, the 18 replaced the 25. The 25 was stored again, and it was restored once again between the summer of 2007 and the summer of 2008. It made two excursions for railfan groups on November 1 and 2, but because most of the McCloud Railway is being abandoned, the locomotive ran on its homerails for the last time, and was put up for sale.
In late March, 2011, 25 was moved from McCloud, California to Tillamook, Oregon after it was purchased by the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad. The locomotive is stored in the World War II-era blimp hangar and was steamed up on May 20 with passenger excursions planned to begin in the summer.

Deutscher Radfahrer-Verband

The Deutscher Radfahrer-Verband (DRV), "German Cycling Association", was the cycling unit of the Nazi Sports Office. 
History.
Cycling associations existed in Germany since 1884. On that year the Bund Deutscher Radfahrer (BDR), "German Cycling Federation", was established in the city of Leipzig. Later other cycling associations or clubs were founded, many of which were active and successful.
After the Enabling Act of 1933, which legally gave Hitler dictatorial control of Germany, all existing cycling associations were called to split up on their own (Selbstauflösung) before the first semester of 1933 was over. They were then invited to join the Deutscher Radfahrer-Verband, which was the corresponding branch or unit (Fachamt) created by the Nazi Sports office. 
On May 31, 1945, after Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. Known as "Law number five", this Denazification decree disbanded the Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen along with all its facilities and departments, which included the Deutscher Radfahrer-Verband.
The "German Cycling Federation" was reestablished on 21 November 1948 in West Germany. 
In East Germany the cycling section of the Deutscher Sportausschuss, the DDR's sports body, was established in 1946.

Frome state by-election, 2009

A by-election was held for the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Frome on 17 January 2009. This was triggered by the resignation of former Premier and state Liberal MHA Rob Kerin. The seat had been retained by the Liberals at the 2006 state election on a 3.4 per cent margin, and at the 2002 state election on an 11.5 per cent margin. 
The writ for the by-election was issued on 28 November, with the rolls closing on 8 December. Candidate nominations closed 18 December at midday.
Independent candidate Geoff Brock ended up winning the seat from the Liberals in a very close contest.
Background.
Kerin was first elected as the member for the new rural seat of Frome at the 1993 state election. From 1995 he held various ministries in the Brown and Olsen Liberal governments until he became Premier of South Australia in October 2001, before losing government to the Mike Rann-led Labor Party at the March 2002 state election. When the party went into opposition, Kerin remained Liberal leader until after the 2006 state election when he resigned the leadership to make way for Iain Evans.
The by-election was the first to be held for a state seat in South Australia since the November 1994 by-election for Taylor, when another former Premier, Lynn Arnold, retired from politics.
Candidates.
Nominations in ballot order were:
The Family First Party and the Australian Democrats, who ran candidates in the previous election, polling 5.2 percent and 2 percent respectively, did not nominate a candidate to contest the by-election.
Issues.
Of concern to the electorate was the potential closure of the Nyrstar smelter in Port Pirie due to the federal government's emissions trading scheme known as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, however it won special exemption from the scheme on 17 December.
Port Pirie Mayor and Independent candidate Geoff Brock was considered a possibility for winning the seat, with a strong local profile, and receiving preference recommendations in how-to-vote cards (HTVs) from Labor and the Nationals, whilst the Greens did not recommend preferences. Brock's own HTV recommended preferences to the Nationals, Labor, Liberal, Green, and One Nation, in that order. Independent Senator Nick Xenophon also campaigned for Brock.
Results.
The by-election was closely contested, with the result being uncertain for over a week. Initial reports suggested a slight swing to the Liberal candidate Terry Boylan on the two-party preferred count against Labor, but with Independent candidate Geoff Brock not far behind Labor. By 21 January 2009, both the ABC's Antony Green and the State Electoral Office were indicating a two percent swing against the Liberals toward Labor, but not enough to lose the seat. Liberal leader Martin Hamilton-Smith claimed victory on behalf of the party.
The result hinged on the performance of Brock against Labor in the competition for second place. Brock polled best in the Port Pirie area, and received enough eliminated candidate preferences to end up ahead of the Labor candidate by 30 votes. 
Brock received 80 percent of Labor's fifth count preferences to achieve a two-candidate preferred vote of 51.72 percent (a majority of 665 votes) against the Liberal candidate, despite a slight improvement in the Liberal primary vote since the previous count. This was announced by the Electoral Commissioner, Kay Mousley, at 8:30 pm local time on 24 January 2009, but without a formal declaration. The commissioner rejected a request for a recount by Boylan, with a formal request being lodged by the Liberal Party, which was also rejected, after which the Liberals ruled out a possibility of taking the result to the Court of Disputed Returns. A formal declaration of the by-election outcome was made by the State Electoral Office on 29 January. The by-election saw a rare two-party swing to an incumbent government, and was the first time an opposition had lost a seat at a by-election in South Australia. The result in Frome at the 2010 state election saw Brock increase his primary vote by 14.1 percent to a total of 37.7 percent and his two-candidate vote by 6.5 percent to a total of 58.2 percent. Despite a statewide swing against Labor at the election, Labor again increased its two-party vote in Frome by 1.8 percent to a total of 50.1 percent, coincidentally by 30 votes.

List of Knight's Cross recipients 4th SS Polizei Panzer Grenadier Division

The SS Polizei Division was one of the thirty-eight divisions fielded as part of the "Waffen-SS" during World War II.
The division was formed in 1939 as part of the SS-controlled Regular Police, and was transferred to the "Waffen-SS" in 1942. After a variety of splits and reunions it was eventually upgraded to a "Panzergrenadier" division, the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division. It surrendered to the Americans at the end of the war.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573" of September 1, 1939 instituted the Iron Cross and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. As the war progressed some of the recipients distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849" of June 3, 1940. In 1941 two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613" of September 28, 1941 introduced the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the last and final grade, the Knight's Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11" of December 29, 1944 concluded the variants of the Knight's Cross.
Prerequisites.
To qualify for the Knight's Cross, a soldier had to already hold the 1939 Iron Cross First Class, though the Iron Cross I Class was awarded concurrently with the Knight's Cross in rare cases.
Unit commanders could also be awarded the medal for exemplary conduct by the unit as a whole.
Grades.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was divided into five grades, excluding the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross:

Adam Neate

Adam Neate (born 1977) is a British painter, conceptual artist and described by "The Telegraph" in 2008 as "one of the world's best-known street artists". He specialised in painting urban art on recycled cardboard, and has left thousands of works in the street for anyone to collect. He is a contributor from the movement in transferring street art into galleries. Neate's street art has garnered global interest, having been documented on CNN reports and European television. Major collectors and celebrities are fighting for his original works and international critics have lauded the artist's work.
Since 2011 Neate has been mastering his own language of 'Dimensional Painting'. 
Early years.
Adam Neate was born in Colchester, Essex and grew up in Ipswich, Suffolk. In the mid-1980s, aged nine or ten, he became familiar with graffiti art through a cousin, who was interested in it. Neate watched VHS videos about graffiti, as well as groups such as the Beastie Boys and hip-hop music. Then he borrowed books like "Spray Can Art" and "Subway Art" from the library: he was attracted by the colourful quality of the artwork, which he wanted to emulate. 
He did not study painting, but graduated in design at Suffolk College, then moved to London and took a job as a graphic designer at Glue London, a digital advertising agency.
Technique.
He also took up painting, which he had long wanted to do. Using aerosols and found objects, he painted on cardboard boxes, which he collected from the street, avoiding the use of canvas because of its cost. His work can have two and three-dimensional qualities, as he tears the material, builds it in layers and staples pieces together, mainly making figurative images, which include self-portraits and portraits of friends.
In an essay in December 2012, art historian Ben Jones wrote "In Adam Neate’s most recent work, space itself becomes the medium. The accumulated plasticity of Cubism’s two distinct phases has been re-energised by Neate’s own distinctive mode: Dimensional Materialism. To get the full multi-dimensional effect, the viewer is asked to activate their own viewing space ...as you move and change vantage point, negative space is held in balance, unleashed, then restrained again. The image resolves itself. Foreground to background shifting, space dissolving, volume folds in, energy pushes out ...Neate’s compositions are mapped by sensations of simultaneity. Multiple moments of past experience are elided with a slowed down and extended present moment."
Street Work.
He gave away works to friends, but built up an excess and left them wrapped in bin liners outside charity shops as a donation. When he discovered that they were not being sold, but thrown out with the rubbish, he started to leave them in the streets instead, with works leaning on lampposts, doors and wheelie bins, as an open exhibition, which looked "really surreal". He could produce around 20 paintings a night, and around 1,000 a year. Over a five-year period, he left thousands of his works in London streets.
He had kept away from galleries, but was contacted by Elms Lesters, who wanted to show his work. Neate took up the invitation, but decided to do different work from his street art and develop other techniques and styles. In March 2007, journalist Max Foster picked up on Neate's work and was the first to report on him. In August 2007, at Elms Lesters Painting Rooms in London, he had a solo show, which sold out within hours of opening. He was described as a pioneer of the new movement which shows street art in conventional art galleries.
Following this he was able to give up his job. In December 2007, his painting "Suicide Bomber" sold for £78,500 at Sotheby's.
On 14 November 2008, in an event "The London Show", he and helpers left 1,000 prints, worth a total of £1 million, around London streets for anyone to pick up and keep. When night came, the first teams started in the outer southern boroughs, Bromley, Bexley and Merton, and worked their way to the centre, covering all 32 boroughs and the City of London, and finishing in the early hours. Work was left in doorways and against shop windows. 
Some of the work quickly appeared on Ebay with starting prices ranging from 99p to £1,000; Neate had no objection to such sales, and thought it might help some people out for Christmas. He said, "It has always been a dream of mine to do a show around the whole of London, to take over the whole city in one go. I want everybody to be able to see it, but once the pieces are out there I don't mind what happens to them." 
The works were screen prints on cardboard of a man, with stamping, each being slightly different, and protected in a cellophane wrapper; Andy Warhol provided the precedent for industrial style production. Neate created the master image in a stencil, and thereafter did not touch the prints, which were made by a professional screen printer. They were rubber-stamped with his signature. Neate wished to overcome boundaries between product, print and painting: 
"I’m interested in that Warhol idea of the brands as assisted readymade." He said, "The whole concept of the free art thing was challenging the notion of art as a commodity and its worth in society. Now I’m taking that to another level, testing the viability of separating art from commerce." His work is technically expert and has won him acknowledgement from the Tate, National Portrait Gallery and The National Gallery and various sell out shows at The Elms Lester Gallery. He is continually challenging his work, often quoting Picasso “To copy oneself is more dangerous than to copy others. It leads to sterility"
His work has gained recognition from the National Gallery, the Tate, and the National Portrait Gallery. He has expressed an interest in exploring sculpture and photography, as well as in travel to America and Venice.
Influences.
Neate cites his influences as his wife, Waleska, New York graffiti artist, Daze, and Picasso.

Jonah Paffhausen

Metropolitan Jonah (born James Paffhausen Jr., October 20, 1959) is an American Orthodox retired bishop who served as the primate of the Orthodox Church in America (OCA) with the title "The Most Blessed Archbishop of Washington, Metropolitan of All America and Canada" from his election on November 12, 2008 until his resignation on July 7, 2012. Metropolitan Jonah was the first convert to the Orthodox faith to have been elected as the Primate of the OCA.
Life.
James Paffhausen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to James and Louise Paffhausen. He was baptized into the Episcopal Church at St. Chrysostom's Episcopal Church. He continued attending a parish of TEC after his family relocated to La Jolla, California. It was not until age 18 that Jonah began preparation for Chrismation in a San Diego Orthodox parish of the Moscow Patriarchate. In 1978, he was received into the Orthodox Church at Our Lady of Kazan Church (Moscow Patriarchate) while studying at the University of California, San Diego. James later transferred to UC Santa Cruz and helped to establish an Orthodox Christian Fellowship chapter there.
After graduation from UCSC, James went on to study at St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, graduating in 1985 with an M.Div. and again in 1988 with an M.Th. in Dogmatic Theology. In 1989, he began doctoral studies at Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California, but interrupted his studies to spend a year in Russia, working for "Russkiy Palomnik" in the publishing arm of the Moscow Patriarchate. During his time in Russia, he was introduced to Russian spirituality and its particular form of monastic life.
He subsequently joined Valaam Monastery as a novice, coming under the spiritual direction of Archimandrite Pankratiy (Zherdev), the monastery's abbot, now a titular bishop of Troitsk. While in Russia, James was taken to see Fr. Pankratiy's own spiritual father, Elder Kyrill of Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra to ask for advice in discerning his vocation. Elder Kyrill blessed James to become a hieromonk.
In 1994, James was ordained to the diaconate and priesthood, and then in the following year, he was tonsured a monastic at St Tikhon's Monastery, South Canaan, Pennsylvania, receiving the name Jonah after St. Jonah of Moscow.
Hieromonk Jonah returned to his home state of California and was initially assigned as the priest of the mission parish, St Mary Magdalene of Merced, California. While serving there he worked in conjunction with Father Jon Magoulias of the GOA parish in Modesto, California to establish a mission parish under the auspices of the OCA in the Sonora/Jamestown/Columbia area of California; this mission began its life meeting in the old historical Roman Catholic church of Saint Anna in the gold rush town of Columbia. Then Father Jonah began the move to establish a mission parish in Chico, California. His desire, though, in the midst of these activities was to establish a monastic brotherhood and he was given the obedience to establish a monastery at the Saint Eugene's retreat at Point Reyes, California by his bishop, Tikhon (Fitzgerald). In late 1996, St. John of San Francisco Monastery was founded in Point Reyes, California. During his tenure as abbot, Fr. Jonah's monastic community grew to more than fifteen members, and the monastery soon had to move to larger facilities in Manton. In this period, he continued to work with mission parishes in Chico, Eureka and Susanville, California and in the Kona District, Hawaii.
Episcopal elevation.
In 2008, Fr. Jonah was elevated to the rank of archimandrite and sent from the monastery to take on the duties of being an auxiliary bishop for the Orthodox Church in America's Diocese of the South. In September of that year, he was officially elected to that position, and then on November 1 consecrated in Dallas as Bishop of Fort Worth, led by Archbishop Dmitri (Royster), then "locum tenens" of the OCA's Metropolitan See. Eleven days later, on November 12, Bishop Jonah was elected as Metropolitan of the Orthodox Church in America.
Jonah's election as Metropolitan was regarded by observers as an extraordinary occurrence in the history of the OCA, as he was the newest bishop in the OCA at the time. Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) had retired three months prior to the OCA's Fifteenth All-American Council, in connection with the financial scandal. The vacancy meant that a new Metropolitan would have to be elected at the Council. On the night before the election, the Synod asked Jonah to address questions from the delegates regarding the recent financial scandal in the OCA. Jonah was only an auxiliary bishop at the time, and that for only ten days, but he was the only bishop at the time who was seen as untainted by the scandal.
In his largely-improvised address, Jonah heavily criticized how he had seen authority exercised by bishops and the OCA administration in the past. He stated that hierarchical authority in the Orthodox Church should be about responsibility, accountability, and spiritual fatherhood, rather than "imperial aristocracy". He admitted that there had been a catastrophic leadership failure in the OCA, but told the assembly that clinging to bitterness over the situation would only do further harm, and that church members had to learn to forgive in order to heal. The following morning, Jonah received the most votes from the council delegates in two rounds of voting, and was subsequently elected by the Holy Synod to be the new Metropolitan.
Metropolitan Jonah was formally installed to his see of Washington and New York at St. Nicholas Cathedral, Washington, D.C., on December 28, 2008. Several months later, the Synod voted to restore a previous arrangement of having Washington as the principal city of the Metropolitan's diocese, and establishing New York as a separate diocese. Jonah served as the locum tenens of New York until the diocese enthroned its own bishop in 2010.
In accordance with Orthodox canon law and the OCA Statute, which stipulate that a diocesan bishop must live within the geographic boundaries of his diocese, Jonah maintained his residence and office in Washington, D.C., while regularly working at the OCA headquarters in Syosset, New York.
Activities.
In November 2009, Jonah signed an ecumenical statement known as the "" calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.
Regarding ecumenical relations with non-Orthodox jurisdictions and Christian denominations, Jonah severed contacts with The Episcopal Church, due to their acceptance of same-sex relationships, turning to support the Anglican Church in North America. Furthermore, he has expressed a desire to establish full communion between the OCA and the ACNA. Jonah supported the creation of the ACNA, addressing his assembly in 2009.
From February 25 to April 24, 2011 Metropolitan Jonah took a retreat for personal and spiritual renewal with the blessing of the OCA Holy Synod. Archbishop Nathaniel of Detroit assisted in temporary administration of the OCA during Jonah's retreat.
In 2011 and extending into 2012, Jonah presided at or participated in several events of historical significance in the Orthodox Church. These included a February 2011 concelebration with Metropolitan Hilarion (Alfeyev) of Volokolamsk and Archbishop Justinian (Ovchinnikov) of Naro-Fominsk in St. Nicholas Cathedral in New York City. In that same month, Jonah also met Metropolitan Christopher of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, as well as Patriarch Irinej of Serbia.
In May and December 2011, Jonah concelebrated with Metropolitan Hilarion (Kapral) of ROCOR. These were the first concelebrations between hierarchs of the OCA and ROCOR. The May liturgy was the first concelebration between the Primate and First Hierarch of the respective churches, and the December liturgy involved many more bishops from both Synods.
In August 2011, Jonah was to have journeyed to Prague to visit the Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, but cancelled his portion of the trip in order to tend to the dying Archbishop Dmitri (Royster) of Dallas. Bishop Benjamin (Peterson), who was to have accompanied Jonah, traveled to Prague in his stead.
Also in August 2011, Jonah's first book was published by St. Vladimir's Seminary Press. Titled "Reflections on a Spiritual Journey", the book is a collection of several of Jonah's writings, speeches, and interviews, both from his time as abbot and mission priest as well as after his election as Metropolitan.
On January 1, 2012, Jonah presided at the Divine Liturgy at a ROCOR parish, St. John the Baptist in Washington, DC, with the blessing of Metropolitan Hilarion (Kapral). This was the first time an OCA bishop had led Divine Liturgy at a ROCOR parish, in the absence of any ROCOR bishops. Several OCA and ROCOR priests concelebrated on this historic occasion.
Resignation.
On July 6, 2012, Metropolitan Jonah tendered his resignation as Primate of the Orthodox Church in America. The agreement with the Holy Synod of the OCA regarding his retirement has been reached on May 27, 2013, during a meeting at St. Tikhon's Monastery with Metropolitan Tikhon, the current primate of the OCA, and other Synod members.

Time Unlimited

Time Unlimited is a record label that specializes in the production of trance music based out of Hannover, Germany.
The label was founded and established by Joachim Keil in September 1992. Time Unlimited was the first of the Under Cover Music Group UCMG Germany family of labels. The label was relaunched in 2007 by Marc Steinmeier.
The Label was founded to release hi-quality electronic music specializing in Hard and Progressive Trance. Originally distributed by MMS in Germany, later on by Intergroove across Europe.
Home label for a variety of successful trance producers, most notably Bernd Augustinski (Nostrum), but also releasing multiple releases from Andreas Kettenbach (Roughage), Marc Steinmeier (Overcharge & Nuclear Hyde), Michael Kores (Albion), and Roger Beglinger (DJ Energy).
The task to define the sound of Time Unlimited today borders on sheer impossibility. Time moves in the realm of electronic Music (trance, progressive house & ambient). Since 2004 is Time Unlimited a part of Daredo labelgroup.
In August 2008, Time Unlimited and the German sample & sound design company Ueberschall launched the "Trance ID 2" remix contest. The winner was guaranteed a release on the Time Unlimited label. The international producers that provided the construction kits on the "Trance ID 2" sample pack included Time Unlimited's Mike Koglin, Marc Steinmeier, Darren Tate, and Mark Pledger.

Souss-Massa National Park

The Souss-Massa National Park (Parc National de Souss-Massa) is a 33,800 hectare national park on the Atlantic coast of Morocco which was created in 1991. It lies between Agadir to the north and Sidi Ifni to the south and its centre is at 9°40'W 30°5'N. The estuary of the Oued Souss is the northern limit of the park, and that of the Oued Massa is near the southern end. 30,000 ha of land near Aglou, south of the park, is also included in the site because it is sometimes used as a feeding area by the Northern Bald Ibis. The habitat is grazed steppe with dunes, beaches and wetlands. The soil is mainly sandy with some rockier areas.
Fauna.
The park's main conservation importance is that it holds three of the four Moroccan colonies of the Northern Bald Ibis "Geronticus eremita". Together with the fourth site at nearby Tamri, it holds 95% of the world's truly wild breeding birds of this endangered species. The ibis colonies and roost-sites are located on coastal cliffs within the National Park, and the coastal steppes and fields are used as feeding areas. The park has a nature trail at Oued Souss and a visitor centre at Oued Massa.
The Oued Massa holds water throughout the year and has breeding Marbled Ducks, a globally threatened species. It is the only known Moroccan breeding site for the Glossy Ibis. The two estuaries are important for migrants, especially waders and gulls. European Spoonbill and Audouin's Gull winter in the park. Other notable breeding bird species are Red-necked Nightjar, Thick-billed Lark, Tristram's Warbler and Moussier's Redstart.
Souss-Massa also holds captive-breeding programmes for four threatened North African ungulates: Scimitar Oryx, Addax, Dama gazelle and Dorcas gazelle, that are kept in separate enclosures within the park. The reintroduction of the Ostrich - which is extinct north of the Sahara - is also underway.
Threats.
The park is threatened by increasing pressures of the growing human population and the construction of summer chalets is increasing around Aglou. A large-scale hotel development planned for the coast at Tifnit, an area that includes important feeding areas for the Bald Ibis, has been suspended.
International Cooperation.
In regard to international cooperation and exchanges, the Souss-Massa National Park has received technical support from the Teide National Park (Tenerife, Spain).

Luc Adamo Matéta

Luc Daniel Adamo Matéta (born October 1949) is a Congolese politician and the President of the Union for the Reconstruction and Development of the Congo (URDC). He was a Minister-Delegate in the government of Congo-Brazzaville from 1995 to 1997, and he was briefly Minister of the Budget and the Coordination of Financial Administration in 1997. Matéta was a candidate in the 2002 presidential election and has been High Commissioner for Civic Instruction and Moral Education since 2002.
Political career.
Born in Kitamba in 1949, Matéta studied in the Soviet Union. He worked at the statistics department of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, and was an early member of the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI), led by Bernard Kolélas. In the 1992 parliamentary election, he was elected to the National Assembly as an MCDDI candidate in the Pool Region. After Kolélas reached an agreement with President Pascal Lissouba, Matéta was one of the four members of the opposition who were appointed to the government on 23 January 1995; he was named Minister-Delegate for the Budget and the Coordination of Financial Administration.
In the midst of the 1997 civil war, Kolélas was appointed as Prime Minister in September 1997 and a national unity government was formed; Matéta was retained in that government and promoted to the post of Minister of the Budget and the Coordination of Financial Administration. The Kolélas government survived for only one month, however; rebels loyal to Denis Sassou Nguesso captured Brazzaville in mid-October 1997. Matéta fled into exile.
After the 1997 civil war, as fighting continued between the government of President Sassou Nguesso and "Ninja" rebels, Matéta returned to Congo-Brazzaville in 1998 and renounced armed struggle in 1999. Also in 1999, he became a member of the bureau of the Coordination Committee for the Monitoring of the Cease-Fire Agreement and was assigned responsibility for finances. Later, Matéta was appointed as the Commissioner for Project Implementation at the High Commission for the Reintegration of Former Combatants in August 2001.
Matéta left the MCDDI and created a new political party, the URDC; it was founded on 25 January 2002, and Matéta led the party as its President. He stood in the 10 March 2002 presidential election as the candidate of the Convention for Democracy and the Republic, receiving 1.59% of the vote and placing fifth. Following the election, he visited President Sassou Nguesso on 18 March and congratulated Sassou Nguesso on his victory.
Matéta stood as a URDC candidate in Mfilou, the seventh "arrondissement" of Brazzaville, in the May–June 2002 parliamentary election, but failed to win a seat. He was then appointed as High Commissioner for Civic Instruction and Moral Education on 11 October 2002.
In December 2006, a book written by Matéta, "Reflections for a New Africa" ("Réflexions pour une Afrique nouvelle"), was published.
Together with the General Movement for the Reconstruction of Congo, led by Jean-Michel Bokamba-Yangouma, Matéta's URDC formed the Coalition of Center Parties (CPC) in April 2008. Initially, Bokamba-Yangouma was President of the CPC and Matéta was its Vice-President; later, Matéta and Bokamba-Yangouma served as Co-Presidents of the CPC. As a centrist party, the URDC is not part of the opposition but is also not part of the Presidential Majority, despite Matéta's official post. It likens its views to Christian democracy. 
As High Commissioner for Civic Instruction and Moral Education, Matéta gave a talk on citizenship in the context of elections on 9 June 2009, shortly before the July 2009 presidential election. He noted the importance of exercising one's right to vote, behaving peacefully and responsibly while voting, and waiting for the announcement of results in a disciplined manner. While some opposition groups planned to boycott the election, Matéta stressed that participating in the election was a crucial civic responsibility: "abstention is an act of insubordination to the laws of the Republic, that is to say insubordination to democracy and the sovereignty of the people. Such behavior is antisocial: it denies the foundations of society and leads to chaos."
Matéta presented the second edition of the "Congolese Citizen's Guide", a book intended as a guide for the different aspects of citizenship and civic life, to the press on 21 May 2010. He said that the guide was his office's contribution to the 50th anniversary of Congolese independence.

Knox & Kane Number 58 is a China Railways SY class steam locomotive that was built in 1989 by the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works for the Knox and Kane Railroad, where it spent its life until that railroad's demise. It was recently purchased by the Valley Railroad Company.
58 ran for the Knox and Kane between 1989 and spring of 2006, when the railroad ceased all operations. In storage in an engine house in Kane, locomotive 58 and other rolling stock was subjected to an early morning arson attack on March 16, 2008. The locomotive was severely damaged, more so than its housemate, the older No. 38, which had thicker boiler skin. Its cab was lined with wood, which was utterly destroyed.
On October 10, the locomotive was purchased at a liquidation auction by the Valley Railroad. The new owners plan to restore the locomotive into the appearance of a New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad locomotive, to be numbered 3025. Restoration was completed in 2011, and the locomotive entered revenue service on November 25, 2011 pulling The North Pole Express.

Del LaGrace Volcano

Del LaGrace Volcano (born in California in 1957) is "one of instigators of polymorphous perverse queer culture." A formally trained photographer, Del's work includes installation, performance and film and interrogates the performance of gender on several levels, especially the performance of masculinity and femininity.
Life and work.
Born intersex with both male and female characteristics but raised as as female from birth, Del lived the first 37 years of his life as a woman, but since then has been living as both male and female (genderqueer).
Del earned an MA in Photographic Studies at University of Derby, UK in 1992 after studying photography at the San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco from 1979-81. Prior to Studying at San Francisco, Del attended Allan Hancock College as a student in the Visual Studies program from 1977-79.
Volcano's work complicates understandings of both femininity and masculinity by depicting lesbian masculinity. In "The Feminine Principle" Volcano takes queer femininities as a focus. Included in this project is a portrait of Kate Bornstein. In "Lesbian Boyz and Other Inverts," Volcano's celebration of butch dykes, transsexual boys and other gender-queers, masculinity is shown as a tool of subversion.
Volcano's most recent photographs demonstrate how intersexed bodies can offer an entirely new perspective on the body. The 'normal' body in relation to Volcano's photographs becomes queer. Volcano describes the bodies in his latest works as "sites of mutation, loss, and longing." In these newer works, Volcano takes on the loss of his friend, Kathy Acker and the transformation of his lover Simo Maronati's abled body into a disabled one. Here, Volcano illustrates the queerness of any body marked by illness or trauma.
Artist's statement.
"As a gender variant visual artist I access 'technologies of gender' in order to amplify rather than erase the hermaphroditic traces of my body. I name myself. A gender abolitionist. A part time gender terrorist. An intentional mutation and intersex by design, (as opposed to diagnosis), in order to distinguish my journey from the thousands of intersex individuals who have had their 'ambiguous' bodies mutilated and disfigured in a misguided attempt at 'normalization'. I believe in crossing the line as many times as it takes to build a bridge we can all walk across."
Del LaGrace Volcano, September 2005
Selected exhibitions.
Selected 1994-2005 
Publications.
Del has produced four monographs from 1991's Love Bites to Sex Works in 2005.
Della Grace. Love Bites.Gay Men's Press, London 1991
"Perhaps the first published photographic monograph of lesbian sexuality in the world made from an insider's perspective. In the early 90's LOVE BITES generated a great deal of controversy and censorship in both the mainstream and lesbian/gay media. In the USA it was banned by Customs & Excise for two weeks. In Canada they cut the most "offensive" photographs out of the book before selling it. In England it was sold by mainstream booksellers but not in lesbian or gay bookshops who protested they couldn't take the risk or disagreed with the SM content. Although it has been out of print for over 10 years it is still considered a queer classic."
Del LaGrace Volcano & Judith "Jack" Halberstam. The Drag King Book. Serpent's Tail, 1999
Del LaGrace Volcano. Sublime Mutations.Konkursbuchverlag, 2000
"Sublime Mutations, a photographic retrospective of Del LaGrace Volcano's work produced over the course of the last ten years, visually remaps the political and theoretical cutting edge of the queer avantgarde." 
In Jay Prossler's introduction, Prossler claims that through LaGrace Volcano's work "we see the changing shape of our bodies and our communities reflected". Importantly however, we also glimpse the changes promised by our was of seeing, the mutations we read as well as those that are visited upon our bodies. LaGrace Volcano skillfully demonstrates that sublime mutations are always already the transformations that viewers project on the physical world, and especially on the body.

Swiss Federal Council election, 2008

On 10 December 2008, the Swiss Federal Assembly elected Ueli Maurer as successor to Federal Councillor Samuel Schmid. Schmid resigned on 12 November 2008 after a number of controversies, officially citing health and personal reasons. Maurer took office on 1 January 2009.
Candidates.
The Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC), Switzerland's largest party by voter share but no longer represented in the Federal Council after the 2008 splitoff of Schmid's Conservative Democratic Party (BDP), claimed Schmid's seat. The other governing parties including the BDP accepted the SVP's claim and declined to field candidates of their own. 
On 27 November 2008, the SVP's parliamentary group decided to nominate former Federal Councillor Christoph Blocher and former party president Ueli Maurer as candidates for Schmid's seat. Under new SVP party rules, any SVP member elected to the position without being nominated for it by the group would automatically lose his or her party membership. The opposition Green Party, citing their opposition to the SVP's policies and their representation on the Council, fielded State Councillor Luc Recordon as a candidate of their own.
All governing parties declared Blocher to be unacceptable as Federal Councillor. The center-right Free Democrats (FDP/PRD) decided to support Maurer, while the center-left Social Democrats (SP/PS) announced that they would not elect him and were looking for an alternative SVP candidate. The centrist Christian Democrats (CVP/PDC) announced on 9 December 2008 that a narrow majority of their parliamentary group, 23 MPs, would vote for Maurer
Results.
Prior to the first round, Hansjörg Walter, an SVP councillor from Thurgau who had previously been rumored to be the favorite of the center-left parties, announced that he would not accept an election. He nonetheless received 109 votes. Following the first round, SVP group leader Caspar Baader announced that Christoph Blocher's candidacy was withdrawn in favor of Ueli Maurer. Green Party candidate Luc Recordon, who did not receive more than ten votes in the first round, declared that he would "suspend" his candidacy.
Ueli Maurer was elected Federal Councillor on the third ballot, receiving exactly the 122 votes required.

<doc id="20193195" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20193195" title="UN-SPIDER">
UN-SPIDER

UN-SPIDER ("United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response") is a platform which facilitates the use of space-based technologies for disaster management and emergency response. It is a programme under the auspices of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA).
Space technology and disaster management.
Global vulnerability to natural disasters is likely to increase as the impact of climate change and land degradation processes continues to rise along with rapidly growing populations. Earthquakes, floods, storms, and other natural hazards cause massive disruption to societies and overburden national economic systems. Considerable losses of life and property, however, could be avoided through better information about the risk and onset of disasters, improved risk assessment, early warning, and disaster monitoring. In recognition of these needs the United Nations General Assembly, in its resolution 61/110 of 14 December 2006, acknowledged that use of existing space technology, such as earth observation and meteorological satellites, communication and navigation satellites can play a major role in supporting disaster management by providing accurate and timely information for decision making.
Organization and structure.
In its resolution 61/110 of 14 December 2006, the United Nations General Assembly agreed to establish UN-SPIDER as a new United Nations programme, with the following mission statement: "Ensure that all countries and international and regional organizations have access to and develop the capacity to use all types of space-based information to support the full disaster management cycle". In doing so, UN-SPIDER aims at three goals: being a gateway to space information for disaster management support; serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities; and being a facilitator of capacity-building and institutional strengthening.
UN-SPIDER has three offices in Vienna, Austria, in Bonn, Germany and in Beijing, China.
The UN-SPIDER Vienna office is located at UNOOSA's headquarters in the Vienna International Centre. Its staff members are in charge of general UN-SPIDER coordination, fund-raising, Regional Support Office (RSO) coordination and Technical Advisory Support. The office is supported by the government of Austria.
The UN-SPIDER Bonn Office was established in October 2007 with the support from the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The UN-SPIDER Bonn Office is responsible for UN-SPIDER's knowledge management. The goal is to make sure that all relevant information is easily accessible and disseminated to all stakeholders in the areas of disaster management and emergency and humanitarian response. This is done mainly via UN-SPIDER's Knowledge Portal, which is managed by the Bonn staff. The Bonn Office is also dealing with Technical Advisory Support in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The Beijing office opened on November 9, 2010, and is supported by the government of the People's Republic of China. The Beijing Office is mainly dealing with Technical Advisory Support in the Asia and Pacific region and the coordination of UN-SPIDER's network of National Focal Points.
UN-SPIDER activities.
Knowledge Management.
The acquisition, processing and transfer of knowledge is the central element of UN-SPIDER's activities. A knowledge base on space-based information and solutions to support risk and disaster management are therefore made available through the UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal.
The UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal is central to all knowledge management activities carried out within the framework of UN-SPIDER, as it provides the hosting environment and the dissemination tool for all resulting outputs and products. The Knowledge Portal went online in June 2009 and has been continuously improved and amended ever since. Its main tool is the Space Application Matrix, a sophisticated search engine to make available research papers and case studies on the application of different space-based resources in all phases of the disaster management cycle. The Portal also features the latest news from the disaster and risk management and the space communities, information on workshops, trainings and events as well as profile details on UN-SPIDER's network partners.
UN-SPIDER's knowledge management activities are accompanied by its awareness-raising efforts. Since awareness-raising is a process by which the level of understanding among the persons targeted is raised, fostering change in attitudes and behaviour, it is central to the success of promoting the use of space-based information. In the framework of UN-SPIDER, awareness-raising is designed as an ongoing process accompanying, facilitating and preparing activities, as new audiences are addressed, new partnerships are formed and new technological solutions are developed, offering new opportunities for existing and new target groups. UN-SPIDER implements its awareness-raising activities mainly via its publications such as the monthly Updates and the biannual Newsletter as well as via its Knowledge Portal.
Outreach.
Experience shows that the conduction of activities targeting the full disaster management cycle spans a variety of agencies from the public and the private sector, at different levels, and is best conducted through a coordinated approach. UN-SPIDER's outreach activities contribute to involving practitioners and experts from the disaster management and space communities in UN-SPIDER activities with the end-goal to promote the use of space-based information to support the full disaster management cycle. 
UN-SPIDER's outreach activities include the organization of workshops, seminars and expert meetings in all regions as well as the support to similar events organized by its partners. UN-SPIDER staff furthermore participates in relevant events all over the world to raise awareness about UN-SPIDER's activities and the opportunities that space-based information offers for disaster and risk management.
Technical Advisory Support.
Technical Advisory Support (TAS) is one of the prime activities of the UN-SPIDER programme at the national level. It serves to identify the existing capacity to use space-based information, to analyze the institutional framework to support disaster management through spacebased information and to identify the limitations that inhibit the use of such information. TAS attempts to enable Member States to overcome these limitations through international cooperation and regional opportunities, networking with regional institutions, and setting up disaster management plans. It covers region-specific aspects such as trans-boundary issues, emergency response, risk assessment, 
GIS-based disaster management systems, and disaster-risk reduction. TAS efforts range from a simple consultative phone call to the facilitation of technical support, missions, trainings and workshops. UN-SPIDER's TAS has three pilars: Technical Advisory Missions, Capacity Building and Facilitation of Technical Support.
Technical Advisory Missions (TAMs) are an instrument to identify the needs of Member States regarding their capacities to fully take advantage of space-based information. TAMs are officially requested by the respective national government and are conducted by a team of experts. The team meets with key disaster management and development authorities in the Government, United Nations organizations, regional and international organizations/initiatives and private entrepreneurs to discuss the topic in depth. It makes recommendations focusing on how to improve the access to and use of space-based information in risk and disaster management. Since 2008 various missions have been carried out to countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the Pacific region.
UN-SPIDER defines its Capacity Building as the process of facilitating the strengthening of the competency of individuals, teams, and agencies to use space-based information to prevent, mitigate, and respond effectively to the challenges posed by natural hazards and related humanitarian crises. UN-SPIDER capacity building efforts include 
four complementary types of activities: Providing policy-relevant advice to institutions and governments regarding the use of space-based (spatial) information to support the full disaster management cycle, facilitating access to space-based data and services, facilitating the training of individuals on access to and use of such data and facilitating access to infrastructure, hardware, and software, and services for spacebased applications. Therefore, UN-SPIDER's capacity building simultaneously aims at institutions, individuals and infrastructure.
In the case of emergencies and disasters, UN-SPIDER provides Technical Support by taking the role of a bridge linking the disaster management agencies in charge of response operations with space agencies or the mechanisms which have been established by the space community such as the International Charter: Space and Major Disasters. UN-SPIDER provides this support through the activation of its network of Regional Support Offices (RSO) and through links with specific space agencies.
UN-SPIDER's network.
UN-SPIDER created a global network in order to foster and strengthen strategic alliances and partnerships on a global and regional scale. There are two types of networks: Regional Support Offices (RSOs) and National Focal Points (NFP).
Regional Support Offices.
A Regional Support Office is a regional or national center of expertise that is set up within an existing entity by a Member State. The establishment of a network of Regional Support Offices was agreed upon by the United Nations General Assembly in its Resolution 61/110. UN-SPIDER currently has 12 Regional Support Offices in Algeria, Argentina, Japan, Colombia, Hungary, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Kenya, Romania, Ukraine, West Indies and Panama. Detailed information on all UN-SPIDER Regional Support Offices can be found in the UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal
Regional Support Offices communicate and coordinate with UN-SPIDER staff on regular basis, covering the three following realms:
National Focal Points.
As defined by the United Nations General Assembly, a National Focal Point is a national institution, nominated by the government of the respective country, representing the disaster management and space applications communities. Among them are for example members of the space - or civil protection agencies. UN-SPIDER networks with all countries through the National Focal Points.
A national Focal Point works with UN-SPIDER staff to achieve the following goals:

Sannati

Sannati or Sannathi is a small village, located on the banks of the Bhima River in Chitapur taluk of Gulbarga District of Northern Karnataka. It is famous for the Chandrala Parameshwari Temple and the excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India in the 1986.
Excavations.
In 1986, when the roof of the Kali temple in Chandralamba temple complex collapsed, it destroyed the idol. However it revealed four Ashokan edicts on the floor and foundation stone of the temple. These edicts were written in the Prakrit language and Brahmi script and one of them was used as foundation of the pedestal for Kali idol. During subsequent excavations by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the State Archaeology Department, tablets, sculptures, and other terracotta items were found, and most importantly numerous limestone panels of sculptures of the ruined 'Maha Stupa' or " Adholoka Maha Chaitya" (the Great Stupa of the Netherworld) were found. The excavation work carried out . Archaeologists believe that "Ranamandal" was a fortified area, spread over , out of which only 2 acres has been excavated by 2009. Clay pendants of Roman origin, black polished pottery, Shatavahana and pre-Shatavahana coins, ornaments made of copper, ivory and iron, a township with paved pathways, houses, and limestone flooring have been found. Many excavated items were later shifted to Gulbarga Museum.
Government has asked to Archaeological Survey of India to take up further exploration of the Ranamandal area to know the history of the region and its connection with Buddhism.
One of the stones - the only known example of its type - is of Emperor Asoka (r. 274–232 BC) seated on his throne. It is probably the only surviving image of Emperor Asoka. In 2010, ASI along with Sannati Development Authority deputed Manipal Institute of Technology to prepared blueprint for restoration and reconstruction of the stupas
Mythological references.
Sannati is the place where the Paduka of Goddess Chandrala Parmeshwari - Incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi - was brought. The Goddess came up to the banks of River Bhima at Hongunti - to save her devotee Chandravadani, wife of a rishi, held captive by the local king Setu Raya. Hingulambika temple is situated at Hongunti near Shabad town. The Goddess sent her Paduka from which emerged 5 bumble bees which killed the evil king Setu Raya by drowning him in the Bhima River. Sannati Chandrala Parmeshwari and Hongunti Hingulambika are family deity of many Brahmin and Hindus families of Karnataka, Maharasta, AP etc.
Sannati is also the place where Rishi Markandeya meditated and also composed parts of Markandeya Upanishad. A small temple has been renovated at the place where Markandeya is believed to have sat in meditation. It is said that Rishi Markandeya predates the arrival of Paduka of Chandrala Parmeshwari.
Visitor's attractions.
Other places worth visiting nearby are : Yergol - where Tikacharya eloborated (key book )on works of Madwacharya, Malkhed- Brundavan of Sri Jayatheertharu (Tikachryaru) ; Hongunti; Konchur Hanuman Temple; Ballodgi; Martur - the place where Vignaneshwar edited and condensed Yagnavyalka Smriti, which was named Mitakshara - now known as Hindu Law.

Kingwood Mighty Mustang Military Marching Band

The Kingwood Mighty Mustang Military Marching Band (KM4B), "The Pride of Kingwood", is the 5A varsity marching band for Kingwood High School in Kingwood, TX. KM4B marches in military style, in contrast to drum corps style employed by most high schools. Since the opening of Kingwood High School in 1979, KM4B has received superior ratings for 28 consecutive years at the UIL Regional Marching Contest.
History.
KM4B was founded upon the opening of Kingwood High School in 1979 under the leadership of director Linda Tiner, who helped usher in the style of military marching. From 1986–1994, Ronald Todd served as Director of Bands, and led the band to its first Texas State Marching Contest in 1988 – joining Longview High School(1984) as the only two AAAAA (school-size classification) military-style bands to achieve this in the modern era. Under the direction of Larry Ward, the band went to the 1998 State Marching Contest, where they took first place in marching, and 9th place overall. 
In 2001, KM4B was split into 2 marching bands, the varsity (10–12) band and the freshman (9) band. Larry Ward continued to be the director of the varsity band, and Destry Balch came in and took over the 9th grade band, which was located at the Kingwood 9th Grade Campus, now known as Kingwood Park High School. Then, in 2003, Larry Ward left KHS and took the head band director post at Athens High School, in Athens, TX. It was then that Destry Balch took over the head position of KM4B. Taking over the 9th grade band was John Nielsen, former head director of the Creekwood Middle School band program, and Randy Countryman, a former director at KHS. Beginning in August 2008 upon the formation of Kingwood Park High School, the band expanded to include 9th graders once again. The first four-year class graduated in 2012. It is a tradition for the band to take a biannual trip, which will usually include a major performance. Recent trips include Disney Magic Music Days (2004), 118th Tournament of Roses Parade (2007), Chicago St. Patricks Day Parade (2009), concert in the Lincoln Center in NYC (2011), and the San Diego Veterans Day parade (2012). 
Uniforms.
KM4B's uniforms are of West Point-style, featuring cross-belts, buckles, and flourishes of buttons, chrome, and stripes. The color scheme is based on the three colors of Kingwood High School: navy blue, Columbia blue, and white. The shoes worn by its members are white, providing highly visible contrast between their navy blue pants, and the dark green grass performances are held on. The uniforms have a distinctive patch on each arm, displaying the mascot of Kingwood High School, the Mustang. Every spring, each graduating senior receives one of these patches as a keepsake for their service in the band.
Leadership.
The current band is led through the marching season by its two directors: Destry Balch and Brittany Peters. These directors are responsible for rehearsing the band during school hours, when the band is divided into four concert bands. During these rehearsals, the directors not only work on the music for the field, but also train the students in fundamentals and basic music skills. After school, the marching band rehearses for two hours on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays on the practice field in the parking lot. Student leadership positions include two/three drum majors, "Lode Croo" (Load Crew; spelled differently as a tradition) captain and lieutenants, uniform captain, Drumline captain, section leaders, and the Flag Line.

Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project

The Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project (HHCTCP) is the official name for the plan to construct an elevated rapid transit line serving the City and County of Honolulu on the island of Oahu. Plans for a mass transit line to connect Honolulu's urban center with outlying areas began in the 1960s, but funding was not approved until 2005. The controversy over the rail line was the dominant issue for local politics leading into the 2008 Honolulu elections, and culminated in a city charter amendment which left the final decision to the citizens of Oahu. The amendment passed with 53% of voters in favor. A ground-breaking ceremony to signal the beginning of construction was held on February 22, 2011.
The project, as planned, will construct an elevated rapid transit line from the eastern edge of Kapolei, near the University of Hawaii-West Oahu campus, to Ala Moana Center. The line will pass through communities along southern Oahu, via Honolulu International Airport and downtown Honolulu. The plan also includes extensions west through Kapolei, and a link through Salt Lake. In addition, there will be extensions east to the University of Hawaii-Manoa campus and Waikiki. The line will use trains carrying about 390 passengers each, similar in weight to light rail systems elsewhere in the United States (such as the MAX in Portland, Oregon, as opposed to heavier, and thus more expensive, lines found on rapid transit systems like the subways and elevated systems of Chicago and New York City. Physically, the Honolulu system will have a good deal in common with light rapid transit systems such as SkyTrain in Vancouver, British Columbia or the Copenhagen Metro, as well as the Docklands Light Railway in London.
Previous projects.
For more than 40 years, Honolulu politicians have attempted to construct a rail transit line. As early as 1966, then-mayor, Neal S. Blaisdell, suggested a rail line as a solution to alleviate traffic problems in Honolulu, stating: "Taken in the mass, the automobile is a noxious mechanism whose destiny in workaday urban use is to frustrate man and make dead certain that he approaches his daily occupation unhappy and inefficient." 
Frank Fasi was elected to office in 1968, and started planning studies for a rail project, named Honolulu Area Rapid Transit (HART), in 1977. After Fasi lost the 1980 reelection to Eileen Anderson, President Ronald Reagan cut off funding for upcoming mass transit projects, which led Anderson to cancel HART in 1981. Fasi was reelected in 1984, and restarted the HART project two years later, but the second effort was stopped in a 1992 vote by the Honolulu City Council against the necessary tax increase.
Fasi resigned in 1994 to run for governor, with Jeremy Harris winning the special election to replace him. Harris unsuccessfully pursued a bus rapid transit project as an interim solution until he left office in 2004. His successor, Mufi Hannemann, began the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project (HHCTCP), the island's fourth attempt to build a mass transit system operating in a dedicated right-of-way.
History.
General Excise Tax increase.
Shortly after winning the 2004 election, Hannemann announced that construction of a rail line was an administration priority. The following May, the Hawaii State Legislature passed a bill to allow counties a one-half percent increase in the Hawaii General Excise Tax (GET), from 4% to 4.5%, to fund transportation projects. According to the bill, increased revenue would be delivered to counties implementing the raised tax to fund general public transportation infrastructure throughout Hawaii, and to pay for mass transit in the case of the City and County of Honolulu. Money collected from the initial 4% GET would remain state revenue.
Governor Linda Lingle initially threatened to veto the bill, believing that money destined for county governments should be collected by the individual counties. After compromising with legislative leaders and Mayor Hannemann, however, she allowed the bill to become law. On July 12, 2005, the bill was enacted as Act 247 of the Session Laws of Hawaii 2005, without the Governor's signature. A month later, the Honolulu City Council authorized the one-half percent GET increase, and Hannemann signed the measure into law on August 24. Act 247 required Honolulu to use the funds only for the construction and operation of a mass transit system, and barred its use for public roads and other existing transit systems, such as TheBus. Since no other county authorized the excise tax increase before the deadline of December 31, 2005, the Hawaii GET remains at 4% for Hawaii's three other counties. The increase went into effect on January 1, 2007, and is due to expire on December 31, 2022.
The Legislature considered a bill in the 2009 legislative session that would have redirected income from the half-percent increase back to the state to offset a $1.8 billion projected shortfall in the following three fiscal years. The bill was opposed by Mayor Hannemann and other city leaders who believed that redirecting the money would jeopardize federal funding for the project, and was eventually dropped after U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye indicated to the Legislature that he shared the city's concerns.
Studies.
The City and County of Honolulu Department of Transportation Services released the first formal study related to the HHCTCP on November 1, 2006, the "Alternatives Analysis Report". The report compared the cost and benefits of a "fixed guideway system", along with three alternatives. The first expanded the existing bus system to match population growth. A second option called for a further expansion to the bus system, with improvements to existing roads. The third alternative proposed a two-lane flyover above the H-1 freeway between Pearl City and Honolulu International Airport, continuing over Nimitz Highway, and into downtown Honolulu. The report recommended construction of the fixed guideway, and is considered the city's official justification for building a rail line.
A second planning document, the "Draft Environmental Impact Statement" (DEIS), studied possible natural and social impacts of the construction and operation of the HHCTCP. The DEIS was completed and cleared for public release by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) on October 29, 2008. After minor changes were made to comply with state law, the document was distributed via the city's official project website four days later. The DEIS indicated that impacts of the rail project would include land acquisition from private owners on the route, displacement of residents and businesses, aesthetic concerns related to the elevated guideway, and noise from passing trains.
The city was criticized for timing the release only two days before the 2008 general election. City Councilmember Ann Kobayashi, running as a mayoral candidate against incumbent Hannemann, suggested that the city deliberately withheld key information to early voters who had already cast their ballots for the mayoral candidates, and a city charter amendment related to the project. The anti-rail advocacy group Stop Rail Now criticized the report for not discussing bus rapid transit and toll lanes, options studied earlier by the city in its Alternatives Analysis.
The third and final official planning document, the "Final Environmental Impact Statement" (FEIS), was approved and cleared for public release by the FTA on June 14, 2010. The FEIS addresses and incorporates public comments received regarding the DEIS. The FTA subsequently declared the environmental review process complete in a record of decision issued on January 18, 2011.
Impact on 2008 Honolulu elections.
The importance of the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project in the 2008 mayoral election led one observer to describe the vote as a "referendum on rail transit". Two challengers emerged as rivals to incumbent Mufi Hannemann: City Councilmember Ann Kobayashi and University of Hawaii professor Panos D. Prevedouros. Kobayashi supported a "rubber-tired" mass transit system, as opposed to the conventional steel-wheel-on-steel-rail system chosen by the Hannemann administration. Prevedouros, on the other hand, opposed any mass transit project, favoring construction of a reversible tollway over the H-1, similar to the Managed Lane option studied in the Alternatives Analysis, and reworking existing road systems to ease congestion. No candidate won a majority of votes in the September 20 primary, forcing a runoff between Hannemann and Kobayashi; Hannemann successfully retained his post with 58% of the vote in the November 4 general election.
On April 22, 2008, the Stop Rail Now advocacy group announced their intent to file a petition with the city to place a question on the 2008 ballot to create an ordinance that read: "Honolulu mass transit shall not include trains or rail". Stop Rail Now attempted to submit the petition with 49,041 signatures to City Clerk Denise De Costa on August 5, but was initially denied after De Costa claimed the city charter did not allow the petition to be submitted less than 180 days before a general election, as the wording of the petition called for a special election. Stop Rail Now filed a lawsuit to force the city to accept the petition, and the courts ruled in Stop Rail Now's favor on August 14. Stop Rail Now's petition ultimately failed after De Costa deemed 35,056 of the signatures valid on September 4, well short of the 44,525 required.
In response to the possibility that Stop Rail Now's petition would fail, the City Council voted on August 21 to place a proposed amendment to the city charter on the ballot, asking voters to decide the fate of the project. Mayor Hannemann signed the proposal the following day. The City Council's proposed amendment was not intended to have a direct legal effect on the city's ability to continue the project, but was meant as a means for Oahu residents to express their opinions on its construction. The charter amendment was approved with 53% of votes cast in favor and 47% against. The majority of voters in Leeward and Central Oahu, the areas expected to benefit from the project, generally voted in favor of the amendment, while the majority of those living outside the project's scope in Windward Oahu and East Honolulu voted against it.
Burial issues.
A likely problem that will arise during construction of the rail line in the downtown Honolulu area is that historic human remains will be uncovered. The Oahu Island Burial Council (part of the State Historic Preservation Division, within the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources) refused to participate in signing a programmatic agreement on October 21, 2009, over concerns about likely issues regarding burial sites located along the line's proposed route over Halekauwila Street in Kakaako. Three construction projects in the area since 2002 have each encountered unforeseen human remains that led to delays, and archaeologist Thomas Dye has stated, "The council is absolutely right that you should expect to find burials on Halekauwila Street".
The Burial Council's core contention is the city's decision to conduct an archaeological survey of the rail line's route in phases, meaning construction on a majority of the line will be complete by the time the survey in the Kakaako area is performed, which in turn increases the likelihood that any remains discovered will be moved instead of being allowed to remain "in situ". In response to the Burial Council's concerns, the city agreed to begin conducting an archaeological survey of the area in 2010, two years earlier than originally planned. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources later signed the city's programmatic agreement on January 15, 2011, over the continuing concerns of the Burial Council.
The city's decision to conduct the archaeological survey in phases subsequently led to a lawsuit filed on February 1, 2011 by the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation on behalf of cultural practitioner Paulette Kaleikini. The suit, which names both the city and the State of Hawaii as defendants, contends that state law requires the full length of the rail line to have an archaeological survey conducted before any construction takes place, and seeks to void the environmental impact statement and all construction permits issued for the project. Kaleikini's lawyers filed on February 18 a request for an injunction to stop work on the project until the case is resolved. The suit was initially dismissed on March 23, 2011, after Circuit Court Judge Gary Chang ruled that state and federal laws allow the archaeological surveys to be conducted in phases. Kaleikini's lawyers subsequently appealed to the Hawaii Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the case on May 24, 2012. The court ruled on August 24, 2012 that it agreed with plaintiff Kaleikini that the archaeological survey needed to be completed before construction could take place, and that the State Historic Preservation Division did not comply with state law when it approved the project. The case has now been remanded to Circuit Court. On December 27, 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii granted the plaintiffs injunction, and ordered that all construction related activities in segment 4 of the archaeological survey be halted until compliance with the Hawaii Supreme Court decision made earlier this year is met. This ruling does not affect construction activities in the first three segments, nor does it affect construction planning, design, or engineering in segment 4, which is the final segment to be built. The Phase 4 area encompasses the downtown area and its immediate environs, including Chinatown, Mother Waldron Park, and Beretania Street. Judge Tashima, the only sitting judge on the case, ruled on condition of the injunction that the city is required to file periodic status updates on their compliance with the judgment. The injunction will then terminate 30 days after defendants file a notice of final compliance. City planners and rail representatives stated that archeological surveys will be completed early in 2013, and that this ruling would have no affect on construction in City Center. Both sides are expected to appeal portions of the ruling that they do not agree with.
Delays.
Construction on the HHCTCP rail line was originally scheduled to begin in December 2009, but did not occur owing to delays in the in project review process, including delays in obtaining federal approval of the environmental impact statement.
In January 2010, Governor Lingle publicly recommended that the city alter plans for the rail line after news reports on FTA documents where the federal agency raised issues over declining tax revenues in connection with a global economic recession, and commissioned a study by the state to review the project's finances in March. The state financial study, publicly released on December 2, 2010, indicated that the project would likely experience a $1.7 billion overrun above the $5.3 billion projected cost, and that collections from the General Excise Tax would be 30% below forecasts. Lingle's successor, Neil Abercrombie, publicly stated that the financial analysis would not affect his decision to approve or disapprove of the project, saying that the state's responsibility is limited to the environmental review process, and that decisions regarding the project's finances belong to the city and the FTA. Governor Abercrombie subsequently approved the project's final environmental impact statement on December 16, 2010. The Honolulu City Council held a hearing on January 12, 2011 about the state's financial review, but the hearing was not attended by any state officials, who had been invited to testify.
On January 18, 2011, the FTA issued a "record of decision", indicating that the HHCTCP has met the requirements of its environmental review and that the city is allowed to begin construction work on the project. The record of decision allows the city to begin negotiating with owners of land that will be purchased for the project, to begin relocating utility lines to make way for construction of the line and stations, and to purchase rolling stock for the rail line. A ground-breaking ceremony was held on February 22, 2011 in Kapolei, at the site of the future East Kapolei station along Kualakai Parkway.
Route.
The proposed rail line has twenty-one stations and runs from Kapolei to Ala Moana Shopping Center in Honolulu, where it will split into spurs leading to the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus and Waikiki. The line will fork near Aloha Stadium into two routes, one passing Honolulu International Airport, and the other moving through Salt Lake, before reuniting at Middle Street in Kalihi. The city currently plans to build the section of the line between eastern Kapolei and Ala Moana Shopping Center, excluding the portion passing Salt Lake, with a total of twenty-one stations along the route. The city council initially decided to build the Salt Lake route before the airport route, the result of a compromise with City Councilmember Romy Cachola, whose constituents include Salt Lake residents. After the city charter amendment on rail transit passed, the City Council reconsidered the decision, and decided to re-route the rail line to pass by Pearl Harbor and the airport. The line will be served by long trains, each with a capacity of 390 passengers. The trains will operate with up to twenty departures per hour.
, the line is scheduled to open in two phases in 2017 and 2019:
The rail line, as currently planned, will be built starting from suburban areas in Kapolei and Ewa, and progressing towards the urban center in Honolulu. This is because the first phase includes a baseyard for trains, and a planning decision by the city to delay the major infrastructure impacts associated with construction in the urban center to later phases of the project. Future extensions are planned to eventually service the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, and Waikiki, as well as Kalaeloa.
On October 21, 2009, the city announced Kiewit Pacific Co. had won the $483 million contract to build the first two stages of the line, bidding $90 million under the expected price. The stations will be tendered separately.
Rolling stock for the line will initially include 80 cars in 40 two-car consists, built by a joint venture between AnsaldoBreda and Ansaldo STS named Ansaldo Honolulu. (AnsaldoBreda and Ansaldo STS previously collaborated on the construction and operation of vehicles for the Copenhagen Metro.) Each car will be long, weigh , and have 36 seats with a listed total capacity of 195 people. The cars will be powered by a third-rail electrification system. The two competing bidders for the rail car contract, Bombardier Transportation and Sumitomo Corporation of America, filed protests over the award. Both protests were rejected during the administrative process, but Bombardier sought judicial review of their bid protest. The administrative decision against Bombardier's protest was affirmed by both the state Circuit Court and the Intermediate Court of Appeals.

He was the commander of the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division "Nordland", and awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership by Nazi Germany during World War II, the Oak Leaves being a second award.
Career.
Ziegler was awarded the Spanish Cross for his participation in the Spanish Civil War, fighting in the "Condor" Legion. In 1939 he served as the adjutant in the 3rd Panzer Brigade and on 23 September 1939 he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd class followed by a 1st class award on 28 June 1940.
On 14 March 1943 he was promoted to "Oberst" and served on the General Staff of the XXXXII Army Corps. He was awarded the German Cross in Gold on 15 March 1943 and later was invited by the "Wehrmacht" to a command position in the "Waffen-SS". His SS number was 491,403. From 20 June 1943 Ziegler was the Chief of General Staff of the III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps, and in November 1943 he was granted permission to wear an SS uniform for the duration of his command.
When Fritz von Scholz was killed in action on 28 July 1944, he was asked to take over command of the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division "Nordland". On 5 September 1944 he was awarded the Knights Cross for the conduct of the division in action and the Oakleaves in April 1945.
On 25 April, SS-"Brigadeführer" Gustav Krukenberg was appointed the commander of (Berlin) Defence Sector C which included the "Nordland" Division. Ziegler was relieved of his command of "Nordland" the same day. The exact reason for the transfer of the "Nordland" command is not clearly known. It was requested by General Helmuth Weidling.
After Hitler's death Krukenberg assembled most of his escort made up of French volunteers of the SS "Charlemagne" Division for the breakout of Berlin. They joined up with Ziegler and a larger group of "Nordland" troops. They crossed the Spree just before dawn. Near the Gesundbrunnen U-Bahn station they came under heavy fire. Joachim Ziegler was gravely wounded. Ziegler died from his wounds on the 2 May 1945.

Paddington Academy

Paddington Academy is a non-selective co-educational secondary school and academy located in Maida Vale in the borough of Westminster and the ceremonial county of London, England. Established in September 2006, it is run by the United Learning Trust, a subsidiary of the United Church Schools Trust. The school has a curriculum specialism in Media and Performing Arts and Business and Enterprise. It was officially opened by The Princess Royal on 19 March 2009.
History.
Paddington Academy opened in September 2006 as one of two new academies (along with Westminster Academy) established to replace North Westminster Community School. According to the government, North Wesminster Community School was apparently failing since just 25% of pupils were leaving with 5 A*-C grade GCSEs. The initial plan was for the school to move to an older building located on North Wharf Road for its first term of opening and then move into a brand new building located on Marylands Road. However, work on the new building was severely delayed a number of times which forced the school to stay situated on North Wharf Road for a year before finally being able to move to the new and current site in 2007.
Academics.
In the academy's first Ofsted report in 2007 it was described as "academy [that rightly judges that standards remain low and that achievement is inadequate." The academy's second Ofsted report and first full inspection in 2009 showed that there was an improvement in the grades of students however, there was a lack of consistency within the subjects. However, overall the school was described as " academy which provides a satisfactory quality of education."
In 2007, GCSE results showed that only 25% of students managed to get 5 or more A*–C grades including English and Maths. The following year that figure reached up 41%, a 16% increase. This then fell again to only 34% including English and Maths in 2009, a 7% decrease in the amount of students managing to reach the sufficient grades. However, in 2010 the number of students achieving 5 or more A*–C GCSE grades including English and Maths jumped to 62% and in total, 94% of students managed to achieve 5 or more A*–C grades, up from 86% the year before. As of 2011, the results show that figure has manage to rise again to 68% with a total of 99% of students managing to achieve 5 or more A*–C GCSEs, a 5% increase from last year.
In 2010, Paddington Academy became the second most improved academy in England, was ranked the 5th best school in the country and was ranked 2nd for the most student progress. As of 2011, it received the 3rd highest amount of students receiving 5 or more A*-C GCSEs in Westminster and was ranked the 4th best school in England.
In 2011 Mohammed Said Noor became the first ever student to gain a place at Oxbridge from Paddington Academy. Mohammed received 3A*s and 1A in his A-levels and is currently studying Medicine at the University of Cambridge.

Zoological Museum of Moscow University

The Zoological Museum of Moscow University is the second largest zoological museum in Russia (the largest is the Zoological Museum in St.Petersburg) and one of the twelve largest in the world.
The Museum was established in 1791 as a museum of Natural History. A catalogue of its collections was prepared by Johann Fischer von Waldheim in 1806-1807 following his appointment as Director of the museum. The zoological collections were managed by the Imperial Society of Naturalists of Moscow and separately housed in the 1820s, and a second catalogue was published in 1822. Complete autonomy came in 1861 with the establishment of the Museum of Zoology. In 1866 an exhibition area was opened open for the public. The present building was erected in 1898-1902. 
A Biological Faculty of Moscow University was established in 1930 and the Museum became a part of the University for a year, became independent again and then returned to the University the end of the 1930s. In 1991 it became a research institution. All prehistoric fossils were transferred from the university museum to the newly established Moscow Paleontological Museum in 1987.

Akira Toriyama (ophthalmologist)

Biography and medical career.
Toriyama was born on 20 June 1898 in Shinagawa-machi, Ebara-gun (now Shinagawa-ku), Tokyo. He studied medicine at Tokyo Imperial University, graduating in 1926. His own health was not good, and he is said to have been nudged toward ophthalmology by his own professor, who believed that the relatively stable working hours of an ophthalmologist would be better for Toriyama. In 1928 Toriyama became a professor of ophthalmology at Showa Medical School and he continued at the school as it became Showa Medical University and later Showa University, whose president he became in 1969. Toriyama also became chairman of the university's board of directors; he retired from both positions in 1988 but continued as an adviser. He died on 30 November 1994.
Toriyama was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Second Class, in 1971, and Upper Fourth Rank (), in 1994.
Photography.
In 1934, Toriyama realized that his work as an ophthalmologist gave him some spare time, and his uncle the amateur photographer Yasunari Toriyama introduced him to the Japan Photographic Society (JPS), where the skills of the younger man quickly developed. By 1937 his works were appearing in group shows in Paris and Amsterdam as well as Japan.
Toriyama's membership of JPS was central to his photography, and JPS retained (for example as the title of its magazine) Shinzō Fukuhara's phrase from the 1920s, "Light with its harmony" (, "Hikari to sono kaichō"). Ryūichi Kaneko points out that the work of JPS changed with the times: from a start that rejected certain painterly influences on photography but that embraced the subject-matter and composition of traditional Japanese aesthetics, it moved to include the portrayal of urban scenes and fragments. Kaneko says that, influenced by Rosō Fukuhara, Toriyama went further; for example, in his photography of plants "his emphasis on the sculptural qualities of leaves, stems, and branches is fresh even today"; further, that his style is similar to that of Shōji Ueda, Akira Nomura, and other photographers of the generation who emerged in the late 1930s and are thought of as modernists rather than pictorialists. Kaneko concludes that "work clearly testifies to [his Modernist will to live his own life, to express himself, to the full."
As his medical career progressed, Toriyama's photography continued but went largely unremarked. Following his death, Tomio Yoshikawa (, "Yoshikawa Tomio") of Showa University visited his house and learned that he had left an enormous number of photographs. Yoshikawa soon had a collection of these published. Following this, Toriyama's family and ophthalmologists from Showa University discovered further large numbers of photographs and had selections of these published. First came "Photographs by Akira Toriyama" (1997), a lavish collection of well over a hundred monochrome photographs from the late thirties, reproduced in sepia. This was followed by "A Visit to Showa" (1999), a smaller collection of reproductions of colour slides thought to have been taken between 1962 and 1967. ("Showa" here refers to the Shōwa period, which gave its name to the medical school where Toriyama worked.)

Use and Origin.
GDFS (Global Data Flash Storage) is a proprietary key-value store used by Sony Ericsson on certain of their mobile phones. Its use dates from approximately 2002.
Sony Ericsson handsets using GDFS include those with the DB2010, DB2012, DB2020, DB3150, DB3200, DB3210 and DB3350 hardware sets.
Contents.
Data stored in the GDFS includes hardware customization data (e.g. radio channel parameters, settings for display, audio circuitry etc.), security/identification data (IMEI, lock codes, etc.) and user data - sounds, pictures, SMS, phonebook, calendar and so on. Some of GDFS units ("files"), or sometimes parts of them, are protected by checksums that are stored in other GDFS units.
The GDFS also contains the Security Zone. This contains information about SIM-locks applied to the handset, and IMEI.
Faults and Repair.
Due to the contents of a used handset's GDFS being individual (according to the use and preferences of the user), a damaged GDFS cannot be totally restored to its previous state unless it was backed up before damage occurred. A damaged GDFS is usually reset to factory settings using unofficial software tools such as XS++ or Setool.

Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system

Amtrak's 25 Hz Traction Power System is a traction power grid operated by Amtrak along the southern portion of its Northeast Corridor (NEC): the 225 route miles (362 km) between Washington, D.C. and New York City and the 104 route miles (167 km) between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Railroad constructed it between 1915 and 1938. Amtrak inherited the system from Penn Central, the successor to Pennsylvania Railroad, in 1976 along with the Northeast Corridor. In addition to serving the NEC, the system provides power to New Jersey Transit Rail Operations (NJT), the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and the Maryland Area Regional Commuter Train (MARC). Only about half of the system's electrical capacity is used by Amtrak. The remainder is sold to the commuter railroads who operate their trains along the corridor.
History.
The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) began experimenting with electric traction in 1910, coincident with their completion of the trans-Hudson tunnels and New York Penn Station. These initial systems were low-voltage direct current (DC) third rail systems. While they performed adequately for tunnel service, the PRR ultimately determined them to be inadequate for long distance, high-speed electrification.
Other railroads had by this time experimented with low frequency (less than 60 Hz) alternating current (AC) systems. These low-frequency systems had the AC advantage of higher transmission voltages, reducing resistive losses over long distances, as well as the typically DC advantage of easy motor control as universal motors could be employed with transformer tap changer control gear. Pantograph contact with trolley wire is also more tolerant of high speeds and variations in track geometry. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad had already electrified a portion of its Main Line in 1908 at 11 kV AC 25 Hz and this served as a template for the PRR, which installed its own trial main line electrification between Philadelphia and Paoli, Pennsylvania in 1915. Power was transmitted along the tops of the catenary supports using four single phase, 2 wire 44 kV distribution circuits. Tests on the line using experimental electric locomotives such as the PRR FF1 revealed that the 44 kV distribution lines would be insufficient for heavier loads over longer distances. 
In the 1920s the PRR decided to electrify major portions of its eastern rail network and because any sort of commercial electric grid simply did not yet exist at the time the railroad constructed its own distribution system to transmit power from a select number of generating sites to trains possibly hundreds of miles distant. To accomplish this the PRR chose to implement a pioneering system of single-phase high voltage transmission lines at 132 kV, stepped down to the 11 kV at regularly spaced substations along the right of way. 
The first line to be electrified under this new system was between Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware in the late 1920s. By 1930, catenary extended from Philadelphia to Trenton, New Jersey, by 1933 to New York City, and by 1935 south to Washington, D.C. Finally in 1939 the main line from Paoli west to Harrisburg was completed along with several freight-only lines. Also included were the Trenton cutoff and the Port Road Branch. Superimposed on these electrified lines was an independent power grid delivering 25 Hz current from the point of generation to electric locomotives anywhere on nearly 500 route miles (800 km) of track, all under the control of electric power dispatchers in Harrisburg, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York City.
Northeast railroads atrophied in the years following World War II; the PRR was no exception. The infrastructure of the northeast corridor remained essentially unchanged through the series of mergers and bankruptcies which ended in Amtrak's creation and acquisition of the former PRR lines which came to be known as the Northeast Corridor. The circa 1976 Northeast Corridor Improvement Project had originally planned to convert the PRR's system to the utility grid standard of 60 Hz. Ultimately, this plan was shelved as economically infeasible and the electrical traction infrastructure was left largely unchanged with the exception of a general traction power voltage increase to 12 kV and a corresponding transmission voltage increase to 138 kV.
During the 1970s, several of the original converter or power stations which had originally supplied power to the system were shut down. Also the end of electrified through freight service on the Main Line to Paoli allowed the original 1915 substations and their 44 kV distribution lines to be decommissioned with that 20-mile section of track being fed from 1930s-era substations on either end. In the decade between 1992 and 2002, several static converter stations were commissioned to replace stations that had or were being shut down. Jericho Park, Richmond, and Sunnyside Yard converters were all installed during this period. This replaced much of the electrical frequency conversion equipment, but the lineside transmission and distribution equipment were unchanged.
In 2003, Amtrak commenced a capital improvement plan that involved planned replacement of much of the lineside network including 138/12 kV transformers, circuit breakers, and catenary wire. Statistically, this capital improvement has resulted in significantly fewer delays, although dramatic system shutdowns have still occurred.
Specifications and statistics.
The 25 Hz system was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad with a nominal voltage of 11.0 kV. The nominal operating voltages were raised in 1948 and are now:
As of 1997, the system included:
Over 550 GWh of energy are consumed annually by locomotives on the system. If this was consumed at a constant rate over the entire year (although it is not in practice), the average system load would be approximately 63 MW.
The system power factor varies between 0.75 and around 0.85.
Power sources.
Electrical power originates at seven generation or conversion facilities. The nameplate capacity of all the power sources in the system is about 354 MW. The instantaneous peak loading on the system is between 210–220 MW (as of c. 2009) during the morning rush hour, and up to 225 MW during afternoon. Peak load has risen significantly in the last decade – in 1997 the peak load was 148 MW. As a point of comparison, an HHP-8 electric locomotive is rated for a 6 MW (equivalent to 8,000 hp) mechanical output, after conversion and Head End Power losses.
Regardless of the source, all converter and generator plants supply power to the transmission system at 138 kV, 25 Hz, single phase, using two wires. Typically at least two separate 138 kV circuits follow each right of way to supply the lineside substations.
Currently, the following converter and generating plants are operable, although all are rarely in operation simultaneously due to maintenance shutdowns and overhaul:
Three types of equipment are currently in operation: hydroelectric generators, motor-generators (sometimes called rotary frequency converters), and static frequency converters.
Hydroelectric generators.
The 25 Hz machines at the dam are scheduled by Amtrak but owned and operated by Safe Harbor Water Power Company. Amtrak typically uses this source as a peaking power source, similarly to most hydroelectric plants in the US. Like other hydroelectric plants, it also has excellent black start capability. This was most recently demonstrated during the 2006 blackout. After a cascade shutdown of converters had left the network de-energized, it was recovered using Safe Harbor's generators, and the other converters subsequently brought back online. 
During the twelve-month period ending August 2009, Safe Harbor supplied about 133 GWh of energy to the Amtrak substation at Perryville. Typically, two thirds of the Safe Harbor output is routed through Perryville, the remainder being sent through Harrisburg or Parkesburg. This suggests that Safe Harbor supplies around 200 GWh of energy annually into the 25 Hz network. 
Motor generators (rotary frequency converters).
Motor-generators and steam turbine generators were the original power sources on the PRR traction power network. The last steam turbine shut down in 1954, but some of the original motor generators remain. Although the converting machines are frequently called 'rotary converters' or 'rotary frequency converters', they are not the rotary converter used frequently by subways to convert low-frequency alternating current to DC power. The converters used are more precisely described as motor generators and consist of two synchronous AC machines on a common shaft with different ratios of poles; they are not electrically connected as in a true rotary converter.
Principal advantages of motor generators include very high fault current ratings and clean output current. Solid state electronics can be damaged very quickly, so the microprocessor control systems react very quickly to over-correct conditions to place the converter in a safe, idle mode; or to trip the output circuit breaker. Motor generators are (being of 1930s design) heavily overbuilt. The machines can absorb large load transients and demanding fault conditions and continue to remain online. Their output waveform is also perfectly sinusoidal without noise or higher harmonic output. They can actually absorb harmonic noise produced by solid state devices, effectively serving as a filter. This, combined with their high fault current capability make them desirable in a stabilizing role within the power system. Amtrak has retained two of the original converter plants and plans to overhaul them and continue their operation indefinitely.
Disadvantages of motor generators include lower efficiency, generally between 83% (lightly loaded machine) and 92% (fully loaded machine). A cycloconverter efficiency can exceed 95%. They also require more maintenance due their nature as rotating machines. Their replacement would also be difficult today due to high cost and limited demand for these large 25 Hz machines.
Static frequency converters.
The static converters in the system were commissioned during the decade between 1992 and around 2002. Chief advantages of static converters over motor generators include lower capital cost, lower operating costs, and higher conversion efficiency. The Jericho Park converter exceeds its efficiency design criteria of 95%. Major disadvantages of solid state converters include harmonic frequency generation on both the 25 Hz and 60 Hz sides, and lower overload capability.
Jericho Park was the first solid-state power supply introduced on the Amtrak network. It suffered from some filtering network problems caused by the highly distorted voltage present on the catenary and was ultimately downgraded from its original design capacity of 25 MW to 22 MVA. Amtrak has requested funding to rehabilitate portions of the converter in an ARRA request. During the twelve month period that ended in August 2009, the Jericho Park converter used about 70 GWh of energy. Note that SEPTA's static converter plant at Wayne Junction is also based on this technology, although it was supplied by a different company; see SEPTA's 25 Hz Traction Power System. 
Former converter and power stations.
The majority of power sources in the original Pennsylvania Railroad electrification were built prior to 1940. Some have been retired out-right, others have been replaced with co-located static frequency converters, and others remain in service and will be refurbished and operated indefinitely. The following tables lists sources which are no longer in service.
Declining need for 25 Hz power.
During the beginning of the 20th century, 25 Hz power was much more readily available from commercial electrical utilities. The vast majority of urban subway systems used 25 Hz power to supply their lineside rotary converters used to generate the DC voltage supplied to the trains. Since rotary converters work more efficiently with lower frequency supplies, 25 Hz was a common supply frequency for these machines. Rotary converters have been steadily replaced over the past 70 years with, at first, mercury arc rectifiers and more lately solid-state rectifiers. Thus, the need for special frequency power for urban traction has disappeared, along with the financial motivation for utilities to operate generators at these frequencies.
Long Island City Generating Station.
Long Island City Power Station in Hunter's Point, NY was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1906 in preparation for the North River Tunnels and the opening of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. The station consisted of 64 coal-fired boilers and three steam turbine generators with a total capacity of 16 MW. In 1910, the station was expanded with two additional turbine generators for a total capacity of 32.5 MW. Power was transmitted to rotary converters (AC to DC machines) for use in the PRR's original third rail electrification scheme. Like most DC electric distribution systems of the time (Thomas Edison's being the most famous), 25 Hz power was used to drive rotary converters at substations along the line. Some sources state that the station was largely dormant by the 1920s. When AC overhead electrification was extended in the 1930s, Long Island City connected to the 11 kV catenary distribution system. Operation of the station was transferred to Consolidated Edison in 1938, although ConEd began supplying power from the adjacent Waterside Generating Station, most likely due to declining overall demand for 25 Hz power. The station was disused and sold in the mid-1950s. 
Waterside Generating Station.
Originally constructed by Consolidated Edison to supply power to their DC distribution system in Manhattan, Waterside began supplying power to the PRR's AC system around 1938 when ConEd assumed operation of the Long Island City Station. The single-phase turbine generators were retired in the mid-1970s due to safety concerns. Two transformers were installed to supply catenary power from remaining (three-phase) portions of ConEd's still relatively extensive 25 Hz system. Power flow management problems prevented usage of this source under other than emergency conditions. 
Benning Frequency Changer.
In 1986, Baltimore Gas and Electric elected to not renew the contract under which it had operated the Benning Power Station frequency changer on behalf of Amtrak. They proposed a static frequency changer which was built at Jericho Park (Bowie, Maryland) and placed on service in the spring of 1992. 
Radnor synchronous condenser.
Although reactive power has primarily been supplied along with real power by the steam turbines and motor generators of the system, the PRR briefly used two synchronous condensers. Shortly after commissioning the 1915 electrification, the railroad discovered that the 44 kV feeders and large inductive loads on the system were causing significant voltage sag. The supplying electric utility (Philadelphia Electric) also discovered that power factor correction was needed. In 1917, the PRR installed two 11 kV, 4.5 MVA synchronous converters at Radnor, the approximate center point of the system load. This substation was located at the site of water tanks used to supply water to track pans which supplied water to conventional locomotives. At some later time, the converters were shut down and removed. Dedicated machines for reactive power support have not been used subsequently by either the PRR or Amtrak. 
Substations.
The PRR's original 1915 electrification made use of four substations, at Arsenal Bridge, West Philadelphia, Bryn Mawr, and Paoli. The Arsenal Bridge substation stepped-up 13.2 kV, 25 Hz power supplied from PECO's Schuylkill power station on Christian Street to 44 kV for distribution. The remaining three substations reduced the 44 kV distribution voltage to 11 kV trolley voltage. The substations were operated from adjacent signal towers. They used typical period concrete buildings to house the transformers and switchgear while the line terminals were on the roof. From 1918 onwards outdoor stations were used and when the main line electrification began in 1928 the stations became large open air structures using lattice steel frameworks to mount the 132 kV terminations and switchgear. By 1935 new stations were connected to remote supervision systems allowing power directors to open and close switches and breakers from central offices without having to go through the tower operators.
Today about 55 substations are part of Amtrak's network. Substations are spaced on average 8 miles apart and feed 12 kV catenary circuits in both directions along the line. Thus the catenary is segmented (via section breaks, also called 'sectionalizations' by the PRR) at each substation, and each substation feeds both sides of a catenary's section break. A train traveling between two substations draws power through both transformers.
A typical substation includes two to four 138/12 kV transformers, 138 kV air switches that permit isolation of individual transformers, shutdown one of the two 138 kV feeders, or cross-connection from one feeder to another. The output of the transformers is routed to track catenary via 12 kV circuit breakers and air disconnect switches. Cross-connect switches allow one transformer to feed all catenary lines.
The PRR substation architecture was based on a long distance, high speed railway. The substation spacing ensures that any train is never more than 4 or 5 miles from the nearest substation, which minimized voltage drop. One disadvantage to the substation design as originally built by the PRR concerns its lack of 138 kV circuit breakers. Essentially all segmentation of the 138 kV system must be done by hand. This makes rapid isolation of a fault on the 138 kV line very slow. Faults in one part of the line also affect the entire distribution system since it is impossible for the 138 kV transmission to protect or reconfigure itself during a fault condition. High voltage faults generally are cleared by opening converter output breakers, which causes a concurrent loss of the converter. The system does not degrade gracefully under high voltage faults. Rather than isolating, for example, the south 138 kV feeder between Washington and Perryville, the system would require opening converter output breakers at Jericho Park and Safe Harbor. This results in loss of much more of the network than is required to simply isolate the fault.
Transmission lines.
All transmission lines within the 25 Hz system are two-wire, single-phase, 138 kV. The center tap of each 138 kV/12 kV transformer is connected to ground, thus the two transmission lines are tied to ±69 kV with respect to ground and 138 kV relative to each other.
Generally two separate two-wire circuits travel along the rail line between substations. One circuit is mounted at the top of the catenary poles on one side of the track; the second circuit runs along the other side.
The arrangement of catenary supports and transmission wires gives the overhead structure along former Pennsylvania Railroad lines its characteristic -tall 'H'-shaped structure. They are much taller than the overhead electrification structures on other electrified American railroads due to the 138 kV transmission lines. Catenary towers and transmission lines along former New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad lines and Amtrak's New England division are much shorter, and are recognizable due to different design and construction.
While a majority of the transmission infrastructure is located directly above the rail lines on the same structure that supports the catenary system, some lines are either located above lines that have been de-electrified or abandoned or in a few cases on completely independent rights of way.
The following is a list of all major segments of the 25 Hz 138 kV transmission infrastructure listing substations (SS or Sub) or high-tension switching stations (HT Sw'g) as termini. For clarity, positions of substations are not repeated in this table. A listing of the high-tension switching stations follows.
Recent Developments.
Amtrak's capital improvement program which began in 2003 has continued to the present day and has since 2009, received added support from economic stimulus funding sources (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 or ARRA).
Major improvements in 2010 included:
Major improvements planned for the future include:
Ivy City Substation Project.
The Ivy City substation project marked the first extension of 138 kV transmission line since Safe Harbor Dam was constructed in 1938. In the original PRR electrification scheme, the 138 kV transmission lines went south from Landover to the Capital South substation rather than following the line through Ivy City to the northern approach to Union Station. The two tracks between Landover and Union Station had no high voltage transmission line above them; Union Station catenary was fed at 12 kV from the Landover and Capitol substations (the latter via the First Street Tunnels). When the Capitol South substation was abandoned, coincident with the de-electrification of the track between Landover and Potomac Yard, Union Station and its approaches became a single-end fed section of track. This combined with rising traffic levels resulted in low voltage conditions on the approaches to Union Station and decreased system reliability.
The Ivy City project resulted in the installation of two 4.5 MVA transformers in a 138/12 kV substation on the northeast edge of the Ivy City yard complex and of 138 kV transmission line to augment the overstretched facilities at Landover. Since the original catenary supports along this section of track were only high enough for the 12 kV catenary wire, the 138 kV lines were installed on new steel monopod poles installed along the right-of-way. Except for the fact that the new poles only carry four conductors rather than the typical six for a utility line, the new line appears as a typical medium voltage power line rather than the typical PRR style H-shaped structure.
Conestoga to Atglen transmission line.
In 2011, Amtrak replaced the transmission lines that tie the Conestoga Substation to Parkesburg via Atglen. These lines were originally installed over the Atglen and Susquehanna Branch. The line was subsequently abandoned by Conrail and the tracks removed, but Amtrak has retained an easement to operate its 138 kV transmission lines over the roadbed. Towers and conductors and wire over of the route were replaced; work was completed in September 2011.
Funding for this project was included under the ARRA program. The specified number of poles, spaced approximately per tower, is approximately twice as far apart as the span length between the 1930s structures, which averaged .
Zoo to Paoli Transmission Line.
In late 2010, Amtrak solicited design services for new transmission lines between Paoli and Zoo substations. Primary objectives of this expansion include improving reliability of transmission between Safe Harbor and Philadelphia, and reducing maintenance costs. This project complements the Safe Harbor to Atglen transmission line replacement, which has already been completed.
The Zoo to Paoli transmission line would replace the current supply scheme which uses 138 kV lines which run circuitously along the SEPTA Cynwyd Line, the Schuylkill Branch rail-trails and the Trenton Cut-off between the Zoo and Frazer substations. The new routing will reduce maintenance costs, as Amtrak must maintain transmission poles and control vegetation along right-of-way which it neither owns nor uses for revenue service. The conceptual line will run from the existing Paoli substation to the junction of the Harrisburg to Philadelphia main line and SEPTA's Cynwyd Line at 52nd Street in West Philadelphia. .
The new lines would connect to the existing 1ED and 2ED circuits, which would be abandoned between the junction and their current terminus at the Earnest Junction HT Switch. The plan also includes construction of a 138/12 kV substation at Bryn Mawr to replace the existing switching station. The existing 1915 catenary structures are planned for replacement, and new transmission supports will be compatible with catenary replacement.
Hamilton Substation Project.
A new substation is currently under construction in Mercer County, NJ. This will be called Hamilton, and will be substation 34A. Work on the site began in early 2013, and the substation is due to be commissioned in 2014. 
Morton and Lenni.
All of the 138/12 kV substations described above are owned by Amtrak, with two exceptions: Morton #01 and Lenni #02, owned by SEPTA to supply the Media/Elwyn Line and therefore not covered by Amtrak capital funding programs. SEPTA's own capital improvement plan, formulated in late 2013 after passage of funding legislation in Pennsylvania, calls for renewal of all devices at Morton and Lenni as soon as replacement of Jenkintown and Ambler substations is complete.
Recent problems.
Despite the recent capital improvements throughout the system, several high-profile power failures have occurred along the NEC in recent years.
May 26, 2006 Blackout.
On May 25, 2006, during restoration from maintenance on one of the Richmond inverter modules, a command to restore the module to full output capability was not executed. The system tolerated this reduced capacity for about 36 hours, during which time the problem went unnoticed. During rush hour the next morning (May 26), the overall capacity became overloaded:
By 8:03 am, the entire 25 Hz system, stretching from Washington, D.C. to Queens, New York, was shut down. About 52,000 people were stranded on trains or otherwise affected. Two New Jersey Transit trains stranded under the Hudson River were retrieved by diesel locomotives. Restoration was hampered by policies which allowed the converter stations to operate unattended during rush hour periods. The 25 Hz system was restored by a 'black start' using the Safe Harbor water turbines, and most service along the system returned to normal by mid-afternoon. Amtrak subsequently improved its system of maintaining 'rescue' diesel locomotives near the Hudson River tunnels.
December 23, 2009 Brownout.
Low system voltage around New York City caused a halt of trains in and around the New York area at 8:45 am on Wednesday, December 23, 2009. Power was never lost, and voltage was restored by 11:30 am. Amtrak stated that an electrical problem in North Bergen, New Jersey (near the western portal and the Union City substation) caused the problem, but did not further elaborate on the nature of the malfunction.
August 24, 2010 Brownout.
Low system voltages beginning at 7:45 am on Tuesday, August 24, 2010, caused Amtrak to order an essentially system-wide stoppage of trains within the 25 Hz traction network. Slow-speed service was gradually restored, and the power problem was corrected by 9:00 am, although delays persisted the remainder of the morning.
October–November 2012: Hurricane Sandy.
On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck the northeast coast of the U.S. Augmented by a nor'easter, the storm surge from Sandy raced through the Hackensack Meadows, severely damaging (among other railroad infrastructure) Kearney Substation #41 and knocking it offline. This loss of electrical capacity forced Amtrak and New Jersey Transit to operate fewer trains, using modified weekend schedules. With assistance from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the substation was isolated from floodwaters and then dewatered. After testing the substation's components, the degree of damage was determined to be less than initially feared, and after further repairs, Kearney Substation came back on-line on Friday, November 16, allowing the immediate return of all Amtrak and gradual return of all NJ Transit electric trains into Penn Station through the dewatered North River Tunnels.
Amtrak has since requested federal funding to upgrade Kearny substation so it is high enough to not be affected by flood water

Marlis Petersen

Marlis Petersen (born 1968) is a German coloratura soprano, particularly known for her performances in the title role of Alban Berg's opera "Lulu", and as Konstanze in "The Abduction from the Seraglio" and Zerbinetta in "Ariadne auf Naxos".
Born in Tuttlingen, Marlis Petersen won six important piano competitions before eventually going to the Stuttgart Conservatory where she studied music education, flute and dance as well as voice. She made her operatic debut at the Staatstheater in Nuremberg as Ännchen in "Der Freischütz" which led to a contract with the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, where she primarily sang in operas by Mozart and Strauss. On 6 September 2007, she sang the role of Aphrodite in the world premiere of Hans Werner Henze's "Phaedra" at the Berlin State Opera. Another world premiere came in May 2008, when she sang the role of Marta in Manfred Trojahn's "La Grande Magia" at the Dresden Semperoper. She has also appeared on the stages of Vienna, Salzburg, Munich, London, and Paris, Geneva, and Monte Carlo. In addition to her operatic roles, she is known for her performances in works by Johann Sebastian Bach with conductors Ton Koopman and Helmuth Rilling and for her "Lieder" recitals with pianist Jendrik Springer. She sang the title rôle in the premiere of the opera "Medea" by Aribert Reimann at the Vienna State Opera in 2010.
She made an exceptionally strong impression in her unexpected assumption of the role of Ophélie in Ambroise Thomas's "Hamlet" at the New York Metropolitan Opera in March 2010. She spent less than four days preparing for the role, for which a reviewer remarked, "that, to judge from her beautiful and emotionally vulnerable singing, she clearly relishes."

Gordy family

The Gordys are an African-American family of businesspeople and music industry executives. They were born to Georgia-reared parents Berry "Pops" Gordy, Sr. and Bertha Fuller Gordy and raised in Detroit, where most of the siblings played a pivotal role in the international acceptance of rhythm and blues music as a crossover phenomenon in the 1960s. The accomplishment is attributable to the creation of Motown, a company founded by the seventh-oldest sibling, Berry Gordy, Jr..
Businesspeople, musicians, recording artists and executives within the family.
Berry and Bertha Gordy.
As a couple, Berry and Bertha owned several businesses, including a successful painting business that they established, and a construction firm. Berry, Sr. (or Berry II) established a Booker T. Washington grocery store in Detroit, while Bertha co-founded the Friendship Mutual Life Insurance Company. Later, Berry Sr. mentored several recording acts for his son's Motown label. 
Bertha died in 1975. Berry II died in 1978. A tribute album, called "Pops, We Love You!", and single, called "Pops, We Love You (A Tribute to Father)", were released later that year in his memory.
Fuller Berry Gordy.
The eldest Gordy child, Fuller B. Gordy (September 9, 1918 – November 9, 1991), born in Georgia, was an executive alongside his younger siblings in their brother Berry's Motown music company. Fuller was also a professional in bowling. His daughter Iris was married to singer Johnny Bristol.
Esther Gordy Edwards.
The eldest Gordy daughter, Esther (April 25, 1920 – August 24, 2011), born in Georgia, established herself early in business as a political campaigner for her husband, Detroit politician George Edwards. In the late 1950s, she formed a loan company named after her parents; in 1959, she helped her brother Berry with a $800 loan to start Tamla Records. She borrowed the proceeds from the college tuition fund their father had established for Berry. Edwards served as mentor, adviser, and vice president of Motown's main offices from 1961 until 1972, when Berry moved the entire operation to Los Angeles. In 1985, she founded the Motown Historical Museum at the site of the former Hitsville U.S.A. studios, where many of Motown's successful recording artists recorded. Esther died in 2011 at the age of 91.
Anna Gordy Gaye.
Though she is often remembered more for her volatile marriage to Motown legend Marvin Gaye, Anna Ruby Gordy (January 28, 1922 – January 31, 2014), the third and last child born in Georgia prior to the family's move to Detroit, was one of Motown's earliest songwriters, penning several hits mainly for her first (and only) husband. Anna also co-founded a self-named music label (Anna Records) that would establish Motown's records nationally, such as Barrett Strong's "Money (That's What I Want)". In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Anna co-wrote The Originals' biggest hits, "Baby I'm For Real" and "The Bells", alongside Marvin. She also co-wrote "God Is Love" and "Flying High (In the Friendly Sky)" on Marvin's famed "What's Going On" album. Despite an acrimonious divorce in 1977, Gordy remained friends with Gaye until his 1984 death, after which Anna retreated into seclusion, only coming out briefly to celebrate Marvin's music career by attending ceremonies, including Marvin's 1987 induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Anna died in 2014 at the age of 92.
Loucye Gordy Wakefield.
Another astute businesswoman, Loucye (1924 – July 24, 1965) was named head of Jobete Music, Motown's main publishing division created by Berry. Loucye headed the division until her sudden death from brain cancer in 1965. Her youngest brother Robert succeeded her as the publishing company's head. At the time of her death on July 24, 1965, she went by the name Loucye S. Gordy Wakefield.
George Gordy.
George Weldon Gordy, Sr. (January 7, 1926 – July 27, 2011) started several short businesses before joining his brother's Motown label in 1960, where he was a co-writer of several songs released by Motown artists. By his wife Rosemary (who died in 1980), he has six sons and two daughters.
Gwen Gordy Fuqua.
Another important member of Motown's growing success was Gwendolyn Gordy (November 26, 1927 – November 8, 1999). Gwen partnered with her brother Berry and then-boyfriend Billy Davis to co-pen several hits for Jackie Wilson in the mid-1950s. In 1959, Gwen, Billy and sister Anna formed Anna Records in Detroit. Anna would be the site where the hit song, "Money (That's What I Want)", then a regional single for Berry's Tamla Records, would get its first national distribution. Two years later, Anna Records was absorbed by Motown. In 1961, Gwen married The Moonglows' Harvey Fuqua and the two presided over the labels Harvey Records and Tri-Phi Records; the latter label represented acts such as The Spinners. By 1964, Gwen joined Motown's staff songwriting team, later writing "Distant Lover" for her brother-in-law, Marvin Gaye, and discovering the disco group High Inergy in 1976. Gwen died of cancer in 1999 at the age of 72.
Berry Gordy.
A former boxer and jazz record store owner, Berry Gordy, Jr. (November 28, 1929 – ), first got involved with producing and writing R&B songs in 1955. Amongst Gordy's earliest songwriting successes were songs he penned as one-third of the songwriting team behind Jackie Wilson's first legion of solo hits, including "Reet Petite", "To Be Loved" and "Lonely Teardrops". By 1959, Gordy, fed up with not being paid royalties for his work with Wilson and other acts, decided to form a record label. He convinced his sister Esther to loan him $800 from the tuition fund his father had established for him and formed Tamla Records in January of that year. The label didn't become national until later that year after the success of Barrett Strong's "Money (That's What I Want)", and the label changed its name to Motown Records in December. Its first national release was The Miracles' "Way Over There". After 1964, Motown became one of the most successful recording labels in the business and "The Motown Sound", partially cultivated by Gordy, began to dominate popular music and pop culture. Gordy soon developed Motown Industries in 1968, which developed television specials and variety shows. By 1973, Motown had produced more than 100 top ten and number-one singles on various "Billboard" charts and had become the most successful black business company ever. By founding Motown Records, Gordy became the first African-American owner of a major recording label. He retired from being president of Motown Records in 1973 and from Motown Industries in 1988; he sold Motown's interest for $61 million to MCA Records and Boston Ventures. Gordy was inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for his musical achievements the same year he sold Motown.
Robert Gordy.
Robert Louis Gordy (1931 – ) is best known for playing a cameo in the Diana Ross-starring vehicle "Lady Sings the Blues", playing a drug dealer named "Hawk". Also an early songwriter of several songs for the Motown label, Gordy recorded a 1958 novelty hit, titled "Everyone Was There", under the stage name Bob Kayli. He replaced Loucye Gordy as head of Jobete Music Publishing in 1965 after Loucye's death. Gordy is the father of Robert Louis Gordy, Jr.
Music groups formed consisting of family members.
Apollo.
A quintet formed by Kerry Gordy and his friends. Also in this group was Kerry's half-brother Cliff Liles, a son by Raynoma Mayberry Liles and Charles Liles.
LMFAO.
A duo consisting of Skyler Austen ("SkyBlu") Gordy (born August 23, 1986), grandson of Berry Gordy, Jr. and Thelma Coleman through their son Berry Gordy IV and his wife Valerie Robeson, and also Stefan Kendal ("Redfoo") Gordy (born September 3, 1975), son of Berry Gordy, Jr. and Nancy Leiviska.
Other family members.
Iris Gordy.
Iris Gordy (1943 - ) served as a vice president at Motown, where she helped launch the careers of DeBarge, Teena Marie, and Rick James. She currently sits on the board of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. Iris is the daughter of Fuller Gordy.
Kerry Gordy.
Son of Berry Gordy, Jr. and his second wife, Raynoma Mayberry, was a member of the band Apollo, which released an album on Gordy Records in 1979. Later, he worked as a staff writer and producer at Motown under his given name, Kerry Ashby. He continues to work as an entertainment industry executive today.
Rockwell.
Son of Berry Gordy, Jr. and former girlfriend Margaret Norton, Kennedy William Gordy changed his name to Rockwell in 1983 to become a rock star. The singer, who earned his deal with Motown without his father's knowledge, recorded his biggest hit, 1984's "Somebody's Watching Me", which included background vocals by Michael Jackson. The song rose to number-two on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Rockwell turned out to be a one-hit wonder and after two more albums, he retired from music in the late 1980s.
Rhonda Ross Kendrick.
Daughter of Berry Gordy, Jr. and Diana Ross, Rhonda garnered fame as an actress, first in the daytime soap "Another World" for which she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy and later in films like "The Temptations", where she played Temptations original member Paul Williams' wife. She later embarked on a jazz career, which continues today.
Redfoo.
Son of Berry Gordy, Jr. and Nancy Leiviska, Stefan Kendal Gordy is better known by his stage name Redfoo. Alongside his nephew Skyler Gordy, who himself is known as SkyBlu, he is a singer, rapper and dancer best known as part of the musical duo LMFAO. The two of them created their act in 2006 and have since released two studio albums.
Denise Gordy.
Daughter of George and Rosemary Gordy, sister of George Jr and Patrice Gordy (among others), mother of Marvin Gaye III and Bianca Lawson, and grandmother of Marvin IV and Dylan Gaye. Denise appeared in television and theatrical productions throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
Bianca Lawson.
Daughter of Denise Gordy and Richard Lawson, Bianca, like her parents, achieved fame as an aspiring actress appearing in numerous television productions and theatrical releases. Appeared alongside Rhonda Ross Kendrick in the television miniseries "The Temptations" as Diana Ross.

John Bunting (diplomat)

Sir (Edward) John Bunting (3 March 19182 May 1995) was an Australian public servant and diplomat, whose senior career appointments included Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
Biography.
Bunting was born in Ballarat, Victoria, and was educated at the Trinity Grammar School and later at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1938 with a Bachelor of Arts (honours). Bunting was one of four graduates accepted into the Commonwealth Public Service in 1940, accepting a posting in Canberra within the Department of Trade and Customs and later, the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. After a short posting overseas, Bunting became a member of the Sydney-based Inter-Departmental Dollar Committee, which dealt with the allocation of dollars for imports.
In 1950 he was appointed to the Prime Minister's Department as an assistant secretary and later returned to London as Official Secretary at Australia House. Back in Canberra, Bunting was appointed deputy secretary in the Prime Minister's Department and appointed as Secretary to that department in 1959, a position he continued to hold until 1968, and served successive Prime Ministers Sir Robert Menzies, Harold Holt, and John McEwen. Within days of John Gorton becoming Prime Minister, Bunting was sidelined as Secretary to the newly formed Department of the Cabinet Office and was replaced by Lenox Hewitt as Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department. On taking office as Prime Minister in 1971, William McMahon reversed Gorton's changes and restored Bunting to the pre-eminent position as Secretary to the newly formed Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Hewitt accepted appointment to the lesser role of Secretary to the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Bunting provided advice to incoming Prime Minister Gough Whitlam on the transition to government; with Whitlam later opining of Bunting:
(His) loyalty, integrity, diligence and dedication have made him a leader and example among all public servants.
Bunting was appointed to serve as High Commissioner in London, with effect from 1 February 1975. Suffering a heart attack whilst in Dundee in February 1968, Bunting returned to Australia in 1977, unable to complete his full term as High Commissioner. 
Upon his return to Australia, Bunting was appointed as a consultant to the Office of National Assessments. A close confidant of Robert Menzies during and after his Prime Ministerial career, in 1978 Bunting was appointed as the inaugural National Coordinator of the Sir Robert Menzies Memorial Foundation. In 1988, Bunting authored a biography of Robert Menzies, entitled "R. G. Menzies: a portrait".
Bunting died in Sydney on 2 May 1995, aged 77, survived by Lady Bunting and their three sons.
Honours.
In 1953 Bunting was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire; and upgraded to a Commander of the Order in 1961. Knighted as a Knight Bachelor in 1964; and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1977. In 1982 Bunting was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in recognition for public and community service.

East Ramapo Central School District

East Ramapo Central School District is a school district headquartered in the Senator Eugene Levy Dr. Jack R. Anderson Education Center in the Town of Ramapo, New York, United States. The district serves areas of eastern Town of Ramapo, including Chestnut Ridge, New Hempstead, New Square, Spring Valley, and a portion of Airmont. The district also serves the hamlets of Hillcrest and Monsey, as well as the Village of Pomona which straddles the borders of Town of Ramapo and Town of Haverstraw.
History.
In 1997, of the 18,000 children transported by the district, 10,500 were students of yeshiva private schools. Joseph Berger of "The New York Times" said in an article written during that year that this involved "a proportion of public school money to bus private school students that few American towns can match." 
During that year 9,500 of the children within the district were private school students from the Village of New Square, Village of Kaser, and the community of Monsey. A 1997 "The New York Times" article stated that some East Ramapo school district parents said that the high proportion of private school parents to public school parents could threaten the district. Harvey Katz, an Orthodox Jew who served as a school board member, said that "Just because my children are not in the public schools doesn't mean I don't care about all the children. Children are our future, wherever they may be." 
During that year the district was one of five districts in New York State where more students were enrolled in private school than in public school due to religious reasons.
In a 2007 magazine article Dr. Mitchell Schwartz, the superintendent of the district, said that growing Hasidic yeshivas resulted in private school enrollment within the district increasing by a 3 to 4 percent increment per year.
During the year 2011 an article titled Regions Aging Schools Crumble as Finances Falter by Cathey O'Donnell and Gary Stern, was featured in a local newspaper, The Journal News, which is well known throughout the Lower Hudson Valley of Westchester County, New York. The article was about several old school buildings within the region that were in a current state of disrepair, how much it would cost to fix them and which if any might need to be demolished. One of the school districts mentioned was East Ramapo.
In March 2013, the news website Ynetnews reported, that there is much tension in that school district, because the local school board is accused of favoring private schools at the expense of public schools. 
The New York State Education Department ("SED") has directed District to post the following [http://www.eram.k12.ny.us/education/page/download.php?fileinfo=TllTRURfTGV0dGVyX19vZl9Ob25jb21wbGlhbmNlX2J5X0RlTG9yZW56by5wZGY6Ojovd3d3L3NjaG9vbHMvc2MvcmVtb3RlL2ltYWdlcy9hdHRhY2gvMzQzMDMvODYwOV8zNDMwM19hdHRhY2hfMTk2NC5wZGY= letter of non-compliance, sent to the District by SED on December 19, 2012.
Schools.
All of the schools are in the Town of Ramapo. Some schools are also located within other municipalities.

Nicholas Grabowsky

Nicholas Grabowsky (born May 7, 1966) is a horror/fantasy author and screenwriter.
Biography.
Personal Life
Nicholas Grabowsky was born Nicholas John Grabowsky in Norwalk, California on May 7, 1966, to parents Arthur J. Grabowsky and Doris Ruth Moreno. From 1966 to 1995, he resided with his family in Southern California, where Anaheim, California is heralded as his hometown although he also resided periodically in surrounding towns such as Garden Grove, California. He began writing fiction as early as the third grade at the Thomas Alva Edison Elementary School in Anaheim, where his teacher assigned students to pen their own tall tales after viewing Disney film shorts such as "Paul Bunyan" in 1958 and Pecos Bill. As early as the sixth grade, while attending Dr. Jonas E. Salk Elementary School, he had written dozens of short scripts and novellas and had drawn a series of comics entitled "Gooneyville", which he regularly photocopied and distributed to classmates, as well as audiotaped variety segments entitled "The Swiss Robber Show", where he'd utilize scripted recorded voices from locals combined with sound effects and celebrity voices and music from radio and television which he sold for a dollar apiece to faculty, students and neighbors. 
His creative writing continued through junior high and high school, where he consistently sought the attentions of Hollywood with screenwriting and acting pursuits and involved his writing in various periodicals such as Jack N' Jill Magazine, until a strict conservative Christian Penticostal upbringing and involvement with a number of related denominations and Christian cults found his interests redirected in his late teens towards evangelism, related contemporary Christian music, and songwriting . By the time he was eighteen years of age, he was preaching and often singing largely original songs and playing piano to congregations of over a thousand people with a mannerism and style similar to Keith Green, infused with further influences notably from Steve Taylor and Randy Stonehill. 
In 1993, Nicholas' parents purchased a house in Sacramento, California, for retirement, and moved to their new home with Nicholas' autistic sister Carol Jean Grabowsky. In June 1995, Carol went missing from her adult education services school, and Nicholas devoted his time to search for her, along with local news media, a host of volunteer searchers, and the assistance of such celebrity personalities as Charlotte Blasier, wife of O. J. Simpson defense attorney Bob Blasier. Carol's body was found by two boys in a drainage ditch near Discovery Park, Sacramento, in October 1995, which remains to this day a closed case with the details leading to her death entirely unsolved. 
Of note is the fact that Nicholas is the grandson of Alfred Moreno, a 1940s general manager of Los Angeles' Biltmore Hotel, whose brother, Antonio Moreno, was the great Hollywood silent film actor/director who starred in hundreds of films throughout the early twentieth century and, most notably, in Universal's "Creature From the Black Lagoon". 
Writing career.
After acquiring jobs as an extra in Hollywood for such films as Masters of the Universe and Night of the Creeps , and pursuing a modeling career, his pursuits found him an acting coach in the form of Walter Koenig, Chekov , who introduced Nicholas to a New York publisher of mass market paperback novels. His first novel, "Pray Serpent's Prey", originally a Christian allegory of vampires invading a small Montana town involving a preacher who learns that the power of God alone could save the central characters, and which Grabowsky began penning in high school, was accepted and published by Critic's Choice Paperbacks/Lorevan Publishing (the same publisher as Koenig) under the pseudonym of Nicholas Randers. Grabowsky penned subsequent published works under the Randers name including "The Rag Man' and "Tale of the Makeshift Faire" before 1990, and romance novels and self-help books under the pen name of Marsena Shane which include "Sweet Dreams Lady Moon", "The Easy Way to Great Legs", "Your Heart Belongs to You" and "June Park" up until 1991, when he broke away from his pseudonyms entirely. He also wrote a commissioned sequel to Wes Craven's Shocker, which was never produced. In 1988, he wrote the novelization of "" which was published under his real name, which went on to be a bestseller. 
Grabowsky is "A well-established author of horror/fantasy fiction". In 2001, he completed his signature novel "The Everborn", which won the award for Science Fiction Novel of the Year (2004) from the American Author's Association. In 2002, he established the small press of Diverse Media, which published a critically acclaimed special limited edition of his novel. Following this he released works such as "Diverse Tales", "The Wicked Haze", the children's book "Flatty Kat: Tales of an Urban Feline" with Phyllis Haupert, and "Nick Reads & Reviews", and Grabowsky subsequently cemented himself as a prominent name in horror/fantasy literature with those and a list of other novels and short stories, poetry and scripts. In 2008, he established the small traditional publishing house of Black Bed Sheet Books, which publishes fiction from many authors largely in the horror/fantasy category, and Black Bed Sheet Productions, which produces independent genre feature film. In 2008, he co-wrote the screenplay for "Into the Basement" with Norm Applegate, based on Applegate's book, for Triad Pictures, scheduled for release in 2009.
Nicholas Grabowsky's work can now be seen in comic form. In 2010 Shot In the Dark Comics, an independent comic book company, acquired the rights from Grabowsky and has released a set of comics taken from his popular book "Red Wet Dirt." http://shotinthedarkcomics.com/1.html 
Looks like "A Rat To Me," has already been released in August 2010. The follow-up graphic novel "The Father Keeper" will be released in 2011. 
Quotes about Grabowsky.
"My Dear Nicholas: You seem to me---in a way that's entirely admirable----a man out of time. You're writing horror epics when the audience has become increasingly numbed by cinematic hokum and stale ideas. I salute you: your ambition, your dedication, your achievements, your blissfully complex imagination..." -Clive Barker 
"Grabowsky succeeds in making the whole world creepy..." -Heidi Martinuzzi, E! Entertainment Television 
"Grabowsky's writing is at times touching and emotional, however, his real talent is his ability to infuse his writing with a sense of dread and loathing that I have not experienced since H.P. Lovecraft..." -Tahoe Daily Tribune 
"Grabowsky has imagination to spare...!" -Sacramento Bee 
"Impressive storytelling..." -Wes Craven

Cap de la Chèvre

The cap de la Chèvre is the southernmost point of the Crozon peninsula in western Brittany in France. Facing south, it faces the north side of cap Sizun and closes off the baie de Douarnenez.
Consisting of heath, heather and maritime pines, this headland maintains a savage appearance and magnificent countryside, along with several little villages with stone-built houses typical of the region. At the end of the headland, in good weather, one can see cap Sizun, île de sein, the baie de Douarnenez, pointe de Pen-Hir, pointe Saint-Mathieu and the islands of Ushant and Molène.
Sheep will soon be reintroduced into the cap de la Chèvre, to maintain the moors of the Conservatoire du littoral.

Heavy Shreddin'

Heavy Shreddin is a video game about snowboarding that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990. It was released in Europe with the title Snowboard Challenge.
Gameplay.
There are three mountains that the player must overcome in order to complete the game. As the player descends the mountain the terrain becomes more and more difficult to navigate. There are three degrees of difficulty on each of the mountains. The first is novice (marked by a circle), the second is intermediate (marked by a square), and the third is expert (marked by a diamond).
The player starts out with four lives. There are five different events and a total of 18 levels of play. In order to progress to the next event, you must first successfully complete the event you are currently playing. If the player falls or runs out of time a life is taken away. After completing a trail the player is rewarded with a bonus life. If the player is able to complete all of the trails and events they will have completed the game.
Scoring Points.
There are several ways in which the player is able to score points in the game. Some of the ways are:
The player performs tricks by jumping and then pressing in any direction on the directional pad.

Japanese seaplane carrier Mizuho

Construction.
"Mizuho" was built to a similar design as the seaplane carrier "Chitose", but with slightly less powerful diesel engines instead of "Chitose"s turbines. She carried 24 seaplanes, and was equipped to carry twelve miniature submarines, although she could not carry full loads of both at one time.
Combat.
"Mizuho" participated in invasion support for much of her career; her first mission was with the Fourth Surprise Attack Force. On 1 March 1942, planes from "Mizuho" and "Chitose" damaged the American destroyer , which was later sunk by aircraft from the aircraft carrier "Ryujo" and gunfire from the heavy cruisers "Ashigara" and "Myoko".
Sinking.
The American submarine torpedoed "Mizuho" at 23:03 hours on 1 May 1942 40 nautical miles (74 km) off Omaezaki, Japan. She capsized and sank at 04:16 hours on 2 May 1942 with the loss of 101 lives. There were 472 survivors, of which 31 were wounded.

Design basis accident

A design basis accident (DBA) or "maximum credible accident (MCA)" is a postulated accident that a nuclear facility must be designed and built to withstand without loss to the systems, structures, and components necessary to assure public health and safety.
Subtypes of DBAs are:
Circumstances like the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami were considered unlikely or impossible, and so the resulting Fukushima I nuclear accidents were described using this terminology as "beyond design basis accidents" or "non-design-basis accidents".
Accidents caused by poor design, failure to follow listed safety procedures or other forms of human error are not considered to be beyond design basis accidents. The terminology can be unclear, however, because a poorly handled design basis accident can result in conditions beyond what was considered likely, causing a beyond design basis accident. For this reason, some industry experts have criticized the use of design basis terminology. The Three Mile Island accident and the Chernobyl disaster are examples of design basis accidents becoming non design basis accidents largely due to failures to follow the written operating procedures. 
Beyond design basis events.
The Fukushima I nuclear accident was caused by a "beyond design basis event," the tsunami and associated earthquakes were more powerful than the plant was designed to accommodate, and the accident is directly due to the tsunami overflowing the too-low seawall. Since then, the possibility of unforeseen beyond design basis events has been a major concern for plant operators.

Pointe Saint-Mathieu

The pointe Saint-Mathieu (Lok Mazé in Breton) is a headland located near Le Conquet in the territory of the commune of Plougonvelin in France, flanked by 20m high cliffs.
Village.
At present, there are only a few houses on the point, grouped around the abbey ruins. However, in the past the settlement was not limited to the abbey and its dependents. Very soon a village was established along the coast for commercial potential and the possibilities for salvaging wrecks.
Abbey.
The abbey held many privileges - right to rushes, right to furnaces, rights to a twelfth of jet, right to markets, right to fairs (Henry IV of France had instituted, in 1602, 5 annual fairs and a weekly market), right to measure wheat and wine, etc...
In 1157 Hervé de Léon accorded the abbey the right of flotsam and jetsam on wrecks in all his fiefdoms; in 1390 the abbey received the right to take 10% of the hull, cargo and rigging of wrecked ships. To this right were added the right of remains, confirmed in 1602 by royal letters patent. He accorded this right to the monks for "all those who perish in the sea, and on the coasts at Saint Mathieu, Plougonvelin and le Conquet".
Today abandoned, the Abbaye Saint-Mathieu de Fine-Terre, was said to have held the skull of the apostle Matthew, now lost in the ocean off the point. Its ruins served as a set for the summer TV saga "Dolmen".
Lighthouse.
The point also has a 56m high lighthouse, built in 1835.
Signal station.
The first signal station near the point was built in 1806, but the present one was built nearer the point in 1906, to give a view of the chenal du Four as the entrance to Brest. Progressively expanded in the 20th century, its top is now 39m above sea level, with lodging for spotters.
The cenotaph (Memorial to sailors who have died for France).
Commissioned by Émile Guépratte and Georges Leygues after the First World War, it was built following the law of 26 July 1923. The stela (representing a sailor's wife) was designed by René Quillivic and inaugurated on 12 June 1927.
Since 2005, it has been open to the public and accompanied by a permanent exhibition of photos of disappeared sailors.

Mechanical powder press

Function-Principles of mechanical presses in the field of Technical Ceramics.
The function principles of the mechanic press machines differ in how to ensure the upper punch–main movement by cams, spindles-and friction drives, eccentric, knuckle-joints or by the round table principle, independent if the die-or lower punch movement is realized by cams- or eccentric systems or other mechanically or hydraulically combined systems.
The executions of auxiliary movements are also not decisive for a term-classification.
These auxiliary movements can also base on pneumatic and hydraulic principles.
In comparison to hydraulic press machines the maximum compaction forces of mechanical powder presses are limited and are placed in the range </= 5000 kN.
For the requirements of wet-and dry pressing techniques in the field of Technical Ceramics cams-, eccentric-, knuckle joint- as well as round table presses have proved and tested, whereas cam-presses especially used for wet-press-techniques of pourable materials.
The range of compaction force of mechanical presses for products of the Technical Ceramics is
< 2500 kN, what is caused from the less density of the ceramic materials.
Normally the upper punch-, lower punch- and die systems of mechanical presses don’t work on base of multi-subdivided punches.
Application-Advantages in the field of Technical Ceramics.
Adaptable cam-executions, which can be made suitable individually to the concerned products, will meet especially the requirements of wet-press-technique of pourable compounds, while applications of eccentric-, knuckle-joint and round table presses are particularly related on the dry-press-technique of compounds with gliding characteristics.
The sinusoidal movement of eccentric presses offers advantages especially for bigger strokes < 100 strokes per minute and the distorted sinusoidal movement of the knuckle joint is especially used for products, which need a longer time for deairing in the phase of compaction and a longer time for decompression after the bottom dead centre.
For this kind of compaction technology the strokes are limited < 35 strokes per minute, but in contrast to that the compaction speed of round table presses for small and simple shaped products are especially high and quantities < 30,000 pcs per minute can be realized.
Context between ceramic compaction technology and design principles of the mechanical presses.
The unit of product–technology–press machine / tooling is characterizing the context between the ceramic compaction technology and the design principles of the mechanical presses.
Distinctions of the die- withdrawal- and the ejection technology of the uniaxial dry- and wet-press- technique in the technical ceramics influence the approachable quality of the compactions in depending of the geometric shape of the products and in depending of the selected type of press.
Because the achievement of a speed-proportional compaction relation with pure mechanical presses is very difficult to realize and high mechanical investments are necessary, more and more combined mechanic-hydraulic function principles on base of subdivided punches will win a higher signification, because the requirements of the high-accuracy-pressing can be met better.
The design principles of particularly mechanical powder presses, explained in a dissertation of Dr.B.Froherz offer some base confrontation of advantages and disadvantages related to technology and presses especially for tool designers.

Babylon (Dr. John album)

Babylon is the second album by New Orleans R&B artist Dr. John. In his autobiography, "Under A Hoodoo Moon", Dr. John describes the origins of the album in detail:
"Our second album was cut in late 1968—the year of the Tet offensive, and of the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. It was a heavy time for me: Not only was the Vietnam War raging in all its insanity, but, as a semioutlaw, I was being pursued by various kinds of heat across L.A. In its lyrics and music, this album reflects these chaotic days. At times hard-driving, at other times following a deliberately spacy, disorienting groove, "Babylon" was the band's attempt to say something about the times—and to do it with a few unusual musical time signatures. The lead song, "Babylon", sets the tone. To a 3/4 and 10/4 groove, it lays out my own sick-ass view of the world then—namely, that I felt our number was up. We were trying to get into something...with visions of the end of the world—as if Hieronymus Bosch had cut an album."

Sexteto Habanero

The Sexteto Habanero was a famous Cuban musical group which was founded in 1920. It played an important part in the early history of the son.
In 1917 four musicians from Oriente, calling themselves "Cuarteto Oriental", recorded four numbers for "Columbia Records" in Havana. The numbers are listed in a Columbia catalog for 1921, but are probably lost. However, the same group expanded to a sextet in 1918, and were recorded by "Victor Records" in a field recording at the Hotel Inglaterra in Havana. At least one of these records has survived, giving two numbers, which are probably the first surviving songs. The new grouping called itself "Sexteto Habanero" in 1920.
Its line-up (below) was: back, L>R: Guillermo Castillo (guitar and director), Carlos Godínez (tres), Gerardo Martínez (voz prima y claves); front, L>R: Antonio Bacallao (botija), Oscar Sotolongo (square bongó) and Felipe Nerí Cabrera (maracas).
The instrumental set-up is interesting, because they use some of the original instruments of the son: the "botija" and a unique "square bongó". Soon this (and other) groups appreciated that the double bass was a musically more suitable instrument: they never went back to the botija. Five years later, the group had new members and a different look. L>R below: Agustín Gutiérrez (bongó), Abelardo Barroso (sonero, claves), Felipe Nerí Cabrera (maracas, vocals); Gerardo Martínez (double bass, vocals, leader); Guillermo Castillo (guitar, vocals), Carlos Godínez (tres, vocals).
The group's recordings in New York 1925–31 are available on LP and CD. The music is of high quality, considering the technical limitations of the time; the group won first prize in the Concurso de Sones in 1925 and 1926. When the group added a cornet, soon replaced by a trumpet, it became the "Septeto Habanero". This latter line-up lasted until the late 1930s, when sextetos were ousted by conjuntos and big bands. The leader, Gerardo Martínez then formed a new group, "Conjunto Típico Habanero".

Alexander I Palace

Alexander I Palace in Taganrog is a one-story stone building in Russian classicism style on Grecheskaya Street, 40 where Russian emperor Alexander I of Russia died in 1825. 
The mansion was built in 1806 and belonged to different owners. The most significant of them was the Governor of Taganrog Pyotr Papkov. Emperor Alexander I of Russia stayed there twice – in 1818 and 1825. After his death the building was bought by his widow empress consort Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) and the first memorial museum in Russia dedicated to the Emperor was established there. Among the visitors to the palace of Alexander I were the Russian emperors Alexander II of Russia and Alexander III, poets Alexander Pushkin and Vasily Zhukovsky, artist Ivan Aivazovsky, People’s commissar of enlightenment Anatoly Lunacharsky, and many others.
For 12 years beginning in 1864 an amateur choir conducted by Pavel Chekhov (Anton Chekhov's father) sang in the Church of Exaltation of the Cross, which was established within the mansion to honor the emperor. At the end of 1860s – beginning of 1870s Alexander, Nicolas and Anton Chekhov sang there in choral parts of descant and alto. In 1928 the memorial museum was closed and some of the exhibits were moved into the Alferaki Palace. 
The building of the Palace of Alexander I houses a children’s sanatorium called “Beryozka”.

Pterygioteuthis microlampas

Pterygioteuthis microlampas is a species of squid in the family Pyroteuthidae. They occur from northern New Zealand oceans to the Hawaiian Islands, but they do not overlap with the species "P. gemmata", which lives in more southern waters. While there are numerous similarities between these two species, they are separated by the smaller mature size of "P. microlampas" (maximum mantle length of 23 mm) and the fewer number of hooks on males. The species reproduce sexually during the late autumn to early winter, producing eggs with a diameter of 0.9 mm.

List of Lambda Literary Awards winners and nominees for science fiction, fantasy and horror

Lambda Literary Awards (also known as the "Lammys") are awarded yearly by the United States-based Lambda Literary Foundation to published works that celebrate or explore LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) themes. To qualify, a book must have been published in the United States in the year current to the official year of the award; the presentation ceremony is held a year later. The Lambda Literary Foundation states that its mission is "to celebrate LGBT literature and provide resources for writers, readers, booksellers, publishers, and librarians - the whole literary community."
Since their inception in 1989, awards have been given in various categories in fiction and non-fiction. The category for speculative fiction works has changed several times; from science fiction and mystery, to science fiction and fantasy, and finally to LGBT Sci-Fi, fantasy and horror. This category is open to submissions in the form of novels, novellas, short stories, collections and anthologies. Initially the genre categories were also split into gay men's and lesbian categories, but were merged in 1993. This article lists all the award nominees and winners for all the variously titled science fiction categories.
Multi-time winners of the award include Nicola Griffith (four wins), Melissa Scott (three wins), Clive Barker (two wins), Jim Grimsley (two wins), and Stephen Pagel (two wins). Samuel R. Delany has also won the lifetime achievement award twice. Nicola Griffith holds the record for most nominations, and Perry Brass has the most nominations without winning, having been a losing finalist four times.
Winners and nominees.
In the following table, the years correspond to the year of book's release; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Entries with a lavender background have won the relevant award; those with a white background are the nominees. Entries with a green background are current nominees, from which a winner has yet to be chosen. Superscript letters after the result indicate simultaneous nominations in other categories.

Terrorism and the Soviet Union

At the height of the Soviet Union, communism and communist states were alleged to be a major inspiration for international terrorism. Violence in the form of 'communist fighting organizations' which operated in western Europe was seen as a threat by NATO and also by the Italian, German and British governments. There are allegations that these militant groups were supported by the Soviet Union.
Allegations of promotion of terrorist organizations.
Soviet secret services have been described by GRU defectors Viktor Suvorov and Stanislav Lunev as "the primary instructors of terrorists worldwide" According to Ion Mihai Pacepa, KGB General Aleksandr Sakharovsky once said: "In today’s world, when nuclear arms have made military force obsolete, terrorism should become our main weapon." He also claimed that "Airplane hijacking is my own invention".
He claims that in 1969 alone, 82 planes were hijacked worldwide by the KGB-financed PLO. George Habash, who worked under KGB guidance, explained:
Lt. General Ion Mihai Pacepa described operation "SIG" (“Zionist Governments”) that was devised in 1972, to turn the whole Islamic world against Israel and the United States. KGB chairman Yury Andropov explained to Pacepa that
The following terrorist organizations have been established by the KGB: PLO, National Liberation Army of Bolivia (created in 1964 with help from Ernesto Che Guevara); the National Liberation Army of Colombia (created in 1965 with help from Cuba), Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine in 1969, and the Secret Army for Liberation of Armenia in 1975. 
The leader of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, established close collaboration with the Romanian Securitate service and the Soviet KGB in the beginning of the 1970s. The secret training of PLO guerrillas was provided by the KGB. However, the main KGB activities and arms shipments were channeled through Wadie Haddad of the DFLP organization, who usually stayed in a KGB dacha BARVIKHA-1 during his visits to Russia. Led by Carlos the Jackal, a group of PFLP fighters accomplished a spectacular raid the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries office in Vienna in 1975. Advance notice of this operation "was almost certainly" given to the KGB.
A number of notable operations have been conducted by the KGB to support international terrorists with weapons on the orders from the Soviet Communist Party, including:
Cold war and terrorism.
Large-scale sabotage operations have been prepared by the KGB and GRU against the United States, Canada and Europe, as alleged by intelligence historian Christopher Andrew in Mitrokhin Archive and in books by former GRU and SVR officers Victor Suvorov and Stanislav Lunev, and Kouzminov. Among the planned operations were the following:
According to Lunev, a probable scenario in the event of war would be poisoning of the Potomac River with chemical or biological weapons, "targeting the residents of Washington DC". He also noted that it is "likely" that GRU operatives have placed already "poison supplies near the tributaries to major US reservoirs." This information was confirmed by Alexander Kouzminov, who was responsible for transporting dangerous pathogens from around the world for Russian program of biological weapons in the 1980s and the beginning of 1990s. He described a variety of biological terrorism acts that would be carried out on the order of the Russian President in the event of hostilities, including poisoning public drinking-water supplies and food processing plants. At the end of the 1980s, the Soviet Union "was the only country in the world that could start and win a global biological war, something we had already established that the West was not ready for.", according to Kouzminov.

<doc id="20193895" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20193895" title="Central pain syndrome">
Central pain syndrome

Central pain syndrome is a neurological condition caused by damage or malfunction in the Central Nervous System (CNS) which causes a sensitization of the pain system. The extent of pain and the areas affected are related to the cause of the injury. 
Symptoms.
Pain can either be relegated to a specific part of the body or spread to the entire body. It is typically constant, and may be moderate to severe in intensity. It is often made worse by touch, movement, emotions, and temperature changes, usually cold temperatures along with many other similar 'triggers'. Burning pain is the most common sensation, but patients also report pins and needles, pressing, lacerating, aching, and extreme bursts or constant sharp or unremitting excruciating pain. Individuals may have reduced sensitivity to touch in the areas affected by the pain, as if a part of us is 'falling asleep'. The burning and loss of sense of touch are usually, but not always, most severe on the distant parts of the body, such as the feet or hands, spreading until it is in some cases felt from head to toe. For some patients with intense affliction, there often can be unremitting nausea, causing vomiting. The pain can also bring on hyperventilation. Blood pressure can rise due to the pain.
Cause.
Damage to the CNS can be caused by car accidents, limb amputations, trauma, spinal cord injury, tumors, stroke,  immune system disorders or diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's, Graves or Addison's disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, and epilepsy. It may develop months or years after injury or damage to the CNS. 
Treatment.
Pain medications often provide some reduction of pain, but not complete relief of pain, for those affected by central pain syndrome. Tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline or anticonvulsants such as neurontin (gabapentin) can be useful. Lowering stress levels appears to reduce pain. For regular treatment some people prefer body length heating pads while others rely on warm baths, and most any normal 'hot or cold' help.
Prognosis.
Central pain syndrome is not a fatal disorder, but the syndrome causes disabling chronic pain and suffering among the majority of individuals who have it.

Hudugaata

Hudugaata (Kannada: ಹುಡುಗಾಟ) is a 2007 Kannada film directed by Sanjay K and produced by B.G. Babu Reddy under the "Nitin productions" banner. The film stars Golden Star Ganesh, Rekha Vedavyas and Avinash in pivotal roles. The soundtrack, composed by Jassie Gift, was launched on 27 May 2007. It was originally planned to be released on 1 June 2007, but the film released on 8 June 2007. It completed its 100 days run successfully. The film is a remake of the Hindi "Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin" which itself was a remake of the Hollywood movie "It Happened One Night".
Plot.
"Hudugaata" is a fun-filled story with light-hearted comedy throughout. Balu Mahendar (Ganesh) is a crime reporter at a popular newspaper. His division gets shifted to a sports reporter because of his hudugaata. He is sent to interview a sports personality in Kanyakumari. From here, the romantic journey starts. He meets the heroine who needs help in the bus. He promises to help her in return for an exclusive news item about her in his newspaper. Will the heroine be able to get what she needs? Will Balu Mahender complete his assigned job? Look out for a comedy edition of this story on the screen.
Review.
Ganesh, the golden star of comedy, has done an excellent job. He retains his "Mungaru Male" style of dialogues in many scenes which makes people jump with whistles. Rekha has done a good job and looks pretty on screen. Avinash and Komal Kumar have done justice to their comedy roles. Evergreen Shobraj comes in to the frames for some action scenes with Ganesh and for some comedy.
Sanjay, even though this is his first movie as a director, makes no mistakes; he has performed extremely well and succeeds in making people laugh. Jassie Gift has given fantastic songs and enjoyable background music all through the movie. Songs are the major plus point.

Vincenzo Anastagi

Vincenzo Anastagi (died 1585) was an Italian Knight of Rhodes who participated in the Siege of Malta (1565). He had joined the Knights two years before the siege.
Sallying with about a hundred cavalry from Mdina, he led a surprise cavalry charge against the poorly guarded Turkish camp on August 7th, while the main Turkish force was engaged in an assault on Birgu and Senglea. The assault would have likely succeeded were it not for the intervention of Anastagi's cavalry that created a confusion in the Turkish rear.
In the words of a modern historian: "Malta survived on 7 August purely through Anastagi's lucky strike". 
In 1585 he was nominated as Captain of the Galera Capitana, but then murdered by two fellow knights.
His portrait was painted by El Greco sometime between 1571 and 1576.

Roland MKS-80

The Roland MKS-80 Super Jupiter is an 8-voice polyphonic analog synthesizer that was manufactured by Roland between 1984 and 1987. It is the only of MKS series of synthesizers to have fully analog voltage controlled oscillators. Contrary to popular belief, the voice architecture is more closely related to the Jupiter-6 synthesizer than the Jupiter-8, the service manual states that "The module board of MKS-80 features the following in addition to that of JP-6, its brother module. ) HPF_ )Low boost circuit in the 2nd VCA. )DC supply current boost circuit." The unit is fully capable of producing most of the Jupiter-8's signature sounds, in addition to many sounds unique to the MKS-80. In 1985 out came another revision of MKS-80, known as "Rev 5", that had no ties with any previous Jupiter's hardware, as it used a new generation of both Roland VCO's, VCA's and filter. The Rev 5 filter was also used in JX-8P, JX-10 and MKS-70 synthesizers.
Features.
The voice architecture of the MKS-80 is fully analog with 8 polyphonic voices with 2 voltage controlled oscillators (VCO) per voice, using the Curtis CEM3340 VCO integrated cirtuit. The unit also includes one voltage controlled filter (VCF) and one voltage controlled amplifier (VCA) per voice.
The MKS-80 has a 64 patch internal memory (8 banks of 8 patches each) along with an optional memory cartridge called the M64-C with room for another 64. A full MIDI implementation is built into the MKS-80, with MIDI IN, OUT and THRU jacks positioned at the rear of the unit.
External Programmer.
The MPG-80 is the optional programmer designed specifically for the MKS-80, providing direct access to the majority of the MKS-80's features. The MPG-80 connects to the MKS-80 via the Controller port using a special cable. When used with an MPG-80, the MKS-80's MIDI IN port is not used in favor of the MIDI IN on the MPG-80.

The City Without Jews

Die Stadt ohne Juden ("The City Without Jews") is an Austrian Expressionist film made in 1924 by H. K. Breslauer, based on the book of the same title by Hugo Bettauer. The film is one of the few surviving Expressionist films from Austria, and has therefore been well researched. The film was first shown on 25 July 1924 in Vienna.
In his novel, published in 1922, Hugo Bettauer succeeded in creating a relatively accurate allegorical vision of the near future, although the book was intended as entertainment and as a satirical response to the primitive antisemitism of the 1920s. It immediately became Bettauer's most popular work: it was translated into several languages, and sold over a quarter of a million copies. Shortly after the premiere of the film Hugo Bettauer was murdered by Otto Rothstock, a former member of the Nazi Party, who was lionized by the antisemitic Austrian masses and was released from jail shortly after his conviction for murder.
Plot.
In Austria the Christian Social Party comes to power, and the new Chancellor Dr. Schwerdtfeger, a fanatical antisemite, sees his people as being ruled by the Jews. He therefore has a law passed by the National Assembly forcing all Jews to emigrate by the end of the year. The law is enthusiastically received by the non-Jewish population, and the Jews leave the country. But after a short time a sober reality makes itself felt. Cultural life becomes impoverished: in the theatres only plays by Ludwig Ganghofer and Ludwig Anzengruber are still performed. Many cafes are empty, or are converted into beer halls selling sausages. After an initial upturn, the economy declines, as business has greatly diminished, and has moved to other cities, such as Prague and Budapest. Inflation and unemployment run wild.
The political characters of the book (although not of the film, in order to avoid difficulties with censorship) are delineated in such a way as to be identifiable with real politicians of the period: Bundeskanzler Schwerdtfeger, for example, is based on Ignaz Seipel. Besides the political action, the film also dwells on the love relationship between Lotte (Anny Milety), a typical Viennese girl ("Wiener Mädel") and the daughter of a member of the National Assembly who voted for the banishment of the Jews, and the Jewish artist Leo Strakosch (Joseph Riemann).
Towards the end of the film the National Assembly resolves to bring the Jews back again. However, in order to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority, Lotte and Leo, who has already illegally returned to Austria with forged papers identifying him as a French painter, have to remove the antisemitic Parliamentary representative Bernard (played by Hans Moser), which they do by getting him drunk. The drama reaches a peak as he is committed to a psychiatric institution represented in Expressionist scenery, where in a claustrophobic and asymmetrically painted cell he sees himself threatened by Stars of David. 
This sequence also represents the divergence of the film from the book, as the action of the film is revealed as a dream of the antisemitic Councillor Bernard. This surprising turn of events was described in the original film programme as follows:
"In this moment of the highest distress Councillor Bernard awakes from his dream, finds himself in the tavern at a very late hour and says to the baffled Volbert: 'Thank God that stupid dream is over - we are all just people and we don't want hate - we want life - we want to live together in peace.'"
Background.
The film was made in 1924, about two years after the publication of Bettauer's novel, which in several essential particulars differs from the film version. For one thing, the city in the film is called "Utopia", instead of "Vienna", as in the book. For another, the film produces a conciliatory happy ending, which is not only the exact opposite of the message of the book, but also represents a surprising and abrupt change of direction within the film itself, the whole of which is thus revealed as the dream of an antisemite who at last comes to the realisation that the Jews are a "necessary evil". The reason for these fundamental deviations from the original was to reduce the controversial political impact of the content.
Hans Moser had in this film his second ever cinematic role. The female lead was played, as so often in Breslauer's films, by Anny (or Anna) Milety, whom he later married (in 1925). The well-known Jewish actors Gisela Werbisek (billed as "Werbezirk") and Armin Berg appeared only in minor roles, as Kathi the cook and Isidor the commissionaire. The Expressionist backdrops and decor which characterise some scenes were the work of Julius von Borsody.
Other cast members were Eugen Neufeld (Bundeskanzler Dr. Schwerdtfeger), Karl Thema (Cllr. Linder), Ferdinand Mayerhofer (Cllr. Volbert), Mizi Griebl (Volbert's wife) and Hans Effenberger (Alois Carroni).
Performance history.
The premiere took place on 25 July 1924 in Vienna, although there were still technical problems with the film. Bettauer and Breslauer, the director, fell out entirely, and Bettauer later refused to acknowledge any connection between the film and his book. The technically inferior prints of the film were often manually cut and shortened by the cinema owners themselves. Nevertheless the cinema auditoriums were often full, although not only in Austria but also in Berlin (premiere 1926) and New York (premiere 1928, where it was shown as "The City Without Jews"), it was very clear that the success of the film was not as great as that of the book. There were sometimes disturbances at performances: National Socialists often threw stinkbombs into the cinemas; in Linz the showing of the film was banned.
A campaign of vilification against Bettauer was instigated, partly because of this film and partly because of other activities of his. In the spring of 1925 he was murdered by a NSDAP member, Otto Rothstock, who was hailed as a hero and despite being found guilty of murder, was soon set free.
In 1933 the film was shown commercially for the last time, again causing a stir, when it was screened in the Amsterdam theatre "Carré" as a protest against Hitler's Germany. This copy of the film is presumably the same as the one discovered in 1991 in the Nederlands Filmmuseum. It was on a cellulose nitrate base and on the point of disintegration. The German Bundesarchiv in Coblenz therefore made an "emergency copy", which was then reconstructed on behalf of the Filmarchiv Austria (Austrian Film Archive) by the company HS-ART Digital Service of Graz using the "DIAMANT" software developed by Joanneum Research; faded parts were then re-coloured.
In October 2008 the film was made available on a portable medium for the first time as part of the DVD series "Der österreichische Film".
Critical reaction.
"In many places the film follows the original book almost word for word, which makes the Utopian ending even more obviously an expression of appeasement. At the end the surprised audience learns that the entire dramatic action only took place in a dream, and thus never really happened. The on-screen happy ending, dictated by compromise, not only negates the meaning of Bettauer's book but also the very real antisemitism that it reflects. Instead it documents a by no means unthinkable and in no way dreamlike reality [...] This surprising turn of the plot, deviating totally from the literary original, which simplifies the action as the content of a dream, cannot merely be regarded as a simple dramatic exigency, but as a prime example of the Austrian soul's ability to repress. This naïve and perhaps crude experiment from 1924 can be taken as a forerunner of what was generally practised after World War II in the country "ohne Eigenschaften""(Thomas Ballhausen, Günter Krenn, 2006).

The Linen Memorial

The Linen Memorial, conceived and created in 2001 by Lycia Danielle Trouton is made from almost 400 Irish linen handkerchiefs listing almost 4000 names of those killed during the fraught period in contemporary Northern Ireland, called 'The Troubles';. It was conceived in 1999 after the artist exhibited at The Waterworks, Antrim Road, North Belfast. Subsequently, Lycia did research into the fabric of linen, at The Linen Museum, Lisburn and also toured a former flax scutching mill in the Irish countryside.
The Memorial was first unveiled on September 7, 2001 in Washington state, USA, as part of an ecumenical project with the names list on printed handkerchiefs and a 'coffin' represented in compressed peat moss (Irish bog oak). The 2002 in Australia showing on The Day of the Dead featured a soundscape by Thomas Fitzgerald (composer) which incorporated Kevin McFadden's Gaelic poetry, with oration by Anthony Stamboulieh, and a performance with choreography by Elizabeth Cameron Dalman, OAM, and her Mirramu Dance Company. In 2004, the printed names on the handkerchiefs were embroidered by volunteers, with more than 200 completed by 2010.
The Linen Memorial was initially exhibited in Northern Ireland at the Corrymeela Community Centre for Peace and Reconciliation on June 21, 2007 and 2008, in recognition of the first Day of Private Reflection; both showings included a names reading, and in 2008, persons who so wished could pin a memento or token of remembrance, beside a name on a handkerchief. The Linen Memorial was also exhibited at the Flax and Linen Biennale in Quebec in 2011.

De primo Saxonum adventu

" De primo Saxonum adventu " is a historical work, probably written in Durham during the episcopate of Ranulf Flambard (1099–1128). It recounts the coming of the English (called the "Saxons") to Great Britain, treating individually the history of the rulers of the Kingdom of Kent, the Kingdom of East Anglia, the Kingdom of Northumbria (to Erik Bloodaxe), as well as the archbishops of Canterbury and the archbishops of York, the bishops of Durham and the earls of Northumbria.
Although it exists in many recensions updated in later years, the earliest version contains a list of Durham bishops, ending with Ranulf Flambard. It was written in the time of Symeon of Durham, and thus Symeon may have had a role in the authorship of the text. It appears to be related to a text called the "Series regum Northymbrensium", a list of rulers of Northumbria beginning with Ida and ending with Henry I, a text existing only in the manuscript Cambridge University Library, Ff. i.27, one of the ten manuscripts containing the "Libellus de exordio".

Deinking

Deinking is the industrial process of removing printing ink from paperfibers of recycled paper to make deinked pulp.
The key in the deinking process is the ability to detach ink from the fibers. This is achieved by a combination of mechanical action and chemical means. In Europe the most common process is froth flotation deinking.
Paper is one of the main targets for recycling. A concern about recycling wood pulp paper is that the fibers are degraded with each cycle and after being recycled 4–6 times the fibers become too short and weak to be useful in making paper.
History.
Before the invention of the paper machine in 1799 the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, hence the name rag paper. The rags were from hemp, linen and cotton. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was independent of recycled materials.
Recycling of used paper before the industrialisation of paper production, rag paper was recycled to make low-grade board. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. He practiced together with German paper producer Johann Engelhard Schmid. Today this method is called deinking.
First in the 1950s and 1960s the use of recycled fibres from paper made of wood pulp begun to increase, and was mainly used in packaging paper and paperboard. In the 1950s the froth flotation technique was adapted for deinking recycled paper. Use of recovered paper increased in the 1970s mainly in graphic and hygienic papers, and accelerated in the 1980s. The annual growth in use of recovered paper increased by 6% between 1980 and 1996. The use of virgin fibres only increased 2% in the same period. In 1997 recovered paper production was 42% of the total paper production.
Deinking process.
Sorting.
Waste paper may contain a mixture of different paper types made of mixtures of different paperfibers. These must be sorted before processed. Broke (paper waste from paper production) is normally used directly in the papermachine.
Recycled paper can be used to make paper of the same or lower quality than it was originally. The sorted paper is baled and shipped to a papermill. The pulpmill uses waste paper grade according to the paper quality they want to make.
Debaling.
The bales are opened and large foreign objects are sorted out on the conveyor belt to the pulper. Many extraneous materials are readily removed. Twine, strapping, etc. are removed from the hydropulper by a "ragger". Metal straps and staples can be screened out or removed by a magnet. Film-backed pressure-sensitive tape stays intact: the PSA adhesive and the backing are both removed together.
Pulping.
Pulpers are either batch, which uses a tub with a high shear rotor, or continuous, using a long, perforated drum. Drum pulpers are very expensive but have the advantage of not breaking up contaminants, thus giving cleaner end product.
The pulper chops the paper to smaller pieces, water and chemicals are added. Normally the pH is adjusted to 8,5 - 10,0. Normal deinking chemicals are: 
After pulping the mixture is a slurry. The slurry goes to screening.
Cleaning and screening.
Centrifugal cleaning is spinning the pulp slurry in a cleaner, causing materials that are denser than pulp fibers to move outward and be rejected. Screens, with either slots or holes, are used to remove contaminants that are larger than pulp fibers.
Materials which are more difficult to remove include wax coatings on corrugated cartons and stickies, soft rubbery particles which can make deposits and contaminate the recycled paper. Stickies can originate from book bindings, hot melt adhesives, PSA adhesives from paper labels, laminating adhesives of reinforced gummed tapes, etc.
Deinking stage.
In the deinking stage the goal is to release and remove the hydrophobic contaminants from the recycled paper. The contaminants are mostly printing ink and stickies. Several processes are used, most commonly flotation or washing.
Washing / dewatering.
Washing / dewatering (thickening) is a filtration process. Small particles (< 5 µm) are removed by passing water through the pulp.
Bleaching.
If white paper is desired, bleaching uses peroxides or hydrosulfites to increase the brightness of the pulp. The bleaching methods are similar for mechanical pulp, but the goal is to make the fiber brighter.
Papermaking.
The deinked fiber is made into a new paper product in the same way that virgin wood fiber, see papermaking.
Byproducts.
The unusable material left over, mainly ink, plastics, filler and short fibers, is called sludge. The sludge is buried in a landfill, burned to create energy at the paper mill or used as a fertilizer by local farmers.
Problems.
Water based flexographic printing inks with particle sizes below 5 µm and poor solubility in alkaline conditions may cause problems in deinking, especially in the flotation stage. The solution is to use an extra acidic washing stage.
Temperature control is important as this affects the stickiness of stickies.

The book is divided into three sections:
Excerpt.
Incipit:
"June 1958" -- 
"I am working with Fellini and Tullio Pinelli, dusting off an old idea of ours for a film, the one about a young provincial who comes to Rome to become a journalist. Fellini wants to adapt the idea to the present day, to paint a picture of this “wog society” that frolics between eroticism, alienation, boredom and sudden affluence. It is a society which, the terrors of the cold war now past and perhaps even in reaction to them, flourishes a bit everywhere. But in Rome, through a mixing together of the sacred and the profane, of the old and the new, through the "en masse" arrival of foreigners, through the cinema, presents more aggressive, subtropical qualities. The film will have "La dolce Vita" as its title and we have yet to write a single line of it; we are vaguely taking notes and going to the different places around town to refresh our memories."

Kotle-khor cave

Kotle-khor cave is a cave in Iran. It is located 140 km. south west of Zanjan, in the southern skirts of the Saqizloo mountains. 
The inlet to this cave stands 6–8 m. above a dry river. The beauty of this cave is enhanced due to the formation of stalactites and stalagmites because of calcified precipitation. Besides these are icicles suspended from the roof and these conical shaped hangings due to impurities are multicolored, whereas some are crystal clear.
In the larger passages, a constant trickle of water has brought about the presence of beautiful designs notable shapes similar to a cauliflower (due to presence of calcified material, it resembles the same) these cauliflowers are also multi-colored. On the cave flooring a skeleton of a four legged animal, which has been converted to a calcified compound, can also be noted. En route to this cave, leisure spots filled with natural beauty enhance the eye of the onlooker, besides having rest-houses and places of pilgrimage.

Murder of Garry Newlove

Garry Newlove (5 November 1959 - 12 August 2007) was an English man beaten to death in August 2007 in the UK. His murder launched an upset in the UK over the two offenders who had been drinking underage. Former Chief Constable Peter Fahy called for the legal age of buying alcohol to increase to the age of 21 as a result of the Garry Newlove murder. His widow Helen Newlove condemned the Government for failing to get to grips with youth disorder afterwards.
Incident.
Newlove was attacked outside his house in Warrington, Cheshire, on 10 August 2007, having gone outside to confront a gang of youths who he suspected had vandalised his wife's Renault Scenic car. He died in hospital two days later.
Arrests.
Three teenagers were arrested and charged with his murder on 14 August 2007 and remanded in custody. A fourth teenager was charged and remanded the next day and the fifth and final suspect was charged and remanded on 13 September.
Adam Swellings, 19 and from Crewe, went on trial at Chester Crown Court charged with the murder on 14 November 2007, along with two 17-year-olds, a 16-year-old and a 15-year-old who could not be named for legal reasons.
Verdicts.
On 16 January 2008, Swellings was convicted of Mr Newlove's murder, along with 17-year-old Stephen Sorton and 16-year-old Jordan Cunliffe. The two other teenagers were cleared of any involvement in the killing and walked free from court. The three convicted murderers were remanded in custody until being sentenced to life imprisonment on 11 February 2008. The trial judge recommended that Swellings, Sorton and Cunliffe should serve minimum terms of 17, 15 and 12 years respectively.
Appeals.
Swellings and Sorton appealed against their convictions and sentences. Their case was heard at the Court of Appeal on 13 November 2008. Swellings lost the appeal against his conviction and sentence, although Sorton won a two-year reduction on his minimum sentence.
Newlove's widow, Helen Newlove, joined forces with the local and national media, in particular "The Sun" newspaper, to campaign for a clampdown on gangs like the one who claimed her husband's life, with heavier prison sentences and a return of the death penalty for murder. She also campaigns for better control on binge drinking. In recognition of her campaigning, Helen Newlove was ennobled as Baroness Newlove in 2010. 
Cunliffe later appealed against his murder conviction on the grounds that he had not taken part in the attack on Mr Newlove, although he had been present when it happened. On 26 July 2010, the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal. He is now reported to be challenging his murder conviction (obtained on the grounds of joint enterprise as he reportedly did not take part in the attack despite being present when the others took part) on the grounds that he could barely see the attack taking place due to a degenerative eye condition, which he and his supporters (including his mother Janet) claim would make him not guilty of murder. The campaign also calls for an end to the ability of the legal system to secure a murder conviction against someone on the grounds of joint enterprise if they were present but did not actually commit the killing. BAFTA winning screen-writer Jimmy McGovern is reportedly using the case of Jordan Cunliffe as a base for a new television drama.

Silenziosa Luna

"Silenziosa luna" is a quotation from Giacomo Leopardi's poem "Canto notturno di un pastore errante dell'Asia".
The album includes works written by Forlivesi between 1999 and 2008. Its 28-page booklet reflects the artistic and cultural concerns of the team about this recording. The linear notes provide information about the musicians and lyrics, and give details on the extent of each musical work, placing them in cultural and creative contexts. They were written in Italian originally and directly translated into Japanese and English, respectively by Japanese musicologist Mariko Kanemitsu and British composer/poet Jeremy Drake. Japanese "jiuta-mai" dancer Sayuri Uno, American academic Laura Hein (Northwestern University) and Italian philosopher Marco Forlivesi (University of Padua) also made a significant contribution to this process.
The recording gathers accomplished masters and new-generation virtuosos, while the instrumental techniques developed on purpose for these works are likely to be among the most demanding ever written for these kind of instruments. The recording technology employed (24bit/96kHz) brings forth clarity of sound and dynamics, delicacy and a high dynamic range, with a main focus on timbre, textures and transparency.
The artistic photograph reproduced on the album cover is a shot taken by Carlo Forlivesi and Sayuri Uno in "Shisendō", a historic spot in Kyoto; it represents a round-shaped Tsukubai enhanced by natural shadows and reflections. In spite of the apparent complexity of the layers it is a non-processed image.
The disc fits the same round-shaped Tsukubai picture finely emulated with sprinkled silver and gold colors, and bears a strong resemblance to maki-e making.

Montfort Browne

Montfort Browne (fl. 1760–1780) was a British Army officer and Tory, and a major landowner and developer of British West Florida in the 1760s and 1770s. He commanded the Prince of Wales' American Regiment, a Loyalist regiment, in the American Revolutionary War. He served as lieutenant governor of West Florida from 1766 to 1769, acting as governor from 1767, and then as governor of the Bahamas from 1774 to 1780.
Life.
Montfort Browne was from an Irish family. According to his own writings, he served in the 35th Regiment of Foot during the Seven Years' War, where he saw much action in the West Indies, and was twice wounded. In 1763 a complaint was lodged against him that resulted in an unfavourable court of inquiry against him. When the British took control of West Florida after the war, Browne sponsored French Huguenot and Irish immigrants to the area. Through a patronage connection with the colonial secretary, the Earl of Hillsborough, he secured the lieutenant governorship of the new province in November 1764. Accompanied by his Irish recruits, he arrived at the provincial capital, Pensacola in January 1766.
West Florida.
His first year as lieutenant governor was turbulent. Some of his land claims were contested, and the property he owned on Dauphin Island was found to be unsuitable for the population he had planned to settle there. His relationship with Governor George Johnstone was strained when Browne sided with the military in disputes between them and the governor. Johnstone left West Florida in January 1767, leaving Browne in command of the province.
Browne in 1768 led a successful expedition out to the Natchez area, bringing back a report of the fertility and emptiness of that area and suggesting that the area be developed. For his services in the war he had been awarded in the province, and he used the trip to stake out large parcels of land on the eastern banks of the Mississippi River just north of present-day Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Irregularities in Browne's bookkeepping in 1768 drew criticism from his patron Hillsborough, and Browne formally requested that his books be audited when Johnstone's successor John Eliot arrived in April 1769. Unfortunately, Eliot committed suicide a month after his arrival, and Browne reluctantly retook the reins of power. He sent the provincial surveyor, Elias Durnford to London in May 1769 to answer ongoing complaints that colonists were making against him, but Durnford returned that December with orders removing Browne from power and granting Durnford an acting governorship.
As Browne was preparing to leave the province he was involved in a duel with a Pensacolan trader. The man was wounded, and Browne would have faced criminal charges had the man died. Fortunately for Browne he recovered, and Browne sailed for England in February 1770. He spent much of the next two years in England, having his finances scrutinized by the colonial office, and continuing to drum up interest in settlements on the Mississippi. There was public speculation on both sides of the Atlantic that the Mississippi lands would eventually be separated into their own province, with Browne as its governor. Hillsborough was apparently supportive of the idea, and resigned as colonial secretary when it was rejected. Browne continued to lobby Hillsborough's successor, the Earl of Darthmouth, for the establishment of a province on the Mississippi, but was unsuccessful. He was instead eventually granted the governorship of The Bahamas in March 1774.
Bahamas and Revolutionary War service.
While governor of the Bahamas, Browne continued to promote land on the Mississippi. At one point he advertised for sale tracts of land as large as , suggesting that he had acquired more land while in England. He made several trips from the Bahamas to West Florida to pursue his interests in 1774 and 1775.
After the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775 he took some precautions to secure Nassau. He had had ample warning that the Americans might make an attack there, but was caught off guard when American ships arrived off Nassau's sandbar on the morning of 3 March 1776. He rushed to Government House in his nightshirt to order the firing of cannon to summon the militia. Though he managed to get most of the island's gunpowder stores away to St. Augustine, Florida, he failed to hold the island and was taken prisoner. With 12 other high-ranking hostages from the island he was taken back to the Chesapeake Bay by the American fleet, and was released soon afterwards in exchange for William Alexander.
He then formed the Loyalist Prince of Wales' American Regiment, served at the siege of Rhode Island, and spent some time in Florida before finally returning to the Bahamas to resume his post there in July 1778. He then faced accusations of cowardice and incompetence for his conduct of the battle and, after dismissing his council in an attempt to scotch the rumours (an unprecedented move), he was replaced by John Robert Maxwell two years later in 1780.

Psorophora howardii

Psorophora howardii is a species of mosquitoes. The species was described by the American entomologist Daniel William Coquillett in 1901.
Description.
This mosquito is very large, has shaggy legs, and has a wing length of . The scales on the wings are narrow and dark brown. The proboscis is long and brown. The palpi are nearly half as long as the proboscis and brown. The proboscis and the palpi are covered with setae. The head has broad, flat, grayish-white scales except for a narrow median bare stripe. The thorax is dark brown to black. The abdomen has a broad median patch of white scales. The legs are dark yellow and purple. The adult females are persistent biters and will attack at any time of the day. It can spread the West Nile virus, and can puncture clothing such as through a coat, vest, and two shirts since the species is 8 to 10 mm long.
Habitat.
The mosquito can be found in the Southeastern United States, Mexico, the West Indies, and Central America, breeding in rain pools, grassy ditches, and depressions. "P. howardii" can be found in citrus furrow irrigation systems in coastal southeastern Florida; it oviposits low in the furrows. The eggs hatch by rainfall and irrigation.
Larvae.
The larvae occur from March to October, and can be found in unshaded or partly shaded temporary rain-filled pools. They are large, and prey on the larvae of other mosquitoes. To collect a field sample, a long-handled dipper causes a minimum of disturbance to the larvae. An area sampler is used after the dipper which catches more.

Stover at Yale

Stover at Yale, by Owen Johnson is a novel describing undergraduate life at Yale at the turn of the 20th century. The book was described by F. Scott Fitzgerald as the "textbook of his generation". "Stover at Yale" recounts Dink Stover's navigation through the social structure at Yale and his struggles with social pressure.
Plot summary.
Setting the Stage (Chapters 1-3).
The story opens with a picture of Stover seating himself on a train bound for New Haven. We get a very short recap of Stover's background from his Lawrenceville days (recounted in "The Varmint") where Stover overcame a poor start to distinguish himself on the gridiron and became a class leader. While Stover is poised in dress and bearing (Johnson a bit pokes fun at Stover's self-awareness of that), around him his classmates are more eager and juvenile. Stover listens to them talk around him and learns of the secret society system, which will be the main drama of the plot. Later, the tap ceremony for the Yale senior society Skull and Bones is vividly described.
While on the train, Stover also meets Tom Regan, an older, physically imposing and more open classmate of his, as well as LeBaron, a leading sophomore who is already taking Stover under his wing. 
Arriving at his campus lodgings, Stover meets several more characters who will play parts in the following chapters. With Tough McCarty, his rival became friend from Lawrenceville days, Stover has a joyous roughhouse. He also meets McNabb, who is the "partier" of the freshman class. With Hunter, who is reserved and poised for leadership, Stover instantly feels rivalry. A sophomore, Reynolds, "an undersized nervous fellow" but first in his class to "make the News", stops by to check on the Andover freshmen in the house. He evaluates each man and advises him on what to go after in terms of extracurriculars. Some comic relief is afforded when Rogers, a junior stops by, and the tone changes to Reynolds deferring while Rogers leads the group in antagonizing a group of sophomores by turning lights on and off.
The chapter concludes with Stover's dinner with LeBaron. LeBaron counsels Stover on the importance of winning election to a secret society. Stover is troubled by the seriousness of this social positioning. Back with Tough, Stover then tells Tough to "go slow" about making new friendships, nixing Tough's plan for a dining group to put the two of them with a more select bunch, but has a hard time explaining his motivation.
Establishing himself in the class (Chapters 4-27).
The action then shifts to the gridiron. Stover performs well at basic drills, but gets no praise and is not called on to scrimmage. Tompkins, one of the coaches, cautions him, “Stover, just one word for your good. You come up with a big prep school reputation. Don't make an ass of yourself." 
Later, Stover meets Gimbal, who openly proclaims a plan to fight the society system. Gimbal is also open about looking for political leadership with his anti-society stance. The two shake hands, but Stover is uncertain what to make of Gimbal.
In the evening, Stover and his class take part in wrestling contests against the sophomores. When no one from his class will stand in as the middleweight, Stover volunteers, though he knows no wrestling. Stover uses his football tackling power to beat his opponent, despite the other man's better knowledge of wrestling. Dana, the football captain, and Tompkins, the coach, see Stover's incredible tackling power and recognize him for it, enthusiastically and sparingly. Stover is borne home by his classmates, having established himself as a name in the class.
Stover reconnects with Regan, who had avoided the wrestling match and the first week of practice, despite his huge size, preferring to concentrate on personal affairs and school. Stover also meets other members of the class: Bob Story, son of an influential judge, as well as Joe Hungerford, a "name known across the world for power in finance." Stover, with Hungerford's encouragement, persuades Regan to become the waiter for their dining club.
In football practice, Stover at first is disappointed that his wrestling heroics do not suddenly win him a place on the team, but eventually he gets placed as the end on the scrub team. He battles a senior, Bangs, who is the starting end, and outplays him dramatically. Bangs resents Stover's presence as threatening a position that he spent three years building toward.
Publication history.
"Stover at Yale" was originally serialized in McClure's in 1911. The copyright has expired and the work has passed into public domain.
Commentary and reviews.
There were varied reactions to the book.

Joan Croft Halt railway station

Joan Croft Halt railway station was a small halt on the East Coast Main Line (ECML) situated by the level crossing at Joan Croft Junction in South Yorkshire, England. The junction gives access from the ECML to the Skellow line of the West Riding and Grimsby Railway and eventually to Hull, Immingham and Grimsby Docks.
The halt consisted of two flanking platforms to the south of the level crossing with brick built station buildings on the York-bound side. These buildings still stand in private use. The station was set in the countryside with just a few cottages situated either side at some distance.
The station was not, possibly never, shown in railway timetables.
The station opened circa 1920 and closed in the 1950s.
In May 2011 Network Rail applied to the Infrastructure Planning Commission for permission to construct a North Doncaster chord to link two lines, the Askern line and the Skellow line, with a viaduct passing above Joan Croft junction. As part of the proposed works, the Joan Croft level crossing will be closed and replaced by a road bridge. Closing the level crossing will allow the overhead wires on the ECML to be lowered (because the wires will no longer have to be higher than the highest road vehicle plus a safety margin), thus allowing the new railway viaduct to be constructed at a lower level.

Lev Leshchenko

Lev Valerjanovich Leshchenko (; born 1 February 1942), is a renowned Russian singer, who was best known for his rendition of "Den Pobedy" and the 1980 Summer Olympics closing ceremony theme song "Do svidanja, Moskva".
Biography.
Lev Leshchenko was born on 1 February 1942 in Moscow, Soviet Union. His father, Valerjan Andreevich (1904–2004), was a Red Army officer who was at war outside of Moscow. He was accorded with medals for participation in the Second World War. His mother, Claudia Petrovna Leshchenko (1915 to 1943), died shortly after Leshchenko was born. His grandparents, along with his stepmother Irina Pavlovna Leshchenko, whom his father remarries in 1948, brought Leshchenko up in Sokolniki, Moscow. It was during his childhood when he was influenced from classical music and theatre, and began performing popular songs of Leonid Utyosov.
Between 1960 and 1959, Leshchenko worked as a stage helper at the State Academic Bolshoi Theatre, and before being conscripted into the army in 1961, he worked as an adjuster at a precision measuring instrument factory. Leschenko served in the mechanical vehicle division of the Soviet Army, positioned in the German Democratic Republic. On 27 January 1962, Leshchenko (then a private) became a soloist within the Soviet Red Army Ensemble, and received the offer to remain in the army. Leshchenko accepted every role offered to him by the ensemble, namely singing in a quarter, conducting concerts and even reading verses, where it is often said to have begun his entertainment career. At the same time, he was preparing for theatrical examinations for Russian Academy of Theatre Arts (abbreviated as GITIS), the most renowned theatrical school of the Soviet Union, which he passed and was successfully admitted to in September 1964.
Leshchenko began touring with concert bands, visiting some of the more isolated parts of the country. In 1969, Leshchenko was admitted as a member of the Moscow Operetta Theatre. He experienced with many roles, but was aware of his musical gift, and was constantly seeking for soloist acts. On 13 February 1970, having successfully gone through a contest held by the state radio station, Leshchenko became a solo vocalist for the Soviet state radio station.
In 1975, Leshchenko became the first singer who dared to perform "Den Pobedy" (an immensely popular Soviet song dedicated to the Victory Day, which was initially disliked by the authorities due to the unconventional music style). His rendition has become by far the most successful.

Bills horse troughs

Bills horse troughs are watering troughs that were manufactured in Australia and installed to provide relief for working horses in the first half of the twentieth century. The troughs were financed by a trust fund established through the will of George Bills. A total of around 700 troughs were distributed by the trust in Australia and 50 in several other countries.
George and Annis Bills.
George Bills was born in Brighton in England in 1859. He migrated with his family to New Zealand and subsequently to Echuca, Victoria in Australia in 1873. In 1882 he opened a bird dealers shop in Brisbane, where he met and married Annis Swann who had immigrated from Sheffield in England. In 1884 the couple moved to Sydney and George Bills went into business with his brothers, manufacturing innerspring mattresses. In 1908, George retired to Hawthorn, Victoria and in 1910, Annis died while the couple were visiting England. George became a Life Governor of the RSPCA in 1924.
Trust fund.
George and Annis had no children, and following the death of George in 1927, a trust fund was set up, believed to be around ₤70-80,000. One of the purposes of the trust, as set out in George Bill's will, was to:
Each trough cost ₤13 plus transport and installation . The majority of the troughs were installed in Victoria and New South Wales between 1930 and 1939.
Initially the troughs were individually designed and constructed, however by the early 1930s, J.B. Phillips, a relative of the Bills, became the head contractor. Working to a standard design he produced the troughs in Auburn Road in Hawthorn. The troughs were pre-cast concrete with a curved pediment with the inscription "Donated by Annis & George Bills Australia". 
Manufacture was subsequently handled by Rocla, who produced troughs to the same design in Victoria and later in Junee in New South Wales. With the rise of motorised transport, demand for the troughs declined and production had ceased by the end of World War II. 
Aside from the horse troughs, the trust was involved with other animal welfare projects including the establishment of the George Bills RSPCA Rescue Centre at Burwood East, Victoria which opened in 1964.

Music of the Command &amp; Conquer series

The music of the "Command & Conquer" series refers to the soundtracks of the Command & Conquer ("C&C" or "CNC") video games, as well as soundtrack and compilation albums. "C&C" is a video game franchise, mostly of the real-time strategy style, developed primarily by Westwood Studios and Electronic Arts. Much of the music for the series was composed and produced by Westwood Studios' former sound director and video game music composer Frank Klepacki for the early games, with composition duties being taken on by several others following the liquidation of Westwood Studios in 2003. Klepacki returned to the series in 2008 however to assist with the soundtrack for "".
Albums.
"Command & Conquer".
"The Music of Command & Conquer" is a soundtrack album containing musical tracks from the video game "Command & Conquer", composed by Frank Klepacki and produced by Westwood. It was originally released in 1995. The soundtrack spans two discs and 22 tracks with combined duration of approximately 72 minutes. The soundtrack was bundled with some of the game's collector's editions, which feature tracks from both the original "Command & Conquer" and the expansion. Though it was never released through retail, Westwood Studios sold this official soundtrack by special order through its website and in game catalogues. The album was packaged with a brushed aluminium design and featuring the official "Command & Conquer" logo. Many songs included in the release of the album include vocals which could previously only be heard on the PlayStation version of the game; these were actually the original versions of the songs. The voice samples in the songs conflicted with the voices in the game, factoring in their removal from the in-game soundtrack.
Some song names differ from the in-game versions. In these cases, the in-game track title is mentioned behind the original title. Also, some track titles differ from the versions on Frank Klepacki's website. In these cases, the website's track titles are mentioned behind the original in-game track title. The first seven in-game tracks are only available with the "The Covert Operations" expansion pack.
The "Command & Conquer" soundtrack is the first video game produced by Westwood to feature streaming music as opposed to MIDI. The 22k mono tracks were produced using an ASR-10 sampler, a Roland S760 sampler and a Roland JD-990 synth module. Klepacki has credited influences from dozens of artists including Peter Gabriel, Pink Floyd and Nine Inch Nails in the production of the soundtrack. Klepacki wrote the songs in batches, each in different musical genres. "In The Line of Fire" was written in an orchestral style while "C&C Thang" was influenced by Hip Hop and metal in "Deception". Certain songs such as "Hold On", in the style of Laurie Anderson, were cut from the game because they did not fit the style Klepacki was aiming for in the overall soundtrack.
With the release of the "Covert Operations" expansion pack Klepacki composed many of the ambient songs of which he was requested by Westwood for the game.
The track "No Mercy" as well as "Deception" feature voice samples of the character Chuck De Nomolos from the film "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey". "In Trouble" contains voice samples of Maverick from "Top Gun" and the track "I Remember Now" from the Queensrÿche album "".
"Command & Conquer: Red Alert".
The game's original score was composed by Frank Klepacki and was voted the best video game soundtrack of 1996 by PC Gamer and Gameslice magazines. Among his most famous songs from the series is the theme of "Red Alert", titled "Hell March", which accents the style of the game with adrenalized riffs of electric guitar, the sounds of marching feet, and synthesizers to a sampled drill command. Originally intended to be the theme for the Brotherhood of Nod faction in the "Covert Operations" expansion to the 1995 "Command & Conquer", the track eventually ended up enlisting itself as a staple in the "Red Alert" series instead.
Following the success of "Hell March", Klepacki headed the composition of its two variations, each becoming the main theme for "" ("Hell March 2/HM2") and "Red Alert 3" ("Hell March 3"), respectively. Recently, the original "Hell March" has been used in the motoring show "Top Gear", particularly during their American Road trip to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Season 12 Episode 2.
When playing the single-player campaign, a limited number of tracks are initially available, and more are unlocked as the player progresses through missions. When playing in a multiplayer or "skirmish" game, however, all tracks are available from the start. More tracks were included in the "Red Alert" expansion packs: "Counterstrike", "The Aftermath" and "Retaliation". The music tracks can be listened to on Frank Klepacki's website.
An official soundtrack was released with unique album art designed by Westwood studios and, like the previous release, featured the official Command & Conquer series logo with the Red Alert series motif below. The album contained all fifteen songs plus a hidden bonus track. Half a minute after the end of track 15 plays an unnamed bonus track. Its melodramatic opening was used in the secret campaign, and the track itself is a tribute to Misirlou, using the rhythm of an earlier "Command & Conquer" music piece, "No Mercy". In the media player on Frank Klepacki's website, the track is titled "Surf No Mercy".
"Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun".
The soundtrack of "" was released in 1999. In addition certain editions of "Tiberian Sun" came with the soundtrack bundled in, such as in the "Platinum Edition" and "Firepower" bundle pack, which also contained the original "Tiberian Sun" and its expansion pack, "Firestorm".
Reception of the soundtrack was mixed as the music departed from the industrial music style of the original "Command & Conquer" in favor of a slow, moody ambient music reflecting the game's apocalyptic setting in a world being ecologically ravaged by Tiberium.
Klepacki had originally started writing the soundtrack in a similar style to the previous titles but, after a meeting with Westwood, it was decided that the soundtrack would be "very dark, moody and not upbeat at all." To help him achieve the desired style Klepacki enlisted the help and "electronic style" of Jarrid Mendelson for the production of songs such as "Dusk hour" and "Flurry" before the two split to write the remainder of the songs in their respective studios.
When the time came to score the music for the Firestorm expansion pack, Klepacki and the producer decided that the music should be more upbeat and a return to the original style of the music of Command & Conquer.
Unlike previous album releases the cover for Tiberian Sun did not feature the classic Command & Conquer series logo but favoured a shadowed style mirroring the ambient musical tone of the album.
"Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2".
"Red Alert 2 Original Soundtrack" is a soundtrack album containing musical tracks from the video game "Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2", composed by Frank Klepacki and produced by Westwood. It was originally released in 2001. The soundtrack spans 16 tracks and has a duration of approximately 63:00.
The title track of the album is a rewritten version of the original "Hell March" from "".
Klepacki defined "Red Alert 2"s style with heavy metal guitar and fast-paced beats. Klepacki scored the game with a Korg Tr-rack, Novation Nova Desktop, and Roland 5080.
The return to high-energy songs was owed in part to fan criticism of "Tiberian Sun". Klepacki maintained the energetic style in "Red Alert 2"'s expansion pack "Yuri's Revenge".
"Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3".
Composer Frank Klepacki returned to write three tracks for the game. When interviewed regarding the matter, Klepacki indicated a strong desire to contribute more, but admitted that due to the fact that he is no longer being employed by Electronic Arts and currently works for Petroglyph Games, this may be contractually impossible. At the "RA3" Community Summit in June 2008, Klepacki showed a video to the entire C&C community in which he stated that he had been hired to work on "Red Alert 3", and that he was composing Hell March 3, the most recent update of "Red Alert"s iconic theme.
In November 2008, Crispy Gamer reported that James Hannigan and Timothy Michael Wynn wrote the bulk of the game's remaining 114 minutes of music, with Hannigan composing the "Soviet March" menu theme along with music for the Empire of the Rising Sun Faction, and Wynn the music of the Allies and the remaining Soviet tracks. Music4Games has also covered the game's music score.
The band From First to Last composed several remix versions of Hell March and Hell March 2, also featured on the Red Alert 3 soundtrack shipped with the Premier Edition.
The expansion pack, Uprising, scored mostly by James Hannigan and Timothy Michael Wynn, introduced a new track called Yuriko's Theme by Hannigan, featuring two singers: Miriam Stockley and Satomi Morimoto. This theme was later remixed by Menno de Jong into a trance version, and it was later played at many great Trance festivals.
Reception and legacy.
Before the release of "Command & Conquer", the majority of video games used MIDI files and other similar formats for music as a way to save space. Westwood was one of the first major developers to include actual audio files in their games. Although these recordings were generally of low quality compared to modern mp3s, many credit Westwood for helping to popularize the concept.

Eupatorium fortunei

Eupatorium fortunei, in Chinese called 佩兰 pei lan, is a plant species in Asteraceae native from Asia where it is rare in the wild but commonly cultivated. The white to reddish colored flowers and herbage smell like lavender when crushed. In China the plants are used to make fragrant oils.
Description.
"Eupatorium fortunei" is herbaceous perennial that grows 40 to 100 centimeters tall, growing from procumbent rhizomes. Plants are upright growing with green stems that are often tinted with reddish or purple dots. The stems have few branches and the inflorescence is apically branched. Cauline foliage is large with short petioles, the 5 to 10 cm long and 1.5 to 2.5 cm wide leaves are 3-sected or 3-partite and the terminal lobe of the leaves is large and narrowly elliptic to elliptic-lanceolate or oblanceolate shaped. The margins of the leaves are toothed, the largest leaves are produced mid stem and the leaves become smaller as they descend down the stems, the bottom leaves wither away by the time flowering begins. The flowers are in capitula, which are numerous and arranged in apical compound corymbs; inflorescence 3 to 10 cm across. The phyllaries are purple-red, they also lack hairs and glands. The florets are white to reddish in color, have 5 cm wide corolla that also lack glands. The elliptically shaped fruits are 5 angled achenes which are black-brown in color and 3-4 mm long. Pappus is white and about 5 mm long. This species flowers and fruits in July through November in China.
In Japanese it is known as fujibakama, a term that is also applied to cultivated "Eupatorium" flowers which have noticeable differences (in leaf shape) from the wild "E. fortunei".
Uses.
The plant is used medicinally in both Japan and China.
In Traditional Chinese Medicine it is indicated for poor appetite, nausea and vomiting due to 'dampness' obstructions or summer heat. Its modern usage includes stomach flus and acute gastritis, in conjunction with other herbs including Huo Xiang (Agastache rugosa).
Toxicity.
"Eupatorium fortunei" contains tumorigenic pyrrolizidine alkaloids.

Philogelos

Philogelos () is the oldest existing collection of jokes.
The collection is written in Greek, and the language used indicates that it may have been written in the 4th century AD, according to William Berg, an American classics professor. It is attributed to Hierokles and Philagrios, about whom little is known. Because the celebration of a thousand years of Rome is mentioned in joke 62, the collection perhaps dates from after that event in 248 CE. Although it is the oldest existing collection of jokes, it is known that it was not the oldest collection, because Athenaeus wrote that Philip II of Macedon paid for a social club in Athens to write down its members' jokes, and at the beginning of the 2nd century BCE, Plautus twice has a character mentioning books of jokes.
The collection contains 265 jokes categorised into subjects such as teachers and scholars, and eggheads and fools.
Modern day.
In 2008, British TV personality and comedian Jim Bowen tested the material on a modern audience. One of the jokes in "Philogelos "has been described as "an ancestor of Monty Python's famous Dead Parrot comedy sketch." Comedian Jimmy Carr has said that some of the jokes are "strikingly similar" to modern ones.

Eupatorium japonicum

Eupatorium japonicum, called in Chinese 白头婆 bai tou po, is a herbaceous plant species in Asteraceae. It is native to China, Japan and Korea.
Description.
"Eupatorium japonicum" is a herbaceous perennial growing 50–200 cm tall from short rhizomes with many fibrous roots. The stems are upright and marked with purplish red, ending with simple or corymbose, (flat) inflorescence that branch near their ends. The leaves are oppositely arranged on the stems and have short but rather thick petioles that are 1–2 cm long. The leaves midway up the stems are elliptic, narrowly elliptic, ovate-elliptic, or lanceolate in shape and 6 to 20 long and 2 to 6.5 cm wide. The leaves are pinnately veined, with lateral veins 7-paired, the undersides of the leaves have prominent veining. The Leaves gradually tapper to a sharp point and the bases are broad or narrow, and the leaf margins are sometimes 3-partite. Before flowering, the basel foliage withers away. The upper leaves of the stems are the same shape but smaller than those below them. The foliage is scabrid, crisped-villous or puberulent with yellow glandular hairs. Leaf margins are coarsely or double-serrate. The flowers are collected together into capitula (heads) that are densely corymbose, the inflorescence are usually 3 to 6 cm wide and rarely form large compound corymbose inflorescence that can be up to 20 cm wide. The involucre are campanulate shaped and 5–6 mm wide, composed of five flowers. The lanceolate shaped phyllaries are imbricate, with 3-seriate edges, the outer phyllaries are very short, only 1–2 mm wide, and green or purple-tinged. The florets are white, red-purple, or pink, with corolla about 5 mm wide and the corolla is covered with yellow glands. The fruits are black-brown, 5-angled, hairless achenes, that are elliptic in shape and about 3.5 mm long, and are covered with yellow glands. The 5 mm long pappus are white. This species blooms and fruits from June to November.

Commonwealth Oil Refineries

Commonwealth Oil Refineries (COR) was an Australian oil company that operated between 1920 and 1952 as a joint venture of the Australian government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The partnership was established in 1920 on the initiative of prime minister Billy Hughes. In 1924 it opened Australia's first oil refinery near Laverton, Victoria, north of the Melbourne - Geelong railway, adjacent to Kororoit Creek Road.
In 1952, the Menzies Coalition government sold the Australian government's interest in COR to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which became the British Petroleum Company (BP) in 1954. Between 1952 and 1959, BP Australia branded its standard-grade petrol as COR, but then dropped the name.

He then attended the University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in Management Science followed by a Master's degree in Financial Engineering.
Career.
Karim's father, Abdoulaye Wade, was elected as President of Senegal in the 2000 presidential election after decades in opposition. In 2002, Karim Wade was named Personal Advisor to the President of the Republic, in charge of implementing major restructuring projects, among which were the New International Airport of Diass, the restructuring of Chemical Industries of Senegal ("Industries Chimiques du Senegal", ICS), and the creation of the special integrated economic zone of Dakar.
In June 2004, Wade was named President of ANOCI, whose mission was to prepare and organize the 11th Islamic Summit. The ANOCI team worked to create a so-called modern transportation infrastructure, rebuilding the "Corniche Ouest", and developing public works such as the Soumbedioune Tunnel and the Northern Corridor Highway exchanges. Critics complained that Wade exceeded his budget as President of ANOCI.
On 26 August 2008, Wade met with French President Nicolas Sarkozy to discuss a project for the installation of a nuclear power station in Senegal. This would ease the problem of electrical power generation which has confronted the country for many years.
2009 Dakar election and ministerial appointment.
Karim Wade ran for office for the first time in the March 2009 local election in Dakar. Although Wade won a seat as a municipal councillor, the opposition won a majority of seats and thus gained control of Dakar's municipal government; the outcome was considered to be a political humiliation for Wade. Souleymane Ndéné Ndiaye was subsequently appointed as Prime Minister, and he met with Karim Wade on 1 May 2009; at that meeting he offered Wade a position in the government, which Wade accepted. Later on the same day, Wade was appointed as Minister of State for International Cooperation, Regional Development ("Aménagement du territoire"), Air Transport, and Infrastructure.
Members of the opposition suggested that Wade and his father had originally planned that he would use local power in Dakar to position himself for the presidential succession, but that the plan had been thwarted due to the opposition's victory in Dakar. Consequently, according to the opposition's speculation, it was decided that Wade would instead be positioned for the succession through control of a key ministry. In the press, Wade's ministry was described as the largest one to ever exist in Senegal since it obtained independence, and Wade was compared to Ali Bongo, son of Gabonese President Omar Bongo, who was also thought to be positioned for the presidential succession through his control of a key ministry. President Wade consistently dismissed claims that he was preparing his son for the succession, describing Karim as an ordinary citizen.
The office building in which Karim Wade worked caught on fire on 1 October 2009 due to an electrical problem, and Wade was rescued from the building by French and Senegalese firefighters. In December 2009, when defending Senegal's construction of a massive "African Renaissance" statue from imam claims that it was "idolatrous", President Wade compared the statue to Christian statues of Jesus Christ. Although he used the comparison to counter the suggestion that the statue was idolatrous, some Christians angrily protested his remarks, and Wade sent Karim to deliver an apology to Theodore Adrien Sarr, the Archbishop of Dakar.
In a government where decision-making was already heavily dominated by President Wade, Karim was given vast responsibilities that far exceeded those assigned to ordinary ministers, and some argued that his portfolio covered 46% of the state's budget. According to President Wade, Karim's vast responsibilities were justified by his exceptional competence. By 2010, with Karim playing a key role in government work, it seemed clear to many Senegalese that he was being prepared for the presidential succession, particularly in light of his father's advanced age (Abdoulaye Wade was 84 years old in 2010). The elder Wade's decision to create the office of Vice-President fuelled rumors that he envisioned it as a mechanism through which to secure his son's succession, although he made no immediate move to appoint Karim (or anyone else) to the newly created post.
Despite the ongoing speculation, in 2010 President Wade still seemed fit and energetic for a man of his age, and he expressed his intention to stand for another term in the 2012 presidential election. Karim himself was observed to be highly deferential towards his father. In the public, there was considerable objection to the notion of a father–son succession, and Karim seemed foreign to many Senegalese, raising the question of whether such a succession would be politically viable.
President Wade expanded his "super-minister" son's already vast responsibilities even further by assigning him the energy portfolio, in addition to his existing portfolios, on 4 October 2010.
Abdoulaye Wade ran for another term as President in the February—March 2012 presidential election; his candidacy was controversial, with the opposition arguing that he had already exhausted the two terms permitted under the constitution. Wade was ultimately defeated by opposition candidate Macky Sall; consequently Karim Wade lost his government post in April 2012, when Sall was sworn in. A year later, on 17 April 2013, Karim Wade was charged with corruption. His lawyers alleged that the case against Wade was politically motivated.
Personal life.
Wade was married to a French citizen, Karine Wade, and had three children with her. She died of an illness in Paris on 10 April 2009.

<doc id="20194671" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20194671" title="Successianus">
Successianus

Successianus was a Roman general of the Third Century AD of whom very little is known for certain. He appears to have distinguished himself at a lower rank, but, when promoted to Praetorian Prefect by Valerian he failed to save his Emperor from defeat and capture by the Persians.
Sources.
What little is known of Successianius comes from the "Historia Nova" of Zozimus and the information is teased out by Prof. A. Alfoldi and by L.L. Howe. This article is based on their accounts.
Origins.
Nothing is known of Successianus's origins or his date of birth. The absence of any evidence as to his "nomen" means that onomastic analysis cannot be applied.
Career.
Successianus is first encountered in as commander of the garrison of Pityus, a city in the Kingdom of Colchis on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in modern Georgia. This region did not lie within the Roman imperial frontier, but it is known that Rome was in a treaty relationship with Colchis and supplied garrisons at key points. During Successianus's watch, Pityus came under attack by the "Borani", one of the peoples who lived in the steppes north of the Crimea known generally as the "Scythae". The "Borani" raid on Pityus was one of the first of the seaborne expeditions by the "Scythae" which were to reach their peak in the 260s. Thanks to Sucessianus's inspired leadership, the city held out and the raiders were forced to retreat after suffering considerable losses.
This rare success by one of his commanders inspired the Emperor Valerian who had recently arrived in Syria to take charge of the war against the Persians to call Successianus to his headquarters in Antioch, where he is said to have assisted the Emperor in rebuilding the city which had been reduced to ruins by King Shapur. He is then supposed to have been made Praetorian Prefect although Zozimus nowhere says this. If he was thus promoted, his authority is likely to have been confined to those provinces under Valerian's direct control – i.e. Asia, Mesopotamia and Syria – while Silvanus may have acted for Gallienus in an equivalent office.
End.
Unfortunately, the qualities that had made Successianus an excellent garrison commander in Pityus were obviously not those he needed as Valerian's Chief-of-General Staff: the Roman defence of the East, torn between the need to fend off Shapur in Mesopotamia and Syria and the "Scythae" in Asia Minor, was generally ineffective. Unable to battle the deadly combination of military defeat and plague military "morale" seems to have collapsed. It is supposed that Successianus was with Valerian, still serving him as Praetorian Prefect when Shapur defeated him and took him captive near Edessa in June(?) 260. It is supposed that, like his Emperor, he died in Persian captivity.
It is impossible to determine whether in Successianus we see a promising officer who had shown sufficient promise to be promoted "praepositus" of the garrison of an allied city, but was then elevated beyond his capabilities, or a soldier of some competence who was unable to get a grip on the situation that prevailed at the headquarters of the Imperial field-army. Some combination of these possibilities is more than likely..

Tank Racer

Tank Racer is a 3D action racing computer and video game by Focus Multimedia Ltd, Grolier Interactive and Glass Ghost, copyrighted in 1998 and released on March 26 1999.
Single Player Mode.
There are 4 tanks to choose from for each championship (12 in total), and 8 different tracks.
The main goal of the single player mode in Tank Racer is to win all 3 cups in Cup Race. There are 4 courses in the bronze cup, 3 Courses And 2 Repeated Courses in the silver cup and 1 courses And 5 Repeated Courses in the gold cup. There are 4 'brands' of tanks to choose from. Though each cup has a different type of a specific brand, they keep the same purpose and more or less the same characteristics.
For example: the EBZ brand is build for handling and taking corners rather than for speed and this remains true for each of the cups. Although there are differences, the 'EBZ 212 coupe' has handling as the highest statistic while the 'EBZ 720 SLi' switched to acceleration, top speed is still their lowest rating.
Each track is different, usually with a main road to follow and some shortcuts to discover. With the premise of racing tanks other interesting options are provided. Cars that block the road are no longer unpassable obstacles, you simply run over them rendering them flattened for the next round. Driving through parts of a houses to quickly cut off a corner and save time becomes standard. These and other possibilities can quickly alter the flow of a race.
Multi Player Mode.
There are two multi-player modes, Battle mode and Multiplayer Race mode
Battle mode:
Battle mode lets you battle against one other player (on the PC version you battle via LAN, the Internet, Modem link or DirectCable and on the PlayStation version you battle using "split screen mode") in 1 of 8 tracks.
Multiplayer Race mode:
With the PC version of the game you play Multiplayer Race mode with up to 5 other players over LAN or the Internet, or with 1 other player via Modem link or DirectCable connection. With the PlayStation version of the game you can play Multiplayer Race mode with 1 other player in "split screen mode".
Multiplayer Rules:
No Hidden Tanks And Goodies Are Allowed Only
Random Powerups Will Dropped On Map
Power-Ups.
There are 9 power-ups throughout the game:
Mobile Phone Version.
A mobile phone version (known as Tank Racer Mobile, Tank Racer Portable and Portable Tank Racer) of the game was released by GlobalFun and Runestone Games on February 28 2005. It is in 2D unlike the PC or PlayStation versions.
In the game you can chose from a range of tanks including "Bumbleboy", "Thor" and "Power Punch". Like the PC and PlayStation versions you have a range of tracks and championships to choose from, and some tracks have hidden shortcuts.
Reception.
The UK Official PlayStation Magazine gave the PlayStation version 6 out of 10, describing the "novelty racing game" as having a "Casanova charm" with a "fun-filled soul".

The Great Wife Hope

"The Great Wife Hope" is the third episode of "The Simpsons"' twenty-first season. Originally broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on October 11, 2009, it sees the men of Springfield taking immense interest in a new combat sport called mixed martial arts (MMA). Marge is appalled by the violent sport and demands that the creator puts a stop to it, but he agrees only if she fights him in a match and wins.
"The Great Wife Hope" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Matthew Faughnan. Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) champion Chuck Liddell guest starred in it as himself. The episode featured multiple cultural references to fighting moves and positions, along with a single reference to professional wrestling promotion owner Vince McMahon. Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews from television critics, particularly towards the final scene. It received a 4.3/7 Nielsen rating with adults ages 18–49, behind all other programs aimed at that demographic in its timeslot.
Plot.
The men of Springfield become obsessed with a violent new string of mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions called "Ultimate Punch Kick and Choke Championships" (UPKCC). Bart begins to fight in small MMA matches of his own at the playground of Springfield Elementary School. While fighting with Nelson in one of these matches, his mother Marge sees him and is disgusted by the violent nature of the entire sport. She and a group of concerned women begin protesting the sport in front of the MMA stadium. Marge decides to go on stage before a match begins and demands that everyone cease the sport entirely. Chet Englebrit, creator of the sport, agrees with Marge but only if she can fight him and win.
Marge begins to train for the event, practicing rhythmic gymnastics. However, the family believes that her methods are unsuitable for the extreme task at hand and get her professional help. She learns boxing from Dredrick Tatum, wrestling from former Yale wrestler Mr. Burns, jujitsu and Judo from Akira, and bullying from Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney. Now fully trained, she enters the ring (after the announcer introduces her as one of "Moms we'd Like to Fight") with Englebrit and is immediately knocked to the ground. Bart wants to stand up for his mother and runs into the stadium to take her place, but is thoroughly thrashed by Englebrit. Marge witnesses this and effectively beats Englebrit, winning their bet. Marge pulls down the ring's microphone and she begins to give a speech about the demise of the violent sport. She realizes, however, that everyone has already left the building to watch a drunken brawl in the parking lot.
Bart and his sister, Lisa, enter the empty ring and decide to settle their lifelong feud then and there. As they approach each other to throw a punch, the credits begin, but the scene immediately returns to depict Lisa easily punching Bart to the ground.
Production and cultural references.
"The Great Wife Hope" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Matthew Faughnan. The writers of "The Simpsons" had a vast amount of knowledge and appreciation for mixed martial arts and included multiple references and themes of the sport throughout the episode. Former Ultimate Fighter champion Chuck Liddell guest starred as himself, signing photographs for fans, including Bart, at a cost of $25. Liddell commented that being a guest star was "very cool" and that the recording sessions were "easy."
The episode is a satire of the combat sport of mixed martial arts. Throughout the episode, characters perform multiple fighting moves and positions. For example, Bart puts Nelson in a triangle choke at the playground when the two are fighting, while Marge takes out Englebrit with a flying armbar. Marge explains in the beginning of the episode that she found out about a creative new sport called "Crazy Bowling" by typing in "girls having fun"—after ignoring several thousand pages of porn—into the search engine Google. Also, H.R. Pufnstuf is parodied as HufnStuf on Ice, because Englebrit's assistant claims the next day, Hufnstuf on Ice will need the space. 
Marge claims that the word "Ultimate" makes everything worse, though Otto Mann protests that it does not affect the popular sport Ultimate Frisbee. Englebrit carries similar traits to the professional wrestling promoter Vince McMahon. Marge initially tries to train for the match by performing rhythmic gymnastics. She practices boxing with a character named Dredrick Tatum, who is a parody of renowned boxer Mike Tyson.
Reception.
"The Great Wife Hope" originally aired in the United States on October 11, 2009, at 8:00 p.m. eastern time on the Fox network. It bore a parental rating of TV-PG for suggestive dialogue (D), offensive language (L), and graphic violence (V). In this initial broadcast, it received a Nielsen rating of 4.3/7, totaling 7.5 million viewers in the 18-19 demographic. The episode ranked the lowest in the 8:00 p.m. timeslot for the demographic, behind "60 Minutes" and "The Amazing Race" on CBS, Sunday Night Football on NBC, "" on ABC, and fellow Fox animated sitcom "The Cleveland Show," which followed it.
The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. IGN reporter Robert Canning gave the episode a 7.7/10 rating ("Good"), commenting that "what really made me enjoy 'The Great Wife Hope' were the peripheral bits, characters and jokes outside the main storyline. There were many, and they were funny." Canning wrote that the weakest part about the episode was the underdevelopment of Englebrit, but that "there were plenty of other things squeezed in around this bout to make the episode an enjoyable watch"—these included Ralph Wiggum being used as a bell for Bart and Nelson's fight, Nelson wanting to be an event planner, and Carl's line about not knowing all African Americans in the world simply because he is one himself.
Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, giving the episode a "B", wrote that it had "some amusing detours along the way." He compared "The Great Wife Hope" positively to season two's "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge," writing that Marge's attempts to bring down the MMA sport is the parallel to her trying to bring "The Itchy & Scratchy Show" off the air due to its severe cartoon violence in the latter episode. The staff of the website MMAjunkie said the episode was a sign that MMA had "truly made it" and fans of the sport could appreciate the writer's knowledge on the topic.
Among more negative reviews include Jason Hughes of TV Squad, who commented that several jokes in the episode did not work, such as the reveal that Krusty the Clown has been sleeping with Sideshow Mel's wife for several years, though he did enjoy the majority of the other jokes and applauded the development of Nelson's character.
Dana White, president of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), told reporters that he did not like the episode. He added, "People like the martial arts media always try to tell me that we're mainstream. [...] Did you see that Simpsons episode? Chuck Liddell signs an autograph for somebody, and he says, 'That will be $45, please'. The sport isn't like that at all. Then the promoter of the show fights Marge Simpson in the octagon, sucker-punches her in the face, and then says, 'You're the only woman I've ever hit that I didn't love'. That's the way mainstream looks at us and thinks of us, and I know that."
The final scene in the episode, featuring Bart and Lisa fighting in the arena, has received overwhelmingly positive remarks from reviewers. Canning wrote that it was "a classic moment for the series [...] This almost felt like a moment that could have closed out the series." Hughes commented that it was "the best moment of the night" as it "would have been a typical ending" if it had not added the twist proceeding the credits. Melissa and Randall Baker of "TV Guide" magazine said that the scene was a moment of "girl power," as Lisa knocks out Bart easily with one punch.

<doc id="20194751" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20194751" title="Morass (set theory)">
Morass (set theory)

In axiomatic set theory, a mathematical discipline, a morass is an infinite combinatorial structure, used to create "large" structures from a "small" number of "small" approximations. They were invented by Ronald Jensen in his proof that cardinal transfer theorems hold under the axiom of constructibility.
Overview.
Whilst it is possible to define so-called gap-"n" morasses for "n" > 1, they are so complex that focus is usually restricted to the gap-1 case, except for specific applications. The "gap" is essentially the cardinal difference between the size of the "small approximations" used and the size of the ultimate structure.
A (gap-1) morass on an uncountable regular cardinal κ consists of a tree of height κ + 1, with the top level having κ+-many nodes. The nodes are taken to be ordinals, and functions π between these ordinals are associated to the edges in the tree order. It is required that the ordinal structure of the top level nodes be "built up" as the direct limit of the ordinals in the branch to that node by the maps π, so the lower level nodes can be thought of as approximations to the (larger) top level node. 
A long list of further axioms is imposed to have this happen in a particularly "nice" way.
Variants and equivalents.
Velleman and 
Shelah and Stanley independently developed forcing axioms equivalent to the existence of morasses, to facilitate their use by non-experts. Going further, Velleman showed that the existence of morasses is equivalent to simplified morasses, which are vastly simpler structures. However, the only known construction of a simplified morass in Gödel's constructible universe is by means of morasses, so the original notion retains interest.
Other variants on morasses, generally with added structure, have also appeared over the years. These include "universal morasses," whereby every subset of κ is built up through the branches of the morass, and "mangroves," which are morasses stratified into levels ("mangals") at which every branch must have a node.

Peter Kitchen

Michael Peter Kitchen (born 16 February 1952 in Mexborough) is an English-born former professional footballer who played in the Football League in the 1970s and 80's as a forward.
Career.
Kitchen began his career at Doncaster Rovers, after being spotted by manager Lawrie McMenemy, and he went on to spend seven years there as a first team player. He made his debut at the age of 18 and scored after just two minutes during a 3–0 win over Shrewsbury Town and scored again in his second game, a 2–1 defeat to Swansea Town. Despite Doncaster struggling in Division Four for several years, Kitchen made a name for himself at Rovers, forming striking partnerships with Brendan O'Callaghan and Mike Elwiss. He played alongside Elwiss in one of the biggest games for the club at the time when they drew 2–2 with Liverpool at Anfield on 5 January 1974, with Kitchen scoring one of the goals, before losing 2–0 in the replay. Kitchen went on to attract attention from higher divisions for several years, including spending time on trial at Bobby Robson's Ipswich Town, before signing for Leyton Orient in the summer of 1977 for £40,000.
Ever present in his first year at Orient he finished as the club's top scorer with 21 goals, as well as scoring seven times in the FA Cup as the club reached the semi-finals beating Chelsea and Middlesbrough along the way. The following year he moved across London to join Fulham for a fee of £150,000. The move did not work out for him as he struggled to find form and a series of injuries in his second year at Fulham saw him miss most of the season as the club were relegated and he moved to Cardiff City for £100,000.
He made his debut for Cardiff in a 4–2 win against one of his former clubs in Leyton Orient and, although he didn't score in that game, he ended the season as the club's top scorer with 13 League goals and, mainly thanks to scoring 5 times in a 6–0 win over Cardiff Corinthians in the Welsh Cup, 19 goals in all competitions as Cardiff just avoided relegation. However his form at the club did not continue into his second season at Ninian Park as the club failed to avoid relegation for the second year running and fell to Division Three.
After leaving Cardiff he had a short spell with Hong Kong side Happy Valley, before returning to play for Leyton Orient in 1982–83. He made another 49 league appearances in his second spell with the London club, and then went to play Major Indoor Soccer League football with Las Vegas Americans. He returned to play for Dagenham in non-league football, then finished his Football League career with a short stint at Chester City in 1984–85 before returning to Dagenham for the remainder of that season before being released.
Kitchen retired at the age of 33, though made a short come back for Margate in 1991 and during the 1990s made 228 appearances for Corinthian Casuals Veterans, scoring 280 goals.
His post-football career included coaching on the youth development programme at Wimbledon F.C., and as of September 2006 he was working at a leisure management company in Sevenoaks, retiring by 2010 to spend time travelling.

Louis Charles Salvana (20 January 1897 – 8 December 1974) was an Australian sportsman who played first-class cricket for Victoria and Australian rules football with Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He was known during his football career by his first name Lou and by Charles when he played cricket.
Salvana spent the 1919 VFL season with Melbourne and made six appearances for their seniors that year, all in losses. The Prahran recruit kicked two goals in a game against Carlton at the MCG. 
He didn't play again after that year and instead turned his attention to cricket, appearing in his first and only first-class cricket match in the 1926/27 summer. The match, a Sheffield Shield encounter against New South Wales, took place at the Sydney Cricket Ground. New South Wales batted first and amassed 469, on the back of an unbeaten 217 by Alan Kippax. Salvana didn't bowl but contributed with a catch to dismiss Test player Johnny Taylor. A right-handed batsman, Salvana opened the batting in each of Victoria's innings and made scores of six and a duck. In the second innings he was dismissed by Charlie Macartney, an Australian representative.

Miriam Odemba (born 1983) (from Arusha, Tanzania) is Miss Tanzania Earth 2008 and Miss Earth Air 2008 (first runner up). Odemba is a Tanzanian model. She is one of the best models from her country where she started her modeling career at an early age and emerged into the limelight in 1997 when she won the Miss Temeke title. The following year she took part in the Miss East Africa beauty pageant and finished second.
At 13, her life was tough and her parents had to move to their uncle. She always wondered what life was all about then. As she grew older, she perceived God’s message of love and started appreciating everything around her especially the nature, God’s greatest gift to not only to her but to all of us.
Miss Earth 2008.
In the final competition of the eighth edition of the international beauty pageant Miss Earth, Odemba was announced as one of sixteen semi-finalists who would move forward to compete for the title. She achieved one of the eight highest scores in the swimsuit competition for her stage chops, which advanced her as one of the top eight finalists to participate in the evening gown competition. She then pulled away for the lead as she articulated in her video interview about environmental concerns as a key issue in her country, in which she advanced to the top four.
In the last round, the court of four were asked one question, “What would you tell US president-elect Barack Obama about the state of the global environment if ever you were to meet him?” She placed the second highest score in the interview round and at the conclusion of the competition, she was crowned Miss Earth Air.
Odemba also won Miss Aficionado, a minor award. Other winners include: Miss Philippines Karla Paula Henry as Miss Earth 2008, Miss Mexico Abigail Elizalde as Miss Earth-Water (second runner-up), Miss Brazil Tatiane Alves as Miss Earth-Fire (third runner-up). Miriam returned home on November 24 to her country, Tanzania. Maria, her national director and whose company named Odemba as the country’s envoy to the Miss Earth global pageant, welcomed her and prepared a tumultuous homecoming with a parade and press conference for winning Miss Earth Air 2008. The Miss Earth pageant was held on November 9, 2008 at the Clark Expo Amphitheater in Angeles City, Pampanga, Philippines. Eighty-five delegates arrived from October 19, 2008 in the Philippines. The pageant was broadcast live via ABS-CBN in the Philippines and to many countries worldwide via Star World, The Filipino Channel and other partner networks.
Odemba's closest friend among the Miss Earth 2008 top four runner-up winners—named after the four elements—is her pageant roommate Karla Henry, Miss Earth 2008 from the Philippines. They plan to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in the near future.<ref name=times-weekend/20081116week1.html/>

Sam Richards (writer)

Sam Richards (born 1949; London), is an English writer, composer, improviser, jazz pianist and former folk music collector and performer. For most of his life he has lived in south Devon. His father was the writer and playwright Allen Saddler (1923-2011).
After studying with Alfred Nieman at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama he moved to Devon and quickly became involved in the performance and collection of folk music, accumulating some 500 hours of recordings from traditional performers. In the late 1980s his interest turned to avant-garde and experimental music, and he has written a number of pieces in that genre. He taught at Dartington College of Arts and now teaches at the University of Plymouth
His writings include the books "The Engaged Musician", "John Cage as..." and "Sonic Harvest: Towards Musical Democracy"; BBC Radios 2 and 3 documentaries including one on the composer Morton Feldman; and articles for "Oral History", the "Folk Music Journal", "fRoots", "Contemporary Music Review", "Proof", "The Wire" and the "New Statesman". An article about the experiments involving music and landscape appeared in the online journal The Clearing. http://theclearingonline.org/2013/10/the-musical-landscapes-of-sam-richards/
Early studies and folk music.
Richards cites formative influences as Alfred Nieman and Cornelius Cardew. He studied with Nieman at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. In 1968 he moved from the Guildhall to Dartington College of Arts in Devon. He had already studied composition at Dartington Summer School of Music with French avant gardist Michel Decoust.
In the 1970s he was a member of the folk trio Staverton Bridge with Tish Stubbs and Paul Wilson, and later toured the English folk scene as a duo with Tish Stubbs. He devoted much time to folklore research mainly in England's Westcountry, concentrating on gypsies, farming communities and children's songs and tales, writing several papers on these subjects. A number of sound recordings made by him and of him performing are held by the British Library Sound Archive, and the Sam Richards Folklore Archive of 500 hours of recordings of song, music and interviews made between 1972-1987 is held by the University of Plymouth. In 1979 he and Tish Stubbs published "The English Folksinger", a collection of folk songs with melodies; it includes a few songs which Richards wrote himself. At this time he was director of the Westcountry Folklore Centre and co-director of People's Stage Tapes, which concentrated on releasing recordings of traditional and revival performers, including a recording of Walter Pardon singing at a folk club in Torquay. From 1982 to at least 1989 he jointly produced with Steve Roud a quarterly newsletter titled "Folk Song Research: A Newsletter for Researchers of Traditional Song".
Avant garde and jazz.
After some years specialising in musical anthropology and fieldwork, Richards wrote "Fool's Holiday", a quasi-minimalist score with much opportunity for jazz improvisation. In collaboration with Peter Kiddle of "Theatre of Public Works" this became a theatre/dance piece with references to ritual and folklore.
His recent premières include "Kropotkin", a large scale piece for many performers, which was performed on 1 March 2009 as part of the Peninsula Arts Contemporary Music Festival, and "Four Sea Studies" - premièred by the Torbay Symphony Orchestra in 2010. His "Four Drones" was commissioned in 2009 by the Experimental Flute Ensemble and played in various venues around South Devon. Premièred in June, 2009, was his "About Time: Voices" at the San Francisco Public Library, performed by the Cornelius Cardew Choir.
Fish Music.
"Fish Music" was an idea conceived when Richards was a student. Fish swimming in a tank become musical notation by means of a five line musical stave being placed across the glass. String players are instructed to choose a fish and follow its course behind the stave. A revised version in which a team of improvisers with backs turned to the fish respond to the string sound, was premièred by the strings of Ten Tors Orchestra at the National Marine Aquarium, Plymouth in 2008. The earlier version had no improvisers, but had a pre-recorded soundtrack instead. This was the version filmed by Long Room Productions for their hour-long documentary about Richards entitled "Sonic Harvest". An updated version for filmed fish, string players and improvising soloists was presented in Plymouth city centre in the summer of 2013, using the city's large outdoor screen for the film of the fish.
Dismissal from Dartington.
From 2006, Richards was an outspoken opponent of the proposed closure and move to Falmouth of Dartington College of Arts, the last small independent arts college in the UK, where he had taught part-time for 30 years. He was a founder member of the "Save Dartington College Campaign" which existed not only to save the college, but to question the processes and interests which led to its closure. Richards said that "the whole ethos of Dartington can’t and won’t be transplanted down there. Once you have taken it away from the place where it grew from, it will become something else."
He was suspended from the college over a satirical article he published on the campaign website that criticized the college administration and, in particular, principal Andrew Brewerton. Following a hearing, he was dismissed for gross insubordination, a decision that he appealed against, maintaining that it was unfair and biased against him. The appeal tribunal agreed that if Richards apologised to Brewerton he could be reinstated, giving guidelines as to what the apology should contain. However, the apology he wrote was not accepted by Brewerton and Richards refused to compromise further.
Current activities.
Richards has worked part-time at the University of Plymouth since the early 1990s. He lectures in music, and is a member of Peninsula Arts Contemporary Music Group which organises the Peninsula Arts Contemporary Music Festival. He is also one of four organisers of Totnes Music Now. In 2012 he became a member of the Board of Soundart Radio, a community FM radio station for the Totnes area. In November 2012 he became Chair of Soundart's Board. He is also an improviser and jazz pianist.

Richard P. Havens, 1983

Richard P. Havens, 1983 is a 1969 double album set by folk rock musician Richie Havens featuring a combination of studio recordings and live material recorded in concert in July, 1968. The album combined original material with several of the covers for which Havens is known. Notable songs include "Handsome Johnny" and the singles "Stop Pushing and Pulling Me" and "Indian Rope Man", the latter of which has been multiply covered under its own name and in retooled identity as "African Herbsman." The genre-bending album was critically and commercially well-received, reaching #80 on the Billboard "Pop Albums" chart. Initially released on the Verve label, it has been reissued multiple times in various formats, including by Verve subsidiary Verve Forecast Records, PolyGram and Australian label Raven Records. It has also been compiled with albums "Mixed Bag" and "Something Else Again" in multi-cd set "" on the Hip-O Select label.
Background.
"Richard P. Havens, 1983" compiles a number of studio tracks with live material recorded for a concert in July 1968. Musically, it displays Havens' multi-instrumental approach and demonstrates the influence of several genres, including folk rock, world music and folk blues. As critic Richie Unterberger described it in 2003's "Eight Miles High", the album "worked towards a folk-rock-world-music fusion of sorts, though one grounded in the sort of bluesy folk ...and others had pioneered in the Village back in the early 60s." Producer Elliott Mazer said that Havens' method of playing presented some difficulties to the many musicians who joined him, as "Richie was not very interested in learning the chords for the songs" but "made up his own". 
Described as a concept album, this was Havens' first experience co-producing one of his albums. Additional production on the album was provided by Mazer and Mark Roth, while John Court lent production to the song "Indian Rope Man." For the cover, Roth photographed Havens in infrared.
Music and reception.
The album was commercially successful, reaching #80 on the Billboard "Pop Albums" chart, and critically well received. 2004's "Rip It Up: The Black Experience in Rock'n'Roll" indicates that this album, along with Havens' "Mixed Bag" and "Alarm Clock", "should be considered staples of the "rock" canon." "The Rough Guide to Rock" praises it as "an excellent mix of originals and covers, with a darker, brooding feel." In a more modest assessment, Unterberger's review in Allmusic summarizes, "As with many double albums, it perhaps could have used some pruning, although in general it was a worthy expansion of his sound as captured on record."
Notable songs on the album include "Handsome Johnny", which is among Havens' best known songs. Havens and actor Lou Gossett, Jr. had written the tune for 1967's "Mixed Bag", and it would become a standard by the time he notably updated it during his 1969 performance at Woodstock. 
The album also includes several of the covers for which Havens is known, particularly the "imaginative covers" of Beatles and Bob Dylan which Unterberger indicated "he was able to recast as his own". However, while "Rough Guide" suggested that the album bears "witness to Havens' compelling ability as a live performer", Unterberger discerned on this particular recording "an over reliance on Beatles covers" and felt "the live stuff on side four...seems like an afterthought to push the set to double-LP length."
Singles released from the album include "Stop Pulling and Pushing Me", the B side of a cover of "Rocky Raccoon", in July 1969, and "Indian Rope Man", which was released twice in May 1969: as an "A" side with "Just Above My Hobby Horses Head" and a "B" side with Beatles' cover "Lady Madonna." "Indian Rope Man" has proved enduring, with multiple covers by Brian Auger, Julie Driscoll and Phaze, among others. It was also retooled and retitled as "African Herbsman", under which title it was performed by Bob Marley.
Track listing.
"Except where otherwise noted, all tracks composed by Richie Havens."
Releases.
The album was initially released on vinyl in 1969 on Verve Forecast Records. It was re-released as a compact disk in 1990 on Polygram. In 2004, "Richard P. Havens, 1983" was combined with two other Havens albums on a Hip-O Select double CD titled "Flyin' Bird: The Verve Forecast Years".

Career.
Booth was born in Middleton, Lancashire, and joined Wolverhampton Wanderers as an apprentice in 1950. He made his first-team debut on 11 April 1955 in a 1–0 win over Aston Villa, one of three appearances that season. He began to establish himself in the following season, as he scored 7 times in 27 outings, before adding 9 goals in just 20 games in the subsequent season. However, he found himself below the likes of Jimmy Murray, Dennis Wilshaw and Bobby Mason in the Wolves attack and managed only a peripheral role in their championship-winning campaign of 1957-58. The next season saw him similarly on the sidelines but he did manage an impressive 7 goals from just 13 games. Booth scored four goals against Arsenal on 10 November 1956, in a 5–2 victory for Wolves – this is still a record against the Gunners, shared with Billy Walker of Aston Villa who also scored four in 1920. He won an England Under 23 cap in 1956 against France, coming on as a substitute for future team mate Alick Jeffrey, who broke his leg.
In search of regular football, he joined Nottingham Forest in October 1959. He scored 41 goals in 98 appearances in total for Forest during two-and-a-half seasons, his best season coming in 1960-61 where he netted 19 times. He then spent two seasons at Doncaster Rovers before joining Oxford United. He ended his career at non-league Cambridge United before leaving the game and working in healthcare.

List of one-eyed creatures in mythology and fiction

This page lists one-eyed creatures in mythology and fiction.
In mythology, this trait was generally associated with fearsome creatures. In modern fiction, some one-eyed creatures are likewise frightening enemies, but others are friendly.
The list includes peoples and mutants born with only one eye, but not one-eyed humans who are understood to have lost an eye.

Thomas Bird (sportsman)

Thomas "Tommy" Robert Bird (31 August 1904 – 12 April 1979) was an Australian sportsman who played first-class cricket for Victoria and Australian rules football with Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL). 
Thomas played nine games and kicked five goals for Collingwood over two VFL seasons. He debuted at Collingwood in 1925, a year when Collingwood reached the Grand Final for the first of six successive seasons. As a result of the Magpies side being so strong, Bird struggled to make the team and after his two games in 1925 didn't make another appearance with the seniors until 1928. In a premiership year for Collingwood, Thomas played seven games, including one against Carlton at Princes Park where he kicked three goals in a thrilling win. He however missed out on selection again for the finals series.
On the cricket field Bird was a right-handed wicket-keeper batsman and played three first-class matches for Victoria in the summer of 1928/29. His debut match, against New South Wales, was his finest as he scored 63 from position eight in the batting order to help Victoria secure a draw in their second innings. The match, which took place at the Sydney Cricket Ground, is remembered for Don Bradman's innings of 340 not out, his maiden first-class triple hundred.

Boris Schwanwitsch

Boris Nikolayevich Schwanwitsch (or Schwanwitz), , (1889, Poltava – 1957) was a Russian entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera. He is best known for his studies of the colour pattern of the wings.
Boris Schwanwitz graduated from the St. Petersburg University (1908–1913). After graduation he changed a number of academic positions: assistant lecturer in Entomology at the Stebut Agricultural School (1915), assistant lecturer (1919) and private-docent (1926) at Petrograd (Leningrad) University, professor at the Perm University (1928–1930). In 1930, he returned to Leningrad (St. Petersburg) to take the position of the head of Entomology department of the Leningrad University (1930–1931 and 1944–1955, 1930 to 1944 the dept. for Entomology was part of the Invertebrate Zoology dept.) Vice-president of the Entomological Society of USSR (1954–1957) and the chair of the Zoology section of the Leningrad Naturalists Society.
In a series of papers he reconstructed the groundplan of the colour-pattern of the wings, first for the Rhopalocera, then for Heteroceran families. He formulated the stereomorphism principle, according to which the cryptic effect of the colour pattern is a result of its 'flattening' (the three-dimensional objects look flat) or 'disjunctive' effect (the two-dimensional objects look like a complex three-dimensional relief). To prove his point he built the plaster three-dimensional models of the lepidopteran wings, the photographs of which looked like an actual colour pattern of stripes and shades (photos were published in a series of papers and in his textbook in entomology). Among his other important contributions are a textbook in entomology with a large morphology section heavily based on Snodgrass and Weber (1949, still in use in Russian Universities), and a book on practical apiculture (1945).
His gravestone is ornamented with a reproduction of the groundplan of the colour-pattern of lepidopteran wings from his textbook.
