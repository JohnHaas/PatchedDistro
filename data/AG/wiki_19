Sagami Trough

The also Sagami Trench, Sagami Megathrust, or Sagami Subduction Zone is a 210-mile long trough, which is the surface expression of the convergent plate boundary where the Philippine Sea Plate is being subducted under the North American Plate. The Sagami Trough megathrust generated the 1703 Genroku earthquake, which was the greatest rupture along the trough in the last thousand years, and the 1855 (Ansei) and 1923 (Great Kanto or Taisho) earthquakes. It stretches from the Boso Triple Junction where it meets the Japan Trench to Sagami Bay, where it meets the Nankai Trough. It runs north of the Izu Islands chain and the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc (IBM). Earthquakes associated with the Sagami Trough are a threat to Tokyo and the Kanto Region because of the proximity to a population center (with over 36 million living in Tokyo's metro area, with a total of 43 million living in the Kanto Region) and the magnitude the Sagami Trough can create.

Balzer Jacobsen

Balzer Jacobsen, was Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands from 1655 to 1661.
Balzer Jacobsen was Danish, and was put in place by King Frederik III against the will of the Faroese Lagting. Jacobsen was first and foremost one of Christoffer Gabel's men, who was vogt of the Faroe Islands. Gabel also had a monopoly on trade to and from the islands during this period. In 1661 Jógvan Poulsen regained control as Prime Minister and Jacobsen withdrew to Denmark, but the real power in the Faroe Islands still lay with the land owners. This period of Faroese history is known in Faroese as "Gablatíðin", and was difficult due to the trade monopoly and wishes from Copenhagen about the crown's absolute control of the fiefdom.

RNC 8

The RNC 8 are eight members of the RNC Welcoming Committee who were arrested and charged with a felony under Minnesota terrorism law with "Conspiracy to riot in furtherance of terrorism."
On August 30, 2008, two days before the Republican National Convention was held, the Ramsey County Sheriff's Department raided three homes and arrested five activists, Monica Bicking, Garrett Fitzgerald, Erik Oseland, Nathanael Secor, and Eryn Trimmer. Later that day, Luce Guillen-Givins was arrested leaving a public meeting at a park. The remaining two activists, Rob Czernik and Max Specktor, were arrested on September 1, the first day of the protests surrounding the RNC convention.
The eight activists were originally charged under the Minnesota version of the USA PATRIOT Act with "conspiracy to riot in the second degree in furtherance of terrorism." On April 8, 2009, Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner announced that the terrorism charges, which carried enhanced penalties, would be dropped. The eight co-defendants were charged with two felony counts: conspiracy to riot and conspiracy to commit property damage.
Police alleged the eight planned to kidnap RNC delegates, assault officers and raid the Xcel Energy Center. The Minnesota chapter of the National Lawyers Guild has criticized the prosecution for relying too heavily on informants rather than physical evidence.
On August 27, 2010, Erik Oseland accepted a plea deal with prosecutors. In court, he pleaded guilty and will serve 90 days in a county workhouse and pay a $100 fine on the condition that he will not be compelled to testify against the remaining seven members of the RNC 8 when they go to trial in October 2010.
On September 16, 2010, Ramsey County prosecutors dismissed felony charges against three defendants — Monica Bicking, Luce Guillen-Givins, and Eryn Trimmer. The RNC 8 case concluded on October 19, 2010, when the remaining four defendants accepted a gross misdemeanor plea agreement carrying no jail time.

<doc id="20200910" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20200910" title="Das Echo">
Das Echo

Das Echo is a monthly German language newspaper based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
"Das Echo" began as the "Das Echo des Deutschen Hauses für die deutsch-kanadische Gemeinschaft", founded by Paul Christian Walter in 1978. It first began printing as a trimestrial newssheet for the German community in Greater Montreal. Like the majority of newspapers in Germany, it is a subscriber's publication with a comparable small number of freely sold issues. Das Echo is the only newspaper by an ethnic minority (German) in Canada to have stringers in most Canadian provinces and many European countries.
Since its foundation, Das Echo faced the delocalisation of its readers from Montreal and the rest of Quebec to other Canadian provinces. Like their English speaking neighbours, many German speaking Quebeckers left the province because of the political turmoil and changes that followed the Quiet Revolution. In 1979 Walter turned the news sheet into a bimonthly newspaper and two years later it became a monthly newspaper, reporting about the activities of and covering information for the German-speaking communities in the Canadian provinces. In 1982 the title was finally shortened to "Das Echo" featuring the subtitle "von Küste zu Küste", meaning "from coast to coast". 
From 1984 to 1995 "Das Echo" experienced a period of extensive growth, exceeding a circulation of 80,000. Das Echo has usually been an ethnic press newspaper, but established itself as an independent source of information in central European affairs in North America. Many readers consider it as the German Canadian voice. Since the mid 90s Das Echo has earned a steadily growing number of subscriptions from the United States.
A strong loss of subscriptions during the late 90s and early years of the new millennium left a harsh impact on the newspaper and forced the Walter family into restructuring to avoid a financial collapse. The dramatically reduced subscription base led to a pursuit for more advertising in the newspaper in order to keep a low retail price. On the other hand the editorial staff was required to reorient the central theme of traditional German Canadian affairs, to reinforce its distinguishing character as German Canadian newspaper. 
As late as 2006 Das Echo started recovering subscription numbers. The newspaper currently has an average monthly readership of about 100,000. Even facing a stark decline in circulation (compared to top sales in the mid-90s), it is still the largest nationwide German language newspaper in Canada and the United States. Its largest regional readership can be found in the Canadian prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In 2012 Das Echo received the award of the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada.
Das Echo is member of the globally active IMH network, the International Association of German Media (IDM), the National Ethnic Press & Media Council of Canada, dpa, APA, SDA and swissinfo.

Nicomachus Flavianus (son)

Nicomachus Flavianus ("floruit" 382–432), sometimes referred to as Flavianus the Younger, was a grammarian and a politician of the Roman Empire. He was the son of Virius Nicomachus Flavianus. He held several offices under emperors Valentinian II (371–392), Theodosius I (379–395), Honorius I (393–423), and Valentinian III (425–455); together with his father he supported the usurper Eugenius until his defeat and death (392–394). Flavianus also edited a corrected version of Livy's work.
Biography.
Flavianus belonged to the "Nicomachi", an influential family of senatorial rank. His father was the pagan politician and historian Virius Nicomachus Flavianus, and had a brother. He married Galla, daughter of Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, from which received several letters and whose family had a long-time friendship and alliance with the "Nicomachi"; it was probably in occasion of Flavianus' wedding that the "Nicomachorum-Symmachorum" diptych was produced. As tradition for his family, he was patron of Naples, and, sharing a common interest in his family, he edited works of pagan authors of the Roman literature: in particular, around 408 he produced a corrected edition the first ten books of the "Ab Urbe condita" of Livy, while he was staying near Enna (he had estates in Sicily). His edition had been corrected by Victorinus before him, then bought by Symmachus, and finally, after Flavianus' edition, emended another time by his nephew Appius Nicomachus Dexter; all of the manuscripts of the first ten books of Livy's "Ab Urbe condita" that were subsequently copied through the Middle Ages into modern times are derived by this single manuscript, thanks to whom those books have survived.
His political career is reported on an inscription (CIL, VI, 1783). His first office was "consularis Campaniae", that is governor of the region of Campania, a position held at a date unknown, but before the following office, the one of "proconsul Asiae" (382–383), governor of Asia Minor. His father delayed his departure for his province; in this office he was the addressee of some laws later included in the "Codex Theodosianus", while Himerius dedicated in his honour three orations. He clubbed a decurion, and for this reason was dismissed from his office, taking a ship to go home. He was later recalled at court by Theodosius I, when the emperor was in Italy (389/391), but he did not receive any office.
After the death of Valentinian II, Eugenius usurped the throne of the Western part of the empire; both father and son sided with the usurper, and Flavianus "iunior" became "praefectus urbi" of Rome. After the defeat and death of Eugenius at the battle of the Frigidus (September 394), Flavianus "senior" committed suicide, while Flavianus "iunior" received no harm from his support to the usurper, apart having to repay his father's wages as praetorian prefect. He received several letters from his father-in-law Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, a close and influential friend of his father, to suggest him to take part to the senatorial delegation to the emperor (397), in order to rehabilitate himself, but it is probable he did not follow Symmachus' suggestions. However he was invited in late 398 to the celebrations for the inauguration of the Emperor as consul for 399.
He was twice appointed "praefectus urbi" of Rome, first between 399–400 and then again in 408. The total number of prefectures was officially two, as the office held under Eugenius was not recognized, but one inscription refers vaguely to the number of terms, and on his edition of Livius' work there is a note referring to three prefectures. In 414 was sent in Africa together with Caecilianus to investigate a matter.
In 431–432 was praetorian prefect of Italia, Illyricum and Africa.

Belly River Ranger Station Historic District

The Belly River Ranger Station Historic District in Glacier National Park includes several historic structures, including the original ranger station, now used as a barn. The rustic log structures were built beginning in 1912. Other buildings include a woodshed, built in 1927 to standard National Park Service plans and a cabin used as a fire cache.
The ranger station building is similar to those at Sherburne and Upper Lake McDonald, with the ranger's office and quarters downstairs and space for guests in the loft. The station is one of the oldest locations, established in 1912 and staffed by District Ranger Joe Cosley. It remains the only ranger station in Glacier which cannot be accessed by road. The present barn was the original 1912 ranger station.
The woodshed is a standard National Park Service design, built according to standard drawing G811. Woodsheds were an essential element of early ranger stations, providing shelter from the snow for work and storage. The fire cache, which is ised to house fire-fighting tools, was built in 1928 and used for accommodations for a time, then converted to fire cache use. It is substantially similar to the Kintla Lake fire cache. 
There is no utility power at Belly River. Propane is used for heat, cooking and refrigeration.

It gave the Secretary of Agriculture the power to set hunting seasons nationwide, making it the first U.S. law ever passed to regulate the shooting of migratory birds. It became effective on 4 March 1913 but, because of a constitutional weakness, was later replaced by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

Use Somebody

"Use Somebody" is a song by the American alternative rock group Kings of Leon. It was the second single from the band's fourth studio album "Only by the Night" (2008), released on December 8, 2008.
The single received heavy airplay in Scandinavia, the Republic of Ireland, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia, where it was number one on the Official Airplay Chart for six consecutive weeks. It was a huge success in the U.S., where it topped multiple airplay formats and reached number four on the Hot 100 and number one on the Pop Songs chart. The song received positive reviews and won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Rock Song and was also nominated for Song of the Year.
Critical reception.
The song has received generally positive reviews from music critics. Mikael Wood of "Entertainment Weekly" called "Use Somebody" a highlight of the album, describing the song as "a too-cool hipster's cry for comfort".
Nick Levine of Digital Spy said, "With its Springsteen-style 'oooah-woooah's, gathering storm of guitars and lusty, longing vocals from Caleb Followill, it's nearly as infectious as 'Sex on Fire'."
Gavin Haynes of "NME" praised the song as "easily the best 80s power ballad of 2008", but cautioned that the band "may be in danger of mistaking bluster for brilliance".
Chart performance.
In the United States, "Use Somebody" became the band's mainstream breakthrough. Peaking at number four on the Hot 100, it gave the band their first top five hit there, and has spent 57 weeks on the chart. On U.S. radio, the song was a multi-format smash, becoming just the fourth song in history to top the Mainstream Top 40, Adult Top 40, Alternative Songs, and Triple A charts. (Preceding it were "Slide" by the Goo Goo Dolls, "Every Morning" by Sugar Ray, and "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" by Green Day.) The song first reached number one on the "Billboard" Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart (now called the "Alternative" chart), their second of three consecutive singles to top that chart. "Use Somebody" also reached number one on the Adult Top 40 Chart, and later topped the Mainstream Top 40 as well. As of July 2013, it had sold over 4,068,000 units in the US.
In the UK, "Use Somebody" peaked at #2 on the official UK Top 75 and spent an unbroken 40 weeks on the chart, only dropping out due to the surge in sales of Michael Jackson titles immediately after his death; after an absence of just one week it was back for another 20 weeks, peaking at #25. It has reappeared on further occasions since, and has now spent 65 weeks on the Top 75, making it the 8th longest runner of all time, and 86 weeks in the Top 100.

Resident welfare association

A Resident Welfare Association (frequently abbreviated as RWA) is a civic body that represents the interests of the residents of a specific urban or suburban locality in Indian cities. Membership is voluntary, and the leadership is usually elected by fee-paying members. RWAs are not official organs of government, and even slums and illegal housing localities in India can form RWAs to represent citizen interests. RWAs are typically registered through co-operative societies acts, which require groups to have a minimum of fifteen members from a given area. These acts also set the rules for the establishment of RWA bye-laws, which include such things as membership criteria, voting rights, and the conditions under which RWA officers can initiate legal proceeding on behalf of the registered society. Despite the prevalence of RWAs in slums and unauthorized colonies, however, government programs aimed at involving RWAs in strategic governance decisions, such as Delhi's Bhagidari Scheme, include only RWAs based in planned neighborhoods. RWAs have become increasingly involved in municipal politics and decision-making since the early 2000s and continue to grow in importance.

The Grassroot Deviation

The Grassroot Deviation is an Edmonton-based four-piece musical group that plays a mixture of roots, rock and funk. The band formed in 2002 and consists of guitarists/vocalists Brian Parker and Dan Smith, bassist/fiddler Mike Barer and drummer Vinay Jhass. The band has played more than 100 shows across Canada and released two studio albums, "The Grassroot Deviation" and "The Circuit". All the band members have either graduated or currently attend the University of Alberta.
History.
The Grassroot Deviation are influenced by Emmylou Harris, Bruce Cockburn and Neil Young. Their work includes instrumental jam sessions, such as the Celtic infused "Mr. Somebody", mid tempo folk ballads like "Steady Ground" and the funk infused "Regular People", which features 12-bar blues, call and response and funky bass and drums. Front man Brian Parker states, "I think when you combine the writing of folk songs with that dancey, groove-inspired kinda thing, you end up with what we do." The band have played on the same bill as acts such as Keller Williams, That One Guy, Wide Mouth Mason, Wasabi Collective, Slowcoaster, Captain Tractor, Hey Ocean, and Five Alarm Funk.
Defending their liking for instrumentals, Brian Parker said "are definitely important...Sometimes lyrics are necessary, sometimes they’re not...If you're writing a song and you want to convey a certain emotion or idea...lyrics are one route and music provides another.".
The second album, "The Circuit", is more rooted in their jam session style, which maintains the energy and enthusiasm of their live performances. Parker explains, "We went into the studio and banged it out. It was very speedy, but I'm happy with that sound. That was sort of the concept of the album - 'Let's just do what we do.' We get the most response from our shows. The shows are what we do, so why would we try to change that?" During 2007, the band toured Canada, beginning with Victoria, British Columbia and ending in Antigonish, Nova Scotia.
In November 2008, The Grassroot Deviation performed in front of 250 fans at "The Digital Universe", a laser light show complemented by Canada's only full dome digital projection system in the Margaret Zeidler Star Theatre at TELUS World of Science, Edmonton. The visuals were coordinated to the bands set which was composed largely of jams.

Albert Jaegers

Albert Jaegers (March 28, 1868 – July 22, 1925) was an American sculptor.
Life.
Jaegers was born on March 28, 1868, in Elberfeld, Germany. He moved with his family to Cincinnati, Ohio, as a boy. He apprenticed to his father as a wood carver, then studied at the Cincinnati Art Academy, and later in London, Paris, and Rome.
In 1890, he married Matilda Holdt and launched his career as a sculptor. He won competitions sponsored by the National Sculpture Society.
He exhibited at the Pan-American Exposition (1901) and Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904). For the latter he was commissioned to create the statue representing Arkansas.
In 1906 he won the commission for the Steuben Monument in Washington, D.C. on the basis of the endorsement of his work at an early stage of the competition by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. His bronze sculptures included an eleven-foot high figure of the military leader set atop a granite pedestal almost 20 feet high. Alongside the pedestal are two groups. In the one called "Commemoration", a seated female figure, unclothed above the waist, represents America instructing a small child from a scroll he holds up to her as he kneels at her feet. In the other, "Military Instruction", a seated adult soldier, naked but for an elaborate helmet, "in the prime of life", holds an empty scabbard in one hand. With his other hand, as if providing instruction, he points to his unsheathed sword, held by the naked young man at his side.
When the U.S. government selected sculptors to create figures for the U.S. Custom House in New York City, each of which was to represent an historic seafaring powers, Jaegers won the commission to create the one for Germany, which he planned as "an armed female figure, leaning on an antique shield, inscribed 'Kiel'". Following the U.S. declaration of war on Germany in 1917, Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo asked him to modify it to represent Belgium, a U.S. ally in World War I. Jaegers refused to alter it, but the sculpture was modified over his objections. He said his work could not be seriously modified with "a little camouflage with a relabel" and called the change of name "a somewhat dubious honor for plucky little Belgium".
His sculptures of German-American historical figures were sometimes targeted when the U.S. and Germany were at war. The dedication of his figure of Monsignor Anthony Stein met with protest and threats of violence. The dedication of his statue of Francis Daniel Pastorius, the founder of Germantown, Pennsylvania, was delayed until after the end of World War I and it was later removed from view during World War II.
In 1918 he contributed a small sculpture call "The Grenade Thrower" to a show of patriotic and war-related pieces.
Jaegers was a member of the National Sculpture Society and the National Institute of Arts and Letters. He was the brother of sculptor Augustine Jaegers (1878 - 1952), whose career paralleled his.
He lived on Washington Square Park in New York City.
He died from heart disease on July 22, 1925 in Suffern, New York, and was buried at Airmont Cemetery, there.

Willie Mount

Willie Landry Mount (born August 25, 1949) is an American politician from Louisiana who served as a Democratic member of the Louisiana State Senate from 2000 to 2012. She represented District 27, which includes parts of Lake Charles and the surrounding cities of Sulphur and Westlake. From 1993 to 1999, Mount was the first female to have served as the mayor of Lake Charles.
Mount was a candidate in the 2004 U.S. House of Representatives election for Louisiana's 7th congressional district. She was defeated by Republican Charles Boustany in a contested general election campaign that received national attention. 
Personal life.
Born and reared in Lake Charles, Mount in 1974 obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from McNeese State University in Lake Charles. She owned a small business and worked as a real estate agent and pharmaceutical representative for Lederle Laboratories. Mount resides in her hometown with her husband, attorney Benjamin Mount; they have no children.
Career.
Mount had been active in community work, through organizations such as the Junior League of Lake Charles, and ran for mayor of Lake Charles in 1993, winning against Paul Savoie, a Democrat and a former mayor. During her tenure she served as president of the Louisiana Conference of Mayors and supported restoration efforts following hurricanes. To this end Mount testified before Congress in support of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. She also co-sponsored the building of an Amtrak station, modeled after an older station that had been destroyed in a fire. In an effort to succeed retiring state senator James J. Cox, Mount announced her senate candidacy on October 19, 1999, while addressing the Calcasieu Parish School Board, which she asked to support her. Upon being elected, Mount resigned as mayor and City Council President Rodney Geyen took over the office.
In the senate, Mount served on a variety of committees, chairing the Senate Committees on Coastal Restoration and Flood Control, Revenue and Fiscal Affairs, and also serving as Vice-Chair of the Senate Committee on Education. In 2008, she became chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare. Mount often sponsors legislation regarding health and public service. This includes bills intended to identify sex offenders and enact term limits for various boards and commissions. She was responsible for passing these term limits as an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution, as SB 232 on November 4, 2008. Mount also sponsored legislation to merge New Orleans criminal and civil district courts, create a childhood and family learning center, couple the opening of new hospice care providers with inspections of existing ones, allow police to suspend driver's licenses of teenagers with problems at school, and create a state-run internet database providing information on the quality of health care providers. Mount was responsible for legislation that made Louisiana water fluoridation mandatory, and, in her capacity as chair of the Senate Health committee, Mount in 2008 declared major Louisiana health care reform unlikely without prior federal reform.
As senator, Mount raised funds for health care facilities (Mount had herself roasted in support of the Southwest Louisiana Center for Health Services). Mount is a member of a number of boards and charitable organisations and provides an annual compilation of "Louisiana positives" about Louisiana's standing in national ratings. Due to term limits, Mount was eligible to serve as senator until 2012.
2004 Congressional race.
Mount ran for Congress in 2004 to succeed Chris John, who had announced his retirement from the U.S. House of Representatives to run for the U.S. Senate. She positioned herself as a conservative Democrat, supportive of balanced budgets and conservative social views, emphasizing job creation, health care and her opposition to offshoring. Her major Democratic opponent in the jungle primary was African American State Senator Don Cravins, Sr., the father of another lawmaker, Don Cravins, Jr., of Opelousas. Her major Republican opponent was Charles Boustany, a retired heart surgeon from Lafayette, who ran on a platform of preventing tax increases and passing a new energy bill. The Louisiana Democratic Party was supporting Mount, as Cravins was believed to be a weaker contestant in a run-off. Polls taken in late October had shown Boustany, Cravins and Mount statistically tied and the election was hotly contested.
In the first ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount garnered the most votes; Cravins was defeated by less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favouring tax cuts for the rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount also criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as removed from the interests of voters. She received endorsements by U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.
In the general election on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush in the presidential election in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent. Following her defeat, Mount ruled out another campaign for the seat, but not a campaign for another state-wide office.
When Mount left the Senate in 2012, she was succeeded by a Republican, former State Representative Ronnie Johns of Sulphur, who ran unopposed for the open seat.
Campaign for tax assessor.
In 2011, Mount announced her candidacy for tax assessor of Calcasieu Parish. She received 13,477 votes (38.3 percent) in the primary held on October 22 and promptly withdrew from the November 19 general election. Victory hence went to the acting assessor, Wendy Curphy 
Aguillard, an Independent who led the primary balloting with 17,208 votes (48.9 percent). A third candidate, Republican Mike Regan, was also eliminated in the primary, having received the remaining 4,538 votes (12.9 percent).

Autism's False Prophets

"Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure" is a 2008 book by Paul Offit, a vaccine expert and chief of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The book focuses on the controversy surrounding the now discredited link between vaccines and autism.
Summary.
Offit describes the origins and development of claims regarding the MMR vaccine and the vaccine preservative thiomersal, as well as subsequent scientific evidence which has disproved a link with autism. The book discusses possible explanations for the persistence of these claims in the face of scientific evidence to the contrary, as well as the proliferation of potentially risky and unproven treatments for autism. The author takes a critical view of several advocates of a vaccine–autism link, including Andrew Wakefield, David Kirby, Mark Geier, and Boyd Haley, raising scientific and, in some cases, ethical and legal concerns. The book also explores divisions within the autism community on the topic of vaccines, as some parents consider the ongoing narrow focus on vaccines a distraction from more scientifically promising avenues of research. In this vein, Offit interviews Kathleen Seidel, a mother of an autistic child who has published investigations critical of those who profit from promoting vaccine–autism claims.
Offit also touches on the heated and bitter debate surrounding vaccine claims. He describes receiving death threats, hate mail, and threats against his children as a result of his advocacy for vaccine safety. Offit declined to do a book tour for "Autism's False Prophets", citing concerns about his physical safety and comparing the intensity of hatred and threats directed at him to that experienced by abortion providers. Author's royalties from the book are being donated to the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
Reception.
The book was the nucleus of profiles of Offit in "Newsweek" and "The Philadelphia Inquirer". The "New York Post" reviewed the book positively, concluding: "Although arguably the most courageous and most knowledgeable scientist about vaccines in the United States, Offit lives in fear for his life and that of his family." "The Wall Street Journal" also praised the book as "an invaluable chronicle that relates some of the many ways in which the vulnerabilities of anxious parents have been exploited."
"The Philadelphia Inquirer" wrote that the book "names names and calls nonsense nonsense", and provides "important insight into the fatal flaws of the key arguments of vaccine alarmists." The "Inquirer" applauded Offit's focus on slanted and sensationalist media coverage of the vaccine–autism issue, but faulted Offit for not holding scientists themselves sufficiently accountable for their failure to communicate the facts to the public.
The "Rocky Mountain News" noted that the book "turned the tables" on those who see a pharmaceutical-industry conspiracy behind vaccination, by pointing out that the advocates of the autism–vaccine link receive large sums of money from lawyers and lobbyists. The "News" applauded the book's deconstruction of "misinformation" from Don Imus, Jenny McCarthy, Joseph Lieberman, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., among others, but found Offit's "sarcasm and brow-beating of those he disagrees with" to be "grating".
"Salon" reviewed the book as an "enlightening, highly readable, and ... timely" work which "deconstruct the anti-vaccine movement as one driven by bad science, litigious greed, hype and ego." "Salon" faulted Offit for minimizing the work that autism advocacy groups have done to raise awareness, create support networks, and obtain research funding; the review noted that Offit focuses instead on aggressive and scientifically "slanted" groups like Defeat Autism Now! and Generation Rescue. The review concluded that the book "effectively pulls back the curtain on the anti-vaccine movement to reveal a crusade grounded less in fact and more in greed and opportunism".
"Science" called the book "forceful" and "an easy-to-read medical thriller about the consequences of greed, hubris, and intellectual sloppiness." The review noted that Offit did not discuss the irrationality of human decision-making in the presence of relative risk and both anecdotal and empirical evidence, and mentioned that Offit did not carefully discuss the role of regression. In conclusion, the review observed that the book has emboldened the media to apply scientific principles, and called for using the book's momentum to shift resources from the autism–vaccination debate to research into causes and treatments.
The "Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders" said the book "makes an important contribution to popular debates about the etiology and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. The book is arguably the most detailed and thorough history available of the current anti-vaccine movement". The review noted one possible weakness: the book gives light coverage to the public's fundamental misunderstanding of the epidemiology of autism, in that the public fears an "autism epidemic" that may not in fact be occurring. The review concluded with a call to scientists and physicians to follow Offit's lead in communicating to the public even uncomfortable truths about autism.
Four months after its release, the "New York Times" reported that the book had been endorsed widely by pediatricians, autism researchers, vaccine companies, and medical journalists, and was "galvanizing a backlash against the antivaccine movement in the United States." Many doctors are critical of "false equivalence" in media coverage of the vaccine issue, and now argue that reporters should treat the antivaccine lobby with the same level of indifference as AIDS denialism and other fringe theories.
Later in 2009, the "New England Journal of Medicine" reported that the book effectively advocated for vaccines and refuted the vaccine–autism myth. It noted that a particular strength of the book is its outline of the scientific method and the basic principles of probability and causality, and its coverage of the difficulty of explaining science to the public, such as the difference between causality and coincidence. It noted as a weakness the book's several diversions into topics such as breast implants.
Other largely favorable reviews appeared in "BioScience", in "Health Affairs", and in the "Journal of Child Neurology".

No Word from Gurb

No Word from Gurb (original in Spanish "Sin noticias de Gurb") was written by Spanish writer Eduardo Mendoza and published as a novel in 1990. However, it originally appeared in the Spanish national newspaper El País in regular installments.
The story is about an alien who is lost in Barcelona whilst in search of his friend Gurb. Through taking on the appearances of various people, including the famous Spanish singer Marta Sánchez, he explores the city observing human life. The book is in the style of a diary, so the reader is taken day by day along the same journey with the alien, as he discovers more and more about the human race.
The story begins with the narrator talking about his ideas and aims of travelling to Earth and adapting to the lifestyle there. Through writing this book, Mendoza captures an image of Barcelona as it is preparing for the Olympics in 1992. The atmosphere at that time, along with the chaos and absurdities of modern human life, are among the subjects that are focused on in this satirical novel. As a parody, "No Word from Gurb" depicts the day to day life of the city from the perspective of an alien. The author focuses in particular on portraying the urban lifestyle of humans; using Barcelona as a great example of a big city. Parody is a feature that is present throughout the book, an example of which is when the alien describes the composition of water as "hydrogen, oxygen and poo."
Throughout his search for his friend Gurb, the alien criticises the behaviour of human beings and realises that there are many differences between his culture and that of humans. For example, although he doesn't understand why, he notes that there are class divisions on Earth: there are rich and poor areas of Barcelona, like San Cosme and Pedralbes. Furthermore, he criticises the chaos regarding the upcoming Olympic Games at the time. In reality, there was a lot of public criticism due to the reported lack of organisation when planning and preparing for the international event. Mendoza again describes the disorganisation of the city as a parody.
Translations of the novel are available in English, French, German, Italian, Danish, Romanian, Polish and Bulgarian.

The Shocker is the debut album by rapper Silkk the Shocker, who was then known as Silkk. It was released on August 20, 1996 for No Limit Records and was mainly produced by Beats By the Pound. "The Shocker" was only a mild success compared to some his future albums and made it to #49 on the Billboard 200 and #6 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. As with most of No Limit's albums, this featured a lot of guest appearances from members of the record label including his brothers, Master P and C-Murder. Planning of this album dates as far back as early 1995, as advertisements for the album can be seen on the back cover of earlier copies of Master P's 1995 album "99 Ways to Die".
Controversy.
Before the album was released, the initial cover for the album had Silkk holding a 9 mm caliber outside of a TV. This is possibly why the "Parental Advisory" logo was moved to the middle of the cover.

They are tasked to destroy human resources, tanks, artillery, anti-tank weapons, aircraft, air defense and other important installations operations.
"On the eve of the professional holiday, the 19th rocket brigade, which is stationed in Khmelnytskyi city, conducted the main examination of the year - the final test for 2010-2011. All servicemen passed a final exams for professional, military and physical training. The history of the brigade began in 1943 at Stalingrad by establishing the 7th Artillery brigade of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. During the Great Patriotic War 27 soldiers, sergeants and officers of the division were nominated for the award "Hero of the Soviet Union". After the declaration of Ukrainian independence and choice of the non-nuclear status, servicemen swore allegiance to people of Ukraine. In November 1997, the division gained the status of a brigade and until 2004 it was subordinated to the 1st Rocket Division of the Ukrainian Ground Forces. For the last 8 years, the brigade is directly subordinated to the command of the land forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, armed with the "Tochka" missile. is the only rocket military unit in the Armed Forces of Ukraine."
Previously the 1st Rocket Division was active at Khmelnytskyi, formed on the basis of the disbanding headquarters of the Soviet 43rd Rocket Army. It was seemingly formed in 1998. At least two brigades were part of the division, the 19th at Khmelnytskyi and the 107th at Kremenchug. The division was disbanded in 2004. (Vad777)

Robert Philp (missionary)

The Reverend Robert Anderson Philp (25 February 1913 – 1 March 2008) was a Church of Scotland missionary in Kenya and acted as interpreter during the trial of Jomo Kenyatta in 1952.
Early life.
Robert Anderson Philp, born on 25 February 1913, was the only child of a Scottish missionary doctor, the Rev Dr Horace Philp, founder of Tumutumu Hospital near Nyeri, Kenya in the foothills of Mount Kenya. He was raised amongst the Kikuyu people of central Kenya, and was known for his mastery of their complex language as well as for the authenticity of his accent.
Education.
After his formative years, he went to George Watson's School in Edinburgh, Scotland and went to study Divinity at Edinburgh University, after which he spent a year studying at the Budapest College of the Reformed Church in Hungary.
Ministry in Kenya.
In 1937 he returned to Kenya as a missionary, where his first station was at his birthplace Tumutumu. While there, he lived and worked as a missionary and also served as a chaplain in the British Army throughout World War II. In 1946 he married Jeane Caddick whom he had met while a student at Edinburgh University and after returning to Kenya set up home at Tumutumu. 
He was well known for his love and identification with, the Kikuyu people of Kenya. During the Mau Mau insurgency, many of the Kikuyu who refused to take the Mau Mau oath were in danger of being killed. Philp successfully acted as a mediator on behalf of some of the Kikuyu to the British authorities. 
Philp taught at St Paul's United Theological College at Limuru, where he was active in preparing and equipping Africans to become ministers He later became the first Church of Scotland missionary at Nakuru in the Great Rift Valley, and then worked at Thogoto, a village near Nairobi. He was well regarded for his work in encouraging close partnerships with his African colleagues, and was tireless in his efforts to foster good relations between Kenyans and Europeans.
Kenyatta trial.
In 1952 while serving as a missionary in Kenya he acted as interpreter during the trial of Jomo Kenyatta. Kenyatta was charged with "managing and being a member" of Mau Mau, the insurgency rebellion against British rule in Kenya. Although he knew English well, Kenyatta determined to speak only in his native language, Kikuyu. The role of court translator was initially given to the archaeologist Louis Leakey, but due to challenges to his translation, Leakey resigned and was replaced by Philp. After a guilty verdict was rendered in April 1953, Kenyatta received a sentence of seven years' hard labour and he remained in prison until 1959.
Later ministry in the United Kingdom.
After 23 years as a second-generation missionary, personal circumstances caused Philp reluctantly to resign in 1960, from the Church of Scotland Mission and leave Kenya. Philp became a Church of Scotland minister at Stepps, Scotland near Glasgow. And due to his vibrant witness, several of his congregation became missionaries or ministers. Philp retired in 1981, at the age 69. He and his wife lived in Leeds, England where they became involved with a Congregational church, and later in Bath, where they became part of an Anglican church community. 
In 1988 the Presbyterian Church of East Africa celebrated the 90th anniversary of the first Scottish missionaries' arrival in Kenya, and requested Philp to attend as guest of honour. While there, he returned to his birthplace, Tumutumu, and he discovered that he had retained his fluency in Kikuyu after 28 years in Britain.
The Presbyterian Church of East Africa's service of celebration at Thogoto was attended by more than 5,000 people, including President Daniel Arap Moi, and in his speech, as Philp spoke in Kikuyu, without notes, the attendees broke into spontaneous applause.
Last days.
After the passing of his wife in 2005, he lived out his last days at Bybrook Nursing Home near Bath, but he always had a love for Kenya, and it was his Kikuyu Bible that he chose to read, rather than an English one. Robert and Jeane had three daughters, Mary, Joan and Dorothy.
Robert Philp died on 1 March 2008. His funeral service was held at All Saint's Church, Weston, England, on 18 March 2008 and his ashes were buried in Kenya, among the Kikuyu people, because, as he once said, "after all, that is where I am from."

<doc id="20201486" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20201486" title="St. Étienne Mle 1907">
St. Étienne Mle 1907

The French St. Étienne Mle 1907 () was a gas operated air-cooled machine gun in 8mm Lebel which was widely used in the early years of the First World War. It was not derived from the Hotchkiss machine-gun, as often repeated erroneously. It was instead a gas operated blow-forward design borrowed from the semi-automatic Bang rifle of 1903. The Bang system was transposed in 1905 to the French Puteaux APX Machine Gun which soon proved to be unsatisfactory. Then, two years later, the Mle 1907 "St-Etienne" machine gun followed as an improved redesign of the "Puteaux" machine gun. However the Mle 1907 "Saint Etienne" was only a partial redesign : the original blow-forward gas piston, rack-and-pinion system and bolt mechanism of the Mle 1905 " Puteaux" machine gun had all been kept only slightly modified inside the newer weapon . Eventually a total of over 39,000 "St-Etienne" Mle 1907 machine guns were manufactured between 1908 and late 1917. They were widely used by French infantry during the early part of WW-1 until their replacement by the simpler and more reliable Hotchkiss M1914 machine-gun.
History.
Around the turn of the century the French military evaluated machine guns made by the private French firm of Hotchkiss et Cie. While the tests were technically convincing, following which Hotchkiss machine-guns were purchased for French alpine and colonial troops, it was decided for political reasons that a machine gun for French line infantry had to originate from state-owned arms manufactures. A first attempt by a French government arsenal near Paris (APX) was the Puteaux M1905 machine gun inspired by the first gas actuated blow forward Bang rifle system of 1903. It was a deliberate attempt to develop an infantry machine gun that would be mechanically different from the patented Hotchkiss Mle 1900 machine gun design. However the M1905 Puteaux machine gun soon proved to be unsatisfactory. Consequently, the national arsenal at Saint Étienne (MAS) thoroughly reworked and modified the Puteaux machine gun resulting in some measure of improvement but also increased complexity—64 component parts for the St Etienne Mle 1907 vs only 32 parts for the Hotchkiss Mle 1914. Barrel changes on the Mle 1907 St Etienne were much easier than on the M1905 Puteaux and its firing rate could be set at any point between 8 rounds per minute and about 600 rounds per minute. Either metal strips or fabric belts, the latter introduced in 1916, for the 8mm Lebel ammunition could be used.
George Chinn notes about the 1907 model that: "While it was gas actuated by means of a piston, the French reversed the conventional principle. Instead of the piston thrust rearward furnishing the source of energy to operate the piece, the gas propels the piston forward to unlock the bolt. The piston is attached by a spring-loaded rod to a gear rack. This in turn engages a spur gear which is fastened to an actuating lever. When the lever is in the forward horizontal position and engages a cam slot in the bolt, the gun is locked. Upon firing, the gas drives the piston forward, compressing the spring and causing the spur gear to rotate clockwise. The actuating lever turns with the gear for a half revolution, retracting the bolt and stopping at the rear horizontal position. The driving spring then forces the piston rearward, which reverses the action and returns the bolt to battery."
Nevertheless, in the muddy environment of trench warfare the mechanically complex St Étienne Mle 1907 suffered from frequent stoppages and was difficult to maintain by front-line soldiers. A quote from a French post-war military evaluation says it all: "admirable weapon, patented clockwork but very delicate and sparing its whims only for the machine-gun virtuosos". The Mle 1907 St Etienne had to be taken away from the front lines, beginning in July 1917, and progressively replaced by the simpler and much more reliable Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. Large numbers of the M1907 St Etienne machine gun were then transferred to military units in the rear, to the French colonies and also to the Italian Army. Many also ended up in the Greek Army during the 1920s. Altogether 39,700 Mle 1907 St Etienne machine guns had been manufactured when the decision to close down their last assembly line was taken in November 1917.

449th Fighter Interceptor Squadron

The 449th Fighter Interceptor Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last assignment was with 11th Air Division stationed at Ladd Air Force Base, Alaska. It was inactivated on 25 August 1960.
History.
Organized in China and fought in the CBI, 1943–1945. Reactivated as part of Alaskan Air Command in 1947 and equipped with P-61 Black Widow Night Fighters, used as interceptors against Soviet Aircraft intruding into North American airspace. 
Former Heisman Trophy-winner Tom Harmon was a member of the unit during their stint in the CBI.
Reequipped with F-82 Twin Mustangs in 1948, receiving additional aircraft from Far East Air Forces after model withdrawn from the Korean War. Modified to the F-82H model with the addition of cold weather equipment and additional de-icers. Many of these fighters operated with Strategic Air Command where they served as escorts for the massive Convair B-36 Peacemaker bomber during long flights over the Arctic.
The 449th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was the last USAF unit equipped with the F-82, retiring the model in 1953 when a lack of parts made it impossible to keep the aging airframes flying. The retirement of the F-82 marked the end of front-line use of USAF propeller driven fighter aircraft. Many were ultimately scrapped in Alaska.
Reassigned to Ladd AFB in 1949 and reequipped with jet F-94 Starfires in 1952. Maintained air defense of Alaska until being inactivated in 1960 along with turnover of Ladd AFB to the United States Army as part of Fort Wainwright.

Bill Dauterive

Bill Dauterive , born 1953 William Fontaine de la Tour D'Haute Rive (French for "William Fountain of the Tower of the High Bank") is a fictional character on the Fox animated series "King of the Hill". He is the Hills' overweight, divorced, and clinically depressed neighbor, voiced by Stephen Root and named for series producer Jim Dauterive.
Production.
Root used his background in Southern theater to help him develop the voice of Bill. Root attended the University Of Florida, and had performed in Southern plays in New York City prior to being chosen for the role. He originally auditioned for the role of Dale Gribble, which "didn't feel right" so he then auditioned for Bill.
Personality.
Bill is indicated as coming from an upper-class Cajun family in Louisiana, who lived on a vast estate called the Chateau D'Haute Rive ("castle on the high bank") until his cousin Gilbert is forced to sell it. He speaks fluent Cajun French and plays the accordion skillfully, which surprises him just as much as it does everyone else. His father was abusive, spanking him regularly, locking him in a rabbit hutch and making him wear dresses. (Bill attempts to justify these actions when he mentions them.) As of the second season episode "The Final Shinsult," Bill's father is presumably still alive (though slowing down in his later years), based upon Bill's remark to Hank that his father "can't even load a hunting rifle anymore," with Bill further commenting that he has to "practically put it in his hands and pull the trigger." By the time of the fourth season episode "A Beer Can Named Desire," Bill's only living male relative is his dandified cousin Gilbert, who still lives in Louisiana. By the eleventh season, the two are guardians of the family's secret barbecue sauce recipe, which Gilbert refuses to allow Bill to sell. (However, Bill eventually gives the recipe to Bobby Hill so he can pass it on to his children, thus keeping the Dauterive tradition alive).
Although overweight, balding, and emotionally needy in his later years, Bill was a muscular, confident athlete with long flowing hair in his youth. Nicknamed the "Billdozer", he held Arlen High's career touchdown record until a young athlete named Ricky Suggs broke it years later. Ricky, however, is simply allowed to score the record-breaking touchdown by the other team due to a torn ACL, rather than playing injured as Bill would have; to regain his honor Bill rejoins the team to score one last touchdown and re-tie the record (he had redshirt eligibility due to being drafted to the Army during his senior year). Bill's bright future was derailed when he attended a Molly Hatchet concert and found his future wife Lenore passed out in his lap; she would go on to cheat on and humiliate Bill before finally leaving him a broken shell of his former self. Although there appear to be several factors, it can generally be assumed that her leaving him was the major cause of his downward spiral. In the episode "Order of the Straight Arrow," Bill says "I'm so depressed, I can't even blink", upon the reminiscence of his childhood days as an Arrow Scout and remembering his wishes to be a free spirited pilot like his father. Bill's negative self-concept is clearly displayed in the episode "A Firefighting We Will Go;" Bill, Dale, Hank, and Boomhaur recall an evening's events, and, while the other three characters imagine themselves in a positive light, Bill imagines himself as being balder, fatter, and more of a glutton than he is in reality.
Bill is often a foil for his friends, who verbally and emotionally put him down on a regular basis, either because they don't realize how hurtful their remarks are or because Bill is too dimwitted to mind very much. He is the first person to be mentioned when any character refers to losers or bemoans a misfortune for fear their lives will be ruined, like his. For example, Hank, while telling Peggy that a lawn makes a man and gives him a purpose, says "Without my lawn, I am Bill," which disgusts Peggy as the thought of being with Bill nauseates her to no end. Bill, like Dale Gribble and Boomhauer, has a strong admiration for Hank and often seeks his advice before doing anything, and for his help when in trouble. He occasionally gets dragged into Dale's crazy schemes, and often is the one who accidentally ruins them. Of all his acquaintances, Boomhauer seems to be the one who gives him the most respect, possibly due to the fact that Bill once helped a brokenhearted Boomhauer get over a girl who dumped him. Dale is the one who seems to disrespect him the most, often insulting his misfortune and lifestyle. Bill has an obsessive crush on Peggy, and frequently makes bumbling, inappropriate remarks about her. Although Bill always speaks highly of Peggy and looks to her as the epitome of desire, she looks at him in total contrast—speaking of him as absolute zero.
Although Bill's friends are often disgusted or frustrated at his stupidity and the number of times he has wrecked their plans, they were devastated when it appeared that he had sacrificed himself to save them when they were stuck on a military target zone, with Hank saying that he was a good friend - sweet, loyal, and brave. During their high school years as they have one last blowout in Bill's honor as he's being shipped off a drunken Hank stirs up a fight with a thug at a bar, but Bill intervenes and saves Hank. On some occasions, Bill will fight back, and relentlessly, if pushed enough; upon the words of a fraudulent and condescending doctor who would sarcastically and falsely told him he would lose his legs from diabetes shortly after diagnosis, and had toyed with Bill's social life and the friends he made along the way, he would exact a beating on him, alongside Hank. 
When examining Bill's Army medical history, Dale discovered that Bill was unknowingly made part in an experiment called "Operation: Infinite Walrus", to create a hybrid soldier capable of operating in freezing cold waters. It is assumed that the experimental drugs are the cause of his weight gain, excessive body hair, baldness, and terrible body odor and breath until it's revealed that he was in the experimental group given a placebo. Bill is also shown to have a severe but easily treatable foot fungus, which actually comes in handy once to help Hank get revenge on a fraudulent mold inspector. Bill was diagnosed with diabetes and was told he would lose his ability to walk, but then later this was contradicted by the inept diagnosing doctor, who says that he only said Bill was "likely" to lose ability to walk from diabetes. Originally the doctor made it seem like Bill would ultimately need to use a wheelchair. (Later, Bill beats him up for this, with Hank standing guard.) Ironically, this "diagnosis" leads Bill to a depressed slump, where he meets Thunder, a wheelchair-using muscle man who plays a wheelchair-friendly version of Rugby. This then leads Bill to get into better shape while playing the sport and this "cured" his diabetes. 
Bill's personal hygiene and other habits are shown to be very poor. As previously mentioned he has severe foot fungus, terrible breath and body odor (when opening the hatch of a tank Bill had stolen, Hank believed there was a dead animal inside due to the smell). Various comments indicate that he doesn't shower or brush his teeth on a regular basis. Bobby states that he has dandruff in spite of being bald. He is regularly shown eating food he finds in or under his couch, and has even been shown to eat food without dishes (as in one episode where he was cooking himself spaghetti, where he broke his only plate and was forced to eat the spaghetti off of his counter and drink the jar of sauce he was going to serve with it). He dumps garbage directly out his kitchen window despite having a garbage can. He has been shown to fall asleep while eating snacks, which attracts animals into his bedroom, though he seems incredulous or apathetic to this. His bathroom is described as disgusting, when asked if they would rather endure a dangerous and painful stunt (ex. stick a wasp up your nose) or shower in Bill's bathroom, his friends always choose the former. When assigned tasks to get his house ready for a family reunion after Nancy and Peggy are assigned the bathroom, both are horrified and desperately try to change assignments. He also has a foot fetish, finding Peggy's unnaturally over-sized feet very appealing, and even tries to take her discarded full-body cast as she convalesces following a disastrous skydive.
Romantic relationships.
Bill Dauterive's ex-wife was named Lenore, who was seen and voiced in the episode "Hank and the Great Glass Elevator", attempting to worm her way back into Bill's life when he became high profile while dating former Texas governor Ann Richards. During the early seasons, he often pined for Lenore to return after she ran out on him, but he was somewhat successful in getting over her in the episode "Pretty Pretty Dresses" after Hank resorts to pretending to be Lenore. Bill then finally symbolically confronts Lenore for leaving him, and after being told "I don't love you anymore" he becomes enraged and yells "You don't deserve William Fontaine De la Tour Dauterive!". During "Hank and the Great Glass Elevator", Lenore tries ordering Bill around in front of Ann Richards but he finally tells her off by mooning her. Other relationships include Luanne's mother Leanne Platter ("Leanne's Saga"), which ended when she reverted to her drunken violent ways and stole his truck, and Kahn's mother Laoma Souphanousinphone ("Maid in Arlen"), which was broken up by interference from Kahn, who convinced Bill that his mother was in love with astronaut Harrison Schmitt, but they then found out Kahn had been lying because seeing the two of them together disgusted him, and reunited with Kahn grudgingly saying they seemed right together (the show originally intended for Bill and Laoma to remain together, but the writing staff changed that plan and simply wrote her out of the series so Bill could remain hilariously unlucky in love). He also had a brief, mostly sexual, relationship with two of his cousins' widows ("A Beer Can Named Desire"). In the episode "The Untitled Blake McCormick Project," Bill dates a woman named Charlene, and she even moves in with him, however Charlene's past with John Redcorn complicates matters. In a later season, he dated Reverend Karen Stroup for a time and even moved her in with him. When Reverend Stroup and Bill began dating, her congregation showed massive disapproval of their Reverend dating anyone, especially Bill. This meant that they had to carry out their relationship in secret. To Bill, this was exciting. He enjoyed the fact that they were having a relationship that was viewed as immoral by their peers. Unfortunately for Bill, when the pressure became too much for Stroup, she stepped down from her Reverendcy so that they could date like normal people. Bill ultimately broke up with Stroup because he found the relationship was no longer exciting when it was not a secret. Due to his ability to keep going after virtually any rejection, Bill is the one able to snap Boomhauer out of his depression when rejected by a woman he truly had feelings for.
Work and personality.
Bill holds the fictional military occupational specialty, barber in the United States Army under Ft. Blanda's H company, 10th infantry. His rank has been revealed through dialogue, in scenes of him wearing obsolete olive drab fatigues as being sergeant, and he appears to wear the insignia of E-5 on his Class A uniform in the episode "Old Glory". He has never deployed in his Army career. He briefly served as a recruiter when his position was eliminated for being wasteful, but it was secretly restored when Hank donated a new chair, with a cover job as an electrician. He speaks four to six languages (English, French, and Tagalog for sure), of which he used at least four in the army. It is revealed in one episode that as an athletic young man entering the army, he wanted to serve in the armored cavalry in a tank crew. He also was briefly a professional hair stylist with Luanne at the trendy salon Hottyz until it was discovered he wasn't homosexual. Bill and Luanne eventually worked for
Hank's barber, Jack, which brought in a young adult clientele and saved Jack from going out of business.
Several times throughout the series Bill is revealed to be very talented at cutting hair. When Hank receives a bad hair cut, Bill is able to fix it. He revealed to Hank that he dyed the hair of 53 officers who serve at Ft. Blanda. While working at Hottyz, Bill and Luanne rise to become "first chair." On another episode it is revealed that the General of the base that Bill cuts hair at won't allow anyone, but Bill, to cut his hair.
When he is engaged by other pursuits, such as when he toured with a choir group called the Harmonoholics or when he decided to run his own halfway house, Bill uses up all his personal and sick days from the army almost to the point of going AWOL; otherwise he doesn't use them at all. He is described as being nice but often depressed and lonely; his overwhelming need to make people like him makes him easily taken advantage of, particularly by Dale.
In the episode "Bill of Sales" it is also suggested that Bill has emotionally masochistic tendencies—explaining his lust for Peggy. No one finds Bill more repellent than her—and everyone finds Bill very repellent. After learning this, Peggy's attempt to, in her words, "'motivate' him, business term, with a little 'praise', my term, he goes plumb loco, Spanish term." Hank's response, "You must have confused him; being dumped on is all Bill knows" leads Peggy to conclude that "Bill has had a hard life and he likes it that way" and subsequently refers to him as a "nut job". She manages to persuade him to go back to work for her by verbally abusing him. However, she soon fires him out of feelings of guilt for taking advantage of his low self-esteem. It's also during this episode that Bill shows exceptional skills as a salesman, helping Peggy achieve her sales quotas quickly. However it could be seen as Bill didn't want to betray Hank (afraid that Peggy was coming onto him), and the reason for going back to help Peggy was fear she didn't want to even talk to him anymore. 
Peggy has said and done many cruel things to Bill, both to his face and behind his back with no regards to his feeling. But despite Bill's complete infatuation with Peggy, she seems to loathe him just as much. She brings him endless heartache, though it's not always intentional. For example, during a game of baseball, she once accidentally threw a bean-ball at his head, knocking him to the ground. She then mistakenly threw another at his crotch, putting him in excruciating pain and humiliation. She stole his prized American flag and accidentally destroyed it, driving him to absolute tears. Another time, angry at his endless pursuit of her, she hit him once at a game, she inadvertently wound up knocking him off the bleachers—his arm later in a sling. Despite all of this, she says she considers him "a friend."
According to "Drawn to Television" by M. Keith Booker, Bill "is a lonely figure who adds a touch of pathos to the humor of King of the Hill, which is often bittersweet." Jim Bawden of the Toronto Star describes Bill as a "sad sack". Voicing Bill and a couple other characters on the show is Stephen Root's favorite job. Many fans felt the writers should have ended the show with Bill finally meeting a soul mate
or suffering a sudden death to end his misery.

Van Boetzelaer

Van Boetzelaer (or: van den Boetzelaer) is an old aristocratic family that stems from the region of Kalkar, Germany.
The family history in the Duchy of Cleves can be traced back to the 13th century, when the van Boetzelaers belonged to the local nobility. A castle Boetzelaer is still in existence. 
Based on the similarity of their coat of arms, it is likely that the van Boetzelaer family are related to the Wesphalian von Galen family. In the sixteenth century, the family settled in The Netherlands. Nowadays, the family belongs to the Dutch nobility. Members carry the title of baron.

Marilar Aleixandre

María Pilar Jiménez Aleixandre (born 1947, in Madrid) is a Galician writer, translator and biologist. She lives in Amaía, Galicia, Spain. In her own words:
"I use the Galician Language as a literary language because I have a forked tongue, however not all the creatures with a forked tongue are bad. I think that all stories and poems are messages written in ink, spittle or blood, that we throw into space wishing that somebody receives them."
Life and career.
The grandparents of Marilar Aleixandre were from Andalucia, Valencia and Madrid. She was born in Madrid in 1947 and has lived in Ceuta and Doña Mencía (Córdoba). She has resided in Galicia since 1973 and has adopted the Galician language as her literary language. She is now one of the most famous Galician language writers. In her own words:
"I remember some things of every city where I lived: Ceuta (the lemon tree that we had in our courtyard); Doña Mencía (eating figs at the crack of dawn with my father); Madrid (the cinema club of Areneros, where I saw "Freaks" for the first time); Vigo (the mimosas in blossom); Santiago de Compostela...and other cities where I never lived or where I only lived for a short time: Donostia, Perugia, Boston. And I have a special relationship with Toba, Cée and with a Costa da Morte."
She is a lecturer of Biology at the University of Santiago de Compostela, where she has been teaching Environmental and Science Education since 1988.
Her first story was"Un Conto Sobre Vampiros", followed by "Agardando polos morcegos". She then published her first children's book "A formiga coxa", and "A expedición do Pacífico" (Premio da Crítica Galega 1995).
She was finalist of the Premio Xerais de Novela in 1992, with "Tránsito dos Gramáticos". In 1996 she published the book of stories "Lobos nas illas" about the difficulty of family relationships, in 1988 the novel "A Compañía Clandestina de Contrapublicidade" (Premio Álvaro Cunqueiro 1988), and in 2001 "Teoría do Caos" (Premio Xerais 2001). The majority of her works are translated to Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan and Basque.
She has translated the collection of poems "Muller ceiba" (1996) by Sandra Cisneros from English to Galician, as well as "A Caza do Carbairán" (1997) by Lewis Carrol and "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" (2001) by J.K. Rowling. She has also written the screenplay of 14 episodes of "Os escachapedras".
She has taken part in several collective publications of poetry and in the activities of the "Batallón Literario da Costa da Morte". In 1998 she won the Award Esquío with the collection of poems "Catálogo de velenos". Besides this, she has contributed to the culture and literature magazines "Nó", "Luzes de Galicia", "CLIJ", "Festa da Palabra Silenciada", "Dorna" and "El Signo del Gorrión". She also publishes academic works on teaching science.
Aleixandre has been quoted as saying that: "Writing allows us to invite people into the worlds that we have imagined."

Susan Laird

Susanne E. Laird (July 18, 1908 – November 7, 1933) was an American competition swimmer who represented the United States at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.
She was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania, and was one of four girls, including Josephine McKim and Lenore Kight, who trained at the Carnegie Library Athletic Club under coach Jack Scarry to represent the United States as members of the Olympic swim team. 
Susan began swimming at age 14 on the advice of a physician after developing St. Vitus Dance. The doctor believed swimming as a daily exercise would help to cure her nervous condition.
Susan won her first championship in 1924 at Lake Elizabeth in Pittsburgh, winning the 50-yard freestyle in 32 seconds. She placed second in the 100 meters and third in the 300-yard medley at the 1926 Sesquicentennial in Philadelphia. That year, she went on to win the national 100-yard junior championship.
In 1928 she qualified for the American Olympic Team, and traveled aboard the S.S. President Roosevelt to Amsterdam, Holland, for the 1928 Summer Olympics. Susan finished fifth in the 100 metre freestyle event. She also helped the American relay team to qualify for the final of the 4 x 100 metre freestyle relay competition as they set a new world record in the semi-finals. Susan did not swim in the finals, although she received a gold medal along with the American team as they went on to finish first.
After graduating from Temple University in 1930, Susan was appointed girls' coach and physical education instructor at Homestead High School, a position she held until her death from a rare blood disorder and subsequent pneumonia at age 25.

Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Infant Jesus Convent, commonly referred to as Infant Jesus Convent (IJC) is a secondary school for girls in the city of Malacca, Malaysia. It is also sometimes referred to as the Main Convent or the French Convent (as opposed to the Portuguese Convent, Cannossa).
SMK Infant Jesus Convent Malacca is a semi-government funded daily school. This means that syllabus and school activities are regulated by the Ministry of Education, but the school receives little help for repairing and maintaining its condition, because the land is still under church authority.
As of 2008, IJC is the last remaining IJ Convent in Malaysia whose land is still under church authority.
Location.
IJC is located in the heart of Malacca City, and is a stone's throw away from the historic A Famosa fort and a number of shopping malls. It is situated exactly in front of SK Convent Infant Jesus 1 and 2, its primary sister schools.

Like other secondary schools, it offers lower and upper secondary educations: Form 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Forms 4 and 5 are split into 2 basic streams, Sciences and Humanities. The School also offers 6th Form education in Mathematics and Humanities.
The school is known for its performance in public exams, notably PMR (Lower Secondary Evaluation) and SPM (Malaysian Education Certificate). In 2007, there were 100% passes in the SPM, a feat considered remarkable for a daily school without the privilege of selecting its students.
School Anthem.
Oh, Oh, Oh Let's all in harmony sing,
Of the school we love so dear,
The life we lead so happily,
Among sisters and teachers and friends
So, Let's rejoice this day and remember,
Simple in virtue,
Then Our cares will fade away,
Let us sing
Let's sing of student days,
Of good and jolly days,
When students hope and pray,
To come back some fine day
So let our hearts rejoice,
As once again we sing,
One of the olden days,
Of students days
We must get on sad to say,
List to our vocation call,
But we'll think of student days,
God bless them one and all ^_^ -->

SMK Convent held its 64th Annual Sports Day recently at Stadium Perak. The event was officiated by Dato’ Ir. Dr. Safry Kamal, Chairman of Parent-Teacher Association. The event began with a march-pass of the participating contingents. Their ability to march in sync with the music impressed the crowd of on-lookers and supporters in the stadium stands.
The highlight was definitely the inter-school 4x100m race between the host, SMK Methodist (P), SMJK Ave Maria Convent, SMJK Perempuan Cina Perak and SMK Jalan Pasir Puteh. SMK Convent and SMJK Perempuan Cina Perak clinched the Under-15 and Under-18 titles, respectively.
Unique to the event was the cheerleading competition which drew much attention from the crowd. In line with the school’s vision to become one of the top 200 schools in Malaysia by 2012, the principal, Mdm. Lim Swee Kew, said that achievements in sports and academics were key criteria in achieving the position.
The march-pass competition was won by the Kadet Remaja Sekolah while Red House was the adjudged the overall champion. Ong Zong Lin and Cheng Zen Li were crowned Main Convent’s Sportswomen of the Year.

82nd Street Academics

82nd Street Academics is a non-profit educational institution located in Jackson Heights, New York City. The school is housed at the Community United Methodist Church of Jackson Heights.
History.
The Community Church began offering Pre-School classes in 1974. Summer School classes were added in 1985 and aimed at parents who wanted their children to have extra academic preparation during summer vacations. An After School program was started in 1998 with the goal of helping children with homework and providing low-cost tutoring. The organization also opened private Kindergarten classes in the same year.
In 2002, with the opening of a New York City public school on the same street, 82nd Street Academics discontinued the private Kindergarten classes and became a community-based Universal Pre-Kindergarten provider under a contract with the Department of Education.
A year later, the school was incorporated separately from the church as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and the various programs were united under the guiding mission of helping students take "early steps to college" through early academic foundations.
Current Offerings.
Today, 82nd Street Academics accepts over 600 enrollments each year in several different programs: Pre-School (half-day or full-day), Universal Pre-Kindergarten, Extended Day, After School, Summer School, and prep courses SHSAT and SAT. The SAT Prep Course is provided for high school seniors at Renaissance Charter School as part of a consulting contract.
The school is licensed by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to operate the Pre-School, Universal Pre-K, and Summer School programs, and by the New York State Office of Children and Family Services for the After School program.
The Learning Park playground - completed in the fall of 2009 - offers children in the community a unique play experience.

Shang archaeology

Shang archaeology is concerned with the archaeological evidence for the Shang Dynasty. Choice of excavation sites and interpretation of finds have been heavily influenced by the textual historical record.
Excavation sites.
The earliest and to-date most well known Shang site is Anyang in Henan province. Work began in 1928 initially as an investigation of the source of oracle bones. It was carried out by a team from the new research organisation Academia Sinica, and directed by the Harvard-trained anthropologist Li Ji. Fifteen seasons of excavation were carried out at Anyang until 1937, when the Second Sino-Japanese War forced the archaeologists to evacuate. During that time, the Anyang excavators uncovered large pounded-earth ("hangtu") architectural foundations, sacrificial burial cemeteries, and gigantic shaft tombs, not to mention caches of bronze vessels. Historians have come to associate the site with Yinxu, the traditional name of the Shang capital for the last twelve kings of the dynasty, starting with Pan Geng. Excavations at Anyang resumed in 1950, under the auspices of a new Institute of Archaeology, and a permanent field station was established there in 1958.
The successes at Anyang encouraged further archaeological efforts, awareness of which has been fostered by the State Bureau of Cultural Relics. In 1952, excavations at Erligang, near Zhengzhou, disclosed the remains of a walled city at least as large as Anyang, but from a demonstrably earlier period. Excavations were difficult, however, because the ancient city lay beneath the modern one.
The still older site of Erlitou, near Luoyang, was discovered in 1959 by a survey prospecting for Xia remains. The three sites of Erlitou, Erligang, and Anyang have been taken to provide a complete chronological sequence for the early Bronze Age in China.
There have also been other finds away from the Yellow River valley. A significant early achievement was the discovery of an Erligang-period city at Panlongcheng, not far from the Yangzi River. Further and more distinct finds surfaced later in the middle and lower Yangzi regions, including the Wucheng site in Jiangxi, suggesting local civilisations separate from those of the Yellow River region. This argument has grown stronger with the discoveries further afield – that of spectacular sacrificial pits at Sanxingdui, Sichuan in 1986, and of a rich tomb at Xin'gan, Jiangxi, in 1989.
Oracle bones.
Oracle bones were first recognised for their true nature in 1898, and scholars have been labouring to decipher them ever since. They circulated among collectors and antique dealers, and to this day some 200,000 oracle bone fragments from the Xiaotun site in Anyang have been counted.
These inscriptions record the pyromantic divinations performed at the court of the Shang kings. The king or his diviners would address an oral "charge" to a specially prepared turtle plastron or cattle scapula while applying a hot poker or brand to produce a series of heat cracks in the shell or bone. They then interpreted these cracks as auspicious or inauspicious, after which engravers carved into the surface of the shell or bone the subject of the charge, sometimes the forecast, and less frequently the result.
Bronze metallurgy.
Bronze has been left behind in China in quantities not comparable to anywhere else in the world. Both technologically and artistically, the metalworking tradition that arose in China is unlike any other in the world.
The technological feature which distinguishes Shang bronzes from those found elsewhere in the world is the technique of casting as opposed to hammering. Casting was a far more extravagant technique compared to hammering, and required both abundant mineral resources and organisation of labour.
The earliest evidence for bronze casting are the two dozen bronze vessels unearthed at Erlitou. Bronzes appear in much large quantities at Erligang, and show technological and artistic advances.

Wrath Tour

Wrath Tour was a concert tour by American heavy metal band Lamb of God in support of the group's sixth studio album, "Wrath", which was released in February 2009.
The tour began in November 2008 with a headline date in the band's hometown of Richmond, Virginia. The following month, the band toured North America as the main support act to Metallica on their World Magnetic Tour. The group met controversy when they were banned from playing at The Forum in Inglewood, California, where Metallica were booked for two dates. Faithful Central Bible Church, the owners of The Forum, refused to let the group perform after they had learned the band formerly went by the name "Burn the Priest". This was the second occasion Lamb of God ran into a dispute with the venue; the group were previously banned from performing in 2005 while supporting Slipknot on their Subliminal Verses Tour. The group announced shows in outlying cities in lieu of the ban.
In February 2009, the band toured Europe; a number of the U.K. dates were part of a package tour sponsored by Metal Hammer dubbed "Defenders of the Faith" featuring Dimmu Borgir as co-headliners. The group then toured Australia through March as part of the Soundwave Festival, which was headlined by Nine Inch Nails and Alice in Chains. In April 2009, the group began a headlining North American tour, sponsored by No Fear Energy. The leg began in Phoenix, Arizona and wrapped up mid-May in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In July 2009, during a European summer tour, guitarist Mark Morton exited the tour prior to the final six dates as he and his wife were expecting their first child. Morton was replaced by Buz McGrath of Unearth for the remaining summer dates, and Doc Coyle of God Forbid for.the first three weeks of a fall North American leg. Morton eventually rejoined the group in October in Tampa, Florida.
The show in Prague at Abaton on May 24, 2010 was the subject of manslaughter charges against vocalist Randy Blythe in 2012 and 2013. The court eventually ruled that Blythe was not criminally liable and acquitted him on March 5, 2013.

Not Without a Fight

Not Without a Fight is the sixth studio album by American rock band New Found Glory. It was released on March 10, 2009 through independent label Epitaph Records. Produced by Blink-182 singer-bassist Mark Hoppus and recorded at his home based-OPRA Studios, the album was seen as a return to the band's energetic roots in comparison to its predecessor; the mellow "Coming Home" (2006). The gap between releases marked the longest period between studio albums in the band's career thus far, while the title is taken from the lyrics in opening track, "Right Where We Left Off".
In the United States, opening week sales reached 26,900 units allowing it to debut at number one on the "Billboard" Independent Albums Chart and number twelve on the "Billboard" 200. This marked their fourth consecutive album to debut in the top twenty on the "Billboard" chart, despite leaking six weeks prior to its official release. The album was released early in Australia to coincide with the band's appearance at the Soundwave Festival and it debuted at number thirty six on the ARIA Charts.
Background.
Following the release, promotion and touring of "Coming Home" (2006), the band parted ways with major label Geffen Records in early 2007. Steve Klein, the band's chief lyricist and rhythm guitarist explained that due to the label undergoing several management changes, the band were left feeling isolated; "At the time of "Coming Home" being released, this guy who was the president was all about Pussycat Dolls and all that pop and R&B. It came out at a time when they weren't really caring about their rock bands. And you know, we had a choice to be on that label again for the next one and we just decided that we didn't want to be part of a label that didn't want to put out rock music." The band subsequently recorded their second cover album, "From the Screen to Your Stereo Part II" (2007) without a record contract, before agreeing a distribution deal with former label Drive-Thru Records. After writing and recording several demos in the interim period, lead guitarist and composer Chad Gilbert contacted Mark Hoppus early in 2008 to discuss a possible project. When they met, Gilbert showed Hoppus the series of rough demos from his iPod and it was then agreed to record an album in Hoppus' home studio, despite the band not being signed to a label at the time.
Recording and production.
The band entered the studio in the latter part of May 2008, and completed recording in July. Hoppus later stated that he was willing to take part in the project as he would be working with a band with a "definite sound" in mind, but who "also wanted input and guidance from someone they trusted." The producer also commented afterward that, "We worked really hard to get great, gritty guitars, big drums, edgy bass, and Jordan is singing stronger than he ever has. The songs really came together, and I can't wait for people to hear this record." Upon completion of the album, the band were in a position to present songs to various record labels. Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz, already a keen admirer of the band, signed them to his long running independent label Epitaph Records in late 2008, with a view to release the album in early 2009. Speaking of the recording sessions, Steve Klein praised the "lighthearted" atmosphere amongst Hoppus and the band; "He didn't take himself too seriously and we don't take ourselves too seriously, either. Every day, you'd wake up and go, "Man, I can't wait to get to the studio."
Composition.
The album's overall sound was seen as a "return to form", going back to the band's faster and energetic roots. This was mainly because previous album, "Coming Home", was viewed as a more mellow, mid-tempo and sentimental record. Fans made comparisons with the band's eponymous second album, while critics often noted a growing maturity. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that the album contains, "choppy guitars and emotional choruses", and predicted that, "fans of their older work will be pleased." Mike Demante of the "Houston Chronicle" reported that, ""Not Without a Fight" is full of those catchy choruses and gang vocals that fans have come to love. The album is a return to form, whilst still incorporating the indie-rock of its Geffen records’ swan song, "Coming Home", and last year’s melodic hardcore EP "Tip of the Iceberg"." Brendan Manley of "Alternative Press" said that, "opening track, “Right Where We Left Off,” builds upon a chunky guitar riff that recalls classic NFG, yet surprises with smart, subtle rhythmic twists. NFG’s true maturity though, shines in the album’s skillful composition that offers up instant classics like “Heartless At Best”." "The A.V Club" critic Aaron Burgess was in agreeance; "Maturity remains a guiding principle on "Not Without A Fight"—the band strikes a keen balance between hard-hitting, soft-hearted, youthfully exuberant, and all grown up." Kelly Knickerbocker of the "Dallas Observer" also noted, "Heartbreak bodes well for creative processes, it seems. "Not Without A Fight" is full of performances by pissed-off dudes who are taking it back to their roots: raw punk-pop, with crafty and sometimes cynical lyrics."
The metaphor for the album title was described by Gilbert as "our personal war and the wars that you have in relationships with your loved ones. When you want something bad enough in life you have to fight for it. That’s like with our band. We love being in this band, and we’ll do whatever it takes to continue." Drummer Cyrus Bolooki further explained, "I think it just kind of goes in with the whole idea that we've been around for a while, and we really feel like a resurgence for us that after eleven years now we're still relevant. We're on tours with bands like Four Year Strong, A Day To Remember and you know, a lot of these bands maybe first got into bands like us, so it's almost like another generation." Musically, Gilbert explained that unlike the harmony-driven "Coming Home", the band wanted to return to a more energetic style both because of the embittered lyrics and the need to translate songs live. "We love songs off "Coming Home", but live we couldn't really rock out to them. And that's what we love. So I think naturally I was wanting rhythms that I knew I'd have fun playing live." He supported this by explaining the band's desire to alternate between albums; "Every album New Found Glory’s released is different in its own way, and we’ll continue to work that way. When we write albums, whatever comes out, comes out. We’re always real, and I think that’s why we still have the fans we do." Much of the lyrical themes also come in contrast to "Coming Home", largely due to divorces that Pundik and Gilbert went through since writing the previous album, as well as their departure from Geffen Records. Most topics deal with reflection and bitterness towards the former relationships. Gilbert found the best way to express these emotions was to revisit the fast-paced style of the band’s earlier days. "The truth of the matter is that when we did "Coming Home" we were all in love. I was engaged, Jordan was engaged, But since that time my relationship failed, Jordan's relationship failed and going into this record we had a lot of angst. We didn't aim to make a faster, more energetic record. That's just what really came out because of our natural emotion."
Release and promotion.
The album was released through Epitaph Records on digipack and digital download formats, as well as vinyl on Bridge Nine Records on March 13, 2009. Over a month before its official release, the album leaked online. In response to this, guitarist Chad Gilbert stated although he was disappointed, he was happy for his band's music to be heard by any means: "As far as the leaking thing. If my favorite bands CD came out early online I would download it too. I will still buy it though because when I love a band I've got to have the album packaging and artwork. The whole building up to release date loses a bit of its excitement but to be honest, the fans that would go out of their way to download it are the true fans that go out of their way to buy merch and are the ones that will know the words first and sing every song at the show."
The first single from the album was "Listen to Your Friends", and was released on December 23, 2008. The music video, which was shot on November 5, 2008 in LA, premiered on March 9, 2009. The quintet set out on tour to support the album release in March along with Set Your Goals, Bayside and Shai Hulud. During the summer, the band made appearances for major festivals at the Rock AM Ring in Germany and Reading and Leeds in England. Soon afterwards, Cyrus Bolooki confirmed they had finished shooting the video for second single "Don't Let Her Pull You Down". The video premiered on October 15, and was released on October 20 via limited orange and sky blue vinyl prints. Touring continued well into 2010, with the band headlining the Slam Dunk Festival along with Alkaline Trio and Capdown. Later in June, it was announced the band were shooting the video for "Truck Stop Blues", acting as promotion for the band's appearance on the 2010 Honda Civic Tour. The video was later released via the band's Twitter and Facebook pages on 21 July.
Reception.
Critical response.
"Not Without a Fight" garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics, as it has gained a 61 out of 100. Critic Ryan Cooper of About.com gave a favorable four star review, describing the overall sound as one "that bounces between chunky punk riffs and addictive pop hooks" while also stating, "it’s a straight-up representation of who New Found Glory has become, marking a return to classic pop punk". Joe DeAndrea, staff reviewer for AbsolutePunk, awarded a score of 86%. He said of the band that, "on "Not Without a Fight", it's clear that New Found Glory still haven't lost their knack of creating an album with sing-a-long choruses and memorable guitar riffs that fans will love." He described the songs as "energy filled" and noted the album was "another breath of fresh air within a genre saturated with vocoder and neon. Andrew Leahey, in his review for Allmusic, awarded the album 3½ stars out of five. He praised the "mature performance" of frontman Jordan Pundik; "Unlike his younger pop-punk contemporaries, though, Pundik no longer seems smitten with the idea of a happy relationship. There are precious few traces of the urgent, here's-to-the-night ethos that other groups champion so heartily. Taken as a whole, "Not Without a Fight" is a pleasant listen, mature in its outlook, and happily adolescent in its vigor".
"Alternative Press" journalist Brendan Manley also awarded a score of 3½ stars out of five and claimed, "throughout "Fight", it's the guitars, fueled by drummer Cyrus Bolooki's frenetic tempos, that exude the greatest return to form. From “47,” with its near-speed-metal breakdown to the raucous “I’ll Never Love Again” to the fluid, Tom DeLonge-esque guitar lines in “Truck Stop Blues,” it becomes abundantly clear that guitarists Chad Gilbert and Steve Klein have rediscovered their mojo and have come to rock." Despite stating that the album lacked consistency in the latter half, he summarised that, "the record is a reminder of why we fell in love with NFG in the first place and for many of us, that's enough." "Billboard" magazine were also favourable, stating, "With Blink-182/+44 bassist Mark Hoppus producing, "Fight" does pack a wallop, enveloping frontman Jordan Pundik's angsty relationship paeans on a dozen compact, dynamic and hooky tracks in a mere 35 minutes". Alex Hofford of North Carolina State University-based newspaper, the "Technician", awarded the album 4½ stars out of five in his review. He called the album a "paradigm of the pop-punk craze from earlier in the decade", while noting, "New Found Glory has successfully combined the sounds from their previous ventures into one sonically cohesive album. Even when the band wants to slow down the pace with more melodic songs like "Reasons" and "Heartless At Best," they don't ruin the flow of the album. This is one "fight" you shouldn't miss." "Q" magazine writer Dave Everley awarded the album a "good" three out of five stars, opining that, "New Found Glory's newfound maturity makes for a palatable record that will soothe lovelorn rockers. It may not be their defining release, but its a reminder as to why the fivesome have garnered such a devout following."
"Rock Sound" magazine were highly impressed and gave a score of nine out of ten, lauding the album as the band's best work to date. Andrew Kelham opined that, "each song is a thick cut of pop punk played to perfection by a group of musicians who have taken a genre by the throat and defined it with their sound". "The A.V Club" critic Aaron Burgess awarded the album a "B" grade and remarked; "the loud-guitar and crunching-rhythm style that drives the album, demonstrates that, softening middle years be damned, New Found Glory still hits hard enough to matter". Adam Webb, staff writer for Ultimate-Guitar was also largely favourable in his review, awarding a score of 8.3/10. He commented that the band had, "created a rockin' pop punk album that shows just why they stand so tall above the crowd of uneventful scenesters that is the tragedy of the music scene today". Hailing the band as the "undisputed kings of pop punk", he finalised his review by adding, "You'd be clinically insane not to give this album a go. Either that or you're blind, deaf and dumb. In which case you have a valid reason and a much bigger problem at hand". However, other reviews were less receptive. Tom Bryant of British magazine "Kerrang!" was critical of the album's sound; "Their major label record deal came to a conclusion and they scurried back to the sort of independent punk label on which they first made their name. Next, they ask blink-182's Mark Hoppus to produce, a man who, intermittenty, is in the band to who NFG once aspired to be. It all begs the question as to whether this is a sound of a brand trying to recapture the past; a band having a midlife crisis." In his review for "Rocklouder!", critic John Webber noted that "By no means is this a bad record; in fact it easily lays waste to most releases in the same vain this side of "Coming Home", but when held up against such a stunning back catalogue, it is certainly not an essential purchase for any new fans." PopMatters echoed this sentiment by writing, "It doesn’t mean they’ve made a bad album here, just a predictable one. Attempting a traditionalist record in any genre is a game of constraints, and those constraints are fully felt on "Not Without a Fight"."

Centrifugal Funk

Centrifugal Funk is the second and final studio album by the Mark Varney Project (MVP), released in 1991 through Legato Records; a remastered edition was reissued in 2004 through Tone Center Records. This incarnation of the group is a collaboration between guitarists Frank Gambale, Brett Garsed and Shawn Lane. It consists primarily of covers of existing jazz fusion compositions, save for one track performed by Lane—"Lane's Blitz"—which he later dismissed as an impromptu warm-up rather than a planned solo, and thus his dislike for it. Varney, however, disputes Lane's version of events.
The cover art on the original release features a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer to listeners: ""Warning: Contains guitar performances of unparalleled speed, taste and virtuosity. Not for the faint of heart!"", whilst the back cover has an invitation from Varney asking fans to send in demo tapes of potential guitarists for his label, in return for a named mention within the credits on a future album, as well as five Legato releases mailed to them for free.

Nevada State Route 396

State Route 396 (SR 396) is a state highway in Pershing County, Nevada serving the city of Lovelock. The highway forms a portion of Interstate 80 Business within the city of Lovelock, and previously carried the alignment of former U.S. Route 40.
Route description.
SR 396 begins at the West Lovelock interchange with Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 95. The route follows Cornell Avenue north into the center of the town. The highway crosses Main Street (SR 398) and continues along Cornell Avenue to its end at a five-point intersection with 14th Street, Airport Road (SR 856) and Upper Valley Road near the Lovelock city limits. Here, State Route 396 turns to follow Upper Valley Road.
As the route heads northeast out of Lovelock, the surroundings become more rural in nature with open farmland on both sides of the highway. The highway also parallels the Union Pacific railroad tracks for some distance. Eventually, SR 396 turns east to intersect I-80 again at the Coal Canyon interchange, where the route terminates.
The Cornell Avenue portion of State Route 396 also carries a portion of Lovelock's Interstate 80 Business Loop. The business route diverges from SR 396 at 14th Street, following Airport Road back to I-80.
History.
SR 396 was originally part of State Route 1. That route, designated with the passage of Nevada's first highway law in 1917, created a highway route across northern Nevada from California to Utah which passed through Lovelock. With the adoption of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, U.S. Route 40 was eventually added concurrently with SR 1.
With the advent of the Interstate Highway system, Interstate 80 gradually replaced US 40 across northern Nevada and was removed from Lovelock by 1976. Also around this time, the Nevada Department of Transportation was beginning to renumber, its highways eliminating the State Route 1 designation and redesignating the Lovelock portion on Cornell Avenue and Upper Valley Road as State Route 396. Even though the cross-state designations of US 40 and SR 1 had been eliminated by the mid-1970s, construction of the Interstate 80 freeway in Lovelock was not started until 1981, so through traffic continued to use State Route 396 in the city.

Apparitions (TV series)

Apparitions is a BBC drama about Father Jacob Myers, a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, played by Martin Shaw, who examines evidence of miracles to be used in canonisation but also performs exorcisms. As he learns, Jacob's duties run deeper than just sending demons back to Hell; he later must prevent them all from escaping. 
Unlike most portrayals of exorcism and spirit possession in fiction, "Apparitions" is more religiously accurate and fact-based, incorporating the nature of demonic possession as described by the Church. It also recounts historical events associated with Christianity and other Abrahamic religions, which may have been caused by (or directly influenced) Heaven or Hell, indicating that the War described in the Bible may not have fully concluded.
The series is written by Joe Ahearne.

Episode 1.
First Broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD, 13 November 2008 at 21:00
In 1997 in Calcutta, an exorcist is called to the Suppiah Cardiac Hospital where Mother Teresa is hospitalised, believing her to be possessed or under attack. Elsewhere, a destitute boy named Vimal, who is diagnosed with leprosy, prays to Jesus at a shrine to Teresa. As Teresa dies, Vimal collapses, seizing.
In the present day in Rome, a meeting is being held at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Father Jacob, a London priest and investigator of miracles for the Congregation, has presented a case that may lead to Mother Teresa's canonization: Vimal's leperosy was seemingly cured without antibiotics six months after Teresa's death. The Cardinal turns this miracle down, for lack of a better one. Vimal has recently finished training for priesthood at Jacob's seminary.
A homeless man approaches Jacob as he leaves, saying strange things, then disappearing. The story then shifts to a seminary in London, where a young girl has persisted in asking Father Jacob to perform an exorcism on her father, whom she thinks is possessed by a demon. Her father, a divorced atheist, refuses to admit that he is possessed and agrees to a few prayers with Jacob to placate his daughter, only after much coaxing. As Jacob prays, with Vincenzo assisting over the phone, her father becomes increasingly agitated and angry, physically attacking Jacob, who finally flees, the exorcism incomplete. The father is then confronted by Jacob and Vincenzo in the park and they complete the exorcism, while the demon comments that they "take our miracle with us." Meanwhile, the seminary student, Vimal, a student of Jacob, is haunted by a demon, the same vagrant who spoke to Jacob in Rome, who refers to himself as "we" and keeps threatening to take back Vimal's skin, unless he "uses it". Vimal was spontaneously cured of leprosy, when he was a child, while saying the prayer of Mother Teresa just as she died, (a miracle he had offered as proof of her right to sainthood). But he is visited by the apparition of this demon, and comes to realize that it was, in fact, demons who restored his flesh (the miracle attributed to Mother Teresa). The guilt that he feels over his homosexuality preys on him - despite being a virgin. Eventually, Cardinal Bukovak, the top dog in the British Church and the boss of Jacob, discovers this and expels him from the priesthood. Filled with despair, rejecting Jacob's imprecations to remain and study and talk, Vimal goes right down the tubes, first swilling back lots of wine to build up his courage - and to chat with the demon pal who incites him to "use" his skin or have his leprosy restored, - to visit a cliché bath house, where the demon appears and skins him alive in vengeance as the girl's father is freed of his possession by Jacob and Vincenzo at the same spot in Kensington Gardens where the girl had been conceived at the moment of Mother Teresa's death.

However, Father Jacob now realizes that people close to him are being deliberately targeted by demons. The homeless man appears repeatedly, challenging Jacob to a kind of exorcism duel - they shall battle each other for supremacy and see who comes out on top, God or Lucifer. There are puzzles and clues that lead to some amalgam of the Holocaust, hell, heaven, the next Vatican exorcist, the usual stuff. This mystery leads Father Jacob into the past of Monsignor Vincenzo. Meanwhile, Cardinal Bukovak begins to prevent Father Jacob from practicing future exorcisms.

Episode 6.
First Broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD, 18 December 2008 at 21:00
Possessed now and unable to pray, Jacob is stalked by Michael. Cardinal Bukovak assigns an atheist psychologist Dr. Elaine Errison, to assess Jacob, who believes that his religious beliefs (and Christianity) are a kind of mental illness. After being relieved of his duties, Jacob leaves the seminary and stays in a hotel where a mysterious woman tells him that anyone who attempts to exorcise him will be killed. Jacob challenges Satan to have him exorcised so that Satan may destroy Jacob's faith. Rising to the challenge, Satan allows Vincenzo to escape prison so that the former chief exorcist may attempt and fail to exorcise Jacob thus destroying Jacob's faith in God's power. Vincenzo, convinced by the soul of his father speaking through Jacob, actually exorcises Jacob and is struck down by Satan for his defiance. Sister Ruth and Father Daniel meanwhile have studied Bukovak's computer and discover a connection to a ceremony where the Pope will be present. Jacob heads to stop Michael’s plan. At the church where the ceremony and Pope are, Michael enters the church unimpeded, having consumed a bible. The mysterious woman who threatened Jacob attacks Ruth in the catacombs under the church. Ruth is saved by Jacob and in the struggle the mysterious woman is set on fire. As the flaming woman enters the church and collapses, havoc ensues and Michael levitates above the room, aiming his pistol at the Pope. With Jacob, Daniel and Ruth all reciting the prayer, Michael is vanquished, but in his final moments puts a bullet into Cardinal Bukovak, who is subsequently promoted for apparently attempting to defend the Pope. As he departs he makes it clear that he will continue to work to destroy the practice of exorcism, and Jacob implies that he is ready for Bukovak’s efforts.

Kintla Lake Ranger Station

The Kintla Lake Ranger Station in Glacier National Park is a rustic log structure that was built by the Butte Oil Company in 1900 at Kintla Lake. It was taken over by the National Park Service and used as a ranger station. It is significant as a remnant of early oil exploration activities in the Glacier area. A boathouse was built by the National Park Service in 1935 to the same design as the boathouses at Upper Lake McDonald and Saint Mary ranger stations. A fire cache cabin, identical to those at Logging Creek, Polebridge and Lake McDonald ranger stations was built in 1934.

Holistic community

A holistic community (also referred to as closed or unitary) is one where the species within the community are interdependent on each other for keeping balance and stability of the system. This is a term important in ecology. These communities are oftentimes described as working like a superorganism, meaning that every species plays an important part in the overall well being of the ecosystem which the community resides; much like the organelles within a cell, or even the cells making up one organism. Holistic communities have diffused boundaries, and an independent species range. Co-evolution is likely to be found in communities structured after this model, as a result of the interdependence and high rates of interaction found among the different populations. It is said that species compositions of communities change sharply at environmental edges (known as ecotones).
The ideas of a holistic community were introduced by plant ecologist Frederic Clements in 1916. These notions were countered by Henry Gleason in 1917, when he proposed the individualistic/open community concept (in applications to plants). Neither of these ecological concepts have been found to exist in entirety, both are theories which can be applied to communities. For example, a community's composition can be better explained by holism than individualism, or vice versa. This ecological concept is based on the broader concept of holism, which describes the functionality of any system as having many individual parts, all of which are extremely important to the system's viability.
"A community has been viewed as a superorganism with an integrity analogous to that of cells in an organism. This is the holistic or unitary view of a community, and one championed by Clements (1916). He regarded the community to be a highly integrated unit that operated very much within itself with little interaction with surrounding communities - a closed community."

The Woman Taken in Adultery (Rembrandt)

The Woman Taken in Adultery is a painting of 1644 by Rembrandt, bought by the National Gallery, London in 1824, as one of their foundation batch of paintings. It is in oil on oak, and 83.8 x 65.4 cm.
Rembrandt shows the episode of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery from the Gospel of Saint John. In this scene, a few Jews, mainly Scribes and Pharisees, tried to catch Jesus condoning disobedience to the Jewish Law, knowing that Jesus pitied wrong-doers. To do this, they produced a woman who had been caught taking part in adultery. Then, they said "Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say about her?". Jesus replied, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her" (John 8: 3-7) 
Rembrandt made Jesus appear taller than the other figures and more brightly lit. In contrast, the Jews are "in the dark" and appear lower. Symbolically, Jesus's height represents his moral superiority over those who attempted to trick him.

Laulasi Island

Laulasi island is an artificial island in the Langa Langa Lagoon, South of Auki on the island of Malaita in the Solomon Islands. It is believed that Headhunter tribes from mainland Malaita forced some people into the lagoon where over time they built their islands on sandbars after diving for coral. The people of Laulasi were the only persons to oppose the British from establishing a protectorate. Pagan traditions on the island results in the heads of deceased Chiefs and Priests collected in a sacred part of the island. These lagoon people believe that the spirits of their deceased live in the sharks in the island and are also famous for their minting of traditional shell money.
History.
In Malaita legend, the first settlement on the island began around 3,000 BC at a place called Siale. The first places in the Malaita area to be settled were "Dukwasi"(Kwara'ae speaking people), and the "Asi" (man-made islands) namely: Aoke, Kaloka and Rarata in Langa Langa lagoon, Laulasi, Alite Koalia and Gwa'ata – Ta'alulolo.
It is also believed the early settlers originated from Mt. Kolovrat (Alasa'a), the highest peak on the main Malaita Island. The early settlers were believed to be castaways from the Alasa'a community. Some said they chose not to return to Alasa´a because of the distance. Its an approximately two days walk. And the main reason why they came is to fish and in search for other sea foods in the island of Launasi meaning ´´I'm stuck´´now known as Laulasi. From then they named the island Launasi in relation to the expression.
After they had settled, other people began to arrive from different parts of Malaita and outside to settle in the Langalanga lagoon. They came from Small Malaita, Florida (Ngella), some came from the northern part of Guadalcanal believed to be from Longuvalasi area and others from the northern region of Malaita. Through inter-marriages, their descendants spread to the whole of the Langalanga lagoon. Certain cultural features or "Tambu House" (Place of the first settlements) are still preserved which attest to the settlement patterns that were made.
1800–1900.
In 1892 the Queensland government Australia abandoned the Pacific labour trade known as Blackbirding and in 1901 the Commonwealth of Australia enacted the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 which facilitated the deportation of Pacific Islanders that was the precursor to the White Australia policy.
Britain was provided with a "plausible excuse for protecting the Solomons" and so protecting their labour reserves. By declaring a protectorate, the British were able to justify keeping out other colonial powers.
In 1893 then Gibson of HMS Curacoa (1854) sailed around the islands to declare a protectorate with the only opposition by the Laulasi villages who refused the British flag. When Gibson asked why the flag was refused, the villages were afraid that their acceptance of it would signify to the bush people that by aligning themselves with Britain the lagoon dwellers were preparing for war and this would lead the bush people discontinuing trade with the lagoon people, who had no gardens and were dependent on food.
1911 – Author Jack London.
American author Jack London travelled to Langa Langa in a yacht in 1907.
"We ran down the lagoon from Langa Langa, between mangrove swamps through passages scaresly wider than the Monota, and passed the reef villages of Kaloka and Auki. Like the founders of Venice, these salt water men were originally refugees form the mainland. Too weak to hold their own in the bush, survivors of village massacres, they fled to the sand banks of the lagoon. These sand banks they built up into islands and they were compelled to seek their provender from the sea. They developed canoo bodies, unable to walk about, spending all their time in the canoos, they became thick armed and broad shouldered with narrow waists and frail legs" (p 138)
"I sailed in the teak-built ketch, the Minota, on a blackbirding cruise to Malaita, and I took my wife along. The hatchet-marks were still raw on the door of our tiny stateroom advertising an event of a few months before. The event was the taking of Captain Mackenzie's head, Captain Mackenzie, at that time, being master of the Minota... As we sailed in to Langa-Langa on the shore side of the lagoon, was Binu, the place where the Minota was captured a year previously and her captain killed by the bushmen of Malaita, having been hacked to pieces and eaten" (p 135)
"He(Mackenzie) believed in kindness. He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons. On his second trip to Malaita, recruiting,he ran into Bina, which is near Langa Langa. The rifles with which the boat's-crew should have been armed, were locked up in his cabin. When the whale-boat went ashore after recruits, he paraded around the deck without even a revolver on him. He was tomahawked. His head remains in Malaita. It was suicide.
The Log of the Snark states:
"..still bore the tomahawk marks where the Malaitans at Langa Langa several months before broke in for the trove of rifles and ammunition locked therein, after bloodily slaughtering Jansen's predecessor, Captain Mackenzie. The burning of the vessel was somehow prevented by the black crew, but this was so unprecedented that the owner feared some complicity between them and the attacking party. However, it could not be proved, and we sailed with the majority of this same crew. The present skipper smilingly warned us that the same tribe still required two more heads from the Minota, to square up for deaths on the Ysabel plantation. (p 387)
"Three fruitless days were spent at Su'u. The Minota got no recruits from the bush and the bushmen got no heads from the Minota. We towed out with a whaleboat and ran along the coast to Langa Langa, a large village of salt-water people built with labour on a sand bank – literally built up"
World War II.
On the morning of 7 August 1942 (same date as the US Landings on Guadacanal),
"..seven US planes bombed the island. The reason was due to an error namely that the Americans mistook Laulasi for the Japanese camp at Afufu in North Malaita. Which resulted in the killing 24 children, destroying the shell money industry and the incident still remains the subject of an unresolved compensation claim".
The British resident commissioner wrote in his diary:
"7 US planes bombed Laulasi village – 18 killed – most inexplicable as no enemy repeorted there"(Marchant 7 Aug 1942)
"The bombing of Laulasi island was the worst loss of civilian lives in the entire Solomon Islands conflict".
Cultural Practices and Beliefs.
"The LangaLanga and Kwara'ae people more or less have the same cultural and traditional practices and follow the same chiefly system. Male children for example are more valued than females because they will continue with the line or tribe. Girls are not so preferred because they leave the community when they get married. Boys are separated from their parents when they are around 12 or 13 years old to live separate in the men's houses. Around that age, they are taught by the fathers basic important skills such as fishing, building houses, making canoes or cutting and sewing sago palm leaves".
"Girls on the other hand, they stay with their mother and taught household cores such as cooking, weeding around the house, cleaning and looking after their younger brothers of sisters. One of the important things that girls learn at an early age too is how to make shell money".
Historically, chiefs in the Langalanga laggon are looked upon as very important in uniting communities. Normally, chiefs are chosen from chiefly tribes or clan. Villages in the past used to have threes chiefs, Fa'atabu who makes offering and communicated with the spirits and ancestors, the Ramo is responsible for tribal warfare and Waenotolo is the chief responsible for controlling, organising, leadership and uniting the whole community.
Priests in Laulasi live in "spirit houses," and when they die, their bodies are taken to the nearby village of Alite to decompose, after which the skulls are brought back and placed in a "house of skulls."
On the side of the island is an inlet where custom priests calls the sharks to come to the surface. The sharks are re-incarnation of the people's ancestors who died many years before. They also offer sacrifices to the sharks in the form of pigs. Ordinary men are not allowed to visit the shark site unless invited by the custom priest.
According to local legend, a fisherman whose boat capsizes at sea may call on a shark to rescue him; after being rescued and returned to shore, he must sacrifice a pig, or else the shark will eat him next time he goes out to sea.
By the 1960s many of the LangaLanga villages were Christian. Many of the communities previously sited on the artificial islands had been shifted to the mainland, with encouragement from the missionaries anxious to promote a clean break with the pagan past, and inducement in the form of greater access to land for subsistence farming.
Last Pagan priest.
In 1980, Moses Beogo who was the last Pagan priest (Fata'abu) on Laulasi and the last to perform the shark calling tradition, died. His skull is kept with the skulls of the other priests.
Tourism.
A report on the British Solomon Islands dated 1972 states:
"where the traditional process of making shell money and other island activities may be observed, once again proved popular with the tourists".
In 1981 a symposium in the then U.S.S.R heard of Solomon Islands that:
"One of the more successful ventures in the tourist industry is Laulasi Adventure Tours Ltd"
In 1982 a research paper by the Australian National University claimed:
"Laulasi has become one of the notable tourist attractions of the South Pacific – with all the predictable consequences for the integrity of the ancestoral religion and the fabric of community social life. Moreover, the expatriate entrepreneurs were Baha'is, and offered a ready-made religious accommodation between ancestors and capitalism".
In 1997 an author stated:
"Laulasi village, at the centre of the lagoon, makes a business of being nice to visitors. A real business, because it charges more than a Disneyland ticket to tread its man made shores".
In 2006 The Last Heathen by Charles Montgomery concludes that for this he was expecting to find a volatile mixture of the tribal, pagan religion and Christianity. He found a comfortable hybrid instead, the two religions living in harmony.
In November 2008 on an invitation from the Laulasi community a delegation from RAMSI was invited to attend to officiate the "re-opening" of the Laulasi Tourist Industry. Members took footage and photographs with a view of assisting with publicity. The delegation was escorted to the dock with a traditional war canoe trailing and a 10 seat war canoe leading with the latter being Laulasi women singing a traditional welcome song.
On arrival at the dock, warriors confronted the delegation until a sum of shell money was presented to the warriors as a sign of peace. Once this gift was received the village girls offered the delegation refreshments.
The men of the delegation were permitted to tour the three "apartments" that each represented a tribe. In each apartment, the skulls of past priests were laid atop one another. Once this tour concluded, the delegation was presented with a display of song and dance and formalities and a demonstration of the minting process of the shell money. The village women then sang as the delegation sailed away.
Boatbuilding.
The Annual Report on the British Solomon Islands dated 1953 states
"..a flourishing boat building industry has been established and cutters are being built for the inter-island trade. A boatbuilding school has been established.
Generally, the Lanagalanga people are very skilful boat builders. It can be said that it is unique to the constituency. In the early stages people used to build dingies. Later, with improvements in skills, they built what they referred to as 'CARTER BOATS' which is sharp at both ends. They used sails to travel around Malaita and to other Islands such as Gudalcanal and Isabel. Commercial boat building in the constituency started in the 1960s around the time when the Government established a boat building school in Auki. Mr. Frank Faulker who used to teach at the school and who now settled in Auki, is said to be the main person behind the success of the industry in Langalanga.
Shell Money.
The history of shell-money making in the langa langa lagoon is patchy. Stories retold from myths said that the first person to introduce shell money to the Langalanga lagoon was a woman from Buin in Bougainville. She was banish and floated in a coconut shell from Buin to Guadalcanal and finally to Malaita and landed at Tafilo a village at Lalana near Laulasi. Traditionally, there had been substantive trade between the Langalanga people and people from Buin in shell money until the emergence of the Bougainville crises. Most of the private ship owners from the constituency generated capital through shell money trade to build their ships. They took shell money to Buin and traded it for cash and used the cash to build wooden boats.
As the production rate increased, shell resources were depleted, particularly in Langalanga lagoon. Even in the 1970s some types of shell were rare.
Four different types of shell are used in making shell money, A red lipped rock oyster called Romu (chama pacifica), white shell known as Kee (Beguina semi-orbiculata), black horse mussel shells called Kurila (Atrina vexillum) and thick white disks from a rigid cockle known as Kakadu (Anadara granosa)
What makes this money valuable are the purple disks, whose number per string is carefully calculated and which are made from the lips of the Romu shell which the Langa Langa people collect twice a year from the lagoon areas of the clan of the Lau tribe. The chief of the Lau clan allows them to fish for the shells in exchange for half the money strings.

Aimed at global financial professionals, "Bloomberg Markets" publishes articles on the people and issues related to global financial markets. "Bloomberg Markets", which is based in New York City, has readers in 147 countries. More than half of its readers live outside the U.S. 
As of December 2011, the magazine had a circulation of 375,000 and was available for sale at bookstores and selected newsstands. All subscribers of the Bloomberg Professional service and the Bloomberg Terminal also receive "Bloomberg Markets" as part of their subscription. Newsstand sales averaged 6,154 in 2010.
History.
"Bloomberg Markets" was launched in July 1992 as ""Bloomberg: A Magazine for Bloomberg Users"" and was originally intended to be a guide for the Bloomberg Professional service. Although every issue included instructions for navigating terminal functions, content also included articles about financial markets aimed at portfolio managers, corporate executives, brokers, bankers and securities traders. William Inman served as "Bloomberg Markets" founding editor.
In 1999, the magazine became part of Bloomberg News and Ronald Henkoff became editor. Prior to joining "Bloomberg Markets", Henkoff worked as a reporter and editor at "Newsweek" and "Fortune". Henkoff was tapped by Bloomberg News chief Matt Winkler to bolster the magazine's feature writing, which had not been a focus of the publication. In 2000, the magazine's name was changed to "Bloomberg Markets" and became available on newsstands.
In fall 2010, "Bloomberg Markets" was redesigned in an effort to attract a broader array of advertisers and expand its content. The redesign, led by "Bloomberg Markets" editor Ronald Henkoff and publisher Michael Dukmejian and developed by the firm of Priest + Grace, gave the publication a new, more contemporary look. In April 2011, "Bloomberg Markets" hired its first creative director, Siung Tjia, the former creative director of ESPN The Magazine. In addition to design changes, the editors added regular coverage of careers and personal finance following a global survey of readers. 
In addition to the redesign, "Bloomberg Markets" unveiled a trade advertising campaign to position itself as the leading publication for the "global financial elite" and increase its circulation rate base from 355,000 to 375,000 by December 2011. The campaign and shift in design lead to new advertising deals with luxury brands such as Range Rover, Goldman Sachs and Allianz. The ultimate goal, according to Dukmejian, is for "Bloomberg Markets" to reach a circulation of 450,000 with 15,000 on newsstands.
In June 2011, "Bloomberg Markets" announced the launch of the 50 Most Influential franchise, its list of the most influential people in global finance, which appeared in the October 2011 issue. To coincide with the issue, the magazine hosted the inaugural Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit, a day-long event, held in September 2011 in New York City. A second 50 Most Influential ranking was published in the magazine's October 2012 issue. 
"Bloomberg Markets" will be testing a spin-off luxury title with a spring 2012 issue called "Bloomberg Pursuits".
Staff.
"Bloomberg Markets" has a staff of editors in the U.S., Latin America, Europe and Asia. In addition, the magazine draws on contributions from journalists at Bloomberg News, a global news service with 146 bureaus in 72 countries.
Honors and Awards.
"Bloomberg Markets" has won almost 200 journalism and design awards including a Gerald Loeb Award, a Scripps Howard Award and a George Polk Award. In 1995, the magazine was a finalist for the National Magazine Awards in the General Excellence category for magazines with a circulation under 100,000.
In 2006, editor Ron Henkoff won the Lawrence Minard Award as part of the Gerald Loeb Awards, which recognizes an editor whose career achievements and contributions the to profession of business, financial and economic journalism exemplify excellence in the area of editing.
In 2011, "Bloomberg Markets" was named a finalist for the American Society of Magazine Editor's General Excellence Award for Finance, Technology and Lifestyle Magazines and "Bloomberg Markets" senior writer David Evans was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist in the National Reporting category. Evans also received the 2011 John Chancellor Award given by Columbia Journalism School.
In 2012, "Bloomberg Markets" was made available in digital form for the iPad alongside its Business Week subscription circulation.
Notable stories and their impact.
"Duping The Families of Fallen Soldiers" (June 2010)
Following a six-month investigation, David Evans's article revealed that life insurance companies were withholding billions of dollars in benefits from the families of slain soldiers and millions of other Americans. As a result of the article, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs required that Prudential offer the families of slain soldiers the option of receiving one check for the full amount of the death benefit. Evans was named as a finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for his article.
"Toxic Debt" (July 2007)
This three-story cover package revealed the complicit role of rating companies Moody's and Standard and Poor's in creating the complex mortgage-backed securities stuffed with subprime debt that would trigger the global credit crisis. 
"Big Pharma's Shameful Secret" (December 2005)
The article revealed that poorly supervised clinical trials for potential new drugs often injure and kill participants. As a result of the magazine's expose, the largest clinical trial company in the U.S. ousted its three top managers and government authorities shut down its biggest test center. 
"The Banks That Fleeced Alabama" (September 2005)
"Bloomberg Markets" magazine reported that a group of banks led by JPMorgan Chase had overcharged Jefferson County, home to Birmingham, by at least $60 million in fees assessed on $5.8 billion in complex contracts called Interest-rate swaps that the county used to finance a sewer system. In October 2009, former Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford was convicted of taking bribes to steer a share of the JPMorgan deals to a local bank. As a result of the corruption, in November 2011, Jefferson County filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.

Charles Edward Faxon

Charles Edward Faxon (January 21, 1846 – February 6, 1918) was an American botanical artist and instructor of botany born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.
In 1867 he received his degree in civil engineering from Lawrence Scientific School in Cambridge. From 1879 to 1884, he taught classes in botany at the Bussey Institute.
Faxon was knowledgeable in regards to the flora of New England, and in 1882 joined the staff at the Arnold Arboretum. Here he took charge of development of the herbarium and library. He worked closely with Charles Sprague Sargent (1841-1927), the director of the arboretum.
Publications.
Faxon created 744 plates for illustration of Sargent's "Silva of North America". In addition to these drawings, he provided the illustrative work for the following publications by Sargent:

Appius Nicomachus Dexter

Appius Nicomachus Dexter ("floruit" before 432) was a politician of the Western Roman Empire.
Biography.
Dexter belonged to the "Nicomachi", an influential family of senatorial rank. Among his ancestors there was evidently Appius Claudius Tarronius Dexter; his grandfather was the praetorian prefect Virius Nicomachus Flavianus, his father might be identified with his relative Clementianus, while he was probably a nephew of Nicomachus Flavianus.
Continuing the tradition of his family (he claims to follow the example set by Clementianus), he edited a manuscript containing the first ten books of Livy' "Ab Urbe condita", initially corrected by some Victorinus, then bought by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, and finally emended by Nichomachus before arriving into the hands of Dexter; all of the manuscripts of the first ten books of Livy's "Ab Urbe condita" that were subsequently copied through the Middle Ages into modern times are derived by this single manuscript, thanks to whom those books have survived. Subscriptions with his name are found at the end of books 3, 4 and 5.
At the time of the praetorian prefecture of Nicomachus Flavianus (431-432) he set up a statue in honour of his grandfather Virius Nicomachus Flavianus, in which he styles himself former "praefectus urbi" of Rome.

Lude Check

Ludic Check (May 22, 1917 – May 11, 2009) was a professional hockey player who played for the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Black Hawks in the National Hockey League. After several years of hockey in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New York, Check was signed by the Montreal Canadiens after a season playing with the Quebec Senior Hockey League in 1943. In his first NHL season, he played only one professional game, with the Red Wings in 1944.
Check was then loaned to the Black Hawks, where he played 26 games in his final NHL season. The Canadiens then renewed his contract and sent him to the Ottawa "Senior" Senators of the Quebec Senior Hockey League, where he spent the last six seasons of his career. Check was a part of two Allan Cup-winning teams, in 1944 and 1949, and became a sales representative in later life. He died on May 11, 2009 in Ottawa, Ontario at the age of 91.
Early life.
Check was born in Brandon, Manitoba on May 22, 1917. Alongside Frank Stahan, Check played two seasons from 1936 through 1938 with the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League. He played two seasons for the Regina Aces (later renamed the Regina Vic-Aces) of the Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League from 1938 through 1940 before deciding to continue his career at the professional level. At the peak of his career, Check stood five feet, ten inches tall and weighed 165 pounds.
Hockey career.
After these teams Check, a left winger, spent a season with the New York Rovers of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. Although the team finished last, he nevertheless was responsible for 21 goals and 20 assists. This was followed by a year with the Sydney Millionaires of the Cape Breton Senior Hockey League, producing 29 goals and 22 assists.
During the 1942–1943 season, Check was signed by the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens, although he continued to play for the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Senior Hockey League through 1944, scoring for them a total of 60 goals and 40 assists. His only NHL game during this period was played with the Detroit Red Wings on March 11, 1944, when the Canadiens provided him as an emergency injury replacement, and he did not score any points. Check did, however, win his first Allan Cup while playing with the Aces, defeating the Port Arthur Shipbuilders in 1944. For the 1944-1945 season, he was loaned to the Chicago Black Hawks, playing 26 games and scoring six goals and two assists.
Check spent the rest of his career with the Ottawa "Senior" Senators of the QSHL, after having his contract re-purchased by the Canadiens and being loaned out. He competed in the Allan Cup twice more. In 1948 his team lost to the Edmonton Eskimos, but captured the championship in 1949 after facing off against the Regina Pats. In six seasons with the Senators, he scored a total of 81 goals and 84 assists, placing him among the top ten league scorers four times. He retired after the 1950–1951 season.
Later life.
After his hockey career, Check worked as a sales representative for the Hiram Walker distillery for over 30 years. He kept many friends from his hockey days in his later years, including Leo Gravelle, Emile Dagenais, Billy Robinson, Eddie Emberg and Larry Regan. Check died on May 11, 2009 at the age of 91 in Ottawa, Ontario. At the time of his death, he was one of the last surviving players from Ottawa's last Allan Cup championship team, the Senior Senators of 1949.

Species sorting

Species-sorting, is an approach that builds on theories of community change over environmental gradients and considers the effects of local abiotic features on population vital rates and species interactions. In this perspective, local patches are viewed as heterogeneous in some factors and the outcome of local species interactions depends on aspects of the abiotic environment. If different species can only inhabit exclusive habitat types, the resulting metacommunity can be broken down into two independent ones, but when individual species can inhabit multiple habitat types, there are a variety of outcomes that reflect how species interact at larger spatial scales. One way to model such dynamics is to extend assembly models to systems with multiple patch types. Like many patch dynamics models, this approach assumes that there is a separation of time scales between local population dynamics and colonization-extinction dynamics. Populations are assumed to go to their equilibrium behaviour (be it a stable point or a more complex oscillating or complex attractor) in between colonization events and before environmental perturbations that might cause extinctions to occur. This approach focuses on trade-offs among species that allow them to specialize on different patch types (local conditions) rather than on possible trade-offs between such traits and dispersal (as is found in the competition- colonization trade-off commonly found in patch dynamics models).
This species-sorting perspective has much in common with traditional theory about niche separation and coexistence. At larger spatial scales, however, metacommunity processes are important in allowing local community composition to track changes in the local environment (due to perturbations or gradual environmental change, for example) in ways that maintain the correspondence between local conditions and composition. Law & Leibold (In press) show how species-sorting models can have different dynamics in a metacommunity framework than in more conventional assembly models, one important difference is that metacommunity dynamics in cases with endpoint dynamics that consist of repeated cycles can be stabilized at the metacommunity scale. Shurin et al. (2003) show that alternate stable local communities are unlikely to occur in metacommunities unless they have sufficient environmental heterogeneity among patches. Metacommunity dynamics also constrain attributes of the regional biota in important ways that relate to ecological constraints at larger scales. The result is that species distributions are closely linked to local conditions and largely independent of unrelated purely spatial effects. Nevertheless, species sorting can still result in complex dynamics because of the possibility of cyclical assembly dynamics that are habitat-specific. In these situations communities go through assembly cycles that repeat themselves. One case that comes up in food web models is when a species from a low trophic level serves to assemble a food chain that is dependent on it and is excluded by competition with a competitor that has no resident consumers. The new basal species can then serve to assemble its own food chain that may be reciprocally invaded and excluded by the first species. Such food web assembly cycles involving species sorting (matching of prey to consumers and vice versa) appear in food web models of community assembly where their occurrence is enhanced by higher productivity.
Pond plankton appear to be a good example of such metacommunities. In metacommunities consisting of ponds in a biogeographically constrained region local communities appear to be highly resistant to invasion by absent species from the region unless there are significant perturbations. This would indicate that local communities have reached endpoint assembly configurations. On the other hand, even under unusually high immigration, species from other patch types seem to have very little influence on these local communities, indicating that local population dynamics are not strongly influenced by such mass effects (see below). Consequently there is good correspondence between local composition and local abiotic conditions even after sudden environmental changes have occurred.

<doc id="20202793" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20202793" title="Estate of Panic">
Estate of Panic

Estate of Panic is an American reality show in which seven strangers compete to find cash in a large estate. The show is hosted by Steve Valentine, and produced by Endemol USA. 
The first season aired on the Sci Fi Channel from November 12, 2008 to December 17, 2008, and has also aired on USA Network and the Chiller Network.
Premise.
Seven strangers from across the United States arrive at a large, mysterious mansion. The mansion's eccentric owner (Valentine) spends his free time stashing his assets throughout the mansion, and he is assisted by his silent butler, the eighty-year-old maniacal freak, Rupert. Once the players arrive at the estate, Valentine challenges them to find the cash he has hidden in a series of rooms. The task is made difficult, however, as the contestants must come face to face with their greatest phobias while in the house. In each room, the last person to leave and the person who collects the least money are both eliminated. After three rooms are explored and six players have been eliminated, the final contestant earns the opportunity to win (and add to) everything collected by all players by completing a final challenge in the estate's Vault.
Gameplay.
Main game.
The game is similar in concept to several other shows such as "Fear Factor" (also produced by Endemol), the Nickelodeon game show "Finders Keepers", the French game show "Fort Boyard", the British game show "The Crystal Maze", and the GSN game show "How Much Is Enough?" The seven contestants search through a series of three rooms for cash. Bills of smaller denominations ($1, $5, etc.) are hidden in relatively easy locations in the rooms, or even placed out in plain sight; bills of larger denominations (up to $100) are hidden in areas that are either more difficult to reach or protected by various animals (snakes, crabs, spiders, maggots, insects, etc.), all of which are harmless, yet disturbing. Meanwhile, each room takes on a life of its own to make things trickier and scarier for the contestants. For example, the basement floods with water; the study has moving walls and ceiling that "shrink" the room to a very small size; the floor in the kitchen has properties similar to quicksand, and the garden is rigged with electric fences.
Once a contestant believes that he or she has enough money to secure a spot in the next round, the player must leave the room and place all cash collected on a tray held by Rupert. Not all exits remain open the entire time, however, and a contestant might either have to wait for an exit to unlock or take an alternate route to make it out of the room in time.
Elimination.
While there is no explicitly-stated time limit in any of the rooms, the rooms become more uninhabitable as time passes and the number of players shrinks, forcing the players to consider when to exit. In each round, the last player left in the room is eliminated; the show claims that the contestant is "trapped" inside once all the others have exited. In addition: of the contestants who did exit, the one who recovered the least money is also eliminated and escorted from the house by the butler. Should there be a tie for last place, both players advance, but the "two" players with the least money in the next room are eliminated in addition to the trapped player.
There is no reward for recovering the most money in the first room, but the person who does so in the second room usually receives assistance that may prove useful in the third room. The total money recovered by all eliminated contestants is placed in a cumulative pot, which is then offered as a prize to the last remaining contestant.
Extras.
At times, a monetary bonus is offered to a contestant who can retrieve a certain object or set of objects hidden in one of the rooms. Depending on the object, it could either help or hinder the player's actual progress in the room: carrying some objects around could impede the player's progress, while setting them down would put them at risk of being stolen, with the others have the ability grab the rest without letting go. Other hidden objects could be worn to protect the player against some unwanted distraction(s) in the room (i.e. Rubber soled slippers, to protect against electric shocks).
The Vault.
The last remaining contestant is given the chance to win all the money recovered by all seven contestants, plus more, in the Vault.
The contestant is restrained (such as by a leg chain, a harness suspended from the ceiling, or a straitjacket) in a vault containing 200 "safety deposit boxes." Some boxes contain cash, while others have worthless items or booby traps such as snakes; a few boxes contain tools the contestant can use to free himself from the restraint. In some versions, the player must recover the prize winnings as well. Unlike the previous rooms, the Vault features a time limit: ten steel balls roll at intervals through a "timing device." Once eight balls have finished dropping, red lights begin flashing to warn the contestant; when all ten have finished dropping, the door locks. If the contestant exits the Vault before the door locks, he or she wins all the money collected that night, plus any money recovered from the Vault. If the door locks, he/she loses all of the money. As a last resort, the contestant can choose to "panic," pressing a button in the corner of the vault to summon Valentine to the rescue. Alternatively, if the contestant cannot physically reach the button, he/she may shout out, "I'm panicking," to the same effect; in earlier episodes, Valentine told the contestant to do both. A contestant who panics forfeits any money collected in the vault as well as half of the money collected in the first three rooms. While not specifically stated, it is implied that if the player tries to cheat by removing a ball, he/she will be disqualified. If the contestant makes it out of the Vault, the host states the amount of winnings, hands it to the contestant, and says "Get out of my house" as the episode concludes.
Production.
"Estate of Panic" is filmed on an estate in Argentina, although some challenges are filmed in a studio because, according to Valentine, "the scope of the challenges is so ambitious and huge that there were times when we couldn't really destroy that person's house." A disclaimer at the end of each episode notes that only one challenge is filmed per day, and the complete show is filmed over the course of four days.
Reaction.
Brian Lowry in "Variety" praised host Valentine's "macabre charm" but stated the show overall is a "parade of silly stunts and contests" which becomes "mostly an ordeal for viewers."

Skyland Camp-Bowman Lake Ranger Station

The Skyland Camp-Bowman Lake Ranger Station in Glacier National Park was originally built as the Culver Boys' Military Academy. The main building, known variously as the Skyland Camp Messhall, Culver Boys' Military Academy Messhall and Skyline Chalet, was built in 1920 and is a good example of National Park Service Rustic architecture. The main cabin, known as "Rainbow Lodge" was built by the boys of the academy in 1920 from red cedar logs, and is more elaborate and carefully detailed than typical ranger stations of this period. The interior is dominated by a stone fireplace.
The camp was originally owned by the Culver Military Academy of Culver, Indiana, which operated the camp as a concession within the park, on the shore of Bowman Lake. It operated for a few seasons, but poor management caused the National Park Service to terminate the camp's contract. With the camp falling into disrepair, the Park Service demolished all buildings except the Rainbow Lodge in 1940, rehabilitating the lodge for use as a ranger station. Two boathouses are included in the listed area, and many furnishings in the ranger station are contributing features.

Rex Townley

Reginald 'Rex' Colin Townley (15 April 1904—3 May 1982) was an Australian politician who served as leader of the Liberal Party in Tasmania from 1950 to 1956. He also played first-class cricket for the Tasmanian cricket team in his younger years.
Cricket career.
As Tasmania didn't compete in the Sheffield Shield at the time of his cricketing career, Townley's appearances for his state were limited to matches against touring sides such as the Marylebone Cricket Club and South Africa as well as out of season first-class fixtures against other Australian states. 
A legbreak bowler, Townley took 36 wickets at 35.52 in first-class matches. His claim to fame as a cricketer was dismissing Donald Bradman, caught and bowled for 369, in a first-class match against South Australia, the legendary batsman's second highest ever score at that level. He also claimed in his career the wickets of English Test cricketer Ernest Tyldesley and South African Test player Bruce Mitchell.
Political career.
Like his younger brother Athol, the Australian Minister for Defence from 1958 to 1963, Townley went into politics. He joined the Tasmanian House of Assembly at the 1946 election as an Independent, representing Denison. 
The Liberal Party installed Townley as their leader for the 1950 election but lost to incumbent Premier Robert Cosgrove, despite achieving a 9.8% swing. With the Liberals regaining two seats which had been held by Independents since 1948, Labor stayed in power only thanks to the support of the remaining Independent, Bill Wedd.
Townley also led the Liberals into the 1955 election and picked up a seat to leave the House of Assembly with a deadlock as both parties had 15 seats out of a possible 30 in the assembly. Cosgrove however remained as Premier of Tasmania.
On 30 June 1965, Townley resigned from parliament, having never failed to defend his seat in an election.

Langa Langa Lagoon

Langa Langa Lagoon or "Akwalaafu" is a natural lagoon on the West coast of Malaita near the provincial capital Auki within the Solomon Islands. The lagoon is 21 km in length and just under 1 km wide. The "lagoon people" or "salt water men" live on small artificial islands built up on sand bars over time where they were forced to flee from the headhunters of mainland Malaita. 
The islands in the lagoon are renowned for their shell money minting process, their "shark worship" beliefs, their shipbuilding skills and tourism. The most popular and well known of this islands is Laulasi which has had a thriving tourism industry dating back to the early 1970s.
Etymology.
"Langa" in the Creole language means "along" or long.
History.
In Malaita legend, the first settlement on the island began around 3,000 BC at a place called Siale. The first places in the Malaita area to be settled were "Dukwasi" (Kwara'ae speaking people), and the "Asi" (man-made islands) namely: Aoke, Kaloka and Rarata in Langa Langa lagoon, Laulasi, Alite Koalia and Gwa'ata – Ta'alulolo.
It is also believed the early settlers originated from Mt. Kolovrat (Alasa'a),the highest peak on the main Malaita Island. The early settlers were believed to be castaways from the Alasa'a community. They said, the people were forced out from the community because of bad behaviour and disrespect for custom and traditional way of living.
During their journey the final stopover was at Laulasi where they felt it was safe from enemies. After they had settled, other people began to arrive from different parts of Malaita and outside to settle in the Langalanga lagoon. They came from Small Malaita, Florida (Ngella), some came from the northern part of Guadalcanal believed to be from Longuvalasi area and others from the northern region of Malaita. Through inter-marriages, their descendants spread to the whole of the Langalanga lagoon. Certain cultural features or "Tambu House" (Place of the first settlements) are still preserved which attest to the settlement patterns that were made.
1800–1900.
In 1892 the Queensland government Australia abandoned the Pacific labour trade known as Blackbirding and in 1901 the Commonwealth of Australia enacted the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 which facilitated the deportation of Pacific Islanders that was the precursor to the White Australia policy.
Britain was provided with a "plausible excuse for protecting the Solomons" and so protecting their labour reserves. By declaring a protectorate, the British were able to justify keeping out other colonial powers.
In 1893 then Gibson of HMS Curacoa (1854) sailed around the islands to declare a protectorate with the only opposition by the Laulasi villagers who refused the British flag. When Gibson asked why the flag was refused, the villages were afraid that their acceptance of it would signify to the bush people that by aligning themselves with Britain the lagoon dwellers were preparing for war and this would lead the bush people discontinuing trade with the lagoon people, who had no gardens and were dependent on food
1911 – Author Jack London.
American author Jack London traveled to Langa Langa in a yacht in 1907.
"We ran down the lagoon from Langa Langa, between mangrove swamps through passages scaresly wider than the Monota, and passed the reef villages of Kaloka and Auki. Like the founders of Venice, these salt water men were originally refugees form the mainland. Too weak to hold their own in the bush, survivors of village massacres, they fled to the sand banks of the lagoon. These sand banks they built up into islands and they were compelled to seek their provender from the sea. They developed canoo bodies, unable to walk about, spending all their time in the canoos, they became thick armed and broad shouldered with narrow waists and frail legs" (p 138)
"I sailed in the teak-built ketch, the Minota, on a blackbirding cruise to Malaita, and I took my wife along. The hatchet-marks were still raw on the door of our tiny stateroom advertising an event of a few months before. The event was the taking of Captain Mackenzie's head, Captain Mackenzie, at that time, being master of the Minota... As we sailed in to Langa-Langa on the shore side of the lagoon, was Binu, the place where the Minota was captured a year previously and her captain killed by the bushmen of Malaita, having been hacked to pieces and eaten" (p 135)
"He(Mackenzie) believed in kindness. He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons. On his second trip to Malaita, recruiting,he ran into Bina, which is near Langa Langa. The rifles with which the boat's-crew should have been armed, were locked up in his cabin. When the whale-boat went ashore after recruits, he paraded around the deck without even a revolver on him. He was tomahawked. His head remains in Malaita. It was suicide.
The Log of the Snark states:
"..still bore the tomahawk marks where the Malaitans at Langa Langa several months before broke in for the trove of rifles and ammunition locked therein, after bloodily slaughtering Jansen's predecessor, Captain Mackenzie. The burning of the vessel was somehow prevented by the black crew, but this was so unprecedented that the owner feared some complicity between them and the attacking party. However, it could not be proved, and we sailed with the majority of this same crew. The present skipper smilingly warned us that the same tribe still required two more heads from the Minota, to square up for deaths on the Ysabel plantation. (p 387)
"Three fruitless days were spent at Su'u. The Minota got no recruits from the bush and the bushmen got no heads from the Minota. We towed out with a whaleboat and ran along the coast to Langa Langa, a large village of salt-water people built with labour on a sand bank – literally built up"
World War 2.
The island of Laulasi was the subject of the worst civilian casualties in the Solomon Islands during a bombing raid by American bombers during World War II.
Cultural Practices and Beliefs.
The LangaLanga/Wala and Kwara'ae people more or less have the same cultural and traditional practices and follow the same chiefly system. Male children for example are more valued than females because they will continue with the line or tribe. Girls are not so preferred because they leave the community when they get married. Boys are separated from their parents when they are around 12 or 13 years old to live separate in the men's houses. Around that age, they are taught by the fathers basic important skills such as fishing, building houses, making canoes or cutting and sewing sago palm leaves.
Girls on the other hand, they stay with their mother and taught household cores such as cooking, weeding around the house, cleaning and looking after their younger brothers of sisters. One of the important things that girls learn at an early age too is how to make shell money.
Historically, chiefs in the Langalanga laggon are looked upon as very important in uniting communities. Normally, chiefs are chosen from chiefly tribes or clan. Villages in the past used to have threes chiefs, Fa'atabu who makes offering and communicated with the spirits and ancestors, the Ramo is responsible for tribal warfare and Waenotolo is the chief responsible for controlling, organising, leadership and uniting the whole community.
Priests in Laulasi live in "spirit houses," and when they die, their bodies are taken to the nearby village of Alite to decompose, after which the skulls are brought back and placed in a "house of skulls."
On the side of the island is an inlet where custom priests calls the sharks to come to the surface. The sharks are re-incarnation of the people's ancestors who died many years before. They also offer sacrifices to the sharks in the form of pigs. Ordinary men are not allowed to visit the shark site unless invited by the custom priest.
According to local legend, a fisherman whose boat capsizes at sea may call on a shark to rescue him; after being rescued and returned to shore, he must sacrifice a pig, or else the shark will eat him next time he goes out to sea.
By the 1960s many of the LangaLanga villages were Christian. Many of the communities previously sited on the artificial islands had been shifted to the mainland, with encouragement from the missionaries anxious to promote a clean break with the pagan past, and inducement in the form of greater access to land for subsistence farming.
Economy.
Traditionally, there had been substantive trade between the Langalanga people and people from Buin (Bougainville) in shell money until the emergence of the Bougainville crisis. Most of the private ship owners from the constituency generated capital through shell money trade to build their ships. They took shell money to Buin and traded it for cash and used the cash to build wooden boats.
Until recently, it has been a driving business which can be conservatively valued at $50,000.00 to $100,000.00 per annum. Shell money products include bracelets, necklaces, Tafuliae, Ha'a (smaller beads shell money used in some parts of the country), ear rings, finger ring, 'head bands' etc.
At present, unfortunately, the industry is slowly declining due to input scarcity. The major supplier of raw material South Malaita is not willing to supply any more shells. The only supplier which still sell raw materials to Langalanga people is Western Province although not reliable and in very small quantity.
Shell money.
The history of shell-money making in the Langa Langa lagoon is patchy. Stories retold from myths said that the first person to introduce shell money to the Langalanga lagoon was a woman from Buin in Bougainville. She was banished and floated in a coconut shell from Buin to Guadalcanal and finally to Malaita and landed at Tafilo, a village at Lalana near Laulasi. Traditionally, there had been substantive trade between the Langalanga people and people from Buin in shell money until the emergence of the Bougainville crises. Most of the private ship owners from the constituency generated capital through shell money trade to build their ships. They took shell money to Buin and traded it for cash and used the cash to build wooden boats.
As the production rate increased, shell resources were depleted, particularly in Langalanga lagoon. Even in the 1970s some types of shell were rare.
Four different types of shell are used in making shell money, A red lipped rock oyster known as "romu" ("Chama pacifica in the family Chamidae"), white shell known as "kee" ("Beguina semiorbiculata" in the Carditidae), black horse mussel shells called "kurila" ("Atrina vexillum" in the Pinnidae) and thick white disks from a rigid cockle known as "kakadu" ("Anadara granosa" in the Arcidae)
Boatbuilding.
The Annual Report on the British Solomon Islands dated 1953 states
"..a flourishing boat building industry has been established and cutters are being built for the inter-island trade. A boatbuilding school has been established.
Generally, the Lanagalanga people are very skilful boat builders. It can be said that it is unique to the constituency. In the early stages people used to build dingies. Later, with improvements in skills, they built what they referred to as "Carter boats" which are sharp at both ends. They used sails to travel around Malaita and to other Islands such as Guadalcanal and Isabel. Commercial boat building in the constituency started in the 1960s around the time when the Government established a boat building school in Auki. Mr. Frank Faulker who used to teach at the school and who now settled in Auki, is said to be the main person behind the success of the industry in Langalanga.

Cherokee is a small town situated in the Macedon Ranges Shire, in Victoria, Australia north of the state capital, Melbourne.
The settlement as it appears today was created by land subdivision around 1880–1881, although the area was occupied by Europeans before this date. Timber mills and a school were operating by 1865, possibly earlier, in response to the demand for timber created by the Victorian gold rush.
Cherokee Post Office opened on 1 July 1927 and closed in 1955.

Deutsches Turn- und Sportfest 1938

The Deutsches Turn- und Sportfest (German Gym and Sports Celebration) was the last big sports event organized by the Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen, the Sports governing body of the Third Reich. It took place in Breslau (now Wroclaw) the most important city of Silesia, now in Poland. The venue was staged in July 1938 at the city's "", later renamed """", following the trademark grandiose style of the Nazi Sports Body.
This highly nationalistic sports event was officially commemorating the 125th anniversary of the historical German Wars of Liberation against Napoleon and the first award of the Iron Cross in the city of Breslau itself in 1813. It was staged as a grand patriotic, expansionist occasion, illustrating the clamor for a Greater Germany to the public. This event gathered German athletes brought from many different parts of the world, like Argentina, South West Africa, Italy, the USA and South Africa. It also became a gathering of representatives of German ethnic minorities, mainly from Eastern Europe (Siebenbürgen, Banat) who staged processions dressed in their colorful folkloric costumes, a display of the Nazi Drang nach Osten policies.
Not only sports competitions and athletes' parades took place, but also numerous military, civil, and folklorical-costume processions in the mains streets of the city of Breslau.
Symbolism of the event.
The Deutsches Turn- und Sportfest was a highly political event, attended by many high-ranking Nazi officials.
The event was presided over by "Reichssportführer" (NSRL leader) Hans von Tschammer und Osten and the patron of the festival, Reich minister of the interior Wilhelm Frick. Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking personalities of the Third Reich attended the inaugural venue of the games. During this occasion Hitler gave a speech from the balcony of Hotel Monopol in Breslau.
The event and its celebration of Germanism, as well as the choice of Dr. Wilhelm Frick to lead it, was part of the creation of a war-preparation atmosphere by the Nazi state. Minister of the Interior Frick was the spearheader of Germany's rearmament in violation of the Versailles Treaty. His inaugural speech was full of war symbolism, setting the mood for the events that would culminate the following year with the invasion of nearby Poland, then just a few miles to the east of Breslau.
Viciously attacked and fanatically defended, the city of Breslau would suffer much destruction towards the end of World War II.
Commemorative editions.
The Post Office of the Reich issued special stamps and postcards to mark the occasion of the 1939 Breslau Games.
"Volk in Leibesübungen" (A people into Physical Exercise), a lavishly illustrated commemorative book on the Sportfest was published in Berlin the same year on behalf of the "Reichssportführer" Hans von Tschammer und Osten. The pictures of this volume were made by Heinrich Hoffman, Hitler's personal photographer.

Capitol Theatre (New York City)

The Capitol Theatre was a movie palace located at 1645 Broadway, just north of Times Square in New York City, across from the Winter Garden Theatre. Designed by Thomas W. Lamb, the Capitol seated 4000 and opened October 24, 1919. It was one of the first of the large lavish movie theaters that dominated the film exhibition business for the next 40 years. The theater was acquired in 1924 by the entertainment magnate Marcus Loew and became the flagship of his deluxe Loew's Theatres chain. 
The Capitol was the frequent site of the world premieres of films made by the Loew's-owned Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio. It is remembered as the theatre at which the classic 1939 film "The Wizard of Oz" had its first New York run. The Times Square landmark was replaced by the Paramount Plaza office tower.
Radio.
Radio programs were broadcast from the Capitol Theatre as early as 1923. Leo Zeitlin (1884-1930) was a violinist, violist, conductor and impresario who was active in Saint Petersburg's Society for Jewish Folk Music. In 1923, he emigrated to New York, where he became the violist and arranger for the Capitol Theatre. In 1925, he began arranging orchestral and small ensemble pieces for the Capitol's radio program on WEAF, which became the flagship station of the NBC Red Network in 1926. 
Beginning in 1926, the series of light classical concerts titled "Capitol Theatre" was broadcast by the NBC Red Network on Sunday evenings from 7:20pm to 9:15pm. This series continued until 1929, not long before Zeitlin's death.

Balitung

Sri Maharaja Rakai Watukura Dyah Balitung Sri Dharmodaya Mahasambu was the king of the Kingdom of Mataram. He reigned circa 899–911. His territories included Central Java, East Java, and Bali. In 907 he edicted the Mantyasih inscription (also known as Balitung's charter), containing the list of Medang kings.
Origin.
Historians such as Boechari and Poerbatjaraka argued that Dyah Balitung became the king as a result of his marriage to the daughter of his predecessor. It was speculated that his predecessor and his father-in-law is Rakai Watuhumalang who according to the stele of Mantyasih ruled before Balitung.
However, the reason Balitung inherited the kingdom might not be that of marrying the King's daughter, since he also had a son, Mpu Daksa according to the stele of Telahap. Other reason that after Rakai Kayuwangi's death, the kingdom is broken. This is confirmed with Maharaja Rakai Gurunwangi's stele of Munggu Antan and Rakai Limus Dyah Dewendra's stele of Poh Dulur.
It can be speculated that Dyah Balitung, the son-in-law of Rakai Watuhumalang, who in turn the successor of Rakai Kayuwangi, become a hero by defeating Rakai Gurunwangi and Rakai Limus, and thus uniting the divided kingdoms. As a result, the people elected Balitung as King in favour of his brother-in-law, Mpu Daksa.
Balitung's Era.
During his rule, the palace was moved to Poh Pitu area and named Yawapura. The move is speculated because of the former palace, Mamratipura, built by Rakai Pikatan was badly damaged as a result of war between Rakai Kayuwangi and Rakai Gurunwangi.
The oldest stele under the name of Balitung is the stele of Telahap, dated 11 September 899. However, this does not means it is his first stele, as it is possible he ascended the throne even before 899. The next stele is Watukura, dated 27 July 902. This is the oldest stele that stated the existence of the position of "Rakryan Kanuruhan" (Prime Minister). Meanwhile, the position of Rakryan Mapatih in Balitung's era is equivalent that of a crown prince, held by Mpu Daksa.
The stele of Telang, dated 11 January 904 revealed the development of a complex named Paparahuan which was led by Rakai Welar Mpu Sudarsana, located on the verge of Bengawan Solo river. Balitung freed the villages in Paparahuan and its surrounding off tax, and forbid the local inhabitants to collect payment from people who crossed the river. The stele of Poh, (17 July 905) revealed that village Poh is freed from tax in returns of taking care of "Sang Hyang Caitya" and "Silunglung", properties of the previous ruler Rakai Pikatan, the grandfather of Mpu Daksa and Balitung's consort.
The stele of Kubu-Kubu (17 October 905) revealed the gift given to Rakryan Hujung Dyah Mangarak and Rakryan Matuha Dyah Majawuntan in form of a village, Kubu-Kubu, as they both conquered Bantan area. Historians speculated that Bantan might be an alternative name to Bali. Bantan means "sacrifice", while Bali means "offering"
The stele of Mantyaish (11 April 907) revealed the gift given to five junior "patih"s because they maintained peace during Balitung's wedding. Also mentioned in this stele, the previous ruler of the kingdom before Balitung. Also in year 907, Balitung offers the village Rukam to his grandmother, Rakryan Sanjiwana.
The end of an era.
The accession of Balitung as king might caused the previous king's son, Mpu Daksa became jealous. During the rule of his brother-in-law, Mpu Daksa held the position as Rakai Hino as found written on a stele which dated 21 December 910 about the partition of Taji Gunung area between him and Rakai Gurunwangi. According to the stele of Plaosan, Rakai Gurunwangi is speculated as the son of Rakai Pikatan.
Historians speculated that Rakai Gurunwangi allied himself with Mpu Daksa, his nephew as they are the son and grandson of Rakai Pikatan respectively.
Historian Boechari is certain that the rule of Balitung ended as a result of Mpu Daksa's rebellion. According to stele of Taji Gunung (910), Daksa was still as Rakai Hino, while in the stele of Timbangan Wungkal (913), he already ascended the throne as king.

Balmacara Square

Balmacara Square () is a small village, close to Balmacara, in Lochlash, Scottish Highlands and is in the council area of Highland. 
Balmacara Square was traditionally the centre of the Balmacara Estate, some in size, with a number of crofts, farmhouses and a steading being built, until it gradually developed to over 40 households. In 1946, the village was bequeathed to the National Trust for Scotland. It recently underwent extensive renovation which is still continuing.

Donald Greene

Donald Johnson Greene (November 21, 1914 – 1997) was a literary critic, English professor, and scholar of British literature, particularly the eighteenth-century period. Known especially for his work on Samuel Johnson, he also wrote on later authors such as Jane Austen, Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, and Donald Davie.
Greene was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada. He began teaching in rural elementary schools and was a non-degreed teacher in Saskatchewan and Alberta. World War II interrupted his academic pursuits; from 1941 to 1945 Greene was a lieutenant and captain in the Royal Canadian Artillery. Following the war he received a graduate fellowship from the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, and he received his M.A. in 1948 at the University College, London. He twice received a Guggenheim Fellowship, in 1957 and 1979.
Greene had achieved a considerable scholarly contribution even before graduating, with commentary on Samuel Johnson appearing in "Notes and Queries", "PMLA", "Modern Language Notes", and the "Review of English Studies". Later, he was the editor of "Eighteenth-Century Studies" and "Johnsonian News Letter", along with holding the position as president of the Johnson Society and served on the board of directors for the Johnson Society of Southern California. 
He taught at the University of Saskatchewan beginning in 1948 and in 1952 he began Ph.D. studies in Columbia University's English department, whose faculty included James L. Clifford—another Samuel Johnson specialist—and Marjorie Hope Nicolson. Greene taught at least six other universities, including Brandeis University, the University of California at Riverside, the University of New Mexico, the University of Toronto, and the University of Wisconsin. He ended his career as Leo S. Bing Professor of English at the University of Southern California from 1968 to 1984.

New Yam Festival of the Igbo

The New Yam festival of the Igbo (, depending on dialect) is an annual harvest festival by the Igbo people held at the end of the rainy season in early August. The Iwa ji festival (literally ""new-yam eating"") is practiced throughout West Africa (especially in Nigeria and Ghana) and other African countries and beyond, symbolizing the conclusion of a harvest and the beginning of the next work cycle. The celebration is a very culturally based occasion, tying individual Igbo communities together as essentially agrarian and dependent on yam. 
Yams are the first crop to be harvested, and are the most important crop of the region. The evening prior to the day of the festival, all old yams (from the previous year's crop) are consumed or discarded. The next day, only dishes of yam are served, as the festival is symbolic of the abundance of the produce.
Traditionally, the role of eating the first yam is performed by the oldest man in the community or the king ("igwe"). This man also offers the yams to god, deities and ancestors. It is believed that their position bestows the privilege of being intermediaries between their communities and the gods of the land. The rituals are meant to express the gratitude of the community to the gods for making the harvest possible, and they are widely followed despite more modern changes due to the influence of Christianity in the area.
The day is symbolic of enjoyment after the cultivation season, and the plenty is shared with friends and well-wishers. A variety of festivities mark the eating of new yam. Folk dances, masquerades, parades, and parties create an experience that some participants characterize as "art"; the colorful festival is a spectacle of exhibited joy, thanks, and community display.
Palm oil ("mmanu nri") is used to eat the yam. Iwa ji also shares some similarities with the Asian Mid-Autumn Festival, as both are based on the cycles of the moon and are essentially community harvest festivals.

Controversy.
On 8 November 2008, after coming off air from a weekday afternoon show, Mason was suspended by BBC Radio Bristol following an incident in which she made allegedly racist remarks made in an off-air phone conversation during a weekday afternoon show. Whilst phoning a taxi firm in order to send her 14-year-old daughter from Mason's Clifton home to her grandparents' home, she was said to have asked the company not to send an Asian driver. The day after her suspension, Mason was told by the BBC that she would no longer be working for the Corporation. The phone call was illegally recorded by an operator for "Streamline Black & White" and sent to "The Sun". The taxi company says the operator has since been sacked.
Mason was previously convicted in 2003 and 2004 of speeding and public order offences, whilst battling alcohol addiction.

Van Brederode

The lords of Van Brederode were a noble family from Holland who played an important role during the Middle Ages. The earliest documented members appear in the 13th century in the region of Santpoort, at Castle Brederode.
History.
They were closely descended from the Counts of Holland and the powerful Van Teylingen family (see Slot Teylingen, about halfway between Haarlem and Leiden). Dirk I van Brederode, also called "Dirk van Teylingen", built the Brederode castle.
During the Protestant Reformation the Van Brederode family left Holland and their properties were confiscated by the government. Their descendants sued the government, but when the decision came in their favor the family line had died out (the last known descendant lived in the 17th century). The debt to the unknown heirs is still on the Netherlands State Budget ("Nederlandse staatsbegroting"). Currently the Dutch monarch is entitled to the interest of the capital (Queen Wilhelmina was the first to be entitled to this money). In 1967 the sum was said to be around 3.000 million Dutch guilders.

Khazen

Khazen (also "El Khazen" in some cases Al Khazen or De Khazen, Arabic: الخازن) is the name of a prominent Noble Levantine family based in Keserwan District, Lebanon, Damascus, Syria, Nablus, Palestine as well as other districts around the Levant. The Khazen family have traced their lineage through DNA testing to Jericho, Palestine also known as Tell el-Sultan 8500 B.C. Several members have played leading roles in politics for many generations. French King Louis XIV elevated the family to the French nobility and referred to them as the Prince of the Maronites in many letters. Most of the Lebanese Khazen branch are Maronites, while the Syrian and Palestinian Khazen branch are mostly Muslim. There is also a Saudi Khazen branch.
History.
The Khazen Cheikhs can trace back their lineage heritage to the 9th century where they were mainly located between Houran, Damascus, Baalbeck and Nablus. They have started buying and acquiring lands in Mount Lebanon during the 1400 era and more specifically first in "Jaj" currently under Jbeil district. They continued their exodus to the Keserwan district where they have bought lands from the Chi'a Tribes. This has caused the Chi'a to move towards what is known today the South of Lebanon and this has brought the Maronites to the Keserwan district.
In 1584, the Khazen were able to hide the princes Fakhreddine and Youness in Ballouneh. At that time, their father, cornered by the Ottoman's army and losing the fight against them, informed his wife Sitt Nossab to send his sons to the Khazen Family a powerful and influential family at that time. The great Fakhredine when he took power, was greatly influenced by the Khazen family politically and religiously. In return granted them the title of "cheikh" and complete political influence and control of Mount Lebanon.
The Khazen families who were now controlling the Kerserwan district were very influential with the Maronite Church. Mainly this is due because of their financial support to the Church and also helping the expansion of the Church by the construction of many monasteries. They have also offered lands and most importantly supplied security to the Church and the Maronite community overall. In 1656 Cheikh Abou-Nawfal received a Papal decoration for his help and expansion of the Maronite faith in Mount Lebanon on behalf of the pope himself and the Catholic faith. The family under their newly granted rights were able to nominate three Maronite archbishops representing the districts of Baalbeck, Damas and Aleppo until the revolution against them in 1858. There were three important and influential patriarchs from the Khazen family: Youssef Dargham (1733–1742), Toubia (1756–1766) and Youssef Ragi (1845–1854) and seven archbishops.
In 1858 Tanios Chahine led a rebellion against the Khazen family, which caused a great loss to the family's dominance over the Kerserwan District. The rebellion was a result of a power struggle; from one side the AbiLamaa family, England next to the Ottoman Empire and from the other the Khazen's who wanted to increase their influence. After these events the Khazen stayed involved in politics yet their work as one family holding the ultimate Maronite power has diminished greatly. In modern history they have always represented Keserwan by one Parliament Member and in some cases two. They have also been represented in many recent governments, where they have held the Interior Ministry and the Ministry of Tourism.

<doc id="20203716" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20203716" title="Fomalhaut b">
Fomalhaut b

Fomalhaut b is a confirmed, directly-imaged extrasolar object and candidate planet orbiting the A-type main-sequence star Fomalhaut, approximately 25 light-years away in the constellation of Piscis Austrinus. The object was initially announced in 2008 and confirmed as real in 2012 from images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope and, according to calculations reported in January 2013, has a 2,000-year highly elliptical orbit. It has a periastron of 7.4 billion km (~50 AU) and an apastron of about 44 billion km (~300 AU). As of May 25, 2013 it is 110 AU from its parent star.
Summary.
The nature of Fomalhaut b became unsettled after its discovery. Fomalhaut b could be a conglomeration of rubble from a recent collision between comet-to-asteroid sized bodies and not actually identify a planet. Although this scenario is possible, the likelihood of observing such a collision at the location of Fomalhaut b is extremely low. Instead, Fomalhaut b is plausibly, even likely, a planet less than twice Jupiter's mass that is either enshrouded in a spherical cloud of dust from ongoing planetesimal collisions or surrounded by a large circumplanetary ring system, either of which are responsible for scattering the primary star's light and thus making Fomalhaut b visible.
Fomalhaut b and three companions around HR 8799, whose discovery was announced simultaneously, were described as the first directly-imaged extrasolar planets in that their emission was thought to originate at least in part from a planetary atmosphere. However, subsequent studies from the Spitzer Space Telescope and a reanalysis of the original HST data 
instead suggest that Fomalhaut b's light is scattered starlight, not planet thermal emission.
Initial discovery by Hubble.
The existence of a massive planet orbiting Fomalhaut was first inferred from Hubble observations published in 2005 that resolved the structure of Fomalhaut's massive, cold debris disk (or dust belt/ring). The belt is not centered on the star, and has a sharper inner boundary than would normally be expected. A massive planet on a wide orbit but located interior to this debris ring could clear out parent bodies and dust in its vicinity, leaving the ring appearing to have a sharp inner edge and making it appear offset from the star.
In May 2008, Paul Kalas and James Graham identified Fomalhaut b from Hubble/ACS images taken in 2004 and 2006 at visible wavelengths (i.e. 0.6 and 0.8 µm). NASA released the composite discovery photograph on November 13, 2008, coinciding with the publication of Kalas and Graham's discovery in Science.
Kalas remarked, "It’s a profound and overwhelming experience to lay eyes on a planet never before seen. I nearly had a heart attack at the end of May when I confirmed that Fomalhaut b orbits its parent star." In the image, the bright outer oval band is the dust ring, while the features inside of this band represent noise from scattered starlight.
Early follow-up observations and doubts about Fomalhaut b.
In the discovery paper, Kalas and Graham suggested that Fomalhaut b's emission originates from two sources: from circumplanetary dust scattering starlight and from planet thermal emission. Here, the former explains most of the 0.6 µm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8 µm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.
However, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in the space-based infrared data in this scenario. But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b does identify emission from a planet atmosphere. Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, the measurements in Kalas and Graham's paper implied it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work. Finally, researchers analyzing September–October 2011 Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring is shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b. These results lead to serious doubts about Fomalhaut b's claimed properties, its status as a planet and even its existence.
Recovery/independent confirmation with Hubble and further controversy.
On October 24, 2012, a team lead by Thayne Currie at the University of Toronto announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet. They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4 µm.
Their analysis showed that Fomalhaut b was unlikely to have been detected in the infrared anyway and yielded a velocity for Fomalhaut b smaller than that derived in the discovery paper and consistent with that needed for Fomalhaut b to be a planet sculpting the debris ring. They modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object. Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a “planet identified from direct imaging” even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.
A second paper made public later and lead by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the Herzberg Institute for Astrophysics also independently recover Fomalhaut b and confirm the new 0.4 µm detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They consider two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50 km.
The revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a “zombie planet”, although this is a non-technical term that does not appear in any paper.
Physical characteristics.
Assuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits Fomalhaut at a distance of approximately . This distance is about closer to the star than the inner edge of the debris disk. The orbital separation of Fomalhaut b is larger than that for directly imaged planets around beta Pictoris and HR 8799 (8-70 AU). Fomalhaut b appears to be moving at about 4 kilometers per second. It is unclear whether Fomalhaut b's orbit will make it cross the debris disk, cross the debris disk only in projection (i.e. it is not orbiting in the same plane as the disk), or whether its orbit is completely nested within the debris disk.
At the optical wavelengths at which Fomalhaut b is detected, it is only about 2.7×10−10 times as bright as the star and is the faintest (intrinsically) extrasolar object yet imaged. The shape of its spectrum, as determined from measurements obtained at 0.4 to 0.8 µm, appears similar to that of its host star, suggesting that the emission identifying Fomalhaut b is completely due to scattered starlight. Although the initial discovery paper for Fomalhaut b suggested that its optical brightness may be variable due to planetary accretion, later reanalyses of these data fail to find convincing evidence that Fomalhaut b is indeed variable, thus eliminating evidence for planetary accretion and also for a 'transient' dust cloud.
In order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet, a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planet atmosphere. A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 to 40 times that of Jupiter's radius. A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of can make Fomalhaut b visible. Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6 µm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth-Sun distance. However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths, indicating that its emitting area is larger.
The mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain. Infrared non-detections suggest that Fomalhaut b cannot be more massive than 2 times Jupiter's mass but a lower limit on the mass depends on uncertain details for the nature of Fomalhaut b, its circumplanetary environment, and the existence of other planet-mass bodies in the system. Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting Fomalhaut's debris disk identify 0.5 times Jupiter's mass as a plausible estimate. Models for Fomalhaut b assuming it is surrounded by a swarm of planetesimals imply that it could be much lower mass (10-100 times the mass of the Earth). If Fomalhaut b is instead one of two shepherding planets which together confine the debris disk into a narrow ring, it could be anywhere between several times the mass of Mars to slightly more massive than the Earth.
If Fomalhaut b is a gas giant planet like Jupiter or Saturn, it probably formed several million years after the host star itself was formed, making it roughly 450 million years old. Alternatively, if it is a transient dust cloud it must be extremely young, perhaps created within the last few centuries.
Other planets orbiting Fomalhaut.
Fomalhaut b is orbiting its host star at a wide separation, where forming massive planets is difficult. To explain its current location, Fomalhaut b could have been dynamically scattered by a more massive, unseen body located at smaller separations. Several ground-based observations have searched for this hypothetical Fomalhaut “c” but have yet to find it. At very small, Solar-System-like scales any additional companions must have a mass less than thirteen times the mass of Jupiter. At slightly wider scales comparable to the locations of planets around HR 8799, any additional planets must have masses below about 2 to 7 Jupiter masses. Fomalhaut b could have formed in situ if it coalesced from small pebble-sized objects that rapidly formed into a protoplanetary core which in turn accreted a gaseous envelope.

Coal Creek Patrol Cabin

The Coal Creek Patrol Cabin in Glacier National Park, Montana, is a rustic backcountry log cabin. Built in 1925, the cabin has a single room with a board floor and a small cellar for a food cache. The cabin was used by rangers on patrol routes from the Nyack and Paola ranger stations.
The cabin is notable for its original roof construction, which consisted of peeled logs laid along the pitch of the roof, culminating in a log ridgepole. The added weight was borne by double log purlins, one on top of the other. The configuration was apparently intended to protect against deadfalls, falling trees or branches. The logs were replaced by shingles in the 1940s and by metal in the 1960s. While the Paola ranger station was abandoned in 1932, as well as the Nyack station, the Coal Creek cabin is maintained and used by trail maintenance crews.

Jason Smith (American football)

Jason Kyle Smith (born April 30, 1986) is an American football offensive tackle who is currently a free agent. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams with the second overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at Baylor University.
High school career.
Smith attended W. T. White High School, in Dallas, Texas. He was a First-team All-District honors as a sophomore and junior as an offensive tackle. As a senior he was moved to tight end, catching seven passes for 101 yards and one touchdown. He was rewarded with All-District honors as a senior.
At 6′5″ and Smith did not have ideal size and was only considered a two-star prospect by "Rivals.com". He drew few scholarship offers and committed to Baylor on the same day that he received his offer.
College career.
After redshirting his first season at Baylor, Smith played tight end in 2005, appearing in 11 games, starting eight. He caught 6 passes for 70 yards and one touchdown. As a sophomore in 2006, he was moved to the offensive line and started all 12 games of his sophomore season at right tackle. Despite missing several games due to a sprained knee, Smith earned an All-Big 12 honorable mention as he started seven games at left tackle as a junior.
Prior to his senior year, Smith graduated a year early from the school in May 2008, having graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Education degree in recreation. As a senior in 2008 he was an All-American selection and an All-Big 12 Conference selection as well. Smith was named Baylor's co-Most Valuable Player. He was credited by the school with 96 knockdown blocks, which were the most ever by a Baylor offensive lineman. Smith gave up 3½ sacks and was penalized five times. With Baylor running a spread offense since the arrival of new head coach Art Briles, Smith was usually in a two-point stance for pass protection, which caused NFL scouts to question his run blocking ability.
Professional career.
2009 NFL Draft.
At the 2009 NFL Combine, Smith recorded the 11th-fastest 40-yard dash (5.09 seconds), tied for the fourth-most repetitions in the bench press (33), and was sixth in the three-cone drill (7.53 seconds) among all offensive linemen who participated. He scored a 23 on the Wonderlic Test. Smith drew comparisons to Ryan Clady.
Smith was drafted second overall in the 2009 NFL Draft by the St. Louis Rams. He was Baylor's first first-round draft pick since Daryl Gardener in 1996.
St. Louis Rams.
On July 30, 2009 the Rams agreed to terms with Smith on a six-year contract with $33 million in guarantees. The maximum value of the deal is $61 million. The sixth year is voidable, which would leave Smith with $6.6 million per year over five years.
When a member of the Rams, Smith was the starting right tackle. Though drafted as a left tackle, Smith was beaten out by 2010 Rams rookie Rodger Saffold. As a rookie, in 2009, Smith played mostly right tackle, although he played some left tackle—the position for which he was drafted. In his rookie season Smith suffered a serious concussion November 22, 2009. "My situation was real serious," Smith related and it caused him to miss the remainder of his rookie season.
New York Jets.
The St. Louis Rams agreed to trade Smith to the New York Jets in exchange for tackle Wayne Hunter on August 27, 2012. He was released from the Jets on February 19, 2013.
New Orleans Saints.
On April 11, 2013, Smith signed with the New Orleans Saints. On August 21, 2013, he was released by the Saints.
Second stint with the Jets.
On August 23, 2013, Smith was re-signed by the New York Jets. He was released on August 31, 2013.

Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company

The Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company was one of the earliest firms in the United States established especially for the manufacture of steam locomotives. Located in Taunton, Massachusetts, the company was organized in 1849 and incorporated the following year by William A. Crocker, Willard W. Fairbanks, William R. Lee and their associates. Their first engine, the "Rough and Ready" was delivered in May 1849.
Company history.
Willard W. Fairbanks was a machinist who had worked in Providence, Rhode Island building stationary and marine engines. The company's first engine was built from castings and plans prepared by George S. Griggs, who had been associated with the Boston & Providence Railroad, one of the earliest railroads in New England, which began operation in 1849.
The company's shops were located on Wales Street just west of downtown Taunton along what was then the Taunton Branch Railroad, and later part of the Old Colony Railroad's vast system in Southeastern Massachusetts. 
In 1852 the company faced new competition from their neighbor across the tracks, the Mason Machine Works, a successful Taunton textile machine company, that decided to enter the locomotive-building trade. 
By 1860, Taunton Locomotive had produced almost 300 engines. In 1861, Harrison Tweed would take over control the company from Fairbanks, and lead it through perhaps its most productive period. He was succeeded by Parley I. Perrin (P.I. Perrin) in about 1871. Perrin began as a machinist had joined the company in 1846 as a forman and draftsman, and worked his way up through the leadership ranks.
By 1877, Taunton Locomotive had its 675th locomotive. However, by then the company lagged far behind the larger locomotive builders of the time, such as Baldwin and Schenectady. The engines of Taunton, and the other New England locomotive builders were considered obsolete compared to these larger establishments.
In 1883, the locomotive works established the Huber Printing Press Company to supplement its dwindling locomotive business. That same year, Nahum Stetson became president, after the death of Samuel L. Crocker.
The last locomotive produced by Taunton Locomotive was built in 1889. The company also ventured into steam-powered snow plows, and other items, but sales gradually declined during the last decade of the 19th century. The company lasted until 1899. Over 900 steam locomotives had been produced by the Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company in its roughly sixty years in existence.
Legacy.
In 1906 the site of the locomotive works was purchased by New England Cotton Yarns, a large conglomerate of textile mills, based in Boston. 
In 1947 the buildings of the Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company were demolished.
The site is now occupied by a shopping center, constructed in the 1970s as part of an urban redevelopment plan by the City of Taunton.

High school career.
While playing for South Panola High School in Batesville, Mississippi, Jerry was selected first team All-State and Class 5A Defensive Player of the Year by the Mississippi Association of Coaches. He was also named first team All-State by "The Clarion-Ledger".
Jerry signed with Ole Miss in the 2004 class, but decided to attend Hargrave Military Academy. There, he was rated as the No. 15 prep school player in the country by "Rivals.com". He played in eight games at Hargrave during the 2004 season and was credited with 30 tackles, including five quarterback sacks.
College career.
The 2005 season was Jerry's true freshman season at Ole Miss. After missing the first four games due to injury, he played in six of the final seven games. He finished the season with three total tackles.
In 2006, Jerry battled through injuries to play in eight games, making six starts along the defensive line. He made starts at end, tackle and nose tackle. He totaled 22 tackles on the season with 1 tackle for a loss and 1 QB sack. In the Spring, he received the Jeff Hamm Memorial Award for the most improved defensive player of spring drills. He moved from tackle to end and promptly emerged as the starter. Jerry was rated an "Emerging Star" at Ole Miss by Lindy’s magazine.
2007 saw Jerry named Second Team All-SEC by the Associated Press and Rivals.com. He started all 12 games at defensive tackle and was ranked sixth in the SEC in tackles for losses (TFLs) with 14. He finished second on the team in TFLs, 3 and a half QB sacks, 4 QB hurries and 58 total tackles.
In 2008, Jerry was named to the All-SEC First Team by the leagues coaches and to the All-SEC First Team by the nation's news media. Additionally he was named to the Associated Press All-America First Team.

Hayelom Araya

Major General Hadush "Hayelom" Araya (1955-1996) is a former member of the Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front (TPLF), which is the leading member of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) political coalition. While a member of the TPLF he acquired the nickname Hayelom, "Overpowering". 
He was born in Addi Nebreid in western Tigray, and although he completed high school in Adwa, he failed the national college entrance examination. After the Ethiopian revolution broke out, he joined the TPLF. As a commander of EPRDF forces, General Hayelom led his forces to northern Shewa and later marched to Addis Ababa coming out victorious in 1991. One of his most daring acts was the "Agazi action", which happened on the early evening of 5 February 1985: he led a squad of TPLF fighters in attacking the main prison in Mek'ele, and freed over a thousand prisoners, killed 16 prison guards and wounded 9 soldiers without losing a single man. He later become one of the military leaders in the defence force of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia.
General Hayelom was shot down in Addis Ababa at a restaurant bar 14 February 1996; the motives for his death remain unexplained. In May 2008, the Late General Hayelom Araya Monument was unveiled at his birthplace, Shire, in the Tigray Region.

Sherman Unger

Sherman E. Unger (October 9, 1927 – December 3, 1983) was a former official in the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, with his final role being the top lawyer for the United States Department of Commerce. Unger also was a federal judicial nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit at the time of his death.
Early life and education.
Born in Chicago, Unger earned a bachelor's degree in 1950 from Miami University in Ohio and a law degree in 1953 from the University of Cincinnati College of Law.
Professional career.
Unger began his career in the United States Air Force as a judge advocate, from 1953 until 1956. He then worked in private legal practice in Cincinnati as an associate and then as a partner for the firm of Frost & Jacobs from 1956 until 1969, when he became the general counsel of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Unger served in that role until 1970. Unger worked as a vice president of Cincinnati-based American Financial Corp. from 1971 until 1972. From 1972 until 1981, Unger practiced law in Cincinnati and Washington, D.C.
In 1981, Reagan appointed Unger to be general counsel for the United States Department of Commerce.
Failed nomination to the Federal Circuit.
On December 15, 1982, Reagan nominated Unger to a newly created seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. While the nomination died at the end of the 97th Congress, Reagan renominated Unger to the same Federal Circuit seat on April 21, 1983. Upon both times Unger was nominated to the Federal Circuit, the American Bar Association gave him a unanimous rating of "not qualified." The ABA's committee members who had investigated Unger, including former Secretary of Transportation William Thaddeus Coleman, Jr. and committee chair and future Commodity Futures Trading Commission chief Brooksley Born, had testified that he was not qualified "because he lacked the personal integrity and judicial temperament required of a federal judge." However, many supporters vouched for Unger's personal integrity, including Democrats from the Carter administration like former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler and former United States Attorney General Griffin Bell.
While the United States Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Unger's nomination on September 30, 1983, it took no action on Unger's nomination because he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Unger died on December 3, 1983.
Unger wound up being the only Reagan administration judicial nominee to earn a unanimous rating of "not qualified" from the ABA.
For more than 20 years after Unger's nomination, no other federal judicial nominee earned a unanimous "not qualified" rating from the ABA. Michael Wallace, a failed nominee of President George W. Bush to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, was the next nominee to earn such a rating.

Spinneret (polymers)

Spinneret refers to a multi-pored device through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers. Streams of viscous polymer usually exit into cool air or liquid to solidify. The individual polymer chains tend to align in the fiber because of viscous flow. This airstream liquid-to-fiber formation process is similar to the production process for cotton candy. The process may be referred to as Gel spinning or Polymer spinning. 
The alignment imposed during the extrusion process is important in determining the nature of the resultant fibre, both in synthetic polymer production and in the silk spinnerets of insects and spiders.

Alphonso Smith

Alphonso Smith, Jr. (born October 20, 1985) is an American football cornerback who last played for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). Smith played college football for Wake Forest University, and received All-American honors. He was selected by the Denver Broncos in the second round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He is currently a free agent.
Early years.
Smith was born in Pahokee, Florida. He played quarterback and defensive back at Pahokee High School, and was runner-up for the state Player of the Year award as a senior after leading the school to a 13-1 record and the Class 2B state championship. He earned first-team all-state honors as a senior cornerback, totaling 27 tackles, four interceptions and one sack. On offense, he threw for 2,400 yards and 32 touchdowns while also rushing for 640 yards and six scores as a senior. He also started on the school's basketball team.
College career.
Smith attended Wake Forest University, where he played for coach Jim Grobe's Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team from 2004 to 2008. Smith redshirted as a true freshman in 2004. As a redshirt freshman in 2005, Smith started all 11 games and finished the season with 60 tackles (52 unassisted), three interceptions, two sacks, 12 pass breakups and one forced fumble. He received first-team Freshman All-America honors from CollegeFootballNews.com, ESPN.com and Scout.com. In 2006, the sophomore played 14 games with three starts, registering 48 tackles (37 solo), three interceptions, four sacks, 11 pass breakups and one forced fumble.

Church of the Holy Cross (Middletown, Rhode Island)

The Church of the Holy Cross in Middletown, Rhode Island, is a parish church of the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island of The Episcopal Church. The church is located at 1439 West Main Road, Middletown, Rhode Island. It is an early example of Richard Upjohn's work in translating Gothic architecture from stone to affordable designs for small, wooden churches. Built in 1845, Holy Cross Church exemplifies the architecture made accessible by the publication in 1852 of Upjohn's book, Rural Architecture. In its survey of Middletown's architectural resources, the Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission recommended the Church of the Holy Cross for inclusion in the National Register, along with Upjohn's more luxurious Italianate Hamilton Hoppin House.
Description.
A 1-story, end-gable, Gothic Revival structure with patterned-shingle sides, a projecting pedimented entry, square belfry in front and stained-glass Gothic windows.
History.
Holy Cross Church was designed by Mr. Richard Upjohn, an Englishman, who also designed Trinity Church in New York and St. Stephen's and Grace Church in Providence, Rhode Island. Upjohn was commissioned to build three Episcopal churches on Aquidneck Island, the other two being St. Mary's in Portsmouth and the now demolished Old Emmanual Church in Newport.
At its consecration on October 14, 1845, Bishop Henshaw said, "Rustic in its exterior, but so chaste in its interior finish, and so perfect in its proportion, that it is more imposing in its religious impression and far better adapted to its sacred use than many buildings of far greater cost and pretensions."

History.
Early years.
The first four community colleges in Kansas were established in 1919, and GCCC is one of two from that group which still exist. It was created by county-wide election on April 1, 1919, and opened in September of the same year. GCCC initially shared facilities in Sabine Hall and Calkins Hall in the 100 block of Buffalo Jones Avenue with Garden City High School, and opened with a first class of less than three dozen students. The first graduate, Mildred Hope of Garden City, earned her degree in the spring of 1920.
1950s–1990s.
The college moved to the then-new Garden City High School building in 1954, and first occupied a campus of its own in 1958 on property where Buffalo Jones Elementary School is located. The first effort to establish GCCC as an entity separate from the Garden City public school system was launched in 1958. It was killed in a Kansas legislative committee, a second attempt was also rejected in 1962. In 1963, the college moved back to Sabine and Calkins Halls, and also made use of nearby Ben Grimsley Gym, as well as a group of adjacent World War II-era barracks buildings.
The Kansas Legislature passed the Community College Act in 1965, authorizing establishment of 22 independent colleges including GCCC. This authorized the institution to levy taxes, conduct its own programs, and function independently of the K-12 school system. County voters elected the first GCCC Board of Trustees in July 1965. Today, GCCC is one of 19 Kansas community colleges. The present 14-building, campus at 801 Campus Drive was designed between July, 1965 and January, 1966.
Voters approved a $2.5 million bond issue, supplemented by a $538,000 federal grant for construction. Erected between 1968 and 1970 were the original residence hall, Academic Building, Saffell Library, Administration Building, Fouse Science-Math Building, Pauline Joyce Fine Arts Building and Physical Education Building. The Collins Technical Building was added in 1974, and a residential life addition was built in 1978. The Penka Building was added in 1986, when additions were completed to the Joyce, Collins and PE Buildings. Williams Stadium, a baseball facility, was also added. In January 1996 a . 1.4 million dollar technical teaching laboratory was completed so that GCCC could provide more training for workers in area and national industries.
2000s–present.
A three-building student apartment complex opened in 2002, and a , two-level addition to the original student center was completed in 2003, with the entire structure renamed the Beth Tedrow Student Center. The , three-level, two-story Student and Community Services Center opened in August, 2006 and was dedicated in October of the same year. Attached to the original Administration Building, the $3.12 million facility consolidated public and student services, provided an on-campus home for adult basic education, added a series of 21st Century classrooms and created a single point of assistance for most services GCCC provides.
Accreditation.
Garden City Community College has regional accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In addition, the GCCC Nursing Program is accredited by the Kansas State Board of Nursing and the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC). Certain GCCC programs have also obtained other specific individual accreditation. GCCC has been accepted for the continuous quality improvement accreditation model by the national Academic Quality Improvement Project. While the normal accreditation review process is every ten years, member schools who participate in the AQIP program have their accreditation reviewed yearly.

Associate of General Studies is a transfer degree which can be applied toward the general education requirements for a baccalaureate degree at the Regents’ universities in Kansas. Although it is not designed to satisfy the requirements entirely, it is appropriate for students who are having difficulty selecting a specific program of study or who are primarily concerned with a broad survey of interests. In some limited cases, this is also the preferred degree for students transferring in Agriculture.

The Unknown Witches of Oz

The Unknown Witches of Oz: Locasta and the Three Adepts is a 2000 novel written by Dave Hardenbrook, with illustrations by Kerry Rouleau. As its title indicates, the book is an entry in the long-running series of books about the Land of Oz, written by L. Frank Baum and his successors.
The publication of "The Unknown Witches of Oz" was timed to coincide with the centennial of the original Oz book, "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" (as was also true of Gina Wickwar's "The Hidden Prince of Oz" and Edward Einhorns's "Paradox in Oz"). Hardenbrook's novel is the first volume of a planned trilogy.
The witches.
Locasta is the name that Baum provided his Good Witch of the North in his 1902 dramatization of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz". The Three Adepts are characters that Baum introduced in his final Oz book, "Glinda of Oz" — though Hardenbrook changes their names and particulars, making them Locasta's granddaughters.
The plot.
Locasta, the Good Witch of the North, is forced out of Oz by the evil witch Mombi. Locasta solicits help to return to Oz, from a boy named Dan, a sixteen-year-old orphan she meets at the Los Angeles Public Library. Back in Oz, she learns that the land is in danger of conquest by a constellation of evil forces, including the Nome King, a genie named Taarna, and the demons and witches of Whaqoland. Locasta joins with Glinda and Princess Ozma, and the Adepts, to foil the villains and restore the moral order.
In a notable departure from the practice of earlier writers on Oz, Hardenbrook creates a teenaged protagonist as a romantic interest for Ozma.
Conceptual frame.
Hardenbrook goes farther than many previous Oz authors in an attempt to provide a contemporary conceptual framework for the fictional world of Oz. In a Prologue titled "The Story So Far," Hardenbrook specifies that Oz exists in a parallel universe, in "a galaxy very like our own Milky Way" with "a star virtually identical to our sun..." The star has "a planet that corresponds to Earth" — though it differs in possessing "two extra moons and a polychromatic ring system..." The planet contains continents and archipelagoes that include "Dodgesonia" and "Geiselgea" as well as "Baumgea."
Hardenbrook goes on to summarize the narrative background of the Oz mythos — the fairy queen Lurline and the whole scope and structure of magic, wizards and sorceresses crucial to Baum's fantasy — before he gets to his story in earnest.
Tone.
Hardenbrook writes in a more modern and ironic vein than the traditional Oz authors did; he describes Ozma as "the only world leader with an unwavering one-hundred-percent job approval rating!" His malevolent genie comes out of a spray can. Allusions to Bill Clinton, Rush Limbaugh, and environmentalism also occur. As with other attempts at contemporizing Oz fiction (see, for example, Martin Gardner's "Visitors from Oz"), the success of the approach will vary with the taste of the individual reader.
The author is a computer adept, and spices his story with elements of technology and virtual reality — Virtual Sprites and a Virtual Forest.

Bob Nilsson

Robert "Bob" Nilsson was the oldest of the four Nilsson brothers and one of the greatest relievers in the history of Australian baseball leagues. Bob's brother Dave Nilsson was the first Australian All-Star in MLB, his brother Gary Nilsson played in the minors and Ron Nilsson also played in Australia for one year. Bob's son Jay Nilsson began his minor league career in 2006.
Bob Nilsson was the first Australian of the modern era to sign a professional contract with a MLB team, inking a deal with the Cincinnati Reds in 1978. He never made it to the US minor leagues, though.
Playing History.
When the Australian Baseball League was founded in 1989–1990, Bob was one of the early stars. He hit .315/.351/.575 for the Gold Coast Dolphins while going 3-4 with 2 saves and a 1.11 ERA. He was named to the ABL All-Star team as the top relief pitcher. 
In 1990–1991, Nilsson went 7-0 with 7 saves and a minuscule 0.27 ERA for the Daikyo Dolphins. He saved more than twice as many games as the runner-ups, who included Tim Worrell. He again would have easily led the ABL in ERA had he qualified. He also tied for third in victories. He was named to his second straight All-Star team. 
Nilsson fell to 2-3 with 10 saves and a 2.68 ERA in 1991-1992. He led the league with 23 appearances and was one save behind leader Mark Ettles. He was the second team All-Star reliever this time, trailing Ettles. He helped Daikyo to a title.
He had his worst year in 1992-1993, going 3-1 with 9 saves and a 5.08 ERA for the Brisbane Bandits and allowing a .327 average. He was second to Ross Jones in saves and led the league with 26 appearances. 
With the East Coast Cougars in 1993-1994, Bob's record was 0-3 with 7 saves and a 3.51 ERA. He was second to Jones in saves and was again a second-team All-Star pick.
In 1994-1995, Nilsson went 6-4 with 8 saves and a 3.98 ERA for East Coast. He was third in the league with 24 games pitched and second in saves, one behind Jones. He was the first-team All-Star relief pitcher for the third time in his six seasons.
Nilsson was 4-4 with 4 saves and a 4.98 ERA in the 1995-1996 Australian Baseball League. He made 18 appearances, tied for second in the league, and was 4th in saves. In 1996-1997, Bob was 4-3 with 2 saves and a 5.01 ERA. He tied for fourth in the ABL with 21 appearances. In the 1997 Intercontinental Cup, he had a 4.76 ERA in four appearances for the national team. Only Ettles showed up more frequently on the mound for Australia in that competition.
Nilsson's record in 1997-1998 read 5-3, 4 Sv, 4.78. He led the ABL with 27 games pitched. Bob retired after that season.
Overall, Nilsson was 34-25 with 53 saves and a 3.51 ERA in 194 games pitched in eight ABL seasons. Through 2006–2007, he ranks 8th in the history of Australian leagues in ERA (right behind Shayne Bennett), 15th in innings pitched (328, despite only 8 starts), first in games pitched (194, 33 ahead of Grahame Cassel), 6th in wins, tied for 9th in losses and first in saves (10 ahead of Jones).
Post career.
Bob's sons Jay and Ryan as well as nephew Daniel play for the Redcliffe Padres. Since his professional baseball career, Bob has become a Level 2 National Accredited Coach and has coached Australian junior baseball teams, the Queensland Rams as well as other Queensland junior baseball teams and is the current head coach for the Pine Hills Lightning

Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre

The Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre () is a privately funded public policy think tank in Hong Kong. The organisation declares its mission as "to promote the understanding of the 'one country, two systems' arrangements in Hong Kong and other socioeconomic policies in Hong Kong, for public benefit." 
The Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre emerged as a leading advocate of policy to the administration of Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang. Of eight undersecretaries and nine political assistants appointed in May 2008 as part of the Tsang administration's plan to "groom political talents," seven were identified by governance activist David Webb as having close ties with the Bauhinia Foundation. 
In the subsequent (first) CY Leung government of Hong Kong, the think tank was said to be "struggling to retain its relevance". However, its Undersecretary for Home Affairs, Florence Hui Hiu Fai, had a senior planning role at Standard Chartered, where Bauhinia Foundation chairman Norman Chan was formerly Vice Chairman for Asia, and she also served on the foundation's Health Care Study Group. And the Political Assistant to the Secretary for Home Affairs, Zandra Mok Yee Tuen, was a senior manager at the foundation. 
Funding.
The foundation's opaque funding - it does not reveal the identities of its supporting trust's donors - makes its eligibility for tax exempt status controversial.
Management.
Since 2012, the chairman of the foundation has been Donald Li Kwok-tung.

Little Man (Alan Jackson song)

"Little Man" is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Alan Jackson. It was released in May 1999 as the fourth and final single from his album "High Mileage". The song topped at number three on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles charts, and four on the Canadian "RPM" Country Tracks chart.
Lyrics.
The song is about small businesses that struggled to compete against big businesses, such as corporations, but did not make it, referring to them as "the little man". The narrator tells about his memories as he looks at the storefronts of abandoned businesses that went under. ""I go back now and the stores are empty/ Except an old Coke sign dated 1950/ Boarded up like they never existed.""
Music video.
The music video starts out as Alan Jackson talking about his inspiration for writing the song before going into the actual video of the song. Jackson tells of a trip he took through random small towns where he saw many closed small businesses. Many of the places he visited he had been to as a child, and he realized how much they'd changed. The video was shot in the small towns of Lascassas, Tennessee, Jasper, Florida and Pavo, Georgia. Most of the video shows Alan driving down the main street waving at the townspeople. It was directed by Steven Goldmann.
Chart positions.
"Little Man" debuted at number 68 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts dated for the week ending May 29, 1999.

Wild Horse River

The Wild Horse River, formerly known as Wild Horse Creek, is a tributary of the Kootenay River, joining it near the town of Fort Steele, British Columbia, Canada. The river's canyon was the setting for the Wild Horse Creek Gold Rush and associated "war" during the gold rush of the mid-1860s.
Gold Rush.
Wild Horse River was discovered in the fall of 1863 by American prospectors. The river was originally known as Stud Horse Creek. The Wild Horse River yielded close to $7,000,000 in gold during the gold rush. The river is considered to be one of the greatest gold creeks in the entire province of British Columbia. A miner named Mike Reynolds who mined the river in the 1860s recovered a 36 ounce gold nugget. This was the largest nugget recovered from the river. The river was mined with many methods including hydraulics, tunnels, and shafts. During the Gold Rush this river went through two eras of great activity. The first era was from 1863 to 1868 and the second was from 1885 to 1900. The river was worked by both European and Chinese miners.

Title created by King Luís I of Portugal by a decree of 22 December 1887, in favour of Julião Casimiro Ferreira Jordão. The title was attributed for three generations and it was held by:
Being the late Viscount Jaime's only surviving child, Maria do Carmo was confirmed in the title by the Portuguese Counsel of Nobility, in charge of recognizing the use of titles after the fall of the Monarchy in 1910.
Because the title was attributed for three generations only, after the death of the last Viscountess, in 1980, the title was extinguished, though the representation of the same falls on the eldest of the thirteen Viscountess’ surviving children, António de Sousa Vadre Castelino e Alvim, a lawyer in Lisbon.

Redcliffe Padres

The Redcliffe Leagues Padres Baseball Club, also known as Peninsula Padres Baseball Club is a baseball club located in Redcliffe, Queensland that participates in the Greater Brisbane League competition and Brisbane North Region competition. As of the November 2011, it was the largest club in Queensland and second largest in Australia behind the Waverley Baseball Club in Victoria.
As of the 2011-12 season, the club fields a team in every age group of the Greater Brisbane League from Under 8 to Under 20, as well as seven senior teams including an Over 35 Master's team.
On 9 December 2008 it was named by the Australian Baseball Federation as the Club of the Year.
History.
Redcliffe Baseball club was founded as a senior club in 1948 by an American ex-serviceman named Chuck Carroll and was later named the Redcliffe Whitesox. Younger kids played at Redcliffe Police Citizens Youth Club then went elsewhere if they wanted to go on. Redcliffe Baseball Club had no direct feeder clubs from junior PCYC. In 1991 the PCYC could not support baseball anymore and the seniors wanted feeder clubs to support them so they joined forces at the Silcock Street oval and named themselves the Peninsula Padres – based on the San Diego Padres.
In the first year there were 7 teams in total. They needed a home run fence which they did not have at Silcock Street and could not put up. Council therefore asked them to relocate to the Redcliffe Showgrounds in 1996. The club had to take the fences down at showtime and then adjust the grounds after the show to make it suitable for baseball again. However, a big plus was the great light facility on the grounds. With greater promotion and a new facility, the move paid off with a boom and a resurgence of interest in baseball. Within a year at the Showgrounds there were 16 teams.
In 2003-2004 the Council offered Talobilla Park as an option. Touch football had rejected Council’s suggestion so baseball and softball worked together to establish these sports in a permanent setting. The council, Queensland Government and the club used money to put in irrigation, back nets, turf and ancillary fixtures etc. to make the move possible. Also shipped
in, was the old Redcliffe golf-club pro shop which is used for a canteen and meeting house. The move caused yet another resurgence and the club has now grown to 22 teams with about 225 players not to mention countless volunteers, coaches and administrators involved with the club.
Padres is now the biggest club in Queensland, as well as second largest in Australia.
2000–2001: Modern Major A.
In 2000, Baseball Queensland decided to make the Major A competition a wooden bat league and the Redcliffe Major A team led by Scott Brockie struggled to adjust to the change and finished mid-table. However, both Major B and C grade were finalists. The club fielded eleven junior teams and three senior teams and won its first ever Brisbane North premiership in the U12 age group.
2001–2002: Triumphant Padres.
The 2001–2002 season was the most successful year since the club had been formed ten years ago, with President Terry King and A-Grade coaches Phil Schramm and Glen Brockie, two premierships were won in both Major B (second division) and Minor A (fourth division). The club fielded four senior and sixteen junior teams, making it the largest club in Queensland that year. Before the start of the season, the clubs storage shed, a chicken shed used for the local Redcliffe Show, was set on fire by an arsonist with the club losing all but a single junior kitbag. That season the club also improved facilities at Redcliffe Showgrounds were the club was based by adding netting to the batting cages and having a PA system installed. The club was awarded four Greater Brisbane League semi-finals and the Northside junior grand finals.
2002–2003: A Growing Club.
By the start of the season, the club had increased their numbers to six senior teams and twenty junior teams on the back of a heavy push in recruiting and opening of a Redcliffe schools competition. With a change of hands of club presidents to Keith Land, the club reigned as the largest club in Queensland and was named as the "Redcliffe Leagues Club Leading Edge Club of the Year". The year also came with news of moving to a new grounds at Talobilla Park by the 2004–2005 season. The club was awarded six Greater Brisbane League semi finals and three grand finals as well as the North preliminary finals. In addition the Queensland Academy of Sport utilised the fields for training as well as the Queensland Under 23 and regional teams. The season marked all Major league teams making the finals as well as the clubs first official Canadian import, Cav Whitely. The club also set a Greater Brisbane League record in Major C, defeating Toowoomba Rangers 42–0.
2003–2004: Last at Showgrounds.
Much of the focus of the season was off the field as the club prepared for a move to their new grounds at Talobilla Park by securing government and council grants. The club had a small decrease in size as it went down to six senior teams and seventeen junior teams, yet only managed to secure an U12 premiership. The Major C team also came close to breaking its own Greater Brisbane League record when they defeated Narangba Demons 41–1 to become minor premiers.
2007–2008: A-Grade Success.
The 2007-2008 proved to be the most successful one in history for the Redcliffe Padres Major A team as the won the Commissioners Cup and finished 3rd overall in the regular season standings of the Greater Brisbane League with teams stats of a win percentage of .656, batting average of .256, ERA of 4.46 and fielding average of .936. Success in the 2007-2008 season was mostly on the back of Canadian import Brett Murray who finished the season with an ERA of 2.42 and 122 strikeouts over the course of 104.1 innings and a 11–3 pitching record, highest in the league. Brett also contributed with the bat collecting 38 hits, including 11 doubles in the season. Steven Greer was a surprise representative for the Queensland Rams team that year along with Jay Nilsson and coach Bob Nilsson, Steven led the team with runs scored (30) and bases stolen (18 from 19 attempts), this capped off a fine Claxton Shield performance from previously unknown Steven Greer with 3/6 in two games including 3 RBIs. Phil Schramm also had a high season with an OB% of .480 in 19 games including 4 saves. Schramm also led the league in hit by pitch balls, an astounding 16 times.
The team had some success after qualifying for the post season, winning their semi-final series 2–0. However, the grand final series against Runcorn Indians proved to be difficult as import and starting pitcher Brett Murray's visa expired before the series could commence. A defensively weak Padres team lost the series convincingly 2–0 to be the Greater Brisbane League runners up.
2008–2009: Australian Club of the Year.
The A-Grade team looked promising with two new Canadian imports, Devon Franklin and Brandon Hunter as well as a couple of new senior players, including the return of ex Queensland Rams pitcher Brian Debert. On top of the collection of new senior players, the A-Grade team would also see the emergence of eligible U18 players such as Queensland U18 pitcher, Lucas Bakker.
The team got off to a shaky start making 18 errors and only one win in their first four games, but managed to notch wins against all three Brisbane Metro teams in as many weeks following. However, the clubs A-Grade success was dampened by announcement of Canadian Devon Franklin that he would be leaving Australia early to go home before Christmas.
At the Christmas break, Padres was awarded the opportunity to play in the second consecutive A-Grade Commissioners Cup, with coach Bob Nilsson and center fielder Stephen Greer away after being called up to the Queensland Rams squad. The team played Surfers Paradise on 21 December at Beenleigh Hawks baseball ground and retained the shield under coach and Nilsson brother, Ron Nilsson. The game was won 4–3 with Brian Debert pitching 8 innings.
The A-Grade team looked like they were going to cement a 2nd place finish on the Northside until a horror run in March. Apart from the a two game sweep against All-Stars, where A-Grade veteran Danny Dunsdon became the first player to play 400 games for the club, the team lost their four remaining games against Windsor and Pine Rivers meaning the team only scraped into the finals with the 2nd wildcard. They would face off against Pine Hills Lightning in the semi finals but lost to an opposition with far more momentum going into the finals in the 3rd game of a best of three series.
The B-Grade team also had a horror run in the second half of the season, dropping them from equal 3rd at the end of the year to 8th by the end of the season. This horror run was not assisted by a mid-season injury to pitcher William Preinke who broke his arm while pitching.
Major C, Minor A and Minor C enjoyed finals baseball as well, but neither grades managed to qualify for the final. Indeed the only premiership for the club would be the U16 Division 1 team, who also won the minor premiership that year.
On 9 December 2008, the club was named by the Australian Baseball Federation as the 2009 Baseball Club of the Year along with the Doncaster Baseball Club in Victoria, the largest club in Australia. In May, the club was also awarded Baseball Queensland junior club of the year as well as Sally West being awarded Volunteer of the Year.
2009-10 season: Major A Minor Premiers.
The Greater Brisbane League 2009-10 season commenced late September in 2009 and is an important one for the club as a new Greater Brisbane League format will be introduced with the Major A and Major B split into two divisions as well as a Masters competition being run by Baseball Queensland. The season saw the introduction of teams from Carina and Toowoomba back into the Majors.
On 2 July, the club announced its new A-Grade coach as Todd Fairbrother, an ex Daikyo Dolphins and Queensland Rams player and coach to replace retired Bob Nilsson. Bob, however, soon returned to coach the B-Grade team and helped manage the A's.
The club finished 5th overall after the qualifying rounds with a 9–5 record, placing them in the top eight and qualifying for the Queensland Major League. Although the team started strong in the qualifying round, the team dropped four straight games including one run losses to Wests and Beenleigh Hawks, but finished strong with the return of Rodney Wodson from overseas, winning six from their last seven.
After the preliminary rounds, the B-Grade team, by finishing 2nd, qualified for the Commissioners Shield and defeated Windsor 7–6 for the clubs third successive Commissioners Shield trophy. With expanded rosters for the 2010 Claxton Shield, four players were named in the active 19-man roster; Carlos Prichard, Steven Greer, Rodney Wodson and Jay Nilsson.
The clubs regular season was the best ever for a Redcliffe A-Grade team, finishing with a 14-4 record securing the minor premiership and top seed for the finals. The team included Jay Nilsson leading the league in batting average (.443) and Rodney Wodson leading the league in ERA (1.77). It was also the first season of Daniel Nilsson who represented Australia in the 2009 World Youth Baseball Championship before the season and managed to hit a home run in his debut at bat.
The finals run was less than ideal for A-Grade who went down to Windsor in three games (6-5, 5-6, 5-6) in the semi-final and Wests (9-0, 9-18, 2-8) in the preliminary final. Wests went on to beat Windsor for the premiership. The only successful team in the season being the SQBL A team who defeated Pine Hills 11-4.
2010-11 season.
With the departure of Bob Nilsson, Phil Overlack joined Todd Fairbrother at the helm of the A-Grade squad. The team qualified for Major League, but missed out on finals by 1 win. The 7-9 Pine Hills Lightning would go on to defeat the 16-2 Windsor Royals in A-Grade that year.
All other grades qualified for the finals, with Major B bowing out in the preliminary final, SQBL A losing their grand final by 1 run in the final inning, SQBL B winning the premiership and SQBL C scraping into the semi finals, but getting thoroughly defeated.
Uniform.
As of the 2009-2010 season, there are two uniforms used, one for U8's to Little League (U12) and one for U14's up. The junior uniform is a singular grey T-shirt with red 3/4 sleeves and drawstring, belt-less grey pants. The senior uniform is a red undershirt with red piping around the neck and down either side of the front buttons and "Padres" in red letters outlined in white arched across the chest. Players also get to choose a personal number between 1–99 that is displayed on the back of their overshirt in large red block numbers with white outline. Pants are like juniors except they are button-up grey pants with red piping and a red belt. Both the juniors and seniors wear red socks and the Padres cap is red with a stylized 'P' for Padres, very similar to the Philadelphia Phillies cap insignia.
While the Redcliffe Baseball Club was known as the 'Whitesox' from 1951 till 1973. The uniform was a black undershirt and overshirt with white trim sleeves. On the right middle side of the shirt was the word "SOX" in an Old English font, diagonally arranged. The cap was white with black brim and the SOX logo printed diagonally across it. Pants were plain white with a black belt and socks.
The first Peninsula Padres uniform was worn between 1992 and 1995 uniforms were a red 3/4 length sleeved undershirt and a white bodied, red pin striped T-shirt styled overshirt with "Padres" arched across the chest. Pants were white, also with red pinstripe, instead of the current grey and socks were white with red trimmed sides. The cap was primary red with the insignia a red oblate 'P' cutting into an upside white oblate 'P' to form a square. The juniors wore a plain white uniform with a red collar trim and "Padres" in red arched across the chest. Pants were plain white with a red pipe down the outer leg sides. Plain white socks were also worn. Insignia was on the right sleeve of both uniforms.
In the 1995–1996 season the red undershirt was reduced to a T-shirt size and only visible above the overshirts collar. The hat insignia was changed to the stylized 'P' and sock colour was reversed so that socks were now primarily red with white foot and side trim. Juniors were changed to a red instead of white base to the uniform and the word "Padres" was changed to white.
The modern uniform was first issued at the start of the 1999 season. The overshirt was changed to the grey base with red piping and sleeves shortened so the undershirt was visible and pants were changed to grey with red piping. Also the socks changed to a plain red. The cap changed slight as the 'P' was thinned, giving a more stylistic look. In the 2002–2003 season, the Major A team wore a black undershirt and socks, as well as a black with red brimmed cap instead of the traditional red for night games played on a Friday night. The night uniform was scrapped by 2004 and the singular uniform for all senior teams returned.
Current Season.
The current season has seen a major reshuffling in the A-Grade playing roster with long time Padres players Jay Nilsson, Ryan Nilsson and Steve Greer all opting to join Bob Nilsson at Pine Hills Lightning. The club also lost pitcher Rodney Wodson to Pine Hills, Brian Debert to All-Stars, Shannon Mills to Windsor Royals as well as Lucas Bakker and Jake Pannunzio to college. To fill the player drain, the club added imports Jeff Tezak and Kevin Hoef from the United States. Also returning from college was Nathan Corscadden and Greg Johnston as well as the debuts of Australian junior representatives Sam Holland and Mike Young.
The club qualified in 5th position after the first half of the season for Major League.
School Competition.
In 2002, members from the Redcliffe committee succeeded in creating a primary schools baseball competition on the Redcliffe Peninsula in Queensland to be created alongside other summer sports such as cricket and softball. This included teams from Humpybong, Scarborough, Kippa Ring, Hercules Road, Southern Cross and Grace Lutheran primary schools who play during their Friday afternoon sport at Talobilla Park. In 2009, this competition had a total of 16 teams and is the backbone to recruiting juniors in Redcliffe, making baseball more popular than cricket in Redcliffe.
Media coverage.
The "Redcliffe and Bayside Herald" as well as many other regional and Quest Community Newspapers and the now defunct "Peninsula Post", have been publishing articles and results about the Padres since its inception. Since the 2006–2007 season however, articles have become more in depth as the club has become recognised as one of Redcliffe's top sporting clubs. The club is also covered by online newspaper "Redcliffe City News". Major League results are also covered by the television network 7 and more in depth results are covered by "The Sunday Mail" and "The Courier Mail" as of the 2008–2009 season.
Records.
Notable individual records set in one game, these include all games between the 1992–1993 season to present from grades Under 16 Division 2 to Major A. Where tied, the higher grade is awarded the record.
Notable players.
The following players have either played for the Queensland Rams, Australia or professionally.

Janet C. Long

Janet C. Long (born November 6, 1944) is a Democratic politician and educator who serves as a member of the Florida House of Representatives for House District 51. She was a member of the Seminole, Florida City Council from 2002 to 2006. She was first elected to the Florida Legislature in 2006, and was re-elected in 2008.
Biography.
Long was born in West Stewartstown, New Hampshire. She graduated from Fryeburg Academy. She attended Nasson College, Eckerd College and St. Petersburg College. She is the director of advancement at Clearwater Central Catholic High School.
Long gained political experience as a legislative aide and as a deputy commissioner for the Florida Department of Insurance.
She is married to Richard L. Long with three children, Anissa, Paul, and Richard, and two grandchildren. Her son Paul was nominated to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroism in Afghanistan May 18, 2008.
Political career.
Seminole City Council.
Long announced her candidacy for one of three available seats on the Seminole City Council in November 2001. At the time, she owned a consulting firm and served on the tree advisory committee. She was also a member of the Greater Seminole Area Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, and served on the governor's tax reform task force.
The Greater Seminole Area Chamber of Commerce held a forum for the City Council candidates in February 2002. Each candidate had a brief time to make an opening statement, answer two questions, and make a closing statement. Long cited her three decades of experience, including her advocacy work with the Insurance Commission, her work on government committees, and her receptiveness to community input. She advocated care in annexation. She received the support of the Seminole Professional Fire Fighters Association. She was elected to the Seminole City Council in March 2002, her first publicly elected office. Of the three people elected to the council in that race, she had the most votes.
In 2003, she supported levying fines for false fire alarms. The fines would increase after with the fourth false alarm in a twelve-month period. The legislation addressed concerns that false alarm response was reducing the availability of fire fighters. About ten percent of the fire department's calls had been to false alarms, with most of those due to faulty alarm systems.
She also favored the changing the name of the city's signature festival, the "Seminole Pow Wow." The name was considered offensive, and politically incorrect, as well as inappropriate as being totally unrelated to Native American culture.
She ran unopposed for re-election to the City Council in 2004. In 2005, a resolution by the U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement urged cities to "take actions to reduce global warming pollution." The Seminole City Council declined to support the resolution by a vote of four opposed to three in support. Long voted to support the resolution, along with Mayor Dottie Reeder and Patricia Hartstein.
Florida Legislature.
2006 campaign.
In her first state legislative campaign, Long was elected to the Florida House in 2006, narrowly defeating her former colleague, former Seminole Mayor Dottie Reeder.
She replaced Leslie Waters, who had been term limited out, and who declined to run for the District 51 seat in 2008.
Long had run unopposed in the Democratic primary.
Long had resigned her position on the Council in March 2006, saying that it would be a conflict of interest to continue on the council while running for State office. She chided Mayor Reeder for remaining as mayor while campaigning.
At a Seminole Chamber of Commerce luncheon meeting in February 2006, Long identified education, insurance, and affordable housing as top priorities.
During the campaign, Long suggested solutions for the Florida insurance crisis, while acknowledging the complexity of the issues. She recommended making Citizen's Property Insurance Co, the state-run "insurer of last resort," more like a business, assessing risk and operating within a balanced budget. She recommended forming a consortium of coastal states to share costs in dealing with windstorms and catastrophic loss. She also recommended looking into "insurance savings accounts" to deal with catastrophic loses. These accounts would be funded with money from premiums paid by citizens and the private insurers. She received the endorsement of the "St. Petersburg Times",
as well as the Tampa Bay Builders Association and The Pinellas Realtor Organization.
2006–2008 term.
As a freshman representative, Long was appointed to the Insurance Committee, the Education Innovation & Career Preparation Committee, Military & Veterans' Affairs Committee, and the Schools & Learning Council. She was one of three Pinellas County representatives to support school vouchers (corporate-tax-credit scholarships), along with Bill Heller and Darryl Rouson.
Long used her office to champion unincorporated residents within her district, who felt they were not receiving adequate benefits from the Pinellas Park Water Management District. The district builds and maintains drainage projects in mid-Pinellas County. Residents in the Bayou Club and Lealman areas did not feel they received direct benefits from the water management district, and that they should be able to opt out of paying taxes to it. The District responded that Bayou Club would not exist without the drainage system it provided. Representative Long sought to have the matter decided by referendum.
Long sponsored a bill that would prohibit local governments from spending public money on "political advertisement or electioneering communication." 
She opposed a 2008 bill, HB 257, that required pregnant women to have a sonogram before undergoing a first-trimester abortion. She and state Senator Dennis L. Jones supported legislative action to require airports, universities and state agencies to recycle. Opponents of the bill said it would cost too much.
In August 2008, Long told the Pinellas Park Kiwanis Club that she supports taxing Internet sales as a possible solution to state budget problems. She said that Florida had grown markedly since the tax codes were first written, and that they needed updating.
2008 campaign.
Prior to the 2008 election, Long spoke of the need to create a wind insurance program and improve property insurance. She also expressed concern over the tax burden of low-income seniors, first-time home buyers, and small business owners. She advocated improvements in health care, such as electronic record keeping and affordable drugs for seniors. She received the endorsement of the Sierra Club and the "St. Petersburg Times". The Republican Party was impressed enough with her that it invited her to change parties. The "Times" lauded what it called her "clear-headedness" for her stances on reviewing special taxing districts (such as the Pinellas Park Water Management District), looking into consolidating state law enforcement agencies, and modifying the requirements for Bright Futures scholarships.
2008–2012 term.
In 2008, Long defeated Republican Christopher Peters, a lifeguard at Fort De Soto Park, with 58 percent of the vote. He was a substitute candidate, recruited to run after Republican Terry Sanchez withdrew her candidacy in September. After the election, Long said she looked forward to working on tax reform and health care legislation.

Fisherville, British Columbia

Fisherville is a classic example of a boom and bust gold rush town that characterized the 1860s in British Columbia. Gold was discovered here in 1864. As the first permanent white settlement in the East Kootenay region of the Southern Interior, Fisherville boasted a population of 5,000 inhabitants in 1865 and numerous buildings including six general stores, four saloons, two butcher shops, a brewery, a blacksmith’s shop, a boarding house, a post office, a sawmill, and government offices.
Fisherville was the first in the series of town sites which sat on the bench above the Wild Horse River. Successive settlements were referred to as ‘Wild Horse’ or ‘Kootenay’. The gold rush of 1864 was directly responsible for the creation of Galbraith’s Ferry which later became known as Fort Steele. When the railway bypassed Fort Steele in favour of Cranbrook in 1898, Fort Steele began to decline while Cranbrook grew to become the region’s economic and commercial centre. Cranbrook – formerly known as ‘Joseph’s Prairie’ – was also site of the Ktunaxa Chief Isadore’s favourite farm. However, land ownership was eventually granted to British Colonel James Baker.
Fisherville is the site of a former Gold Rush boomtown in the East Kootenay Named for Jack Fisher, who discovered the strike in the canyon of the Wild Horse River in 1863. Initially a thousand miners pushed into the canyon of that river and built Fisherville, which was soon moved a bit south and higher up than the original townsite had been when it was discovered rich gold deposits lay beneath the site. The new townsite was officially named Kootenai or Kootenay, and also Wild Horse, but remained commonly known as Fisherville. In its second winter (1864) saw only 100 white men and c.20 Chinese in residence; by 1866 the town's population was 300 Chinese and less than 100 whites.
In 1879 the HBC sold interests to Galbraith's firm, who operated a store at Fisherville. Fisherville was forgotten by the 1890s; all that remained by 1929 were a few remnants of log houses and a neglected cemetery, but... names on wooden boards at heads of graves have been long obliterated. One of those who died and was buried there was Mr. Boles Gaggin, the 2nd Gold Commission to serve on the creek..." (from History of the Cranbrook District by S.L. Thrupp, 1929; copy in Provincial Archives, accession 6 K84 T41.)

Gold Market

The Gold Market ( "Souk ad-Dahab"; also known as the Qissariya Market, "Souk al-Qissariya") is a narrow covered passageway located in the old quarter of Gaza; it is both a center for trading and buying gold, and location for foreign exchange. The Market lies along the southern edge of the Great Mosque of Gaza, beside the main Omar Mukhtar Street. The Market is configured with a pointed and vaulted roof above the central road, which is lined on both sides by small shops that are themselves roofed by the cross vaults of the covered central road.
History.
Gazan judge Sheikh Shams ad-Din al-Himsi ordered the construction of the Gold Market in 1476 CE, under Mamluk rule in Palestine. The Market originally formed a part of a much larger covered market, but most of the area was destroyed by the British Army during World War I. 
Throughout most of the 20th and 21st centuries, the market was visited mostly by men and women engaged to be married, to pick out gold jewellery, and by mothers-in-law to purchase gifts for their daughters-in-law. However, because of food shortages arising in Gaza from the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, the Gold Market presently is used chiefly by elderly Gazans selling family heirlooms to raise cash.

(Who Says) You Can't Have It All

"(Who Says) You Can't Have It All" is the title of a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Alan Jackson. It was released in January 1994 as the fifth and final single from his album "A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love)". The song peaked at number 4 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles chart and number 11 on the Canadian "RPM" Country Tracks chart. Jackson wrote the song with Jim McBride.
Content.
The song is about a man who lost his woman. The narrator tells of the lonely scene of his bedroom alone. ""A stark naked light bulb hangs over my head, There's one lonely pillow on my double bed."" According to Jackson, it's one of his favorite songs he's written.
Critical reception.
Deborah Evans Price, of "Billboard" magazine reviewed the song favorably, calling it a "heartbreak, pure country waltz" and saying that nobody does this type of song better than Jackson. Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A grade, calling it a "pure country song" due to the fiddle. He goes on to say that Jackson’s "equally forlorn voice singing the opening lyrics, 'A stark naked light bulb hangs over my head, there’s one lonely pillow on my double bed', serves as confirmation that we’re in for 3 minutes and 30 seconds of a deliciously straight-up country weeper that turns out to be one of Jackson’s most satisfying singles yet.

Anxiety (Smile Empty Soul album)

Anxiety is the second album by the alternative rock/post-grunge music group Smile Empty Soul. The album was scheduled to be released in the fall of 2005 via Lava Records, but after numerous push-backs due to heavy protest from religious groups (mainly in regards to the proposed lead single "Holes") the label scrapped the album and Smile Empty Soul departed. Though Lava chose not to release the album, they would not allow the band to on their own, as they owned the rights to the music. In 2008, the band was to finally able to officially release "Anxiety" through their own label, MRAfia Records. On March 9, 2010, "Anxiety" was re-released under F.O.F Label Group titled "More Anxiety". In addition to "Anxiety" tracks and the MRAfia Version bonus tracks, it also included a re-designed album cover art, a bonus DVD and "Hidden Track" (This is War Remix). There is also another variation of "More Anxiety" that contained another bonus track "Aneurysm" in addition to the previous "More Anxiety" released by F.O.F. Label Group. This variant was available for "free download" for those who donated to "Smile Empty Soul Feeds the Hunger" sponsored by "Groupees". 
The song "Don't Need You" peaked at #37 on the "Billboard" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

Eucalyptus × tetragona

Eucalyptus × tetragona is a hybrid species in the genus "Eucalyptus". The valid taxonomic name "Eucalyptus tetragona" was previously used to describe the species now known as "Eucalyptus pleurocarpa", but the type specimen upon which the name was based turned out to be a hybrid with "E. extrica", so the later homonym "E. pleurocarpa" was adopted for the pure species, and "E." × "tetragona" for the hybrid.

Customer feedback management services

Customer feedback management (CFM) online services are web applications that allow businesses to manage user suggestions and complaints in a structured fashion. A 2011 study conducted by Aberdeen Group showed that companies using customer feedback management services and social media monitoring have a 15% better customer retention rate.
Methodology.
Various online CFM services use different approaches. The aim of most methodologies is to measure customer satisfaction, with some models also measuring related constructs including customer loyalty and customer word-of-mouth (see Webreep Model). The methodology behind each service has an important impact on the nature of the service itself, and is the main differentiator between them. The main feedback management methodologies are listed below.
Feedback analytics.
Feedback analytics services use customer generated feedback data to measure customer experience and improve customer satisfaction. Feedback data is collected, then, using key performance indicators and feedback metrics, turned into actionable information for website improvement. Feedback analytics services provide website owners with the ability to create feedback forms that can be customized to fit the website and placed on all pages. This allows the website's users to submit feedback when they encounter a problem or have a feature request. A feedback button is visible at all times on each of the site's pages. Feedback analytics provide page- and website- level actionable data, and enable a website owner to read and manage feedback, as well as to get back to the users. The feedback is only made accessible to the website owner. This means that websites using feedback analytics are not exposed to the potential harm to their brand that feedback made public may cause. Feedback collection can be passive (using a feedback button), or active (using a feedback form set to appear in certain conditions), or both. The ability to choose the location of the button, as well as the frequency and conditions of the pop-up make feedback analytics a relatively non-intrusive approach from the point of view of the website user. Due to its measurable nature, feedback analytics data can be integrated with web analytics data, allowing website owners to understand what their users are doing on their site (using web analytics) and why they do it (using feedback analytics), in one single interface.
Surveys and polls.
Surveys and polls provide website administrators with a high-level understanding of user behavior on their site. By asking users a set of pre-defined questions using a pop-up questionnaire (sometimes criticized by website users for being an annoyance), surveys can provide a statistical review of their answers. Surveys and polls are also characterized by their focus on the “site-level”, providing answers about the users' experience on the site as a whole and the website's general performance. With answer to questions such as “Where did you hear about our site”, “What are you looking for” or “How old are you”, website owners are able to get a high-level understanding of their site’s users, though not to find and fix specific issues at the page-level. Since survey data is statistical, it is a methodology that works best for large websites with significant traffic, meaning that not all lines of businesses can benefit equally from it.
Idea management.
Idea management systems allow website users to suggest ideas, report problems, and vote for other users' ideas. Resembling a live forum, and displaying open discussions between users, idea management systems can reduce support efforts, allowing users to share their common knowledge, and to know if a problem or a solution has been reported previously. The idea management approach may also be useful for businesses looking to have their users publicly vote for their next development steps. A downside of public user management systems is the potential brand damage, when, for instance, users' complaints are displayed on a regular basis.
Customer Feedback Optimization.
Also referred to as Review Forum Optimization or RFO. Similar to SEO, CFO is the process of affecting the visibility of select web pages or results in the natural or un-paid results of various customer feedback management services or online review forums. CFO stands for Customer Feedback Optimization, thus the sites being optimized are those for the review, ranking, and giving feedback of goods and or services by customers. In recent years review forums or customer feedback management services have been growing rapidly in influence, with 83% of consumers saying online reviews influence their perception of a company. 
Some commonly known review forums are Yelp (20 million visits in February 2013), Trip Advisor (10 million visits in February 2013), Travelocity (3.7 million visits in February 2013), and Angie's List (3.4 million visits in February 2013). Top companies providing service in CFO are Moz, Medallia, Frost Media Solutions, and Bazaar Voice.

The leading idea aggregator based on feature set and number of unique visitors in 2009 was Get Satisfaction.

The 1st World Deaf Ice Hockey and Curling Championships was a winter sporting event at which deaf hockey and curling athletes competed at an elite level.
About 250 athletes from Canada, Great Britain, Russia, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia and the United States participated in the event. More than 800 fans and participants were involved as well.
To qualify for the games, athletes must have a hearing loss of at least 55 dB in their "better ear". Hearing aids, cochlear implants and the like are not allowed to be used in competition, to place all athletes on the same level. Other examples of ways the games vary from hearing competitions are the manner in which they are officiated. The hockey arenas are set up with strobe lights instead of blowing a whistle. 
Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada hosted this world sporting event for Deaf athletes from around the globe which was held from April 10 to 18, 2009.

Carl Filtsch

Carl Filtsch (28 May 1830 – 11 May 1845) was a Transylvanian pianist and composer. He was a child prodigy, and student of Frédéric Chopin.
Life and education.
Filtsch was born in Mühlbach (Sebeş) in present-day Romania. His father, a Lutheran church pastor in Mühlbach, was his first piano teacher. Carl and his brother Joseph, also a child pianist, arrived in Paris on November 29, 1841 and immediately sought out Chopin to be Carl's teacher. Though Chopin almost never taught children, and rarely gave a student more than one lesson per week, he agreed to teach Carl, and gave him three lessons per week.
Considered Chopin's most talented pupil, Filtsch received high praise from Franz Liszt, Friedrich Wieck, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Ignaz Moscheles, the music critic Ludwig Rellstab, and fellow child prodigy, Anton Rubinstein. Filtsch began touring Europe on concert tours at the age of 13. After triumphant concerts in Paris, London, and Vienna, his promising career was cut short by an early death in Venice from tuberculosis.
Quality of playing.
According to numerous letters from Chopin and his acquaintances, Chopin considered Filtsch the most worthy interpreter of his music. A friend of Chopin's, Ferdinand Denis, reported in an article in Vienna's "Der Humorist" in February 1843 that on one occasion after listening to Filtsch, Chopin exclaimed, "My God! What a child! Nobody has ever understood me as this child has...It is not imitation, it is the same sentiment, an instinct that makes him play without thinking as if it could not have been any other way. He plays almost all my compositions without having heard me them, without being shown the smallest thing - not exactly like me he has his own cachet, but certainly not less well."

White suckerfish

The white suckerfish or mantasucker, "Remora albescens", is a species of remora in the family Echeneidae, a group of elongated marine fish with adhesive discs for attaching to larger organisms. The distribution of this species is worldwide in warm open seas: it is found in the western Indian Ocean including Réunion and Mauritius, in the eastern Pacific Ocean from San Francisco to Chile (but is rare north of Baja California), and in the western and eastern central Atlantic Ocean from Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil and St. Paul's Rocks.
The white suckerfish can reach in standard length. The adhesive disk is short and wide, the length 34-40% and the width 22-26% of the standard length, with 13-14 lamellae. The pelvic fins are placed far forward and narrowly attached to the abdomen; the dorsal, anal, and pectoral fins are short with reduced rays. The dorsal fin rays number 18-23, the anal fin rays 18-24, and the pectoral fin rays 18-21. The dentition is specialized, consisting of many large, stout canine teeth set in large patches in broad jaws. The head, body, and fins are colored light brown, light tan, or light grey to whitish. Three documented specimens from the Gulf of Mexico show considerable variation in color pattern, from uniform grey or pale bluish-white to light grey, darkening on the sides and belly and bearing numerous elongated spots. One living specimen immediately darkened in color when it was removed from sea water and lightened when it was returned.
White suckerfish are rarely found free-swimming; they are host-specific to manta rays, and enter their host's mouth and gill chamber more often than any other remora. They are also occasionally found attached to sharks, and in the Indo-Pacific region to black marlin. Unlike some other remora species, parasitic copepods comprise a negligible part of the diet of the white suckerfish, suggesting it may not have a mutualistic relationship with its host. The white suckerfish responds to a touch on its belly by forcefully erecting its pelvic fins, possibly an adaptation to avoid crushing by its host. Nothing is known about their reproduction. It is used in Chinese medicine.

Blue Delight

Blue Delight is a jazz album by free jazz pioneer Sun Ra. 
The album was the first in a short-term recording deal with major label A&M Records on their "Modern Masters Jazz Series" imprint. 
The album was recorded at Variety Recording Studios, New York on December 5, 1988 featuring a 19-piece group that included several Arkestra members or veterans.
Eight tracks were used for the "Blue Delight" album. Other recordings from this session were released three years later by Rounder Records on the album "Somewhere Else", released shortly before Sun Ra's death. Currently the "Blue Delight" album is out of print and the copyright on the original album is still believed to be held by A&M's current owner, Universal Music.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Sean Westergaard awarded the album 4½ stars stating "Blue Delight is a great late-period Arkestra recording, notable for several reasons: 1. This is a very large, impeccably recorded Arkestra featuring special guests Tommy Turrentine and Don Cherry AND a number of Arkestra alumni returning for the date. 2. Although synthesizers are present, the majority of Ra's solos are on piano. 3. John Gilmore solos on nearly every cut. 4. The band swings mightily from start to finish. "Blue Delight" also features a program of a handful of standards mixed with Ra originals that don't head too far into outer space. Although this recording is out of print, it is well-worth seeking out.".

<doc id="20205059" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20205059" title="Tropical Storm Dorothy (1970)">
Tropical Storm Dorothy (1970)

Tropical Storm Dorothy was the deadliest tropical cyclone of the 1970 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth named storm and fifth tropical storm or hurricane of the season, Dorothy developed on August 17 from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It tracked west-northwestward throughout its entire duration, and despite forecasts of attaining hurricane status, Dorothy reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/) – slightly below hurricane status. The storm struck Martinique on August 20, and subsequently began a gradual weakening trend in the Caribbean Sea. On August 23, Dorothy dissipated south of Hispaniola.
Most significantly affected by the storm was Martinique, which received 26.8 in (680 mm) of rainfall in a 24 hour period. The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, resulting in about $34 million in damage (1970 USD); 186 homes were destroyed, and 700 people were left homeless. The flooding killed up to 50 people on the island. Elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, the storm killed one person on Dominica from heavy rainfall, and in Guadeloupe heavy damage to the banana crop was reported.
Meteorological history.
The origins of Tropical Storm Dorothy were from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 13. It tracked generally westward, developing into a tropical depression on August 17 about 1375 mi (2210 km) east of Tobago in the Lesser Antilles. Two days later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dorothy, while located about 500 mi (800 km) east of the Lesser Antilles, with its intensity confirmed by the Hurricane Hunters.
With light vertical wind shear and warm water temperatures, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked on August 19 that "hurricane status would probably be attained this afternoon or tonight." Its track was expected to continue generally west-northwestward, influenced by a ridge near the Bahamas, and within 60 hours Dorothy was forecast to be north or over Puerto Rico. However, a subsequent Hurricane Hunters flight reported a more westerly motion, which would bring its track through the central Lesser Antilles. Tropical Storm Dorothy gradually intensified, reaching peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) on August 20 just east-northeast of Barbados. Hurricane Hunters confirmed the intensity, though the flight also reported a weakness of low-level inflow. Despite maintaining winds of just below hurricane-force, there was no evidence of an eyewall on radars as the storm approached the Lesser Antilles. Late on August 20, the storm moved across Martinique into the Caribbean Sea, during which its low-level circulation became disorganized.
As Tropical Storm Dorothy moved further into the Caribbean Sea, it began a gradual weakening trend initiated by a persistent tropical upper tropospheric trough, as well as the presence of strong wind shear and a lack of inflow. Hurricane Hunter flights late on August 21 and early on August 22 failed to locate a closed low-level circulation, and as a result the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression. After another flight into the system could not detect a circulation, the NHC discontinued advisories on Dorothy to the south of Hispaniola late on August 22. Around the same time, thunderstorms increased in association with the cyclone, and forecasters remarked the potential for re-intensification over the western Caribbean Sea. However, the storm became more disorganized, and on August 23 Dorothy degenerated into a tropical wave.
Preparations and impact.
After the first tropical cyclone advisory was issued on Tropical Storm Dorothy, a hurricane watch and storm warning were issued for the Leeward Islands from Dominica northward. As its westward track became more apparent, the watches and warnings were extended southward to include Martinique and Saint Lucia. On Martinique, authorities released a statement that warned the public for the potential for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough waves. Also on the island, officials converted schools and government buildings into shelters for people in low-lying areas. As a result of the storm, the Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport in Le Lamentin was closed.
The storm dropped heavy rainfall while crossing the Lesser Antilles. In Martinique, the highest 24 hour total was 26.8 inches (680 mm) in Fourniols, which was twice the average rainfall for August. Additionally, the capital city of Fort-de-France reported 13.4 in (341 mm). There, the rainfall broke all records for durations up to 24 hours; about 1 inch (26 mm) fell in 5 minutes, and in one hour a station reported 6.02 inches (153 mm). The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, as well as rivers exceeding their banks; several bridges collapsed during the storm, and many homes were washed away. During the passage of the storm, sustained winds on the island reached 67 mph (108 km/h), with gusts reaching 99 mph (160 km/h) in Caravelle. Throughout the country, the storm destroyed 186 homes and left 700 people homeless. The passage of Dorothy left heavy crop damage on the island, totaling 32 million francs (1970 FRF, $5.8 million 1970 USD); a total of 3.75 mi² (9.72 km²) of banana crop was destroyed, and 2.16 mi² (5.6 km²) of sugar cane was destroyed. Damage on the island totaled 190 million francs (1970 FRF, $34 million 1970 USD).
Tropical Storm Dorothy caused several deaths on Martinique, although the exact death toll is unknown. The National Hurricane Center reported 50 deaths, although the post event report provided by the French meteorological agency reported 44 people dead or missing. Most of the deaths were in Saint-Joseph, where 20 people drowned in the Riviere l'Or. Floodwater rescues had been made difficult due to washed out roads and poor communications after the storm. In addition to the deaths, several people were injured. After the passage of the storm, Martinique was temporarily left isolated, when communications were downed with other nearby islands. The French Red Cross distributed 500 blankets and one ton of condensed milk; the agency also sought international assistance.
Elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, the storm caused flooding and mudslides in Dominica. There, the storm caused one death, when flooding heavy rainfall washed out a bridge. Also, all of the capital city of Roseau lost power and water service due to the storm. In neighboring Guadeloupe, the storm left much of the banana crop destroyed. Later, after it entered the Caribbean Sea, small craft warnings were issued for the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. In its review of the storm, the National Hurricane Center did not mention any damage in the Greater Antilles.

He is the current chairman of UN Panel of External Auditors.He holds a Masters Degree in Economics from the University of Delhi, and Masters in Public Administration from Harvard University. He is widely considered as symbol of the anti-corruption movement and is credited with having turned the office of CAG into a powerful force for accountability and transparency in contemporary India.
Early life and education.
He was born in Uttar Pradesh. He did his schooling from Vidya Niketan - Birla Public School, BPS Pilani Rajasthan and graduated from Hindu College, University of Delhi. He has a Masters Degree in Economics from Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi and Masters Degree in Public Administration from Harvard University, USA in 1988. He chose to study Financial Administration at Harvard Kennedy school in 1987 while he held the position of District Collector and Magistrate in the state of Kerala, India. He is married and has 3 children.
Career.
Rai is a 1972 batch Kerala cadre officer of Indian Administrative Service (IAS). He started his career as the sub-collector of Thrissur District. Later, he became the Collector and spent his eight years of career in Thrissur City. He was called the second Sakthan Thampuran for his role in the development of the Thrissur City. He was the MD of Kerala State Co-operative Marketing Federation from 1977 to 1980. Later he was appointed as Principal Secretary (Finance) in the State Government of Kerala. He had served senior positions in the Ministries of Commerce and Defence, Government of India. Prior to his appointment as CAG, he served as Secretary, Financial Services and Additional Secretary in the Banking Division including banks and insurance companies under Ministry of Finance.
Rai was instrumental in setting up the India Infrastructure Finance Company and was also on the Board of this company. Apart from serving in both, state and union governments, he has been a Director on several Boards including the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank, Life Insurance Corporation of India and Infrastructure Development and Finance Company of India.
United Nations Panel of External Auditors.
He is currently chairman of United Nations Panel of External Auditors and member of the Governing Board of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon has appreciated the panel and the yeoman service rendered by the external auditors in improving governance in the United Nations system. The panel headed by Vinod Rai discussed the major business transformations currently under way in the United Nations with Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon. The Panel of External Auditors plays an important role in promoting accountability and strengthening governance mechanisms in the UN organisations. Mr. Rai has taken over as the chairman of Governing Board of the Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (ASOSAI) on 29 February 2012.
CAG of India.
Forbes described Rai as being among that rare breed of civil servants who know how to get work done in the government. A former colleague says Rai has an uncanny ability to cut through red tape.
He was appointed as Comptroller and Auditor General of India with the backing of finance minister P. Chidambaram.
But he has served up uncomfortable audit reports that have pinned many government departments beyond the baseline.
He has consistently hit the headlines for his unforgiving audits, ranging from the scathing report on the shoddy preparation for the Commonwealth Games to the latest on spectrum allocations for second generation (2G) telecom services.
Along with a vibrant media, an activist Supreme Court and an increasingly vociferous civil society, his supporters say, Rai has made his office into a powerful force for accountability and transparency in modern India.
However , post his retirement and on closer scrutiny it appears that he ended up exceeding his constitutional mandate as CAG of India. The Joint Parliamentary Committee set up by the Indian parliament to look into the allocation of spectrum and the notional loss imputed by the CAG has held "On the question of auditing Government policy, the C&AG clarified during evidence:
“We are very clear. We do not question the Government (policy).” However, while communicating the decision regarding conduct of audit of grant of licences and spectrum, the then DG Audit,P&T in his letter dated 18 November, 2009 to the Department of Telecommunications had stated:“The aspects of policy, decisions taken, selection and rejection criteria of applicants for licences,process of issue of licences to the selected operators, policy and procedure adopted for allocationof 2G spectrum, logic and reasons behind the policies in these matters will also be included in the examination”. The matter was referred by the Department of Telecommunications to the
Ministry of Law and Justice. The view of the Ministry of Law and Justice was: “CAG Act, 1971nowhere provides that he has any duty or power to question the wisdom of the policy/law makers as policy decision may involve trial and error theory. CAG, CVC and other watchdog
no doubt play a very significant role in any democracy but they being constitutional/statutory functionaries cannot exceed the role assigned to them under the Constitution/law. Even the Courts refrain to question wisdom of Government in policy matters unless the policy decision is patently arbitrary, discriminatory or mala fide”. The opinion of the Ministry of Law and Justice was communicated to the C&AG Office by the Secretary, Department of Telecommunications on 7 September, 2010. It is surprising that despite the clarification by the Ministry of Law and Justice, the audit of the policy and calculation of loss thereon was carried out unhindered. In this context, the Opinion of the Supreme Court of India dated 27 September, 2012 in response to the reference made by the President of India conclusively hit the nail on the head: “Alienation of natural resources is a policy decision, and the means adopted for the same are thus, Executive
prerogatives.” In a democratic framework every organ of the Government is expected to exercise maximum caution and restraint not to trespass the boundaries already drawn up. The Committee would, therefore, like to uphold the prerogative of the Government in a Welfare State to formulate policies which should under no circumstance be subjected to audit or calculation of loss." 
His controversial tenure can at best be described as an attempt "to push the envelope too far. "
</ref Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee set up by the Indian Parliament " To examine matters relating to allocation and pricing of Telecom Licenses and Spectrum" dated 25th October 2013>
Reforms suggested by Vinod Rai.
All private-public partnerships (PPPs), Panchayti Raj Institutions and societies getting government funds should come within the ambit of the CAG. The PPP model has become a favourite mode of executing big infrastructure projects worth millions of rupees and these projects are not audited by the CAG.Now, 60 percent of government spending does not come under the scrutiny of the CAG. That is a huge amount and not accounted. When most of the indian politicians were opposing his activities, even at that time he did his duty very perfectly and aggressively.
Major Audits.
2G Spectrum allocation.
He is widely credited for the report on issue of Licences and Allocation of 2G Spectrum by United Progeressive Alliance, UPA government which resulted in a huge controversy in India. The report estimated that there was a "presumptive loss" of . In a chargesheet filed on 2 April 2011 by the investigating agency Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the agency pegged the loss at 
On 2 February 2012 the Supreme Court of India on a public interest litigation (PIL) declared allotment of spectrum as ""unconstitutional and arbitrary"" and quashed all the 122 licenses issued in 2008 during tenure of A. Raja (then minister for communications & IT in UPA government) the main accused. The court further said that A. Raja "wanted to favour some companies at the cost of the public exchequer" and "virtually gifted away important national asset".
However, the Presumptive Revenue loss calculation has never been established and has at best remained a conjecture .On 3 August 2012 when according to the directions of the Supreme Court, Govt of India revised the spectrum price to Rs 140 billion as reserve price for 2G spectrum and decided to sell airwaves in Delhi, Mumbai, Karnataka and Rajasthan for 1800 MHz band, and pan India for the 800 MHz band the response was poor to say the least . The Government then announced that it would auction the unsold spectrum in the 1800 MHz band from the 2012 spectrum auction, immediately after the first round, which began on 11 March, got over to comply with a Supreme Court order. The government also reduced the reserve price for 1800 MHz by 30% and for 800 MHz by 50% from the 2012 spectrum auction.Response to the 2013 spectrum auction was also very poor. While there were no bidders for spectrum in 1800 MHz and 900 MHz bands, MTS India was the only bidder for airwaves in 800 MHz band. Airtel and Idea were reluctant to participate in the spectrum auction for due to steep pricing of the auction.
The main criticism to the report now emerging is that the CAG exceeded its constitutional mandate as it attempted in a sense to change the policy of the Government of India which at that point was to promote telecom growth and not revenue maximisation by arguing that spectrum could only be sold by auction and creating figures for Presumtive losses around it .However,the Honble Supreme Court Of India in the Presidential Reference (2012) has upheld the right of the Government to frame policy and said "The norm of “common good” has to be understood and appreciated in a holistic manner. It is obvious that the manner in which the common good is best subserved is not a matter that can be measured by any constitutional yardstick - it would depend on the economic and political philosophy of the government. Revenue maximization is not the only way in which the common good can be subserved. Where revenue maximization is the object of a policy, being considered qua that resource at that point of time to be the best way to subserve the common good, auction would be one of the preferable methods, though not the only method. Where revenue maximization is not the object of a policy of distribution, the question of auction would not arise. Revenue considerations may assume secondary consideration to developmental considerations. "
1
Confrontation with Governments.
As a part of his duty, Rai has many a times raised questions on faulty policy making of several state governments and Union government run by Congress led United Progressive Alliance and BJP led Governments in Chhattisgarh and Gujarat. He had slammed the Union government in the allocation of spectrum for 2G mobile use to telecom operators, conduct of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, running of its flagship rural employment guarantee scheme and the spending by Reliance Industries in an oil block. He had also pointed out improprieties in allocating coal blocks, and Union government's overt generosity to GMR in an airport project and Reliance Power in a power plant. CAG slammed govt of Goa for forest policy delay, Haryana govt for loss of over due to "deficiency" in imposing taxes like sales tax on goods, stamp duty and registration fee in land deals and taxes on vehicles in more than 4,000 cases in a year.
There are certain times when ministers of ruling Congress coalition government criticised CAG. Minister of state in PMO, V. Narayanasamy said "CAG has no authority or right to comment on the policy of the government but unfortunately it has questioned its authority, which is totally unwarranted and against the mandate given to them". However CAG Vinod Rai defended his position by stating at an Economic Editor’s Conference in 2011 “I am making it clear that I do not think the CAG is exceeding its jurisdiction, because the basic responsibility of the CAG is to identify if there is any lapse.” and challenged the government to identify the specific breach of mandate.
Awards and recognition.
He figured as one of the Persons of the Year in Forbes magazine January 2011.
In December 2011, he was chosen as the chief of UN external audit panel.
In February 2012, CAG was complimented for professionalism, training and infrastructure by its US counterpart.

USS Wapasha (YN-45)

USS "Wapasha" (YN-45), later YNT-13, later YTB-787, was a United States Navy net tender, later large harbor tug, in commission from 1941 to 1947.
"Wapasha" was built as the steel-hulled, single-screw tug "William J. Moran", completed in September 1938 at Bay City, Michigan, by the Defoe Boat and Motor Works, Inc.. "William J. Moran" was acquired by the U.S. Navy from the Moran Towing and Transportation Company of New York City, 9 December 1940. The tug was classified as a yard net tender, renamed USS "Wapasha", and designated YN-45 on 25 December 1940. Converted for naval use at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, "Wapasha" was placed in service on 27 January 1941.
"Wapasha" was allocated to the 1st Naval District at Boston, Massachusetts, which became her home port. After shifting to Boston on 1 February 1941, she took up her net tending duties in Narragansett Bay, based at Naval Training Center Newport at Newport, Rhode Island. During her service there, which lasted into 1947, she was twice reclassified: on 8 April 1942 she was reclassified a tug-class net tender and redesignated YNT-13 and, on 4 August 1945, she was reclassified a large harbor tug and redesignated YTB-737.
Placed out of service on 11 February 1947, Wapasha was struck from the Navy List on 11 March 1947 and turned over to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 16 May 1947. Acquired by Tug Anne Moran, Inc., of New York City, the vessel was renamed "Anne Moran" and performed harbor tug services in New York Harbor. She was sold in 1976 to Solvent Tanker Corporation of Staten Island, New York, and renamed "Yankee". She later was sold again, to Eklof Marine Corporation of Staten Island.

The Malone Area Heritage Museum is a historical museum in Malone, Wisconsin, United States. The museum documents the history of immigrants into the Holyland region of Wisconsin. The museum is affiliated with the Wisconsin Historical Society. It has been in existence since 2005. It is open to the public on Thursday afternoons between 2:00 and 4:00 pm and on the second Sunday of each month.
Displays.
The museum consists of two buildings. Both were purchased from Malone's co-op. One is the original train depot for Malone, which was moved across the street to its present location in early 2005. Had the building not been moved, it would have been dismantled because it was in the way of large trucks. It documents the development and usage of the Sheboygan - Fond du Lac railroad. There is a piece of the original railroad that was dug up in a local field. The building is the final remaining depot from that line. The other building is a more recently purchased agricultural shop which is being adapted for displaying items as of 2008. Both buildings contain artifacts from activities common in the area, especially farming.

Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi

Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi (Arabic: موسى بن موسى القسوي) 
("Circa" 790 – 26 September 862) was leader of the muwallad Banu Qasi clan and ruler of a semi-autonomous principality in the upper Ebro valley in northern Iberia in the 9th century.
Rise.
Musa ibn Musa was great-grandson of Cassius, who converted to Islam after the Muslim conquest of Iberia. His father, Musa ibn Fortun, appears in scattered accounts of the late 8th century, and was apparently assassinated in Musa’s youth. His mother, whose name is unknown, was also mother by another husband of Basque chieftain Íñigo Arista, Musa’s half-brother. 
Musa’s early years are obscure, although he is presumed to have supported the Basques against the French in the Second Battle of Ronceveaux, a battle generally credited as giving birth to the nascent Kingdom of Pamplona. Likewise it is claimed that in 839 his son Fortun ibn Musa led a campaign that resulted in a rout of the "king of the Galicians", "Loderik" or "Luzriq" and he leveled the defenses of Alava.
Rebellion.
It is in 840/1 that we first hear of Musa ibn Musa himself. In response to attacks on the lands of his half-brother, Íñigo Arista, and the expulsion of kinsman Abd al-Yabbar ibn Qasi by the brothers Abd Allah and Amir ibn Kalayb, governors respectively of Zaragoza and Tudela, Musa and Íñigo rose in rebellion against emir Abd ar-Rahman II. This led to a reprisal campaign under the leadership of the emir's son, Mutarrif, and general Abd al-Wahid ibn Yezid Iskenderani. In 842, Musa was in charge of the vanguard of the emir's army marching against Cerdaña, but believing himself mistreated by the commanding general, Musa again rebelled and along with his nephew, García Íñiguez of Pamplona, defeated a Cordoban army. Musa ibn Musa and Íñigo Arista again joined forces to ambush and capture one of Abd ar-Rahman's commanders in 843, but the consequence was a massive military response from Cordoba, led by the Emir in person, resulting in the defeat of the allies and the taking of slaves in the vicinity of Pamplona. A second retaliatory expedition in 844 inflicted a further defeat, in which Musa's half-brother Fortún Íñiguez, the premier soldier of Pamplona, was killed and Musa and Íñigo barely escaped, while hundreds of the Pamplona nobility defected to the Cordoban side. Musa submitted and in November led his troops to Seville, helping to rout a viking raiding party. However, he again rebelled the next year. When Muhammad, son of Abd ar-Rahman, took Tudela, Musa submitted, and his son Lubb ibn Musa, along with nephew Galindo Íñiguez, went to the emir’s court. In 846 Musa again was forced to submit, this time to the emir's son Hisham, but Abd ar-Rahman was again forced to launch punitive campaigns against Musa in 847, and in 850 when Musa and Íñigo again joined in rebellion, Musa's son Ismail ibn Musa playing a critical role in the uprising.
Third King of Spain.
The Islamic year 237 (851/2) proved critical for Musa ibn Musa. In this year his half-brother and repeated ally in rebellion, Íñigo Arista, died, as did the emir, Abd er-Rahman II. Musa also gained a great victory in a two-day battle, defeating Basque or Gascon forces near Albelda. The next year, Musa’s control over his territories and his links to the emirate were formalized, the new emir, Muhammad, naming Musa Wāli of Zaragoza and governor of the March. The next decade marked the height of his power. He would control Zaragoza, Tudela, Huesca and Toledo, forming what was, in effect, a Taifa state stretching from Najera to Zaragoza and Calatayud, and viewed as equivalent to the emirate of Cordoba and the kingdom of Asturias, Musa being referred to as “The Third King of Spain”.
In 854, Toledo rebelled, supported by Ordoño I of Asturias and García Íñiguez, and the emir Muhammad launched a punitive campaign which ended in the Battle of Guadalacete, Musa apparently participating on Cordoba’s behalf. The next year Musa led a Cordoban attack on Alava, and in 856 he launched an independent expedition against Barcelona and Terrassa. Apparently in 859, Musa’s son Lope ibn Musa ibn Qasi was appointed Wali of Toledo, and the same year, Musa permitted a viking force to pass through his lands to attack Pamplona, where they captured Musa’s nephew and former ally García Íñiguez and ransomed him for either 70,000 or 90,000 gold dinars. This further soured relations between the kinsmen, and García joined with Ordoño in an assault on Musa’s lands, which led to a second battle at Albelda. The Christians divided their forces, besieging the town and pursuing Musa’a army to a refuge on Mount Laturce. They dealt Musa a crushing defeat, killing his son-in-law, an otherwise unknown Basque prince García, and forcing Musa to flee. This victory would be remembered in Christian sources in the form of the legendary Battle of Clavijo.
Decline and Death.
The Christian victory at Albeda led to the end of Musa’s autonomy. In 860, emir Muhammad removed Musa as wali and governor, and personally led an army through Musa’a lands on a month-long punitive campaign against Pamplona which resulted in the capture of prince Fortún Garcés of Pamplona. In 861 Muhammad required Musa to play a subservient role in a campaign against Barcelona. The next year, 862, saw Musa trying to re-exert his power, directing a military show of force against his son-in-law, the Berber Izraq ibn Mantel ibn Salim (). Musa attacked Guadalajara, but received several wounds, being unable to mount a horse. He withdrew to Tudela, where he died 26 September 862.
Family.
Musa ibn Musa is reported by the Códice de Roda to have married a daughter of his half-brother Íñigo Arista. She was not his only wife, as he also married a cousin Maymuna (), daughter of his father's brother, who was mother of his younger son Ismael. No source reports the mother of his other sons: Lubb, Mutarrif and Fortun. He had at least two daughters; Auria (, "Awriyah"), wife of Basque prince García who was killed at Mount Laturce, by him having a son Musa ibn Garsiya; and another daughter, "the most beautiful girl in Al Andalus", married to Izraq ibn Mantel.
Legacy.
The death of Musa led to a decade long disappearance of the family from the political scene, but they returned to rule over a shrinking territory for another half-century. However, their position between the growing powers of the caliphate to the south and the Christian principalities to the north proved untenable, and after three generations of varied success, the leaders of the family, Musa’s great-great grandsons, were displaced, exiled or killed by the end of the 920s and the last vestiges of Musa's principality disappeared. His pseudo-autonomy from a Cordoba unable to maintain direct control foreshadowed the muwallad rebels of the early 10th century, and the later Taifa kingdoms.

The series was aired on ATV in 2009 in Hong Kong under the title "Yunzhuan Tianxia" (運轉天下; literally: "Luck Changes the World").
Story.
The story begins with the Che family business in the Qing Dynasty. The head of the business was mother Yugui. She had fixed her daughter Jiaoyan's marriage so that she end up with someone who was more financially stable. The daughter however was extremely unhappy since the fixed husband was fat and unattractive. The daughter was actually in love with the poor coolie boy A'long. However society would not allow a girl of reputable social status to marry a boy of low social status. The oldest brother of the family Che Weiren later committed a murder. He has been spoiled by the family riches. When the government was looking for the murderer, the coolie boy A'long innocently admitted to the crime so the brother didn't have to go to prison.
Eventually the house got weak in morale. A fisherman named Gao Lixiang came in to help the Che family business. At first he was looked down upon due to his low society status. Soon he figured out how to dye clothes. He single handed won an imperial clothing competition by making through the obstacle course with his dyed clothes. The Che family was surprised that a simple fisherman could beat the business.
Then one day a major fire broke out in a restaurant and Lixiang saved a daughter and a westerner from the crisis. The daughter turned out to be from the competing Wang family business. She tried to lure him into their family claiming the Che family treats him unfairly. After a number of business competitions he was gaining more respect in the Che family. Eventually the siblings got jealous and tried to get Lixiang kicked out of the household. Eventually the mother made Lixiang the head of the business, since he was most capable.
Eventually the business was in trouble from all the competition. But the westerner who was saved in the fire came back with a bunch of goods from the west such as magnifying glass and music boxes. They started selling western goods and the business improved again, since no one else have seen these merchandise. Later the family went into a feud between the oldest son Che Weiren and Lixiang. In setting Lixiang up, the oldest son killed an outsider, Bai Biao, who later turned out to be his own genetic father.
After a number of twists Lixiang was promoted to be the chairman of the business association above all businesses, but he was put in the chairman position because the government official liked his former fiancée Yang Danping. The oldest brother in the family soon developed a deep jealousy over the Lixiang's success who now owns his family business, his girlfriend Xu Xiaoman and his mother's trust. He sank into depression with opium addictions, and was later bribed by a government official to sell out his whole family business in exchange for unlimited opium. The mother of the family ended up in prison having been set up by the government officials. But her kids did not stand by her since they experienced too much hardship during their childhood. Lixiang ended up rescuing the family business, but soon finds the business to be unmanageable. Worse is that the mother who ran the business indirectly murdered his parents earlier. The story experience more twists and turns eventually to include the death of Qing government officials.
Cuisine reference.
The show featured a dish called Squirrel whole jumping fish (松鼠活魚) from Wuzhen. The fish is cooked in a rather cruel way where the head is alive while the body is fried. If cooked correctly however, the mouth continues to move/talk even after the dish is finished. It does not contain any squirrel contrary to the name.

Edward Joseph "Eddie" Giroux (July 4, 1883 — May 26, 1930) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player best known for being the only 20-year-old to have competed in the 1904 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Giroux played as a goaltender.
Career.
Giroux began his hockey career at a young age. Little was known about him until his debut appearance in the Stanley Cup playoffs in February 1904, at the age of 20, while playing for Toronto Marlboros. Toronto played against the Ottawa Silver Seven, who beat Toronto in the first game 6-3 and 11-2 in the second game (best-of-three format).
In 1904, Giroux left the Marlboros and signed with the Kenora Thistles in 1905. Kenora played for the Stanley Cup, but lost two games to one to Ottawa.
In January 1907 Kenora again played for the Stanley Cup, and with Giroux in net, Kenora defeated the Montreal Wanderers 12-8 over two games to win. Each player received a gold-plated cup for winning the Stanley Cup. Giroux was in net when Kenora defeated Brandon on March 16 and 18, to win the Manitoba Championship and retained the Stanley Cup. However, about a week later the Montreal Wanderers regained the Stanley Cup from Kenora in two games in Winnipeg.
Because Kenora was unable to compete with other professional teams, it folded in 1908, and Giroux retired as a player. When Kenora challenged the Winnipeg Victorias for the Allan Cup in March 1911, Giroux officiated along with long-time friend Tommy Phillips. Winnipeg won the Allan Cup, out scoring Kenora 12-5.

Sunrise International Unitization Agreement

This agreement is officially known as the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste relating to the Unitisation of the Sunrise and Troubadour Fields. 
The Sunrise International Unitisation Agreement (Sunrise IUA) was made to enable the exploitation of the Sunrise and Troubador petroleum and gas fields in the Timor Sea, together known as the Greater Sunrise field, which straddle the border between the joint petroleum development area (JPDA) established under the Timor Sea Treaty and Australian territorial waters as determined by the 1972 seabed boundary agreement between Australia and Indonesia. Unitisation of the field would enable it to be treated as one as far as exploitation, regulation, revenue taxation, management and others purposes are concerned, giving certainty to investors by providing a financial framework and international legal basis for development of the field.
The agreement deemed 20.1% of the resources of the Greater Sunrise field as lying within the JPDA, attributing 20.1% of production from it to the JPDA and 79.9% to Australia. With East Timor getting 90% of the revenue of the JPDA, it effectively was only going to receive 18.1% of the revenue from the field. This share ratio was amended to both Australia and East Timor getting equal share of the upstream revenue from the field with the signing of the Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) in 2006. By virtue of this, this agreement is "read together" with CMATS and the Timor Sea Treaty.
The Sunrise IUA was signed in Dili, East Timor on 6 March 2003 by then Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer and Ana Pessoa, East Timor's Minister of State for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. The agreement came into force on 23 February 2007 by virtue of the coming to force of CMATS on the same day.

Reggie McNamara

Reggie McNamara (born Grenfell, New South Wales, Australia, 1887, died Belleville, New Jersey, United States, October, 1970 or 1971 or 1972) was an Australian cyclist known as a roughhouse velodrome rider with a string of dramatic crashes and broken bones over 20 years. He was known as the Iron Man. He specialised in six-day races but rode races from 200m sprints to 100 km endurance races. He rode 3,000 races on three continents over 30 years and won more than 700 before he retired aged 50 in 1937.
Background.
Reggie McNamara grew up in the Australian countryside, the son of a sheep rancher. A snake bit him on a finger when he was 12 and hunting rabbits with his brother. He and his brother chopped off the finger with an axe. He and his 13 brothers and sisters learned to ride on the same bicycle. He began racing for money in local fairs around Sydney, shooting kangaroos and selling their skins to raise the entry fee. Some reports say he was 14, others 16.
He won his first race, over a mile and a half on a dirt track, and travelled across Australia and New Zealand to wherever he could find races. He won the Sydney six-day race at the start of 1913 and caught the eye of Alf Goullet, an Australian international who had been asked to find two good Australians to race in Newark, New Jersey, USA. Goullet signed just McNamara, telling the historian Peter Nye that McNamara was worth any two other riders.
International career.
McNamara went to the USA and took American nationality when he married an Irish nurse, Elizabeth McDonough in 1913, whom he had met after breaking a leg during his first training ride. They had two daughters, Eileen and Regina. McNamara set five world records from one to 25 miles at Newark velodrome in 1915, 1916 and 1917. He won seven six-day races at Madison Square Garden in New York between 1918 and 1932, another five at the Chicago Coliseum and other six-day races in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and England. He won the 1932 Madison Square Garden six-day at the age of 45. His winnings up to 1933 reached the modern equivalent of at least A$2 000 000.
McNamara was known for spectacular crashes on the steep wooden tracks. He crashed up to 20 times in some "sixes".
An American newspaper reported:
To undergo a serious operation on the fourth day of a six-day race and then finish the contest and run third, less than a wheel's length behind the winner, is going some. But that is what Reggie McNamara did and he did it against the advice of doctors, his family and the rider who was his mate in the race. So often has this fellow pulled through tight places solely on his nerve he has been dubbed the "Iron Man" of cycling.
It was in the Melbourne, Australia, six day race two years ago that McNamara jumped off his wheel, had an incision several inches long made in his side and then resumed the race after more than a dozen stitches were taken to bring the gap together. An abscess the size of a tennis ball was removed, and, although the rider lost considerable blood, he started a sprint immediately upon going on the track to relieve his partner, who was little Jackie Clark, one of the greatest of all six-day riders. No anaesthetic was used in the operation which shows the iron nerve possessed by the cyclist. During the painful operation the "Iron Man" never winced, ignoring his own troubles, he enquired continually about Clark, who was in poor condition and riding none too well.
By 1946 McNamara calculated he had broken his collarbone 17 times, his skull, nose and leg once each, his jaw in three places. He had needed 500 surgical stitches and suffered concussion five times. He had 47 scars, "one of them, running along his right cheek, gives his dark and friendly face a dangerous look which he enhances by wearing black sweaters and scowling."
When a reporter asked McNamara if he parted his hair down the middle because movie star Rudolph Valentino did, he shook his head:
The American magazine, "Time", described him as "a friendly, mild-mannered man with a deep scar in his right cheek." Peter Nye said:
He distinguished himself by winning the Square Garden's six-days in March and December in 1926, but only after narrowly averting disaster. In the final 15 minutes during the heat of the action in December when McNamara and his partner, Pietro Linari of Italy, were trading places, both were caught in a spectacular high-speed crash. They were knocked out cold. McNamara was the first to regain his senses. He staggered to retrieve his bicycle and told the doctor, "If my legs are all right, I'm going back in." He got back on his bike to win the race. Afterward, he discovered he had cracked three ribs.
McNamara won his 19th and final six-day victory in Cleveland, USA, in January 1933. His partner, Norman Hill, was 26 and born the year McNamara began racing.
Retirement.
The Depression and then the war ended the six-day circuit in the USA. McNamara was already 45 when he rode his last six-day. He worked as a race official while the races lasted and then in a school kitchen. He wrote his life story but failed to find a publisher. He died at 83 of a stroke in Belleville, survived by his wife, daughters, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
Peter Nye said:
He is credited in "VeloPlus", the Belgian reference book, with 19 six-day victories and finishing 108 sixes. He still ranks in "VeloPlus"'s all-time top 25 six-day racers. Considering that he pedalled about 1,250 miles in each six-day, he churned some 135,000 racing miles in his career - more than enough to commute five times around the globe.
Drugs.
The journalist René de Latour, who worked as McNamara's track manager for several years, said of a chase at the Velodrome d'Hiver in Paris:
Anecdote.
The magazine "Time" believed in 1932 that it had found another Iron Man. It reported:
Most celebrated of McNamara's confreres is Franco Georgetti, a small knock-kneed Italian who finished a sulky last in last week's race, but failed to butt his head against a wall for losing as he did once. Obviously heir to Iron McNamara, Georgetti was once pierced by an eight-inch splinter which he sent to his father to be exhibited. He earns $28,000 per year, has a barber shave him every day of the race, frequently dines on rice, lobster and beer with Tenor Benjiamino Gigli of the Metropolitan Opera Company.

The son of Wapasha (I), Wapasha (II) took the place of his noble father as a mighty war chief, in present day Minnesota. 
He lost his eye in a game of lacross, some say instead of getting an eyepatch he grew out his hair. 
He sided with the United States in the War of 1812 and the Black Hawk War.

WJZ-FM

WJZ-FM (105.7 FM) is a radio station licensed to Catonsville, Maryland, and broadcasting from studios in suburban Towson, Maryland. The station is owned by CBS Radio.
History.
History of the WJZ-FM callsign.
The call letters WJZ-FM were originally used on what is now WPLJ in New York City from its founding in 1948 to 1953 when the station became WABC-FM, alongside WABC-TV and WABC-AM.
The call letters "WJZ" were originally created by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the direct predecessor to the current CBS Corporation, which was the owners of WJZ radio in New York City from 1921 to 1923. The WJZ call sign has been used in Baltimore since 1957, when WAAM (channel 13) was renamed to WJZ-TV, an ABC affiliate that was changed to CBS in 1995.
As WBMD-FM.
WJZ-FM signed on in 1961 as WBMD-FM. The station was purchased in the late '60s by Key Broadcasting. The FM station was paired with a country AM station, WBMD, already owned by Key. In 1970, the FM's format became hard rock at night, with country during the day. On July 5, 1971, the station's call sign was changed to WKTK and the format shifted to all progressive rock music. From 1977 to 1979, WKTK played disco music, but later changed to oldies with the decline of disco. In 1982, the call letters became WQSR as the station planned to join Super Radio, a new national music network to be operated by ABC. Shortly before Super Radio's scheduled launch, ABC decided not to go forward with the network. WQSR kept its new call letters. WQSR was then sold to Sconnix Broadcasting in 1988 and continued playing oldies music. The station was sold to Infinity Radio in 1993, then passed on to CBS Radio in 1997.
WXYV and revival of WHFS.
On September 8, 2001, at 6 AM, WQSR moved to WXYV's 102.7 FM frequency to broadcast on a better signal. After two days of simulcasting, 105.7 FM became the new home for WXYV, with a mainstream urban format known as "X105.7." (X105.7 marked WXYV's second stint as an Urban station; the first incarnation was known as "V103", which flipped to CHR/Top-40 and became "102.7XYV" in 1997, and was then re-branded as "B102.7" in 1998, with the same CHR/Top-40 format.) The call letter swap between the two stations became official 4 days later. Both stations were owned by Infinity Broadcasting (now CBS Radio). The morning show was a simulcast of former V103 personality Frank Ski's morning show, originating from WVEE (also known as "V103", but located on the 103.3 frequency) in Atlanta. However, X105.7 failed to compete against WERQ-FM, which resulted in WXYV flipping to hot talk on March 10, 2003. The station was an affiliate for Howard Stern and the Don and Mike Show. The station adopted the name "Live 105.7", which would later change to "105.7 Free FM" in 2006, and then "Baltimore's FM Talk 105.7" in 2007 after CBS phased out the Free FM branding nationwide.
Meanwhile, Infinity Broadcasting saw an unexpected public reaction to their decision to change the format of 99.1 FM in Washington. The story was covered by local TV stations for many days afterwards, and mentioned nationally by "The Washington Post", "The Howard Stern Show", and "The Today Show". The corporate offices of Infinity Broadcasting in New York City were flooded with phone calls and e-mails from irate listeners. An online petition protesting the format change gathered tens of thousands of signatures in only a few days. Media attention was attracted by a public protest in downtown Washington, outside a skate shop where WHFS maintained a remote storefront studio in its last few months. WHFS' main competitor, DC101, paid tribute to the station, airing many memories of WHFS from its DJs and listeners.
Infinity Broadcasting responded by resurrecting the WHFS format on nights and weekends at 105.7, beginning at 7 p.m. on January 21, 2005 with former WHFS afternoon DJ Tim Virgin. The station rebranded itself as "The Legendary HFS, Live on 105.7"; Infinity Broadcasting moved the WHFS call letters to the station days later. 'HFS was pulled from the airwaves again on February 1, 2007, immediately before KMS on HFS premiered, yet retained the WHFS call letters traditionally associated with the music the station used to broadcast. Currently, HFS2 and Locals Only with Neci remain WHFS's only ties to its original format.
105.7 the Fan.
On November 3, 2008, WHFS flipped to a sports talk format, similar to that of sister station WFAN in New York City. Along with the format change came a new callsign: WJZ-FM. The new station has Ed Norris in the morning drive, Mark Viviano and Damon "Bulldog" Yaffe from 9 AM to 12 PM, WBFF sports director Bruce Cunningham from 12 to 2 PM, and Scott Garceau and Jeremy Conn from 2 to 6 PM. WJZ-FM retained WHFS' status as the flagship radio station for Baltimore Orioles baseball and co-flagship for Maryland Terrapins football and men's basketball. The WHFS call sign landed on 1580 AM (formerly WPGC) one week later. Orioles broadcasts moved from WJZ-FM back to WBAL (which WHFS had replaced as flagship in 2007) in 2011.
HFS2.
In 2006, WHFS began to broadcast a digital signal for radios using the new HD Radio technology, and launched an all-music station named "HFS2" on its second HD Radio channel. The station focuses primarily on new alternative rock and indie rock, and currently has no DJs or commercials. On January 19, 2007, the online stream of "HFS2" was launched with the slogan "What You've Been Missing" hinting at the death of HFS music on the regular 105.7 frequency.
On Thursday, November 1, 2007, Neci Crowder began broadcasting on HFS2 from 8am to 1 pm. This marked the first time a live DJ has been heard on HFS2.
