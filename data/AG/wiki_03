This allowed Grosscup to return to New York, this time with the New York Titans of the American Football League. He began the season as the starter, but missed six weeks with a knee injury. Grosscup was cut on the final day of the 1963 preseason and signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders three days later. That same year, Groscup released his first book, entitled "Fourth and One". 
After failing to make the San Francisco 49ers, Grossup spent the 1964 season on the Oakland Raiders' taxi squad. He was cut by the Raiders the following season and signed with the Hartford Charter Oaks of the newly formed Continental Football League.

From 1989-2003, Grosscup was the radio analyst for California Golden Bears football broadcasts. He was let go in 2004 in favor of former Cal quarterback Mike Pawlawski, despite Grosscup's willingness to continue until 2007.

They Flew Alone (released in the US as "Wings and the Woman") is a 1942 British biopic about aviator Amy Johnson, directed and produced by Herbert Wilcox and starring Anna Neagle, Robert Newton and Edward Chapman. It was distributed in the UK and the US by RKO Radio Pictures.
Synopsis.
The film chronicled the life of Amy Johnson, the British pilot who had gained world attention in the 1930s for her exploits, among them two solo record flights from London to Cape Town in South Africa, and who had joined the Air Transport Auxiliary at the outbreak of the Second World War. It was intended to be both a film honouring Johnson, who had died in 1941 during a ferry flight of an Airspeed Oxford, and a propaganda call to arms at the height of the war years.

Rock cake

A rock cake, also called a rock bun, is a small, hard fruit cake with a rough surface resembling a rock.
Rock cakes originated in Great Britain, where they are a traditional teatime treat, but are now popular in many parts of the world. They were promoted by the Ministry of Food during the Second World War since they require fewer eggs and less sugar than ordinary cakes, an important savings in a time of strict rationing. Traditional recipes bulked them with oatmeal, which was more readily available than white flour.
Recipe.
A typical modern recipe for 12 cakes requires about 200 g of flour, 100 g of butter or margarine, 50 g of sugar, 1 beaten egg, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 2 tablespoons of milk, 150 g of dried fruit such as currants, raisins, candied orange peel, etc., and a pinch of nutmeg and mixed spices. Usually, flour and butter are first mixed until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs; then the other ingredients are added to create a stiff dough, which is dropped from a spoon to a baking tray or roughly formed with two forks. The cakes (optionally sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon) are baked for about 15 minutes at 200 °C, retaining an uneven form and contour.
Variations include the Jamaican rock bun, which is similar but can include grated coconut, and the traditional British rock cake, which contains oatmeal.
In popular culture.
Rock cakes are mentioned as an alternative to doughnuts in the 1940 British film "Night Train to Munich". They are also a common feature in the popular "Harry Potter" series of books and films.
In the Benny Hill song "Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)" – performed first on television in 1970, later released as a single in 1971 in the UK – Ernie is killed by a rock cake below the heart and a pork pie to the face. In the British soap opera Eastenders they are stocked in the local cafe and Tamwar Masood frequently eats them as an alternative to pastries.
Early in "The African Queen," Mr. Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) was at tea with Rose and the Rev. Samuel Sayer. His stomach is growling and Rose (Samuel's sister) offers him a rock cake.

2008 Lexus Cup

The 2008 Lexus Cup was a professional women's golf event contested by two teams of 12 members each: one representing Asian countries and the other representing the rest of the world, known as the "International" team. Since the event's inception in 2005, it has been sanctioned by the world's dominant women's professional golf tour, the LPGA Tour in the U.S., although it is an unofficial event in which no earnings by the competitors affect their positions on the LPGA money list.
The competition took place on the Bukit Course at The Singapore Island Country Club in Singapore from November 28–30, 2008. Lexus was the title sponsor; Rolex, DBS, Singapore Airlines, Callaway Golf, and Singapore Sports Council were main sponsors.
This was the last official LPGA appearance for Team International captain Annika Sörenstam, who had previously announced her retirement at the end of the 2008 season.
Teams.
As in the similar team events of the Solheim Cup (USA vs. Europe women), Ryder Cup (USA vs. Europe men), and Presidents Cup, each team is made up of twelve players. Four players for Team Asia and four for Team International earn sports through the Rolex Rankings. Four additional players for each team qualified through their position on the LPGA Official Money List, as of November 2, 2008. Once the top eight players for each team were confirmed, four additional players—two captain's picks and two sponsor's exemptions—were selected for each team.

Angels of Bataan

The Angels of Bataan (also known as the "Angels of Bataan and Corregidor" and "The Battling Belles of Bataan") were the members of the United States Army Nurse Corps and the United States Navy Nurse Corps who were stationed in the Philippines at the outset of the Pacific War and served during the Battle of the Philippines (1941–42). When Bataan and Corregidor fell, 11 Navy nurses, 66 army nurses, and 1 nurse-anesthetist were captured and imprisoned in and around Manila. They continued to serve as a nursing unit throughout their status as prisoners of war. After years of hardship, they were finally liberated in February 1945.
In Manila.
At the outset of World War II, US Army and US Navy nurses were stationed at Sternberg General Hospital in Manila, and other military hospitals around Manila. During the Battle of the Philippines (1941–42), eighty-eight US Army nurses escaped, in the last week of December 1941, to Corregidor and Bataan. Two Army nurses, Lt. Floramund A. Fellmeth and Lt. Florence MacDonald, accompanied severely wounded patients from Sternberg aboard the improvised hospital ship "Mactan" that departed Manila shortly after midnight of the New Year of 1942 for Australia.
The navy nurses, under the command of Lt. Laura M. Cobb, stayed behind in Manila during the initial invasion to support the patients there. One of them, Ann A. Bernatitus, escaped from Manila to Bataan just before Manila fell. The remaining 11 navy nurses were captured upon the fall of Manila and interned by the Japanese at Santo Tomas.
The Army nurses, under the command of Capt. Maude Davison, together with Navy nurse Bernatitus, escaped from Manila and went on to serve in the Battle of Bataan and the Battle of Corregidor.
On Bataan.
In late December 1941, many of the nurses were assigned to a pair of battlefield hospitals on Bataan named Hospital #1 and Hospital #2. These hospitals included the first open-air wards in US history since the Civil War. Tropical diseases, including malaria and dysentery, were widespread among both hospital patients and staff.
Just prior to the fall of Bataan on 9 April 1942, the nurses serving there were ordered to the island fortress of Corregidor by General Wainwright (commander of the forces in the Philippines after MacArthur was ordered to Australia).
On Corregidor.
During the Battle of Corregidor, the nurses were stationed in the hospital and wards in the maze of underground tunnels connected to the Malinta Tunnel.
A Few Escape.
On 29 April, a small group of Army nurses were evacuated, with other passengers, aboard a navy PBY Catalina. On 3 May, the sole Navy nurse, Ann Bernatitus, a few more Army nurses, and a small group of civilians were evacuated aboard the submarine .
Fall of Corregidor.
When Corregidor fell to Japanese forces under the command of General Masaharu Homma on 6 May, the remaining nurses were captured and — on 2 July — transferred to the Santo Tomas Internment Camp.
Internment.
At Santo Tomas.
The campus of the University of Santo Tomas was converted to an internment camp by the Japanese during their occupation of the Philippines. The camp is described in detail in "The War" by Ken Burns. In addition to its civilian population, Santo Tomas became the initial internment camp for both the army and navy nurses, with the army nurses remaining there until their liberation.
Capt. Maude C. Davison, 57 years old and with 20 years of service experience, took command of the nurses, maintained a regular schedule of nursing duty, and insisted that all nurses wear their khaki blouses and skirts while on duty.
At Los Baños.
In May 1943, the navy nurses, still under the command of Lt. Cobb, were transferred to a new internment camp at Los Baños, where they established a new infirmary and continued working as a nursing unit. At Los Baños they came to be known as "the sacred eleven."
On the Home Front.
While the capture of the nurses was widely publicized in the U.S., little specific information was known of their fate until they were liberated.
Lt. Juanita Redmond, one of the few nurses to escape, published a memoir of her experiences on Bataan in 1943 that concluded with a dramatic reminder that her colleagues were still prisoners. The nurses' story was dramatized in several wartime movies, including:
When "So Proudly We Hail" was shown in the theaters, a recruitment booth staffed with Red Cross volunteers was set up in the lobby.
Final year of Internment.
In January 1944, control of the Santo Tomas Internment Camp changed from Japanese civil authorities to the Imperial Japanese Army, with whom it remained until the camp was liberated. Access to outside food sources was curtailed, the diet of the internees was reduced to 960 calories per person per day by November 1944, and further reduced to 700 calories per person per day by January 1945.
A Department of Veterans Affairs study released in April, 2002 found that the nurses lost, on average, 30% of their body weight during internment, and subsequently experienced a degree of service-connected disability "virtually the same as the male ex-POW's of the Pacific Theater." Maude C. Davison's body weight dropped from 156 lbs. to 80 lbs.
Liberation.
Emboldened by the success of the Raid at Cabanatuan, General Douglas MacArthur ordered Major General Vernon D. Mudge to make an aggressive raid on Santo Tomas in the Battle of Manila (1945). The internees at Santo Tomas, including the nurses, were liberated on 3 February 1945, by a "flying column" of the 1st Cavalry.
The navy nurses were subsequently liberated in the Raid at Los Baños.
Upon returning to the U.S., the US Army awarded their nurses, among other decorations, the Bronze Star for valor and a Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism in action. The Navy nurses were likewise awarded Bronze Stars upon their return.
Memorial and Recognition.
On April 9, 1980, a bronze plaque was dedicated at the Mount Samat shrine by men who survived Bataan and Corregidor. It reads: 
"TO THE ANGELS-- In honor of the valiant American military women who gave so much of themselves in the early days of World War II. They provided care and comfort to the gallant defenders of Bataan and Corregidor. They lived on a starvation diet, shared the bombing, strafing, sniping, sickness and disease while working endless hours of heartbreaking duty. These nurses always had a smile, a tender touch and a kind word for their patients. They truly earned the name--THE ANGELS OF BATAAN AND CORREGIDOR.""
Maj. Maude C. Davison, credited by many for keeping the army nurses alive by her insistence on the nurses maintaining their identity as nurses throughout their internment, was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal on August 20, 2001. A similar effort has not yet been undertaken for Chief Nurse Laura M. Cobb.

The touch screen is infrared which allows multiple simultaneous input during gameplay.
Gameplay.
The game offers 4 gameplay types:
The player has 60 seconds to pick a song. If the timer hits zero, the song currently highlighted will be chosen.
The player must touch the notes as the time line crosses them. If they fail to touch them after the time line passes them, it counts as a break, which means the combo is reset to zero and the player loses HP, which is also recovered when notes are hit. When the player's HP decreases to zero, the game ends.
The game has 4 types of note charts:
When compared to the charts of the PSP DJMax Games, Popular, Technical, and Special Patterns are the Technika equivalent of Normal Style, Hard Style, and MX Style note charts respectively, and Lite pattern is the Technika equivalent of Easy Style in the early DJMax Online game.
Note Types:
Platinum Crew.
Pentavision released ID Cards in different packages that grant access to the Platinum Mixing mode. Players will be able to access personal information management, online regional rankings, buy items for their accounts, and play against other DJMax players.

Bacterial anaerobic corrosion

Bacterial anaerobic corrosion is a bacterially-induced oxidation of metals.
In a humid environment and anoxic conditions the corrosion of metals occurs as a result of a redox reaction that generates molecular hydrogen from hydrogen ions, requiring bacteria, unlike anaerobic corrosion that occurs spontaneously. 
A base metal, such as iron (Fe) goes into aqueous solution as positively charged cation, Fe2+. As the metal is oxidized under anaerobic condition by the protons of water, H+ ions are reduced to form molecular H2. This can be written in the following ways under acidic and neutral conditions respectively:
Usually, a thin film of molecular hydrogen forms on the metal. Sulfate-reducing bacteria, oxidize the molecular hydrogen to produce hydrogen sulfide ions (HS−) and water:
The iron ions partly precipitate to from iron (II) sulfide. A reaction with water also occurs, producing iron hydroxide.
The net equation comes to:
This form of corrosion by sulfate-reducing bacteria can, in this way, be far more harmful than anaerobic corrosion.

Charles Oakes

Charles William Oakes (30 November 1861 – 2 July 1928) was an Australian politician. Born in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, he was educated at state schools in Sydney, after which he became a jeweller and watchmaker. He was involved in local politics as a member of Paddington Council. In 1901, he was elected as a Liberal Reformist to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Paddington; he served as an honorary minister from 1907 until 1910, when he left the Assembly. In 1913, he was elected to the Australian Senate as a Commonwealth Liberal Party Senator from New South Wales; he was not re-elected in the double dissolution election the following year. Oakes returned to state politics, winning the Legislative Assembly seat of Waverley as a Nationalist in 1917, serving again as an honorary minister from 1919. He lost his seat again in 1920, but was elected as one of the members for Eastern Suburbs in 1922. He was Colonial Secretary and Minister for Health in 1921 despite not being an MLA, and then served in the positions again from 1922 until his departure from politics in 1925. Oakes died in 1928.

List of Christian monasteries in Saxony-Anhalt

This is a list of Christian monasteries, both men's and women's, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Some were dissolved during the Reformation in the mid-16th century, but a number survived as Catholic institutions until the secularisation of the Napoleonic period, while others became Lutheran and continued either as schools or as establishments for the unmarried daughters and widows of the aristocracy ("Damenstifte"). The Communist period after World War II saw little activity in terms of religious houses, for obvious reasons: a conspicuous exception was the re-foundation of Huysburg Priory in 1972. A small number of religious communities, both Catholic and Lutheran, have opened after reunification. Extant religious houses are shown in bold.

Mervyn "Spam" Spence is a Northern Irish bassist, best known for his work with Wishbone Ash and Trapeze.
Musical career.
Spence moved to Staffordshire from Ireland in the late 1970s, and began playing with bands such as "The Jury" and "Big Daisy".
Trapeze.
During Spence's time in local bands, he was spotted by Mel Galley, who promptly offered Spence the bassist and vocalist position in Trapeze, which had been left vacant since Peter Goalby had left to join Uriah Heep. Spence briefly toured with the band, and during his tenure recorded one album's worth of material, which – due to Galley's departure to replace Bernie Marsden in Whitesnake – remains unreleased. Several of the songs from these sessions however (Demos exist in bootleg form), would form the basis for Galley's Phenomena project.
Wishbone Ash.
Following the break-up of Trapeze, Spence was offered an audition for Wishbone Ash while he was pitching demo material to various outlets. On the strength of his vocal range and enthusiasm, Spence became a member of the band. Spence would perform on one album by the band, 1985's "Raw to the Bone".
Post-Wishbone Ash.
Spence left Wishbone Ash in 1986 "to pursue family matters". He has since released two solo albums under the name "O'Ryan" (his mother's maiden name), 1993's "Something Strong" and 1995's "Initiate".

List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments on the Westside

This is a List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments on the Westside. In total, there are more than 85 Historic-Cultural Monuments (HCM) on the Westside, and a handful of additional sites that have been recognized by the Cultural Heritage Commission for having been designated as California Historical Landmarks or having been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Overview of the Westside's Historic-Cultural Monuments.
As a more recently developed section of the city, the Westside initially lagged behind other parts of the city in the designation of HCMs. In the first 20 years of the Cultural Heritage Commission's existence (August 1962 - August 1982), only three buildings (and three trees or groups of trees) on the Westside were designated as Historic-Cultural Monuments. The three buildings so designated are: (1) Rocha House -- (2) Hangar No. 1 -- the first building constructed at the airfield that later became LAX; and (3) the Ivy Park Substation, an electric generating station for the Pacific Electric Railway located on Venice Boulevard in Palms. Although the city's Westside became a center of wealth and architectural innovation in the mid-20th century, it was not until the 1980s that large numbers of buildings on the Westside began to be recognized as Historic-Cultural Monuments.
Non-HCM sites also recognized.
The LA HCM sites listed above include many of the most important historic sites in the westside area. Some others within L.A. in the area have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places or designated as California Historical Landmarks. These are:

Sir Abu Nu’ayr (, also romanized as Sir Abu Neir, Sir Bu Nair, or Sir Bu Nuair) is an island in the Persian Gulf. Lying off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, roughly north of Abu Dhabi city, and west of Dubai, it belongs to the Emirate of Sharjah.
Sir Abu Nu’ayr is almost perfectly round with a diameter of four kilometers, and a one kilometer long extension at its southeast end, making the shape of the whole island appear as a drop.
Sir Abu Nu’ayr is a salt-piercement structure formed by the movement of Cambrian (Hormuz) salt. Salt deposited of Cambrian age has moved progressively upward, puncturing through the younger overlying strata to create a salt dome structure. Surface expressions are composed of evaporites rocks, plus igneous rocks and quartzitic sandstone.
Sharjah has a small harbor and an airfield both located at the island's southeast end.
Crescent Petroleum, is the concession holder of the Sir Abu Nu’ayr area. The acreage is flanked to the NNE by Dubai's Fateh Oil Field complex, to the north by the Sirri Island oil field of Iran and to the west by the prolific oil and gas fields of Abu Dhabi.
The island, an environmentally protected area under the Sharjah Environment and Protected Areas Authority (EPAA), has been registered on the list of wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, and was in 2012 listed as a potential UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Anaerobic corrosion

Hydrogen corrosion is a form of metal corrosion occurring in the presence of anoxic water. Hydrogen corrosion involves a redox reaction that reduces hydrogen ions, forming molecular hydrogen. 
Metals enter aqueous solution and are oxidized.
"Oxidation reaction (pH independent):"
"Reduction reaction in acid solution:"
In an acidic solution, the water molecules are protonated and the hydronium ions (H3O+) are directly reduced into H2.
"Reduction reaction in neutral or slightly alkaline solution:"
In a neutral or slightly alkaline solution, the protons of water are reduced into molecular hydrogen giving rise to the production of hydroxide ions responsible of the precipitation of the slightly soluble ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2).
This finally leads to the global reaction of the anaerobic corrosion of iron in water:
Transformation of ferrous hydroxide into magnetite.
Under anaerobic conditions, the ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2 ) can be oxidized by the protons of water to form magnetite and molecular hydrogen.
This process is described by the Schikorr reaction:
The well crystallized magnetite (Fe3O4) is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2 ).
This process also occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of iron and steel in oxygen-free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table.

Franco Zuculini (born 5 September 1990) is an Argentine footballer who currently plays for Arsenal de Sarandí as a defensive midfielder. 
Club career.
Racing Club.
Born in La Rioja, Zuculini made his professional debut with Racing Club de Avellaneda on 13 April 2008 at not yet 18, starting in a 1–0 home win against Arsenal de Sarandí for the Primera División championship. 
He appeared in 29 league games and scored two goals in his first full season, helping his team narrowly avoid relegation.
Hoffenheim.
On 26 June 2009, Zuculini signed with TSG 1899 Hoffenheim in Germany. He appeared in only seven Bundesliga games during his short spell, scoring on 24 October in a 3–0 home win against 1. FC Nuremberg after coming on as a second half substitute.
Subsequently Zuculini began a series of loans, which saw him appear for Genoa C.F.C. in Italy, former club Racing and Spain's Real Zaragoza.
Real Zaragoza.
On 12 August 2011 Zaragoza announced the signing of Zuculini on a season-long loan, with a view to a permanent transfer later in the year. He made his La Liga debut sixteen days later, starting and featuring 52 minutes in a 0–6 home loss to Real Madrid.
Zuculini agreed to a three-year deal with the Aragonese in the subsequent off-season, He netted his first goal (two in all competitions) for the side on 10 December 2012 in a 2–0 success at Rayo Vallecano, being released at the end of the campaign after it ended in relegation.
Arsenal de Sarandí.
During the 2012-13 season with Zaragoza, Zuculini was hampered with a knee ligament injury in which he saw limited playing time. He focused rehabilitation efforts since parting ways with the Spanish team. While recovering from the operation, Arsenal de Sarandí allowed him to get into exercise programs and train along with the team players. In January 2014, after a nearly one-year period of inactivity, he returned to football when he signed a half-year deal with Arsenal. 
International career.
In January 2009, Zuculini was selected for the Argentina under-20 team for the 2009 South American Youth Championship in Venezuela. He was named by full side manager Diego Maradona in a squad of 14 local players in late May of that year, and made his debut on the 20th – aged just 18 – in a friendly with Panama (2–0 win in Santa Fe).

Bean was second mate on the "Churchill" sloop from 1751 to 1753. Part of Churchill's mandate was to explore the coast during her summer trading voyage north among the Eskimos. No serious attempt was made to accomplish this during these three voyages.
After these years, Bean was made master of the sloop and in 1755 and 1756 explored extensively during the summer season. His detailed journals tell of his exploration of the dangerous coast and reveal a resourceful and courageous man.

The street extends from Masaryk Square in the north to Magen David Square in the south, where it meets with Allenby Street, the Carmel Market, Nahalat Binyamin Street, and Simta Plonit. The street is named for King George V of the United Kingdom who reigned during the British Mandate.
At the beginning of the 1920s, the street was called "Carmel Street." In 1935, it was changed to its current name to mark the occasion of the king's Silver Jubilee. The western section of the street is still called "Carmel Street", which is where the Carmel Market is located. 
The street is a bustling commercial centre with many stores, restaurants and coffee shops. It is adjacent to the Carmel Market, as well as Dizengoff Center mall on Dizengoff Street.

During the 1970s, he was charged with five murders and several attempted murders, but never imprisoned on grounds of insanity: he suffered from schizophrenia, blaming the Devil for his actions. Instead, he was institutionalised in the Ştei psychiatric facility in 1976, following a three-year-long forensic investigation during which four thousand people were questioned. 
Urban myths brought the number of victims up to two hundred women, though the actual number was much smaller. This confusion is probably explained by the lack of attention this case received, despite its magnitude, in the Communist press of the time.

Georgia (U.S. state) wiretapping laws

Georgia wiretapping laws are regulated under O.C.G.A. § 16-11-62, § 16-11-64, and § 16-11-66. The law divides wiretapping into two categories, recording conversations (audio) and recording actions (photos and videos).
Conversations in private places are banned from third party audio recording and a member of a conversation can covertly record the conversation without the consent of others. Conversations that occur in public can be recorded by a third party (see O.C.G.A. § 16-11-62).
Recording actions in public places without the consent of those being recorded is legal. Recording actions in a private place or in a public place that is out of public view requires the consent of all those being recorded (see O.C.G.A. § 16-11-62). The law has further clauses regarding recording actions of individuals under 18 as well as when it is on one's own property.
Examples.
A person can "tap" his or her own phone and record the conversation without the permission of the person to whom they are talking. That is because the person is consenting to the recording and they are actively involved in the conversation being recorded.
A person may have a small tape recorder with a microphone (like a lapel mike) attached somewhere on their person whether visible or not. It is legal to record a conversation they have without the other party's consent. This is because the recorder is consenting to the recording and Georgia state recording law is a one party consent rule.

Keanan Duffty

Keanan Duffty (born 28 April 1964) is a British fashion designer and musician based in New York City. Duffty studied fashion design at Saint Martin's School of Art in London, and graduated with a first class degree. He is a member of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
Early years.
Duffty has always believed that music and fashion go hand in hand. He was a founding member of the British Punk band Sordid Details along with Martin Beard (Drums), Jonathan Cameron (vocals) and Dave Huzzard (Bass). Formed in 1978 (when Keanan was 14 years old), Sordid Details built a strong reputation in the North of England and were heavily influenced by the Sex Pistols, for whom Duffty would later design stage clothes.
In 1980, Duffty formed Wonder Stories, a New Romantic group influenced by David Bowie and Roxy Music. Wonder Stories gained support from Radio 1 DJ Peter Powell and good reviews in the 'Sounds' music paper. Wonder Stories played a number of gigs during 1980 and 1981, but by 1982 Duffty had chosen to study fashion design at St Martin's School Of Art in London. Keanan also worked at PX, the signature New Romantic boutique in London and former haunt of Visage vocalist Steve Strange.
By 1983, Duffty was discovered by an experienced music business manager, Falcon Stuart, former manager of Adam and the Ants, X Ray Spex and Classix Nouveau. Stuart encouraged Duffty to record demos for EMI and MCA records eventually releasing a 12" dance mix of "Water Sport" on Falcon Stuart's "Awesome" Records label (AOR4). Duffty also recorded a 4 song session at Maida Vale Studios for BBC Radio 1 DJ Janice Long. "Water Sport" received great reviews, including record of the week in Smash Hits, good reviews in the NME and became an underground club hit in the UK. Duffty played a number of shows in London including the ID Magazine Fifth anniversary party at the ICA. Both his music and fashion designs received positive reviews in the British music and style press.
Duffty relocated to New York in 1993 where he recorded the song "I Am an Alien". The Video featured famed downtown diva Amanda Lepore as a futuristic nurse and has become a cult classic on YouTube.
Fashion.
Keanan Duffty established his eponymous fashion label in 1999. The collection is inspired by subversive subcultures and mixes high fashion with youth culture, music and British iconography. Over 70 premium specialty retailers carry the collection including Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdales, Lounge in New York, Maxfield, Theodore, H Lorenzo and Fred Segal in LA, Lane Crawford and Joyce in Hong Kong, Harvey Nichols in London, and Beams and Journal Standard in Japan.
Keanan Duffty's clothes have a celebrity following that includes David Bowie, The Sex Pistols, Aerosmith, The New York Dolls, Mick Jagger, Iggy Pop, Bow Wow Wow, The Offspring, Stray Cats, Elizabeth Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Steven Dorff, Jimmy Fallon, The Smashing Pumpkins, Ashlee Simpson, Alyssa Milano, Kevin Dillon, Sarah Jessica Parker, and N'Sync. He once designed a space suit for Martha Stewart.
In 2007, Duffty drew inspiration from rock legend David Bowie to create a limited-edition men's collection for Target stores nationwide.
Duffty's clothes have been featured on prominent TV shows including "American Idol", "Entourage", "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy", "" and several music videos. Duffty also designs the clothes for his rock band Slinky Vagabond.
In 2010, Duffty announced the return of his signature label, reentering the market with a contemporary men's collection for spring. The collection will launch with 50 pieces, including woven shirts, knits, outerwear, skinny jeans, vests, trenchcoats and band jackets. On September 10, Duffty staged a "guerilla-style" fashion show in New York City. The models arrived by bus and marched around Lincoln Center with protest signs displaying lyrics from 80's pop songs by Kraftwerk and Adam Ant.
Music.
Keanan Duffty is lead singer in the band Slinky Vagabond, alongside Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols, Clem Burke of Blondie, and Earl Slick (David Bowie's guitarist). Slinky Vagabond made their debut in May 2007 at Irving Plaza as part of Joey Ramone's annual birthday bash. Slinky Vagabond also performed for Gen Art during New York fashion week and at the Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. In 2008, XS games launched "Pop Star Guitar" for Wii and PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system. Songs include 'Glitterbug' from Slinky Vagabond, along with tracks by Fall Out Boy, Paramore and All-American Rejects.
Duffty also performed at the Marc Bolan 30th Anniversary show at the Delacorte Theatre in September 2007 alongside Patti Smith, Scissor Sisters, Moby, Lloyd Cole and the New York Dolls. On April 18, 2008 Keanan was part of an extraordinary concert line-up featuring performances by Clem Burke, Slash, Tom Morrello, Alan Vega, Ronnie Spector, Ian Hunter, Cheetah Chrome, Joan Jett, and Handsome Dick Manitoba. The worlds of music and fashion fused as John Varvatos celebrated the opening of his second boutique in New York City at 315 Bowery, a space that formerly housed the seminal underground music club CBGB's.
In May 2008, Duffty was a featured performer at the Loser's Lounge tribute to The Kinks at Joe's Public Theater in New York City with Earl Slick. Keanan regularly sings at downtown New York events such as 'Bowie Ball', held bi-annually at Don Hill's club in the Village.
In December 2012, Duffty released a new album titled Killers In Glitter. The album is a compilation of Duffty's music, from his 1985 Water Sport release to his work with Slinky Vagabond in 2007. Many of the songs were written or co-written by Duffty with the exceptions of two covers: the David Bowie classic Boys Keep Swining and the Bauhaus (band) goth anthem Bela Lugosi's Dead.
Television.
Duffty's television credits include serving as host since 2008 on Emmy award winning Plum TV’s show 'The Juice', where he has interviewed many cultural icons - from Gore Vidal to Donna Karan, Tommy Hilfiger, Elvis Costello, Russell Simmons, punk impresario Malcolm McLaren, and actors Laura Dern, Courteney Cox, Alec Baldwin and Chase Crawford of Gossip Girl. Duffty has appeared as a mentor on TLC’s Faking It, and has been featured extensively on MTV, Videofashion, E! Entertainment, Sirius XM Radio and BLUE GOLD, a new documentary on the iconic blue jean.
"Rebel Rebel-Anti Style".
In 2009, Duffty wrote (with Paul Gorman) "Rebel Rebel-Anti Style". Tracing the roots of rebel style to the music scene, the book explores how fashionable music and "anti-fashion" icons, like David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, and Gwen Stefani, have inspired fashion. The book was published by Rizzoli (US) and Adelita (UK).
Duffty has given a series of "Rebel Rebel-Anti Style" lectures at fashion schools, including the Fashion Institute of Technology, Parsons The New School in New York City, Marist College, the Academy of Art San Francisco, LIM College, the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, and the Brooklyn Museum.
Velvet Revolver.
In 2008, Duffty received two instrumental tracks from Sanctuary Management, the representatives of Velvet Revolver. The 2 demo tracks were titled 'Muthafucka' and 'Clappy'. Duffty's challenge was to write and record vocals and lyrics for these songs. Duffty went into Club House studios in Upstate New York with Earl Slick as producer. The resulting session produced new versions of the Velvet Revolver instrumentals now entitled 'Fear No Evil' and 'Prima Donna'.
Malcolm McLaren Documentary.
“Malcolm McLaren: Spectacular Failure” is a documentary film currently under development. Producers Keanan Duffty and Daniel Honan captured the last interview with this icon of fashion, punk and rebellion in 2008 in Long Island, New York. McLaren talked extensively about the Sex Pistols and how important it was for the band to 'fail magnificently'. He also gave insights into his work on the 'Duck Rock'
album and his many projects over the years, including his design partnership and personal life with Vivienne Westwood, his 430 King's
Road boutique, and most recent art film based on the 1994 'Paris' album.

Virtual Collaborative Learning

Similar to computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), virtual collaborative learning environments aim to produce technology-based learning processes where participants can work together as a group to construct and share knowledge . Such environments “provide a rich opportunity for collaborative knowledge building, particularly through peer-to-peer dialogue.
In context of virtual collaborative learning, virtual structures and spaces are designed for individual and collaborative learning activities .
Virtual collaborative learning in terms of problem-oriented project work in groups facilitated is becoming increasingly common in distributed learning settings where participants are physically in different locations.
The basic affordances of virtual collaborative learning are to have the ability to synchronously and asynchronously communicate via an array of electronic tools, e.g.: group and discussion chats, wikis, and blogs, where application transparency is essential. The main barrier to virtual collaborative learning is the difficulty in achieving agreement when diverse viewpoints, cultural boundaries, acuity of thoughts, or different working and cognitive learning styles exist.
Virtual collaborative learning systems can be divided into two main categories: action-oriented from where the participant’s knowledge is captured and shared or text-oriented which focuses on participants sharing knowledge via written communication. Within these categories, the participants may
use a range of tools for both synchronous (e.g. chat, telephone conference, video conference) and asynchronous (e.g. threaded forum, document pool, e-mail)
communication.
The evolution of virtual collaborative learning systems will depend upon the participant's cognitive processes. The participant may adapt to the technology to change the way that they learn or the participant may utilize their learning and collaborative situation to optimize use the technology.

Siroka Melniska

Shiroka Melnishka, (), often called Melnik ("Мелник", not to be confused with other varieties named after the town) or Broadleafed Melnik, is a red Bulgarian wine grape variety. It is planted primarily near the Greek border. In Bulgarian the grape's name means ""broad-leaved vine of Melnik"". As a varietal, Shiroka Melnishka has an affinity for oak which can produce pronounced tobacco notes. The wines are often compared to Châteauneuf-du-Pape with its similar profile of spice and power. The wine was a particular favourite of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Notable producers of wine from the variety are the Damianitza and Logodaj wineries.
Synonyms.
Other transliterations that have been attested include Chiroka Melmichka Losa, Chiroka Melnichka, Melnik, Shiroka Melnichka Loza, Shiroka Melnishka, and Shiroka Melnishka Loza.
Related Varieties.
The traditional Broadleafed Melnik grape ripens late, and is harvested as late as October. This makes fully ripened grapes difficult to achieve, as the climate in south-west Bulgaria is becoming cold and damp by this time. In the 20th century there have been number of experimental hybrids made of various varieties to try to develop them in a way more suitable for Bulgarian vineyards. In 1963 a mixture of pollen from Valdiguié, Durif, Jurançon and Cabernet Sauvignon was used to hybridise with the Broadleafed Melnik vine. The resultant variety was approved for use in 1977 but was not much taken up until the first professional fermentation of it in 1999 generated more interest. The variety is called under various synonyms: Melnik 55, or Early Melnik, or Ranna Melnishka Loza (). Genetic testing has now shown the pollen parent was in fact Valdiguié. The resultant wine is usually quite different from that made from Broadleafed Melnik, although some bottles confusingly still bear front labels calling the wine merely "Melnik".

Ronald Davis (physician)

Ronald Mark Davis (June 18, 1956 – November 6, 2008) was an American physician who specialized in preventive medicine and was a public health and anti-tobacco advocate. Davis served a one-year term as president of the American Medical Association from 2006 to June 2007.
Davis was born in Chicago on June 18, 1956, to George and Alice Komessar Davis. He earned his Bachelor of Science in zoology from the University of Michigan in 1978, received a Master of Arts in public policy from the University of Chicago in 1981 and was awarded an M.D. from the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine in 1983.
He served from 1987 to 1991 as the director of the Center for Disease Control's Office on Smoking and Health and was chief medical officer of the Michigan Department of Public Health from 1991 to 1995. He later served as the director of health promotion and disease prevention for the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.
He became the first resident ever named to board of the American Medical Association, serving from 1984 to 1987. He was elected to the AMA's board again in 2001 and re-elected in 2005. He served as AMA's 162nd president from June 2007 to June 2008. He was the first physician specializing in Preventive Medicine to be named President of the AMA.
After being diagnosed with the disease in February 2008, Davis used his role as the AMA's President to encourage doctors to increase awareness of pancreatic cancer, a disease that ultimately killed Davis and which kills 34,000 Americans each year. As President of the AMA, Davis played a major role in the apology issued for the AMA's longstanding policies that effectively excluded African-American physicians from joining the organization. The AMA required doctors to be members of local medical associations, many of which refused to admit black doctors. Davis noted "a feeling of profound regret and embarrassment for what has been uncovered. That is why we are issuing this apology, but also because we believe that by confronting our past we can build a better future." Dr. Davis was a long standing member of the American Association of Public Health Physicians, which collaborates with the National Medical Association on historic inequities and health disparities. Dr. Davis provided memorable keynote addresses, at the 2008 AMA meeting, and to the AAPHP on June 14, 2008.
Davis died at age 52 on November 6, 2008 in his home near East Lansing, Michigan. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer. Davis had married the former Nadine Messina in 1979 and was survived by her and their three sons.

<doc id="20144856" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20144856" title="Uva Rara">
Uva Rara

Uva Rara is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont and Lombardy wine regions of northern Italy. The grape is a permitted blending variety along with Nebbiolo in the "Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita" (DOCG) wines of Ghemme. In the "Denominazione di Origine Controllata" (DOC) wine region of Oltrepò Pavese the grape is often blended with Barbera and Croatina. While Uva Rara's name means "rare grape" in Italian, the variety is actually widely planted with 608 hectares (1,502 acres) of the vine recorded in Italy in 2000.
History and relationship to other grapes.
Uva Rara has a long history of being grown in the Piedmont and Lombardy region, particularly in the provinces of Alessandria, Asti, Biella, Novara, Torino, Vercelli and Pavia. Here the grape has been historically used as a blending grape, with Nebbiolo in Piedmont and with Barbera and Croatina in Lombardy.
Uva Rara is often confused with the Gattinara and Oltrepò Pavese grape Vespolina that is also known as "Uva Rara", which means "rare grape" in Italian. Around the communes of Novara, Pavia and Vercelli, Uva Rara is known as "Bonarda" which has led it to be confused with many of the other grape varieties known as Bonarda, particularly Bonarda Piemontese. However, despite the similarities of synonyms and use in many of the same wines, there is no known relationship between Uva Rara and these other grape varieties.
Viticulture.
Uva Rara is a mid to late-ripening grape variety. Among the viticultural hazards that the vine is most susceptible to includes the fungal infection of powdery mildew and millerandage which can lead to the malformation of grape berries if the weather is unfavorable during flowering.
Wine regions.
In 2000, there were 608 hectares (1,502 acres) of Uva Rara planted throughout Italy with the vast majority in the Piedmont and Lombardy regions. Here the grape is a permitted blending variety in several DOCs and can be made as a varietal in the Colline Novaresi DOC. In the Oltrepò Pavese and San Colombano al Lambro DOC, Uva Rara is usually blended with Croatina and Barbera while in the Boca, Fara and Sizzano DOCs, it plays a secondary role to Nebbiolo. It is also permitted in the DOCG wine of Ghemme where it plays a similar role in softening the Nebbiolo-based wines of the region.
Styles.
While Uva Rara is primarily a blending grape, adding softness and fruit to the wines, it can also be made in a varietal style. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, varietal styles of Uva Rara tend to be soft, medium bodied with a very perfumed bouquet but the potential to have a bitter finish.
Synonyms.
Over the years Uva Rara has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Balsamea, Balsamina, Balsamina nera, Bonarda, Bonarda di Cavaglia, Bonarda di Gattinara, Bonarda Novarese, Foglia Lucente, Martellana, Oriana, Orianella, Oriola, Raione, Rairon, Raplum, Raplun and Rara.

Vespolina

Vespolina is a red Italian wine grape variety that is planted in Piedmont around Gattinara. Ampelographer believe that the grape is most likely indigenous to this area of Piedmont and recent DNA profiling identified a parent-offspring relationship with Nebbiolo. Outside of Piedmont, it is found in the Lombardy region of Oltrepò Pavese where the grape is known as Ughetta. In Gattinara, Vespolina is sometimes blended with Nebbiolo and Bonarda Piemontese. Unlike the white Italian grape Vespaiolo, the root of the name Vespolina does not have a direct connection with "vespe" or wasp. However the true origins of the name are still unclear.
Synonyms.
The grape Vespolina is known under a variety of synonyms. These include Balsamina, Canneta, Croattina, Guzetta, Guzitta, Guzzetta, Inzaga, Inzagre, Massana, Nespolina, Nespolino, Novarina, Solenga, Ughetta, Ughetta di Caneto, Ughetta di Canetto, Ughetta di Canneto, Ughetta di Fassolo, Ughetta di Solenga, Uva Cinerina, Uva Rara, Uvetta, Uvetto, Vespolino, Visparola and Vispavola.

Lilacine Amazon

The Lilacine Amazon ("Amazona autumnalis lilacina"), also known as the Ecuadorian Red-lored Amazon, is an Amazon parrot native to Ecuador in South America. A subspecies of the Red-lored Amazon, the Lilacine Amazon is generally smaller than its fellow subspecies, with a black beak and more subdued coloring. Lilacine Amazons are said to make favorable companion parrots because of their gentle, affectionate nature and agreeable temperament.
Description.
The Lilacine Amazon is a small parrot, approximately 34 cm long when mature, with primarily green plumage. Like the Red-lored Amazon, it has red lores and yellow cheeks; its distinguishing features include a fully black beak, and lilac-tipped feathers on its crown.
Behavior.
The Lilacine Amazon is known for its gentle and timid nature. In the wild it avoids confrontation with intruders, opting to seek cover in nearby foliage until danger has passed. It usually spends time in small- to medium-sized groups, with which it roosts at night; many birds pair off monagamously within the larger group, and they are most frequently seen flying in pairs.
Diet.
The diet of the Lilacine Amazon consists primarily of fruits, nuts, berries, and seeds. Like most parrots, it possesses a powerful beak; its dexterous tongue also helps to break down and consume a diverse suite of foodstuffs.
Breeding.
Sexual maturity is reached at three or four years of age. Like most parrots, the Lilacine Amazon is a monogamous breeder and a cavity nester. The hen will lay two to four eggs in a tree cavity and incubate them for a period of three weeks; the young fledge about two months after hatching.
As with many other parrots, the male will keep the female and chicks nourished during their time in the nest by consuming additional food and regurgitating it for them.
Distribution and habitat.
The Lilacine Amazon is native to the tropical forests of western Ecuador north of the Gulf of Guayaquil, extending to Nariño in extreme south-western Colombia adjacent to the Ecuadorian border, where it intersects with the subspecies "A. a. salvini".
Aviculture.
Lilacine Amazons have become well regarded as companion parrots, intelligent with a personality often described as gentle, affectionate, and loyal. In captivity, they enjoy the company of people, and will often form a strong bond with their owner. They are not known as exceptional talkers, but most individuals are able to learn to mimic at least a few phrases.
The Lilacine Amazon has only recently become popular and common in the pet trade, formerly being quite rare. At least one captive breeding program has been established in Europe to increase the bird's numbers.

USS Wallacut (YTM-420)

USS "Wallacut" (YTB-420), later YTM-420, was a tug that served in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1947 and from 1950 to 1976.
Wallacut was laid down on 14 August 1944 by the United States Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland. She was launched on 28 October 1944, sponsored by Miss Sally Koshorek, and completed on 23 March 1945. She was delivered to the U.S. Navy and placed in service on 31 March 1945.
"Wallacut" departed Curtis Bay on 8 April 1945 and, after stops at Norfolk, Virginia, Charleston, South Carolina; Miami, Florida; Key West, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana, and Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone, reached Eniwetok on 21 July 1945. She remained there for two weeks, then moved on, via Guam and Saipan, to Okinawa, where she arrived on 3 September 1945, the day after Japan's formal surrender ceremony ended World War II. She served at Okinawa until June 1947 when she headed, via Guam and Kwajalein, to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she was placed out of service, in reserve, in August 1947.
"Wallacut" remained in reserve until American involvement in the Korean War increased the U.S. Navy's need for active ships. She returned to active service on 11 August 1950 and departed Pearl Harbor for the Far East on 3 October 1950. After stops at Kwajalein, Guam, and Sasebo, Japan, the tug reached Korean waters on 16 November 1950. She served at Hungnam in December 1950 during the evacuation of United Nations troops following the intervention of Chinese communist troops. At the completion of her part in that operation, she stopped over at Pusan briefly before returning to Sasebo on 27 December 1950.
Records of "Wallacut"s service after 1950 are almost nonexistent. She continued to be listed as an active unit of the United States First Fleet until 1960, when she was assigned to the Commander, Naval Forces, Far East. Within a year, she was reassigned simply to the United States Pacific Fleet, and her duty location or locations are unrecorded.
In February 1962, "Wallacut" was redesignated a medium harbor tug and reclassified YTM-420. As such, she continued to serve the Pacific Fleet until January 1973, when she was placed in reserve and berthed at Guam in the Mariana Islands. After three years of inactivity at Guam, she was struck from the Navy list in June 1976. She was sunk as a target on 1 September 1976.

EGanges

eGanges (electronic Glossed adversarial nested graphical expert system) is an expert system shell, mainly for the domains of law, quality control management, and education. It represents and processes systems of mixed hypothetical and categorical syllogisms, no matter how large and complex. The hypothetical premises or rule systems are represented in River graphics that are tributary structures like Ishikawa diagrams that may be nested to any depth required by the expertise.
Instructions on the user’s categorical premises are received as input when answers are given to questions in the communication system of the interface. Each antecedent and consequent in the rule system is represented as a node in the River graphic, and each node has a question with three alternative answers: positive, negative and uncertain. As answers are selected by the user, their node labels appear as feedback in the appropriate adversarial case window and the Current result is available in the Current result window if the Current result button is pressed.
The answers are alternate three values and there is a fourth value, unanswered, allowed in the combinatoric deductive processing, where the user does not select an answer. Thus the process simulates the application of a four value logic. Its heuristics incorporate expert priorities in conjunctions and disjunctions, in determining pro tem and Final consequents throughout a consultation.
Each node may also be glossed in different ways. A spectrum gloss is available to represent inductive instances that fall into the three categories of positive, negative and uncertain, as data to assist the selection of answers. Abductive glosses may take free form as text providing justification or reasons for a rule or part thereof. There may also be gloss links to other programs or websites that provide further understanding of the rule system and what input should be given by the user.
Dr Pamela N. Gray designed eGanges in 2002 as part of her doctoral work. Subsequently, the design was programmed by her son, Xenogene Gray, who is a computational physicist. The software was first presented at the JURIX Conference at Utrecht University in 2003. A small eGanges applet in the field of finance law can be trialled at:

The following is a list of notable Air Ambulances in the United States:
Incidents.
Air Methods had, after the 2006 Mercy Air helicopter accident, a total of 19 accidents leading to the deaths of 21 people nationwide according to the National Transportation Safety Board's records. Air Methods companies had three other fatal accidents, in a 10-year period. On September 7, 2002, three crew members died when a Mercy Air helicopter based in Nevada crashed in Nipton, California after the main rotor blades separated while maneuvering in flight after dark. In January 2005, an Air Methods helicopter crashed in Washington, D.C. with two dead and one injured, and another crashed in Mississippi killing one.
Craig Yale, the vice president of corporate development for Air Methods, stated in a news conference shortly after the accident that, "We fly over 100,000 hours a year, 85,000 missions a year, and in doing so have had very few fatal accidents over a 10-year period."
On June 29, 2008, a Bell 407 medical helicopter operated by Air Methods collided with another medical helicopter in Arizona, killing six of the seven aboard both aircraft. Another Air Methods helicopter crashed in May in Wisconsin soon after taking off; three people were killed in that accident: the pilot, flight doctor and flight nurse.
On September 28, 2008, at approximately 12:30am, Maryland State Police Trooper 2 (Eurocopter AS 365N1 Dauphin, N92MD) disappeared from radar and crashed with five people aboard in Walker Mill Regional Park in Prince George's County. There were four confirmed fatalities, which included Pilot Stephen Bunker, TFC Mickey Lippy, EMT Tonya Mallard (Waldorf Volunteer Fire Department), and one of the two patients on board. This resulted in the grounding of all aircraft, until the cause is determined, with allied agencies covering the state. This is the fourth fatal crash in the history of the MSP Aviation Division. The most recent crash prior to this occurred on January 19, 1986.

Capture of Vĩnh Long

The Capture of Vinh Long (Vietnamese: Vĩnh Long) on 22 March 1862 was the last major allied victory of the Cochinchina campaign (1858–62). This campaign, fought between the French and the Spanish on the one side and the Vietnamese on the other, began as a limited punitive expedition and ended as a French war of conquest. The war concluded with the establishment of the French colony of Cochinchina, a development that inaugurated nearly a century of French colonial dominance in Vietnam.
Background.
The Vinh Long campaign was undertaken by the French and Spanish as a reprisal for Vietnamese guerilla attacks in February and March 1862 on French troops and gunboats in the vicinity of My Tho. French marching columns were sniped at on the roads, and on 10 March a French gunboat (No. 25) carrying a company of soldiers blew up shortly after it left My Tho. Fifty-two men were killed or wounded in this incident, and a commission of enquiry found that the explosion was due to sabotage.
Convinced that the mandarins of the province of Vinh Long were behind these attacks, Admiral Louis-Adolphe Bonard, the French commander-in-chief, decided to capture the town of Vinh Long with a flotilla of despatch vessels and gunboats and a joint Franco-Spanish landing force. On 20 March 1862 he arrived before the fortress of Vinh Long with the dispatch vessels "Ondine" (his flagship) and "Shamrock", the gunboats "Dragonne" and "Fusée" and seven small gunboats. The landing force, embarked aboard the gunboats, numbered 700 French soldiers and 300 Spanish soldiers, under the orders of Lieutenant-Colonel Reboul of the marine infantry. On 20 March these troops, reinforced by the ships’ landing companies, were set ashore at Dinh Kao, to the southeast of the citadel.
The capture of Vinh Long.
The following account of the attack by Reboul's French and Spanish troops on Vinh Long was given by Colonel Thomazi, the historian of the French conquest of Indochina:
On 22 March they crossed two arroyos under fire and advanced into view of the enemy batteries, which had been fighting a violent artillery duel with the gunboats. During the night, after a seven-hour struggle, all the batteries were occupied, and on the following day we entered the citadel, where we found 68 cannon and considerable quantities of materiel.
Mopping-up operations.
The Vietnamese defenders of Vinh Long fell back to a fortified earthwork at My Cui, west of My Tho. Admiral Bonard sent two columns under the respective command of "capitaine de vaisseau" Desvaux and Colonel Carlos Palanca y Guttierez to capture My Cui. Desvaux's column, which consisted of two companies of Turcos and a detachment drawn from the garrison of Vinh Long, set off from Vinh Long and approached My Cui via Cai Lay.
Palanca y Guttierez's column, which consisted of 200 Spanish troops, a company of Turcos and a section of artillery, marched directly on My Cui from Vinh Long. The two columns attacked My Cui simultaneously and captured it. "Lieutenant de vaisseau" Vergnes, who was watching the arroyos around My Tho with a detachment of "fusiliers-marins", intercepted and inflicted a further defeat on the retreating Vietnamese. Vietnamese casualties were heavy, and the allies also captured a large number of weapons.
Aftermath.
Coming on the heels of earlier allied victories at My Tho (April 1861) and Bien Hoa (December 1861), the capture of Vinh Long disheartened the Court of Hue, and in April 1862 Tu Duc let it be known that he was willing to make peace.

South Florida Fair

The South Florida Fair is an annual fair held in West Palm Beach, Florida, every January or February. The fairgrounds site occupies and is located on the site of the former Palm Beach Speedway at the intersection of Southern Boulevard (US 98/SR 80) and Fairground Road. It is set up to make it adjacent to the Cruzan Amphitheatre. Nearly 500,000 people attended the South Florida Fair each year.
The fair features a midway of rides, games, and concessions, themed exhibition halls, an agricultural and livestock agriplex, and smaller exhibition areas. There is also Yesteryear Village, a history park on the northeastern corner of the property.
History.
The fair began as the Palm Beach County Fair in March 1912, the Great Depression caused the South Florida Fair to operate with only a midway before ceasing to operate at all in 1937 also due to the effects from the Great Depression. The attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 disrupted plans to restore the South Florida Fair in 1942. The fair resumed in 1946 at the Palm Beach International Airport, it was moved off of that site when the Airport began to operate during the Korean War. The Fair was moved to the Palm Beach Speedway from 1953-1955 and it was also incorporated in 1953. Again, the location was moved to the campus of Palm Beach Community College in 1956; the property was later given back to the college.
In 1957, the fair was moved from John Prince Memorial Park. Finally, in 1958, the Palm Beach Speedway was purchased and is still the current location of the fair. The fair was renamed to its present day name for the 1960 event.
Organization.
The South Florida Fair and Palm Beach County Expositions, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation organized and existing pursuant to Chapter 616 of the Florida Statutes. It has a Board of Trustees that consists of 17 people who are responsible for setting policy and seeing that management of the association is carried out under direction of an executive staff consisting of the President/CEO and currently two Vice Presidents. The Fair also has Directors who serve in an advisory capacity. There are currently 55 Directors. The Trustees and Directors are non-paid volunteers. The day-to-day operation is the responsibility of the President, Rick Vymlatil, who oversees a staff of over 45 full-time employees.
Economic impact.
According to a study released in 2000 by Economic Research Associates, Inc., the South Florida Fairgrounds generated a total economic impact of $149,924,000 in 1999. This was prior to the development of the Expo East Exhibit Hall, the enhancement of Yesteryear Village (including the new Bink Glisson and the Sally Bennett "Big Band Hall of Fame") and the aggressive marketing of the Americraft Expo Center exhibit floor space. In addition, the Cruzan Amphitheatre alone is estimated to generate an economic impact in excess of $20 million. But not only does the Fair generate a significant economic impact, it makes a substantial annual cash distribution to the youth of this area from its own resources. In the 2007/08 fiscal year, the South Florida Fair paid in excess of $200,000 in scholarship and 4-H premium awards, compensation to choruses and bands performing during the annual Fair, and contributions to Palm Beach County schools through its Partners-In-Education Advance Ticket program.
Fairgrounds.
Approximately comprise the real property commonly referred to as the "Fairgrounds". In 1957, Palm Beach County gave the Fair at its present site but later took back for the stockade. This contribution was made in consideration of the Fair agreeing to relocate from John Prince Park in order that the County could vie for a state university (PBCC). Generally, the Fairgrounds is segregated into several pods or tracts: the parking tracts, Yesteryear Village, the Cruzan Amphitheatre, and the exhibit buildings, including the Americraft Expo Center and the Agriplex. The space available on the Fairgrounds for trade shows and exhibits exceeds . During the annual South Florida Fair, the southern parking tract is utilized as the "midway" containing rides, shows, games, and concessions.
Events.
The main event on the Fairgrounds is the annual South Florida Fair, which occurs over a 17-day period, generally in the last two weeks of January each year. Over the past several years, the annual fair has incorporated a theme as a means of stimulating tourism as well as the educational and cultural interest of the residents of Palm Beach County. For instance, "Florida" was featured at the 1998 fair and "Alaska"; "Tales of the American West"; "New England"; "Hollywood"; "Having a Ball"; "Dreams, screams, thrills, chills"; "Party with the Animals"; and "A World of Fun" were showcased in previous fairs. One of the greatest aspects of the annual fair is its agricultural and livestock exhibits which clearly provide the greatest variety of such exhibits anywhere within Palm Beach County. Even though agriculture is such a tremendous part of Palm Beach County’s economic base, many school children have never been exposed to it. However, at the annual South Florida Fair, not only can they see and learn all about agriculture, but can even witness a calf being born, or learn how a dairy is operated. The annual fair attracts nearly 500,000 people through its turnstiles. However, 650,000 people will attend various events on the Fairgrounds on an annual basis. Besides the . Americraft (now South Florida Fair) Expo Center, there are 10 other smaller exhibit buildings along with the Cruzan Amphitheater, Agriplex,Palm Beach Model Railroaders and Yesteryear Village. These events constitute 250 event days.
Yesteryear Village.
Yesteryear Village is a history park on , showcasing buildings and artifacts from the 1850s to the 1950s. It exhibits a large collection of early, original, and replicated buildings, including an old school, a farm, a blacksmith shop, a general store, a church, a fire department, a post office, a bait & tackle shop, and the famed Riddle House. Included is the only big band museum in the United States, the Sally Bennett Big Band Hall of Fame Museum. Guided tours are available.

Sam Cooper Boulevard

Sam Cooper Boulevard is an urban freeway in Memphis, Tennessee, U.S.A.. The more recent western segment of the road follows a parkway design, the older eastern portion which was proposed and constructed as a segment of Interstate 40 (I-40) is built as an expressway, without at-grade intersections and traffic lights. The western terminus of Sam Cooper Boulevard is at East Parkway North. At the western termination point of the road there is a short concurrency of East Parkway North with U.S. Route 70, U.S. Route 79. From its western end, Sam Cooper Boulevard continues east for to reach its eastern terminus at the Interstate 40/Interstate 240 interchange.
The road was originally planned in the 1950s. It was proposed as a segment of I-40 that would intersect the center of Memphis and continue west to Arkansas. The proposed route would have cut through Overton Park, an old forest public park in Memphis. Following a United States Supreme Court decision in 1971 the route was revised, I-40 was routed around Memphis in the north and plans of routing an Interstate highway through the city were abandoned. Ownership of the completed segments of the highway was transferred to the City of Memphis. As a road that is owned and maintained by the City of Memphis, no route number is assigned to Sam Cooper Boulevard.
History.
Proposed route.
In the 1950s, Interstate 240 (I-240) was planned as a complete loop around Memphis, consisting of a southern leg and a northern leg. Interstate 40 (I-40) was proposed to be routed through the center of the City of Memphis and to continue west into Arkansas over the Hernando de Soto Bridge, which was opened in 1973 and carries the traffic on modern I-40 over the Mississippi River. The I-240 loop was planned to route traffic not destined for Memphis around the city and to improve the flow of increasing traffic. The proposed I-240 loop would connect westbound and eastbound traffic to I-40 and southbound and northbound traffic to Interstate 55 (I-55).
What is now known as Sam Cooper Boulevard was planned as an extension of I-40, intersecting Memphis and distributing eastbound and westbound traffic with a destination in Memphis within the city. After a U.S. Supreme Court ruling stopped the plans to complete the section of I-40 cutting through Memphis in 1971, I-40 was re-routed. The routing of modern I-40 coincides with the proposed routing of the northern leg of I-240. Instead of the proposed I-240 loop around Memphis, the modern routing designates I-240 as the southern leg of the loop and I-40 as the northern leg of the loop.
From the west to the east, the proposed routing of Sam Cooper Boulevard coincides with the route of modern I-40 from the Hernando de Soto Bridge in downtown Memphis to the modern I-40/I-240 interchange west of North Bellevue Boulevard in midtown Memphis. East of the I-40/I-240 interchange, the proposed route of Sam Cooper Boulevard would have been routed almost due east for circa , parallel to and south of Overton Avenue and north of Peach Avenue until it reached Evergreen Street. From there, it would have continued northeast for about to reach the intersection of Galloway Avenue and North Mc Lean Boulevard. From there, the route would have continued roughly to the east, parallel to and about south of North Parkway, just south of the Memphis Zoo and cutting through the northern portion of Overton Park, to connect to the western terminus of modern Sam Cooper Boulevard at East Parkway North. At the western terminus of Sam Cooper Boulevard there is a concurrency of East Parkway North with U.S. Route 70, U.S. Route 79 for south of Summer Avenue and north of Union Avenue. East Parkway North also concurs with Tennessee State Route 277.
Namesake.
In 1968, the road was named after Sam Cooper, a Memphis businessman and longtime president of the Humko Corporation, a refinery of vegetable oils. He also was the vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Memphis. Cooper used his wealth to support St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Medical School.
Citizen protests.
In 1971, a United States Supreme Court ruling stopped an extension of I-40 through Overton Park. Sam Cooper Boulevard was originally planned as an extension of I-40 to intersect the City of Memphis. The proposed route was completed as proposed east of North Highland Street and west of I-240 in Berclair, in the northeastern quadrant of Memphis. The portion of Sam Cooper Boulevard west of North Highland Street was never built as planned.
The unbuilt portion west of East Parkway North was not completed because it was proposed to go through Overton Park, the Memphis Zoo, and several historic neighborhoods of Memphis. Citizens residing in the neighborhoods of midtown Memphis along the route of the proposed highway were able to stop the route cutting through the old forest of Overton Park in the lawsuit Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe.
Once the case was decided by the United States Supreme Court, the ownership of the completed segments of Sam Cooper Boulevard was given to the City of Memphis. Instead of following the planned route cutting through the center of Memphis, I-40 was routed around Memphis in the north. The new routing of I-40 to the north of Memphis follows the proposed northern leg of the I-240 loop.
Construction of the route segment of Sam Cooper Boulevard west of North Highland Street and east of East Parkway North began in 2001 and was completed in 2003. The construction did not follow the originally proposed expressway design for the road but implemented a parkway design with at-grade intersections, a raised median, traffic lights and sidewalks for pedestrians.
21st century.
Extension to East Parkway.
In 2001, the City of Memphis began construction on an extension of Sam Cooper Boulevard west of the North Highland Street exit. After completion of the first phase of construction, Sam Cooper Boulevard transitioned into Broad Avenue between North Holmes Street and Vandalia Street, about west of North Highland Street. The route coinciding with Broad Avenue had several intersections with traffic signals and two major railroad crossings, creating traffic congestion at peak times. The extension of Sam Cooper Boulevard was routed about south of Broad Avenue. Several of the intersections were eliminated, a viaduct was constructed to avoid the railroad crossings and the route was extended to East Parkway North.
The original route east of North Highland Street, was designed as a six-lane expressway without intersections, traffic signals and without sidewalks for pedestrians, allowing only motorized traffic on the road. The extension of Sam Cooper Boulevard west of the North Highland Street exit was constructed as a six-lane controlled-access parkway. Pedestrians are allowed on the route on sidewalks installed on both sides of the parkway west of Vandalia Street, located about west of North Highland Street. The median is raised and there are at-grade intersections present equipped with traffic signals and pedestrian crossings. The segment of Sam Cooper Boulevard west of North Highland Street and east of East Parkway North was completed in 2003.
Random shootings at cars.
In 2004, it was reported by local newsmedia that several cars driving on Sam Cooper Boulevard had been shot at randomly in the section west of Tillman Street and east of North Hollywood Street in the Binghampton neighborhood. The Memphis Police Department (MPD) reported 13 shootings between August and October of that year. A spokesman of the MPD stated that only vehicle damage had occurred and that no persons were hurt in the shootings. Police recovered a nine millimeter bullet from the front door of one vehicle. A special police task force was assigned to the case. It is not known if the shooter was caught.
Revitalization attempts.
In 2006, citizens from the Binghampton neighborhood of Memphis voiced concerns about negative effects that the completion of the western portion of Sam Cooper Boulevard has had on the community. Claims were made that construction of the road between North Highland Street and East Parkway North cut the Binghampton area in half by creating "high-speed traffic" and "confusing traffic patterns". It was mentioned that the routing of Sam Cooper Boulevard to the south of Broad Avenue had "effectively made" the circa long stretch of Broad Avenue a "ghost town", creating vacant lots in the partly industrial area and an unsafe neighborhood.
The Memphis Flyer cites Robert Montague, executive director of the Binghampton Development Corporation: "When they built Sam Cooper, this area really got buried". Citizens suggested changes in the zoning and a re-design of the Broad Avenue area north of Sam Cooper Boulevard and south of Summer Avenue to re-vitalize that part of the neighborhood and attract business and residents. The following year, trees and shrubs were planted alongside Sam Cooper Boulevard and in the median west of North Highland Street. A few decorative flowerbeds were also installed in the median of the road to enhance the parkway design of the road.
Exit list.
Proposed exits.
Sam Cooper Boulevard is owned and maintained by the City of Memphis. No route number is assigned to Sam Cooper Boulevard and it is not a designated business route for interstate traffic headed for Memphis. The exit numbering system on Sam Cooper Boulevard has not been changed since the route was planned. The exits are still numbered as if I-40 ran along Sam Cooper Boulevard as it was proposed to be built straight through Memphis to connect to Arkansas over the Hernando de Soto Bridge.
The exits for I-40 along the proposed route segment through the center of Memphis, west of East Parkway North, that was never completed were planned in downtown Memphis (planned as exit 1), at Danny Thomas Boulevard (planned as exit 2), west of North Bellevue Boulevard as an interchange with modern day I-240 (planned as exit 3) and at Stonewall Street in the Evergreen District of midtown Memphis (planned as exit 4). I-40 exits were proposed at East Parkway North (planned as exit 5) and Tillman Street (planned as exit 6).
The planned exit 1 along Sam Cooper Boulevard exists as exit 1 and exit 1A of modern day I-40 in downtown Memphis just south of the Pyramid Arena. Exit 1 serves traffic to and from North Riverside Drive and Front Street; at exit 1A westbound traffic exits to North 2nd Street and eastbound traffic enters I-40 from North 3rd Street. Planned exit 2 coincides with modern exits 1B–D on I-40 at Danny Thomas Boulevard. Planned exit 3 exists as exit 1E on modern I-40 at the I-40/I-240 interchange west of North Bellevue Boulevard in the Medical district of Memphis. Planned exit 4 at Stonewall Street was never constructed. Planned exit 5 is an at-grade intersection with traffic signals at the western terminus of Sam Cooper Boulevard at East Parkway North, and planned exit 6 is an at-grade intersection with traffic lights at Tillman Street. Exits 7–9 and Exits 10A and 10B were constructed as proposed.

<doc id="20145320" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20145320" title="Aeneator">
Aeneator

An aeneator () refers to a classical Roman professional performer of a horn who was attached to a Roman military unit. The word comes from Latin "aēneus" or "ahēneus", "brazen", from "aes", "copper alloy". 
Aeneators' role in war.
While the size of individual Roman military units, or Alae, may have varied, any Ala would made extensive use of both acoustical and visual signaling in communications and had an assigned banner bearer (Vexillarius) and at least one Aeneator. A variety of instruments were used by aeneators, including the buccina, cornu, tuba, and lituus. In addition to their roles within battle, aeneators would also be used for processionals and games, particularly in marching home from war
Different categories of aeneators.
Aeneators who blew a cornu (a G-shaped horn made of brass) were known as cornicines; those who blew a tuba (a straight bronze horn with a slight flare at the end) were known as tubicens; those who blew a buccina (a C-shaped horn made of bronze or silver or animal horn) were known as bucinators. Cornicens and tubicens mostly performed uncomplicated tactical signaling on the battlefield, and therefore were not accorded special status in the military unit. They had call duties in the barracks, just as other commonly conscripted soldiers had. By contrast, the bucinator was seen as a specially-skilled member of the unit who was capable of performing a wider repertoire and was used to perform a variety of ceremonial duties. Many units accorded bucinators immunis status, and there were equestrian bucinatores that served as cavalry buglers.
Other non-military uses for aerophones.
Aeneators were not the only skilled or specialized players of wind instruments in Ancient Roman culture. For other Roman aerophones and their usage outside of military contexts, see also:

The Polebridge Ranger Station in Glacier National Park was the first administrative area in the park, predating the park's establishment. The ranger station was destroyed by fire, leaving the residence.
The historic district originally comprised five cabins, a barn, oil house, a woodshed converted to a checking station, garage, generator house, fire cache, washhouse, and the Strissel Residence, moved to the site in 1975. Many of the other structures were moved to the site in 1955. The fire cache was built at the site in 1927, with a greater level of detailing than was usual in such structures. The 1927 log barn was a significant existing structure.
The only survivors of the 1988 Red Bench Fire were the checking station and the ranger station residence. The residence is a log structure, built in 1922.

The Drivetime

The Drivetime is a 1995 science fiction film directed, written and produced by the Finnish-born filmmaker Antero Alli.
Plot.
The film opens in the year 2023 in the Nostradamus Islands. A librarian named Flux recalls a series of earthquakes that destroyed the continental United States. A totalitarian government took control of the United States following the disaster, but video footage from the pre-earthquake world was lost. Flux is sent by the government back in time to Seattle, Washington, of 1999, to locate video footage of a riot that took place prior to the earthquake. He arrives in a society where telecommunications technology has replaced human interactions, and where police operations are presented as television entertainment. He also discovers the government is putting forth footage of non-existent riots as a means of establishing law and order.
Production.
"The Drivetime" was produced on a budget of US$5,000 (currently $). Rob Brezsny, author of the syndicated newspaper column "Real Astrology", wrote the text for the film’s psychedelic infomercials, while political writer Peter Lamborn Wilson, writing under the "nom de plume" Hakim Bey, also contributed to the screenplay.
Alli shot "The Drivetime" in five different video formats – BETA SP, HI-8, VHS, C-VHS, SVHS – and in Super 8 film. The riot footage was culled from the September 10, 1994, riots in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood that protested allegations of local police brutality.
Release.
"The Drivetime" was first screened at the Velvet Elvis Arts Theater in Seattle in August 1995. The film had a limited theatrical release and was later distributed on DVD.
"The Drivetime" received mixed reviews. Wired Magazine praised it as “one of the most chilling yet innovative cinematic essays on the flaws of today's technology-obsessed society” while Steven Seid of the Pacific Film Archive praised the film’s “provocative visuals” and noted it was best when plying its 'televisionary' speculations about a spiritual resurgence that will overwhelm virtuality."
However, Robert Firsching, writing for the Amazing World of Cult Movies, dismissed "The Drivetime" as a “silly mess” and called Alli “a ninny.” Alli, in an interview published by Film Threat, took umbrage with Firsching’s comments by stating: “Though I often remind myself that any review is only one person's opinion, harsh reviews always hurt. What are you going to do? Stop reading all your reviews? That's just more self-stabbing victim bullshit. Why not pick up some objectivity and identify the bias of the reviewer just to see where they are coming from? Just for fun. When I do this, it's understandable why The Amazing World of Cult Movies calls me a ‘ninny’ and my movie a ‘silly mess.’ That's very funny. If I were as cynical and jaded as them, I'd probably say the same thing.”

Administrative Department of Public Service (Colombia)

The Administrative Department of Public Service (, DAFP) is the Colombian executive administrative department in charge of formulating the general policies of public administration, especially in matters relating to civil service, management, internal control and streamlined procedures of the Executive Branch of Colombia.
In 1958, the Congress of Colombia passed "Law 19 of 1958", which created the Administrative Department of Civil Service ("Departamento Administrativo del Servicio Civil"), in an effort to give the public administration an agency in charge of managing the human resources of the State. On December 29, 1992 the Government issued "Decree 2169 of 1992", which dramatically changed the agency, changing its name to Administrative Department of Public Service, and putting it in charge of formulating policies and assessment material in management and human resources to the State.
The DAFP also operates the School of Public Service, ESAP, to educate and prepare the next generation of public servants of Colombia.

Thomas FitzSimons High School

Thomas Fitzsimons Junior High School, later The Young Men's Leadership School at Thomas E. FitzSimons High School, is a former public secondary school that, in its final years, was a secondary school for boys. It was located at 2601 Cumberland Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States and was a part of the School District of Philadelphia. The school was named after Thomas FitzSimons, who was a signer of the Constitution of the United States.
History.
The building was designed by noted architect Irwin T. Catharine and built in 1926. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 as the Thomas Fitzsimons Junior High School.
In September 2005, the School District of Philadelphia converted FitzSimons Middle School, a coeducational middle school managed by Victory Schools Inc. since 2002, into an all-male middle and high school. During that year the district established The Young Women’s Leadership School at E. Washington Rhodes High School for females. The males zoned to the former FitzSimons and Rhodes zones were assigned to FitzSimons, while the females in the zones were assigned to Rhodes. After the redesign FitzSimons reported increases on assaults targeting students and teachers. Margaret Harrington, the chief operating officer of Victory, described FitzSimons as having a "transition problem." Martha Woodall of the "Philadelphia Inquirer" stated in a 2006 article that the boys assigned to FitzSimons had tension with the boys assigned to Rhodes, and that tensions increased when they were combined into the same school. Richard H. Jenkins Sr., the principal of FitzSimons, said in that "Philadelphia Inquirer" article that he began establishing order with the students as the 2005-2006 school year progressed.
Victory Schools has been relieved of responsibility for the school; for the 2009-2010 school year, the school has been returned to the authority of Philadelphia Public Schools. At the end of the 2010-2011 school year, The School District of Philadelphia relieved Principal Darryl C. Overton of his duties as the school made its transition from The Young Mens Leadership School at Thomas FitzSimons High School to Thomas FitSimons High School- Promise Academy. In August 2011, budgetary issues and political unrest within The School District of Philadelphia negatively impacted the school's program direction and Thomas FitzSimons High School did not open as a Promise Academy. However, that school year, Thomas Fitzsimons High School operated as a comprehensive neighborhood high school adopting some of the reform measures associated with the Promise Academy model. The new school, led by Principal Jafar Barakat focused on re-shaping academic programing, highlighting gender based education, systems building to address school safety and climate as well as focusing on instructional rigor and parental partnerships. In the Spring of 2012, Thomas FitzSimons High School earned AYP or " Adequate Yearly Progress" in two educational categories, under the Safe Harbor designation, the first time ever in the history of school since the adoption and implementation of the NCLB legislation of 2000. 
As of Summer 2012 KIPP Du Bois Collegiate Academy, a charter high school that is part of the national KIPP network of charter schools, will be housed in the Fitzsimons Building.[http://thenotebook.org/blog/125009/two-charters-grow-seven-more-must-wait-learn-fate]
Transportation.
SEPTA serves the school with Routes 7, 33, 39, 48, and 54.
Feeder patterns.
Feeder elementary schools include Thomas M. Peirce Elementary School, Anna B. Pratt School, John G. Whittier School, and Richard R. Wright School. Ethel Allen School, feeds into FitzSimons.
School uniforms.
FitzSimons students were required to wear school uniforms.

Balut (game)

Balut is a game of dice, similar to Yahtzee. It was created by an American soldier named Edgar Woolbright stationed in the Philippines as an alternative to poker, and is a popular pastime of Danish businessmen overseas. The game is named after a delicacy made from the fetal duck egg available in some Southeast Asian countries.
The international Danish community has taken the game as a popular method of social interaction abroad and at home, with Danish expatriates/businessmen gathering to play the game monthly. Rules of the game, code of conduct including dress code are enforced by participants and by the gamemasters, and games are organized by members of the International Balut Federation, or IBF.
Play.
The game involves rolling five dice up to 3 times to make various combinations, which are noted on a scorecard. A Balut is a five-of-a-kind of any denomination, but unlike in Yahtzee it counts for little in terms of points. Players who obtain a Balut announce it to the other players by calling out "Balut!"—similar to calling out "bingo!", and note it on a special scorecard. Players try to guess before gameplay how many Baluts will be made during the game; correctly guessing the total number can earn a prize.
South East Asia variation.
There is also a different version of Balut played in Members’ Clubs in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines which follow a set of rules established in 1978 at Singapore Town Club. These Clubs organize regular local and international tournaments as well as gathering together each year for the STC Balut Interport Championship. The 28th was held at the British Club Bangkok in 2008 and the 29th was held at the Sabah Golf & Country Club in 2009. In 2010 the 30th STC Interport Competition will be held at the British Club Bangkok on 19 to 21 November.

Projected area is two-dimensional area measurement of a three-dimensional object by projecting its shape on to an arbitrary plane. This is often used in mechanical engineering related fields, specifically hardness testing, axial stress and terminal velocity.
The geometrical definition of a projected area is: "the rectilinear parallel projection of a surface of any shape onto a plane". This translates into the equation:
where A is the original area, and formula_2 is the angle between the normal to the surface A and the normal to the arbitrary plane onto which we project. For basic shapes the results are listed in the table below.

Pink International Company

Pink International Company (full legal name: "Preduzeće za informisanje i marketing Pink International Company d.o.o. Beograd") is a Serbian media company headquartered in Belgrade. Pink International is the main pillar of the Pink Media Group, the largest media conglomerate in the Balkans. The company is the owner of: Pink Television, known as TV Pink or RTV Pink (the leading commercial television station in Serbia); Radio Pink (a successful radio station covering Belgrade); Fashion TV Southeast Europe, Fashion TV SEE or FTV SEE (regional channel franchise from Fashion TV International); and, PFI Studios (international film production studios).
History.
Registered as a limited liability company, Pink International Company is owned by Serbian businessman and entrepreneur Željko Mitrović who amassed his fortune during the 1990s under the regime of Slobodan Milošević. Mitrović was a close personal friend of Milošević's wife Mira Marković and an influential official of her Yugoslav Left (JUL) party.
Mitrović originally founded Pink International Company in the 1990s following the formation of the radio activities and later expansion into television. The company was re-registered on April 25, 2005, in accordance with new Serbian laws and regulations.
In its 2007 annual financial report submitted to the Serbian Business Registry (a government agency), Pink International Company posted a profit of RSD325,780,000 (approximately €4.1 million) for the 2007 calendar year.
Activities.
Pink International's range of activities encompass:
Radio.
Radio Pink was started in 1993, covering only the Belgrade metropolitan area. The premise behind the radio was to focus on music programming. No news is broadcast.
Television.
TV Pink (or RTV Pink) is the leading commercial television station in Serbia. Founded in 1994 and covering initially only the Belgrade area, the station later achieved countrywide reach by the late 1990s. In 1998, TV Pink achieved the leading position in the market. TV Pink's emphasis is on light entertainment programming: movies, sitcoms, music variety shows, talk shows, reality shows and news.
Satellite Television.
Pink International provides production content for two global satellite channels (Pink Extra and Pink Plus) broadcast to subscribers in Europe, Australia and North America. There are nine direct-to-home (DTH) satellite channels that have been created in cooperation with Serbia's largest cable company, Serbia Broadband (SBB) although some content from Pink Extra and/or Pink Plus is available on the DTH channels. Pink International provides content for these satellite channels from its own production (TV Pink) and well as content purchased from or co-produced with independent production companies. Additionally, some content for the channels is also obtained from the sister television stations in Bosnia and Herzegovina (TV Pink BH) and Montenegro (TV Pink M).
Fashion TV Southeast Europe.
In November 2008, Pink International launched Fashion TV Southeast Europe (Fashion TV SEE or FTV SEE). Pink International obtained the franchise rights, from Fashion TV International, for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. This regional satellite channel is distributed through cable and DTH. Michel Adam Lisowski, the owner of Fashion TV International, attended the launch activities with senior Pink representatives including Zeljko Mitrovic in Belgrade, Ljubljana and Zagreb. Fashion TV SEE has a potential market reach of more than 20 million viewers.
Film Production.
PFI Studios (opened in 2007), a division of Pink International, consists currently of eight sound stages that have been designed and built to attract international productions, primarily American and West European. A ninth sound stage, planned for completion in 2011, will be one of the largest in Europe. In addition to the sound stages, the studio complex consists of administrative office buildings, warehouses and a back lot (12.5 hectares), all located in Šimanovci just 15 minutes outside of Belgrade. PFI Studios provides full production support in addition to studio infrastructure to international film projects. To date, productions such as "Lockout" and "The Raven" have been shot there.
PFI Studios has also co-produced Serbian films that have achieved local box office acclaim: "Promeni me" (Change Me), "Četvrti čovek" (The Fourth Man), "Čitulja za Eskobara" (Obituary for Escobar), and "Zona mrtvih" (Zone of the Dead).

The Hidden Prince of Oz

The Hidden Prince of Oz is a novel written by Gina Wickwar and illustrated by Anna-Maria Cool. As its title indicates, the book is an entrant into the series of Oz books by L. Frank Baum and his many successors. Fans have been reluctant to canonize it as book #46 because neither Wickwar nor Cool have any connection to the FF or QF7.
The publication of the book was timed to coincide with the centennial of the original Oz book, "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" (as was also true of Edward Einhorn's "Paradox in Oz" and Dave Hardenbrook's "The Unknown Witches of Oz"). It was the winner of the Club's Centennial book contest, which received over 100 entries in 1998.
Wickwar supplies her book with a range of puns, verbal tricks, and imaginative elements: Silica Valley and its inhabitants, plus the Magnetic Field, the Draw Bridge, a Babbling Brook and Caterwauling Cataracts, Snap Dragons, and Dragon Flies.
The plot.
Wickwar introduces a new child protagonist, Emma Lou, an orphan from Arizona, a tomboy and baseball pitcher. She is carried to Oz by the agency of Chief Thundercloud, an animated wooden Indian. There, Emma Lou falls in with a crowd of old and new Oz characters including the Glass Cat, Princess Vitrea, Ketzal (an animated feathered boa), and a blue parrot named Beak. (Indeed, Wickwar deliberately crowds her book with characters, in imitation of Baum's "The Lost Princess of Oz". Paddy, the rainbow-painting leprechaun in search of his lost pot of gold, is one of many.)
The characters have to confront the machinations of Zeebo the Sorcerer. With the aid of familiar figures like the Wizard, the Tin Woodman, the Sawhorse, and Polychrome the fairy, Emma Lou and her friends unravel the mystery of the missing Prince of the Blue Mountain, Vitrea's love.

Professor Robert Clancy

Professor Robert Llewellyn Clancy AM is a leading Australian clinical immunologist and a pioneer in the field of mucosal immunology. He is known for his research and development of therapies for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), commonly known as emphysema. 
Professor Clancy and his team's groundbreaking research into Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease concentrated on the link between the gut and the lung, and was able to provide evidence that the best way to create immunity against infection in the respiratory tract was to stimulate the gut immune system, whereby these activated cells migrate to the lung and make antibodies against organisms responsible for the infection.
Professor Clancy developed the vaccine Broncostat at the University of Newcastle in 1985. The Broncostat vaccine reduces attacks of acute bronchitis to a degree of 90%.
Professor Clancy is Emeritus Professor at the University of Newcastle's School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy. He was previously Foundation Chair of Pathology at the University of Newcastle and earlier in his career, was the first Clinical Immunologist at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney. Professor Clancy holds a B.Sc.Med (Hons)and a MB.BS (Hons) from the University of Sydney, and a PhD from Monash University. He is a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (FRACP) and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia (FRCPA).
Professor Clancy was awarded an AM (Order of Australia) in 2005 for service to cartography as a collector of early maps of Australia, and to the field of immunology.

Hudson Bay career.
Christie served a long career with the Hudson's Bay Company. His career gave him a special relationship with native populations in the territories. The Cree in particular consulted him about their concerns over the lack of Canadian government representatives and rumors of armed hostilities against the natives.
Christie was a Métis who spoke French and English and possibly Cree. In 1862 Father Émile Petitot met Christie at Portage La Loche. He quotes William Joseph Christie then the chief factor of Fort Edmonton as saying in perfect French "I am myself a Metis. By George! We are almost all Métis in the Company. Among the chief factors there is not a single Englishman, and maybe not ten Scots with pure blood."(translation) 
Politics.
Christie was appointed to the Temporary North-West Council, the first government for the Northwest Territories on December 28, 1872. His appointment was short lived as he resigned from the council less than a year later.
In May 1875 the Canadian Pacific Railway leased Christie's home in Selkirk, Manitoba to use as a telegraph office.
His grand daughter Edith Rogers served as a MLA in the Manitoba Legislature.

Cudgewa Football Netball Club

Cudgewa Football Netball Club, nicknamed the Blues, are an Australian rules football club that plays in the Upper Murray Football League. The club is based in Victorian town of Cudgewa and plays its home games at the Cudgewa Recreation Reserve. The club fields senior, reserve and junior sides as well as fielding all netball sides.
History.
The Blues were among the founding members in 1893 of the Corryong Football Association, the competition which, after several name changes, became the Upper Murray Football League in 1937. The side finished second in its debut season and again in 1895 before claiming its first premiership in 1896. This inaugural flag was won on the basis of the number of premiership points attained during the home and away season, but by the time Cudgewa next went top, in 1904, the Association had introduced a finals system. The Blues won that year's grand final against Corryong, and by the time of the outbreak of world war one had added further such triumphs at the expense of Federal in 1911, Corryong in 1913, and Federal in 1914.
Between the wars Cudgewa claimed another four premierships but it was during the first four decades after world war two that the club really came into its own. Over the course of the forty-one season period from 1946 to 1986 the Blues contested no fewer than twenty-four senior grade grand finals, winning sixteen of them.
The Modern Era.
Since the late 1990s Cudgewa has experienced mixed success under a variety of coaches starting by going back to back Premiers in 1999 and 2000. However by the early 2000s the Blues were struggling with the retirement of several older players and the reformation of the Bullioh Football Club the Blues were drained of many of its better players. For the rest of the decade the Blues made the finals on only 4 occasions as they slowly rebuilt with some of the more promising players in the competition. By 2011 under new coach Bill Deery, and with a host of new recruits, the club made a resurgence to reach the Grand Final only to be defeated by Bullioh by 63 points in the decider.

It was designed by Daniel Ray Hull of the National Park Service Office of Plans, as a frame building compatible in style with the prevailing National Park Service Rustic style. It is the center of a group of related buildings, including several residential structures.
East Glacier, Montana was an arrival point for tourists arriving by rail in the park. Until the 1920 completion of US 2 and the Going-to-the-Sun Road, the east side of the park was isolated from the headquarters at West Glacier. The new ranger station complex at East Glacier was proposed to provide administrative services to the east side. In 1937, with the completion of the Going-to-the-Sun Road the more convenient Saint Mary Ranger Station took over maintenance duties, and four buildings at East Glacier were demolished by Civilian Conservation Corps workers.

Decoherence-free subspaces

A decoherence-free subspace (DFS) is a subspace of a system's Hilbert space that is invariant to non-unitary dynamics. Alternatively stated, they are a small section of the system Hilbert space where the system is decoupled from the environment and thus its evolution is completely unitary. DFSs can also be characterized as a special class of quantum error correcting codes. In this representation they are "passive" error-preventing codes since these subspaces are encoded with information that (possibly) won't require any "active" stabilization methods. These subspaces prevent destructive environmental interactions by isolating quantum information. As such, they are an important subject in quantum computing, where (coherent) control of quantum systems is the desired goal. Decoherence creates problems in this regard by causing loss of coherence between the quantum states of a system and therefore the decay of their interference terms, thus leading to loss of information from the (open) quantum system to the surrounding environment. Since quantum computers cannot be isolated from their environment (i.e. we cannot have a truly isolated quantum system in the real world) and information can be lost, the study of DFSs is important for the implementation of quantum computers into the real world.
Background.
Origins.
The study of DFSs began with a search for structured methods to avoid decoherence in the subject of quantum information processing (QIP). The methods involved attempts to identify particular states which have the potential of being unchanged by certain decohering processes (i.e. certain interactions with the environment). These studies started with observations made by G.M. Palma, K-A Suominen, and A.K. Ekert, who studied the consequences of pure dephasing on two qubits that have the same interaction with the environment. They found that two such qubits do not decohere. Originally the term "sub-decoherence" was used by Palma to describe this situation. Noteworthy is also independent work by Martin Plenio, Vlatko Vedral and Peter Knight who constructed an error correcting code with codewords that are invariant under a particular unitary time evolution in spontaneous emission.
Further development.
Shortly afterwards, L-M Duan and G-C Guo also studied this phenomenon and reached the same conclusions as Palma, Suominen, and Ekert. However, Duan and Guo applied their own terminology, using "coherence preserving states" to describe states that do not decohere with dephasing. Duan and Guo furthered this idea of combining two qubits to preserve coherence against dephasing, to both collective dephasing and dissipation showing that decoherence is prevented in such a situation. This was shown by assuming knowledge of the system-environment coupling strength. However, such models were limited since they dealt with the decoherence processes of dephasing and dissipation solely. To deal with other types of decoherences, the previous models presented by Palma, Suominen, and Ekert, and Duan and Guo were cast into a more general setting by P. Zanardi and M. Rasetti. They expanded the existing mathematical framework to include more general system-environment interactions, such as collective decoherence-the same decoherence process acting on all the states of a quantum system and general Hamiltonians. Their analysis gave the first formal and general circumstances for the existence of decoherence-free (DF) states, which did not rely upon knowing the system-environment coupling strength. Zanardi and Rasetti called these DF states "error avoiding codes". Subsequently, Daniel A. Lidar proposed the title "decoherence-free subspace" for the space in which these DF states exist. Lidar studied the strength of DF states against perturbations and discovered that the coherence prevalent in DF states can be upset by evolution of the system Hamiltonian. This observation discerned another prerequisite for the possible use of DF states for quantum computation. A thoroughly general requirement for the existence of DF states was obtained by Lidar, D. Bacon, and K.B. Whaley expressed in terms of the Kraus operator-sum representation (OSR).
Recent research.
A subsequent development was made in generalizing the DFS picture when E. Knill, R. Laflamme, and L. Viola introduced the concept of a "noiseless subsystem". Knill extended to higher-dimensional irreducible representations of the algebra generating the dynamical symmetry in the system-environment interaction. Earlier work on DFSs described DF states as singlets, which are one-dimensional irreducible representations. This work proved to be successful, as a result of this analysis was the lowering of the number of qubits required to build a DFS under collective decoherence from four to three. The generalization from subspaces to subsystems formed a foundation for combining most known decoherence prevention and nulling strategies.
Conditions for the existence of decoherence-free subspaces.
Hamiltonian formulation.
Consider an N-dimensional quantum system S coupled to a bath B and described by the combined system-bath Hamiltonian as follows:
where the interaction Hamiltonian formula_2 is given in the usual way as
and where formula_4 act upon the system(bath) only, and formula_5 is the system(bath) Hamiltonian, and formula_6 is the identity operator acting on the system (bath).
Under these conditions, the dynamical evolution within formula_7, where formula_8 is the system Hilbert space, is completely unitary formula_9 (all possible bath states) if and only if:
(i) formula_10
formula_9 that span formula_12 and formula_13, the space of bounded system-bath operators on formula_14,
(ii) the system and bath are not coupled at first (i.e. they can be represented as a product state),
(iii) there is no "leakage" of states out of formula_12; that is, the system Hamiltonian formula_16 does not map the states formula_17 out of formula_12.
In other words, if the system begins in formula_12(i.e. the system and bath are initially decoupled) and the system Hamiltonian formula_16 leaves formula_21 invariant, then formula_12 is a DFS if and only if it satisfies (i).
These states are degenerate eigenkets of formula_23 and thus are distinguishable, hence preserving information in certain decohering processes. Any subspace of the system Hilbert space that satisfies the above conditions is a decoherence-free subspace. However, information can still "leak" out of this subspace if condition (iii) is not satisfied. Therefore, even if a DFS exists under the Hamiltonian conditions, there are still non-unitary actions that can act upon these subspaces and take states out of them into another subspace, which may or may not be a DFS, of the system Hilbert space.
Operator-sum representation formulation.
Let formula_24 be an N-dimensional DFS, where formula_8 is the system's (the quantum system alone) Hilbert space. The Kraus operators when written in terms of the N basis states that span formula_8 are given as:
where formula_28 (formula_29 is the combined system-bath Hamiltonian), formula_30 acts on formula_24, and formula_32 is an arbitrary matrix that acts on formula_33 (the orthogonal complement to formula_12). Since formula_32 operates on formula_33, then it will not create decoherence in formula_12; however, it can (possibly) create decohering effects in formula_33. Consider the basis kets formula_39 which span formula_12 and, furthermore, they fulfill:
formula_30 is an arbitrary unitary operator and may or may not be time-dependent, but it is independent of the indexing variable formula_43. The formula_44's are complex constants. Since formula_39 spans formula_12, then any pure state formula_47 can be written as a linear combination of these basis kets:
This state will be decoherence-free; this can be seen by considering the action of formula_32 on formula_50:
Therefore, in terms of the density operator representation of formula_50, formula_53, the evolution of this state is:
The above expression says that formula_55 is a pure state and that its evolution is unitary, since formula_30 is unitary. Therefore, "any" state in formula_12 will not decohere since its evolution is governed by a unitary operator and so its dynamical evolution will be completely unitary. Thus formula_12 is a decoherence-free subspace.
The above argument can be generalized to an initial arbitrary mixed state as well.
Semigroup formulation.
This formulation makes use of the semigroup approach. The Lindblad decohering term determines when the dynamics of a quantum system will be unitary; in particular, when formula_59, where formula_60 is the density operator representation of the state of the system, the dynamics will be decoherence-free.
Let formula_39 span formula_24, where formula_8 is the system's Hilbert space. Under the assumptions that:
a necessary and sufficient condition of for formula_12 to be a DFS is formula_65:
The above expression states that "all" basis states formula_67 are degenerate eigenstates of the error generators formula_68 As such, their respective coherence terms do not decohere. Thus states within formula_12 will remain mutually distinguishable after a decohering process since their respective eigenvalues are degenerate and hence identifiable after action under the error generators.
DFSs as a special class of information-preserving structures (IPS) and quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs).
Information-preserving structures (IPS).
DFSs can be thought of as "encoding" information through its set of states. To see this, consider a d-dimensional open quantum system that is prepared in the state formula_70-a non-negative (i.e. its eigenvalues are positive), trace-preserving formula_71, formula_72 density operator that belongs to the system's Hilbert-Schmidt space, the space of bounded operators on formula_73 formula_74. Suppose that this density operator(state) is selected from a set of states formula_75, a DFS of formula_8 (the system's Hilbert space) and where formula_77.
This set of states is called a "code", because the states within this set "encode" particular kind of information; that is, the set "S" encodes information through its states. This information that is contained within formula_78 must be able to be accessed; since the information is encoded in the states in formula_78, these states must be distinguishable to some process, formula_80 say, that attempts to acquire the information. Therefore, for two states formula_81, the process formula_80 is "information preserving" for these states if the states formula_83 remain "as" distinguishable after the process as they were before it. Stated in a more general manner, a code formula_78 (or DFS) is preserved by a process formula_80 iff each pair of states formula_86 is as distinguishable after formula_80 is applied as they were before it was applied. A more practical description would be: formula_78 is preserved by a process formula_80 if and only if formula_90 and formula_91
This just says that formula_80 is a 1:1 trace-distance-preserving map on formula_78. In this picture DFSs are sets of states (codes rather) whose "mutual distinguishability" is unaffected by a process formula_80.
Quantum error-correcting codes(QECCs).
Since DFSs can encode information through their sets of states, then they are secure against errors (decohering processes). In this way DFSs can be looked at as a special class of QECCs, where information is encoded into states which can be disturbed by an interaction with the environment but retrieved by some reversal process.
Consider a code formula_96, which is a subspace of the system Hilbert space, with encoded information given by formula_97 (i.e. the "codewords"). This code can be implemented to protect against decoherence and thus prevent loss of information in a small section of the system's Hilbert space. The errors are caused by interaction of the system with the environment (bath) and are represented by the Kraus operators. After the system has interacted with the bath, the information contained within formula_98 must be able to be "decoded"; therefore, to retrieve this information a recovery operator formula_99 is introduced. So a QECC is a subspace formula_98 along with a set of recovery operators formula_101
Let formula_98 be a QECC for the error operators represented by the Kraus operators formula_103, with recovery operators formula_101 Then formula_98 is a DFS if and only if upon restriction to formula_98, then formula_107, where formula_108 is the inverse of the system evolution operator.
In this picture of reversal of quantum operations, DFSs are a special instance of the more general QECCs whereupon restriction to a given a code, the recovery operators become proportional to the inverse of the system evolution operator, hence allowing for unitary evolution of the system.
Notice that the subtle difference between these two formulations exists in the two words "preserving" and "correcting"; in the former case, error-"prevention" is the method used whereas in the latter case it is error-"correction". Thus the two formulations differ in that one is a "passive" method and the other is an "active" method.
Example of a decoherence-free subspace.
Collective dephasing.
Consider a two-qubit Hilbert space, spanned by the basis qubits formula_109 which undergo collective dephasing. A random phase formula_110 will be created between these basis qubits; therefore, the qubits will transform in the following way:
Under this transformation the basis states formula_112 obtain the same phase factor formula_113. Thus in consideration of this, a state formula_50 can be encoded with this information (i.e. the phase factor) and thus evolve unitarily under this dephasing process, by defining the following encoded qubits:
Since these are basis qubits, then any state can be written as a linear combination of these states; therefore,
This state will evolve under the dephasing process as:
However, the "overall" phase for a quantum state is unobservable and, as such, is irrelevant in the description of the state. Therefore, formula_118 remains invariant under this dephasing process and hence the basis set formula_119 is a "decoherence-free subspace" of the 4-dimensional Hilbert space. Similarly, the subspaces formula_120 are also DFSs.
Alternative: decoherence-free subsystems.
Consider a quantum system with an N-dimensional system Hilbert space formula_121 that has a general subsystem decomposition formula_122 The subsystem formula_123 is a decoherence-free subsystem with respect to a system-environment coupling if every pure state in formula_123 remains unchanged with respect to this subsystem under the OSR evolution. This is true for any possible initial condition of the environment. To understand the difference between a decoherence-free "subspace" and a decoherence-free "subsystem", consider encoding a single qubit of information into a two-qubit system. This two-qubit system has a 4-dimensional Hilbert space; one method of encoding a single qubit into this space is by encoding information into a subspace that is spanned by two orthogonal qubits of the 4-dimensional Hilbert space. Suppose information is encoded in the orthogonal state formula_125 in the following way:
This shows that information has been encoded into a "subspace" of the two-qubit Hilbert space. Another way of encoding the same information is to encode "only" one of the qubits of the two qubits. Suppose the first qubit is encoded, then the state of the second qubit is completely arbitrary since:
This mapping is a "one-to-many" mapping from the one qubit encoding information to a two-qubit Hilbert space. Instead, if the mapping is to formula_50, then it is identical to a mapping from a qubit to a subspace of the two-qubit Hilbert space.

He returned to become a manufacturer of building supplies, and was a leader of the Riverina new state movement. In 1931, he was elected to the Australian Senate for New South Wales as a member of the Country Party, taking his seat in 1932. He was defeated in 1937, leaving the Senate in 1938. Having left politics, he became a co-ordinator of works with the RAAF. Hardy died in 1941.

Klippe (coin)

A klippe is a square coin minted on more easily produced square flans either using round or square dies. These coins were originally issued under unfavourable conditions, such as a city under siege. Such emergency coinage were issued in Vienna in 1529, while the city was besieged by the troops of the Ottoman Empire. However, by the seventeenth century, klippe were also commonly produced as presentation pieces.

Saint John Neumann High School (Pennsylvania)

Saint John Neumann High School was an all-male Roman Catholic high school located in the South Philadelphia area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. In 2004 the school, which was a part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, merged with Saint Maria Goretti High School to form Saints John Neumann and Maria Goretti Catholic High School.
History.
Southeast Catholic High School opened at the intersection of Seventh Street and Christian Street in 1934. The school became Bishop Neumann High School, after John Neumann, in 1955. In March of the following year the school moved to 2600 Moore Street, its last location. In August 1978 the school became St. John Neumann High School to reflect Neumann's canonization. In 1992 Neumann had 853 students. In October 1992 consultants told the archdiocese that Neumann and Goretti should be consolidated onto Neumann's site. By December of that year the archdiocese decided not to consolidate the two schools. In 2003 Neumann had 608 students. By then the combined populations of both schools declined by 29 percent in an 11 year span. In March 2003 the archdiocese asked the faculty and staff of Neumann to consider merging or closing the school as the school had increasing deficits and a decreasing student population. In June of that year the committees unanimously requested a merge. In September of that year Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the head of the Philadelphia Archdiocese, decided that the merge should occur.
The former Neumann campus became the St. John Neumann Place, a housing development for senior citizens.

<doc id="20146097" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20146097" title="Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat">
Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat

Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat (29 May 1773 – 18 February 1838), founded a neo-Templar imitation order called "l'Ordre du Temple" in 1804 and the Johannite Church in 1812, and proclaimed himself Grand Master of the Templars and Sovereign Pontiff of the Primitive Christian Catholic religion, opposing the Church of Saint Peter.
Early life.
Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat was the son of a surgeon and nephew of a priest in the diocese of Cahors. He studied at the diocesan seminary and was ordained a priest. Leaving the priesthood, he studied medicine in Montpellier and Caen, where he received his medical degree on 12 April 1798. Moving to Paris the same year, he obtained another medical degree on 16 September 1803, and became the director general of the "Société médico-philantropique". 
Order of the Temple.
On 4 November 1804 Fabré-Palaprat founded the Order of the Temple and revealed the existence of the Larmenius Charter (or "Charter of Transmission"). Knights of the Order were always addressed as "Sir Knights". The Grand Master of the Order was addressed as "Most Eminent Highness, Very Great, Powerful, and Excellent Prince, and Most Serene Lord."
The Larmenius Charter, allegedly written in Latin in 1324, listed 22 successive Grand Masters of the Knights Templar from 1324 to 1804, Fabré-Palaprat's name appearing last on the list. The Charter is named after Johannes Marcus Larmenius, who allegedly wrote the document and was allegedly appointed Grand Master by Jacques de Molay while imprisoned, also having the power to appoint his successor (Thomas Theobaldus Alexandrinus in 1324; the first name on the list). The list of Grand Masters in the Larmenius Charter differs from the list of 'Scottish' Grand Masters given by the German Strict Observance, and the Larmenius Charter also anathematized the 'Scottish' Templars, who were excommunicated by Johannes Marcus Larmenius in 1324, who declared them "Deserters of The Temple".
Fabré-Palaprat's Order of the Temple claimed to possess significant relics: the sword of Jacques de Molay, the helmet of Guy Dauphin d'Auvergne, the Beausant, and four fragments of burnt bones taken from the funeral pyre where Jacques de Molay had been executed. These relics, described as "The Sacred Treasure of The Order of The Temple" in the Manual of the order (and described within an Inventory in the Statutes of the order), were displayed in March 1808 on the anniversary of Jacques de Molay's death, when members of the Order celebrated a public requiem for the 'martyred' Grand Master in the Church of St. Paul in Paris.
Johannite Church.
In 1812 Fabré-Palaprat formed the Johannite Church, introducing faith-based elements into his order. He later ordained Ferdinand-François Châtel, a radical clergyman who left the priesthood following the July Revolution, as Primate of the Johannite church, on 4 May 1831. Châtel established his new French Catholic Church ("Eglise Catholique Française") in former shop premises in Montmartre, decorating it with the bust of Louis Philippe I placed under the Tricolour flag. The Johannite church was located in a former bottle shop in the "Cour des miracles", dubbed the "Apostolic Court of the Temple". The Order dated its documents from 'Magistropolis', a mystical calendar commencing from the foundation of the Knights Templar in 1118.
In 1831, following the July Revolution, Fabré-Palaprat published the "Evangelikon", a Gnostic version of the Gospel of John that omits intra-textual commentary and the Resurrection narrative, preceded by an introduction and a commentary allegedly written by Nicephorus, a Greek monk of Athens, that carries the name "Lévitikon". The "Lévitikon" contains an esoteric lineage from Jesus to the Knights Templar, and hints that Jesus was an initiate of the mysteries of Osiris, which were passed on to John the Beloved. Fabré-Palaprat claimed to have bought this vellum manuscript (allegedly dating from the 15th century), from a Paris second-hand bookstall on New Year's Day in 1814. It was translated into English for the first time in 2010. Neo-Templar orders that claim descent from the Larmenius Charter support the assertions of the "Lévitikon".
Fabré-Palaprat introduced a Johannite Mass in 1834. The title "Christ" was reserved not just for Jesus but used for all leaders of the Johannite tradition who had attained Gnosis.
In 1836 a schism, led by the Duc de Choiseul resulted out of dissatisfaction with the new Johannite church that had replaced the previous chivalric-style order. Fabré-Palaprat responded by admitting Sir Sidney Smith to the Johannite church.
The Duc de Choiseul was later elected Grand Master of the Order of the Temple in 1838, dying the same year.
Sir Sidney Smith was invited to take over as Grand Master of the Order, an offer he declined, but consented to preside over as Regent until a successor to Fabré-Palaprat had been chosen (which did not happen during his lifetime).
Distinctions.
Fabré-Palaprat was awarded the Legion of Honour for his defence of Paris in 1814, and received the July Medal for his actions during the Three Glorious Days of the Revolution of 1830. 
"Memoir of the Late M. Bernard Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, Grand Master of the Order of the Temple" was published by Robert Bigsby the Younger, in "The Miscellaneous Poems and Essays of Robert Bigsby" (London: Whittaker And Co., 1842).
Aftermath.
The Regency of the Order of the Temple was at one stage passed on to Joséphin Péladan, later becoming amalgamated among other occult groups headed by Papus, finally becoming legally incorporated by a Belgian group known as the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ), as well as the "Sovereign Order of the Initiatory Temple" (OSTI), and its outer order known as "International Circle for Cultural and Scientific Research" (CIRCES International), with CIRCES being created by Raymond Bernard in 1988. Raymond Bernard describes his initiation into the OSTI in 1955, and the mission he was charged with for bringing OSTI public, in his 1966 book entitled "A Secret Meeting In Rome". Raymond Bernard created CIRCES International as an outward Templar vehicle to eventually prepare people for initiation into the inner Order of the OSTI. CIRCES International also continues to protect and perpetuate "L'Ordre Martiniste" of Papus, which Joseph Péladan had been initiated into.

<doc id="20146126" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20146126" title="Commercial Paper Funding Facility">
Commercial Paper Funding Facility

Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) was a system created by the United States Federal Reserve Board during the Global financial crisis of 2008 to improve liquidity in the short-term funding markets. The CPFF was created on October 27, 2008 and funded a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that purchased three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper (CP) from eligible issuers. This resulted in greater availability of credit for firms doing business. It worked under the aegis of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York where the NY Fed finances the purchase of highly-rated unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper from eligible issuers via eligible primary dealers. The facility expired February 1, 2010. The final CP purchased matured on April 26, 2010. All CP notes purchased were repaid in full.
Explanation.
The CPFF began operations on October 27, 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and government bailout of AIG and the global credit freeze that ensued. The CPFF method of short-term funding provided liquidity to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle, aka SPV, which bought unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper for 3 month period from eligible issuers with funds made available by the NY Fed. The commercial paper remained in the custody of the SPV till the CP matured. On maturity, the proceeds from commercial paper and other assets were used to repay the loan that was originally taken from the NY Fed. All purchases of the Commercial Papers by the SPV was done through the New York Fed’s primary dealers. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. 45 out 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.
This program was created at the same time that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation implemented the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to increase liquidity in inter-bank lending.
Eligibility.
Only "Active" U.S. issuers of commercial paper (including those with a foreign parent), were eligible to sell commercial paper to the SPV. Active was defined as having at least three consecutive months of commercial paper outstanding during the period starting January 1, 2008 through August 31, 2008. 
The commercial paper had to be rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by a major nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) and, if rated by multiple major NRSROs, must have been rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by two or more major NRSROs. 
As part of the application process to be eligible for this program issuers had to pay a 10 basis point (0.1%) fee based on their maximum CP balance during the active period mentioned above.

James Guy Dalley Arkins (14 October 1888 – 2 August 1980) was an Australian politician.
Born in Millthorpe, New South Wales, he was educated at public schools before becoming a builder. In 1915 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Labor member for Castlereagh. After the Labor split of 1916 over conscription, Arkins joined the Nationalist Party. While still an MLA, he served in the military from 1916-1919. In 1920 he transferred to the seat of St George, and in 1927 to Rockdale. He contested Waverley in 1932, following the abolition of Rockdale, but was defeated by William Clementson.
On 26 September 1935, Arkins was appointed to the Australian Senate as a member of the United Australia Party (UAP) (successor to the Nationalist Party), filling the vacancy caused by the death of NSW Senator Lionel Courtenay, who had died 11 days after being sworn in. In the 1937 federal election, an election was held for four NSW Senate seats, all of which were won by the Labor Party using the infamous "four A's" strategy, whereby the ALP selected candidates whose names all began with the letter A.
Arkins returned to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, winning Dulwich Hill in 1938 and holding it until 1941. He died in 1980.

Cavedweller

Cavedweller is the second novel from critically acclaimed author Dorothy Allison. Much like her award-winning novel, "Bastard Out of Carolina", "Cavedweller" deals with domestic violence, friendship among women, mother-daughter bonds, and poverty in the small-town South. Although the point of view shifts throughout the novel, the story is told primarily from the perspective of Delia Byrd.
Plot.
Delia Byrd is a native of Cayro, Georgia and a recovering alcoholic who lives in Los Angeles with her surly ten-year-old daughter, Cissy. The former lead singer of the obscure blues-rock band Mud Dog, Delia is supported primarily by Randall Pritchard, Cissy's father and a member of Mud Dog. The novel opens with Randall being killed in a motorcycle accident. Grief-stricken, nearly penniless, and desperate to reconcile with the daughters she left behind in Georgia, Delia packs up her daughter and drives nearly non-stop cross-country.
When she arrives in Cayro, she is confronted by townspeople who think she is a "hussy" for having left her two daughters despite being aware of the fact that Delia's husband was often abusive toward her. After a disappointing reunion with the grandfather who raised her, Delia enrolls Cissy at the local school, gets a job as a cleaning woman and sinks into a deep depression.
After emerging from the depression, Delia embarks on a quest to regain custody of her now-pubescent daughters, Amanda and Dede, from their hateful and puritanical paternal grandmother. She enlists the aid of the preacher at her mother-in-law's church. Despite the fact that the minister is able to convince the grandmother to consent to visits, Grandma Windsor does not keep her side of the bargain. Desperate, Delia approaches the girls' father, Clint, and makes a deal with him. Clint, who is gravely ill with cancer, agrees to transfer legal custody of the girls to Delia if she moves into his house and cares for him as he is unwilling to spend his last days in a hospital. After thoroughly cleaning the house, Delia moves all three girls in.
Things between Delia and her daughters are tense at first. Fourteen-year-old Amanda is as rigid and religion obsessed as her grandmother, frequently telling Cissy that she is going to hell. Dede is a sexually precocious twelve-year-old who likes to smoke cigarettes. They initially ignore their younger sister and her mother. The two older girls also hate their father, remembering the times that he assaulted his parents.
Cissy, unable to get along with any of her female relatives, takes pity on the bedridden Clint. She begins reading to him. Eventually, Clint begins to tell her about the early days of his marriage to Delia, expressing remorse about the violence he subjected her to.
After Clint dies, Cissy and Dede form a tight bond. However, Amanda remains intractable, frequently arguing with her mother and sisters. Amanda goes on to marry an aspiring preacher and gives birth to two sons in short order. After undergoing a procedure to remove gallstones, Amanda suffers a minor nervous collapse and begins rethinking her previous religiosity.
Cissy, who has had problems fitting in at school, develops an abiding friendship with Nolan, a classmate who shares her passion for science fiction novels. Nolan eventually introduces Cissy to spelunking and falls madly in love with Dede, who scorns his advances.
Dede, who has several brushes with the law and briefly battles drug addiction, eventually gets a job managing the convenience store. After Nolan rescues Dede from a gun-toting ex-boyfriend, the two embark on a passionate love affair.
Cissy begins making plans to return to Los Angeles to study at UCLA. This leaves the forty-something Delia at loose ends as the two older girls have already left home. She has broken up with Cayro's deputy sheriff and has no romantic prospects. Delia then resolves to begin a new chapter of her life by becoming more involved with her young grandsons.
Critical reception.
This book received mostly good reviews. The "New York Times" wrote, "This is not a novel interested in formal invention, in ironic distance or even in elegant prose...It is clear-eyed about the economic forces that shape these women's lives, but it is also unabashedly emotional and hopeful about their futures. It reaches back to the conventions of straightforward storytelling and pays close attention to the way women get by, the way they come to forgive one another, the way they choose who they will be." "Time Magazine" noted that "the central story of mother and daughter runs true, both on and beneath the surface." The book made the "Los Angeles Times" Bestsellers List in 1998.

Langley Covered Bridge

Langley Covered Bridge is the longest remaining wooden covered bridge in the state of Michigan, and is located several miles north of Centreville, Michigan, the seat of St. Joseph County. Many of the covered bridges in Michigan and other states no longer exist, and therefore the structure is a historic tourist attraction frequented by visitors to St. Joseph County. The bridge is named for Thomas W. Langley and family, pioneers who helped establish the village of Centreville in the mid-19th century. In fact, Langley was the very first settler in Centreville. The red-paneled bridge, along with a causeway just to its north that forms part of Covered Bridge Road, spans the St. Joseph River. The bridge was constructed in 1887 by nearby Parkville builder Pierce Bodmer. It does this just above what is called the Sturgis Dam (although the city of Sturgis, Michigan is located nowhere near this location). The dam is adjacent to a county recreation area called Covered Bridge Park; just across the river within sight of the bridge is Pahl Point Park, which is in fact closer to the bridge itself. The bridge has been a very important symbol for the village of Centreville for almost 100 years; in fact, the village's annual summer festival is called Covered Bridge Days.

Stanley Kerin "Stan" Amour (2 April 1900 – 29 November 1979) was an Australian politician. Born in Hamilton, New South Wales, he was educated at Catholic schools before becoming an insurance agent. He served in the military from 1915-1917. In 1937, he was elected to the Australian Senate as a Labor Senator for New South Wales. He was selected largely because his surname began with A, as did the other three candidates, Bill Ashley, John Armstrong and Tom Arthur. After leaving the ALP briefly for the Langite Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist), Amour served in the Senate for over 20 years, retiring in 1965. He died in 1979.

Yuyuanozoon

Yuyuanozoon magnificissimi is the largest known vetulicolian, with the holotype (and only known specimen) measuring about 202 millimeters in length. In life, it would have been an egg-shaped animal with a long cylindrical tail. The body is divided into 6 segments, with a gill opening (that has gill filaments extending out from each opening) placed symmetrically on each side of every body segment starting at the second segment. The cylindrical tail is divided into 7 segments, and differs from the tails of all other known vetulicolians (not being flattened like vetulicolids like "Vetulicola", and didazoonids like "Didazoon", and is unlike the tails of banffozoans like "Banffia" and "Skeemella").
The details of the tail anatomy, and of the gill openings with gill filaments currently leave "Y. magnificissimi" as "incertae sedis".
Etymology.
The generic name translates as "Animal of Yu Yuan," Yu Yuan being an ancient name for Chengjiang County. The specific name, "magnificissimi", translates as "magnificent," in reference to the great size of the holotype.

Saint Maria Goretti High School (Pennsylvania)

Saint Maria Goretti High School was an all-female Roman Catholic high school located at 1736 South Tenth Street in the South Philadelphia area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. In 2004 the school, which was a part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, merged with Saint John Neumann High School to form Saints John Neumann and Maria Goretti Catholic High School.
History.
Goretti opened in 1955. In 1992 Goretti had 970 students. In October 1992 consultants told the archdiocese that Neumann and Goretti should be consolidated onto Neumann's site. By December of that year the archdiocese decided not to consolidate the two schools. In 2003 Goretti had 683 students and the school had a stable financial situation. By then the combined populations of both schools declined by 29 percent in an 11 year span. In March 2003 the archdiocese asked the faculty and staff of Neumann to consider merging or closing the school as the school had increasing deficits and a decreasing student population. In June of that year the committees unanimously requested a merge. In September of that year Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the head of the Philadelphia Archdiocese, decided that the merge should occur.

Yuan Haowen

Yuan Haowen () also known as Yuan Yishan (遺山/遗山) or “Yuan of Yi Mountain” (1190–1257) was a poet from Xinzhou, in what is now Shanxi province, noted for his poems in the "ci" and the "sanqu" forms and for including poems in the "sangluan" genre of Classical Chinese poetry among his poetic works. Yuan Haowen was the outstanding literary figure of his period, in northern China, excelling at various genres of both prose and poetry: his "ci" poetry is said to be some of the best of the Jin period writers. Just a few of his "sanqu" lyrics have survived. Yuan Haowen was born in the territory of the Jurchen Jin Dynasty, in what is now northern China, and which was co-existent with the Chinese Southern Song Dynasty.
Biography.
Yuan Haowen's ancestors were of non-Chinese origins who changed their surname to Yuan. His father experienced disappointments in life and later led a secluded existence. However he passed on his taste for literature to his son. An uncle who was a government official took the young Yuan along on his official journeys, thus introducing him to some well known places and scenery. He could compose poetry by the age of seven leading people to refer to him as a child prodigy. His uncle also saw to it that he studied with the best teachers. He prospered. Born at the height of the Jin Dynasty (1115–1234), he experienced the social unrest and war at the decline of the dynasty. He fled to Henan with his mother when the Jin regime moved their capital. He had served the Jin in a variety of posts, but when the Jin Dynasty gave way in favor of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty he no longer sought official appointments and went into retirement. In June, 1233, Yuan Haowen was captured and compelled to go to Shandong. For a time he was a destitute wanderer.
Translation.
Settling Down in My Wife’s Family Dongyuan Country Place
Layers of hills cut off the dust of the world.
In villages, rich harvest years.
I had to move here
For the peaks through my windows
And pines behind my hut.
Every tenth year pines are planted,
And every year the grain.
Those are left for the boy.
For this old man –
The bright moon after sobering up,
The clear wind after drinking.

Fjords in Canada

Fjords in Canada, (fiords in Canada), are long, narrow inlets characterized by steep sides, created in a valley carved by glacial activity. A fjord can have two or more basins separated by sills. The bowls can have a depth of and the dividing sills can raise up to a few metres below the water surface. Mountainous glaciated areas in Canada are along the British Columbia Coast: from the Alaskan border along the Portland Canal to Indian Arm. Kingcome Inlet is a typical West Coast fjord.
Lesser fjords in Canada are located along the coastline of Newfoundland and Labrador such as Saglek Fjord, Nachvak Fjord, Anaktalâk Bay, Western Brook Pond, Hebron Fjord, and Bonne Bay in Gros Morne National Park.
Quebec's Saguenay River valley contains a fjord. The Saguenay Fjord is long and deep.
The Canadian Arctic Archipelago also features fjords such as those around Ellesmere and Baffin Island, including Alexandra Fjord, Ellesmere Island, and Sam Ford Fjord, Baffin Island.
When a portion of the high cliff wall falls off, it may cause a tsunami. This occurred in the early 20th century at Western Brook Pond of Gros Morne National Park when a tsunami was created after "Broke Off Cliff" fell.
In this listing, a fjord may consist of several complex waterways. These waterways may contribute to the length of the fjord. For more information on these please see the main fjord source or Wikipedia article. Some examples are Dean Channel and Douglas Channel. The locality of Hagensborg in the Bella Coola Valley in the Dean Channel fjord was settled by Norwegian immigrants in 1894 as it reminded them of home. The total length of the fjord from the head of Dean Channel to the mouth of Fitz Hugh Sound is about rivalling Hardangerfjord in Norway for length. The Hardangerfjord, the Queen of fjords, at a length of is claimed to be fourth largest fjord in the world and second largest of Norway.
Anaktalak Fjord, Saglek Fjord and Nachvak Fjord off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador are being studied for environmental changes due to global warming. Increased tourism and marine traffic, contaminants from air, water or industrial pollution, changing weather patterns are affecting what once had been pristine water basins of the fjords protected by sills.
According to the article, Portland Canal, the use of the word "canal" to name fjords/inlets on the British Columbia Coast and the Alaska Panhandle is a legacy of the Spanish exploration of the area in the 18th century. For example, Haro Strait between Victoria and the San Juan Islands was originally "Canal de Haro". The English cognate to the Spanish "canal" is "channel", which is found throughout the coast, cf. Dean Channel.
The article, Sechelt Inlet, states that fjords on the British Columbia Coast have rapids, which are termed skookumchucks which means "strong waters" (tidal rapid) in Chinook Jargon, the old coastal trade language). Skookumchuks are caused by the typical shallows near the mouth of a fjord as the volume of water inside the fjord's depths tries to pour out to, or in from, the more open waters beyond.
The phenomenon of Mountain-gap wind or squamish or outflow affects the fjords of Canada and Norway. The outflow winds at the Salt and Bols fjords of Norway and the Howe Sound and Portland Inlet of Canada have been compared. European winds may be termed Bora. The cold dry air of the continental interior seeks out the easier passage through the fjord valley creating hurricane force winds.
According to the definition, fjord, Western Brook Pond, in Newfoundland's Gros Morne National Park, is also often described as a fjord, but is actually a freshwater lake cut off from the sea, so is not a fjord in the English sense of the term. Such lakes are sometimes called "fjord lakes". It is of interest to note that Pissing Mare Falls at high, is one of several waterfalls to drain into Western Brook Pond, Along the British Columbia Coast, a notable fjord-lake is Owikeno Lake, which is a freshwater extension of Rivers Inlet.

What's Left? The Death of Social Democracy

"What's Left? The Death Of Social Democracy" is written by Australian Professor Clive Hamilton and was published as Issue 21 of the Quarterly Essay in 2006. In "What's Left?" Hamilton comments on topics written about in his previous books "Growth Fetish" and "". He argues that there is an emergence of new forms of "alienation and exploitation", and what he calls the ravages of the free market and the profit motive. According to Hamilton, they have "robbed life of its meaning".
Hamilton defines alienation as the inability or incapacity for people to lead authentic lives and to manifest who they are. He contends that there is a massive advertising industry designed to persuade us that the way to a happy and fulfilling life is to "go shopping, to construct an identity, a sense of self, by the brands we buy, by the goods we have and put on display".

Sweet Dreams (Beyoncé song)

"Sweet Dreams" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her third studio album, "I Am... Sasha Fierce" (2008). Originally titled "Beautiful Nightmare", it was leaked online in March 2008. The song was written and produced by Knowles, James Scheffer, Wayne Wilkins, and Rico Love. Columbia Records released "Sweet Dreams", the album's sixth single, to mainstream radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists in the United States on June 2, 2009, and elsewhere from July 13. It is an adventurous song composed in a synthpop arrangement and its instrumentation includes synthesizers, a keyboard, and snare drums. Knowles employs slinky vocals to sing the haunting lyrics, which describe a romantic relationship that the female protagonist believes could be a dream.
"Sweet Dreams" was critically acclaimed by contemporary music critics, who praised its beats, synthpop sound and Knowles' vocals. Some critics noted that the sliding bassline gave the song a dark quality and resembles the one used in some of Michael Jackson's songs on "Thriller" (1983) . "Sweet Dreams" gained popularity for its electro music style, which contrasts Knowles' earlier R&B, urban, and funk-tinged releases. The song was nominated for the Viewers Choice Award at the 2010 BET Awards. It topped the New Zealand Singles Chart, peaked at number ten on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, and reached the top five on singles charts in Australia, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom among others. "Sweet Dreams" was certified platinum in Australia, New Zealand and the US.
The song's accompanying music video was directed by Adria Petty, and was filmed in Brooklyn, New York. It mainly uses a green screen and computer-generated effects, making the clip minimal and performance-based. The video features Knowles wearing a golden robot suit that was designed by French fashion designer Thierry Mugler. The video received favorable reviews from critics, who described it as high-fashion and noted that Knowles reprised part of the choreography from her 2008 video for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Knowles promoted the song by performing it live at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards and occasionally during the I Am... World Tour (2009–10). "Sweet Dreams" was recognized as one of the most performed songs of 2009 at the 27th American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Pop Music Awards. It was used in a Cryster Geyser Water Japanese advertisement that featured Knowles.
Production and recording.
Initially titled "Beautiful Nightmare", "Sweet Dreams" was among the first songs composed for the 2008 double album "I Am... Sasha Fierce". Record producer Rico Love regards writing "Sweet Dreams" with Knowles as "the experience of a lifetime". When Knowles went to the South Beat Studios in Miami Beach, Florida, she was not prepared to record and had to attend the opening concert of her husband Jay-Z's tour. However, when she heard a demo of "Sweet Dreams", she was impressed and wanted to record the song immediately.
Knowles, Wayne Wilkins and Jim Jonsin did some additional writing and produced the song alongside Love at the same studio. Knowles and Love worked on the vocal arrangements; Knowles appreciated Love's background vocals in the hook and retained them. Jim Caruana assisted in recording the music. Love then recorded Knowles' vocals; the recording session lasted for an hour. Lastly, Wilkins mixed the track. "Sweet Dreams" appears on the "Sasha Fierce" disc of "I Am... Sasha Fierce" as it allows Knowles to portray her alter ego Sasha Fierce, whom Knowles described as " fun, more sensual, more aggressive, more outspoken side and more glamorous side".
Leak and release.
"Sweet Dreams" was leaked under its original title the day after it was recorded in March 2008, eight months before the album's release. It was the first time that a single by Knowles was leaked before its inclusion on an upcoming album. She responded to the leak on her official website, thanking her fans for the positive response towards the song, before clarifying that it was just a work in progress and that she did not intend to release new material in the near future. About the leak, Love told MTV News:
I was more concerned that would feel that we did it. A lot of times producers or songwriters leak records because they feel if you put the song out there it would go [on to become a hit. Usually a leak that far in advance of an album release puts the song in serious jeopardy of being excluded from the final track list. It was frustrating. I felt like you work hard to get in the studio to work with Beyoncé. I was blessed ... that song turned out [to have nine lives.
Under the song's original title "Beautiful Nightmare", "Sweet Dreams" gained some attention in the United States, where it amassed enough airplay to chart at number forty-five on Hot Dance Club Songs chart and at number fifty-seven on Pop 100 Airplay chart. "Broken-Hearted Girl" was initially intended as the sixth US and fourth international single alongside the stateside-only single "Ego" (2009). However, its release was scrapped at the last minute, and replaced by "Sweet Dreams", which Knowles selected for a summer single release because she wanted an uptempo song that would keep people dancing. She added, "It's very rare to find an uptempo song that means something ... that's not just about going to a club or partying or being a sexy girl."
"Sweet Dreams" was added to US contemporary hit radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on June 2, 2009. Dance remixes of the song alongside the album version of "Ego" and its remixes were later released on the same digital EP on August 17, 2009, in the US. In Germany, the album version of "Sweet Dreams" and a radio edit of a remix produced by Steve Pitron and Max Sanna were made available as a digital download and as a CD single on July 13, and July 17, 2009. A different digital EP containing remixes and the music video of the song was released in the same country on July 31, 2011. On July 16, 2009, the album version and the radio edit of "Sweet Dreams" was serviced as a two-track digital single in Oceania and Europe, excluding France, where it was made available on the same format the following day. In the UK, the song was released on CD and as a stand-alone digital single on August 10, 2009. A different digital EP containing four remixes and the album version of "Sweet Dreams" was also released. On the same date, the song was released as a two-sided digital EP in mainland Europe; it contained ten remixes of "Sweet Dreams".
Composition and lyrical interpretation.
"Sweet Dreams" is a synthpop song that incorporates elements of rock, R&B and old school funk music. The song is built on undulating electro rhythms and a thumping beat; its groove fits into hip hop phrasing. "Sweet Dreams" was composed using common time in the key of E minor, with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is essentially driven by a keyboard and also has guitar, piano, synthesizer, snare drum and bass instrumentation. Many music critics noted that several components of "Sweet Dreams" are reminiscent of the songs on Michael Jackson's 1983 album "Thriller". James Montgomery of MTV News that the "gnarly low end" sounds like Michael Jackson's "Beat It" (1983). Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that the electronic bassline is similar to those used in "Thriller" (1984) and "Bad" (1987). Arielle Castillo of "Miami New Times" noted that Jackson could use the beat of "Sweet Dreams" to bring up to date his "Thriller"-era style.
The lyrics of "Sweet Dreams" are about a female protagonist who has some insecurities about her new romantic relationship; she is confused about whether her relationship with her partner is a "sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare". The song starts with a bassline, which is occasionally interrupted by spare snare kicks, drum fills and Knowles' chanting, "Turn the lights on". She then adopts slinky vocals to begin the first verse. The "expansive-yet-molecular" chorus then starts with the line, "You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare / Either way, I don’t wanna wake up from you." She shifts from a lower range to an upper range while singing the chorus lines; her vocals span from the low note D4 to the high note F♯5.
Critical reception.
Reviews.
"Sweet Dreams" was critically acclaimed by critics, some of whom praised its dark tone and electropop sound that is different from Knowles' previous work. James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that Knowles' vocals, which he called, "icy and cool, slippery like mercury nothing to scoff at either", help make the song an "undeniable smash" that is unique compared to the work of other artists. Jennifer Vineyard of the same publication argued that the rock elements and smooth vocals contribute to Knowles' "fierce" alter ego, who "dares the listener to dream of her, warning that it might be a 'beautiful nightmare'." Arielle Castillo of "Miami New Times" noted that "Sweet Dreams" is another one of Jim Jonsin's productions with a keyboard-propelled arrangement, but unlike the material Jonsin crafted for Soulja Boy, the song is "swirling, and darker". Joey Guerra of the "Houston Chronicle" and Gary Trust of "Billboard" magazine agreed that the song is one of Knowles' purest dance songs and is "an irresistible call to the dance floor". Describing "Sweet Dreams" as a "cool dance track", Dennis Amith of J!-ENT complimented its arrangement, calling it "experimental" with "cool transitions".
Adam Mazmanian of "The Washington Times" described the song as "a gritty slow grind with a salacious bassline" and noted that Knowles "delivers a near parody of a good-girl voice" while singing the chorus. Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media wrote that "Sweet Dreams" sounds like a song Rihanna would sing. Echoing Dombal's sentiments, Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote that the best song on the "Sasha Fierce" disc is a "darkelectropop track called 'Sweet Dreams', [which actually sounds like the cousin of Rihanna's 'Disturbia'". On a separate review for the single, Levine awarded "Sweet Dreams" a rating of four stars out of five, and commented that the song seduces listeners with its catchy chorus hook, and thereafter keeps them intrigued by "placing a hint of darkness just beneath the shiny, synthy surface". Spence D. of IGN Music wrote that though "Sweet Dreams" is not a "stellar track", it is superior to other album tracks, including "Diva" and "Radio". Similarly, Vicki Lutas of BBC Music wrote that even though "Sweet Dreams" appears to lack something, it is undeniably a good song overall. She added that "Sweet Dreams" may not be Knowles' finest or most memorable work, but it remains her best offering since her 2003 song "Crazy In Love". Lutas also commended Knowles' vocal delivery, which he described as "beautiful and soft, yet strong and powerful". Talia Kraines of the same publication wrote that "Sweet Dreams" is one of the standout tracks on the "Sasha Fierce" disc though Knowles does not get as experimental as she did on her 2006 song "Ring the Alarm".
Recognition and accolades.
"Sweet Dreams" earned Knowles the Best Female Vocal accolade at the 2009 Music MP3 Awards. It was nominated for Best R&B/Urban Dance Track at the 25th Annual International Dance Music Awards, but lost to The Black Eyed Peas's 2009 song "I Gotta Feeling". It was also nominated for the Viewers Choice Award at the 2010 BET Awards. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized "Sweet Dreams" as one of the most performed songs of 2009 at the 27th ASCAP Pop Music Awards. On the occasion of Knowles' thirtieth birthday, Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz of "Billboard" magazine ranked the song at number 21 on their list of Knowles' 30 biggest "Billboard" hits, and noted that its electropop sound, which was in contrast to Knowles' previous singles, showcased her range of talent. On "The Village Voice"s 2009 Pazz & Jop singles list, "Sweet Dreams" was ranked at number 114. In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number five on their list of ten best Knowles' songs, writing that Knowles "stepped away from R&B roots with this surreal electropop tune, which features these standout lyrics: 'My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere / As long as you're here, I'll be floating on air' (which, from Bey's mouth, sounds like the greatest threat ever)."
Chart performance.
"Sweet Dreams" debuted at number seventy-two on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart issue dated August 9, 2009. It peaked at number ten for two non-consecutive weeks on the charts issued dated November 7, and November 21, 2009. The song became Knowles' thirteenth top ten Hot 100 single as a solo artist during 2001–10, and tied her with Ludacris and T-Pain for second-most top tens on the chart since 2000; Knowles' husband Jay-Z leads with fourteen in that period. Knowles' is the third song titled "Sweet Dreams" to reach the top ten of the Hot 100 chart, following "Sweet Dreams" by Air Supply in 1982 and "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics in 1983.
"Sweet Dreams" peaked at number forty-eight on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, making "I Am... Sasha Fierce" the first album of the 21st century to have seven entries on that chart. For the week ending September 12, 2009, it topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart; it became Knowles' eleventh number-one song, and was the fourth song from "I Am... Sasha Fierce" to top that chart. "Sweet Dreams" tied Knowles with Kristine W for second-most number one songs on the Hot Dance Club Songs during 2001-10. The song peaked at number five for three consecutive weeks on the US Pop Songs chart in November 2009. "Sweet Dreams" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipment of one million digital copies. As of October 2012, it had sold 1,691,000 digital downloads in the US.
"Sweet Dreams" also performed well outside the US. In the UK, the song initially entered the UK Singles Chart more than a month before its physical release, on July 5, 2009, at number one hundred and eighty-nine. The following week, it rose to number fifty-two, and thereafter continuously ascended the chart; it peaked at number five on August 9, 2009, and became Knowles' sixth top five single in the UK as a solo artist. The song was last seen on the UK Singles Chart on January 17, 2010, after spending 26 weeks in the top 100. On July 16, 2009, "Sweet Dreams" debuted at number seventeen on the Irish Singles Chart and climbed to its peak position at number four in its fourth charting week. The single stayed in top ten for eight weeks and left the chart after spending nineteen consecutive weeks on it.
For the week ending June 18, 2009, "Sweet Dreams" was the most added song on Australian radio stations. On August 9, 2009, it peaked at number two on the Australian Singles Chart, and became the highest charting single from "I Am... Sasha Fierce" in Australia. The song spent thirty-eight consecutive weeks in the top 100, where it last charted on March 1, 2010; it was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipping 70,000 copies. In New Zealand, "Sweet Dreams" debuted at number thirty-nine, and peaked at number one for three consecutive weeks. It was the most added song on New Zealand radios as from September 21, 2009 to November 2, 2009. The song was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), representing shipment of 15,000 copies.
Music video.
Background and concept.
The accompanying music video for "Sweet Dreams" was directed by Adria Petty, whom Knowles chose because of her intelligence and beautiful visual references. After Knowles learned the choreography in Los Angeles, the video was shot in a studio in Brooklyn, New York City. It was the seventh video released from "I Am... Sasha Fierce", and the second to have complete color throughout; "Halo" was the first. Knowles described it as more "graphic" when compared to the previous six videos; its motive was to "take Sasha to the next level". In the video, Knowles' alter ego is symbolized by the golden robot suit she wears; it was designed by French fashion designer Thierry Mugler.
A green-screen and computer-generated effects were used for the video to create a minimal and performance-based clip. The computer-generated imagery (CGI) was employed to create a context-less void; the CGI effects were used to delete the background and setting before creating a void-like digital canvas for the dance routine that is executed by Knowles and her dancers Ebony Williams and Ashley Everett, who all sport numerous flashy and symmetrical costumes throughout the video. Accordingly, there were no concerns of cutting; the images were easily merged into one another using computers. A high number of camera lens glare effects was used in the video, part of which was inspired by British designer Gareth Pugh's Autumn/Winter 2009 video presentation. Knowles further explained that the fashion and choreography were the main elements of the music video:
The fashion was extremely important in this video because everything was so minimal ... With the choreography, we really focused on hitting all of the accents in the drum beat. What makes this choreography so interesting is that in one instance, it is very staccato and hard... And the next instance; the movement is very smooth and there are lots of melts with inter-kit movement in the fingers and hands.
On June 12, 2009, a behind-the-scenes video, which Knowles dance rehearsal, was released; Knowles was dressed in golden costumes and was performing some robotic movements The music video of "Sweet Dreams" was not included on the remixes and video album "Above and Beyoncé – Video Collection & Dance Mixes" as it was not finished when the CD/DVD collection was made; instead, a "Making of Sweet Dreams" video was included. A 30-second clip from the video was posted online on July 8, 2009; it showed Knowles alongside her two female back-up dancers in a virtual desert. The following day, the full video was leaked online but was soon deleted after Knowles' label issued warnings to infringing websites. The video for "Sweet Dreams" premiered on MTV later the same day.
Synopsis and analysis.
The video opens with Knowles tossing and turning in her bed; her idea was to make the opening shot look like "a dark fairy tale
". As she tries to sleep, Brahms's Lullaby plays softly in the background. She then levitates off her bed using her stomach muscles to move the top half of her body. Knowles said that the levitation shot was the hardest one as she had difficulties making her neck look straight. She added that the scene represents the nightmare and the white bird flying above her takes her into her dream, which unfolds after the screech of an electric guitar. Knowles is transported to a desert and several clouds are present in the background. She wears a black Roberto Cavalli dress and boots; as the music begins, her two backup dancers wearing Gareth Pugh pieces appear. The scene changes into a computer-generated sci-fi landscape where Knowles is inscribed with a circle and square in a similar fashion to Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man". The first chorus is brought in by a subtle glass-breaking sound effect as the sci-fi special effects disappear and Knowles appears in a silver one-shouldered mini dress on a white background. Accompanied by her backup dancers, she performs sophisticated, street and hip-busting dance moves.
The second chorus shows Knowles wearing a silver lined body suit while smashing mirrors. During the bridge, the video fades to black and white and Knowles appears wearing the gold robot suit, and gold and diamond nail rings valued at $36,000 and designed by Bijules designer Jules Kim. She executes some robotic movements. As the chorus begins to play for the third and final time, digital doubling and mirroring are used to create a collection of dance moves and multiple images Knowles arching her back. The gold outfit is then reused, this time in color. Knowles performs another dance routine with her two backup dancers, then says, "Turn the lights out", and the video ends.
Reception.
James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that the video is "an eye-popping, herky-jerky, high-fashion" one. He praised the way Knowles "her pelvis in ways never imagined", and the wardrobe changes in the clip, before concluding: "She expands on her burgeoning robot fetish, flashes the crazy eyes and contorts her body in downright unsettling ways. All of which is to say that 'Sweet Dreams' is just like every amazingly crazy Beyoncé video from the past three years, which — to extend the point — also means that it's pretty great." Olivia Smith of "Daily News" noted that in the video, Knowles references Jane Fonda in the movie "Barbarella" (1968), Tin Woodman and Pamela Anderson through the different costumes she wears. Smith further compared the video with the one for "Single Ladies", writing that Knowles reprises some of the moves as she "can only swivel those hips in so many ways". Brandon Soderberg of Slant Magazine described the introductory part of the video as a David Lynch-like mixture of eroticism and symbolism. He wrote that the video was "one part "Victoria's Secret" commercial, another part dream logic anti-narrative, and a CGI-assisted freakout all around". Soderberg commended the video for being "an excess of body and action, not filmic techniques", adding that the dancing in the video "blow[s our minds anew".
"Rolling Stone" found similarities between the video for "Sweet Dreams", Kanye West's video for "Paranoid" (2009) and the cover artworks of English rock band Yes. Canadian magazine "Dose" also compared the video with "Paranoid" due to their similar dream sequences. Nadia Mendoza of "The Sun" further compared Knowles' look in the video with Lady Gaga's. Vicki Lutas of the BBC did not appreciate the first 30 seconds of the video, writing that "the dark, horror-type music, the pumping heartbeat, the equally spooky lullaby, the screech of an electric guitar", gave her the impression that she was watching "some magician, with a Knowles soundtrack". However, she complimented the rest of the video writing that "things (thankfully) move away from the Hallowe'en cheese and into familiar Beyoncé territory (right from the fact it's proper [1980s pop through to the video essentially being 'Single Ladies' with Beyoncé and 2 dancers)". Lutas concluded that the video might not be remembered for long or hailed as Beyoncé's finest and more memorable work, but it remains one of the best music videos from Knowles she has seen since "Crazy In Love". Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared the dancing moves in the video with those in "Single Ladies".
The video stayed at number one for several weeks on the UK TV Airplay Chart in August and September 2009. It was ranked at number 13 on BET's "Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009" countdown. Tamar Anitai of MTV placed the video at number three on his list of the best five videos of 2009, wrote that it "isn't just another high-fashion look at Beyoncé ... " and continued, "It's the dark yin to the brighter, lighter fare of 'Single Ladies.' This is a 360-degree look at Beyoncé's life: Beyoncé the woman, Sasha Fierce the performer, and the powerful force that occupies the spaces in between.". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number ten on their list of Knowles' ten best music videos, praising Knowles' sexy robotic look.
Promotion.
Knowles was due to perform "Sweet Dreams" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13. However, last minute changes were brought to her performance that night; wearing a leotard and a silver glove, Knowles sang a short drum-led remix of "Sweet Dreams" before switching to "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", accompanied by two female backup dancers. Wearing a red Agent Provocateur corset, stockings and long satin gloves, Knowles sang "Sweet Dreams" at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 5. She appeared on stage in a heart-shaped bed with satin sheets and later leapt up and performed a choreography to the song. A "Daily Mail" reporter wrote that the live performance was "triumphant" and "much to the delight of the audience". Charly Wilder of "Spin" magazine commented that Knowles overshadowed American singer Katy Perry's "tweaked-out pinup shtick with her mesmerizing, sexed-up rendition" of "Sweet Dreams". Gordon Smart of "The Sun" commented that Knowles stole the show with the "iconic" performance of the song and "eye-popping" look.
"Sweet Dreams" was not regularly performed on the I Am... World Tour, a 2009–10 world tour in support of "I Am... Sasha Fierce". Knowles sang an acoustic and downtempo rendition of the song live during the revue I Am... Yours that was held at the Encore Theater in Las Vegas on August 2, 2009. She blended it into a romantic medley that also included her 2003 song "Dangerously in Love" and Anita Baker's 1986 song "Sweet Love". The performance was subsequently included on her 2009 CD/DVD live album "". Knowles performed "Sweet Dreams" live at the Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011; she mixed it with the 1983 song "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", originally performed by the British pop music duo Eurythmics. "Sweet Dreams" was used in a commercial for Crystal Geyser bottled water in which Knowles appeared; she dances and drinks water while the song is played in the background.
Cover versions.
An unofficial remix, featuring American rappers Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj, was leaked on some websites on March 9, 2010, and was included on Wayne's 2010 mixtape "No Ceilings". The Big Pink, an English electro-rock duo consisting multi-instrumentalists Robbie Furze and Milo Cordell, covered "Sweet Dreams" in a live session for BBC Radio 1 on November 7, 2009. They also performed the song live on at the 2010 Isle of Wight Festival on June 13, 2010. The cover later became a B-side to their 2010 single "Tonight". Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" commented that The Big Pink's version of "Sweet Dreams" had a "disarmingly flat affect, delivering it as the ramble of a neurotic" when compared to the original recording sung by Knowles. Likewise, Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal felt that their cover "obliterates the original's Hi-NRG pulse, turning it into something a lot moodier and creepier". British soul and R&B singer Lemar covered "Sweet Dreams" in his Biz Session in January 2011. On November 1, 2010, American professional basketball player, Shaquille O'Neal, dressed as his female alter ego Shaquita for Halloween, and gave a lip-synching performance of Knowles' "Sweet Dreams". In September 2011, Jade Collins covered "Sweet Dreams" during an episode of the ninth series of "The X Factor". On October 27, 2012, boy band Union J covered the song during the same season of the show and released the cover through the iTunes Store as a single the same day.
Jessica Sanchez cover.
On March 28, 2012, Jessica Sanchez, a contestant of the eleventh season of "American Idol", covered "Sweet Dreams". She performed a slow-tempo ballad version of the song accompanied at the beginning by harps. Her performance received favorable comments and a standing ovation from the judges of the show. Jennifer Lopez commented, "You did a beautiful job on it ... If I was Beyoncé and I was home and I heard that, I'd be like 'I got to do that in my next concert, slow that one down.'" Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as "great" while Randy Jackson noted that it was "unbelievable, sensational". James Montgomery of MTV News graded her performance with a B, and called the cover "a bit of an odd choice, and yet also a supremely confident one". He added, "For once, she pulled things back, and maybe suffered a bit for doing so, but there were still plenty of subtly great moments, particularly in the verses. Might not have been her best—it definitely lacked in vocal fireworks ... And really, it was good enough".
Mellisa Locker of "Rolling Stone" praised Sanchez's performance, calling it a "brilliant job" and adding that "it's risky, but Beyoncé has done it, and if anyone can pull off a dazzling repeat performance, it's Jessica". She further compared the performance with the dream sequence from the 1945 film "Spellbound" but noted that it was "slightly weirder" Jim Farber of the "Daily News" commented that "her take on a song by her clear role model, Beyoncé, showed too much similarity in their timbres and phrasing, making Sanchez's voice seem redundant ... despite the fact she switched up the arrangement of the bootylicious song she chose, 'Sweet Dreams.'" Laura Schreffler of the "Daily Mail" described Sanchez' performance as "pared-down, show-stopping ... a floaty, dreamy, confection that wows the judges." Amy Reiter of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote, "Sanchez gave yet another perfectly calibrated performance with Beyoncé's 'Sweet Dreams,' balancing restraint and power. Everything from her voice to her dress to the red door she walked through seemed polished and tour-ready." "The Arizona Republic"s Randy Cordova praised the performance, saying that the slow-tempo version allowed Sanchez "to really delve into the song's emotional core". "The Hollywood Reporter"s Erin Carlson praised the tonned-down theatrical stage during the performance and Sanchez's vibrato voice, further describing the performance as a "near-perfection".

Myōkoku-ji

History.
Myokokuji Temple (109m by 182m) was established by Nichiko Shonin in 1592 and has been rebuilt several times since then. When Osaka Castle was burnt down in 1615 during the Summer War of Osaka, Toyotomi forces also burnt down Myokokuji Temple because they had heard that their enemy, Ieyasu Tokugawa, was hiding inside. The buildings of Myokokuji were rebuilt in 1628, but were again destroyed in World War II in July 1945. In autumn of 1973 the present buildings were built again for the third time.
Sacred Tree: The Great Cycad.
The cycad tree in the temple is over 1100 years old and is well known for its mysterious history. Oda Nobunaga, a major daimyo during the Sengoku era who tried to unite Japan in 1580, transplanted this cycad to Azuchi Castle in what is now Shiga prefecture. However, every night a strange voice was heard in Azuchi Castle saying “Take me back to Myokokuji”, and an unnatural atmosphere covered the castle and disturbed the people there. This angered Nobunaga and he let his men cut the tree down. The tree is said to have bled from the blows, fainted from the pain and looked so much like a great snake that even brave Nobunaga became afraid and sent the tree back to Myokokuji. Upon receiving the dying cycad Nichiko Shonin felt sorry for the tree and recited 1000 Hokkekyo (sutras) for it. A god with a face of a man and a body of a snake appeared in his dream saying “Thank you for your prayers. In return, I will swear three oaths. First, I will ease the pain of childbirth. Second, I will free those from the tragedy of hardship. Third, I will give happiness to those who are poor.” Shonin named this guardian god of the temple Ugatoku-ryujin and built a hall on the location. On December 13, 1923 the tree became a national natural monument.
Sakai Incident.
On February 15, Keiō 4, (March 8, 1868) almost 100 sailors from a French warship offshore boarded boats and landed at Sakai Port. They came into Sakai for sightseeing and loitered inside temples and shrines and scared women and children who were astonished by the foreigners. The guardians of Myōkoku-ji Temple from the Tosa clan sought out the French sailors, but were unable to resolve the problem because of mass confusion and the inability to understand each others' language. When the French sailors took a flag from the Tosa clan, the samurai opened fire on the sailors, killing thirteen. The French returned fire and retreated to their boat and this incident became an international problem. France pressed Japan for compensation and Japan was forced to pay a large sum of money and twenty samurai involved in the incident were ordered to commit "seppuku". On February 23 in front of Myōkoku-ji Temple with witnesses from both countries present the samurai began to cut their stomachs open. The sun had already set by the time eleven samurai had committed "seppuku". The French witnesses hastily left the temple and the remaining nine samurai were ordered to stop "seppuku" and were later exiled back to Tosa (Kochi Prefecture) by the government. Like many other samurai, these Tosa samurai died in service of their country. However, because Myōkoku-ji temple is a designated temple by Imperial Order, the burial of the samurai was not permitted on Myōkoku-ji temple grounds. Their remains are kept at the nearby Hojuin Temple.

Congo Grille

Congo Grille is a chain of family restaurants in the Philippines named for its African jungle-themed interiors. In contrast to the decor, the cuisine is predominantly Filipino with a smidgen of Western and Chinese foods. The award-winning restaurant is also popularly known as "The Sisig King" for its recent achievements in a food feast celebrating the favorite Filipino dish. The chain has plans to build stores overseas, especially in the United States.
History.
Congo Grille was established in 1999 by Kenneth Sytin and his brothers. That year, the business had as many as 13,000 customers a month and was dubbed "the fastest growing grill in town." In 2006, Congo Grill participated in the Annual Sisig Festival held in Angeles City, Pampanga. Their pork "sisig" and two other sisig dishes won first prizes in the major categories.
The restaurant operates based on three concepts; a Philippine restaurant in an air conditioned environment, food without monosodium glutamate, and a mascot (an ape in a safari outfit) for entertaining youngsters. Congo Grille was opened for franchising in 2008.
The first franchised-operated store opened at the Araneta Center in 2009.
Charities.
In 2007, Congo Grille, along with other companies, organized a party to feed 407 children of low-income families in the city of Valenzuela. This was part of a program dealing with nationwide hunger.
Two years later, they teamed up with local television network GMA 7 in feeding low-income individuals. Workers of the restaurant chain offered meals to 300 people in Quezon City, its birthplace. Toys and other collectibles were also donated.

<doc id="20146634" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20146634" title="Arthur Roche">
Arthur Roche

Arthur Roche (born 6 March 1950) is an English archbishop of the Catholic Church. On 26 June 2012, he was named by Pope Benedict XVI to serve as the Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, at which time he was raised to his current rank.
Roche had served as the ninth Bishop of Leeds, having served previously as Coadjutor Bishop of Leeds and, before that, as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Westminster, England's principal Catholic diocese.
Early life and ministry.
Arthur Roche was born in the village of Batley Carr, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Arthur and Frances Roche. He attended St Joseph's Primary School, St John Fisher High School and Christleton Hall. From 1969 to 1975, he studied at St Alban's College in Valladolid, Spain, where he obtained a degree in theology from the Comillas Pontifical University. Upon his return to England, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop William Wheeler for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leeds on 19 July 1975.
Roche's first appointment in the diocese was as assistant priest at Holy Rood Church in Barnsley until 1978, when he became private secretary to Bishop William Gordon Wheeler. He was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the diocese in 1979. From 1982 to 1989, he served on the staff of St Anne's Cathedral in Leeds, and helped to organise the visit of Pope John Paul II to York in May 1982.
Roche was the diocesan Financial Secretary from 1986 to 1991, during which time he was also named parish priest St Wilfrid's Church in January 1989. In 1991, he furthered his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and later became spiritual director of the Venerable English College. He was appointed General Secretary of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales (April 1996) and raised to rank of Honorary Prelate of His Holiness.
Episcopal career.
On 12 April 2001, Roche was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster and Titular Bishop of "Rusticiana" by John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 10 from Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, with Bishops David Konstant and Victor Guazzelli serving as co-consecrators.
Bishop of Leeds.
Roche was named Coadjutor Bishop of the Diocese of Leeds on 16 July 2002 and succeeded upon the resignation of Konstant on 7 April 2004, becoming the ninth Bishop of Leeds. In July 2002, he was elected chairman of the International Commission on English in the Liturgy, which oversees the translation of the Mass into English.
Roche's name had been mentioned as a possible successor to Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor as Archbishop of Westminster and thus leader of the Church in England and Wales. He was even said to be the cardinal's favoured candidate. His name had also been mentioned as a possible successor to Archbishop Kevin McDonald as Archbishop of Southwark. However, he was not appointed to either of those posts.
As the official chairman of the International Commission on English in the Liturgy, Roche announced that the new translation of the Mass into English was ready. This new translation of the Roman Missal was introduced into Catholic parishes in the United Kingdom in September 2011.
Congregation for Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments.
On 26 June 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Roche as Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, raising him to the dignity of Archbishop at the same time. Along with the dignity of archbishop, he was also given the title Bishop Emeritus of Leeds. He was appointed Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Leeds on his new appointment to the Holy See to ensure that what was already in place or had been planned and authorised would go ahead.

Gentleman detective

The gentleman detective is a type of fictional character. He (or, less commonly, she) has long been a staple of crime fiction, particularly in detective novels and short stories set in Britain in the Golden Age. The heroes of these adventures are typically both gentlemen by conduct and also members of the British gentry. The literary heroes being in opposition to professional police force detectives from the working classes.
"Gentlemen detectives" include amateurs, private detectives and professional policemen. They are always well educated, frequently have unusual or eccentric hobbies, and are commonly found in their natural environment, an English country house. This type of British detective forms a contrast to the less cerebral and more 'hard boiled' style of hero in American crime fiction. See the history of American hardboiled fiction.
Early examples.
Gentlemen detectives appeared early in modern detective fiction, which began in the late 19th century.
C. Auguste Dupin, created by Edgar Allan Poe, is widely considered to be the first fictional detective in English literature. He appeared in three short stories written in the 1840s: "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" (1841), "The Mystery of Marie Rogêt" (1842) and "The Purloined Letter" (1844).
Poe created Dupin before the word "detective" had been coined, but began many common elements of detective fiction: Dupin shares some features with the later gentleman detective. He was "…the first fictional detective of importance and the model for virtually every cerebral crime solver who followed." More specifically, Dorothy L. Sayers noted that "Sherlock Holmes modelled himself to a large extent upon (Poe's) Dupin, substituting cocaine for candlelight, with accompaniments of shag and fiddle-playing." 
Dupin is French, not English, but is probably a "gentleman". He comes from a once wealthy family but has been reduced "by a variety of untoward events" to more humble circumstances. He is entirely amateur and contents himself only with the basic necessities of life. He lives in Paris with his close friend, the anonymous narrator of the stories. Like the much later Lord Peter Wimsey (see below), Dupin is a bibliophile, and met his narrator friend while both were searching for "the same rare and very remarkable volume" in an obscure library. For hobbies, Dupin is "fond" of enigmas, conundrums, and hieroglyphics. Dupin also bears the French title "Chevalier", meaning that he is a knight in the Légion d'honneur.
The classic British gentleman detective appears soon after Poe's Dupin. A gentleman amateur is the ultimate hero of The Moonstone (1868), a famous epistolary novel widely considered the first true detective novel in English. Its author, Wilkie Collins was a lawyer, and a close friend of Charles Dickens. Collins also used gifted amateurs to solve his somewhat earlier mystery novel, The Woman in White (1859).
In The Moonstone, "Rachel Verinder" is the only child of a rich, aristocratic widow. On her eighteenth birthday, she is bequeathed an enormous diamond; that night, this 'moonstone' is stolen from the country house of her mother, "Lady Verinder". After local police are baffled, a Bow Street Runner called "Sergeant Cuff" is called in. Sergeant Cuff is honourable and skilful, but he is "not" a gentleman, and is unable to break Rachel's reticence about what is clearly an inside job.
The mystery is eventually solved by "Franklin Blake", who is a gifted amateur—and definitely a member of the gentry. The social difference between Collins' two detectives is nicely shown by their relationships with the Verinder family: Sergeant Cuff becomes a great friend of Lady Verinder's steward (chief servant), whereas Franklin Blake eventually marries Rachel, her daughter.
The most famous of all fictional detectives, Sherlock Holmes, may also be considered a gentleman, at least by background. Holmes was the creation of Scottish author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He appeared in four novels and fifty-six short stories, all but four stories narrated by his associate, the equally famous Dr Watson. These works cover in fiction a period from around 1878 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. Both characters also appear in many non-canonical novels and stories.
Holmes is a brilliant London-based and self-styled "consulting detective". In their debut (the 1887 novel, A Study in Scarlet), he tells Watson that this occupation is unique (which at that date it was). As a retired army doctor, Dr Watson is far closer to the stereotypic English gentleman than Holmes, yet has no social reservations about beginning his long association with the detective. In the best traditions of the gentry, Holmes proves to be physically brave, and competent with fists, sword and pistol. Like the earlier Dupin and the later Lord Peter Wimsey (see below), Holmes is also a competent cryptanalyst (for instance, The Dancing Men, 1903).
Conan Doyle never gave much background about Holmes' family, but his hero was apparently born in 1854 (estimated from His Last Bow, 1917). He also has an eccentric older brother, Mycroft Holmes, a senior public servant and member of the Diogenes Club. As further indirect evidence that Holmes is an educated gentleman, Conan Doyle indicates that Holmes is fluent in Latin (A Study in Scarlet, 1887), and as the series continues his speech is replete with references to the Bible, Shakespeare, and even Goethe. Holmes had earlier attended university, where he began his detecting as an amateur (The Gloria Scott, 1893, and The Musgrave Ritual, 1893). A violinist himself, Holmes loves music (The Red-Headed League, 1890), sometimes to the point of eccentricity; in The Bruce-Partington Plans (1912), Watson reports that "Holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus."
Gentlemen detectives from the Golden Age.
The renowned crime writers of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction were mostly British and mostly women. They all produced at least one gentleman detective. Their books featuring these characters are still generally in print.
Modern examples.
Several modern day fictional characters may be considered examples of gentlemen detectives.
These include Adam Dalgliesh, created by P. D. James, and Inspector Morse, created by Colin Dexter. Like Alleyn but unlike earlier gifted amateurs such as Wimsey, Campion or Miss Marple, both Dalgliesh and Morse are professional policemen.
Dalgliesh flourishes in the Metropolitan Police, despite being definitely gentry where such a background may be a disadvantage. Like the earlier Miss Marple, Dalgliesh is the child of an Anglican clergyman. He is somewhat of a recluse and, more eccentrically, a successful poet. However, Morse works in Oxford and is (or was) upwardly mobile: he apparently won a scholarship to Oxford but subsequently failed. Like Alleyn and Wimsey, Morse served in the British army before joining the police; unlike them, he served not as a commissioned officer in a prestigious regiment but as a non-commissioned officer in the Royal Military Police. Morse's snobbery is intellectual rather than a question of breeding or social advantage.
Detective Inspector Lynley is another truly aristocratic member of the Police, being an Earl. Much of the plot of the novels by Elizabeth George revolve around his working relationship with Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, who is of lower-class origins. Both show greater loyalty to each other than to official regulations and accepted attitudes to their relative stations, and both are capable of self-sacrificing actions of "noblesse oblige".
Carmen Isabella Sandiego, the "The World's Greatest Thief", was originally ACME Crimenet's most intelligent and distinguished "gentleman detective" with a flawless record in solved cases. She got so bored, she changed careers as a "gentleman thief" and became spymaster and CEO of V.I.L.E., all just for the challenge.
Professor Layton from the video game series named after him.
Detective Inspector Alexandra "Alex" Drake (née Price), the well-bred, posh protagonist of "Ashes to Ashes" (2007-2009, mentioned in "Life on Mars" in 2006).

Koisuru Velfarre Dance (Saturday Night)

"Koisuru Velfarre Dance ~Saturday night~" is MAX's debut single released under Avex Trax. It is a Japanese language cover of the song "Saturday Night" released in 1994 by Whigfield. As the song was originally recorded for the opening of Avex's Velfarre club, it was meant to be MAX's only release as the group was created solely for promoting the club. However, following the official demise of their original group Super Monkey's, the group released another single "Kiss Me Kiss Me, Baby" beginning their reign as one of Japan's most successful and enduring girl groups.
Overview.
MAX's version of "Saturday Night" although a cover, is not a direct translation of the original Whigfield version. Besides new lyrics, MAX's version contains an entirely new comedic spoken word verse. The "Nite Mix" version that appears as a b-side on the single is closer to the original Whigfield version, although it is sped up. A music video for the song was filmed in the Velfarre night club and features MAX and club-goers performing the same dance routine popularized by Whigfield.

Esperient Creator is an interactive 3D application authoring tool for the creation of visual computing applications including video games, simulations, real-time interactive presentations and 3D user interfaces for either standalone or web based delivery.
The software user interface is based on a ‘What You See Is What You Get’ (WYSIWYG) editor interface and supporting specialist editors for animation and scripting of scenes, objects and media in real-time. Creator applications can communicate with 3rd party applications through ActiveX/COM interface or a TCP/IP port. Creator authored scenes can be distributed as executable applications or .esp files viewed with a freely distributable viewer.
The engine behind Esperient Creator is based on DirectX 9.0c, and includes support for the advanced pixel and vertex shader effects.
History.
Esperient Creator was originally called Cosmos Creator and developed as a game authoring tool by Radish Works Inc in 2003, a 3D games software development company established by Michael Bailey, the President of Esperient. All rights to the Cosmos Creator were acquired by Right Hemisphere Inc in 2004 and the product was renamed Deep Creator.
After making the acquisition, Right Hemisphere's core business evolved to focus on Enterprise sales of their core Deep Server platform and 'Creator' was sold as part of an interactive training solution to fortune 1000 companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. While 'Creator' proved to be a valuable tool for Enterprise customers it was never actively marketed as a standalone product for creative media solutions or the visual computing market that lie outside of Right Hemisphere’s core business areas. As a result it has been described as one of the best kept secrets in 3D.
The Esperient Corporation was founded by the development team of Deep Creator in October 2007 to acquire and then continue the development of "Creator", then owned by Right Hemisphere Inc. In April 2008, Esperient signed an Asset Purchase Agreement with RHI to acquire 'Creator' and all associated assets subject to Esperient being able to arrange the necessary funding.
In May 2008, Esperient Creator 3.0 was launched and is now used by seven of the top ten aerospace and defense manufacturers including Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and United Technologies. The company’s products are also used by leading design agencies including Animation Research, Armstrong White, Pixel Graphics, Speedshape and Sonalyst Studios.

Little Seneca Creek

Little Seneca Creek is an stream in Montgomery County, Maryland, roughly northwest of Washington, D.C. The creek drains portions of Clarksburg, Germantown, and Boyds. It rises south of Damascus and flows southward about to Little Seneca Lake, a reservoir created by construction of a dam on the creek. The reservoir empties to the lower portion of the creek, which flows south about to Seneca Creek, which drains to the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay.
A portion of the creek below the lake is a cold water stream that supports natural rainbow trout and brown trout populations.
Water quality issues.
In 1994, the Montgomery County Council anticipated population growth in the Little Seneca watershed and imposed some restrictions on housing development and other new construction in part of the watershed, in order to preserve water quality before development accelerated. A "Special Protection Area" was designated that requires additional controls for stormwater runoff, beyond those required of all new projects.
However, the county reported that its recent requirements for new construction projects have not been sufficient to prevent water quality impairment. Several large land development projects were constructed in Clarksburg and elsewhere in the watershed over the past several years. The county conducted biological monitoring of stream conditions and has documented declines in water quality associated with the new construction. More comprehensive site designs to minimize stormwater runoff, such as conservation design or low impact development designs, are recommended.

SM U-16 (Austria-Hungary)

SM "U-16 or U-XVI" was a or U-boat of the Austro-Hungarian Navy () during World War I. "U-16" was constructed in Germany and shipped by rail to Pula where she was assembled and completed in September 1915. She was commissioned in October 1915.
For most of her career, "U-16" operated in the Adriatic out of Kotor patrolling off the Albanian coast. The U-boat sank one small sailing ship in November and seized another in December. "U-16" carried Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an observer while performing diving tests after engine repairs in January 1916. A water leak in March flooded "U-16"s batteries and put the U-boat out of action for about six weeks of repairs. While operating off Vlorë in mid-October 1916, "U-16" sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort. "U-16" was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources are not clear on the exact cause of her sinking. In all "U-16" sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 711. She was the only "U-10"-class submarine sunk during the war.
Design and construction.
"U-16" was a small, coastal submarine that displaced surfaced and submerged. She featured a single shaft, a single Daimler diesel engine for surface running, and a single electric motor for submerged travel. "U-16" was capable of up to while surfaced and while submerged at a diving depth of up to . She was designed for a crew of 17 officers and men.
"U-16" was equipped with two torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. Although most members of the class were outfitted with a 37 mm/23 (1.5 in) quick-firing (QF) gun to supplement their armament in October 1916, it is not known whether this upgrade had yet taken place on "U-16" by the time of her sinking during that month.
"U-16" was ordered by the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1915 and laid down at AG Weser in Bremen on later in the month. When completed, the submarine was broken down into sections, loaded onto railcars, and shipped on 20 August to the Austro-Hungarian Navy's main base at Pula. After completing the eight-day journey, the sections were riveted together. Though there is no specific mention of how long it took for "U-16"s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine "UB-3", shipped to Pula from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks. "U-16" was delivered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 29 September.
Operational history.
SM "U-16" was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 6 October under the command of "Linienschiffsleutnant" Eugen Hornyák Edler von Horn. Over the next month "U-16" patrolled off Rimini and the Po estuary before heading to Kotor. There, "U-16"s second commander, "Linienschiffsleutnant" Orest Ritter von Zopa, assumed command on 18 November. The U-boat departed the next day to patrol off Albania. Near Cape Rodoni, von Zopa stopped and boarded "Fiore Albania", an Albanian sailing ship. Finding nothing amiss, the commander sent "Fiore Albania" on her way. Three days later, von Zopa and "U-16" scored their first success, when they sank the Italian sailing vessel "Unione" in the Gulf of Drin. Later the same day, a torpedo attack on two cargo ships in the harbor at Shëngjin netted no results. With her supply of torpedoes expended, "U-16" returned to Kotor on 24 November.
"U-16" set out on her next patrol on 3 December, but had to return to fix a broken gyrocompass, and was underway for Albania the next day. On 5 December, the sailboat "Xephanie" was stopped, searched, and allowed to proceed. Near the same location, "U-16" next encountered "Fione Albania" again. When stopped this time, the 62-ton ship had Montenegrin soldiers, weapons, and ammunition aboard. The vessel was seized as a prize and taken back to Kotor. "U-16" attempted two more Albanian patrols at the end of December. The first, departing Kotor on 19 December, was cut short by severe weather that forced the submarine back to port. The next attempt, on 25 December, ended when "U-16" suffered engine problems. "U-16" sailed for Pula on 27 December for more extensive engine repairs at the naval base there.
"U-16"s repairs were complete by 9 January 1916 when the submarine departed Pula for diving tests with Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro-Hungarian Army on board as an observer. With the tests apparently successful, "U-16" returned to Kotor on 18 January to resume Albanian patrols. Off Durrës on 4 February, von Zopa and "U-16" launched a torpedo attack on the steamer "Assyria" being escorted by the Italian destroyers and . The torpedo's aim was true, but it failed to detonate when it hit the ship. A few days later, a British "Falmouth"-class cruiser attacked the U-boat. On 11 March, a valve on "U-16" leaked and water flooded into the boat, inundating the batteries, which released chlorine gas. The U-boat made it back to Kotor and underwent repairs that kept the boat out of action until the end of April.
From late April to early September, "U-16" patrolled the Adriatic between Vlorë, Brindisi, and the Straits of Otranto. Twice during this time "U-16" attacked French destroyers, but missed on both attempts. In mid June, von Zopa launched torpedoes against a cargo ship without result. "U-16" put in at Kotor on 3 September for a general overhaul that lasted for about a month. When the repairs were complete, "U-16" set out for another Albanian patrol on 9 October. The submarine made a detour to Djenovic on 11 October to replace another faulty gyrocompass, but quickly resumed her journey to the Vlorë area. After discovering an Italian convoy on 17 October, von Zopa torpedoed and sank one of the convoy escorts, the . In the ensuing action, "U-16" was sunk, but sources disagree on the exact manner.
"Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921" reports that the Italian steamer , one of the convoyed ships, rammed and damaged "U-16", causing "U-16"s crew to scuttle their ship due to the severity of the damage. Uboat.net's "U-Boat War in World War I" reports that "Nembo" herself rammed "U-16" before going down, while Robert Grant and Gordon Smith give another possible fate for "U-16": that "Nembo"s depth charges detonated and sank the submarine while "Nembo" was sinking. Smith reports that 11 men aboard "U-16", including her commanding officer von Zopa, lost their lives in the sinking, and that two survivors were picked up. "U-16" was the only boat of her class to be sunk during the war.

BL 5 inch gun Mk I – V

The BL 5 inch guns Mk I - Mk V were early British 5-inch breechloading naval guns after it switched from muzzle-loaders in the late 1870s. They were originally designed to use the old gunpowder propellants. The 5-inch calibre was soon discontinued in favour of QF 4.7-inch.
Naval service.
Guns equipped the following British warships :
These guns also equipped several small gunboats of Colonial navies of Australia in the 1880s in response to the perceived threat of Russian expansionism in the Pacific (The "Russian scares").
<br style="clear:left;" >
Second Boer War (1899 - 1902) field gun.
A number of guns mounted on carriages from obsolete RML 40 pounder guns accompanied the British siege train (heavy artillery) to South Africa. They were not required for the expected siege of Pretoria, which did not eventuate. Its usefulness in the field was limited by lack of a recoil control system, and the QF 4.7 inch gun was the most commonly used British heavy gun in the war.
Coast defence gun.
The gun was installed as a conventional coast defence gun in South Africa and Australia, and several in the United Kingdom. Its more common use ashore in the UK was as "moveable armaments" in forts : on 2-wheeled carriages similar to field carriages but intended only for moving short distances to position guns for defence of the fort. These used either obsolete 40-pounder RML carriages or special high-mounting carriages for firing over parapets with recoil controlled by a hydraulic buffer built into the platform to which the carriage was fastened.

Montefiore Windmill

The Montefiore Windmill (less-commonly known as the Jaffa Gate Mill) is a landmark windmill in Jerusalem, Israel. Built in the Mishkenot Sha'ananim neighborhood in 1857, which was then in Ottoman-ruled Palestine, it was designed as a flour mill. The windmill serves as a small museum honored and dedicated to the achievements of British Jewish banker and philanthropist Moses Montefiore. It was restored in 2012 with a new cap and sails in the style of the originals. The mill can turn in the wind.
History.
The windmill was funded by the British Jewish banker and philanthropist Moses Montefiore, who devoted his life to promoting industry, education and health in the Holy Land. Montefiore built the windmill with funding from the estate of an American Jew, Judah Touro, who appointed Montefiore executor of his will. Montefiore mentions the windmill in his diaries (1875), noting that he had built it 18 years ago on the estate of "Kerem-Moshe-ve-Yehoodit", and that it had since been joined by two other windmills nearby, owned by Greeks. The project, bearing the hallmarks of nineteenth century artisan revival, aimed to promote productive enterprise in the Yishuv. 
The mill was designed by Messrs Holman Brothers, the Canterbury, Kent millwrights. The stone for the tower was quarried locally. The tower walls were thick at the base and almost high. Parts were shipped to Jaffa, where there were no suitable facilities for landing the heavy machinery. Transport of the machinery to Jerusalem had to be carried out by camel. In its original form, the mill had a Kentish-style cap and four Patent sails. It was turned to face into the wind by a fantail. The mill drove two pairs of millstones, flour dressers, wheat cleaners and other machinery.
The construction of the mill was part of a broader program to enable the Jews of Palestine to become self-supporting. Montefiore also built a printing press and a textile factory, and helped to finance several agricultural colonies. He attempted to acquire land for Jewish cultivation, but was hampered by Ottoman restrictions on land sale to non-Muslims.
The mill was not a success due to a lack of wind. Wind conditions in Jerusalem could not guarantee its continued operation. There were probably no more than 20 days a year with strong enough breezes. Another reason for the mill's failure was technological. The machinery was designed for soft European wheat, which required less wind power than the local wheat. The first steam-powered mill was built in Jerusalem in 1878.
The Montefiore windmill was phased out by 1891 but restored in 2012.
Anecdotes.
Two anecdotes about the windmill appear in a 1933 book, which refers to it as the "Jaffa Gate Mill." The first is that there was much opposition from among the local millers to the windmill, who looked upon it with the evil eye and sent their head man to curse it. Predictions were made that the mill would be washed away during the rainy season; after it survived intact, it was declared to be the work of Satan. The second is that the Arabs developed a taste for the lubricating oil on the bearings and would lick them, prompting fear the mill would burn down from the resulting friction. The solution was said to be placing a leg of pork in the oil barrel, whereafter the Arabs lost a taste for the oil.
1948 War of Independence.
During the Israeli War of Independence the windmill served an observation point for Jewish fighters. In an attempt to impede the Israeli defence, the British authorities blew up the top of the windmill in an operation dubbed "Operation Don Quixote."
Montefiore carriage.
In a glassed-in room at the windmill is a replica of the carriage Sir Montefiore used in his travels. The original carriage was brought to Palestine by Boris Schatz, the founder of the Bezalel Academy of Art, but it was destroyed in a fire in 1986.
Restoration.
The mill was restored in 2012 as part of the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the founding of Israel. A Dutch organisation, "Christians for Israel" (), is behind the scheme. A model of Stelling Minnis windmill, built by Tom Holman, was temporarily taken to the Netherlands to help raise funds for the restoration. None of the original machinery survives. Millwright Willem Dijkstra rebuilt the floors, sails, cap and machinery in his workshop in Sloten, the Netherlands in cooperation with Dutch construction company Lont and British millwright Vincent Pargeter. The windshaft was cast and machined at Sanders’ IJzergieterij en Machinefabriek B.V in Goor, the Netherlands. The parts were then shipped to Israel and reassembled on site. Dijkstra, his family and employee temporarily moved to Israel to help with the restoration. The cap and sails were lifted into place on July 25, 2012, and the mill was turning for the first time again on August 6.

Dick Liddil

James Andrew "Dick" Liddil (September 15, 1852 – July 13, 1901) was an American outlaw who was one of the last surviving members of the James-Younger Gang. Liddil is the name that appears on his tombstone, but his surname is often misspelled as Liddel, Liddell, or Liddle.
Early years.
Dick Liddil was born to James Milton Liddil and Elizabeth Forsby in Jackson County, Missouri in 1852. In the mid-1870s, Liddil was arrested for horse stealing in Vernon County, Missouri.
James Gang.
After being pardoned by the Governor of Missouri, Liddil was introduced to Jesse James in 1879. Liddil joined the James Gang that year and was later described by Frank James as a "good industrious young chap."
Liddil rode with the James Gang in October 1879 when they raided a depot in Glendale, 15 miles east of Kansas City. After capturing the telegraph operator, the gang signaled a train to stop, stealing the money from the safe in the express car. Liddil later said he received slightly over $1,000 for his part in the raid.
According to Liddil's later account, he became engaged to Mattie Collins the day after the Glendale raid. Liddil had met Collins in 1878 while she was on trial for murdering her employer. After Collins was acquitted on grounds of emotional insanity, Liddil introduced himself.
By some accounts, Liddil served as the lookout in September 1880 when the James Gang robbed the John Dovey Coal Mine payroll in Mercer County, Kentucky. Liddil reportedly had a love of horses and attended the horse races with Jesse James at Nashville's Blood Horse Race Course in October 1880.
Liddil was also part of the James Gang during its 1881 robberies of a paymaster delivering money to workers on the Muscle Shoals Canal project in Alabama, and a July 1881 robbery of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad at Winston, Missouri.
In November 1881, Liddil and Wood Hite, a first cousin of the James brothers, became engaged in a shootout outside Adairville, Kentucky, though neither man was shot. Liddil and Bob Ford killed Hite later that year, and Liddil was wounded in the fight. After killing Hite, Liddil hid, worrying that Jesse James would seek revenge for the death of his cousin. Liddil later recalled, “I mistrusted and believed Jesse wanted to kill me.”
In January 1882, Liddil and Robert Ford surrendered to Sheriff James Timberlake at Martha Bolton's residence in Clay County, Missouri, reportedly out of fear of what Jesse James would do to him for killing Hite. Liddil told the law what he knew about the criminal activities of the James Gang, and his capture and confession were kept secret until March 1882.
Shortly after Liddil turned himself in, Jesse James was shot by Bob Ford in April 1882. That summer, Liddil was taken to Alabama where he stood trial for the Muscle Shoals robbery. He was found guilty but pardoned, as part of a deal requiring him to testify against Frank James. Despite Liddil's testimony, Frank James was acquitted, reportedly because the jury concluded that Liddil, who had turned on his associates, was not a reliable witness.
Later years.
Liddil co-owned the Bank Saloon with Bob Ford in Las Vegas, New Mexico during the mid-1880s, and later leased the saloon/billiard room at the Las Vegas Plaza Hotel. Liddil returned to Missouri in the 1890s and became a regular on the Midwest racehorse circuit. Liddil worked as a horse trainer at Kentucky's Newport Park from 1896-1901. In 1901, the "Cincinnati Post" reported that Liddil owned several of the area's finest thoroughbreds and was one of the best-known horsemen in the West.
In April 1891, Liddil was arrested for the murder of Wood Hite. The "New York Times" reported on the arrest as follows:"Dick Liddell, once a member of the famous James gang, now a wealthy horse owner on the Eastern tracks, was arrested and lodged in jail at Richmond yesterday. He is charged with the murder of Wood Hite, a cousin of Jesse James. The crime was committed in 1882 and was the outgrowth of a feud existing among several members of the gang. When the James gang was broken up, Liddell came East and raced horses at Brighton Beach, Clifton and Guttenberg."
Liddil died of a heart heart attack three months later while attending the Queen City Races at the race track in Latonia, Kentucky, a suburb of Cincinnati, on July 13, 1901.
Cultural references.
Liddil has been a character in several motion pictures on the James-Younger Gang.

Junos

Juniper Junos is the FreeBSD-based operating system used in Juniper Networks hardware routers. It is an operating system that is used in Juniper's routing, switching and security devices. Juniper offers a Software Development Kit (SDK) to partners and customers to allow additional customization. The biggest competitor of Junos is Cisco Systems's IOS.
Versioning.
Junos provides a single code base across most of Juniper's platforms. Juniper has issued a new release of Junos every 90 days since 1998.
Architecture.
Junos operating system is primarily based on the FreeBSD, an advantage of which is the Unix-like environment: customers can access a Unix shell and execute normal Unix commands. Junos is platform independent within Juniper hardware systems. After Juniper acquired NetScreen, it also integrated ScreenOS security functions into its own Junos network operating system so that now Juniper offers routing and security functions in a single device.
Junos Command Line Interface (CLI).
The Junos CLI is a text-based command interface for configuring, troubleshooting, and monitoring the Juniper device and network traffic associated with it. It supports two types of command modes.
The functions of "Operational Mode" include control of the CLI environment, monitoring of hardware status, and display of information about network data that passes though or into the hardware. The "Configuration mode" is used for configuring the Juniper router, switch, or security device, by adding, deleting, or modifying statements in the configuration hierarchy.
Junos SDK.
Through the Juniper Developer Network (JDN) Juniper Networks provides the Junos SDK to its customers and 3rd-party developers who want to develop applications for Junos-powered devices such as Juniper Networks routers, switches, and service gateway systems. It provides a set of tools and application programming interfaces (APIs), including interfaces to Junos routing, firewall filter, UI and traffic services functions. Juniper Networks also employs the Junos SDK internally to develop parts of Junos and many Junos applications such as OpenFlow for Junos, and other traffic services.
Market share.
Juniper as of June 13, 2008 has 5 percent of the $4.2 billion enterprise-router market, 18 percent of the $4.7 billion service-provider edge-router market and 30 percent of the $2.7 billion service-provider core-router market, according to the Dell'Oro Group.

Despite the losing record, the groundwork was laid for the Saints to shed their image as perennial doormats. On January 14, owner Tom Benson hired Jim Finks as the franchise's general manager, and turned over the entire football operation to the veteran operative who previously built championship clubs with the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears.

19th Golden Melody Awards

Ceremonies of the 19th Golden Melody Awards () were held in Taipei, Taiwan in 2008. Nominees were announced on May 22, 2008, and the award winners in 12 traditional music categories (of 47 nominees) and 23 popular music categories (of 124 nominees) were selected by a panel of 33 judges after four rounds of jury meetings. Initially, there were 10,632 submissions from 185 companies in the music industry, making it the largest submission pool in the Awards' history.
Winners for artistic and traditional music categories were announced on June 21, 2008 at Taipei County Hall in a ceremony separate from that for popular music categories. It was the second consecutive year that the ceremony for this category group was held separately, and it did not attract as much media attention as the ceremony for the popular music categories. By contrast, artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and Canada attended the awards ceremony for popular music categories, which was held at the Taipei Arena on July 5, 2008. Actress sisters Barbie and Dee Hsu, former news anchor Patty Hou, and actress Matilda Tao hosted this event, whose list of award presenters included Canadian recording artist Daniel Powter and Japanese drama stars Akito Kiriyama, Junta Nakama, and Yuya Takaki. Both events were broadcast on the satellite cable Azio Television channel on June 28 and July 5, respectively.
Malaysian singer Gary Chaw and Singaporean singer-songwriter Tanya Chua were named Best Mandarin Male and Female Singers in the popular music category, respectively. Chua won the Best Mandarin Female Singer award for the second time; she last won the award in the 17th Golden Melody Awards. Chua's record seven nominations for her album "Goodbye & Hello" are the most received by a female artist. Taiwanese musician and singer Jay Chou, who received a record-breaking eight nominations for his album "On the Run" and film "Secret", was not able to attend the event due to his tour in China. Chou's primary lyricist Vincent Fang was present to receive the award of Best Lyricist for the song "Blue and White Porcelain" (). Pop rock band Sodagreen received its second consecutive award as Best Band for its album "Incomparable Beauty".

Daniel Tarantola

Daniel Tarantola was born in Ajaccio (Corsica), France, in 1942. Having obtained his medical degree from Paris University, Daniel began an international health career in 1971 in the context of emergency humanitarian medical missions to Biafra (Nigeria), and Peru. He was engaged in a movement with Bernard Kouchner which resulted in the foundation of Médecins Sans Frontières, of which he was the first physician working in the field (1973, Burkina Faso). Early in his career, Daniel worked over almost two decades with the World Health Organization on large scale international health programmes, including the eradication of smallpox from Bangladesh (1974–1978), childhood disease control programmes (1979–1984), the Expanded Programme on Immunization, the Control of Diarrhoeal Diseases Programme, the Acute Respiratory Infections Programme and as a senior member of the team who designed and started the launching of the WHO Global programme on HIV/AIDS (1987–1990). 
Having left WHO in 1991, Daniel was over a period of eight years a Lecturer in the Department of Population and International Health of the Harvard School of Public Health and a Senior Associate of the Harvard-based François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights. With Jonathan Mann, with whom he was closely associated over a period of twelve years, he co-authored and co-edited a number of publications including two volumes of AIDS in the World, in 1992 and 1996, respectively. While Mann is the person most associated with the movement that seeks to integrate public health and human rights by conceptualizing them as interdependent, it is fair to say that in a less public manner Tarantola played (and continues to play) an equally key role in working to establish 'health and human rights' as integral to the on-the-ground work of IGOs, states, and NGOs. 
From 1998-2004, Daniel rejoined the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva as a Senior Policy Adviser to the Director General with a specific focus on health and human rights, HIV/AIDS and communicable diseases, and family health. Additionally during the latter part of this period, Daniel occupied the function of Director of the WHO Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals.
In 2005, upon retiring from the WHO, Daniel took up a professorship at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, leading a cross-Faculty research initiative on Health and Human Rights involving the Faculties of Medicine, Law and Arts and Social Sciences. In 2010, Daniel relocated to his own country, France. His current work aims at exploring the interface and synergies between health, development and human rights as they relate, among other topics, to: HIV, Hepatitis C, poverty and human development, climate change, indigenous populations, migration, refugees and post-disaster impact mitigation. He continues to be very active in the field of immunization for which he chairs a number of programme evaluations and strategic planning.

Charles (Chuck) Arnett

Charles (Chuck) Arnett (1928–1988), American artist and dancer, was born on February 15, 1928 in Bogalusa, Louisiana.
He grew up there and in New Orleans, which he would later always claim as his hometown, and danced in the local Ballet successfully for several seasons before moving to New York City in 1951 to better pursue the career he wanted to make for himself in the world of professional Dance.
Arriving with letters of introduction and names of people to contact from his time as a dancer in New Orleans, he quickly settled into the life a traditional class on Manhattan who were proud to refer to themselves as "theatrical gypsies." His next few years his time was divided between the best dance classes he could get enrolled into, practice, auditioning for parts, and (if lucky) rehearsing and then performing on the stage.
The closest thing he would ever experience to knowing what it is like to suddenly be discovered and recognized for his talent and abilities was the day when he went to audition to dance with the National Ballet of Canada. That he was willing to move from Manhattan to relocated in the Canadian Provincial capital of Toronto, Ontario is a good indication of how important this job was to Arnett. The time he spent with the National Ballet was the only full time, permanent employment he would ever hold in his life.
Chuck Arnett was an American artist who worked in a variety of media. His best known work is the Tool Box Mural (1962).
Chuck did some dancing in Las Vegas casinos. He moved to San Francisco where he worked basically in a managerial job at The Tool Box, one of the first "Leather Bars" a gay bar frequented by gay motorcycle clubs. One busy night Rudolf Nureyev came in with several men obviously from the opera house where Rudy was performing. He was seated at the bar and with all eyes upon him, removed the coat he had on, revealing a leather jacket considerable applause. Chuck, who had rushed to serve his idol, brought his drink, a cognac, in the best glass the house could provide, and when he finished it and left, Arnett grabbed that goblet like the holy grail, a prized trophy!

"The name derives from the long-standing tradition of playing the 1985 movie Teen Wolf at BNAT, only to have the film burn or be destroyed before any significant portion is screened. Tim League, founder and CEO of the Alamo Drafthouse told Jeff Mahler (a longtime BNAT attendee whose love for Teen Wolf inspired its unsuccessful inclusion in the festival each year) that the film would be screened at BNAT13WOLF, but that due to scheduling demands the pristine 35mm print film they had found had to be cut into "literally thousands of pieces" and edited into the program whenever time was available. Clips that highlighted the entirety of "Teen Wolf" were then inserted into the sequences of themed trailers that preceded all of the feature films. The actual clips were in extremely small segments of less than two seconds each. Most often they were only a few frames in length - a hilarious image from the movie popping up and disappearing in a flash.

The Armada (band)

The Armada was a three-piece rock band based in Cork, Ireland. Fronted by Jeff Martin of The Tea Party, "The Armada" aimed to encompass the tone of The Tea Party, while moving it forward.
The band was formed when Jeff Martin and Wayne Sheehy met in an Irish Pub. The two hit it off immediately and soon started making music together.
The name of the band refers to the Spanish Armada: "We were like, what is this?" Martin said. "It's massive, but what do we make of this?"
That's when Sheehy commented, "It's kind of like the Spanish Armada . . . attacking you from all fronts."
On September 27, 2008, Gareth Forsyth was announced as the bassist/keyboardist through the band's MySpace.
Their debut album "The Armada", was released through the Kingdom Records website on November 4, 2008.

Elementary School Musical (South Park)

"Elementary School Musical" is the thirteenth episode of the twelfth season of the animated series "South Park", and the 180th episode of the series overall. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 12, 2008. In the episode, a new boy at school helps set off an impromptu-singing-and-dancing craze that the boys vow to never go along with, dragging them down into the dregs of unpopularity.
The episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode is a parody of the "High School Musical" film series.
Plot.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny realize that, apart from them, everyone at school has bought into the newest fad, the "High School Musical" film series. The four boys repeatedly witness the rest of South Park Elementary collectively break into song, in the spirit of the musical films. Unaware of what "High School Musical" is, the boys watch one of the films, but dislike it, and vow never to become a part of this fad. Cartman decides to commit suicide by inducing carbon monoxide poisoning while sleeping under his mother's car (with the engine turned on) but it fails since hybrid cars do not "do the trick anymore".
Stan fears that Wendy is becoming close with a popular third-grader named Bridon Gueermo (voiced by Parker), because they tend to share lead roles in the musical routines. Stan talks to Bridon in hopes of directing him away from Wendy, and finds out Bridon would prefer to play basketball instead of singing. It is revealed that the reason that Bridon made up the fad because of his theater-crazed, flamboyant metrosexual father (also voiced by Parker) forces him to do it. Stan pressures him to try out with the basketball team anyway. Although Mr. Gueermo stops Bridon's attempts at playing basketball multiple times, Bridon eventually stands up for himself, and joins the team.
Meanwhile, unhappy at becoming an outcast in school, Stan decides to join the trend and studies the "High School Musical" series intensively, despite having vowed against it. He convinces Kyle, Cartman and Kenny that the world has changed, and they cannot go against the tide anymore. The next day at school, the four boys perform a song along with an equally elaborate dance routine about the importance of following one's dreams. However, upon learning that Bridon has joined the basketball team, everyone else is uninterested and leaves during the boys' performance to watch Bridon play basketball instead. The four kids learn that the rest of the school just liked Bridon for his looks and charisma and not the fad itself.
Reception.
Travis Fickett of IGN commented that the episode "doesn't make as much of the idea as it could" and rated the episode at 7.5 out of 10. 411mania's DC Perry rated it at 7.4 out of 10 compared it favorably to other episodes of the season, but wrote that "eing one of the best episodes of this season isn't really an accomplishment ... It just feels like they're running out of ideas." Sean O'Neal of "The A.V. Club" gave the episode a 'B+' rating, describing it as a "silly-smart episode that nevertheless ranks as one of the standouts from what's proven to be a very hit-or-miss season".

The Film and Video Arts Society (FAVA) provides training, equipment, and networking opportunities for emerging and established filmmakers. Established by independent artists in 1982, FAVA represents one of the oldest artist-run co-ops in Canada and reached its 25th anniversary milestone in 2008. The Society operates out of one of Edmonton, Alberta's historic buildings: the Ortona Armoury, built in 1914 by the Hudson's Bay Company and originally used as a stable. FAVA's successful model is now copied by other non-profit cooperatives; having grown from 16 initial members to today's more than 300. Early years of meager supplies and limited resources helped to nurture a communal sense of sharing and a pooling of equipment that extended even to the National Film Board of Canada who shared office space and an infamous "late-night key" (that provided access to a bounty of top-line equipment) with FAVA in the Ortona Armoury.

Benjamin Johnson Lang

Benjamin Johnson Lang (December 28, 1837April 3, 1909) was an American conductor, pianist, organist, teacher and composer. He introduced a large amount of music to American audiences, including the world premiere of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1, which he conducted in Boston in 1875.
Biography.
Benjamin Johnson Lang was born in Salem, Massachusetts, the son of a piano maker, music teacher and organist. By the age of 12 he was showing sufficient promise as a pianist to play Chopin's Ballade No. 3 in A flat. He began organ lessons at 12, and by 18 he was the organist of the largest instrument in Boston, the First Baptist Church on Somerset Street. He excelled in improvisation. In 1852, he took over his father’s organ teaching business. In 1855 he went to Europe to study in Berlin and elsewhere. He studied mainly under Alfred Jaëll, but also had some instruction from Franz Liszt. He had a lasting friendship with both Liszt and his daughter Cosima. He made his first public appearance as a pianist 1858, in Boston, where he spent the remainder of his life. That year he played the piano in the first Boston performance of Beethoven's Piano Trio in C minor, Op. 1, No. 3, with the Mendelssohn Quintette Club. From 1860 to 1870, Lang built a piano and organ teaching career of great success; he was considered a very thorough teacher and his pupils included Arthur Foote, Ethelbert Nevin, William F. Apthorp, and own children, Margaret and Malcolm. His debut as a conductor was on May 3, 1862, when he gave Boston's first performance with orchestra of Mendelssohn's "Die erste Walpurgisnacht", which he presented twice in the same concert. 
Louis Moreau Gottschalk was so impressed with Lang's piano playing that he hired him as a collaborator for a series of twenty concerts in which compositions for two pianos were featured.
On January 1, 1863, along with Carl Zerrahn, he conducted the jubilee concert in honour of Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. The concert was attended by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who read one of his poems. From then on he appeared in public more often as a conductor than as a pianist. He was the founding conductor the Apollo Club, a men's singing society, from 1871 to 1901. He was also the conductor of Caecilia, a mixed voice choir, and of the Handel and Haydn Society from 1895 to 97.
Lang visited Richard Wagner (who was now married to Liszt's daughter Cosima) at Tribschen and Bayreuth in 1871 and offered his assistance in publicizing the Bayreuth Festival in America. In 1876 he and his wife were honored guests at the first performance of the Ring Cycle in Bayreuth. He later introduced many of Wagner’s works to America. 
He is perhaps best remembered now for being the conductor of the world premiere of the original version of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, with Hans von Bülow (Cosima's former husband) as soloist, on October 25, 1875. Bülow had initially engaged a different conductor, but quarrelled with him, and Lang was brought in at short notice. George Whitefield Chadwick, who attended the performance, recalled in a memoir years later: "They had not rehearsed much and the trombones got in wrong in the ‘tutti’ in the middle of the first movement, whereupon Bülow sang out in a perfectly audible voice, "The brass may go to hell"". Lang himself appeared as soloist in a performance of the concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra on February 20, 1885.
Other first performances he conducted were:
With his experience and credentials, it surprised many that Lang was not named conductor of the newly formed Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO). However, Lang appeared as a pianist in twelve concerts during the first years of the orchestra. On December 9, 1876 he was the soloist in the first U.S. performance of Saint-Saëns' Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor with Leopold Damrosch conducting. With the Harvard Musical Association, he played "all the great concertos, many of them for the first time in Boston".
In 1888 Lang became organist of King's Chapel, and remained there until his death in 1909. It was Lang who in 1888 encouraged Edward MacDowell to resettle in Boston, then the centre of concert life in America. The Lang home entertained prominent guests such as Antonín Dvořák and Ignacy Jan Paderewski.
In 1891, at great personal expense he brought the entire New York Metropolitan Opera House Orchestra to Boston to present the first performance in Boston of Wagner's "Parsifal", conducted by Anton Seidl, who had assisted Wagner in the first complete performance of the Ring in 1876 and who in 1889 he led the first complete Ring in America.
His compositions included symphonies, overtures, an oratorio "David", chamber pieces, piano pieces and songs. Most of these were performed, however the only published work was by Chadwick who used a "melodic motive" of Lang's in the first of his "Drei Walzer fur das Pianoforte." He destroyed all his other manuscripts. In 1903, Yale University conferred on him the degree of Master of Arts.
His last appearance as a conductor was on February 12, 1909, when he conducted the BSO and a chorus for a commemoration of the centenary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln. He presented Mendelssohn’s Symphony No. 2 "Hymn of Praise", which he had also conducted at the Emancipation Jubilee concert in 1862. He died only a few weeks later, on April 3. His estate was valued at over $600,000, an enormous amount for that time. His bequests included a silver box containing Liszt's hair, which he left to his daughter Margaret.
Family life.
In 1861 he married Frances Morse Burrage (1839–1934). Although she never became a professional, she was well regarded as a singer. Their three children inherited their musical aptitudes: Margaret Ruthven Lang (1867–1972), a composer; Rosamond (1878–1971), a pianist; and Malcolm (1881–1972), a pianist and organist.
Many of Margaret's works were presented at concerts under her father's baton. Her "Dramatic Overture", Op. 12, was the first work by a woman played by a major American symphony orchestra (BSO, 1893, Arthur Nikisch).

Homecoming Scotland 2009

Homecoming Scotland 2009 was a series of events designed to attract people of Scottish ancestry to visit Scotland. The campaign, organised by EventScotland and VisitScotland on behalf of the Scottish Government, and part-financed by the European Regional Development Fund, claimed that "for every single Scot in their native land, there are thought to be at least five more overseas who can claim Scottish ancestry."
2009 was the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns, the national poet. In addition to Burns-related events, the other four themes of the Homecoming were Scotland's culture and heritage, great Scottish minds and innovations, and golf and whisky.
Calendar of Events.
On 16 June 2008 Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond MSP MP, officially launched Homecoming Scotland 2009 at Edinburgh Castle. The Homecoming started on 25 January 2009 (Burns night) and ran until 30 November 2009 (St Andrews Day).
On 24 July 2009 a Clan Convention, composed of the clan chiefs, clan commanders and leading clan representatives of Scottish clans, met to discuss the "Role of the Clan in the 21st century". The Clan Convention took place within the Scottish Parliament.
The centrepiece event of the year was The Gathering 2009, on 25 and 26 July, centred on Holyrood Park in Edinburgh. The clan gathering included highland games over the two days, a parade up the Royal Mile and a 'clan pageant' on the castle esplanade. 
Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay, is to be Patron of The Gathering 2009.
There was a long list of homecoming events, including several well-established events, e.g. (in date order):
Scottish Cup Sponsorship.
In October 2008, it was announced that the Scottish Cup would be re-branded as "The Homecoming Scottish Cup" for the 2008/09 competition. Glasgow-based businessman Willie Haughey signed a two-year sponsorship deal for the cup, handing the branding rights over to the Scottish Government. A new name was applied to the 2009/10 competition.

2009 Heineken Cup Final

The 2009 Heineken Cup Final was the final match of the 2008–09 Heineken Cup, the 14th season of Europe's top club rugby union competition. The match was played on 23 May 2009 at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh; this was the second time that the Heineken Cup final had been held at Murrayfield after the 2005 final, when Toulouse beat Stade Français 18–12 after extra time.
The match was contested by Leicester Tigers of England and Leinster of Ireland. While Leinster were making their first appearance in the Heineken Cup final, Leicester were playing in their fifth, having won the competition twice, though not since 2002; they did, however, finish as runners-up in 2007. 
Leinster won the match 19–16; Leinster took the lead via an early drop goal from Brian O'Driscoll, only for Julien Dupuy to equalise with a penalty a couple of minutes later. Leinster then moved 9–3 ahead with a drop goal from the halfway line and a penalty from Jonathan Sexton. However, after Stan Wright was sin-binned on the half-hour mark for an off-the-ball challenge on Sam Vesty, Leicester reduced the deficit to three points with another Dupuy penalty, before taking a 13–9 half-time lead via a converted try from Ben Woods. Dupuy increased Leicester's lead to seven points with a third penalty goal just after the interval, but a converted try from Jamie Heaslip brought the teams level with half an hour left to play. Then, with ten minutes left on the clock, Jonathan Sexton squeezed a penalty inside the right-hand upright to win the match for Leinster.
Background.
Murrayfield Stadium was chosen as the venue for the 2009 Heineken Cup Final on 19 May 2008. The 2009 final was the second Heineken Cup final to be hosted by the 67,778-capacity stadium, following the 2005 final, when Toulouse beat Stade Français 18–12 after extra time in front of 51,000 spectators.
The 2009 final was Leinster's first Heineken Cup final, although they had reached the semi-final stage on three other occasions: in 1995–96, 2002–03 and 2005–06, when they were knocked out by Cardiff RFC, Perpignan and Munster respectively. Leicester, however, had reached the final on four other occasions: 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2007; they won the competition in 2001 and 2002, beating Stade Français and Munster, but lost out to Brive in 1997 and London Wasps in 2007.
Nigel Owens of Wales was named as the match referee for the 2009 final on 13 May 2009, making him the second official to referee consecutive Heineken Cup finals after England's Chris White. Frenchman Christophe Berdos was appointed as fourth official.
Route to the final.
Leinster.
For the pool stage draw, the 24 entrants were divided up into four tiers based on their European Rugby Club ranking; each group would consist of one team from each tier, and no country could have more than one team in the same group – with the exception of France, which would have two teams in one group. Leinster was placed in Tier 2, which would mean that they would avoid being drawn with teams like Gloucester, Sale Sharks and the Scarlets, but they could still be drawn with Toulouse, Stade Français, the Ospreys and the Cardiff Blues. They ended up being drawn in Pool 2 alongside London Wasps, Castres and Edinburgh.
Leinster won four of their pool stage matches, but a Matchday 5 defeat to Wasps meant that they had to equal or better the London side's result on the final matchday to be guaranteed a place in the knockout stage as group winners. In the end, Leinster's 12–3 win over Edinburgh was sufficient as Wasps were defeated in Castres and Leinster qualified as the sixth seeds for the quarter-finals, meaning that they would have to play away to third seeds Harlequins in the quarter-finals.
Leinster's quarter-final against Harlequins was the last of the quarter-finals to be played, and also the lowest-scoring: Harlequins responded to two first-half penalties from Felipe Contepomi with a 65th-minute try from Mike Brown; Chris Malone had the chance to give Harlequins the lead, but his conversion attempt went wide of the far post. Brown also missed with a long-range penalty, while an injured Nick Evans, who had come on as a blood replacement under dubious circumstances, sent a last-minute drop goal attempt wide to give Leinster a 6–5 win.
The draw for the semi-finals was also made in January 2009, with the winners of Leinster's quarter-final due to play against either Munster or the Ospreys. Munster came through their quarter-final comfortably, beating the Ospreys 43–9 to set up an all-Irish semi-final. As Heineken Cup holders and newly crowned champions of the Celtic League, Munster went into the game as favourites, but Leinster drew first blood with an early drop goal from fly-half Felipe Contepomi. Ronan O'Gara equalised with a penalty shortly after. Several minutes later, Leinster suffered a major blow when Contepomi went down with what proved to be a cruciate ligament injury. A penalty from Contepomi's replacement, Jonathan Sexton, and an unconverted try from Gordon D'Arcy gave Leinster an 11–3 lead; a second penalty from O'Gara reduced Leinster's half-time lead to 11–6. Another try for Leinster, this time from Luke Fitzgerald, just after the interval put them two scores ahead, before Brian O'Driscoll intercepted a pass from Ronan O'Gara to score under the posts and round off a 25–6 win for Leinster. The match marked the first time that a club rugby match had been played at Croke Park, and the 82,208 attendance for the match set a new world record in club Rugby Union.
Leicester Tigers.
Based on their European Club Rugby ranking, Leicester Tigers were placed in Tier 1 for the pool stage draw, meaning that they would avoid being drawn with Toulouse, Stade Français and holders Munster. They were eventually drawn into Pool 3 with Perpignan, the Ospreys and Benetton Treviso.
Four wins in their first five matches meant that Leicester went into their final pool match against the Ospreys needing only a point to reach the knockout stage. Within 15 minutes of the match kicking off, they were already 6–3 down; the score remained that way until half-time, after which the two teams continued to trade penalties, resulting in a final score of 15–9 to the Ospreys. The six-point margin gave the Tigers the losing bonus point they needed and they qualified for the quarter-finals as pool winners. Their pool record meant that they were given the fourth seed for the quarter-finals, meaning that they would face a home match against the fifth seeds, Bath.
Leicester went into the quarter-finals as the joint-top try scorers from the pool stage, while Bath had the second-lowest number of tries. Nevertheless, it was Bath substitute Shaun Berne who scored the first try of the quarter-final, going 7–6 up after Sam Vesty had scored two penalties in the first quarter of the game. After half-time, the two teams traded penalties before Joe Maddock crossed for Bath's second try in the 64th minute. Vesty levelled the scores at 15–15 soon after, but just as the match looked like it was heading to extra time, Leicester's replacement scrum-half Julien Dupuy feinted to pass back to Vesty in the pocket for a match-winning drop goal before scurrying through a gap at the base of the ruck on the edge of Bath's 22-metre line to score a try. Leicester's 20–15 win secured them a place in the semi-finals, where they would play the Cardiff Blues, who had beaten Toulouse 9–6 earlier that day.
The Blues were the only team to come through the pool stage unbeaten and, going into the quarter-finals, they were the joint-top try scorers in the competition, along with Leicester themselves. Ben Blair gave Cardiff the lead with a penalty before the 15-minute mark, but Leicester responded with a converted try from Scott Hamilton and a Julien Dupuy penalty to take the score to 10–3. Cardiff hit back with three penalties of their own before Dupuy slotted over to give Leicester a 13–12 half-time lead. After half-time, Leicester increased their lead with a converted try from Geordan Murphy and two more penalties from Dupuy; however, only a few minutes later, the Tigers were hit with two quick-fire sin-binnings, and the Blues took full advantage by scoring two converted tries from Jamie Roberts and Tom James to tie the scores at 26–26 and send the game into extra time. Aside from two missed drop goal attempts from Johne Murphy and Aaron Mauger, extra time was largely uneventful and the match went to the first penalty shootout in Heineken Cup history. The first seven kicks in the shootout were all successful, giving Cardiff a 4–3 lead before Johne Murphy stepped up; however, the Irish winger missed the target, giving Tom James a chance to win the shootout for the Blues, only for the Welshman to miss his kick, allowing Scott Hamilton to convert and take the shootout to sudden death. Both teams successfully converted two more kicks before Martyn Williams wildly hooked his attempt wide and Jordan Crane slotted over to send Leicester into the final.
Match.
Leinster beat Leicester 19–16. They led Leicester 9–3 within 30 minutes following drop goals by Brian O'Driscoll and Johnny Sexton and a penalty by Sexton. They then had Stan Wright sin-binned, with Leicester moving into a 13–9 lead at half-time thanks to a Ben Woods try. Leinster's Jamie Heaslip scored a try to level the scores in the second half, with Sexton scoring another penalty to win the match ten minutes before the end.
Reaction.
Ireland's Taoiseach Brian Cowen attended the match and said he was "absolutely delighted" and that it was a "real pleasure" to be present at a "hugely exciting match". He said it had been part of "a golden year" for the sport in Ireland. 
John Gormley, leader of the Irish Green Party, said the team deserved "the country's fullest praise and admiration" for lifting themselves "to the very heights of the international game".
The British media reported in the aftermath that "everything Irish rugby touches at the moment turns to gleaming silver".
The Leinster team were welcomed back at a special ceremony in their regular home ground, the RDS Arena, on 24 May 2009. Spectators did not have to pay to attend this celebration, which also featured live music and family activities.
Leicester were reported to have taken "their considerable disappointment on the chin".

Ercan Akbay

Ercan Akbay is a writer, painter, and musician who was born on 12 February 1959 in Istanbul. He studied finance at a university, and he has worked in many different sectors throughout his life; he now devotes his time to writing and painting. He has written two novels and one collection of stories. He also regularly exhibits his paintings and has two music albums to his name.
Biography.
As a young man he read a lot, admired the contemporary Latin and Anglo-Saxon singer-poets, and started to try composing poetry of his own on a guitar that he taught himself to play in just a few weeks. Ever since then, he has continued to show the same diligence in all three arts that he works with. He describes his music, painting and writing as his means of expressing the piquancy of the adventures he has lived through and the complicated state of his inner world.
He started work the same day he started university. After eventful years in the tourism and electronics sectors, he began to work for himself, and soon learnt to view life as a game from having to do so many different things at the same time: He managed a jazz club; he founded companies in various fields; he got involved in financial markets. He has worked in the stock market, real estate, music and ballet production, old film and record restoration, concert and sound recording and film editing, book cover and poster design, and other fields, and still continues to work in some of them today.
After producing "A Summer's Night", a performance of his spoken and sung poetry telling the story of deep pain and parting, unhealthy passions, death, split personalities and thoughts against the system, all put to music in his own inimitable way in 1989, in 1996 the artist released "Tales of the Weird", an experimental album based on his book of the same name.
Towards the end of 1997, he wrote "Men Don't Cry". Due to a problem with the publishing house he was working with at the time, there was a five-year gap in his life as a writer from 2002. In 2006, he finished his novel "What Time is It Mr Wolf?", which had started life as a TV script. In 2007, he reached an agreement to reprint all of his books.
Just as in his paintings, in all his books the writer has a linguistic and narrative style completely his own.
Paintings.
His expressive works from after 2006 are exhibited regularly at several art galleries of Istanbul. For his artworks you may visit: [http://www.resimsergileri.org]

Eugène Jamot

Eugène Jamot (1879–1937) was a French physician who played a major role in the prevention of sleeping sickness in Cameroun and other African countries.
He was born in the hamlet of La Borie, part of the commune of Saint-Sulpice-les-Champs, in the Creuse "département" of central France. Jamot trained as a medical doctor at the University of Montpellier. In 1909, he enrolled at the Marseilles School of Tropical Medicine and a year later, in 1910 he went to Cameroon with a French colonial hygiene group. They joined German scientists who had organised a Sleeping Sickness Treatment Research Group. Jamot discovered that the tsetse fly was the vector of the trypanosomes causing the disorder. By sending multiple public health intervention teams in villages, Jamot’s team considerably reduced the incidence of trypanosomiasis, and thus, its transmission, in Cameroun and hence the disease.
Later Jamot was made director of the Pasteur Institute at Brazzaville. He died on the 7th April 1937, in the village of Sardent, Creuse.

Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986

Iceland was present at the Eurovision Song Contest 1986, held in Bergen, Norway. It was the first time Iceland was represented in the Contest.
While the country had satellite television contact from other nations (the United States and Canada) since 1981, Iceland was not able to connect to other European nations before the end of 1985, meaning 1986 was the first year Iceland could send a delegation to the Eurovision Song Contest.
The Icelandic national final to select their entry, "Söngvakeppni Sjónvarpsins", was held on the 15th March at the RÚV Studios in Reykjavík, and was hosted by young musician Jónas R. Jónsson. 1985 Eurovision Song Contest winners Bobbysocks were special guests, and they performed their winning song "La det swinge", and a new song entitled "Midnight Rocks" during the show. The votes of a five-member "expert jury" decided the winner, although only the top five placings were announced. 
The winning entry was "Gleðibankinn," performed by Pálmi Gunnarsson and composed by Magnús Eiríksson.
At Eurovision.
Pálmi Gunnarsson performed sixth on the night of the contest, following United Kingdom and preceding the Netherlands. He was joined by Helga Möller and Eiríkur Hauksson, comprising the trio ICY.
At the close of the voting it had received 19 points, placing 16th in a field of 20 competing countries. Iceland's first-ever points were awarded to them by the Netherlands (who gave the song five of the eventual 19 points).

Eco-social market economy

The concept of an Eco-social market economy aims at balancing free market economics, the strive for social fairness and the sustainable use and protection of the natural resources. It was developed by Austrian politician Josef Riegler during the 1980s.
Definition and aims.
The eco-social market economy is a holistic model based on a strong and innovative market economy. The eco-social market economy requires that the protection of the environment and social fairness are vital criteria for all economic activity. The protection of the ecology and habitat for future generations are central issues for eco-social market economies. Its supporters maintain that free markets alone are not able or interested to protect the environment, hence government action is necessary. The creation of higher social and environmental standards, especially in developing countries, is seen as a vital step to world peace in the future.
""The eco-social market economy aims at: higher chances for the brave, more solidarity and more responsibility for natural habitats"" (Josef Riegler) 
Proposed measures.
Frameworks and Guidelines for fair competition must be implemented, not only in the EU, but on a global level. It is a foremost demand to politics to create such a political landscape of global connectivity and cooperation. Eco-social market economists support the implementation of the Millennium Development goals and the Kyoto Protocol, and demand a stronger cooperation between the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund and the International Labour Organisation to create the said framework.
On a national level, it favours higher taxes on fossil-fuel energy sources (environmental taxes), while at the same time lowering income taxes. Public subsidies must, in their opinion, only be paid to promote sustainability. Environmental pollution and resource use must be included in the calculation of product processes and in product prices. A strong emphasis in education about issues on environmental protection are seen as being absolutely necessary to create awareness.market
Global Marshall Plan Initiative.
The idea of a global marshall plan, first brought forward by Al Gore in the 1990s, is a main part of Eco-social thinking. The idea of a Global Marshall Plan is based on two pillars:
""1. Innovative additional fundraising required for the actual realisation of the UN Millennium Development Goals on the basis of partnerships, co-responsibility and good governance."
"2. The achievement of a global eco-social market economy by means of implementing the same ecological and social standards in all institutes and agreements, on a global scale.""
The funding of these development measures are a levy on financial transactions, a cerosine tax or special drawing rights with the IMF. The big challenge is finding an effective way of translating money into development without losing to worldwide.
Among the prominent supporters of the initiative are Muhammad Yunus, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker and Jane Goodall.

Donnelly River (Western Australia)

The Donnelly River is a river in the South West of Western Australia.
The main tributaries of the Donnelly River are Barlee Brook and Carey Brook.
The first European to sight the river was Lieutenant William Preston in 1831.
The river was named by James Stirling, the Governor of Western Australia, in the 1830s after a friend of his family, Admiral Sir Ross Donnelly.
The river runs primarily through State Forest reserves, although 25 land-holdings do have river frontage. The clearing of the catchment area is estimated at 15–20% with the land mostly being used for perennial horticulture, dairy and grazing.
Fauna.
The Donnelly is one of the few catchments left in the state that contains all of the regions endemic freshwater fishes. The native freshwater species that are found include salamanderfish ("Lepidogalaxias salamandroides"), freshwater cobbler ("Tandanus bostocki"), Western Minnow, western mud minnow ("Galaxiella munda"), black-stripe minnow, western pygmy perch ("Nannoperca vittata"), Balston's Pygmy Perch and nightfish.
The ancient pouched lamprey is also known to inhabit the river.
Many estuarine fish are found close to the mouth of the river, these include black bream ("Acanthopagrus butcheri"), sea mullet ("Mugil cephalus"), yellow-eye mullet, silverfish, Hardyhead, South West Goby ("favonigobius tamerensis"), Tarwhine, flathead, Australian herring ("Arripis georgianus"), and cobbler.
Several species have been introduced into the river, these include Eastern mosquitofish ("Gambusia holbrooki"), redfin perch ("Perca fluviatilis"), and rainbow trout ("Oncorhynchus mykiss"). The latter is the most common, being specifically introduced for angling purposes, with over 500,000 being stocked into the system between 1999 and 2004.
Flora.
The river originates in the an area of open Jarrah Marri forest between Bridgetown and Manjimup,
The area contains an understorey composed of such species as "Banksia grandis", "Allocasuarina fraseriana", "Agonis flexuosa", "Persoonia longifolia", "Acacia pulchella", "Macrozamia reidlei", "Xanthorrhoea preissii" and "Xanthorrhoea gracilis".
The river then flows through a large area of tall Karri forests these forests have an understory containing many species such as "Allocasuarina decussata", "Agonis flexuosa", "Bossiaea laidlawiana", "Trymalium floribundum", "Thomasia quercifolia" and "Pimelia clavata".
Toward the coast the floral composition changes as the soils change to swampy flats and consolidated dunes. Species such as Stout Paperbark, Swamp Paperbark, Yate, Warren River Cedar, Wonnich and various Banksia species start to dominate.

The plate is separating from the Australian Plate and the small Maoke Plate along a divergent boundary to the southeast. Convergent boundaries exist along the north between the Bird's Head and the Caroline Plate, the Philippine Sea Plate, and the Halmahera Plate to the northwest. A transform boundary exists between the Bird's Head and the Molucca Sea Collision Zone to the southwest. Another convergent boundary exists between the Bird's Head and the Banda Sea Plate to the south.

Tian Yi Ge

Tian Yi Ge (), also translated as Tianyi Pavilion or Tianyi Chamber, is a library and garden located in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China. It is the oldest existing library in China. Founded in 1561 by Fan Qin during the Ming Dynasty, in its heyday, it boasted a collection of 70,000 volume of antique books. 
The name "Tian Yi" refers to the concept of cosmic unity first described in a Han Dynasty commentary to the "Book of Changes". In Chinese alchemy "Tianyi" is linked to the element of water, thus it was believed by providing a watery name would protect the library against fire damage.
The Qing Dynasty emperor Qianlong visited Tian Yi Ge, and ordered officials to draw schematics of Tian Yi Ge's building plan and book cases as prototype to build several imperial libraries including Wenyuan Chamber in the Forbidden City, and Wenjin Chamber in the Chengde Mountain Resort to house the "Siku Quanshu" encyclopedia.
After the Opium War, the British army took many history and geography collections from the library. They were followed by thefts from local thieves; by 1940, the collection dwindled to less than 20,000 volumes. After the founding of PRC, due to government effort and donation by privated collectors, the collection now recovered somewhat to about 30,000 volumes, mostly rare antique Ming dynasty printed and hand copied volumes.
In 1982, Tian Yi Ge was established by the Chinese authorities as a National Heritage Site. Also located in the complex is the Qin Family Drama Stage.

Stephen McGill

The Right Reverend Stephen McGill PSS (born Glasgow 4 January 1912; died Glasgow 9 November 2005) was the sixth Bishop of Argyll and the Isles and second Bishop of Paisley.
Early life.
Stephen McGill was born on 4 January 1912 to Peter McGill and Charlotte Connolly in Glasgow, Scotland where he was educated at Holy Cross primary school and St Aloysius' College before entering the national junior seminary at St Mary's College, Blairs, Aberdeen.
Priesthood.
In October 1931 he entered Le Grand Séminaire at Coutances in France and was ordained priest of the Archdiocese of Glasgow at St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow by Bishop Henry Grey Graham on 29 June 1936. Following his ordination he returned to France where he entered the novitiate of the Sulpicians at Issy-les-Moulineaux, Paris and was incardinated priest of St Sulpice (PSS) in July of the following year. Further studies were undertaken at the Institut Catholique in Paris where he gained his licentiate in sacred theology (STL) in 1939.
Thereafter he was appointed to the staff of Le Grand Séminaire at Bordeaux in October 1939 and transferred to Le Grand Séminaire at Aix-en-Provence in January 1940. At this point the Second World War was under way in Europe so, following the fall of France to the Germans in June 1940, Father McGill, as a British citizen, had to make his escape via Marseille and Spain to avoid internment as an enemy alien.
On his return to Scotland he was appointed to the staff of St Mary's in Blairs where he remained as spiritual director until he was appointed rector in 1951. In 1952 he was made an honorary canon of the Glasgow cathedral chapter.
Episcopate.
When Bishop Kenneth Grant of Argyll and the Isles died suddenly in 1959 Canon McGill was appointed to succeed him by Pope John XXIII and was consecrated bishop in St Columba's Cathedral, Oban on 22 June 1960. During his time in Argyll and the Isles Bishop McGill attended sessions of the Second Vatican Council (1962 - 1965) and oversaw translation of the liturgy into Gaelic.
On the death of Bishop James Black in March 1968 Bishop McGill was translated by Pope Paul VI to the see of Paisley as his successor. There he remained until his retirement in March 1988.
Final years.
In retirement Stephen McGill maintained his interest in priestly formation and was a prolific letter writer. He died peacefully in his ninety fourth year on 9 November 2005 at Nazareth House, Cardonald, Glasgow. His motto was, in Latin, "Per Tuas Semitas" ("By Your Ways") taken from the hymn 'Panis Angelicus' by St Thomas Aquinas.

Ulrike Arnold

Ulrike Arnold (born 1950 in Düsseldorf) is a German artist.
Biography.
Ulrike Arnold studied music and art between 1968 and 1971, afterwards she worked as a teacher. From 1979 until 1986 she studied fine arts at the Düsseldorf academy in Professor Klaus Rinke's masters class. She was granted the Eduard von der Heydt apprenticeship of Wuppertal in 1988. Since 1980 the artist travels through all five continents to work although Ulrike Arnold mainly lives and works in Düsseldorf and in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Work as artist.
Earth paintings.
Earth paintings are typical of Arnold's art as she uses a unique material. She paints pictures with sorts of soil, minerals and stones on nettle fabric and on stone. She collects her colours in form of minerals which she then grinds to a paste for painting. The titles of her pictures correspond to the places across the world where she has found her ingredients, like Flagstaff, Arizona or Bryce Canyon in Utah. The structures, forms and colours of those paintings mirror the quality of the landscape where they are created on site. There they are exposed to the natural conditions of the place which even enhace their intensity.
Comet pictures.
Since 2004 Ulrike Arnold is continuously expanding her repertoire of resources. She is the first artist worldwide to use particles of meteorites (nickel, iron and chondrules) which she purchases from research facilities. Those valuable substances originate from asteroids and comets. Their dark dust bears witness to the early universe. With it, Ulrike Arnold goes beyond the use of terrestric materials to create cosmological pictures.
Collections.
Her art work can be found at many public museums and private collections, such as the North-Rhine-Westphalian State Chancellery at Düsseldorf, the Düsseldorf museum of arts, the Ernst & Young collection, also Düsseldorf, at Deutsche Bank, Cologne, GLS bank, Bochum, Dennis Hopper's private collection at Venice, Los Angeles, California, Langen Foundation's collection at Neuss, Center for Art and Environment, Nevada Museum of Art Reno, Nevada or the Vollstedt private collection, the Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff, and the Collection of Marvin and Kitty Killgore Southwest Meteorite Lab, Payson Arizona.

Spotify

Spotify is a commercial music streaming service providing digital rights management-restricted content from record labels including Sony, EMI, Warner Music Group and Universal. Launched in October 2008 by Swedish startup Spotify AB, the service had approximately 10 million users , about 2.5 million of whom were paying users. Total users reached 20 million by December 2012, 5 million of whom pay a monthly subscription fee that varies based on locale.
, the system is available for Android, BlackBerry, Boxee, iOS, Linux, MeeGo, Microsoft Windows desktop, Openpandora, OS X, Roku, S60 (Symbian), Samsung Smart TV, Sonos, Squeezebox, Telia Digital-tv, TiVo, WD TV, webOS, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone. Spotify is not available as a Windows Store app for Windows 8, although there is a third-party client available called Spotlite.
Music can be browsed by artist, album, genre, playlist, or record label, as well as by direct searches. On computers, a link allows the listener to purchase selected material via partner retailers.
As of December 2013, free Spotify music streaming is now available on all mobile devices and on desktop computers for unlimited durations. Features like offline listening and ad-free playback are only available for Premium subscribers of the service.
History.
Spotify was developed in 2006 by a team at Spotify AB, in Stockholm, Sweden. The company was founded by Daniel Ek, former CTO of Stardoll, and Martin Lorentzon, co-founder of TradeDoubler. Spotify Ltd. now operates as the parent company in London. Spotify AB handles research and development in Stockholm.
Launch.
The Spotify application was launched for public access on 7 October 2008. While free accounts remained available by invitation to manage the growth of the service, the launch opened paid subscriptions to everyone. At the same time, Spotify AB announced licensing deals with many major music labels. The company reported a US$4.4 million loss for 2008.
The first steps towards offering free accounts to the public without invitations were taken on 10 February 2009, when Spotify opened free registration in the United Kingdom. Registrations surged following the release of the Spotify mobile service, leading Spotify to stop open registrations in the UK for part of 2009, returning to an invitation-only policy.
Evolution.
On 4 March 2009, Spotify announced a security flaw in the service, by which private account information (including email addresses and hashed salted passwords) of members registered prior to 19 December 2008 were potentially exposed.
On 28 January 2010, Symantec's antivirus software marked Spotify as a Trojan horse, disabling the software across millions of computers.
In February 2010, Spotify received a small investment from Founders Fund, where board member Sean Parker was recruited to assist Spotify in "winning the labels over in the world's largest music market".
On 18 May 2010, Spotify announced that two more types of accounts were available: Spotify Unlimited, an equivalent to Spotify Premium without mobile and other features, and Spotify Open, a reduced-feature version of Spotify Free, which allows users to listen to up to 20 hours of music per month.
On 1 September 2010, the World Economic Forum announced the company as a Technology Pioneer for 2011.
During 2010, Spotify paid more than €45 million to its licensors.
In March 2011, Spotify announced that it had one million paying subscribers across Europe, and by September the number of paying subscribers had doubled to two million. On 25 March 2011, Spotify temporarily removed display advertising from external sources on its open and free accounts, due to an attack which used an exploit in Java to place malicious code on victims' computers.
Before their free mobile and unlimited offer, in most locations, a six-month free trial period was activated upon account registration or first login with a Facebook account, allowing the user to listen to an unlimited amount of music supported by visual and radio-style advertising. After the trial, Spotify had a listening limit of 10 hours per month, divided into 2.5-hour weekly portions (unused hours carry over). The only locations exempt from this rule are Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States. Australia, where ad-supported unlimited streaming continues on Spotify Free. An "Unlimited" subscription removes advertisements and time limits, and a "Premium" subscription introduces extra features such as higher bitrate streaming, offline access to music, and mobile app access. Users can try Spotify Premium for 48 hours by logging into Spotify Mobile for the first time, or getting a 30-day trial for their first month. An active Facebook account is required to use Spotify if the user has signed up using Facebook, but as of 30 August 2012, the option to create a Spotify username was again offered. Subscriptions are restricted to people with credit/debit cards or PayPal accounts registered in certain countries.
Monetization.
On 15 April 2011, Spotify announced via a blog post that they would drastically cut the amount of music that free members could access, effective 1 May 2011. The post stated that all Spotify Open and Spotify Free members would be transferred to a new product which limited audio streaming to ten hours per month. In addition, a user could only listen to a single track a maximum of five times. Spotify Unlimited and Spotify Premium members were not affected by this change. New users were exempt from these changes for six months.
On 17 June 2011, it was reported that Spotify had secured another $100 million of funding and planned to use this to support its US launch. The new round of funding valued the company at US$1 billion.
US launch.
On 14 July 2011, Spotify launched its US service, a major milestone after delays and years of negotiation with the four major record companies. On 30 November 2011, Spotify launched Spotify Apps and App Finder to "bring new and exciting music experiences built around your music tastes." App launch partners included Rolling Stone, We Are Hunted, Top10, Songkick, "The Guardian", Soundrop and Last.fm.
2012 onward.
On 29 March 2012, Spotify removed a restriction that limited non-US free users to five plays of every song; however, the restriction remained in effect in the UK and France. The ten-hour-per-month limit remained in place for all free accounts older than six months; however, the company also announced "continued unlimited free listening" for users in the US. 
On 19 March 2013, Spotify removed the restriction that limited free users in the UK to five plays per song.
In August 2012, "Time" reported that four million people were paid subscribers to Spotify, resulting in at least €20 million per month in revenue.
A further round of funding was closed in November 2012, with about US$100 million raised at a $3 billion valuation from a group of investors led by Goldman Sachs.
On 16 April 2013, Spotify was launched and became available in the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and Windows Phone Store in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico and Iceland.
On its release in April 2013, the Daft Punk single, "Get Lucky", received the highest number of plays of any song in a single day. The song appeared in a list of the ten most-played songs on Spotify, released in December 2013, and other artists such as Avicii, Robin Thicke, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis were also featured. In its annual review, the streaming company revealed that 24 million active users streamed over 4.5 billion hours of music in 2013.
Features.
Catalogue.
, the catalogue provided access to approximately 20 million songs via searching for artists, albums, titles, labels and genres, and gave users access to tracks from many major and independent labels. Some artists opted not to be available on Spotify. Additionally, some artists are missing in certain regions because of record label licensing restrictions. The Spotify desktop client allows music to be imported from iTunes, with the option of syncing with a mobile device. Users from the UK, France, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands can also buy most tracks, if available, from Spotify's download partner 7digital.
Playlists.
Users can create and share playlists, or edit them together with other users (see collaborative software). For this purpose the playlist link can directly be dragged into an email or an instant messaging window. If the recipient follows the link, the playlist downloads into the recipient's Spotify-client. Downloaded playlists auto-update if the author adds or removes tracks. Like normal links, playlist links can be used everywhere. The same principle also works for single tracks, which can be dropped on applications and websites at will. Many websites support sharing of Spotify playlists and songs and let users share, rate and discuss them.
Last.fm integration.
While Spotify does not automatically create preference-based playlists, it does integrate with Last.fm. This integration allows Spotify users to send songs from Spotify to their Last.fm account and "scrobble" them. Scrobbling via Last.fm integration allows Spotify users to learn which songs or artists they listen to the most. In turn, Spotify users can add a Spotify link to songs in their Last.fm library and send them to the Spotify client with the "Lastify" app. Since November 2011 an official app called "Last.fm for Spotify" enables recommendations based on listening history, embedded artist wiki information while listening with Spotify and more. See the support group on Last.fm for a list of features.
Radio.
Spotify also includes a Radio feature available to Spotify Free, Unlimited and Premium accounts, which creates a random playlist of songs chosen based on specified genres and decades. An Artist Radio feature creates a random playlist of songs by artists related to (and including) the selected artist. Artist Radio channels on Spotify provide background information on the selected artist, ranging from its history to a list of the artist's most famous singles. The Spotify radio function demonstrates distinct differences from its competitor, Pandora.
Premium (paid) Spotify users are allowed to skip as many tracks as desired, while Pandora places limits on the number of tracks that can be skipped. Free Spotify users on mobile (Android/iPhone) are limited to five skips, similar to Pandora. In August 2012 Spotify allowed users to "rate" tracks, improving the ability to organise the radio function based on user preference.
Social media integration.
Spotify allows registered users to integrate their account with existing Facebook and Twitter accounts. Once a user integrates their Spotify account with other social media profiles, they are able to access their friends' favourite music and playlists. Additionally, Facebook compatibility allows Spotify users to share music with Facebook friends through the use of the service's inbox. Spotify users are able to send tracks or playlists to friends who, in return, are able to access this music through their Spotify account. When using Spotify through your Facebook account, music stories appear on Facebook feeds alerting your friends to the music and playlists you are currently listening to. These feeds feature a play button that automatically starts the song or album in Spotify. 
On 26 September 2011, it was announced that all new accounts would require users to access via a Facebook login but the sign-up restriction was later removed on 30 August 2012, giving users a choice to either log in with Facebook or create a Spotify username. Sean Parker, the former president of Facebook and a major investor in Spotify, commemorated the integration at a f8 party at which Snoop Dogg, the Killers and Jane's Addiction performed.
Applications.
Users can access applications integrated in the Spotify desktop client, written in HTML5. Third party software writers can offer features related to music listening such as live sharing of concerts, lyrics, music reviews, and playlists. At the time of launch (30 November 2011 in beta mode), the supported applications were "Billboard", "Fuse", "The Guardian", Last.fm, Moodagent, Pitchfork, "Rolling Stone", Songkick, Soundrop, Tunewiki, and We Are Hunted.
In June 2012, Soundrop became the first Spotify app to attract major funding with a $3 million Series A of funding from Spotify investor Northzone.
Technical information.
Spotify software is proprietary and uses digital rights management (DRM) to prevent unauthorised use. Users who agree to Spotify's Terms and conditions agree to not reverse engineer the application.
The contents of each client's cache is summarised in an index that is sent to the Spotify stream hub upon connecting to the service. This index is then used to inform other clients about additional peers they can connect to for fetching streamed data for individual tracks being played. This is accommodated by each client, upon startup, acting as a server listening for incoming connections from other Spotify users, as well as connecting to other users to exchange cached data as appropriate. No official details are available about how many connections and how much of a user's upstream bandwidth the Spotify client will use when streaming; the Spotify client offers no way for the user to configure this.
Audio streams are in the Vorbis format at q5 (ca. 160 kbit/s), or optional q9 (ca. 320 kbit/s) for Premium subscribers. Spotify has a median playback latency of 265 ms.
As of version 0.4.3, it is possible to also play back local MP3 and AAC files, though this does not work in Linux using Wine because Spotify is "...blocking codecs with the identifier "WINE-MPEG3″ until the Wine system works satisfactorily." However, the native Linux version supports local files.
Spotify is a strong Debian GNU/Linux user, as said on systemd vs Upstart vs sysvinit Debian debate. 
Cache size and location is configurable. 1 GB or more disk space is recommended. On OS X, a G4 processor or higher is required. Users must set up an account to use the software. This account can be used on several computers, but music playback is limited to one computer at a time.
Spotify uses peer to peer transfers to supplement their available bandwidth. This has led to it being banned on large networks where users are not responsible for bandwidth costs.
Revenue model.
Spotify principally operates under a so-called 'Freemium' model: basic services are free and more advanced, or additional features are offered at a premium. This is augmented by income from music purchases within the player. As of 2013, Spotify offered a US$10 per month unlimited subscription package, close to the Open Music Model (OMM)—estimated economic equilibrium—for the recording industry. However, the incorporation of DRM diverges from the OMM, as well as from competitors such as iTunes and Amazon MP3 that have dropped DRM. In Denmark, for example, the cost is DKK49 (US$9.00) per month (as of 8 December 2013) for an unlimited subscription.
In February 2009, the duration of advertisements for non-paying users was reported as 15 seconds; although, in May 2009, "Neowin" reported that the approximate length had increased to 30 seconds.
A monthly fee removes advertisements and streaming limits, and increases the bitrate to 320 kbit/s for some songs. The fee also allows mobile usage for iOS, Android, Symbian, webOS, Windows Mobile 6.x, Windows Phone and most BlackBerry devices. Premium ecards (premium codes) were offered for the 2009 Christmas season that allowed recipients to upgrade an account to "Premium" status for 1, 3, 6 or 12 months.
Spotify offers music downloads in the UK at £0.99 per track (initiailly only available in the UK, France and Spain), in partnership with the 7digital music store. The feature was designed to provide the option to download high volumes of music from Spotify.
In October 2010, "Wired" reported that Spotify is making more money for labels in Sweden than any other retailer, "online or off". During 2010, Spotify paid more than €45 million to its licensors.
In March 2011, Spotify announced a customer base of one million paying subscribers across Europe, and by September, the number of paying subscribers had doubled to two million. In August 2012 "Time" reported four million paying Spotify subscribers, responsible for at least €20 million per month in revenue.
A 2012 report stated that Spotify posted a net loss of US$59 million in 2011, attributed to increased staffing costs, and licensing fees and royalties to record companies. However, in a report published in November 2012, Spotify was expected to reach revenues of US$500 million over the course of 2012, up from US$244 million in 2011.
Spotify announced on 6 December 2012 that more than five million global customers were paying to use their service, including one million in the US. Spotify also announced the existence of over 20 million active users worldwide.
By March 2013, Spotify had grown to six million paying customers globally (a figure that remained the same in December 2013) and 24 million total active users. In December 2013, the company launched a new website entitled 'Spotify for Artists' that revealed its business model and revenue data. The website stated that Spotify paid its artists a per-stream figure of between US$0.006 and $0.0084 (an average of £0.004). "Music Week" editor Tim Ingham's perspective was provided in a BBC article:
Unlike buying a CD or download, streaming is not a one-off payment. Hundreds of millions of streams of tracks are happening each and every day, which quickly multiplies the potential revenues on offer – and is a constant long-term source of income for artists.
On Spotify for Artists, the company claims that "a Spotify Premium customer spends per year compared to the average spend of a US music consumer who buys music (not including those who spend $0 on music).", with the annual value of the average US paying listener identified as US$120. The website also claims: "a Spotify customer is 1.6x more financially valuable than the average adult non-Spotify US music consumer."
Criticism.
Spotify has been accused of failing to compensate artists fairly. Helienne Lindvall of "The Guardian" reported that for "artists who 'signed up to a label' there's a tangible risk that revenue which comes from a possible sale of shares by the label would end up in the proverbial 'blackbox' (non-attributable revenue that remains with the label)." and that "indie labels... as opposed to the majors and Merlin members, receive no advance, receive no minimum per stream and only get a 50% share of ad revenue on a pro-rata basis."
In 2009 Swedish musician Magnus Uggla wanted to pull his music from the service, stating that after six months he'd only earned "what a mediocre busker could earn in a day". Norwegian newspaper "Dagbladet" reported in 2009, that record label Racing Junior had only earned NOK 19 ($3.00 USD) after their artists had been streamed over 55,100 times. According to an infographic by David McCandless, an artist on Spotify would need over four million streams per month to earn US$1,160 (equivalent to working full-time at a minimum wage job). 
Luke Lewis of "NME" points to problems with the Spotify business model, saying he was "convinced the 'free' aspect of Spotify is unsustainable" and that if "Spotify is to have a future, it needs to be a viable business".
In September 2011, US independent label Projekt Records entered a public disagreement with Spotify, stating "In the world I want to live in, I envision artists fairly compensated for their creations, because we (the audience) believe in the value of what artists create. The artist's passion, dedication and expression is respected and rewarded. Spotify is NOT a service that does this. Projekt will not be part of this unprincipled concept." In May 2012, British Theatre vocalist and Biffy Clyro touring guitarist Mike Vennart noted, "I'd sooner people stole my work than stream it from . They pay the artists virtually nothing. Literally pennies per month. Yet they make a killing. They've forced the sales way down in certain territories, which wouldn't be so bad if the bands actually got paid."
In March 2012, Patrick Carney of the Black Keys said that "Spotify isn't fair to artists" and that for "a band that makes a living selling music, streaming services are not a 'feasible' option." He called Spotify board member Sean Parker an "asshole" in reply to his claim that Spotify would make more money for the music industry than iTunes. "That guy has $2 billion that he made from figuring out ways to steal royalties from artists, and that's the bottom line. You can't really trust anybody like that."
Spotify's artist-in-residence responded to the criticism by stating that 70% of Spotify's revenue is paid out in royalties, and that the per-stream royalty rate doubled between the service's inception and mid-2012. Charles Caldas, CEO of the Merlin Network for independent artists, argues that the problem isn't Spotify's failure to pay out significant royalties, but that it's paid to the record labels, who then pass too little of it on to their artists.
In July 2013, Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke pulled all his solo music and that of his band Atoms For Peace from Spotify. In a series of tweets, Yorke stated, "Make no mistake, new artists you discover on Spotify will not get paid. Meanwhile shareholders will shortly be rolling in it. Simples." He went on to say, "New artists get paid fuck all with this model". Producer Nigel Godrich also addressed the concern by stating: " cannot work as a way of supporting new artists' work. Spotify and the like either have to address that fact and change the model for new releases or else all new music producers should be bold and vote with their feet." Responding in a statement, Spotify argued that, "Right now we're still in the early stages of a long-term project that's already having a hugely positive effect on artists and new music" and that they "are constantly talking to artists and managers about how Spotify can help build their careers".
In September 2013, Ministry of Sound sued Spotify, alleging that user playlists that mimicked the track listings of their compilation albums were infringing on copyrights for the albums themselves. Yorke renewed his sentiments regarding Spotify in early October 2013 during an interview with Mexican website "Sopitas":
I feel like as musicians we need to fight the Spotify thing. I feel that in some ways what's happening in the mainstream is the last gasp of the old industry. Once that does finally die, which it will, something else will happen.
David Byrne, formerly of the band Talking Heads, published his opinion on streaming services such as Spotify in the "Guardian" newspaper on 11 October 2013. Byrne stated that "if artists have to rely almost exclusively on the income from these services, they'll be out of work within a year" and countered the supposed ability to discover new music through services such as Spotify by arguing that the vital issue of sustainability is not addressed. However, Byrne concluded his piece by admitting: "I don't have an answer."
In the Spotify For Artists website launched in December 2013, the streaming service includes a section entitled "Spotify's impact on piracy" as a response to the criticisms against the company regarding the exploitation of musicians. Spotify states that it has proven the theory 'given a free and legal alternative, people will pirate less', and uses Sweden, Norway, Denmark, USA, Netherlands and the UK to provide evidence. For example, in Norway, the figure of 1.2 billion pirated songs in 2008 is compared to a figure of 210 million from 2012.
Clients.
Desktop.
Clients are available for Microsoft Windows (XP, Vista and 7) and OS X (10.5 or newer). Spotify withdrew support for any Mac OS earlier than OS 10.5 in 2012. Microsoft Windows 8 is not officially supported, and Spotify has not released a native client for Windows 8 (or newer) in the Windows Store.
A native Linux version for Debian 6.0 "Squeeze" and Ubuntu 10.04 is available, limited to the amd64 and i386 architectures. The Windows version can be run on Linux and FreeBSD using Wine. The Spotify website has a section devoted to this topic.
Version 0.8.8 received poor feedback. Some features, such as playlist filtering, were removed while sorting was broken. The interface changed from native C++ to web-based. 0.8.8 and newer versions offer slower performance and greater memory usage. As of July 2013 most complaints had not been resolved. Spotify offers no option to turn off automatic updates, however there are workarounds which allow to use pre-0.8.8 versions.
In December 2013, Spotify released a Spotify Premium client called "Spotiamp", which uses an interface that resembles version 2 of the popular music player Winamp (AOL, the owners of Winamp, were planning to discontinue the player). The client also contains an equalizer and support for Advanced Visualization System.
Mobile versions.
Mobile apps for Android, iOS, Symbian, BlackBerry OS, Windows Phone 7/8, Windows Mobile 6.0, and WebOS are available. The Windows service is a competitor to the Xbox Music functionality integrated within Windows desktops, tablets and phones; both services offer wireless streaming and unlimited listening for a set monthly fee.
As of 20 June 2012, Spotify radio streaming was free on the iPad and iPhone in the US.
The applications allow Premium subscribers to access the full music catalogue, stream music and listen to music when disconnected using Offline Mode. As of September 2013, "extreme quality" mobile streaming (~320kbit/s) is only available on the iOS and Android versions of the Spotify app.
As of December 2013, Spotify made its mobile app free for everyone, not just premium subscribers.
Web.
A browser version of Spotify was released in beta in 2012. The software uses Adobe Flash, presumably for its peer-to-peer networking ability. The application was released in March 2013.
Third-party clients and libraries.
Third-party (and open source) projects access Spotify services. The most prominent is Despotify, originally released as an ncurses text-mode client for Linux and OS X. All third-party applications and development libraries require a Spotify premium subscription.
Despotify.
Despotify is a free software open source client. It aims to provide tools to allow third parties to leverage Spotify's platform for new services. Its authors remain anonymous, but their website claims that they are a group of Swedish computer science researchers and security professionals who "believe strongly in the right to tinker with technology".
The software supports most mainstream POSIX-compliant operating systems for which there is an ANSI C compiler. It requires one of Core Audio, GStreamer, libao or PulseAudio. A Despotify-based client, Spot, supports jailbroken iPhones.
Spotify has blocked usage of Despotify for "Free" and "Open" accounts, but those with a "Premium" account can use Despotify. The Despotify team claimed that they would not attempt to circumvent the block. The code may however be forked by others to attempt to do this.
The Despotify library has language bindings for Python and Ruby. It depends on the OpenSSL, zlib and libvorbis libraries.
Geographic availability.
Spotify is available in Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Colombia, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In Estonia, Greece and Romania, the Premium service was offered until July 2009, but never the free version. Only customers with credit cards or PayPal accounts in one of the above-mentioned countries can buy a Premium account.
Spotify was launched in the US on 14 July 2011, in Germany on 13 March 2012, and in Australia and New Zealand on 22 May 2012. From 13 November 2012, it became available in Republic of Ireland and Luxembourg. From 11 February 2013, Spotify became available in Italy, Poland and Portugal. Spotify was launched in Mexico, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Iceland on 15/16 April 2013.
On 24 September 2013, Spotify was launched in Argentina, Greece, Taiwan, and Turkey.
On 3 December 2013, Spotify launched in Colombia as a pre-launch promo from Coca-Cola.
On 11 December 2013, Spotify launched in Costa Rica.
On 12 December 2013, Spotify was supposed to launch in additional 20 markets, bringing the total number up to 55. The following countries will be added: Bolivia, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Malta, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Slovakia and Uruguay.
Accounts and subscriptions.
As of 2014, the three Spotify account types are:
User community.
A community of websites, blogs and 3rd-party applications and tools support Spotify. Community resources include Facebook and Last.fm groups, Twitter bots and user forums, tools to display lyrics and services to list and notify users about new releases. In 2010, Spotify blog The Pansentient League held the first Spotify Community Site Awards, with categories such as "Best Playlist Sharing Site", "Best News & Music Finder Site" and "Best Playlist Generator".
Spotify led to an array of editorial content integrating playlists into articles. Popular music website Drowned in Sound is among the most notable examples, running every Friday as "Spotifriday" which involves a playlist of the site's content during the week shared with readers.

University Library of Southern Denmark

The University Library of Southern Denmark (SDUB) is a public library and accessible for everyone. It acts as a knowledge centre for the whole of the Southern region of Denmark and has departments in five cities. Its main users are researchers and students at the University of Southern Denmark but firms, organisations and educational institutions, e.g. upper secondary education schools, are among its users.
The University Library of Southern Denmark gives access to books, journals, newspapers, maps, music scores, microfilm and a large number of electronic resources. The Library has all in all about one and a half million volumes and gives access to about 63.800 electronic journals, 170.000 ebooks and 408 online databases (as os 07/2011). Its collections cover primarily the areas, which are researched and taught in at the University of Southern Denmark but almost all subjects are represented in the library’s collections. 
The University Library of Southern Denmark participates moreover in the national library co-operation and is able to provide books obtained from all the research and public libraries in Denmark. The library also co-operates with many foreign partners in order to provide books and journals – in printed and digital form.
The University Library of Southern Denmark has a number of special libraries and a co-operation with Odense University Hospital (OUH). For instance, the Mathematical Library, the Medical Research Library at OUH and the Music Department at the Carl Nielsen Academy of Music Odense (Det Fynske Musikkonservatorium) are all situated in Odense. The latter also houses and administrates the jazz collection of the University Library of Southern Denmark, which is just one of its many special collections.
The University Library of Southern Denmark has many services it can offer its users. For example, course resources pages and substantial library instruction activities, where library users are instructed in information retrieval and study habits. 
The library has a number of external co-operations, for example, with Denmark’s Electronic Research Library (DEFF). This has resulted in a range of online tools concerning plagiarism (Stopplagiat.nu), academic information management (UB-testen) and information literacy (BINKO). The last-mentioned tool is open source and can, therefore, be freely used by teaching institutions in order to adapt it to their own students.
History.
SDUB is the result of a merger between the research libraries of the four institutions, Odense University, the Southern Denmark School of Business and Engineering and the South Jutland University Centre, which now constitute The University of Southern Denmark. The merger was effective from the 1st January 1999. In 2006 SDU merged with the Odense University College of Engineering, so that Odense Technical Library became a part of SDUB. The Business School Centre in Slagelse was incorporated into the University of Southern Denmark in the beginning of 2007 and its library became the fifth campus library.

Sir Richard Herbert

Sir Richard Herbert (died 1510) of Ewyas, Herefordshire was the illegitimate son of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke and Maud, daughter of Adam ap Howell Graunt (Gwynn). Richard had a full brother named George. 
Sir Richard Herbert of Ewyas is distinguished from his uncle, Sir Richard Herbert of Coldbrook, brother of his father William Herbert.
Herbert legacy.
While the Earl of Pembroke title went to his younger, legitimate half-brother William, Richard realised success through his own merit and his descendants: "Sir Richard Herbert, of Ewyas, who, though illegitimate, is ancestor of the men who have really, in modern times, rendered the name of Herbert illustrious."
In 1465, Richard Herbert was granted Westminster, manors of Grove, Radnore, Mookas, Brutescourt, Throuckeston, Westhide, Egelton, Redehire, Howton and Wormeton Tirell, co. Hereford.
He was successful as a Gentleman Usher to Henry VII and appointed Constable and Porter of Abergavenny Castle on 22 July 1509. While Richard is most frequently titled "Sir Richard Herbert," there is debate as to whether Richard was a knight. Richard Herbert in "The Knights of England" was knighted in 1513, three years after this subject's death. According to Sil, Richard was never knighted, but was an Esquire. Richard is titled Esquire in 1465 when he was granted manors and lands.
In many sources, however, Richard is referred to as "Sir Richard Herbert." An article titled "The Family of Herbert" from "The Gentleman's Magazine" states that he was knighted by King Henry VIII, in which case Richard would have been knighted in the last year of Richard's life (died 1510) and the first year of Henry VIII's reign, which began in 1509.
Marriage.
Richard married Margaret, daughter of Sir Matthew Cradock of Swansea and Alice (Jane) Mancell, widow of John Malefant. Sir Matthew Cradow was receiver of Glamorgan, through whom Castleston Castle passed to his daughter Margaret and Richard.
Issue.
Richard and Margaret had three sons, one of whom was William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who became the 1st Earl of Pembroke (2nd Creation) on 11 October 1551. Existing Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery, and of Carnarvon, of the Duke of Powis, of Pool Castle (extinct 1747), descend from Sir Richard Herbert. Through the female line, of the Marquis of Bute, derives his Glamorganshire estates. William married Anne Parr, sister of Queen Catherine Parr, the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII. William served Henry VIII in many capacities, including Chief Gentleman on the Privy Chamber and the Privy Council and Receiver of the King's revenues. He was knighted in 1544 and later elected to the Knights of the Garter. The other son was Sir George Herbert of Swansea was ancestor to the Herberts of Swansea, Cogan, Cookham and the White Friars, extinct in 1739. Candleston Castle passed from Richard and Margaret to George.
Richard also was father to the illegitimate Herberts of Dinas Powis and Hengastell (Hen Gastell).
Death.
Richard died between 2 and 12 September 1510 and was buried in Abergavenny Church; his tomb has a lavishly decorated wall arch and an alabaster effigy.

Doncaster (York Road) railway station

Doncaster (York Road) railway station was built as a terminus for services on the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. It was reached by a triangular junction from the main line just outside of town. The station was set at the north end of town, just beyond the Doncaster Avoiding Line, in the fork of the old A1 and the A19 (York Road).
The line and its stations were ready for opening on 1 May 1916 but its five passenger stations, at Snaith & Pollington, Sykehouse, Thorpe-in-Balne, Doncaster (York Road) and Warmsworth never saw a passenger train. The route duplicated that of other railways in the area and the stations were some way from the villages they porported to serve.
The station was kept fully intact until the late 1960s when demolition finally came.
The only passenger trains to work over the line were enthusiasts specials, the last of these was the "Doncaster Decoy", which ran on 5 October 1968.
