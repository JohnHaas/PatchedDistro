Andrew L. Jefferson, Jr.

Andrew Leon Thomas Jefferson, Jr. (August 19, 1934—December 8, 2008) is an American lawyer, a former federal prosecutor, a former Texas judge, and a former federal judicial nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. "The Judge", as he was affectionately known in the Houston community long after his tenure on the bench, was the first black judge above the municipal level in the state of Texas since the United States reconstruction era.
Early life and education.
Born in Dallas, Texas, Jefferson graduated from Jack Yates High School in Houston, Texas in 1952 and then earned a bachelor's degree from Texas Southern University in 1956. Jefferson earned a law degree from the University of Texas School of Law in 1959. Jefferson also served as a Captain in the United States Army Reserve - Judge Advocate General's Corps and was honorably discharged. 
Professional career.
After beginning his career in private legal practice, Jefferson became an assistant criminal district attorney for Bexar County in 1962, and later that year became the chief assistant to U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy for the Western District of Texas — a role he held for six years.
In 1968, Jefferson became a trial and labor relations lawyer for Humble Oil, which later became Exxon. From 1970 until 1975, Jefferson was a judge in Harris County, Texas. In 1975, Jefferson went into private legal practice in Houston, Texas. Judge Jefferson has received the Anti-Defamation League National Torch of Liberty Award, the Forward Times Newspaper Community Service Award, the Charles A. George Community Service Award and the League of United Latin American Citizens National Community Service Award from LaRaza. Judge Jefferson was known in the Houston community as a leader, pioneer and coalition builder who helped bridge the gap between young and old and those of different cultural backgrounds. Jefferson also served as chairman of the board of the Dallas Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank and of the Texas Southern University Foundation. In 1996, Jefferson became a member of the International Society of Barristers, a society of outstanding trial lawyers chosen by their peers on the basis of excellence and integrity in advocacy.
Nomination to the Fifth Circuit.
On October 11, 1979, President Jimmy Carter nominated Jefferson to a new seat as a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. During the Iran hostage crisis that began on November 4, 1979, many of President Carter's initiatives as well as his run for reelection were crippled. Despite Democrats holding a majority of 58 seats in the United States Senate at the time, the Senate did not act on President Carter's nomination of Jefferson before his presidency ended, and newly seated President Ronald Reagan, declined to renominate Jefferson to the seat. The seat to which Jefferson was nominated was filled by Reagan appointee William Lockhart Garwood on October 21, 1981.
Trial Advocacy Endowment at Texas Southern University.
In 2001, The Andrew L. Jefferson Endowment for Trial Advocacy at the Thurgood Marshall School of Law was established at Texas Southern University. The endowment exists to preserve the jury trial in order to consider issues of ethics and excellence in advocacy and the role of litigation in society. As of 2013, the university has created no publicized initiatives in conjunction with the reported 1 million dollars donated.

Timothée Kolodziejczak

Timothée Kolodziejczak (born 1 October 1991) is a French football player who currently plays for French club Nice in Ligue 1. He plays on the left side and can alternate between the left back and winger positions. Kolodziejczak is a French youth international and has competed at levels. He played on the under-19 team that won the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. Due to the difficulty of pronouncing his surname, he is a commonly referred to as "Kolo".
Personal life.
Kolodziejczak was born on 1 October 1991 in Avion, Pas-de-Calais to a Polish father and a Martiniquais mother.
Club career.
Early career.
Kolodziejczak began his career at the age of seven playing for local club US Saint-Maurice Loos. In July 1999, he moved to hometown club CS Avion where he spent a year. In June 2000, Kolodziejczak joined professional club RC Lens. While in the club's youth academy, he trained alongside youth and international teammate Gaël Kakuta at the Centre de Préformation de Football in nearby Liévin, a training center exclusively for players brought up in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. He spent two years at the center training there during the weekdays and playing with Lens on the weekends. One of his trainers at the facility was former Polish international Joachim Marx.
After graduating from the club's youth academy, he was offered a five-year professional contract as Lens were attempting to tie down the defender who was being scouted by several prominent European clubs, most notably Manchester United. Kolodziejczak turned down the offer with hopes of signing elsewhere stating he had no confidence in the club. Following negotiations, it was announced on 21 August 2008 that the left back agreed to join seven-time Ligue 1 champions Olympique Lyonnais on a season long loan with a view to a permanent deal with Lens demanding at least €3 million in compensation for the player. With his move to Lyon, he joined international teammates Sébastien Faure, Yannis Tafer, Enzo Reale, Alexandre Lacazette, and Clément Grenier.
Lyon.
Upon his arrival to the club, Kolodziejczak was given the number 12 shirt on the first-team. However, due to signing late in the transfer window, he missed Lyon's entire pre-season campaign and was placed on the club's Championnat de France amateur team in the fourth division by manager Claude Puel. He made his reserve debut on 13 September 2008 in the derby match against Saint-Étienne's reserve team. The match resulted in a 2–1 victory with Kolodziejczak playing the entire match picking up a yellow card. Two months later, Kolodziejczak was called up to the first team for a league match against Paris Saint-Germain on 23 November 2008 to serve as the backup left back. In the match, he made his professional debut coming on as a substitute for the severely injured Anthony Réveillère in the 11th minute. Lyon lost the match 1–0 with Kolodziejczak being penalized with a yellow card late in the second half. Following the season, Lyon signed Kolodziejczak on a permanent deal with the player agreeing to a four-year deal and the transfer fee being priced at €2.5 million.
For the 2009–10 season, Kolodziejczak's playing time was limited. On 29 September 2009, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in the team's 4–0 victory over Hungarian club Debrecen appearing as a substitute for starting left back Aly Cissokho. Four days later, Kolodziejczak made another substitute appearance in a 2–0 win against his former club Lens. On 21 November, he made his first professional start playing 76 minutes in a 1–1 draw against Grenoble.
Nice.
In the summer of 2012, he moved to fellow Ligue 1 side Nice on a 4-year contract. He started the season as the club's first choice left back.
International career.
Kolodziejczak has featured for all of France's national youth teams beginning with the under-16 team. He made his debut with the team in the team's last match against Germany at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin on 30 May 2006. Germany won the match 1–0 with Felix Kroos scoring the lone goal. With the under-17 team, Kolodziejczak was a regular and made his debut in the team's opening match against Switzerland in a 4–0 victory. In qualification for the 2008 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship, he appeared in both rounds of qualification with the team finishing the Elite Round portion unbeaten, which led to qualification to the UEFA-sanctioned tournament. At the tournament, Kolodziejczak scored his first youth international goal against Turkey in the semi-finals. The goal came in the 69th minute with France trailing 1–0. The team later won the match 4–3 on penalties. In the final, France were defeated 4–0 by Spain.
On under-18 duty, Kolodziejczak made his debut in the team's opening match against the Ukraine. He only made six appearances with the team. With the under-19 team, Kolodziejczak was again called upon by coach Francis Smerecki making his first appearance with the team on 9 October 2009 in 4–2 defeat to the Netherlands. After consistently appearing with the team for the campaign, on 7 June 2010, he was named to coach Smerecki's 18-man squad to participate in the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. Kolodziejczak played in all five of the team's matches including the final match against Spain, which France won 2–1. The title is the country's second UEFA Under-19 championship.
Due to France's victory at the UEFA Under-19 championship, the nation qualified for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, which merited under-20 team appearances for Kolodziejczak. He made his debut with the team on 7 October 2010 in a friendly match against Portugal, which ended 3–3. Kolodziejczak, subsequently, appeared in four matches for the team during the 2010–11 campaign and, on 10 June 2011, was named to the 21-man squad to participate in the U-20 World Cup. He made his debut in the competition on 30 July 2011 in the team's 4–1 defeat to the hosts Colombia.
Due to his Polish descent, Kolodziejczak is also eligible to represent Poland at international level. At the age of 15, he was issued a proposal by the Polish Football Association (PZPN) who sought for the player to play for the country's youth international teams. However, due to not having Polish citizenship, Kolodziejczak would have been unable to play in an official match for Poland, which led to his father declining the opportunity and, instead, deciding that it would be better to wait a few years until coming to a decision.

People Show

The People Show is the longest running English experimental theatre company, based in the East End of London.
Founded by Jeff Nuttall, John Darling, Laura Gilbert and Mark Long in 1966 and performing its first show in the basement of Better Books in London's Charing Cross Road, the People Show was London's first performance art company with a "seminal role" in the evolution of British alternative theatre.
Although some People Show shows begin with scripts, these are largely just starting points for devised theatre performances by actors, musicians, poets and artists, tailored specifically to the spaces they take place in. In 1969 they staged a performance at London's Royal Court Theatre that involved inviting passers-by into a telephone box to look at some "dirty postcards", only to present them with "two sugar lumps ... coloured with red ink or, alternatively, a bra stuffed with baked beans".
From 1982 to 2013, the company was based at People Show Studios, a former church hall in Bethnal Green. People Show continues to be a nationally touring company, having produced 123 productions to date - the most recent being People Show 123: The Rummage Show, produced in collaboration with Roehampton University and ALRA (the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts). People Show Studios in Bethnal Green, London, was a vibrant creative hub for east London. The company is now based at the Brady Arts Centre in Whitechapel, London.

Lake Atalanta

Lake Atalanta is a reservoir along Prairie Creek in Rogers, Arkansas, used primarily for recreation, built in 1936 by the Works Progress Administration. The lake is named for Atalanta Gregory, the wife of O.L. Gregory, who donated most of the land that now forms the lake. Lake Atalanta Dam is earthen with rock fill, and is tall and long.
Lake Atalanta Park.
Today, Lake Atalanta is surrounded by the second oldest park in Rogers. The park contains a playground, picnic area, swimming pool, and walking trail. Just below the dam is a second city park, Lake Atalanta Dam Site, constructed in 1987.
Fishing.
Lake Atalanta is part of the "Family and Community Fishing Program" for Arkansas. The lake is stocked with channel catfish in the summer months, and rainbow trout in the winter months. Stocking schedules and the special regulations that apply can be found in the current Arkansas fishing and trout fishing handbooks.
History.
Lake Atalanta was constructed in 1936-1938 as a public works project of the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal-era agency. For the first ten years of its existence, the area around Lake Atalanta was undeveloped, and used primarily for fishing. In 1948 and 1949, a swimming pool, miniature golf course, roller skating rink, and restaurant were constructed. In the mid-1950s, Lake Atalanta became a water source for the city with the construction of a water treatment plant. During a drought in the 1960s, the lake nearly dried up, and was refilled by pumping water from nearby Beaver Lake. In 1970, Beaver Lake replaced Lake Atalanta as the city's water source.

Lince Dorado

Jose Cordero (born May 11, 1987) is a Puerto Rican professional wrestler better known by the ring name Lince Dorado. He is best known for working for Chikara and currently performs for the several independent promotions.
Professional wrestling career.
Chikara.
Debut (2007).
Dorado began his training in Mexico under El Pantera until he made his way to the United States in early 2007. On February 17, Dorado, Pantera and Sicodelico, Jr. made their Chikara debuts as a part of Chikara's first-ever King of Trios tournament. The team made an impressive impact, as they advanced to the semi-finals before falling to the team of Mike Quackenbush and ShaneSaw (Shane Storm and Jigsaw). Shortly after the tournament, he moved to the U.S. and began residing in New Jersey in order to compete for Chikara in addition to various promotions in the area. Dorado quickly garnered fan support due to his high-flying wrestling style and he was soon entered into the first-ever Rey de Voladores tournament, which brought together some of the most talented high flying wrestlers on the independent circuit. Despite advancing to the finals, including an upset win over established Chikara wrestler Jigsaw, Dorado lost the tournament Chuck Taylor. At the Anniversario weekend, Dorado began his first feud in Chikara against the returning "Marvelous" Mitch Ryder, which stemmed from Ryder's "patriotic" dislike of "the illegal immigrant Mexicans", which he claimed Dorado to be a part of. During the course of the feud, Dorado scored a major upset victory over Chris Hero via submission with the Chikara Special. The feud culminated when Dorado defeated Ryder in November in a hair vs. mask match. However, their match gained some notoriety after Dorado suffered a seizure and severe concussion after he over-rotated a shooting star senton in the finish of the match that resulted in his head hitting the mat. Post-match, Dorado began suffering a seizure and was tended to by Chikara's founder Mike Quackenbush and Daizee Haze before he was unmasked (though a towel was placed over the top half of his face in order to conceal his identity) and subsequently taken away from the arena in an ambulance. In December, Dorado was released from the hospital and returned to Chikara that same month, where he distracted Ryder during his match with Tim Donst, allowing Donst to score an upset victory.
King of Trios and The Future is Now (2008–2009).
Dorado would return to the ring in January, teaming with Claudio Castagnoli and Ophidian to defeat Mike Quackenbush, Tim Donst and Amasis in a Trios Increibles match. During the match, Dorado utilized a more grounded style of wrestling instead of his usual high flying style. Dorado then entered the King of Trios tournament, where he rejoined El Pantera and aligned with luchador Incognito to form Los Luchadores de Mexico. The team would go on to win the tournament, lastly defeating The BLKOUT (Eddie Kingston, Ruckus and Joker) after Dorado made Kingston submit with the Chikara Special. Following the tournament, Kingston was not seen for a couple of months afterwards. When Kingston returned, he immediately targeted Dorado and defeated him several times but was repeatedly unsuccessful in keeping him down, driving Kingston into to the point of total insanity. Aside from his feud with Kingston, Dorado joined former enemy Jimmy Olsen (who, at the time, began competing as both himself and as the second Equinox) and Helios to form The Future is Now in order to feud with The UnStable (Vin Gerard (the first Equinox), STIGMA and Colin Delaney). In late 2008, Olsen (as Equinox) and Dorado won the first-ever La Lotería Letal and were thus granted the three points required to compete for the Campeonatos de Parejas. Olsen (as Equinox) and Dorado, challenged the champions The Osirian Portal at Chikara's "Armdrags to Riches" event on November 16, 2008 in a two out of three falls match. Although Dorado gained the first pinfall, the Portal ultimately retained the title after pinning Dorado and then Equinox. On November 22, 2009, at the season eight finale "Three-Fisted Tales" Dorado challenged Player Dos for the Young Lions Cup, but was defeated after Dos German suplexed him on the ring steps. After the match Dorado was carried backstage by Equinox and Helios in a scene reminiscent of the events of two years prior.
Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (2010–2011).
On January 31, 2010, at the season nine premiere Dorado and Equinox were scheduled to be a part of Mike Quackenbush's team that was to battle the "rudo" stable Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (BDK). However, during the eight man tag team match Dorado turned on Equinox and joined BDK, who managed to win the match, when Claudio Castagnoli pinned Dorado's replacement in Quackenbush's team, Eddie Kingston. Afterwards Dorado explained his turn by claiming that the Chikara audience never accepted him, despite his superior athleticism and his two serious injuries suffered inside the Chikara ring. On March 20 at "Wit, Verve, and a Bit o' Nerve", Dorado, now sporting a new white and BDK-themed attire, defeated his former tag team partner Equinox in a singles match. On August 28, 2010, Dorado first defeated Gregory Iron in a singles match and then Adam Cole, Cameron Skyy, Keita Yano, Obariyon and Ophidian in a six-way elimination match to make it to the finals of the eighth annual Young Lions Cup tournament. The following day Dorado was defeated in the finals by Frightmare. In October 2010 Dorado made his first tour of Japan with Osaka Pro Wrestling. Dorado was advertised to take part in Chikara's shows on March 12 and 13, 2011, but ended up not appearing at the shows. Following the weekend, Dorado's profile was quietly removed from Chikara's website, confirming his departure from the promotion.
Independent circuit (2007–present).
After making his Chikara debut, Dorado wrestled for many different promotions sporadically during his tenure with Chikara. In May 2008, Dorado would win the Independent Wrestling Revolution Revolucha Cup after defeating Josh Abercrombie in a two out of three falls final. Dorado made his debut for Dragon Gate USA at Open the Heroic Gate in a dark match where he defeated seven other wrestlers. On October 9, 2009, Dorado won the Sweet Sixteen Tournament at F1RST Wrestling, defeating three other men in the final. A month later he took part in the Open the Freedom Gate Championship tournament, losing to Gran Akuma in the first round. Dorado kicked of 2010 by losing to Rich Swann in a match for the vacant Real Championship Wrestling Cruiserweight Championship. On March 26, Dorado won the Garden State Pro Wrestling Championship by winning a tournament for the vacant title. In May, Dorado lost to Shiima Xion in the first round of the Super Indy IX for International Wrestling Cartel. Two months later, he would lose to Xion again but this time it was for the IWC Super Indy Championship. Dorado won the F1 Heritage Championship after winning a war games match, later vacating it after an 84 day reign. In December, Dorado debuted for Full Impact Pro, losing to Craig Classic in the first round of the Jeff Peterson Memorial Cup.
After leaving Chikara, Dorado would primarily wrestle for I Believe in Wrestling, Florida Underground Wrestling and to a lesser extent Dragon Gate USA and its affiliates. Lince Dorado also started working for Dreamwave wrestling in 2013.
Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2012, 2013).
On October 4, 2012, Dorado wrestled a tryout dark match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), facing Kazarian. On January 12, 2013, Dorado took part in the taping of X-Travaganza (aired on April 5, 2013), wrestling in a seven-man Xscape match, which was won by Christian York.

NLR crane tank

North London Railway (NLR) Crane Tank was a 0-4-2ST steam locomotive crane tank type. Originally built in 1858 as a Sharp-Stewart 0-4-0ST, it was rebuilt into an 0-4-2ST with a steam crane carried by the trailing truck in 1872. NLR Number 29A; it was subsequently inherited by the LNWR in 1908, who gave it the number 2896, in turn the LMS in 1923 (No. 7217, later placed on duplicate list as 27217), and British Railways in 1948 (BR No. 58865). It was the oldest locomotive to be inherited by BR. And when finally withdrawn in 1951, it was the oldest surviving standard gauge engine in service with British Railways. It was scrapped at Derby Works.

Residential colleges of Rice University

The residential colleges of Rice University comprise eleven separate residential colleges which function as the primary housing, dining, and social organization for undergraduate students. The system was established in 1957 and was inspired by the residential college systems at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge as well as the American adaptations of the same at Harvard and Yale. Each student is randomly affiliated with a residential college upon matriculation and becomes a lifetime member of the college. The residential college system takes the place of a greek system, and has contributed to a sense of community that other universities have sought to emulate.
At academic ceremonies, including Matriculation and Commencement, the colleges process in the following order: the four original colleges in the order Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, and Wiess, followed by the other colleges in order of founding: Jones, Brown, Lovett, Sid Richardson, Martel, McMurtry, and Duncan. For the original four colleges, which became colleges at the same time in 1957, the processional order reflects the order in which the original buildings were constructed. For McMurtry and Duncan, which were built at the same time and opened simultaneously in August 2009, the processional order reflects the order in which the founding gifts were made.
The colleges are often classified by geographical location: Jones, Brown, Martel, McMurtry, and Duncan are the North colleges; Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, Wiess, Lovett, and Sid Richardson are the South colleges.
History of the college system.
The residential college system was instated in 1957 by converting East, South, West, and North Halls into the men's colleges of Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, and Wiess, respectively. Martel, Duncan, and McMurtry colleges were constructed in the period between 2001 and 2009. Today, when undergraduates are asked where they are from, many respond with the name of their college, not their home state. This is a testament to the centrality of the residential college system to the social life on the Rice campus.
Common characteristics.
Architecture.
Each college except Sid Richardson is built around a quadrangle, which serves as the central court of the college.
Each college building includes three principal structures:
Each college has a unique architectural style, and as a result there are a great number of different room configurations, with varying levels of modernity and condition.
Each college is also connected to a dining hall, known as a servery. Martel, Jones, and Brown colleges are served by the North Servery, while McMurtry and Duncan are served by the West Servery. In the South, Hanszen and Wiess colleges are served by the South Servery, and Will Rice and Lovett Colleges are served by the East Servery. Baker and Sid Richardson each have their own servery, called college kitchens.
Masters and Resident Associates.
Each of the residential colleges at Rice has two College Masters, a faculty member and his or her spouse. The Masters reside in a home adjacent to the college, and help cultivate a variety of cultural and intellectual interests among the students, as well as support an effective system of self-government. They administer the college and serve as liaisons between the students of the college and Rice.
Resident Associates (RAs) are Rice faculty or staff members who reside on campus with students. While each college has many associates, the RAs are selected to live on campus at the college to interact more extensively with the students. They live in apartment suites at the colleges, regularly attend meals with students, and are generally active members of student life. McMurtry College and Duncan College, due to their population size, also have Head Resident Fellows, who are meant to ease communication between RAs, the Masters, and the students.
Two of the longest-serving resident associates in Rice history are Dr. Gilbert Cuthbertson, professor of political science and resident associate at Will Rice College, and Dr. Bill Wilson, professor of electrical engineering and resident associate at Wiess College.
Governance.
Each college is in charge of an annual budget in excess of $50,000 and elects a government from its students to administer the college and the budget. The college governments can exert control over everything from event organization to upgrades to the college facilities. Governing documents for many of the colleges can be found online. Singular student presidents and chief justices are university mandated features of each college's government. Additional members vary per college, but typically include Treasurer, Secretary, and a plurality of representatives from each class. The executive officers, such as the President, Treasurer, and Secretary, form the Executive council, and the representatives combine with the council to form the college government, known by names such as Cabinet or Parliament, depending on the college. These councils meet weekly to dispense with business related to the organizational and social functioning of the college. The meetings are akin to town hall meetings and typically include refreshments; they also serve as a forum for members of the various clubs, theater groups, and intramural sporting clubs to announce and advertise upcoming events. In addition, each college elects and sends one senator to represent the college at the Student Association.
Traditions.
The traditional campus-wide Beer Bike competition is the largest annual student event held on Rice campus and the source of many rivalries and traditions among the residential colleges. In recent years, a tradition has emerged wherein the Sid Richardson men's team intentionally disqualify themselves using any of a variety of means, most recently with a fire extinguisher-powered "rocket bike." Sid Richardson has been disqualified in at least one race each year since 2000, with the exception of 2003 and 2007 when the biking was replaced with running due to inclement weather. Will Rice is well known for its dominance of the university's annual campus-wide Beer Bike competition among the residential colleges. Will Rice has held the longest winning streak on record in the alumni race (11 years from 1996 to 2006), and regularly fields strong men's and women's teams. After the inclusion of an Alumni Race, Will Rice has been the only college to have won all three of the races in a given year, which it has done on five occasions — 1983, 1986, 1999, 2009, and 2013. In addition, Will Rice holds the current track records for the men's, women's, and alumni races.
Baker College.
James Addison Baker College was the second residential building on campus. Baker college is named in honor of Captain James A. Baker, friend and attorney of William Marsh Rice, and first chair of the Rice Board of Governors. He served as the Rice Institute's first chairman on the Board of Trustees from June 24, 1891, until his death in 1941. He is known for having helped unravel the conspiracy surrounding the murder of the millionaire, who was chloroformed by his butler, Charles F. Jones, on September 23, 1900. The suspicious death of the Rice founder was concocted by Albert T. Patrick, a New York attorney, who forged a will naming himself the primary beneficiary to the large fortune, enlisting the Butler's help. Captain Baker, however, began an intensive investigation into the death of his employer, discovering the forgery, and returning the foundation to what would become Rice University.
As part of the university's original housing unit for male students, a dormitory, library, and dining room were built by Cram, Goodhue, & Ferguson of Boston, Massachusetts on campus, at the cost of $137,544.52. The now-Baker commons served as the university's central dining hall for 43 years, with beautiful engraved oak beams and the high vaulted ceilings of Elizabethan design. East Hall, which contained dormitories and is now referred to as the "Old Wing" of Baker, was completed soon afterwards. These buildings remained virtually unchanged until the residential college system was instated in 1957. The neoclassical architecture of the former East Hall was joined by a new two-story brick-colored wing, the design of which was shared with equivalent new sections being constructed at Will Rice and Hanszen colleges, in preparation for becoming residential colleges. A house for Baker's Master was also added. Baker was thus established as one of the five original colleges at Rice in the fall of 1957. In 1973, Baker and Hanszen became the first co-ed colleges at Rice. To include upperclass women, a lottery was held for Jones and Brown women to transfer into Baker.
Baker's colors are traditionally red, silver, and black, and the college associates itself with the devil and hell in its Beer Bike themes and college cheers, with the most popular cheer being "Baker, hell yeah!". The crest was selected, by popular vote, in 1958. The main design is derived from the family crest of Captain Baker's mother, with the owls across the shield indicating the connection to Rice University, and is inscribed with a phrase from Epictetus, which says "ifficulties are things that show what men are." Every year, Baker throws two public parties, Baker Blues, which is traditionally held on parents' weekend in the fall semester, and the Baker prom party, held in the spring. Some of the biggest social traditions include Baker Faire, Bakershake, the annual Christmas Tree brought home by the freshmen after their camping trip, coffeehouse, and of course Baker 13.
In 2009, construction began on a new residential wing. A portion of the former New Section was renovated and turned over to Lovett College. Baker's new wing is located between the Old Section and the Inner Loop road, and brought with it renovations to Baker's kitchen and the college coordinator's office. It was officially opened back to Baker students in the fall semester of 2010, who returned after a year of co-living with students from Duncan College. 
Will Rice College.
William Marsh Rice Jr. College, commonly known as Will Rice, was originally called South Hall, one of the original dormitories the university built soon after opening in 1912.
In 1957, Rice adopted the residential college system, and South Hall became Will Rice College, named for William M. Rice, Jr., the nephew of the university's founder, William Marsh Rice. The oldest of the eleven residential colleges at Rice, Will Rice was originally an all-male college and became co-ed in 1977.
Will Rice shares architectural similarities with Baker and Hanszen colleges; all three possess a white-painted "Old Wing" and a brick colored "New Wing". Will Rice's "Old Dorm" possesses a tower above the rest of the college, a design feature seen also in Hanszen and Baker.
The symbol of Will Rice college is the Phoenix, depicted in maroon and gold colors. The college commonly refers to itself as the "college of gods and goddesses." The elected governing body of Will Rice is called the Diet and administers a university-sponsored and fee-augmented budget of approximately $40,000 which supports social, athletic, and other programs for Will Rice's nearly 300 resident and non-resident members.
Will Rice is traditionally a strong contender in the university's annual campus-wide Beer Bike competition among the residential colleges. Will Rice has held the longest winning streak on record in the alumni race (11 years from 1996 to 2006). Since the inclusion of an alumni race, Will Rice has been the only college to have won the men's, women's, and alumni races in a given year, called a "sweep," which it has done on five occasions — 1983, 1986, 1999, 2009, and 2013. In addition, Will Rice holds the current track records for the men's, women's, and alumni races.
Each year, in the spring, the 80s and 90s section of Will Rice secede and form "Albert Patrick College," named after the man convicted of masterminding the death of the university's founder. However, this tradition has come to an end with the demolition of New Dorm. 
In 2009, work began on a new wing for Will Rice college, now referred to as "Newer Dorm." This new wing is located on the site of the former New Section, built in 1957; this building was torn down completely. A new servery, which is shared with Lovett, is part of the construction project. During the construction, the population of Will Rice lived in the residences of McMurtry college, which was founded that year, as a sort of sister college. 
Hanszen College.
Harry Clay Hanszen College was named for a benefactor to the university and chairman of the Rice Board of Governors from 1946 to 1950. The original building of Hanszen College was built in the neo-gothic style as a part of the original campus construction plan by Boston architectural firm Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson. A new housing wing was built in 1957 in conjunction with the development of the residential college system at Rice in response to the expanding undergraduate enrollment.
Rice Radio, the University's student-run radio station, and the Rice Coffee Shop began at Hanszen College. Hanszen was the first residential college at Rice to use its own crest. Shortly after the founding of the residential college system, the students created the blue, black, and yellow crest that in time became the symbol of the college, setting a precedent for the other colleges.
Hanszen often hosts guest lecturers; recent visitors include College World Series champion Coach Wayne Graham, former Rice president and renowned economist S. Malcolm Gillis, and director of the Houston Area Survey Stephen Kleinberg. University courses recently offered by Hanszen College have included Analytics in Sports, Spirituality in Film, and The Culture of Philanthropy.
Hanszen College is administered by the Cabinet, a body consisting of the Executive Board and Class Representatives elected by members of the college on an annual basis. The Cabinet supervises an annual budget of nearly $60,000, regulates the use of public spaces within the college, and serves as an official liaison between the College membership and the university administration.
Wiess College.
Harry Carothers Wiess College was one of the original four colleges created when the residential college system was implemented in 1957. In 2002, Wiess became the only college at Rice to relocate from one building to another. Wiess is currently the southwesternmost residential college, located adjacent to Hanszen and the South Power Plant. Male and female members of Wiess College are known equally as "Wiessmen".
Wiess College is named for Harry Carothers Wiess (1887–1948), one of the founders and one-time president of Humble Oil, now ExxonMobil. He was elected as a life member of the Board of Trustees of Rice University in 1944 and appointed vice-chairman in 1946. He left money for the construction of a new dorm after his death in 1948.
Wiess Hall was completed in 1949, but carried the name "North Hall" until its dedication in March 1950. It was laid out as an E-shaped building, with three north-south wings, joined on the north ends by a long east-west spine, forming two open quadrangles. The building was two stories high except for the three-story center wing. The hall was designed to house about 200 students in 20 single and 90 double rooms. Each room at Wiess opened directly to an exterior walkway that wrapped around the entire building. This design incorporated two features that were innovative at the time: every room had a semi-private bathroom and every room (except room 228, which was reserved for freshmen) had windows on at least two sides—an important adaptation in the years before air conditioning.
Wiess Hall became Wiess College in 1957. Converting the dormitory into a college included the creation of two Resident Associate suites, construction of Wiess House, the home of the Master and family, and construction of the Wiess Commons (designed by Wiess undergraduate architecture students Tim "Frog" Barry and Dan Canty for a class project), the eating hall and round-the-clock gathering space for college members.
Because of Wiess's outward-facing architecture, life at Wiess centered on the outdoors. The two quadrangles developed distinct characters. The quad between the center and west wings became known as the "Acabowl" and was the center of the college's social and recreational activity. At various times students installed a trampoline ("Aca-tramp") or above-ground pool ("Aca-pool"). The other quadrangle, between the center and east wings, was known by analogy as the "Backabowl" and tended to be used for quieter activities, such as sunbathing.
The original residential building suffered from rapid deterioration in the 1990s. In 2002, the university opened a new building for the college, located south of the original building. New Wiess encloses a single large quadrangle, which retains the "Acabowl" name. The new building also preserved what Wiessmen considered a salient feature of the old: the fact that all rooms at Wiess open directly onto exterior walkways or balconies. A glass-walled commons forms the north side of the Acabowl, with three four-story residence wings forming the other sides. The portion of the Acabowl immediately adjacent to the commons is known as the Acaterrace. The original Wiess Hall and its adjoining commons were razed during the winter break between Fall 2002 and Spring 2003.
Wiess considers itself to have an intense community spirit, signified by the slogan and cheer "Team Wiess", which has been used consistently since the 1970s.
Aspects of Wiess life include family-style dining and freshman waiting, Tabletop Theater, the Ubangee, pumpkin caroling, Night of Decadence, "Hello, Hamlet!", the Pace Mannion fan club, the turning of the statue of university founder William Marsh Rice, and the War Pig.
One of the most influential persons in Wiess history was electrical engineering professor Bill Wilson, who served as resident associate from 1978 to 2006 and as interim Master in 1982-83, which was also the year in which Wiess became a co-ed college. Wilson, known to generations of students as Dr. Bill, was a fixture of Rice's college system and the keeper of many Wiess traditions. In addition to his many teaching awards, he is the only person to have won the Student Association's Mentor Recognition Award twice. After his unexpected death in January 2009, his memorial service was held at the Wiess commons. In December 2009, the Rice board of Trustees, with the consent of Wiess College, decided that the new Masters' residence at Wiess will be named Wilson House, in honor of Dr. Bill. Dedicated on March 11, 2011, Wilson House is the first building at Rice named after a college Master or Resident Associate, and the first Masters' residence to bear a name distinct from that of its associated college.
Notable Wiessmen include Walter Loewenstern (1958), Harold Solomon, and Ricky Pierce (1982).
Jones College.
Mary Gibbs Jones College, built as the first women's dormitory at Rice University, is named after Mary Gibbs Jones, wife of prominent Houston philanthropist Jesse Holman Jones. Jesse H. Jones supported its initial construction with a $1 million donation.
The college was built in 1957, consisting of two four-story structures named "North" and "South." It was designed by architects Lloyd & Morgan. Not only was it the first housing for women on campus, it was also the first building designed specifically as a residential college and also the first building to be centrally air-conditioned. 
Lloyd & Morgan used pink marble in the construction of Jones College to indicate its status as housing for female students. In 2002, an additional four-story building, "Central," was built in between North and South. The new building connects to both original buildings at every level except the ground floor (a short walk separates South and Central). The wing was designed by noted post-modern architect Michael Graves.
In the early days, the culture of the all-female Jones College was quite conservative. At meals, each table had a hostess, and dinner was served family style. Strict rules were enforced by house mothers when men from the south colleges visited the female students. The students even had to abide by a strict curfew - 11 p.m. on weekdays and 2 a.m. on weekends.
In the 1970s, Jones began phasing out many of the strictest rules, and in the fall of 1980 Jones became co-ed. Male students from the south colleges were given the chance to apply for transfer to Jones. Lovett, another Rice residential college, went co-ed the same year, so many of the new Jones residents were former Lovett residents. Jones women who disagreed with the decision to go co-ed were allowed to transfer to Brown College, which remained all-female until 1987. In 2001, construction began on the new Jones Commons and Jones Central. The new Jones Commons opened for use in March 2002. Jones Central opened in August 2002. During the same time, Jones lost its parking lot to the newly constructed Martel College.
Jones' student government is set up as a Cabinet comprising the Executive Officers, elected representatives from each floor, and one elected off-campus representative. The Cabinet meets bi-weekly, and by tradition Cabinet meetings are preceded by a study break.
Jones is a college with an indoor setup which has a kitchen and two lounges on every floor. Jones is unique among the colleges due to its large number of singles. Jones also has 4 4-single suites and 2 6-single suites, along with doubles and freshman corner doubles.
Notable alumni from Jones include George P. Bush and current Mayor of Houston Annise Parker.
Brown College.
Margarett Root Brown College is currently the third largest of the eleven residential colleges at Rice, behind both McMurtry College and Duncan College. Founded in 1965 as an all-women's college, Brown became co-ed in 1987.
The history of Brown dates back to the early sixties, when Jones College was the only all women's college on campus. This caused such a severe housing shortage that some Rice women were housed in the dorms of nearby Texas Women's University. Through the generous $1 million donation of George R. Brown and his wife Alice Pratt Brown, a new women's residential college was established in the memory of their sister-in-law, Margarett Root Brown. Up until her death in 1985, Alice Pratt Brown was an active patron of the college, giving the college much of the furniture and art in the first floor lobbies and private dining room.
In the beginning, Brown College was filled primarily with women who had volunteered to leave Jones in order to start a new college. Brown had a housemother who lived in the resident associate’s apartment and required all women to check in and out of the building at night and on weekends. The first Master of Brown was Frank Vandiver, who later became president of Texas A&M. In 1966 he resigned from Brown because of a “scandal” – the members of Brown voted to drink alcohol in their own rooms (provided they were of legal drinking age). Vandiver resigned because he considered it inappropriate behavior for young ladies.
Brown was the last single-sex female college after Jones went co-ed in 1980. Male members were accepted into Brown in 1987. However, the community bathrooms on all floors remained coed until 1994, when the bathrooms were remodeled and separate facilities for men and women were built on each floor. The new 4-story wing at Brown opened in 2002. The new wing houses 56 additional students, making Brown the largest residential college on campus (it was previously the smallest) until the opening of McMurtry and Duncan. Unlike the tower, which consists of double and single rooms with community bathrooms, the new wing is made up of four-person suites. Each suite has four small single rooms, a large common room, and a private bathroom.
Lovett College.
Edgar Odell Lovett College is the seventh-founded residential college, named after the university's first president. Lovett opened in 1969 as an all-male college, becoming co-ed in 1980 when members of the college exchanged places with the female members of Jones College. Its first class mostly comprised volunteers from other colleges. Lovett sponsors numerous community and social events throughout the year, including theater productions and the Lovett Undergraduate Research Symposium. Lovett's college crest is interestingly based upon the Lovat family crest, who are not related to Edgar Odell Lovett.
The distinctive brutalist architecture of Lovett has led many to compare it to a giant toaster. This is due to the concrete grating that surrounds the third, fourth, and fifth floors, a design feature intended to make Lovett riot-proof in reaction to the student riots of the late 1960s, most notably the Abbie Hoffman riot of 1967. Other riot-proofing features include the limited reach of the elevator, which does not reach the sixth floor, to prevent students from throwing furniture off of the only exposed higher floor. Some have called Lovett's architecture style "modern American prison" because of the intersecting horizontal and vertical elements.
"The grating" now protects Lovett students from hurricanes; in fall of 2005 Lovett students were among the only Rice students allowed to stay in their rooms during Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Ike. As a tongue-in-cheek homage to Communism and the purported Soviet architecture of the college, the men of the founding class named their college government the Central Committee. The main body of the crest was taken from the Clan Fraser of Lovat and modified by adding a stag to each side.
Lovett is made up of four buildings: a six-story residential building, an additional two-story residential building, which was acquired from Baker in fall of 2010, a single-story commons, and the Masters' house. All of these buildings are structurally connected but have separate entrances and spaces. The majority of the rooms in the residential building are two-person suites, connected in pairs by a shared bathroom. Lovett House is a full two-story home in which the masters reside. The masters often host dessert at their house for special occasions, as well as private Central Committee meetings. The Lovett basement contains a number of facilities for use by the college members, as well as storage space for the various committees. The basement has a game room with various gaming tables, a movie room with couches and a projector, a kitchen, computer room, music room, weight room, and other spaces. The Wiener Hole is Lovett's public study space. It contains the Lovett test file, which contains records of previous tests in various classes. Lyle's, named for former Lovett resident associate Lyle Angene and also known as the Lovett Undergrounds, is a combination bar and performance space located in Lovett's basement. Lyle's is equipped with a sound system, stage, and lights, as well as bar equipment, including a kegerator. Seating for more than two hundred people can be moved into the space for performances. Lovett Theater and various Rice-wide performance groups, such as the Rice Philharmonics and Spontaneous Combustion, often use Lyle's for their performances; it also often acts as a space for smaller private parties.
In 2009, work began on renovating a portion of Baker College's former New Section, which was transferred over to become Lovett's New Section starting the in 2010 fall semester. A new servery, shared with Will Rice College, was recently built as part of the construction project and named Seibel Servery.
Notable alumni include José Cruz, Jr., John Doerr, Brock Wagner, John Kline, Ann Saterbak, Alberto Gonzales, and Matt Anderson. Nobel Laureate Robert Curl was the first college Master, and George H.W. Bush served as a community associate.
Sid Richardson College.
Sid Richardson College (also referred to as Sid, SRC, Sid Rich, or Richardson College) opened in 1971 as a men's residential college. Like the other residential colleges on the Rice campus, Sid Richardson College provides undergraduate residential and dining facilities, social organizations and student government, as well as faculty, alumni, and community associates. A $2 million pledge from the Sid Richardson Foundation, which was established by Texas oilman, cattleman, and philanthropist Sid W. Richardson (1891–1959), funded the construction of the college. The college became co-ed in 1987.
Sid Richardson College is the tallest building on the Rice campus. It has seven floors, each of which is split into an upper and lower level, effectively giving the building fourteen stories. Unusual among Rice buildings, the high-rise was a response to a shortage of University land and was designed by the architectural firm Neuhaus and Taylor. Sid Rich has enough beds to accommodate 220 students. Original plans called for the eventual construction of a second tower, but the plan was never followed through. In similar fashion to Lovett, the Sid Masters' house is connected to the residential tower; it comprises the first floor of the tower, while the mezzanine of the residential building is actually the second floor of the tower.
The first floor of Richardson College features a commons, a private dining room, and an "off-campus" lounge. The lounge consists of a pool table, two television sets, and a Nintendo 64. In between the commons and the "off-campus" lounge are 16 cubbies. It has become a popular pastime for Sidizens to attempt to fit inside the said cubbies.
Although Richardson College is not built around a quad, there is a similar outdoor feature of the college known as the "country club." The country club consists of a field, volleyball court, tether ball, hammocks, and an adult-sized swing set.
In addition to providing basic residential and social services to its residents, Richardson College is rich with traditions, which have included some notorious pranks. For example, Richardson students have made use of the six balconies towering above the main entrance of the college to "douche" unsuspecting visitors—including past Rice University president George Rupp and his wife—with buckets of water as they climb the steps to the double doors. While such "free-flowing water" is the only sanctioned projectile, rogue students have also flung flour tortillas and, in one particularly infamous situation, a couch. During the mid-1970s, students moved a Karman Ghia automobile into the dining area. Photographic evidence can be found in the Rice Campanile.
Another prank that is quickly becoming a tradition is the Orc Raid. Sidizens dress up by smearing themselves with black paint, wearing black clothes and carrying around torches with doll heads. They then proceed to run around campus at night to terrorize the other colleges and crash events.
Other unique pastimes include Balcony Ball, Vatoring, and Death Ball. Every Friday afternoon from 3:00-6:00pm, the college's main speakers, affectionately known as the "stacks," blast music in what is known as "Radio Free Sid" (the named derived from Radio Free Europe of the Cold War era) across the campus from the 7th floor balcony. Radio Free Sid begins and ends each roughly 3-hour-long set of music with AC/DC's "Back in Black," widely considered to be the college's theme song.
Sid Richardson has also hosted the last five Houston Conferences on Theoretical Neuroscience (starting in 2004), thanks to a relationship between the GCC and former Sid Richardson Master Steve Cox.
Notable alumni include Steve Jackson, Philip Humber, and Mark Durcan, CEO of Micron Technology.
Martel College.
Marian and Speros P. Martel College is the ninth-founded residential college. It was established with a $15 million donation from the eponymous Marian and Speros Martel Foundation, a longtime benefactor of Rice University. The college's building was designed by noted architect Michael Graves and housed its first students during the 2002-2003 school year. Martel is one of eleven residential colleges at Rice University; it is located adjacent to Jones and Duncan colleges on the north side of campus, sharing the North Servery with the former. The college prides itself on its adopted Greek heritage, a tribute to its benefactors' country of origin. Aspects of Greek culture are incorporated into a number of college events, and an interior staircase of the college features a four-story map of Athens painted by Joshua Krezinski (class of 2007). The second and fourth quadrants of Martel's crest represent the cross and stripes of the Greek flag, while the other two are reserved for the Athenan owl, a symbol of wisdom taken from the University's academic seal, and the "MC" glyph representing the college's name. The crest was designed by the building's architect. The Martel College colors are representative of the Greek flag and the building's architecture. The blazon of the Greek flag is "Azure, four bars Argent; on a canton of the field a Greek cross throughout of the second." While azure often associates with a deeper blue, Martel College uses a lighter tincture of azure known as bleu celeste or "sky blue." Also, the argent used by the College favors a bright, reflective white instead of the more silvery tincture. Maroon represents the building's brick and paint scheme. Members of Martel College are known as "Martelians."
As the third-most-recently founded college, Martel's history is short, and commonly includes the story of Speros Martel, the Greek immigrant whose estate provided the funding necessary to build the college. The official groundbreaking of the new Martel College took place on April 10, 2000. Among those attending were the newly instated Martel Masters Joan and Arthur Few, who had previously been Masters at Baker College from 1994 to 1999.
The first new students accepted as members of Martel were required to live off campus during the fall 2001 semester until the completion of the College's construction, which was scheduled for early 2002. However, in June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison struck the Houston area and delayed this by two months. Applications for freshman transfers were made available in October 2002. Sixty-three freshman were accepted, five each from Brown and Jones Colleges, and up to 12 from each of the other colleges. Martel members named physics instructor Gary Morris and intramural sports director Tina Villard as Martel's first resident associates.
Martel's student government is named the Parliament, and meets weekly in the college commons. Elected officials include President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Treasurer, Secretary, Chief Justice, and Class Representatives (4 per class).
Michael Graves, architect of Martel College, designed the four-story, building. Formed around a central quadrangle, Graves’s design follows the style of the 1910 general plan of Boston architect Ralph Adams Cram for the Rice campus. Martel was erected on the parking lot that formerly served the adjacent Jones College. Martel is an open, four-sided shape. Each side of the shape forms a wing of the college. The wings terminate on the side closest to North Servery in a five-story rotunda, a spiral staircase enclosed within a stack of rounded floors, providing the college with its sundeck, where many events are held. The easternmost wing contains common areas, the game room, a kitchen, and the TV room. The rotunda leads into the Commons, a cathedral-like room with a high ceiling that serves as a cafeteria, meeting room, and auditorium, among other functions. The college also includes two apartments for Martel's resident associates, a faculty apartment for visiting professors, and a neighboring house for the College Masters and their family. Martel is also the only college to feature a sally port in its construction; newly matriculated students traditionally walk through it passing a torch between themselves as the final step to becoming new Martelians.
Alumni include Jason Colwick, 2009 NCAA pole vault champion, and Morris Almond, a professional basketball player.
McMurtry College.
Burt and Deedee McMurtry College is the tenth college founded as part of Rice's residential college system. McMurtry College was named after Burt and Deedee McMurtry, graduates of the Rice class of 1956. Burt McMurtry was part of the student-faculty committee that evaluated the need for and eventually instituted the college system at Rice University, beginning in 1957 with the original five colleges. The College was conceived jointly with the adjacent Duncan College as part of Rice's Vision for the 2nd century, which includes plans to increase the size of the student body by 30%. The College opened its doors on August 16, 2009.
Despite its status as a young college, McMurtry has already established its own unique culture. During the Spring 2009 Beer Bike, McMurtry was christened in the "Thresher" newspaper as the "Mongol College," as it had not been finished at the time yet it was involved in pranks during Willy Week, and it could not be pranked by any other college as McMurtry wasn't complete. This was due to O-Week coordinators and advisers and co-advisers of McMurtry (chosen a semester ahead) showing their spirit for the upcoming new college. McMurtry has been assuming much of this "Mongol" culture by referring to the round commons as "Yurt," a name that also references the fact that, due to construction delays caused by Hurricane Ike, McMurtry was forced to use a tent as commons for weeks until the actual commons was completed.
The building was designed by Hopkins Architects, a leading English firm specializing in sustainable architecture. It offers 324 beds for student housing. The college is constructed as a single, squared-off horseshoe-shaped wing surrounding a central quad, rising to a height of five stories, dwarfing the nearby Martel and Jones Colleges. The college has double and single rooms that open directly out onto interior hallways, in contrast to the exterior hallways at Martel and Wiess, which were previously the two most recently renovated colleges. Common showers are located around the stairwells at each "elbow" in the building, and fully functional pod bathrooms are located in each double bedroom. The first floor contains classrooms, an off-campus lounge, other amenities, and the only circular commons on campus.
McMurtry College is across from Duncan Hall and the Inner Loop road. Duncan College is immediately north of it, connected to McMurtry by West Servery, which is parallel to Abercrombie Engineering Laboratory.
Duncan College.
Anne and Charles Duncan College is the eleventh college founded as part of Rice's residential college system. Duncan College was named after Anne and Charles Duncan, Jr., long-standing contributors to Rice University who donated money for the new college. The college was conceived jointly with the adjacent McMurtry College as part of Rice's Vision for the 2nd century, which includes plans to increase the size of the student body by 30%. Duncan opened its doors on August 16, 2009, right in time for O-Week 2009, which saw the arrival of the first Duncan freshman class. Due to renovations in Baker College and in order to help the new college adapt to the university, Baker College students lived in Duncan with the first freshman class. This led to the joint name of "BaDunc" for sporting and other events. Duncan began to operate by itself beginning in fall 2010 with a new freshman class, a returning sophomore class, and upperclassmen consisting of students from other colleges who accepted invitations to transfer. The college's first Masters, Marnie Hylton and Luis Duno-Gottberg, have chosen to stay with Duncan for several more years, and the final constitution is going through its last stages before approval. It has also chosen its colors as forest green, white, and gold. It chose government officials, RAs, and a College Coordinator in the spring of 2010, and the crest was revealed during the fall 2010 semester at the dedication ceremony.
Due to the request and contribution of Anne and Charles Duncan, Duncan College is one of the "greenest" buildings on Rice campus, as well as the entire city of Houston. Like nearby McMurtry College, the five-story building was designed by Hopkins Architects of London and offers 324 beds for student housing. The building is the first gold-level Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) facility at Rice and the first LEED student residential-housing in the United States. The facility is designed to retain water for irrigation purposes and has motion detector lights which will turn on or off according to the flow of people. The building will decrease energy consumption by up to 25% as well as cut back on water usage. Air conditioners power off when windows are opened.
Going into its fourth year of existence, Duncan College has already begun to establish its own culture and traditions. Duncan is well known for its techno dance parties. Often after forum meetings, music will suddenly begin to play and students will spontaneously have a dance party. It also has its own techno theme song, originating from Baker and Duncan's "The Kids Want Techn-O-Week." Duncan College has also established a Monday night tradition, known as "Monday Night Lights." When a few students went down to play ping-pong one night, they noticed that the ping pong table they had played on actually belonged to Baker College, who took its table back. Instead of going to bed, they made a makeshift table in the quad out of extra tables and using toilet paper as the net. People noticed the table and came down to the quad join in, watch and even play acoustic instruments. Monday Night Lights is now a weekly event.
Architecturally, Duncan has the same features as McMurtry with minor differences emphasized in order to establish its uniqueness. For example, Duncan Commons is rectangular in shape, contrasting the round McMurtry Commons. Also, Duncan quad has different features from McMurtry, such as a fountain by the Commons, smaller trees, and walkways that go across the quad. The interior, however, is virtually the same, as both colleges contain mostly doubles in the hallways and single rooms in the corners, with doubles having a pod bathroom inside and singles sharing common bathrooms. Both also have green roofs and fifth floor doubles and suites that open to the outside. The interior hallways of both Duncan and McMurtry were designed as contrasts to the other two most recently built residential colleges, Martel and Wiess, which have exterior hallways.

Africover

Africover is a UN project which collects and collates geographical information on Africa using satellites. It gathers data on areas such as land usage, climate conditions and it also locates natural resources. One major usage of this system has been to provide flood warnings to governments and NGOs, who then pass the information onto farmers.

The Mudfog Papers

The Mudfog Papers was written by Victorian era novelist Charles Dickens and published from 1837–38 in the monthly literary serial "Bentley's Miscellany", which he then edited.
"The Mudfog Papers" relates the proceedings of a fictional society, 'The Mudfog Society for the Advancement of Everything', a Pickwickian parody of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. (The latter, founded in York in 1831, was one of numerous Victorian learned societies dedicated to the advancement of Science.) Like "The Pickwick Papers", "The Mudfog Papers" claim affinity with parliamentary reports, memoirs, and posthumous papers. The serial was illustrated by George Cruikshank.
The fictional town of Mudfog was based on Chatham in Kent, where Dickens spent part of his youth. When "Oliver Twist" first appeared in "Bentley's Miscellany" in February 1837, Mudfog was described by Dickens as the town where Oliver was born and spent his early years, making "Oliver Twist" a continuation of "The Mudfog Papers"; but this allusion was removed when the novel was printed in book form.
At the conclusion of his first contribution, about the mayor of the provincial town of Mudfog, Dickens explains that "this is the first time we have published any of our gleanings from this particular source," referring to 'The Mudfog Papers'. He also suggests that "at some future period, we may venture to open the chronicles of Mudfog."
The 'Papers' were first published in book form as "The Mudfog Papers and Other Sketches" in 1880.

Hurst Reservoir

Hurst Reservoir is a disused reservoir near Glossop, north Derbyshire. In 1837, 50 local millowners and gentlemen, known as the "Glossop Commissioners", obtained an Act of Parliament to construct the Glossop Reservoirs. Hurst Reservoir was on the Hurst Brook and Mossy Lea Reservoir was to take water from the Shelf Brook. Only the Hurst Reservoir was constructed before the money ran out. Mossy Lea Reservoir was later constructed privately by the Duke of Norfolk. His engineer and surveyor was John Frederick Bateman. The reservoir was taken over in 1929 by the Glossop Corporation Waterworks. This became part of the Manchester Corporation Waterworks in 1959. Swineshaw Reservoir, Hurst Reservoir and Mossy Lea Reservoir are no longer in service.

Microfilaria

The microfilaria (plural microfilariae, sometimes abbreviated mf) is an early stage in the life cycle of certain parasitic nematodes in the family Onchocercidae. In these species, the adults live in a tissue or the circulatory system of vertebrates (the "definitive hosts"). They release microfilariae into the bloodstream of the vertebrate host. The microfilariae are taken up by blood-feeding arthropod vectors (the "intermediate hosts"). In the intermediate host the microfilariae develop into infective larvae that can be transmitted to a new vertebrate host.
The presence of microfilariae in the host bloodstream is called "microfilaraemia". The success of filariasis eradication programs is typically gauged by the reduction in numbers of circulating microfilariae in infested individuals within a geographic area.
Escaping the circulatory system.
All parasites need a mechanism for spreading to new individual hosts. Parasites in the lower gastrointestinal tract usually shed eggs in the host feces. Tissue-dwelling parasites, such as "Trichinella spiralis" (cause of trichinosis), rely on new hosts eating the tissues of their current host. For members of the family Onchocercidae whose adults live in the "closed" vertebrate circulatory system, transmission to a new host is achieved by the microfilaria stage, with the help of blood-feeding arthropod vectors.
This system is seen in the life cycle of "Elaeophora schneideri". The adults of "E. schneideri" typically reside in the carotid artery of its definitive host, the Mule deer. The female may be up to 12 cm (almost 5 inches) long, and releases microfilariae which measure 207 by 13 µm (or 0.008 by 0.00051 inches) into the bloodstream of the host. The blood flow carries the microfilariae away from the female in the carotid artery, and directly into the branching arteries of the head and face. Because of their size, the microfilariae pass easily through successively smaller vessles, becoming physically lodged in the small capillaries near the skin surface of the face and head.
Attracted by the carbon dioxide exhaled by the mule deer,[http://www.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef511.asp] the blood-feeding female horse fly often lands on the head or face to feed. The horse fly uses its scissor-like mouthparts to cut the surface of the skin, creating a pool of blood which it takes in through its sucking mouthparts. The microfilariae, which were just under the surface of the skin, are small enough to be ingested whole by the horse fly. Once inside the horse fly, the microfilariae bore through the stomach wall, and mature into infective larvae about two weeks later. These larvae migrate to the head and mouthparts of the horse fly, and enter the bloodstream of another vertebrate host when the horse fly feeds again.
Microfilaria as a developmental stage.
Most recent parasitology textbooks consider the microfilariae to be "pre-larvae or advanced embryos" which will develop into the first stage larvae (L1) in the arthropod vector (p. 364). Some consider them to be the first larval stage, such as "microfilariae; i.e. first larva (= L1)" (p. 361).
In either case, the microfilaria is the stage which develops from the egg. In most tissue-dwelling species the eggs hatch in the uterus of the female, and the "unsheathed" microfilariae are released. In most blood-dwelling species, embryonated eggs (or, microfilariae which are said to be "sheathed" in the envelope of the egg) are released; and they will only exsheath ("hatch") after being ingested by the arthropod intermediate host. All microfilariae burrow through the stomach wall after being eaten by the arthropod host, and develop into infective third stage (L3) larvae. 
Many of the organs of microfilariae are in a very early stage of development. For some species, the developmental fates of individual cells have been followed from the microfilaria stage to the adult worm. The microfilariae of many species undergo a development phase called the "sausage stage", becoming temporarily shorter and thicker, while the first-stage (L1) larval organs develop.
In some species of Onchocercidae, the release of microfilariae by the adult female is periodic - occurring daily at a particular time of the day or night. This timing increases the chance that they will be picked up by a blood-feeding arthropod vector, which are often more active at certain times of the day.

MARSA (aviation)

In United States aviation, MARSA designates the delegation of responsibility for separation of aircraft in flight to military authorities by civilian air traffic control authorities. MARSA is an acronym for "Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft."
MARSA procedures are used when military aircraft must operate in close proximity and with close coordination. Under such conditions, it may be impractical for standard civilian air traffic controllers to ensure safe separation of the aircraft. MARSA procedures delegate the separation responsibility temporarily to the military authority operating the flights, thereby relieving ATC of the separation workload. When operations in close proximity have concluded, the designated military authority relinquishes responsibility back to ATC, and normal ATC procedures resume.
Typical applications of MARSA procedures include military formation flights and in-flight refueling operations.
MARSA operations are defined by regulatory documents and agreements between civilian and military aviation authorities. MARSA operations are initiated under specific conditions and terminated under equally specific conditions, using precisely defined steps to formally transfer responsibility to and from military authorities.

Schönhardt polyhedron

In geometry, the Schönhardt polyhedron is the simplest non-convex polyhedron that cannot be triangulated into tetrahedra without adding new vertices. It is named after German mathematician Erich Schönhardt, who first described it in 1928.
Construction.
The Schönhardt polyhedron can be formed by two congruent equilateral triangles in two parallel planes, such that the line through the centers of the triangles is perpendicular to the planes. The two triangles should be twisted with respect to each other, so that they are neither translates of each other nor 180-degree reflections of each other.
The convex hull of these two triangles forms a convex polyhedron that is combinatorially equivalent to a regular octahedron; along with the triangle edges, it has six edges connecting the two triangles to each other, with two different lengths, and three interior diagonals. The Schönhardt polyhedron is formed by removing the longer of the three connecting edges, and replacing them by the three diagonals of the convex hull.
Alternatively, the Schönhardt polyhedron can be formed by removing three disjoint tetrahedra from this convex hull: each of the removed tetrahedra is the convex hull of four vertices from the two triangles, two from each triangle. This removal causes the longer of the three connecting edges to be replaced by three new edges with concave dihedral angles, forming a nonconvex polyhedron.
Properties.
The Schönhardt polyhedron is combinatorially equivalent to the regular octahedron: its vertices, edges, and faces can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the features of a regular octahedron. However, unlike the regular octahedron, three of its edges have concave dihedral angles, and these three edges form a perfect matching of the graph of the octahedron; this fact is sufficient to show that it cannot be triangulated.
The six vertices of the Schönhardt polyhedron can be used to form fifteen unordered pairs of vertices. Twelve of these fifteen pairs form edges of the polyhedron: there are six edges in the two equilateral triangle faces, and six edges connecting the two triangles. The remaining three edges form diagonals of the polyhedron, but lie entirely outside the polyhedron.
Impossibility of triangulation.
It is impossible to partition the Schönhardt polyhedron into tetrahedra whose vertices are vertices of the polyhedron. More strongly, there is no tetrahedron that lies entirely inside the Schönhardt polyhedron and has vertices of the polyhedron as its four vertices. For, among any four vertices of the Schönhardt polyhedron, at least one pair of vertices from these four vertices must be a diagonal of the polyhedron, which lies entirely outside the polyhedron.
Related constructions.
It was shown by that the Schönhardt polyhedron can be generalized to other polyhedra, combinatorially equivalent to antiprisms, that cannot be triangulated. These polyhedra are formed by connecting regular "k"-gons in two parallel planes, twisted with respect to each other, in such a way that "k" of the 2"k" edges that connect the two "k"-gons have concave dihedrals. Another polyhedron that cannot be triangulated is Jessen's icosahedron, combinatorially equivalent to a regular icosahedron.
In a different direction, constructed a polyhedron that shares with the Schönhardt polyhedron the property that it has no internal diagonals. The tetrahedron and the Császár polyhedron have no diagonals at all: every pair of vertices in these polyhedra forms an edge. It remains an open question whether there are any other polyhedra (with manifold boundary) without diagonals , although there exist non-manifold surfaces with no diagonals and any number of vertices greater than five .

R-11 Zemlya

The R-11 Zemlya, GRAU index 8A61 was a Soviet tactical ballistic missile. It is also known by its NATO reporting name SS-1 Scud-A. It was the first of several similar Soviet missiles to be given the reporting name Scud.
The R-11 originated from a 1951 requirement for a ballistic missile with similar performance to the German V-2 rocket, but half its size. With the Wasserfall, an anti-aircraft version of the V-2, as a model the R-11 was developed by engineer Victor Makeev, who was then working in OKB-1, headed by Sergey Korolyov. The two men disagreed over the propulsion of the missile, with Korolev favouring the use of liquid oxygen, while Makeev advocated the use of toxic, but storable fuel. Makeev's version, that first flew on 18 April 1953, was fitted with an Isayev engine using RP-1 and nitric acid as a propellant. On 13 December 1953, a production order was passed with SKB-385 in Zlatoust, a factory dedicated to producing long-range rockets. In June 1955, Makeev was appointed chief designer of the SKB-385 to oversee the programme and, in July, the R-11 was formally accepted into military service. The definitive R-11M, designed to carry a nuclear warhead, was accepted officially into service on 1 April 1958. The launch system received the GRAU index 8K11.
Like the V-2, the R-11 relied on inertial guidance, and its flight was controlled by four graphite vanes in the engine exhaust, that were active only while the motor was burning. The R-11M had a maximum range of 270 kilometres, but when carrying a nuclear warhead, this was reduced to 150 kilometres. At maximum range, it was found to have an average range error 1.19 kilometres and an azimuth error of 0.66 kilometres. It was used as a mobile nuclear strike vector, giving the Soviet Army the ability to hit European targets from forward areas. To give the system sufficient mobility on the battlefield, the R-11 was mounted on the chassis of an IS-2 tank, that became its first transporter erector launcher. The only payload was a nuclear warhead with an estimated yield of 50 kilotons. 
A naval variant, the R-11FM (SS-N-1 Scud-A) was first tested at Kapustin Yar in February 1955, and was first launched from a converted Project 611 (Zulu class) submarine in September of the same year. While the initial design was done by Korolev's OKB-1, the programme was transferred to Makeev's SKB-385 in August 1955. It became operational in 1959 as the D-1 launch system, the world's first submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), and was deployed onboard Project 611 and Project 629 (Golf Class) submarines, until its replacement by the R-13 in 1961 (SS-N-4) and the R-21 (SS-N-5) in 1963. During its service, 77 launches were conducted, of which 59 were successful. The success of the R-11FM established Makeev as the main designer of submarine-launched weapons for the Soviet military.

Iraicchi

Iraicchi (Tamil இறைச்சி "iṟaicci", literally, "flesh") is a technique of suggestion used in the classical Tamil poetic tradition, particularly akam poetry. 
Iraicchi is closely connected with the extensive descriptions of natural phenomena or objects that characterise classical Tamil poetry. The technique of iraicchi involves using these descriptions to create an implication, or suggestion, which differs from the plain meaning of the words. This implication flows from the conventionalised symbolic meanings which the natural objects described in the poem have. Readers familiar with the conventions of Tamil poetry can, therefore, perceive these meanings "reading between the lines".
Modern commentators disagree on the precise relationship of iraicchi with other literary techniques used in Tamil poetry. Some, such as Zvelebil, Nadarajah and Mariaselvam treat iraicchi as being synonymous with uṭaṉuṟai, which is one of five types of indirect metaphor discussed in the Tolkappiyam, an early text on grammar and poetics. Thus, according to them, iraicchi is an alternative to other literary techniques such as "uḷḷuṟai uvamam", and is therefore distinct from them. 
Other commentators, such as Selby, treat iraicchi as being the "goal" of these indirect metaphors. In Selby's interpretation, poets use descriptions of natural objects forming part of the landscape in which the poem is situated (the poem's "tiṇai") to generate implicit metaphors ("uḷḷuṟai"). These metaphors suggest an implied meaning ("iṟaicci") which goes beyond the plain meaning of the words of poem. This implied meaning conveys to the reader the emotion, feeling or mood ("meyppāṭu") which the characters of the poem experience. Thus "uḷḷuṟai uvamam" and other types of metaphors are, in this reading, simply ways of conveying iraicchi, rather than alternatives to it.
In either sense, iraicchi has some similarities with the technique of "dhvani" used in Sanskrit and Maharashtri poetry. Selby, however, points to important differences. Tamil poems are conventionalised, and the descriptions of nature used in them have a clear and rigid symbolism. A reader who is aware of the symbolic significance of the various natural objects described in the poem can easily understand the various levels of meaning contained in the poem. Dhvani, in contrast, lacks the structure of this type of convention and as a result is naturally polysemic, and the reader of poem requires the aid of commentators to fully understand its various levels of meaning. As a result, she argues, the process involved in the two systems are entirely different, as far as the reader is concerned.

Ramose and Hatnofer

Ramose was the father and Hatnofer the mother of Senenmut, one of the most important state officials under the reign of the Egyptian queen Hatshepsut in the 18th dynasty of Egypt's New Kingdom. The commoner origins of Ramose and the rise of his son Senemut were long considered to be prime examples of high social mobility in New Kingdom Egypt. For instance, almost nothing is known of Ramose's origins, but he seems to have been a man of modest means—anything from a tenant peasant or farmer, to an artisan or even a small landowner. When Ramose died he was a man aged 50–60 (based on the dental evidence). Hatnofer was an elderly lady, with grey or even white hair. They are believed to have been born at Armant, a town only ten miles (16 km) south of Thebes within Upper Egypt presumably during the reign of Ahmose I, the founder of Egypt's illustrious 18th dynasty.
Tomb of Ramose and Hatnofer.
Ramose is known from a few contemporary sources. He appears on the false door and likely, also on the chapel of Senenmut's TT71 tomb chapel. Ramose and Hatnofer's own tomb was not located far from the chapel (TT71) of his son Senemut. The tomb of Ramose contained his mummy as well as that of Hatnofer (Hatnefret), who was the wife of Ramose and mother of Senenmut. It was found intact by Wiliam Hayes and Ambrose Lansing of the Metropolitan Museum's Egyptian expedition in excavation work conducted under a hillside terrace at Sheikh Abd el-Qurna hill in Western Thebes during the 1935-1936 archaeological season. Ramose and Hatnofer were buried in the tomb along with six other anonymous poorly wrapped mummies (three women and three unknown children) who are assumed to be family members of the couple. Initially, Lansing and Hayes interpreted the 6 bodies as grisly evidence that Senenmut's family had been struck by a sudden tragedy:
Some Egyptologists believe that all burials in their tomb took place at the same time.
Moreover, the Metropolitan Museum archaeologists convincingly demonstrated that the personal possessions in the tomb chamber of Ramose and Hatnofer were Hatnofer's alone since their items were all appropriate for a woman. Of the mummies in the chamber, Hatnofer's alone:
These six other burials, all from the early 18th dynasty "were found in the loose scree of the hillside as well as deposits of hunting weapons and the coffins of a horse and an ape." Ramose and Hatnofer's tomb conveys a comparatively simple impression and was initially considered, by Egyptologists, as evidence for the humble personal origins of Ramose in particular. 
Ramose and Hatnofer's tomb is notable for featuring the earliest known date from Hatshepsut's reign. A collection of grave goods found in the tomb's chamber contained a single pottery jar or amphorae—which was stamped with the date 'Year 7'. Another jar from the same collection—which was discovered "in situ" by the Metropolitan Museum of Art expedition—was stamped with the seal of the 'God's Wife Hatshepsut' while two jars bore the seal of "The Good Goddess Maatkare". The dating of the amphorae, which had been "sealed into the [tomb's] burial chamber by the debris from Senenmut's own tomb," is certain and establishes that Hatshepsut was recognised by her subjects as the king of Egypt by Year 7 of her reign.
Differing interpretations for the background of Senenmut's parents.
Ramose only held the title and non-specific epithet of "zab" ('the worthy') in his tomb. The excavators of the tomb assumed, therefore, that Ramose was once only a simple farmer since "The Worthy" was "a polite but somewhat meaningless apellation invariably used for the respected dead." However, it is often noted in the archaeological evidence, that many high state officials including some viziers carried the title "zab" even if it was only a post-mortem reference to them. This title, therefore, states almost nothing about the social origins of Ramose. Since Senenmut was able to join the roughly 10% of Egypt's society who were educated and later won favour as Hatshepsut's chief architect, it seems highly unlikely that Ramose was a mere farmer; Ramose must have instead held a higher position in Egyptian society to enable his son to be literate. 
More remarkable, however, is the comparison of the funerals of Ramose with that of his wife Hatnofer. Hatnofer had a rich gilded funerary mask, heart scarab, canopic jars, papyri and "a selection of traditional grave goods suitable for a woman" donated for her interment. In contrast, Ramose's burial only featured his coffin. It is assumed that Hatnofer died when her son had already achieved his high state position under Hatshepsut; hence, the rich funerary goods must have been provided for by her influential son, Senenmut. In contrast, since Ramose was equipped with inferior funerary equipment, Senenmut's position in the Egyptian state was still comparatively minor when his father died. When Hatnofer died of old age between Year 6 or Year 7 of Hatshepsut, Senenmut was now wealthy enough to arrange to have his father Ramose resurrected from "his more lowly resting-place, hastily re-bandaged, placed in a painted anthropoid coffin and re-united with his wife" Hatnofer who had been more expensively mummified in their hillside tomb. 
The coffin of Ramose was fitted with gold which thereby implied some social status for him. The absence of an expected rock cut chapel in Ramose and Hatnofer's tomb is not surprising since few New Kingdom tombs featured such a chapel prior to the reign of Hatshepsut. By performing a more careful and critical examinination of the sources, it would appear that Ramose was perhaps already a minor official of the early 18th dynasty during his career. The ascent of his son to the highest public offices rests perfectly within the bounds of possibility of Ancient Egyptian society. However, Tyldesley stresses that:
Another option is that the tomb of Ramose was robbed shortly after his burial and that Ramose was reburied with his wife when she died. Again, this makes it hard to pinpoint any social background for Ramose and Senenmut, as it is impossible to make any statements about the quality of his original burial equipment as it is simple robbed.
Senenmut's mother Hatnofer—the daughter of a lady named Sitdjehuty—was herself simply identified as 'Mistress of the House', which was a very general title awarded to married women. When Hatnofer died, she was a short, at just over five feet tall, but somewhat stout lady of about 60 years old. Hatnofer was interred with several mirrors which were made of highly polished bronze or silver set into wood or metal handles as well as a bronze razor, which was found along with other cosmetic devices inside a basket in her tomb.

Leipzig-Dresden Railway

The Leipzig–Dresden line is a German railway line. It was built by the Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company between 1837 and 1839. It was the first long-distance railway and the first railway using only steam traction in Germany. It also included the first standard gauge rail tunnel in continental Europe.
History.
The line was built by the "Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company" (German: "Leipzig-Dresdner Eisenbahn-Compagnie") established by twelve businessmen in 1835. It was brought into operation in several stages:
On 7 April 1839, on the completion of the Elbe bridge at Riesa, the entire route from Leipzig to Dresden was finally opened. It included the 513 metre long Oberau Tunnel, the first standard gauge rail tunnel in continental Europe. It was preceded only by the Prince William Railway, a narrow-gauge plateway opened in 1831 and the Bavarian Ludwig Railway opened in 1835, which was a short line and was initially operated largely by horse-drawn trains, partly because it was located a long way from coal fields and no railways existed to convey coal to Nuremberg. In contrast the Leipzig–Dresden Railway used only steam traction from its beginning.
The Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company was nationalised in 1876 and became part of Royal Saxon State Railways. On 4 December 1915, the new unified Leipzig Hauptbahnhof (central station) opened; it including a Saxon section, which included the terminus of the line to Dresden.
After the First World War.
1 April 1920 were the "Royal Saxon State Railways" (recently renamed the "Saxon State Railway") were absorbed into the newly established German National Railways ("Deutsche Reichsbahn"). The Leipzig-Dresden line came under the administration of the "Dresden Reichsbahn Directorate".
From 1 July 1933 to July 1934 the Oberau Tunnel was opened up and turned into a cutting, because the tunnel was not wide enough as the loading gauges was increased. Previously the distance between the two tracks in the tunnel did not allow two trains to pass.
The line in the communist era.
In 1946 one of the two tracks was removed to provide the route as reparations to the Soviet Union. Even the previously four-track section between Coswig and Dresden-Neustadt was reduced to only one track. This meant that one of the most important main lines in Germany was reduced to only a fraction of its former performance. Temporarily trains were run one way from Leipzig and Dresden, while in the other direction they ran via Meissen and Döbeln.
In the early 1960s began the plans to electrify the route as part of the section Saxon triangle. In 1969 and 1970, the line was electrified and the second line was reinstalled throughout. The table below shows the dates of the completion of the electrification:
Rebuilding since 1990.
Soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the beginning of moves towards German reunification, a high-speed line was planned between Leipzig and Dresden. Initially this provided for a continuous new alignment, but those plans were later reduced to the extensive redevelopment of the existing line in order to save costs. The redevelopment of the line was in the 1992 Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan as a new project and included as German Unity Transport Project No. 9.
Work began in May 1993, on the rebuilding of the existing line between Weißig and Priestewitz and a, little later, on the section between Leipzig-Ost and Engelsdorf and on bridge work between Wurzen and Oschatz. In 1996 at Oschatz the first Electronic interlocking in Saxony was put into operation.
The total estimated cost of the project is €1,451 million (as at July 2008), of which €775 million had been spent by end of 2007.

Elle a les yeux revolver...

"Elle a les yeux revolver..." is a 1985 pop song recorded by French singer Marc Lavoine. It was the second single from his debut album "Marc Lavoine", and his third single overall. Released in May 1985, the song was a top four hit in France, becoming the singer's first successful single, and has remained to date one of Lavoine's signature songs.
Song information.
Written by Marc Lavoine and composed by Fabrice Aboulker, the song deals with a woman described in the lyrics as a femme fatale. The song is characterized by "a few notes of Far East color, violins that slightly give rhythm to the song, a warm and sensual voice".
The song was performed in a live version at the Olympia (Paris) and included on the 2003 "Olympia Deuxmilletrois" album. The song also appears on Lavoine's compilations "85-95", "Les Solos de Marc" and "La Collection de Marc". The singer re-recorded his song in a new version, more acoustic, on his 2001 studio album "Marc Lavoine" on which it is featured as a hidden track.
In France, the single entered the SNEP singles chart at #48 on May 18, 1985, then climbed quickly and finally hit #4 on July 13 and 27. It remained for 13 weeks in the top ten and totaled 25 weeks in the top 50. To date, the song is the 240th best-selling single of all time in France.
"Elle a les yeux revolver..." was notably covered in 1998 by British a cappella vocal group The Flying Pickets on its cover album "Vox Pop", on which it features as third track. This 3:40 version was just entitled "Les Yeux revolver". The song was also covered in 2003 by A La Recherche De La Nouvelle Star on its album "1ers Tubes".

Sequins 3

Sequins 3 is a limited edition extended play by Irish singer Róisín Murphy. It was released by Echo Records on 12-inch vinyl in April 2005.
Songs.
The opening track "If We're in Love" is a downtempo song featuring a boogie swing rhythm and sharp brass parts, opening with phased vocals and closing with a call and response between brass and keyboard parts. Following "Sinking Feeling", which uses a beat constructed from clicking sounds, is "Ramalama (Bang Bang)", which contains a chorus of onomatopoeic lyrics delivered over a tribal rhythm. The extended play closes with "The Closing of the Doors", a cabaret-style ballad driven by the piano.
Cover artwork.
The cover of "Sequins 3" was painted by Simon Henwood. Murphy met Henwood in a pub, and Henwood, who was known for his simplified paintings of teenagers, thought that she would be a good subject for a painting. Henwood came to Murphy's house the next week and, while they were looking through her wardrobe, decided to have her dressed in sequins. Murphy positioned her body in abstract shapes for Henwood to paint. She developed a character, which Henwood described as a "disco electro pop diva with a 1940s look". His canvases were displayed at The Hospital in Victoria, London, and Murphy purchased them "for kids so they can see what [she once looked like."

Saxon X V

The Royal Saxon State Railways designated four-coupled, "Atlantic" (4-4-2) express locomotives as Class X formula_1 and the Deutsche Reichsbahn subsequently grouped these locomotives into DRG Class 14.2 in 1925.
History.
In 1900 the Sächsische Maschinenfabrik engineering works built the first two express locomotives of the new four-coupled, "Atlantics" with a four-cylinder compound engine. One of the locomotives was displayed at the Paris World Exhibition in 1900 and was awarded the Grand Prix.
The Royal Saxon State Railways took over the two prize-winning locomotives and procured another 13 up to 1903 that differed from the prototypes, particularly in terms of the diameter of the carrying axles. They were the largest and most powerful locomotives in Saxony to that point. The X V was employed on express train duties on the plains where its riding qualities and economy were impressive.
In 1920 the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over all 15 engines and gave them the new numbers 14 201–215 in 1925. They were retired by 1926.
Technical features.
The locomotives had a boiler with a Belpaire firebox, which was located between the frame sides. Two injectors provided the boiler feedwater.
The steam engine was designed as a de Glehn four-cylinder compound. The outer high-pressure cylinders drove the second coupled axle, whilst the inside low-pressure cylinders drove the first. The motion for the engine was a Walschaerts valve gear on the outer cylinders and a Joy valve gear on the inner ones.
Braking for locomotive and train was provided by a Westinghouse compressed-air brake. On the two prototypes the air pump was on the right, on the remaining locomotives it was installed on the left hand side.
The coupled axles were fixed to the frame. The leading bogie was an Erfurt design, the trailing axle was an Adams axle.
The locomotives were coupled with Saxon tenders of classes sä 2'2' T 18, sä 2'2' T 19.5 and sä 2'2' T 21.
Service.
The locomotives were only in express train service on the Leipzig–Dresden railway for a few years before the four-coupled engines proved too underpowered for the steadily climbing train loads. The X V was then deployed mainly on the passenger trains from Dresden to Bodenbach, Leipzig and Zittau until its retirement.

I'm Ready (Bryan Adams song)

"I'm Ready" is a song by the Canadian rock musician Bryan Adams. It was written by Adams and collaborator Jim Vallance. The song was first released in 1979, by Ian Lloyd (formerly of The Stories), on his solo album "Goose Bumps". Vallance played the drums on this recording. In 1983 Adams himself recorded the song for his third album, "Cuts Like a Knife", as a straightforward rock song with electric guitar and synthesizer. Adams co-produced his version with Bob Clearmountain, who also mixed it.
The song became a hit for Adams in 1998, after its inclusion on his 1997 album "MTV Unplugged". Patrick Leonard was producing these sessions, and selected "I'm Ready" to be included in the show. For this concert, the song was re-arranged as an acoustic ballad with string orchestrations added by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked on some of Adams' biggest hits, and played by students of the Juilliard School. Furthermore it features a Low whistle played by Davy Spillane. In 1998 the song was released as the second single from the Unplugged album, after "Back to You". This version is also included on the two Best-of-compilations "The Best of Me" and "Anthology". 
Italian release.
In 2001, "I'm Ready" was re-released in Italy with new lyrics, now entitled "Io Vivo (In Te)". The new Italian lyrics were written by Zucchero Fornaciari. Zucchero also produced the new version, basically using the "Unplugged" recording, and recording new vocals on top of it (notice the audience and some of Bryan's original vocals still audible on the track). Also featured is additional percussion, added by Martyn Philips using Pro Tools. Philips, along with Randy Staub engineered "Io Vivo (In Te)"; the latter also mixing the track (originally mixed by Bob Clearmountain). The single uses the same picture and colour scheme as the original release of "I'm Ready", only using a different font.
Music video.
The music video was directed by Nigel Dick, although footage of the original performance was also shown on MTV, prior to the single being released.

Salem Airport (India)

Salem Airport ) is located in Kamalapuram, 15 Kilometres North-west of Salem, Tamil Nadu, India. It serves Salem city and the districts of Salem, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri. 
History.
Salem airport was constructed in April 1993 at a cost of Rs. 6 Crore covering a sprawling 136-acres extensively donated by local traders and industrialists. The airport was the first in the country built with the help of contributions from members of the public. A total of Rs. 49 lakh, including Rs. 30 lakh by Salem Steel Plant. Originally planned for Vayudoot services using small aircraft and conceived with a 1,350-metre runway, it was expanded by another 600 metres to accommodate bigger planes. Initially, NEPC Airlines operated flights on the Chennai-Salem-Coimbatore-Chennai sector using Fokker F-27 aircraft. however, the airline withdrew the service after three months citing ‘non-viability’ as its main reason. The Salem airport lay in disuse since then as no airline was willing to invest in this sector. Although the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had spruced up the airport and made it ready for operation, airlines did not show interest to fly fearing low patronage. In 2006, Air Deccan agreed to kickstart its Salem operations but only if the local industry deposited at least Rs 90 lakh or gave a commitment for 50% bookings. Meanwhile, Air Deccan merged with Kingfisher Airlines. 
After a 3 year wait and prolonged negotiations, Kingfisher airlines commenced daily flights to Chennai using its ATR aircraft on 15 November 2009. The service was withdrawn on 28 October 2011, again citing poor patronage.
Structure.
Salem Airport has one runway, oriented 040/220 degrees, 6000 feet long. Its 100 by 75 metre apron is capable of handling 2 ATR aircraft while its terminal building can cater to 100 passengers. Navigational facilities at Salem include VHF radio, PAPI and an NDB. 
Flight Training and Pilot Training Centres.
The excellent conditions prevailing at Salem Airport is highly suitable for flight Training. Salem Airport is now the hotspot for establishment of flight training and pilot training centres in southern India. Given the state of the art infrastructure available here, it is an ideal training airport and base for aspiring pilots. The reputed air charter operator based in Salem (Salem Air) has started pilot training services. Salem Aviation Services and the Salem Flying Club operate from Salem airport. Its already a home to two flying schools based at Salem.

R-17 Elbrus

The R-17 Elbrus, GRAU index 9K72 is a tactical ballistic missile, initially developed by the Soviet Union. It is also known by its NATO reporting name SS-1 Scud-B. It is one of several Soviet missiles to carry the reporting name Scud; the most prolifically launched of the series, with a production run estimated at 7,000 (1960–1987). Also designated R-300 during the 1970s, the R-17 was derived from the R-11 Zemlya. It has been operated by 32 countries and manufactured in four countries outside the Soviet Union. It is still in service with some.
The first mock-up was designed and built by Makeev in 1958–1959, before the programme was transferred to the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant in 1959 for mass production. The first launch was conducted in 1961, and it entered service in 1964.
The R-17 featured important improvements over the R-11. The Isayev RD-21 engine used a combination of inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) oxidiser and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) fuel, fed into the combustion chamber by fuel pumps that ensured a more consistent thrust. The guidance system, active only during the boosted phase, uses three gyroscopes, that give it a Circular Error of Probability (CEP) of 450m (900m according to western sources.) A nuclear warhead was designed for the R-17, with a selectable yield, from 5 to 70 kilotons. However it could also carry a chemical warhead, containing 555 kg of viscous VX; a conventional weapon, with a single high explosive warhead; or a series of fragmentation payloads, using either high explosive, anti-tank or anti-runway munitions.
At first, the R-17 was carried on a tracked TEL similar to that of the R-11, designated 2P19, but this was not very successful, as the vibration of the tracks had a tendency to interfere with the launch electronics. Production of this model was halted after Khrushchev cancelled the production of heavy tanks in 1962, and a wheeled launcher was designed by the Titan Central Design Bureau, becoming operational in 1967. The new MAZ-543 vehicle was officially designated 9P117 "Uragan", and its Russian crews nicknamed it "Kashalot" (sperm whale), because of its size. The eight-wheeled MAZ-543 has a loaded weight of 37,400 kg, a road speed of 55 km/h and a range of 650 km. It can carry out the launch sequence autonomously, but this is usually directed from a separate command vehicle. The missile is raised to a vertical position by means of hydraulically powered cranes, which usually takes four minutes, while the total sequence lasts about one hour.
It has been rumored that Scud-B's were fired by Gaddafi forces against rebels in the 2011 Libyan civil war during the first phase of the war. On 14 August 2011 a confirmed Scud-B launch was detected by a US Aegis destroyer, with the missile fired from Sirte and heading toward rebel positions in Ajdabiya. The missile fell 80 km off target in the middle of the desert, inflicting no damage. Eight days later, on August 22, three more Scud-B launches were detected by NATO.

Mossy Lea Reservoir is a disused reservoir near Glossop, north Derbyshire. In 1837, 50 local millowners and gentlemen, known as the "Glossop Commissioners", obtained an Act of Parliament to construct the Glossop Reservoirs. Hurst Reservoir was on the Hurst Brook and Mossy Lea Reservoir was to take water from the Shelf Brook. Only the Hurst Reservoir was constructed before the money ran out. Mossy Lea Reservoir was constructed privately in 1840 by the Duke of Norfolk. It was taken over in 1929 by the Glossop Corporation Waterworks. This became part of the Manchester Corporation Waterworks in 1959. Swineshaw Reservoir, Hurst Reservoir and Mossy Lea Reservoir are no longer in service.

Although a shape resembling Jessen's icosahedron can be formed by keeping the vertices of a regular icosahedron in their original positions and replacing certain pairs of equilateral-triangle faces by pairs of isosceles triangles, the resulting polyhedron does not have right-angled dihedrals. The vertices of Jessen's icosahedron are perturbed from these positions in order to give all the dihedrals right angles.

Hwasong-5

The Hwasong-5 (Korean: 화성 5호 Hanja: 火星 5號) is a North Korean tactical ballistic missile derived from the Soviet R-17 Elbrus missile. It is one of several missiles with the NATO reporting name Scud.
North Korea obtained its first R-17 missiles from Egypt in 1979 or 1980, in return for assistance during the Yom Kippur War. As relations with the Soviet Union were rather strained at the time, and Chinese assistance had proven unreliable, the North Koreans set about reverse engineering the Egyptian missiles. This process was accompanied by the construction of a missile-building infrastructure, of which the main elements were the 125 factory at Pyongyang, a research and development institute at Sanum-dong and the Musudan-ri Launch Facility.
The first missile prototypes were completed in 1984. Designated Hwasong-5, and known in the West as the "Scud Mod. A", they were identical to the R-17Es obtained from Egypt. The first test flights occurred in April 1984, but the first version saw only limited production, and no operational deployment, as its purpose was only to validate the production process. 
Production of the definitive version of the Hwasong-5 ("Scud Mod. B" or "Scud-B") began at a slow rate in 1985. The type incorporated several minor improvements over the original Soviet design. The range with a 1000 kilogram warhead was increased from 280 to 320 kilometres, and the Isayev engine was slightly modified. An array of payloads was developed, including high explosive (HE), cluster, chemical, and possibly biological warheads. Throughout the production cycle, until it was phased out in favour of the Hwasong-6 in 1989, the DPRK manufacturers are thought to have carried out small enhancements, in particular to the guidance system, but the exact details are unknown. 
In 1985, Iran acquired 90 to 100 Hwasong-5 missiles from North Korea in a deal worth US$500M. As part of the deal, North Korea agreed on a missile technology transfer, and it helped Iran establish a production line. In Iran, the Hwasong-5 was produced as the Shahab-1.

Reginald Sayre

Reginald Hall Sayre (October 15, 1859 – May 29, 1929) was a prominent American orthopedic surgeon and Olympic sport shooter.
Biography.
Sayre was born to Eliza Ann Hall, an artist, and Lewis Albert Sayre, the leading American orthopedic surgeon. He studied at the Churchill & Maury School and Columbia College, graduating in 1881. Two of his elder brothers went into medicine after the father, and thus Reginald initially thought to become a lawyer. However, his brother Lewis persuaded him to follow the family tradition and enter the Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1881. After graduation in 1884, he worked as an assistant to Hermann Biggs and then joined the practice of his brother Lewis. Later he began helping his father with teaching at a college.
Sayre started his research from early age and published most of his paper at young age. Just seven months after completing internship he presented before the New York Academy of Medicine a report on "The Immediate Restoration of Parts to the Normal Position after Tenotomy" where he boldly questioned well-accepted procedures. 
Though his life, Sayre mostly worked as surgeon at the Bellevue and St. Vincent's Hospitals. from 1899 and till his death he was Professor of Orthopedic Surgery at Bellevue, where he succeeding his father as head of the Orthopedic Department. He was also consulting surgeon at Hackensack (1891), Hospital for Crippled Children, Newark (1897), Mountainside, Montclair (1898), N. Y. State Orthopedic, West Haverstraw (1900), Englewood (1901), Hospital for Deformities (1908) and Flushing (1914). In 1917, he served as Division Surgeon, with rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and during World War I was in charge of orthopedic instruction to medical officers at the New York University. 
Sayre died suddenly, from myocardial degeneration. He was survived by a sister, Mary Jane. His two older brothers died in 1880 and 1890.
Memberships and recognition.
Sayre was a member of the New York Academy of Medicine for 42 years and held various administrative posts there:
He was also vice-president of the American Orthopedic Association (1891–1892), an honorary vice-president of the orthopedic section of the Pan-American Medical Congress (1893), vice-president of the New York Pathological Society and Emeritus Professor of the New York University (1928). Sayre co-founded The Society of Alumni of Bellevue Hospital and served as its president between 1902 and 1910. He was also a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, the American Medical and the American Orthopedic Associations, becoming president in 1904.
Sports.
Sayre had passion for sports, and while studying at Columbia College took part in athletics. He was also a member of the Varsity track team and once won the intercollegiate mile walk. Later in his life he enjoyed horse riding and owned several horses. He was also a life member of the New York Athletic Club. However, he was most skilled in pistol shooting, winning American championships and becoming the captain of the US Olympic Pistol Teams in 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics.
In 1908 he finished 21st in the individual pistol competition. In 1912, he became fourth in the team 30 metre military pistol competition; 13th in the 50 metre pistol event and 19th in the 25 metre rapid fire pistol competition.

<doc id="20347198" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20347198" title="Symphonies by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky">
Symphonies by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky struggled with sonata form, the primary Western principle for building large-scale musical structures since the middle of the 18th century. Traditional Russian treatment of melody, harmony and structure actually worked against sonata form's "modus operandi" of movement, growth and development. Russian music—the Russian creative mentality as a whole, in fact—functioned on the principle of stasis. Russian novels, plays and operas were written as collections of self-contained tableaux, with the plots proceeding from one set-piece to the next. Russian folk music operated along the same lines, with songs comprised as a series of self-contained melodic units repeated continually. Compared to this mindset, the precepts of sonata form probably seemed as alien as if they had arrived from the moon.
Sonata form also was not designed to accommodate the emotionally-charged statements that Tchaikovsky wanted to make. In this, he was far from alone—it was a major preoccupation of the Romantic age, to the point that the validity of the symphony was questioned seriously and alternatives to it were actually devised. These alternatives, which included program music in general and the symphonic poem in particular, did not offer a complete solution. Instead, they left Tchaikovsky facing a paradox. He reportedly did not care for program music, to the point of reproaching himself for writing the fantasy-overture "Romeo and Juliet". Yet the notion of writing symphonies as purely intellectual patterns of chords, rhythms and modulations was at least equally abhorrent. 
Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky attempted to adhere more closely at least to the manner of sonata form in his first three symphonies. They remain chronicles of his attempts to reconcile his training from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with the music he had heard all his life and his own innate penchant for melody. Both those factors worked against sonata form, not with it. With the Fourth Symphony, Tchaikovsky hit upon a solution he would refine in his remaining two numbered symphonies and his program symphony "Manfred"—one that would enable to reconcile the more personal, more dramatic and heightened emotional statements he wished to make with the classical structure of the symphony, showing, as musicologist Martin Cooper phrased it, that "his inspiration was stronger than scruple."
Scrutability over Tchaikovsky's work, however, has remained intense at times, especially among critics. The fact that Tchaikovsky did not follow sonata form strictly and instead amended it creatively has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what music critic Harold C. Schonberg termed "a professional reevaluation" of Tchaikovsky's work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely. More often than in the past, however, his approach is being viewed as innovative rather than evasive and an effective fusion of two dissimilar musical philosophies.
Russian versus Western.
Ideally, Tchaikovsky's training at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory would have thoroughly equipped him to work with European principles and forms of organizing musical material, just as immersion in those things might have helped him gain a sense of belonging to world culture. However, Tchaikovsky was still "Russian to the marrow," as he told his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, "saturating myself from earliest childhood with the inexplicable beauty of the characteristic traits of Russian folk song, so that I passionately love every manifestation of the Russian spirit." Native instincts that strong could drive him toward Russian musical principles, which in several ways worked in opposition to Western ones, and make his Russianness work as much against him as it did for him. The result was a continual struggle with Western sonata form, especially in dealing with the symphony. A major block for Tchaikovsky in this department, according to musicologist David Brown, may have been 
a cardinal flaw in the Russian character: inertia... In literature it produces the novel that proceeds as a succession of self-contained sections, even set-piece scenes...Indeed, such tableau organization is fundamental to the most Russian of operatic scenarios... he most characteristic Russian scenario is like a strip cartoon, each scene presenting a crucial incident or stage in the plot, leaving the spectator to supply in his imagination what has happened in the gaps between these incidents.
Brown lists several factors in Russian folk music which contribute to this pattern of inertia. Melodies in Russian folk songs are self-contained, with no interaction between themes in contrasting musical keys or any clear transition from one theme to another. Instead, melodies are repeated, "using similar intervals and phrases with an almost ritual insistence," according to musicologist John Warrack. This makes many folk songs essentially a series of variations on one basic shape or pattern of a few notes. The problem with repetition is that, even with a surface level of rhythmic activity added, the melody remains static over a period of time. Beneath that surface, nothing really moves or goes anywhere; the effect of the rhythm is decorative, not organic, because no true progress has taken place. 
Mikhail Glinka's "Kamarinskaya", which became famous as the first orchestral work based entirely on Russian folk song, is a case in point of the limits Russian composers faced and how they attempted to work around them. "Kamarinskaya" is based on two themes, a slow bridal song, "Izza gor" (From beyond the mountains), and the title song, a "naigrïsh". This second song is actually an instrumental dance played to an ostinato melody. This melody is repeated for as long as the dancers can move to it. Glinka begins with "Izza gor," then introduces "Kamarinskaya" as a contrasting theme. He uses a transition to return to the bridal song and show the contrast between the two themes. Another transition, this time using motifs from the bridal song, leads to the dance theme and the piece ends with the "Kamarinskaya" dance.
In a Western piece, after the first theme is introduced and harmony propels the music forward, it modulates to introduce a second theme in a contrasting musical key. The two themes then interact and the composition grows as an organic creation. Tension continues building as this thematic dialogue becomes increasingly complex. This dialogue or interchange eventually propels the piece to a climactic point of resolution. "Kamarinskaya" does not follow this pattern. Nor can it. The ostinato melody of the second song will not allow any motivic development without distorting the character of the piece. Glinka therefore uses the principle of repetition from folk song to allowing the musical structure to unfold. He repeats the theme 75 times, all the while varying the accompaniment—the instrumental timbres, harmonization and counterpoint—in a technique that Brown, Francis Maes and other musicologists call "changing backgrounds." By following this approach, Glinka preserves the original character of the dance and complements it with creative variations to sustain listener interest. However, because there is no thematic growth, the music remains static. It does not move forward as a Western piece of music would.
Simply adopting Germanic principles of formal musical organization was not going to solve the problem. Not only did Russian music refuse to cooperate with them but neither did the Russian creative mind. As Modest Mussorgsky phrased it, "The German, when he thinks, will first "examine" and "explore", then "make his conclusion:" our brother will first "make his conclusion", then amuse himself with examination and exploration." Tchaikovsky's exposure to and love of Russian folk-song, according to Cooper, "formed the background for all his other music experience, a subconscious musical atmosphere in which all other musical experiences were saturated," and Brown notes that Tchaikovsky's "natural ability to think in terms of organic symphonic procedures"—in other words, in the ability to "examine and explore, then make his conclusion"—"was certainly limited." The situation was not merely one of preoccupation with cause over effect, Brown writes, but also of an inability to connect cause with effect. "For just as it seems difficult for the Russian musical theorist to apply his active, controlled intelligence to the scrutiny of an imaginitive concept," he adds, "so it seems difficult for the Russian composer to harness his active, controlled intelligence to the unfolding of that imaginitive concept—as Bach had done so pre-eminently in the fugue, or the classical masters in the symphony."
Melody versus form.
Russian melody.
As large a challenge for Tchaikovsky as his Russian creative mentality was also his greatest compositional gift—namely, his own sense of melody. For him, however, the problem was two-fold. The first part stemmed, again, from his ethnic heritage. Brown points out that Tchaikovsky, like the majority of 19th-century Russian composers, was highly gifted melodically. However, even when those melodies were conceived with broad, multi-phrase structures, they tended to be even more self-contained than those in Russian folk songs, "thus requiring the composer to climb, as it were, a perimeter fence if he wanted to move on, perhaps to explore a new melodic field." This, Brown says, is again typical of Russian creativity, with a mindset of stasis rather than ongoing development.
"This problem of transition," Brown writes—of moving smoothly from one theme to another—"was one of the most vexed the Russian composer faced, greater in many ways than that of development." In European music, this is where modulation comes into play; you simply change from the musical key of your first theme to the contrasting but related key of your second theme. Modulation was a driving principle in both Western harmony and sonata form. It maintained harmonic interest over an extended time-scale, provided a clear contrast between musical themes and showed how those themes were related to each other. Western harmony was a study in motion; it propelled the music and, on a larger scale, gave it shape.
Remember that Russian creativity centered around inertia, not motion. This mindset, according to Brown, made harmony a potential trap for Tchaikovsky, as it was for many other Russian composers. He had to get his melodies to "go" somewhere, to have the ability to connect together instead of standing apart and separate. Tchaikovsky had already shown "a flair for harmony" that "astonished" Rudolph Kündinger, his music tutor during his time at the School of Jurisprudence, and a thorough knowledge should been part of his studies at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. However, Tchaikovsky would run into problems with modulation as soon as the opening theme of his First Symphony.
In the exposition portion of sonata form, where both musical themes are introduced, the first theme generally begins on the tonic, the key in which the composition is to be written, then ends in preparation to modulate toward the next relative key to connect with the second theme. This "fundamental move," as Brown phrases it, could prove the greatest degree of difficulty for a composer. In the best-handled examples from the Classical era, this move "is not just a modulation but a process of controlled tonal dynamism." Instead of being a preparation of this event, the opening theme of the First Symphony simply ends on the tonic, exactly where it began, and becomes a self-enclosed melody as per Russian practice. He reduces the transition to the second theme to a half-dozen bars in the dominant.
Romantic-age dilemma.
In the second of his two challenges with melody and sonata form, Tchaikovsky was very far from alone. Romantic composers on the whole were more focused on self–expression and the illustration of extra–musical content in their pieces than their Classical–age predecessors. Out of this concern came a widened palette of tone color, a greatly widened field of harmony and a similarly expanded development of orchestration. Most importantly, melody took on a new and very different significance than it had occupied with Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven. The themes the Romantics wrote, original in their own right, were now often seen as the reason for the compositions' existence. However, they were not the regular, symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with sonata form. This was why, musicologist Martin Cooper asserts, Romantic-age composers on the whole "were never natural symphonists." Even the efforts by Robert Schumann, Felix Mendelssohn and Johannes Brahms to return to the linear, architectural music of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven were attempts to fuse Classical and Romantic musical values. This worked most successfully in Brahms, Cooper explains, "because in him the violence and directness of emotional expression was somehow veiled and muted and therefore least apt to disturb the balance and proportion of the form."
The problem, Cooper emphasizes, was melody. Many of the themes that Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven used in their symphonies may not seem distinctive. Distinctiveness, however, was not the point. The point was what could be done with those themes—what pieces of musical architecture could be erected by using them. They were the compositional equivalent of cement blocks or bricks. Blocks and bricks, while not necessarily attractive, can work handily in constructing a house, a shop building or a cathedral. Just as those blocks fit together, the themes used by the Viennese masters, written in contrasting keys but related in harmony, contrasted, merged and grew into a musical structure larger and more intricate than any of those themes by themselves. Using the same analogy, imagine trying to build a wall or a building with polished marble statues. This is basically what the Romantic were producing, music-wise, with the themes they wrote. Statues do not work well as building blocks. They will not fit together. They stand apart and command attention instead of blending into the general scheme of things. Therefore, you will not get a well-built structure by using them.
Because more composers were trying to erect structures with statues instead of cement blocks, they started doubting whether the symphony was still a viable form. In other words, they were thinking in reverse to the rationale of the classical composers who had codified sonata form. They could not get the form to function with their themes as they wanted it to do, rather than refashioning their themes as Beethoven did, for example, to work within the form. According to musicologist Mark Evans Bonds, 
Even symphonies by well-known composers of the early 19th century as Méhul, Rossini, Cherubini, Hérold, Czerny, Clementi, Weber and Moscheles were perceived in their own time as standing in the symphonic shadow of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, or some combination of the three... [There was a growing sense that these works were aesthetically far inferior to Beethoven's... The real question was not so much whether symphonies could still be written, but whether the genre could continue to flourish and grow as it had over the previous half-century in the hands of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. On this count, there were varying degrees of skepticism but virtually no real optimism... Hector Berlioz was the only composer "able to grapple successfully with Beethoven's legacy."
Some Romantic composers worked around this problem by changing what they built. Instead of the musical equivalent of buildings, they constructed statue gardens—places which could showcase items depicting beauty and drama. These musical statue gardens, known as concert overtures worked as vehicles "within which to blend musical, narrative and pictoral ideas." Examples included Mendelssohn's overtures "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (1826) and "The Hebrides" (1830). Eventually, composers built bigger gardens, otherwise known as symphonic poems. In these new, looser and more flexible musical forms, large-scale orchestral writing could be combined with strong emotions and brilliant timbres to fulfill a wide range of extra-musical demands.
Theme or form first.
Tchaikovsky's opening entry for his diary of 1872 reads as follows:
Yesterday, on the road from Vorozhba to Kiev, music came singing and echoing through my head after a long interval of silence. A theme in embryo, in B-flat major, took possession of my mind and almost led me on to attempt a symphony. Suddenly the thought came over me to cast aside Stasov's not too successful "Tempest" and devote the summer to composing a symphony which should throw all my previous works in the shade.
This entry confirms that Tchaikovsky's priority in composition was a notable, complete melody, what musicologist John Warrack calls the "lyrical idea." With that melody might come the inspiration to use it in a symphony, concerto or other work. This was in reverse order to how Beethoven, Mozart and Haydn composed. For them, the process of building a symphony came before devising a suitable theme to use in it. This was the natural approach for composers for whom the mechanics of sonata form had become second nature. For Mozart, working out a movement or complete piece in this manner was an act in itself; notating that music became simply mechanical and he appreciated diversion while doing so. Beethoven, in contrast, wrestled mightily with his themes, adjusting them to fit the musical form he was going to use. For both men, form came first.
For Tchaikovsky, the symphony was a ready-made form into which he could place whatever theme he composed. The form itself came a distant second to the melody used in it. Composing in this manner would be akin to constructing a skyscraper without a firm blueprint. Doing so may have been one reason Tchaikovsky had such difficulty with sonata form. Another reason may have been that he was using complete, independent melodies, which by their very completeness could not be developed easily in the process of sonata form. As his friend and former pupil Sergei Taneyev points out, a composer like Tchaikovsky could modify such themes to generate tension, maintain interest and generally satisfy listeners, but all the composer was really doing was repeating them. He was not disassembling or combining or using them as structural elements. Tchaikovsky may have realized this dilemma for himself when he wrote, as an experienced composer of 48,
All my life I have been much troubled by my inability to grasp and manipulate form in music. I fought hard against this defect and can say with pride that I achieved some progress, but I shall end my days without ever having written anything that is perfect in form. What I write has always a mountain of padding: An experienced eye can detect the thread in my seams, and I can do nothing about it.
Note: Tchaikovsky talks about manipulating "the form", not the theme.
Early attempts.
Analyzing the symphonies of the Viennese masters was likely a given part of Tchaikovsky's curriculum at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Through it he apparently realized, as musicologist Ralph W. Wood points out, "that design is a crucial factor in music." He may have also "grasped that form and thematic material must be interdependent, every piece of material carrying the implication of its own self-dictated form." However, perhaps because of Tchaikovsky's own assumptions about emotion and music, he may have felt that he never solved or even confronted squarely the problem of form versus material. He idolized Mozart as a master of form, was aware of how his idol's symphonies functioned compared to his own and found his own lacking. Having clarity or security in how to solve those perceived challenges was another matter. While Tchaikovsky's earlier symphonies are considered optimistic and nationalistic (in other words, different from the music he would eventually write), they are also chronicles of his attempts to reconcile his conservatory training and study of the masters with the native musical traditions and innate lyricism that worked against what he had learned.
Symphony No. 1 "Winter Daydreams".
Tchaikovsky confessed to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, that while his First Symphony "is in many ways very immature, yet fundamentally it has more substance and is better than many of my other more mature works." This, Brown says, is extremely true. Its rich lyricism and Mendelssohnian charm and grace belie the fact that it drove its composer to a nervous breakdown while working on it. Tchaikovsky realized while composing it that, for him to grow as an artist, he needed to to work "around the rules" of sonata form to accommodate the music he was gifted to write. In doing so, Brown states, the composer would often show tremendous resourcefulness, even in this piece. "The opening stretch of the first movement," he writes, "is enough to scotch the hoary old legend that Tchaikovsky was devoid of any real symphonic aptitude."
Symphony No. 2 "Little Russian".
Here Tchaikovsky harnessed the harmonic, melodic and rhythmic quirks of Russian folk music to produce an opening movement massive in scale, intricate in structure and complex in texture—what Brown calls "one of the most solid structures Tchaikovsky ever fashioned"—and a finale that, with the folk song "The Crane" offered in an ever-dizzying series of backdrops, showcased how well he could mine the same vein as Glinka and the nationalist set of composers known collectively as The Five. Even so, Tchaikovsky was not satisfied. When he revised the work eight years after its premiere, he made a large cut in the finale and wrote a clearer, simpler first movement along Western lines. This is the version performed today. However, Tchaikovsky's friend and former student Sergei Taneyev considered the earlier one superior. His reputation as one of the finest craftsmen among Russian composers lends his opinion considerable weight.
Symphony No. 3 "Polish".
The Third Symphony is unique among Tchaikovsky's symphonies in musical key (the only one written in the major) and number of movements (five). Patterned after Schumann's "Rhenish" Symphony and possibly conceived with the notion of what that composer might write if he were Russian, the Third shows Tchaikovsky at what musicologist Hans Keller calls "his freest and most fluent so far." Academic movements rub shoulders with fanciful, dance-like ones not far removed from the composer's ballets (his first, "Swan Lake", was not far off the horizon) in the manner of the orchestral suites the composer would write between his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies. Some musicologists, Brown among them, brand the Third uneven in quality and inspiration. Others, including Dutch musicologist Francis Maes, consider it underrated. Maes points out its "high degree of motivic and polyphonic intricacies" and its "magic of sound ... combined with capricious rhythms and fanciful manipulation of musical forms."
Symphonic poem: alternative and catalyst.
While Tchaikovsky struggled with his first three symphonies, developments in Europe led to an alternative to this genre that, in a reverse twist, offered to change the scope of the symphony. Hungarian composer Franz Liszt desired a form of orchestral music that would offer greater flexibility in developing musical themes than the symphony then allowed but also preserve the overall unity of a musical composition. His objective was to expand single-movement works beyond the concert overture format. By doing so, he hoped to combine the dramatic, emotive and evocative qualities of concert overtures with the scale and musical complexity normally reserved for the opening movements of symphonies.
The fruit of Liszt's labors was what he eventually termed symphonic poems. In them, he used two alternatives to sonata form. Beethoven had used the first of these, cyclic form, to link separate movements thematically with one another. Liszt took this process one step further by combining themes into a single-movement cyclic structure. The second alternative, thematic transformation, originated with Haydn and Mozart. This process worked in a similar manner as variation but instead of a theme being changed into a related or subsidiary version of the main one, it becomes transformed into a related but separate, independent theme. Beethoven used it in the finale of his Ninth Symphony when he transformed the theme of the "Ode to Joy" into a Turkish march. Weber and Berlioz had also transformed themes. Schubert used thematic transformation to bind together the movements of his "Wanderer Fantasy", a work that had a tremendous influence on Liszt. However, Liszt learned to create longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation. 
Liszt's approach to musical form in his symphonic poems was also unorthodox. Instead of following a strict presentation and development of musical themes as in sonata form, he placed his themes into a loose, episodic pattern. There, recurring melodies called motifs were thematically transformed as musical and programmatic needs dictated. (Richard Wagner would make good use of this practice in his operas and music dramas.) Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, were foreshortened. Codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, were greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffled into new and unexpected patterns of order and three- or four-movement structures were rolled into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.
A number of composers, especially Bohemian and Russian, followed in Liszt's footsteps to develop the symphonic poem further. Added to this was the Russian love of story-telling, for which the genre seemed expressly tailored. Tchaikovsky wrote a symphonic poem, "Fatum", after he had finished his First Symphony and first opera, "The Voyevoda". There, he dabbled with the free form the new genre offered. However, the work did not come out well and he destroyed it after two performances. For his next programmatic work, the fantasy-overture "Romeo and Juliet", Tchaikovsky reverted to sonata form, structuring it in a similar fashion to Beethoven's concert overtures. However, in a case of musical cross-pollination, the symphonic poem offered the potential to change the nature of the symphony in its merging of a wide emotional range with symphonic resources. This potential played to the conception Tchaikovsky would form of the symphony as a vehicle for personal expression and one whose details could, as he phrased it to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, "be manipulated as freely as one chooses."
Program music, lyrical form.
Tchaikovsky's view of program music was ambivalent. He disliked the genre personally but generally needed some sort of subject upon which to write. Whether that catylist was a literary source, an overt program or a more subjective one based on an abstract theme such as love or fate did not necessarily matter. He needed something to fire his imagination and get his creative juices flowing. One indisputable fact was that Tchaikovsky had a flair for the genre. When he was caught up in the drama or the emotional states of the characters, as in "Romeo and Juliet", the results could be spectacular. When the work became difficult, as it would when he worked on the "Manfred" symphony, he became discouraged and complained that writing to a program was unpleasant and it was easier to do so without one.
In a letter to von Meck dated December 5, 1878, Tchaikovsky outlined two kinds of inspiration that would inspire a symphonic composer, a subjective and an objective one:
In the first instance, composer uses his music to express his own feelings, joys, sufferings; in short, like a lyric poet he pours out, so to speak, his own soul. In this instance, a program is not only not necessary but even impossible. But it is another matter when a musician, reading a poetic work or struck by a scene in nature, wishes to express in musical form that subject that has kindled his inspiration. Here a program is essential... Program music can and must exist, just as it is impossible to demand that literature make do without the epic element and limit itself to lyricism alone.
Writing to a program, then, was apparently a matter of course for Tchaikovsky. Technically, for him, every piece of music could contain a program. The difference for him lay in the explicitness or implicitness of the program itself. A symphony generally followed the lines of an implicit program, while a symphonic poem followed an explicit one. This also meant that, technically, any alternatives or amendments to sonata form used to underline either specific events or the general tone of a literary program in a symphonic poem could also be used to illustrate the "feelings, joys, sufferings" conveyed in a symphony; the only difference was in the type of program being illustrated. In fact, Brown claims, there is a considerable amount of Tchaikovsky's symphonic manner contained in the symphonic poem "Francesca da Rimini", which the composer wrote not long before the Fourth Symphony. The Allegro vivo section where the composer evokes the storm and whirlwind in the underworld is much like the first subject section of a Tchaikovsky symphony, while Francesca's theme in A major takes the place of a second subject.
Also, Tchaikovsky was apparently expanding his conception of the symphony from one where Germanic models were to be followed slavishly to a looser, more flexible alternative more in keeping with the symphonic poem. Sonata form, according to Wood, was never intended to be a musical straitjacket but, rather, to leave the composer "innumerable choices for building up a coherent movement" that would offer variety and, "by the relationships of its successive thematic elements and the management of its transitions ... have the appearance of organic growth." The problem for Tchaikovsky, however, was whether "organic growth" was even an option in building a large-scale piece of music. He wrote to von Meck, after he had written the Fourth Symphony,
You ask if I keep to established forms. Yes and no. There are certain kinds of compositions which imply the use of familiar forms, for example "symphony". Here I keep in general outline to the usual traditional forms, but only in general outline, i.e. the sequence of the work's movements. The details can be treated very freely, if this is demanded by the development of the ideas. For instance, in "our" symphony the first movement is written with very marked digressions. The second subject, which should be in the relative major, is minor and remote. In the recapitulation of the main part of the movement the second subject does not appear at all, etc. The finale, too, is made up of a whole row of derivations from individual forms...
Cooper suggests that for Tchaikovsky the symphony had become "a form, a convenience, no longer the natural, instinctive channel for his musical imagination" that it could or should have been had he followed strict Germanic practices. Even if this could have been the case with Tchaikovsky, the path would have been difficult. Cooper explains "that lyrical emotion should find its natural expression in sonata form is perhaps not unthinkable, but only if that form is so natural to a composer, both by instinct and habit, that it has come to be really an acquired instinct, a 'second nature,' as we say; and this was certainly never true of Tchaikovsky." Brown writes that while Tchaikovsky "was not without a certain measure of the true symphonist's gift for organic thematic growth," he concurs that for him "to create the sort of complex organic experience" that would allow him to meld lyric expression with sonata form "lay beyond his abilities." 
Nor, again, was this solely Tchaikovsky's dilemma. "The Romantics were never natural symphonists," Cooper writes, for basically the same reason as Tchaikovsky—"because music was to them primarily evocative and biographical—generally autobiographical—and the dramatic phrase, the highly melody and the 'atmospheric' harmony which they loved are in direct opposition to the nature of the symphony, which is primarily an architectural form."
Juxtaposition.
Two breakthroughs which, according to Brown, Austrian musicologist Hans Keller, Dutch musicologist Francis Maes and Soviet musicologist Daniel Zhitomirsky, came to Tchaikovsky while composing his Fourth Symphony, worked hand-in-hand in giving him a workable solution to building large-scale forms. The first answer was essentially to sidestep thematic interaction and keep sonata form only as an "outline," as Zhitomirsky phrases it, containing two contrasting themes. Within this outline, the focus now centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition. Instead of offering what Brown calls "a rich and well-ordered argument," Tchaikovsky integrates what Keller calls "new and violent contrasts" between musical themes, keys and harmonies by placing blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another. These blocks, Zhitomirsky explains, are demarcated by their distinct contrast in musical material and "by the fact that each theme in them usually constitutes an independent and structurally complete episode." The block containing the main theme, Zhitomirsky writes, alternates with the one containing the second theme. The former, he continues, is "steadily enlivened in reiteration" by what Warrack calls "ostinato figures, dramatic pedal–points, sequences that screw anticipation to a fever pitch with each new step, all expressed in frenzied rhythmic activity." The result of this enlivening, Zhitomirsky says, is "that the very contrast of the two blocks is consistently sharpened." 
An important part of this process, Keller states, is that "thematic and harmonic contrasts" are "not allowed to coincide." Mozart, he writes, evidently preceded Tchaikovsky in this tactic of modulatory delay and may have helped give Tchaikovsky the impetus in attempting it himself, although Tchaikovsky develops this form of contrast "on an unprecedented scale." Keller offers the second theme in the first movement of the Fourth Symphony as an example of how this process works. In sonata form, he writes, the first subject enters in the tonic and the second subject follows in a contrasting but related key harmonically. Tension occurs when the music (and the listener with it) is pulled away from the tonic. Tchaikovsky "not only increases the contrasts between the themes on the one hand and the keys on the other," but ups the ante by introducing his second theme in a key unrelated to the first theme and delaying the transition to the expected key. In the first movement of the Fourth Symphony, Tchaikovsky introduces the second theme in A-flat minor. Since the symphony is written in the key of F minor, the second theme should go either to the relative major (A-flat major) or the dominant (C minor). By the time Tchaikovsky establishes the relative major, this theme has finished playing. Thus, Keller says, "the "thematic" second subject precedes the "harmonic" second subject" (italics Keller).
This process, according to Brown and Keller, builds momentum and adds intense drama. While the result, Warrack charges, is still "an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them" in the Germanic sense, Brown counters that it took the listener of the period "through a succession of often highly charged sections which "added up" to a radically new kind of symphonic experience" (italics Brown), one that functioned not on the basis of summation, as Austro-German symphonies did, but on one of accumulation.
Within this overall concept of juxtaposition, Tchaikovsky employed his second solution. While Maes calls this answer a "structure" and Zhitomirsky an "independent and structurally complete episode," it could actually be described as a system in which melody, harmony, rhythm and tone color become interrelated elements functioning together like the working parts of a clock, each part moving independently but also as part of an overall action serving one purpose. With a clock, that purpose is indicating the time. With a symphony of the kind Tchaikovsky strove to craft, that purpose is two–fold: to resolve the overall tonal and emotional conflict introduced at the beginning of the work and to relieve the tensions produced as a by-product of that conflict, which keep the listener's attention as that conflict progresses. This systematic grouping of normally independent elements may have been a natural outgrowth of Tchaikovsky's creative process, as he mentioned to von Meck:
I write my sketches on the first piece of paper that comes to hand, sometimes a scrap of writing paper, and I write in very abbreviated form. The melody never appears in my head without its attendant harmony. In general, these two musical elements, together with the rhythm, cannot be conceived separately: every melodic idea carries its own inevitable harmony and rhythm. If the harmonies are very complicated, one must indicate the part-writing on the sketch... Concerning instrumentation, if one is composing for orchestra, the musical idea carries with it the proper instrumentation for its expression.
By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building "into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity," as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place. Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement.
The crux of the drama in this movement, Maes continues, comes musically from the rhythmic conflict between the opening motif and the first theme. At the same time, a dramatic conflict is played out between the dramatic nature of these two themes. "The motto uses the rhythm of the polonaise ... in its provocative and aggressive aspect. The first theme is marked, "in movimento di valse": a waltz expressing sentiment and vulnerability." Tchaikovsky initially allows these two elements to peacefully contrast against each other. In the development section, where Western composers in the past had combined their themes by variation and transformation before restating them, Tchaikovsky throws his themes together essentially unchanged to clash "remorselessly." In the movement's coda, he changes the note values of the waltz "so that the structure of the polonaise and the first two thematic elements become fused."
Later efforts.
Symphony No. 4.
Brown calls the Fourth Symphony a breakthrough work in terms of emotional depth and complexity, particularly in its very large opening movement. Although the composer himself complained about the formal "contrivances" and "artificiality" present there, Warrack maintains that in this symphony, Tchaikovsky found "the symphonic method that matched his temperament to his talents." The composer wrote von Meck that the symphony was patterned after Beethoven's Fifth in its use of an opening motif. The sheer violence with which this theme intrudes into various sections of the opening movement makes the fact it symbolizes Fate, to Brown, "wholly credible." At the same time, its use as a "structural marker" to hold this movement together, as noticed by Keller and music critic Michael Steinberg, shows it to have a musical as well as a dramatic function.
Manfred Symphony.
"Manfred", written between the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, is also a major piece, as well as a demanding one. The music is often very tough, according to Brown. The first movement, which Zhitomirsky calls "profound in emotional and psychological import" and "closest of all to Tchaikovsky's creative temperament," is "completely original in form," according to Brown; here the composer all but abandons sonata form completely. The various musical challenges poses for the other movements, Zhitomirsky says, are "brilliantly coped with." Brown points out the second movement as a highlight, diaphanous and seemingly unsubstantial but absolutely right for the program it illustrates. Maes calls "Manfred" Tchaikovsky's "most romantic work. No other work is close to Berlioz, Liszt and—in sonority—Wagner." He also cites the work's "high quality" and "epic scope ... developed with the help of striking sound pictures." Warrack suggests that, of all Tchaikovsky's major neglected works, "Manfred" may be the one which least deserves this fate.
Symphony No. 5.
"Both in idea and exposition," Zhitomirsky writes, the Fifth Symphony is "a variation on the concept of the Fourth" but "is embodied with even greater unity and scope" than its predecessor, more even in its "expressive balance," according to Brown, more symmetrical in form and orthodox in its tonal progressions. Warrack calls Tchaikovsky's use of what he calls the "Providence" theme "both characteristic and ingenious" and "of a very different order from the battering brass motive associated with Fate in the Fourth Symphony." Maes adds that, through the use of this theme in all four movements, Tchaikovsky achieved "greater thematic cohesion" than in the Fourth. Only the finale remains, in Warrack's words, "unconvincing" and "too easy." Maes agrees on the finale's "hollow rhetoric" and quotes musicologist Edward Garden as saying the same. Brown says it "fatally mars a splendid symphony which earlier demonstrated how convincingly Tchaikovsky could now create a large–scale symphonic work of complete technical assurance and structural equilibrium, yet wholly his own in expression."
Symphony No. 6 "Pathétique".
The Pathétique, which John Warrack calls "a symphony of defeat" and the composer's brother Modest an attempt "to exorcise and drive out the sombre demons that had so long plagued him," is a work of prodigious originality and power; to Brown, this symphony is perhaps one of Tchaikovsky's most consistent and perfectly composed works. Maes claims this work "demonstrates most clearly" that Tchaikovsky treated the symphony as a general form not to be strictly followed. This holds most true, he says, with the slow finale, marked Adagio lamentoso, ending on a note of complete resignation in the basses—the first time a composer had dared to do so—while the opening movement "is more emotionally balanced than the reputation of the symphony would lead one to suppose."
Conclusions.
Cooper maintains that if Tchaikovsky's symphonies were to be judged on strictly academic terms—in other words, on the same level as their Austro–German contemporaries and predecessors—they might "be considered fine music but poor symphonies." This line of thought, he maintains, is like architecture critics who believe that, "because no more beautiful and satisfactory churches than the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages have been built since, therefore all churches should be built in the Gothic Style." 
However, Cooper suggests, if they were to be "judged as a hybrid species" of symphony and symphonic poem, with inner workings more flexible and varied than sonata form might allow inhabiting the general four–movement structure to accommodate the musical and extra–musical demands sought not just by Tchaikovsky but also a number of other Romantic–age composers, they could be considered "completely successful." This, again in architectural terms, would be like when Gothic style was combined with the ideals of the Renaissance and the Counter-Reformation and a genuinely new style, the Baroque, resulted, "an organic development from the Gothic but as different in individuality as a child from its father." Soviet musicologist Boris Asafyev, in fact, calls the Tchaikovsky symphonies "dramatic" as opposed to the "non–dramatic" symphonies of Franz Schubert and Alexander Glazunov, as though he is discussing, if not two entirely different genres, then two separate variations on a common form.
Brown delineates the issue along cultural as well as formal lines. Russian symphonies are not German symphonies, he maintains, and the fact they may function along different parameters than their German counterparts does not make them any less valid on a musical or experiential level. Critics and musicologists agree universally that Tchaikovsky was not able to manipulate sonata form along the lines of a Mozart or Beethoven. This was a fact the composer himself bemoaned on more than one occasion. Though he received a Western European–style musical education, he still faced a native set of musical rules and traditions that did not conform at all to Western ones. Rather than ignore his native music and look Westward as his teacher Anton Rubinstein had done or forgo the West as much as possible as The Five did, he chose to face the problem from both sides head–on. 
The truth is, Wood writes, despite the composer's occasional self-indictments, Tchaikovsky did master "form" as he actually understood and could manage it from a compositional level. Warrack calls Tchaikovsky's solution to large-scale composition "a compromise with sonata form." Wood maintains that what the composer called his "mountains of padding" were simply inseparable from his initial conceptions—from his process of starting with an extra-musical program and from there deducing musical motives of widely divergent moods and character to be somehow worked into one movement. The alternative method was allowing his second theme to arise after and at the same time from the first, may have never occurred to him. However, it may have been equally likely that Tchaikovsky's compositional method never occurred to Mozart.
While Tchaikovsky may have been incapable of writing absolute music, his real challenge was that while he was conscious of his formal shortcomings and continued striving for an unreached perfection, his actual ideal never really changed. Because the ideal never changed, the problems to which Tchaikovsky addressed himself never really changed, either. In this sense, it could be argued that he never really grew or matured. Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky discovered a method by which to circumvent what he perceived as formal shortcomings and put his emotional life to work in large-scale abstract structures.

Cramond Lioness

The Cramond lioness is a Roman-era sculpture recovered in 1997 from the mouth of the River Almond at Cramond, Edinburgh, Scotland.
It depicts a bound male prisoner being killed by a lioness. The upper torso and head of the prisoner are shown, with the giant lioness behind him, sinking her teeth into his skull.
The work is interpreted as a Roman sculpture imported to Scotland to serve as part of the tomb of a Roman military commander or dignitary, and connected to the nearby Cramond Roman Fort. The location of such a tomb, and how the sculpture reached its location in the river are unknown.
The sculpture is presently housed at the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. In 2003, plans were unveiled for the lioness to be housed in a new archaeological centre at the Roman Fort in Cramond, although this proposal was still at the initial planning stage in 2008.

Matthau Mikojan

Matthau Mikojan (born Matti Mikkonen, March 26, 1982 in Tampere) is a Finnish rock musician, singer, guitarist and songwriter in a band named after him. In addition, he has thrown some gigs with a Finnish rock band called Black Jezus but he is not an official member of it. Instead, he plays guitar in another Finnish rock band named Don Skorleone & Consiglieres.
Life.
Matthau Mikojan was born on March 26, 1982 in Tampere. He's the younger son of "Arvo Tapani "Arwo" Mikkonen" who played guitar in the famous "manserock" band Popeda. About his mother "Sirpa", there is quite no information to find, therefore a lot more about his brother "Jukka Kristian Mikkonen", rather known as Sir Christus, ex-lead guitarist of the Glam-Rock band Negative from Tampere.
At the age of four, Matthau lost his father who died of a heart attack during a rehearsal with his band. Nevertheless, Matthau says that the musical work of his father shaped him a lot and that already in early childhood, he could not imagine anything else than becoming a rock musician.
Matthau has suffered from Tourette's syndrome since a ten year old and he also needs medication due to this. He was also in a clinical treatment in his childhood, but after a few weeks he decided to discontinue.
In addition, he said in an interview that he had some problems with alcohol for a time of three years.
Musical development.
Early beginnings.
Already in his very early childhood, Matthau started playing guitar. Besides this, he also can play bass guitar, drums and a bit piano and is learning to play the harmonica. His first acoustic appearance was, following the information given by himself, already in the year 1995. One year before, in 1994, he founded a band together with "Paavo Pekkonen". The band was first named "Turmio", then "RIP" and got finally known under the name Bloodpit. Besides, Matthau also played and sang in other bands such as "Lavasäteily" (for a certain time together with his brother), "Shit Kickers" or "SBT-666".
Bloodpit.
Finally, Bloodpit is the band which he concentrates on. The first appearance of the band takes place in Tampere on November 26, 1999. In the following years, the band goes through several line-up changes, especially the bass players do not stay very long. Besides this, the band had to get along without a label until 2004, releases several self-produced EPs for promotional reasons and participates in several band competitions of which, alone in 2001, they win three in a row. The competitions are followed by several appearances on different festivals and finally the band is offered a contract by "Grotesque Records", but the label is broke before the band agrees. Finally Bloodpit get to sign a contract with "Beemvees/Playground Music" in 2004 and release the albums "Mental Circus" (2005) and "Off The Hook" (2007) as well as diverse singles and EPs with them. The releases are followed by live appearances in Finland, Russia, Italy, the USA and Germany. The single "Platitude" from the album "Mental Circus" is decided to be one of the title tracks of the computer game NHL 07 from the American software company EA Sports in the end of 2006.
But on July 20, 2007, Matthau closes the chapter „Bloodpit“. During the tour, there appear discrepancies among the band and Matthau finally decides to leave Bloodpit „for personal reasons“, as it is to read later. The band takes a break after this and presents itself with a new line-up in summer 2008.
Matthau Mikojan (Band/project).
Already quite a short time after breaking up with Bloodpit, in September 2007, Matthau Mikojan starts recording his first solo album which is released on March 12, 2008 in Finland. On February 6, there is already a pre-release for the single "Stiletto Heels". On the album named after the artist, Matthau plays almost all instruments himself, except for the drums played by another musician, "Simo Stenman (The Bitterlicks)". Matthau's live band's line-up causes furore because until April 2008, it also included his brother "Sir Christus", who had left his long-time band "Negative" in January 2008. Also in the video for Matthau's second single "Too Fortunate To Cry", the brothers appear together, but then "Sir Christus" leaves the band with no drama involved. Matthau plays sundry gigs and festivals in Finland with his live-line-up, they are followed by the "Schraubelocker Tour" through Germany and Switzerland. After having finished the tour, Matthau announces on his homepage that his live-line-up will not only be a live-line-up anymore, but that the name "Matthau Mikojan" means from now on a band with the following line-up:
One month after having finished the tour, the EP "Chasing Ghosts" is released. It's the first release of Matthau Mikojan as a three-piece.
On 5 February 2009, Rokker Production's short documentary named "Koti, kellari ja kuppila" (in English "Home, loft and bar") has its premiere.

Mitra idae

Mitra idae, common name Ida's miter, is a species of medium-sized sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mitridae, the miters. 
Distribution.
This miter lives from Northern California, United States, to Baja California, Mexico.
Description.
The shell of this species is strong and heavy. The shells of adults vary from 20 to 60 mm in length. There are three folds on the columella. 
The shell itself is a pinkish-tan color, but in life the shell is covered in a strong black periostracum. 
The body of the animal is all pure white other than its black eye spots.
Life habits.
This miter lays egg capsules attached to rock surfaces. They are yellow or transparent, and about 8mm high. In laboratory conditions, females have been observed depositing over 90 egg capsules in 4 days, and 173 in 17 days. Each capsule contains hundreds of 0.2mm eggs. Veliger larvae hatch from the capsule after ~24 days, depending on temperature.
The species is a specialized carnivore, and can live for weeks without food.

John Kyparissiotes

John Kyparissiotes or Cyparissiotes (; c. 1310 - 1378/79), called “the Wise” by his contemporaries, was a Byzantine theologian and the leading Anti-Palamite writer in the period that followed the deaths of Nikephoros Gregoras (c. 1360) and of Palamas himself (14 September 1359). Of all the fourteenth-century opponents of Gregory Palamas, he was the most systematic theologian, and perhaps the ablest. Most of his works remain in original manuscripts, unedited; none has ever appeared in translation in a modern language. Although editions of some of his works have been made since the 1950s, most of them, published in small printings in Greece, are nearly as difficult to come by in the West as the original manuscripts themselves.
Life.
Few facts about Kyparissiotes’ life are known. The Kyparissiotes family name appears in Byzantine records occasionally from the tenth century onwards. It points to a family origin in Kyparissia, a town on the southwest coast of the Peloponnesus; whether John Kyparissiotes was born there, however, or at Constantinople, or at some other location, remains uncertain. The level of sophistication of his writings suggests that, wherever he was born, he was educated in the Byzantine capital. By 1342 at the latest he had sided with the opponents of Palamas in the religious controversy over Hesychasm that was then dividing Byzantine society and exacerbating a civil war. He may have belonged to the circle of scholars who frequented the house of Nikephoros Gregoras; he speaks of him with great respect, and is our sole source for the information that, after Gregoras’s death, the Palamites dragged his dead body through the streets. Other acquaintances included Demetrios Kydones, the prime minister to John VI Kantakouzenos and John V Palaiologos and translator of Aquinas.
In the renewed persecution of Antipalamites that followed the condemnation of Demetrios Kydones’ brother, the monk Prochoros, in 1368, Kyparissiotes found it necessary to flee the country. In 1371 he was living in Cyprus, as is testified by a letter from Demetrios Kydones (ep. 35). From there, he headed further west; records indicate that he travelled with the court of Pope Gregory XI during the latter’s journey from Avignon to Rome (9 November 1376 - 12 December 1377), and received from him a monthly pension. By then, he must have become a Roman Catholic. It is possible, though not certain, that Kyparissiotes is the “good John” of whom Kydones, in another letter (ep. 130), speaks as having returned to Constantinople (1378/79). If so, that would be the last piece of information we have about him.
Writings.
We possess from Kyparissiotes’ pen two major writings, and a number of minor ones. His two most important works are the "Decades", on the one hand, and "Against the Heresy of the Palamites", on the other. The latter work is a gigantic polemical treatise in five parts, most of which still remains unedited. Of its first part, titled "On the Crimes of the Palamites", books 1 and 4 have been published (Migne, PG 152, 664-737, which reprints the 1672 edition of Combefis). Part five of the larger work is a detailed refutation of the "Concise Treatise" of Nilos Kabasilas, and consists of five books. Kyparissiotes' point in this work, as elsewhere, is to defend divine simplicity; he argues that there is no middle term between the uncreated and the created, and that whatever is uncreated must be really identical with the one divine nature. The text of this work was edited by Dr. Stavros Maragoudaki and published in Athens in 1985.
As for the "Decades" — or, to give it its proper title, the "Elementary Exposition of Theological Texts" () — it is a less overtly polemical work, although it too is ultimately concerned with refuting the Palamite theology. It is organized into ten parts, each part being further divided into ten chapters (hence the alternative title). Albert Ehrhard characterized this work as “the first attempt at a systematic Dogmatics in the manner of Western scholasticism.” He goes on to speak of it in the following way:
“Like the Scholastics, John begins with a setting forth of axioms, definitions, and classifications of theology (in the sense of the Doctrine of God). He distinguishes between a mystical and a demonstrative theology; demonstrative theology is further divided into affirmative and negative. Affirmative theology deals with the divine emanations and names, negative theology with God’s infinity, both in creatures and in himself, and, finally, with divine simplicity. By means of further subdivisions, John obtains ten Decades, each of them containing further chapters. The imitation of the Scholastics is, nevertheless, limited to these resemblances; in terms of its content, this Byzantine "Summa de Deo" consists purely of passages from the fathers, organized under the specific points under consideration. The chief authority is Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite; after him, Athanasius, the three Cappadocians, Chrysostom, Cyril of Alexandria, and John of Damascus reappear most frequently.”
Migne reprints the Latin translation of this work, made by Francisco Torres in the late sixteenth century (PG 152, 741-992). More recently, an edition of the Greek text is reported to have appeared, although so far it is not to be found in most Western libraries.
Other works by John Kyparissiotes include nine Hymns addressed to the Word of God and a short work on the question whether the personal properties in the Trinity really differ from the divine essence. (Kyparissiotes’ answer is No.)

Mark Herzlich

Sandon Mark Herzlich, Jr. (born September 1, 1987) is an American football linebacker for the New York Giants of the National Football League. He was signed by the Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2011. He played college football at Boston College.
Early life.
Herzlich was born in Kirkwood, Missouri, the son of Barbara Read (born Martin), a former tennis player, and Sandon Mark Herzlich. His paternal grandfather's Ashkenazi Jewish family left Austria after the German annexion. His father was raised Jewish and converted to Protestanism when Herzlich was born. He has one sibling, younger brother Bradley Martin, who is a member of the football team at Brown University.
High school career.
Herzlich attended Conestoga High School in Tredyffrin Township, Pennsylvania, where he earned Associated Press Class First-team AAAA All-State honors as senior linebacker. Considered a three-star prospect by "Rivals.com", Herzlich was recruited by Boston College, Duke, North Carolina, Vanderbilt and Virginia. He was committed to Virginia some time before he chose to play for Boston College. He recorded 142 tackles and made four interceptions as a junior and also lined up at fullback in 2003 and 2004, scoring three offensive touchdowns. As a senior he registered a team-high 153 tackles, including 48 solo stops, in 2005, and totaled eight tackles for loss, including four sacks; he also returned a blocked field goal 86 yards for a touchdown. He led the Pioneers to back-to-back Central League titles (2004 and 2005) and became the first player in school history to win the team MVP award three times. Herzlich was also a lacrosse star at Conestoga, and received a scholarship offer from Johns Hopkins University to play lacrosse.
College career.
Herzlich went on to attend Boston College and played in all 13 games as a true freshman. He earned "College Football News" Freshman All-American honors with a total of 42 tackles (32 solo), including 5.0 tackles for a loss and 1.0 sack, one interception and forced two fumbles. As a sophomore he started all 14 games for the Eagles and finished the season second in total tackles with 97 (55 solos, 42 assists). He also led the team with 12 tackles-for-loss to go with 1.5 quarterback sacks and 4 pass breakups, 2 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries. Herzlich entered his junior season (2008) as a preseason all-star candidate. He was named to the Lott Trophy and Butkus Award watchlists prior to the season. In 2008 Herzlich was a First-team All-American and the ACC Defensive Player of the Year. He was also a finalist for the Butkus Award, and a quarterfinalist for the Lott Trophy. He led the team with 110 tackles and 81 stops, six interceptions, eight pass break-ups, two forced fumbles, and two fumble recoveries and also had 13 tackles for a loss. In November 2008, Herzlich was a projected top-15 pick by many scouts for the 2009 NFL Draft but announced his return to Boston College for the 2009 season.
Herzlich missed the entire 2009 season due to Ewing's Sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer, which he overcame and earned numerous honors for his courage and outreach, including the Disney Spirit Award, Nils V. "Swede" Nelson Award, an honorary Lott Trophy, and the ACC Commissioner’s Cup.
In 2010 Herzlich returned to the football field and won the Rudy Award and the ACC's Brian Piccolo Award after starting all 13 games and finishing third on the team with 65 tackles and 50 solo stops. He tied for first on the team with two forced fumbles, second on the team with four interceptions and four pass break ups and also had 3.5 tackles for a loss.
Cancer diagnosis.
On May 14, 2009, Herzlich announced that he had been diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer, stating in a press release:
On September 29, 2009, Mark Herzlich announced that he was cancer free. This was confirmed by the team doctors. He publicly announced this during the ESPN and Home Depot College Gameday Special at Boston College on October 3, 2009. He sat out the remainder of the 2009 season and returned in 2010, registering five tackles (three solo) in the season-opening 38-20 win against FCS school Weber State.
Despite not playing college football in 2009, he received the Disney's Wide World of Sports Spirit Award for overcoming cancer, as well as the Nils V. "Swede" Nelson Award for sportsmanship. In January 2011, he received the "Most Courageous Athlete" award from the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association.

Ohaaki Power Station

The Ohaaki Power Station is a geothermal power station owned and operated by Contact Energy. A distinctive feature of this power station is the 105 m high natural draft cooling tower, the only one of its kind in New Zealand.
Although initially constructed to generate 104 MW, decline in the steamfield has meant maximum net capacity is about 65 MW with an annual output of around 400 GWh pa.
There are currently three turbines in operation. One smaller turbine runs off high pressure steam which then backfeeds into the main intermediate pressure system that feeds the two main units. Condensers on the back end of the main turbines are fed cooled water from the cooling tower to condense the steam back into water. Additional condensate gained in this process is reinjected back into the ground.
In 2013, the Waikato Regional Council granted resource consents for a term of 35 years and for a take of 40,000 tonnes per day of geothermal fluid.
Ohaaki Marae.
The plant is located adjacent to the Ohaaki Marae (Ngāti Tahu) on the banks of the Waikato River in New Zealand. Gradual sinking of the marae has been attributed to draw-off of geothermal fluids by the power station. The area of the marae is sinking approximately 170mm a year. In the 1960s, the marae was moved to its present location because the previous site was flooded when the dam for the Ohakuri Power Station was filled.

Hwasong-6

The Hwasong-6 is a North Korean tactical ballistic missile. It is derived from the Hwasong-5, itself a derivative of the Soviet R-17 Elbrus. It carries the NATO reporting name Scud. 
Work on an extended-range version of the Hwasong-5 began in 1988, and with only relatively minor modifications, a new type was produced from 1989, designated Hwasong-6 ("Scud Mod. C" or "Scud-C"). It was first tested in June 1990, and entered full-scale production the same year, or in 1991. It was superseded by the Rodong-1. 
The Hwasong-6 features an improved guidance system (CEP 50 m), and has a range of , with an payload. Such range is sufficient to strike targets as far away as western Japan. Its dimensions are identical to the original Hwasong-5. Due to difficulties in procuring MAZ-543 TELs, mobile launchers were produced in North Korea. By 1999, North Korea was estimated to have produced 600 to 1,000 Hwasong-6 missiles, of which 25 had been launched in tests, 300 to 500 had been exported, and 300 to 600 were in service with the Korean People's Army.
The Hwasong-6 was exported to Iran, where it is designated as the Shahab-2, and to Syria, where it is manufactured under licence with Chinese assistance. It is thought that Cuba also has it together with the Hwasong-5

<doc id="20347364" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20347364" title="Use of animals during the Gravettian period">
Use of animals during the Gravettian period

The Gravettian period occurred in Europe between 30,000 and 22,000 years ago (during the Upper Paleolithic). Gravettian lifestyle was shaped by the climate. Pleniglacial environmental 
changes forced early humans to adapt. West and Central Europe were extremely 
cold during this period. Gravettian culture thrived on their ability to hunt 
animals. They utilized a variety of tools and hunting strategies. Compared to 
theorized hunting techniques of Neanderthals and earlier human groups, Gravettian hunting culture appears much more mobile and complex. 
Acquiring the animals.
In order to use animals as a source of food, tools, and decorations, prey first needed to be caught. The Gravettian period saw hunting techniques emerge in both the use of topography and the use of nets.
Weapons.
Clubs, stones, and sticks were the primary hunting tools during the Upper Paleolithic period, including the Gravettian period. Bone, antler, and ivory points have all been found at sites in France; but proper stone arrowheads and throwing spears did not appear until the Solutrean period (~20,000 Before Present). Due to the primitive tools, many animals were hunted at close range.
Use of topography.
Settlers in the Gravettian period experienced more efficient hunting by placing settlements in areas that pooled migrating prey, thus taking advantage of the topographical features that surrounded them. Examples found through discoveries in Gr. La Gala, a site in Southern Italy, show a strategic settlement based in a small valley. As the settlers became more aware of the migration patterns of animals like red deer, the prey would ultimately herd through the settlements in the valley thereby allowing the hunters to avoid travelling long distances for food. Specifically in Gr. La Gala, the glacial topography forced the deer to pass through the areas in the valley occupied by humans.
Additional evidence of making settlements strategic to animal migrations can be found at sites like Klithi in Greece, where settlements were also strategically placed to intercept migrating species of prey.
Use of nets.
Discoveries in the Czech Republic suggest that nets were first used as a hunting device during the Gravettian period. These nets were used to catch large numbers of small game in a short period of time. This offered a consistent food supply, an alternative to experiencing the feast/famine pattern of large game hunters. Evidence for this theory comes in the form of 4mm thick rope imprints on clay which was then preserved accidentally. Research suggests that although no large net imprints have been discovered, there would be little reason for them not to be made as there is no more knowledge needed to create them. Research on the manner of deployment of the nets came in the form of examination of the aboriginal use and technique. The production of the nets was also a communal task, relying on the work of both women and children to do the weaving.
Food, prey, and diet.
Animals were a primary food source for early humans of the Gravettian period. In addition to animal carcasses and remains, carbon and nitrogen dating confirm the animal contribution to the diets. Since Europe was extremely cold during this time period, food sources needed to be high in energy and fat content. Testing comparisons among various human remains reveal that populations at higher latitudes placed greater dietary emphasis on meat.
A defining trait that distinguished the Gravettian people was their ease of mobility compared to their Neanderthal counterparts. Modern humans developed the technology and social organization that enabled them to migrate with their food source whereas Neanderthals were not adept at travelling, even with relatively sedentary herds.
With their ability to move with the herds, Gravettian diets incorporated a huge variety of animal prey. The main factor for which animal was hunted at a particular time was based on age and size. For example, first year deer offered the best hides, while fourth year deer offered the most flesh for consumption. Mammoths were a prime food source for the people of Central Europe. It is believed that human exploitation, in this manner, has led to their extinction. Gravettian diets also consisted of hyenas, wolves and reindeer. Herds and packs that lived within close proximity to them often served as part of the food source. More common meat sources were hares and foxes, captured communally with nets. This time period is classified by the strong emphasis on meat consumption because agriculture had not been fully introduced nor utilized. In addition, the climate was not favorable to stable crop cultivation.
Coastal Gravettians incorporated another food source: marine protein. From several sources of remains found in Italy and Wales, carbon dating reveals that 20-30% of Gravettian diets of coastal peoples consisted of sea animals. Populations of lower latitudes relied more on shell fish and fish while higher latitudes’ diets consisted of seals.
Use of animal remains.
Decorations and tools.
The following information on animal remains is based on an excavation that took place during the field seasons of 1954 and 1956 at a location known as Pavlov I in southern Moravia. The Gravettian era landscape is the most closely related to the landscape of present day Moravia. Pavlov I is also the most complete and complex Gravettian site to date, therefore making it a perfect model for which to reach a general understanding of Gravettian culture. 
In many instances, animal remains point to both decorative and utilitarian purposes. In the case of the arctic fox, for example, incisors and canines for use as decoration as well as humeri and radii for tool creation were discovered. Very similarly, the remains of red foxes showed decorative incisors and canines as well as ulnas for awls and barbs. Based on the quantity of the red fox remains discovered, it can be asserted that red fox bones were preferred over those of the arctic fox. The reason for this has not been concluded.
Mammoth remnants were also among the most popular due to the abundance of tusks. However, ribs, long bones, and molars were also documented. It is clear in this case as well, that some of the mammoth bones were also used for decorative purposes. Although not as popular in quantity as the mammoth, wolf remains were the most varied of all of the animals. Many parts of the wolf’s skeleton were used for tool production and decoration. These include the ribs, humeri, radii, ulnas, femurs, tibias, fibulas, metapodia, and perforated teeth.
Some animal bones were only used to create tools. Due to their shape, the ribs, fibulas, and metapodia of horses were good for awl and barb creation. In addition, the ribs were also implemented to create different types of smoothers for pelt preparation. The shapes of polar hare bones are also unique, and as a result, the ulnas were commonly used as awls and barbs. Reindeer antlers, ulnas, ribs, tibias, and teeth were utilized in addition to a rare documented case of a phalanx. 
As such, few animal remnants were solely used for decorative purposes. The perforated teeth, non-perforated canines, and metacarpals of brown bears, however, were utilized strictly for decoration. These bears were not a common source of bone usage, for they were not considered regular prey. Even less frequently employed were the discovered bone traces of perforated fish vertebra.
Blades and bladelets.
In order to make decorations and tools from animal remains, blades and bladelets were used. Sites such as CPM II, CPM III, Casal de Felipe, and Fonte Santa (all in Spain) have revealed evidence of blade and bladelet technology during the Gravettian Period. The tools were often made of quartz and rock crystals, and the blades varied in terms of platforms, abrasions, endscrapers, and burins. These burins were made by hammering bones and rocks until sharp shards were created, a process known as lithic reduction. Flint blades have also been found. These blades, like the "Noailles" burin, were used to carve and sharpen bones for use as tools. These tools were typically used to skin animals or to sharpen sticks.

The Other Side of Truth

The Other Side of Truth is a children's novel about Nigerian political refugees, written by Beverley Naidoo and published by Puffin in 2000. It is set in the autumn of 1995 during the reign in Nigeria of the despot General Abacha, who is waging a campaign of suppression against journalists. A Nigerian girl and her younger brother must leave suddenly after their mother is killed in a failed assassination of their outspoken father. They are smuggled to London but abandoned and they must cope with the police, social services and school bullies.
Naidoo won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject.
HarperCollins published the first U.S. edition in 2001.
Plot summary.
Although this novel is written in the third person, it presents the perspective of a 12-year-old girl, Sade Solaja. Her father, Folarin Solaja, is a journalist, one of the most critical of the corrupt regime. The book opens with her memory of hearing the two shots which ended her mother's life, a memory which recurs throughout the novel in her thoughts and dreams. Her memories of Nigeria are often set in contrast to her experiences of an alien England, while her mother's remembered words of wisdom give her comfort and strength. The concentration on Sade's point of view makes many events seem obscure and confusing, just as she experiences them.
After the shooting, Sade's Uncle Tunde urges her father to send her and her 10-year-old brother Femi to safety in England. They are forced to pack and leave suddenly and secretly. They fly to London posing as the children of a stranger, Mrs Bankole, so they can travel on her passport. When their Uncle Dele fails to collect them at the airport, Mrs Bankole abandons them at a coffee shop near Victoria Station. Money less and friendless, they wander the streets looking for the art college where their uncle works. They find refuge in a video store, but the owner calls the police, believing them to be vandals. Thus they come to the attention of the authorities. Worried to tell the truth in case it endangers their father, Sade takes refuge in silence and later in half-truths. The children are fostered first by Mrs Graham and her rude and mean son Kevin and later by the Kings, a Jamaican couple whose children have grown up and left. They are sent to different schools. Sade is sent to Avon School where she meets a girl from Somalia, called Mariam whose story is similar to Sade's. Marcia and Donna the Bullies from school treat Sade very badly, putting pressure on her to steal a turquoise lighter from Mariam's uncle's store. Femi goes to Greenslades Primary School. They become reticent with each other.
It later emerges that her worried father has entered England illegally to look for them but has been arrested. There is a chance that he will be deported to face certain death in Nigeria, especially as the Nigerian police claim he is wanted for his wife's murder. Although Iyawo Jenny and Mr Nathan try their hardest to help Sade's father but things are not working out. Sade braves the freezing night to speak to "Mr. Seven O'Clock", the newscaster whom she has seen on television, to bring her father's story to the attention of the British public. The story ends with her father's release for Christmas, though asylum has yet to be granted. They hope one day they can return safely to Nigeria. Sade misses her grandmother and her former life. arhum nadeem from pakistan
Foreword.
The foreword is written by Jon Snow, a real-life "Mr Seven O'Clock", who describes the book as "a fast and vivid account of a family's escape from threat and murder... Not only a marvellous read, but one that refuels the desire for justice and freedom within and beyond our shores."
Sequel.
"Web of Lies" continues the story of the Solaja family in England. This story deals with the problems faced by Femi while the family is waiting to hear if asylum is to be granted.
Themes.
The book consists of several themes. The most important and recognisable are:
Awards.
"The Other Side of Truth" won a UK Arts Council Award for work in progress. After publication it won the British librarians (CILIP) Carnegie Medal as the year's best children's book. A retrospective citation by CILIP says that it "skilfully blends fact and fiction to leave a lasting impression of real issues at work" and describes it as: "An important book which challenges the notion of 'truth' itself." It further describes the writing as "gripping, powerful and evocative".
"The Other Side of Truth" was silver runner up for the 2000 Nestlé Smarties Book Prize, was named an International Board on Books for Young People Honour Book in 2002, and won the 2002 Jane Addams Children's Book Award.
Allusions to historical events.
The novel refers to the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other journalists, which caused an international outcry in 1995. It is set in the immediate aftermath of those executions. Although in the early twenty-first century the military regime no longer controls the country, media rights body Reporters Without Borders says Nigeria is still a violent place for the press, with journalists often suffering beatings, unfair arrests and police raids.
Also referred to in the novel is the civil war in Somalia, which Sade's school friend Mariam experienced as a young child.

John Dawney

John Dawney's elder brother, Thomas Dawney of Escrick, Yorkshire, married Elizabeth, the daughter of John Newton of Snaith, Yorkshire, and was ancestor of the Viscounts Downe.
John Dawney served in King Edward III's expedition to Honfleur in 1346, and fought at the Battle of Crécy on 26 August 1346, for which he was made a knight banneret. He died shortly after the battle, in 1346/7.
Dawney married Sybil Treverbyn, the daughter of Walter de Treverbyn of Treverbyn, Cornwall. They had one surviving child, a daughter Emeline or Emme (c. 1329 – 28 February 1371), who married Sir Edward Courtenay (c.1331 – 1368x1371), third son of Hugh Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon, and by him had two sons, Edward and Hugh. The elder son, Edward (c. 1357 – 5 December 1419), inherited the earldom from his grandfather, the 10th Earl, and became 11th Earl of Devon. The 11th Earl married Maud Camoys, and the earldom remained in their descendants until their great-grandson, Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon, was beheaded at York on 3 April 1461 after the Battle of Towton, dying without issue. All his honours were forfeited by attainder, and the earldom eventually passed, after a brief period of confusion during the Wars of the Roses (for which see Earl of Devon), by a new creation in 1485 to Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (d.1509), the grandson of Sir Hugh Courtenay of Haccombe and Bampton (1358–1425), brother of the 11th Earl.
Emme Dawney is said to have brought an estate consisting of 'fifteen large manors in Cornwall' to the Courtenay family.
Two effigies under a canopy in the south transept in the parish church of St. Peter and St. Paul at Sheviock, Cornwall, of a knight in gilded armour and his lady are considered to represent Sir Edward Courtenay and his wife, Emeline Dawney. A third effigy of a knight in the north aisle is said to represent Emeline's father, Sir John Dawney. The arms given by Lysons for the Dawney or De Alneto family are 'Argent, on a bend cotized sable, three annulets of the field'.

Focke-Wulf Fw 159

The Focke-Wulf Fw 159 was an experimental German fighter of the 1930s that never reached production. The Focke-Wulf company designed the aircraft as one of the four entries for the "Rüstungsflugzeug" IV ("Armed Aircraft IV") 1934 fighter competition. Its parasol wing configuration was based on the company's successful trainer product, the Focke-Wulf Fw 56 "Stösser" and it used a Junkers Jumo 210 engine. The plane had a rearwards-retracting. lever action suspension main undercarriage, retracting completely into the lower fuselage, and an enclosed cockpit, although the main undercarriage mechanism was very complicated, fragile and proved endlessly troublesome.
The first prototype - Fw-159 "V-1" - was ready in the spring of 1935, but was destroyed when it crash-landed, following the failure of the main undercarriage to deploy properly.
The second prototype - "V-2" - had a reinforced undercarriage. The general flight characteristics were good, but the rate of climb and rate of turn were unsatisfactory, and the aircraft suffered greater drag than its competitors in the contest (which were the Arado Ar 80, Heinkel He 112 and Messerschmitt Bf 109). The competition was won by the Bf 109.

Cramond Roman Fort

Cramond Roman Fort is a Roman-Era archaeological site at Cramond, Edinburgh, Scotland. The settlement may be the "Rumabo" listed in the 7th-century "Ravenna Cosmography". The fort was established around 140 AD and occupied until around 170, with a further period of occupation from around 208 to 211. Among the many archaeological finds, one of the most famous is a sculpture known as the Cramond Lioness.
History.
The fort at Cramond was located on the River Almond at the point where it flows into the Forth. In Roman times, there was probably a natural harbour here. The fort was established around 140 during the building of the Antonine Wall, and remained in use until around 170 when the Romans retreated south to Hadrian's Wall. When the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus began the last major Roman incursion into Scotland from 208 to 211, the fort was reoccupied and enlarged. Throughout these periods of occupation a civilian settlement seems to have existed outside the fort, and some native occupation of the fort seems to have taken place after the time of Severus into the 4th century.
Finds.
A stone altar which was dug up a few hundred years ago in the grounds of Cramond House, was originally erected by a cohort of Tungrians (either first or second) and was dedicated to "the Alatervan Mothers and the Mothers of the Parade-ground" (). Early antiquarians interpreted this as referring to the place where the stone was found, and drew from it the conclusion that the Roman name of Cramond was "Alaterva". This idea is no longer accepted among scholars, and "Alatervae" is now believed to be an epithet attached to the Matronae, following a practice found elsewhere in the empire. It is thought that Cramond may be the "Rumabo" listed in the 7th-century "Ravenna Cosmography" – the original form of the name perhaps being "Carumabo".
Other stones found at the fort include a centurial stone of Legio II Augusta, and an altar "To Jupiter Optimus Maximus" erected by the fifth cohort of Gauls. 
The most famous sculpture is the Cramond Lioness recovered from the mouth of the River Almond in 1997. The sculpture, in a non-local white sandstone, shows a lioness devouring her prey, a naked bearded male torso. The sculpture was probably part of a large tomb monument of an important Roman officer, perhaps the fort commander or an important dignitary.
The site today.
The ground plan of part of the fort is laid out in an area of open parkland. Here one can see headquarters building, granaries, workshop, together with other buildings, restored in outline. Information panels at the site link the findings of the last 50 years of excavations and recreate life in the former Roman headquarters and bathhouse.
Since 2000 there have been plans to turn the Roman remains at Cramond into a tourist attraction. The plans include a visitor centre and museum, housing most of the Roman artefacts discovered in the area over the years, including the Cramond Lioness.

Rock Island Public Library

The Rock Island Public Library is located in downtown Rock Island, Illinois. The Rock Island Public Library traces its beginnings to 1872, making it the oldest public library in Illinois. However, fee-based public libraries started in 1855 in Rock Island and have contributed to the history of Illinois' original library system.
Association Library 1855-1857.
On June 23, 1855 Joseph B. Danforth, the editor of the "Rock Island Republican" printed an editorial explaining four reasons why Rock Island needed a start a public library. Then the following week on June 27, 1855 an anonymous letter was published in the "Rock Island Argus", formerly the "Republican", offering to give $100 to build a book collection if nine other men would promise to give $100 and if they city promised to give the ten men lifelong membership and a building to store the books. However, nine other men did not pledge $100. Which the $1,000 needed to build a collection, Rock Island's citizens decided to have a meeting on September 15, 1855, to decide how a library could be created in Rock Island. The meeting created the Rock Island Library and Reading Room Association, a board of officers and a committee to draft a constitution. However, since Illinois law did not have a provision that allowed the city to tax the residents to fund a library, the board of officers decided have a library that was open to the "public" as long the man was a Rock Island resident and could pay the yearly members fee. By the end of the September 15 meeting, the men had raised $500 from their own personal funds, set up another committee designed to raise money for the library and a fee schedule. The library fees ranged from $3.00 for a yearly membership to $100 for a family lifetime membership as long as the children are under 21 years old. However, for unexplained reasons by the end of 1857 the Association Library closed, forcing library members to store the books at their own homes for safekeeping until another library would be opened in 1865.
Young Men's Literary Association 1865-1871.
On January 12, 1865, a notice printed in the Rock Island Argus informed the public that there would be a meeting on the 16th for the purpose of creating a new library. An informal constitution and library board was created before meeting in the hope that a new library would be created. The first meeting of the Young Men’s Literary Association was on January 23, 1865, and that night the constitution was adopted and officers were elected. The yearly fee of membership was set at $3.00 per year. After setting the business of the library, the next step was to retrieve all of the books that were left at former members' homes when the Library Association closed in 1859, leaving about 1,500 books available for checkout. However, almost 1,000 books were never recovered and were lost forever in former members' homes. In April 1866, the library opened six days a week, closing on Sunday. In 1868, the library hired Miss Ellen Gale as the new librarian. Miss Gale worked at Rock Island Public Libraries for 64 years, the longest tenure of any librarian in the history of Illinois. The Association Library closed three years later to start the free Rock Island Public Library by giving the new public library their entire book collection.
Rock Island Public Library 1872-1901.
In 1872 the Illinois State Legislature created a law that allowed city councils to create public libraries, by giving city councils the power to tax citizens for public library funding. Soon after the law was signed into law the Rock Island City Council was quick to implement the new tax, and the Rock Island Public Library opened its door on November 25, 1872 with Miss Gale as the head librarian. The new library's received their supplies and books from the collection own by the Young Men’s Literary Association, whom served as fee-based public library from 1865-1971. The library was located in the same rooms at the second floor of the Mitchell & Lynde Building on Eagle Street (now the location of the First of America Bank) that the Rock Island City Library and Reading Room Association was housed during it existence from 1855-1859. The library board decided that for all citizens to be able to use the library is had to be open seven days a week, since many people only had Sundays off. By the end of the first two weeks the library was opened over 1,000 books had been checked out and the library board decided to rent another room to increase space for new books and additional reading room for patrons.
Over the next ten years the library would continue to have budget and space problems. By 1891 Miss Gale, by the request of the citizens had organized the books by subject (history, travel, poetry and fiction) and alphabetical order within their subject. To raise money for more books at the library, Miss Gale sold copies of the books catalog for $.15 a piece. In 1899 the library had 14,866 books in their collection, 1,070 of them children's books. The Rock Island Public Library had out grown their three rooms at the Mitchell & Lynde Building and the library board started to look for land and financing to build a new library to support the library's collection of books and the growing population of Rock Island readers. On April 3, 1900 the library board purchased a lot for the new library and on January 10, 1901 the board chose to the design plans for an Ionic building finished in Italian Renaissance Architecture.
Rock Island Public Library 1902-present.
On August 23, 1902 a cornerstone was laid at the northwest corner of the future public library. In September 1902 the decorative frieze was placed around the top of the building. The twelve authors carved into the sandstone are the last names of Homer, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Virgil, Victor Hugo, William Shakespeare, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Robert Burns, Esaias Tegner, Alighieri Dante, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and George Bancroft. The total cost of the library when it was completed was $90,448.20, $30,000 over the proposed library budget. The Main Library building opened on December 15, 1903 in downtown Rock Island for browsing. When the library first opened it was called the Rock Island’s Temple of Literature and was hailed by the Argus as one of the most "handsomely appointed in the State outside of Chicago." On the main or first floor was divided between an Adult Reading Room, Children's Department, Reference Department, and enough stacks to hold 16,000 books. The second floor had two unfinished meeting rooms, the Director's Office and a room to hold local artwork. The only artwork in the local art showroom was a model of the battleship "Illinois", made by David Thompson. The basement housed the heating plant, an unpacking room, and a storage room for back issues of the Argus and local historical documents. On May 3, 1937 Miss Gale resigned as the librarian of the Rock Island Public Library. However, The library continued to grow over the next 100 years by adding two branch libraries, additions and renovations to the downtown library and an expanding collection.
Main Library.
The Main Library building opened on December 15, 1903 in downtown Rock Island. When the library first opened it was called the Rock Island’s Temple of Literature, but the name has been changed to the Main Library since the introduction of the branches. The current layout of the library has changed from its original opening in 1903. The basement houses the large Children's Department, including children's study area and children's computer lab. The basement has its own Circulation Department, bathrooms and an art exhibit titled Story Mountain, which was completed in 1985. The main floor or first floor houses the reference and circulations Departments, computer lab, and a small local history collection of Rock Island history. The main floor houses the fiction-mystery, romance, western, new, DVD & VHS, newspaper & magazine, and reference collections. The second floor houses the business office of the Rock Island Public Library, local art exhibit room, and the non-fiction collection. The basement, first, and second floors each have study areas and wireless internet. During the winter and fall months the library is open seven days a week and during the spring and summer the library is open six days a week, closing on Sunday. An addition was added to the Main library in 1986 and it was extensively remodeled in 2006.
The Main library's phone number is 309-732-READ, which was designed so patrons would be unable to forget the number. The Rock Island Public Library is a member of PALS (Prairie Area Library System) a consortium 186 lending libraries.
30/31 Branch Library.
The 30/31 Branch library is located at the intersection of 31st Avenue and 30th Street, which is why it is called the 30/31 Library. The branch was formerly a fire station, which was closed when Rock Island's fire stations consolidated in the 1950s. Soon after the fire station closed the city council decided to open it as a branch library to serve the information needs of Rock Island's citizens that could not travel to the downtown library. After extensively remodeling the fire station, the branch was opened in 1957 to the public. The branch has wireless internet access, a computer lab, children's and adult reading areas and a self-checkout machine. The branch features a drive-up book pickup and book drop. The branch is open six days a week and closed on Sundays. The branch also holds the Friends of the Rock Island Library Coffee Shop and Book Sale room, which raises money for library improvements and children's programing funding. The south side of the branch has an Illinois native wildflower garden and table set for patrons wanting to enjoy nature while reading.
Southwest Branch Library.
The Southwest Rock Island branch is located in Southwest Rock Island, an area that is south of the original city of Rock Island and is separated by the Rock River (Mississippi River) and the village of Milan. The Southwest branch was created to conveniently serve the information needs of Southwest Rock Island citizens, because of the distance to the Main and the 30/31 libraries. The Southwest Library is attached to the Rock Island Fire Station #2. In 1974 a small library was added onto the side of the fire station, and it opened soon after to the public. In 2001 the branch was renovated adding bathrooms, a community room, children's room, and computer lab and study area. The community room is used for Library Board meetings, story times, Book discussion club and special Rock Island City Council meetings; it is also available to non-profit organizations groups by contacting the library office. The branch has wireless internet, computer lab, children's and adult reading areas and a self-checkout machine.

Miles Coope

Miles Coope, born at Gildersome, Yorkshire, on 18 November 1916 and died also at Gildersome on 5 July 1974, played first-class cricket for three seasons after the second World War for Somerset.
A right-handed middle-order batsman sometimes used as an opener and an occasional leg-break bowler, Coope played for Yorkshire's second eleven in Minor Counties cricket before the war. He was also prominent in Bradford League cricket, and he followed another leading Bradford League cricketer, Johnny Lawrence, to Somerset after the war, arriving for the 1947 season. 
Coope made 20 and 58 in his first match, the Whitsun 1947 County Championship game against Gloucestershire. After this, he played regularly for the rest of the season and less than two months after making his debut, he scored 113, his first century and the highest score of his career, as Somerset beat the 1947 season's County Champions, Middlesex for the second time in the season – Middlesex were, however, lacking the prolific Denis Compton, Bill Edrich and Jack Robertson, all of whom were playing in the Gentlemen v Players match. The century brought Coope his county cap. 
By the end of his first season in first-class cricket, Coope had scored 791 runs at an average of 20.81.
In the 1948 season, Coope played in every single match played by Somerset and topped 1,000 runs for the county, finishing with 1172 runs for the season at the average of 22.11 runs per innings. He did not make a century, his highest being 89 against Sussex at Eastbourne, when he put on 209 for the fifth wicket with Harold Gimblett, who made the then highest-ever score for Somerset, 310. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that Coope "gave some attractive displays but inclined to inconsistency".
In 1949, Coope began the season well and in the match against Lancashire at Old Trafford in mid May he hit an unbeaten 102, his second century of his career, out of a Somerset total of 190. But his batting fell away and when Somerset's usual band of August amateurs became available, he lost his place and did not regain it. At the end of the season, he was not re-engaged and returned to League cricket in Yorkshire. 
In just three seasons of first-class cricket, Coope had made 2789 runs at an average of 21.12. But the reputation for inconsistency, first aired in Wisden, remains. David Foot, the historian of Somerset cricket, wrote of Coope: "As a batsman his range of shots was ambitious and he had one of the most delicate late cuts ever paraded in the West. There were two centuries from him but he was also a luxury, never quite consistent or disciplined enough with his repertoire to make a successful county cricketer."

Denton Welch

Maurice Denton Welch (29 March 1915 – 30 December 1948) was an English writer and painter, admired for his vivid prose and precise descriptions.
Biography.
Welch was born in Shanghai and spent his childhood in China — he recorded this in his fictionalised autobiography of his early years, "Maiden Voyage" (1943). With the help and patronage of Edith Sitwell and John Lehmann this became a small but lasting success and made for him a distinct and individual reputation. It was followed by the novel "In Youth is Pleasure" (1944), a study of adolescence, and by "Brave and Cruel" (1949). An unfinished autobiographical novel "A Voice Through a Cloud" was published posthumously in 1950.
Welch did not set out to be a writer. After leaving Repton, he studied art at Goldsmiths' in London with the intention of becoming a painter. At the age of twenty, he was hit by a car while cycling in Surrey and suffered a fractured spine. Although he was not paralysed, he suffered severe pain and complications, including spinal tuberculosis that ultimately led to his early death. 
His literary work, intense and introverted, includes insightful portraits of his friends, and minutely observed portraits of the English countryside during World War II. A close attention to aesthetics, be it in human behaviour, physical appearance, clothing, art, architecture, jewelry, or antiques, is also a recurring concern in his writings. Shorter works include the essay on the painter Walter Sickert which, published originally in "The London Magazine" brought him to the notice of Sitwell. He continued occasionally to paint; there is a fine self-portrait (in the National Portrait Gallery), and some intricate line illustrations in the early editions of his books.
William S. Burroughs cited Denton Welch as the writer who most influenced his own work(W.S Burroughs, The Cat Inside, Penguin books 2002, p67)and dedicated his novel "The Place of Dead Roads" to him.

James O'Loghlin (Australian politician)

James Vincent O'Loghlin (25 November 1852 – 4 December 1925) was an Australian politician. Born in Gumeracha, South Australia, he was educated at the Classical and Commercial Academy in Adelaide before becoming a farmer and wheat buyer. Later a journalist and owner of country newspapers, he was active in Irish nationalist organisations. In 1888, he was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council for the Labor Party, serving until 1902. In 1907, he was appointed to the Australian Senate after the election of Anti-Socialist Senator Joseph Vardon was declared void. However, O'Loghlin's own appointment was declared void, and he and Vardon contested a special election, which was won by Vardon. He was elected in his own right as a Labor Senator in 1913, but was defeated in 1919, having been the only one of South Australia's five Labor senators not to defect to the Nationalist Party after the 1916 split over conscription. O'Loghlin returned to the Senate in 1922, but died in 1925; the South Australian Nationalist Government successfully installed Nationalist Henry Barwell in his vacancy.

Moon (film)

Moon is a 2009 British science fiction drama film co-written and directed by Duncan Jones. The film follows Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), a man who experiences a personal crisis as he nears the end of a three-year solitary stint mining helium-3 on the far side of the Moon. It was the feature debut of director Duncan Jones. Kevin Spacey voices Sam's robot companion, GERTY. "Moon" premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and was released in select cinemas in New York and Los Angeles on 12 June 2009. The release was expanded to additional theatres in the United States and Toronto on both 3 and 10 July and to the United Kingdom on 17 July.
Plot.
In 2035, Lunar Industries have made a fortune after an oil crisis by building a large lunar mining base on the Moon, called "Sarang", and since then have been extracting a large amount of helium-3 back to Earth. "Sarang" itself is a largely automated mining base with only one man on the base provided with a three-year contract to operate and to deliver helium-3 on Earth, while his family is paid large amounts of money.
Sam Bell, Lunar Industries astronaut and "Sarang" operator, nears the end of a three-year work contract as the sole resident at "Sarang". Sam oversees automated harvesters and launches canisters bound for Earth, containing the helium-3 they have extracted. Chronic communication problems have disabled his live feed from Earth and limit him to occasional recorded messages to his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left. His only companion is an artificial intelligence named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation and to provide comfort for him. GERTY itself is a large canister-like computer with a small screen to provide emoticons for happiness, confusion and sadness.
On Sam's last shifts, around only two weeks before he will be transported back to Earth, Sam suffers from hallucinations of a teenage girl. One such image distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his rover into the harvester. Rapidly losing air from the exposed rover, Sam puts on his helmet, but loses consciousness soon after.
Sam, who appears to be younger, awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident. He overhears GERTY receiving instructions from Lunar Industries not to let him outside the base and to wait for the arrival of rescue team "Eliza". His suspicions aroused, he manufactures a fake problem to force GERTY to let him outside. He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds an older Sam Bell, unconscious.
He brings Old Sam back to the base and tends to his injuries. The two Sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other. After a heated argument and physical altercation, they together coerce GERTY into revealing that they are "both" clones of the original Sam Bell. GERTY activated New Sam after the rover crash and implanted the memories of the original Sam Bell, and convinced the younger Sam that he has started a new three-year contract.
The two Sams begin searching the base, finding live communications jammed by transmitters located beyond the outermost perimeter of the base. They also discover that four previous clones all started to physically deteriorate three years after awakening. Told they would hibernate briefly for the journey home, they were actually incinerated after being put to sleep.
The two Sams, after examining the room, find a secret vault, containing hundreds of hibernating Sams inside, realizing that Lunar Industries manufactures clones so they don't have to pay for a new astronaut and that they are practising an unethical technique. Old Sam drives past the interference radius in a second rover and calls Tess on Earth. However, he instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died "some years ago". He hangs up when he hears her father, original Sam, talking in the background and coming toward the screen.
The two Sams realize that the incoming Eliza "rescue" team will kill them both if they are found together. New Sam suggests sending the other to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports, but Old Sam, already badly deteriorated, knows that he will not live much longer. He suggests New Sam leave instead, and alert the public to Lunar Industries' unethical practices. Old Sam plans to die by the crashed rover so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything until it is too late.
New Sam orders GERTY to revive a seventh clone to greet the rescuers, then programs a harvester to crash and wreck a jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth. On the advice of GERTY — and to prevent the ELIZA team from discovering their plan by examining its memory archives — New Sam then reboots GERTY, erasing its records of the event. Old Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the ship carrying New Sam to Earth.
As the credits roll, the helium transport is depicted entering Earth's upper atmosphere, while news reports describe how "a Sam Bell clone's" testimony on Lunar Industries' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, with the company's shares dipping by a significant margin for its unethical practice.
Production.
This is the first feature film directed by commercial director Duncan Jones, who co-wrote the script with Nathan Parker. The film was specifically written as a vehicle for actor Sam Rockwell. The film pays homage to the films of Jones' youth, such as "Silent Running" (1972), "Alien" (1979), and "Outland" (1981).
Jones described the intent: " wanted to create something which felt comfortable within that canon of those science fiction films from the sort of late seventies to early eighties." The director spoke of his interest in the lunar setting: "for me, the Moon has this weird mythic nature to it... There is still a mystery to it. As a location, it bridges the gap between science-fiction and science fact. We (humankind) have been there. It is something so close and so plausible and yet at the same time, we really don't know that much about it."
The director described the lack of romance in the Moon as a location, citing images from the Japanese lunar orbiter SELENE: "It's the desolation and emptiness of it... it looks like some strange ball of clay in blackness... Look at photos and you'll think that they're monochrome. In fact, they're not. There simply are no primary colours." Jones made reference to the photography book "Full Moon" by Michael Light in designing the look of the film.
"Moon"'s budget was $5 million. The director took steps to minimise production costs, such as keeping the cast small and filming in a studio. "Moon" was produced at Shepperton Studios, in London, where it was filmed in 33 days. Jones preferred using models to digital animation. Jones worked with Bill Pearson, the supervising model maker on "Alien", to help design the lunar rovers and helium-3 harvesters in the film. The Moon base was created as a full 360-degree set, measuring long and approximately wide. The film's robot, GERTY, was designed to be bound to an overhead rail within the mining base since its mechanical tether was critical to the story's plot. The visual effects were provided by Cinesite, which has sought cut-price deals with independent films. Since Jones had an effects background with TV advertisements, he drew on his experience to create special effects within a small budget.
Release.
International sales for "Moon" are handled by the "Independent" sales company. Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group acquired distribution rights to the film for English-speaking territories. Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group was considering making "Moon" a direct-to-DVD release; however, after "Moon" premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival in January 2009, Sony Pictures Classics decided to handle this film's theatrical release for Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group.
Sony Pictures Classics distributed the film in the United States in cinemas, beginning with screenings in select cinemas in New York and Los Angeles on 12 June. The film's British premiere was held on 20 June 2009 at the Cameo Cinema in Edinburgh as part of the 63rd Edinburgh International Film Festival. Jones was present at the screening along with other key crew members. The full UK release was on 17 July, two days after the release of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince". The Australian release was on 8 October.
Box office.
"Moon" grossed £700,394 from its domestic release, $3,370,366 from its North American release and $9,760,104 worldwide.
Critical reception.
"Moon" received positive reviews. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 89% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 185 reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10. The site's consensus states: "Boosted by Sam Rockwell's intense performance, "Moon" is a compelling work of science-fiction, and a promising debut from director Duncan Jones." On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 67 based on 29 reviews, considered to be "generally favorable reviews". Damon Wise of "The Times" praised Jones' "thoughtful" direction and Rockwell's "poignant" performance. Wise wrote of the film's approach to the science fiction genre: "Though it uses impressive sci-fi trappings to tell its story—the fabulous models and moonscapes are recognisably retro yet surprisingly real—this is a film about what it means, and takes, to be human."
Duane Byrge of "The Hollywood Reporter" applauded screenwriter Nathan Parker's “sharp individualistic” dialogue and the way in which Parker combined science fiction and Big Brother themes. Byrge also believed that cinematographer Gary Shaw's work and composer Clint Mansell's music intensified the drama. Byrge wrote: “Nonetheless, "Moon" is darkened by its own excellencies: The white, claustrophobic look is apt and moody, but a lack of physical action enervates the story thrust.” The critic felt mixed about the star's performance, describing him as “adept at limning his character's dissolution” but finding that he did not have “the audacious, dominant edge” for the major confrontation at the end of the film.
"Empire" magazine praised Rockwell's performance, including it in '10 Egregious Oscar Snubs—The worthy contenders that the Academy overlooked' feature and referred to his performance as "one ... of the best performances of the year".
Roger Ebert gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, saying: “"Moon" is a superior example of that threatened genre, hard science-fiction, which is often about the interface between humans and alien intelligence of one kind of or other, including digital. John W. Campbell Jr., the godfather of this genre, would have approved. The movie is really all about ideas. It only seems to be about emotions. How real are our emotions, anyway? How real are we? Someday I will die. This laptop I'm using is patient and can wait.” "Moon" also received positive reviews at the Sundance Film Festival.
Reception from the scientific community.
"Moon" was screened as part of a lecture series at NASA's Space Center Houston, at the request of a professor there. “He'd been reading online that we'd done this film about helium-3 mining and that's something that people at NASA are working on”, says Jones. “We did a Q&A afterward. They asked me why the base looked so sturdy, like a bunker, and not like the kind of stuff they are designing that they are going to transport with them. I said 'Well, in the future I assume you won't want to continue carrying everything with you, you'll want to use the resources on the moon to build things' and a woman in the audience raised her hand and said, 'I'm actually working on something called mooncrete, which is concrete that mixes lunar regolith and ice water from the moon's polar caps.'”
Sequels.
Jones is planning a follow-up graphic novel, titled "Mute", which will serve as an epilogue to "Moon". Should the project progress to a film, "Sam has agreed to do a little cameo in the next film", says Jones, who ultimately hopes to complete a trilogy of films set in the same fictional universe.

<doc id="20348279" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20348279" title="Podaxis">
Podaxis

Podaxis is a genus of secotioid fungi in the family Agaricaceae. Species, which have the appearance of a "stalked-puffball", have a worldwide distribution, and tend to be found growing solitary or scattered on sandy soils, especially in arid regions. Although close to 50 species have been described, it has been argued that many of them may represent extremes in the natural range of variations found in "Podaxis pistillaris".
Description.
Fruiting bodies have the appearance of an unopened "Coprinus comatus", with a stipe and a loose, brown to blackish powdery gleba at maturity. Basidiospores are obovate, thick-walled with a large apical pore, and typically 10-17 x 9-12 µm in size. Clamp connections are present.
"Podaxis" is a common inhabitant of soil and termite mounds throughout the drier regions of the tropics and subtropics of the world. "P. pistillaris" is a ground-inhabiting species, but most "Podaxis" species in the rest of the world are associated with termite mounds. This includes the Australian species "P. beringamensis".
Taxonomy.
The genus was originally named "Podaxis" and described by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux in 1809, while Elias Magnus Fries later (1829) called the taxon "Podaxon". Although a number of articles have used the latter name, "Podaxis" is the preferred name as it has nomenclatorial priority due to its earlier appearance.
Early suggestions that "Podaxis" was related to the genus "Coprinus" were later confirmed using phylogenetic analysis based on sequence data of rDNA genes. This research showed that "Podaxis" is in a clade with the species "Montagnea arenaria" and "Agaricus pocillator", and the genus "Leucocoprinus". For this reason, "Podaxis" was transferred to the family Agaricaceae (order Agaricales) from the now obsolete family name "Podaxaceae" (order Podaxales).
A section of "Podaxis", named "Parvispora", was circumscribed to accommodate three species ("P. argentinus", "P. longii" and "P. microsporus") with small spores.
Uses.
The dark purple spores of "Podaxis" species are used by Australian aborigines as a face paint. "Podaxis aegyptiacus" is used as a common traditional medicine in the Bamako region of Mali for wound-healing, and water extracts from the mushroom have been shown to have carbohydrates with beneficial effects on the immune system in vitro.

Seager Evans and Co.

Seager Evans and Co. (established 1805) was a London based wine and spirits company. They specialised in distillation of gin, and their most famous product was Seagers Gin.
19th century.
The company was founded in 1805 as a partnership between James Lys Seager and William Evans. Both were young men, in their twenties, when the company was formed. Their first distillery was Millbank Distillery sited near the banks of the Thames in London, where it remained for over a century.
On the 28th February 1832 Seager and Evans were elected as members of the Rectifier's Club. Other contemporary members of the club included well known names in the gin industry such as Booth, Gordon, Tanqueray, Nicholson and Burnett.
The original partnership ended with death of William Evans in 1856. Sir Frederick Seager Hunt, grandson of James Lys Seager, began to take an active role in the business, and eventually became sole proprietor on the death of his grandfather in 1873. Sir Frederick continued as head of the company on until 1898 when the business was sold to a public company formed for that purpose. From then on the company was Seager Evans and Company "Limited".
20th century.
In 1922 the distillery was moved to Deptford, and there followed thereafter a period of expansion for Seager Evans. They branched out into whisky, establishing Strathclyde Grain distillery in 1927, and founding a subsidiary, Long John International Ltd, in the same year to operate their new whisky business. They also expanded into international markets, opening a gin distillery in Chile in 1929, and another in Brazil in 1934.
The company was acquired by Schenley Industries of New York in 1956, and under new ownership the company's efforts were focused more strongly on the whisky market, with a number of investments in that sector, including the purchasing of Laphroaig in 1962.
The end of the name Seager Evans and Co. came in 1970 when the company was renamed Long John International Ltd.

John Shannon (Australian politician)

John Wallace Shannon (28 April 1862 – 30 January 1926) was an Australian politician. Born in Angaston, South Australia, where he was educated, he became a farmer on the Yorke Peninsula and an auctioneer. He served on Maitland Council, of which he was mayor. In 1896, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Yorke Peninsula, transferring to Wallaroo in 1902. He left the Assembly in 1905. In 1912, he was appointed to the Australian Senate as a Liberal Senator for South Australia, filling the casual vacancy caused by the death of Labor Senator William Russell. This was the first time a state government had successfully replaced a Senator with a Senator of a different party, after Labor's failed attempt in 1907 to appoint James O'Loghlin to succeed Joseph Vardon. Defeated in 1913, he was elected in 1914 with over 95% of the vote due to the death of Labor Senator Gregor McGregor, which left the Labor Party with only five nominees. They directed the sixth vote to Shannon, resulting in an easy return to the Senate. He joined the Nationalist Party when it formed in 1917, and retired from the Senate in 1919. Shannon died in 1926.

<doc id="20348412" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20348412" title="Virtual bidding">
Virtual bidding

Virtual bidding is a strategy implemented in various Independent System Operator electricity markets of trading Day-Ahead prices against Real-Time (or Hour-Ahead) prices. The term "bid" can be used loosely in electricity markets to refer to an offer to buy or to sell. And the term "virtual" is used to refer to the fact that, while these trades occur in a physical market, virtual trades never entail taking a physical position—because every sell (or buy) Day Ahead will be closed by a buy (or sell) in Real Time. The ISO maintains a trade execution system that ensures all virtual positions will be closed before delivery time. A virtual bidding platform gives financial entities a way to participate in these physical markets, with no physical assets or presence on the grid. They can attempt to capitalize on regular divergences between these markets of different time period for the same underlying (perhaps using time, absolute price levels, or other external variables as conditioning factors). If this strategy of trading one time period against another without the intent (or perhaps even the ability) to deliver or receive physical power is implemented outside of a transaction system that identifies virtual bids and ensures they will be closed, it may be referred to as "implicit" virtual bidding. Virtual positions are included in the same simultaneous feasibility tests and price determination processes as real positions. Thus they can serve to reduce inefficiencies in the market.
Virtual bidding is a form of speculation not dissimilar to futures trading in the other commodity markets. Virtual bidding is the buying and selling of electricity without ever physically producing or consuming it. Instead all trades are offset in a subsequent market thus preventing physical delivery. There are a number of differences between virtual bidding and traditional commodity markets. Prominent amongst these are that virtual bidding occurs in electricity markets that are discrete, whereas most commodity markets allow for continuous trading. In addition virtual bidding usually occurs for very short time horizons, usually between the day-ahead market and the real-time market. There is no reason why it should not occur in different electricity markets. For example, buying and selling monthly contracts for a common delivery point such as the California-Oregon Border (COB) without ever taking physical delivery is extremely similar to virtual trading, although in this latter case the product is not explicitly identified as a virtual product. Identifying virtual trades explicitly occurs in all the organized Independent System Operator-type markets and confers the benefit of not co-mingling truly physical bids with financial bids. This clear delineation prevents the financial act of speculation from unduly affecting the reliability of the electric system.
Virtual bidding is implemented for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that in its absence there is a tendency for implicit virtual bidding to occur, and the presence of this practice tends to create difficulties for grid operators. There are many benefits of virtual bidding besides the fact that its presence creates an appropriate avenue for arbitrage and in essence assists reliability. The most commonly identified benefits are as follows:
Market power mitigation.
Often generators reside in load pockets where physical competition is constrained due to insufficient transmission. Virtual bidding allows virtual traders to compete to supply power within the constrained area. For this benefit to exist the type of virtual bidding must allow bid submission at the nodal level or at the constrained area level.
Mitigation of the monopsony power of load.
Load is often large enough to influence the market outcome by varying the quantity they bid into the DA market. Virtual bidding mitigates this power by allowing other market participants to simply bid in the load that was under-scheduled.
Mitigation of supplier market power.
The mitigation of supplier (generators) market power is commonly accepted but less well documented. For suppliers to exercise market power they would need to withhold generation in the Day-Ahead market (DAM). This is more difficult in the presence of virtual bidding as virtual traders can submit virtual supply to compete away this withholding practice.
Market efficiency improvements.
The improvements to market efficiency emerge as the prices in the DA and RT markets tend to converge. This makes pricing less volatile and this decrease, albeit small, is the benefit. Prices will not converge completely as there will still be stochastic differences that were not foreseen between DA and RT, but the narrowing of the price spread leads to greater predictability.
Risks of virtual bidding.
The purported benefits of virtual bidding have resulted in it spreading to new ISOs over time. There remain some risks though. The principal risk is that virtual trades will be used to leverage positions in other markets, such as the Financial Transmission Rights market. To prevent this some markets have implemented specific rules to prevent this sort of gaming.
Mechanics of virtual bidding.
The ability to insert virtual bids is usually controlled by the host market, and requires specific registration due to the differing characteristics between virtual bids and physical bids. The submission method is generally similar across Independent System Operators.

Hanns Heinrich Lohmann (24 April 1911 – 25 May 1995) was an Obersturmbannführer (Lieutenant Colonel), in the Waffen SS during World War II, who was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oakleaves.
Early life.
Hanns Heinrich Lohmann was born on 24 April 1911 in Gütersloh. After he finished school he joined the Sparkasse bank in 1929. He also had an interest in athletics, training at the sports schools at Korbach and Essen. During this time he also worked part-time as a police officer in Münster. 
In November 1935 he fractured his left ankle in a sporting accident. After recovering from the injury in 1936, he was promoted to Obersturmführer (First Lieutenant) and posted to the SS-Junkerschule, at Bad Tölz as a lecturer, holding the position of Adjutant from 1937 and completing the Company commanders course at the same time. In November 1938 he was posted to the "Deutschland" Regiment and was promoted to Hauptsturmführer (Captain).
World War II.
Between 1939 and 1940 he was on the staff of the army General staff, before returning to the SS Junkerschule at Bad Tölz for three months as the director of training.
In June 1941 he was given command of the new Regiment "Westland", "Wiking" Division, which was just being formed and took part in the invasion of Russia, (Operation Barbarossa).
In the spring of 1942 Lohmann caught Malaria. Returning to duty in October 1942, he was given command of the I. Battalion, SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment "Nordland", still in the "Wiking" Division which was now fighting in the Caucasus.
The division was involved in some heavy fighting in the Kotenikovo and Simovniki region. They subsequently covered the retreat of Army Group A from the Cacasus. For his part in these actions Lohmann was awarded the German Cross in Gold and promoted to Sturmbannführer (Major) in February 1943.
In May 1943, Lohmann's regiment was being rested in the Grafenwöhr training area, and then was assigned to the 11th SS Division "Nordland". During this time, Lohmann was given command of the III. Battalion, "Norge" Regiment. This should have been an armoured battalion, but due to a lack of equipment and a shortage of SdKfz 251 armoured half tracks, they remained a motorised battalion and saw service in Italy after the Italian surrender and Croatia.
In August 1943, Lohmann was sent on a training course for armoured troops in Paris and on his return the division was relocated to the Oranienbaum sector of the Siege of Leningrad. Lohmann's battalion was involved in the defence of the retreating Sponheimer Group along the Leningrad–Narva Highway and he was wounded on 2 February 1944. It was for his battalion's actions during this time that Lohmann was awarded the Knight's Cross and a promotion to Sturmbannführer (Major).
After he was released from hospital in April 1944 he spent the summer at Bad Tölz on a regimental commanders training course. He was then posted to the Wachbattalion, Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, in Berlin.
At the end of October 1944, he was posted to the III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps and given command of the 49th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment "De Ruyter" part of the 23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland, which was in the Kurland region.
Lohmann was promoted to Obersturmbannführer in January 1945, and joined what was left of his regiment in the Gollnow area.
He was awarded the Oakleaves to the Knight's Cross by order of Generalleutnant Unrein who at the time was the commander of the III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps in February 1945.
Post war.
Lohmann survived the war and died in his home town on 25 May 1995.

Minnesota Correctional Facility – Lino Lakes

The Minnesota Correctional Facility – Lino Lakes (MCF-LL) is a state prison located in Lino Lakes, Minnesota, USA. 
The facility was original built in 1963 as a juvenile facility housing both boys and girls. In 1978 it was remodeled to become a medium security (Custody Level 3) facility for adult male inmates. The original juvenile cottages formed the basis of a "campus style" prison with more than a dozen one or two story buildings now stretched out across the property, fenced in by a high security double fence topped with razor wire.
Buildings range from three of the five original cottages to a new state of the art "K" shaped building that can house 400 offenders. Also on campus is a school and library for offenders working toward a GED or in the adult basic education program. Health Services, a gymnasium, administration, physical plant, chow hall/kitchen, and other housing/treatment units make up the remainder of the buildings.
The prison has no prison industry. Many of the approximately 1,300 inmates are in one of three main types of treatment programs. Sex offender, chemical dependency, and the faith based InnerChange Freedom Initiative are the three main programs. In addition, Lino Lakes is the intake facility for most of the state's release violators returning to prison after violating the conditions of their original release. Many will serve for an additional 30–365 days as a consequence for violating. There is also a small unit that houses and provides therapy for "special needs" offenders who are cognitively disabled and/or significantly mentally ill. There are also some offenders who are not release violators or involved in treatment/therapy. These offenders mostly work full-time in support jobs such as cooks, janitors (swampers), maintenance, grounds crew, and etc.. 
The Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP) treats and houses 200 of the state's most serious sex offenders. The program takes 2 or more years to complete and includes a yearlong chemical dependency treatment program for sex offenders with chemical dependency issues. 
The Triad unit houses and provides chemical dependency treatment to 293 offenders. Triad offers a "therapeutic community" approach to treatment. Triad is also home to the "Special Needs" program.
The InnerChange Freedom Initiative (IFI) is run and staffed by Prison Fellowship, an organization started by former Nixon chief counsel Chuck Colson. While ostensibly open to members of all faiths, it is a Christ centric approach to reentry/rehabilitation for felony offenders.

Hans-Hubert Schönzeler

Hans-Hubert Schönzeler (22 June 192530 April 1997) was a German-born Australian-naturalised English-resident composer, conductor and musicologist who became an authority on Anton Bruckner and Antonín Dvořák.
He was born in Leipzig, an only child, and studied the violin from the age of five. Although his family was not Jewish, he was sent to Brussels so as to avoid contact with the Hitler Youth. In 1939 his family emigrated to Australia where, on the outbreak of the Second World War, his father was interned as an enemy alien. Hans-Hubert went to Sydney Boys High School, but in 1941 he and his mother were also interned for the duration of the war. During these years he continued to study music. He also studied conducting with a former director of the Vienna Boys' Choir. He was released in 1946 and was naturalised as an Australian in 1947. He attended the New South Wales State Conservatorium, where he studied with Eugene Goossens. 
With assistance from Rafael Kubelík, Schönzeler settled in London in 1950, and went to work for Eulenburg Editions. He was later a director of the company. He conducted the 20th-Century Ensemble in London from 1951 to 1962. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire and the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, and worked as a freelance conductor in many countries as well as the UK. He conducted the concert at the Royal Albert Hall in 1964 marking the 10th anniversary of the death of Wilhelm Furtwängler, whose biography he later wrote. In 1967 he commenced a long association with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra. 
Schönzeler became a noted expert on Bruckner: in 1970 he wrote a book on the composer; in 1973 he conducted the world premiere of the first version of the Eighth Symphony; at the 1978 Adelaide Festival he conducted the world premiere of the authentic first version of the Third Symphony. He was honoured by the International Bruckner Society, Vienna, the Bruckner Society of America and he also won the Bruckner Medal Of Honor.
He was also a keen performer of the works of Dvořák; as well as writing a biography, he appeared at the Prague Spring Festival in 1974 and was made an honorary member of the Antonín Dvořák Society in 1975. He also edited symphonies by Joseph Haydn and Carl Maria von Weber.
His recorded legacy includes works by Bruckner, Edmund Rubbra, Sir Arthur Bliss, Mozart and Beethoven.
Hans-Hubert Schonzeler died in England in 1997.

Clarence Hatry

Clarence Charles Hatry (1888–1965) was a company promoter, financier, bankrupt, bookseller and publisher. The fall of the Hatry group in September 1929 is widely credited as a contributing factor to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
Economist John Kenneth Galbraith described Hatry as "one of those curiously un-English figures with whom the English periodically find themselves unable to cope."
Biography.
Before the crash – business.
Hatry began his professional career as an insurance clerk in London's West End. Shrewd fellow-promoters remember that "Clarence" made his first killing in silk, and then recouped the ensuing bankruptcy in insurance, through City Equitable. City Equitable was a modest reinsurance business when it was bought from German and Austrian owners in 1914 for £60,000; Hatry reorganised it in six months and sold a controlling interest for £250,000 to Gerald Lee Bevan and an associate called Peter Haig Thomas.
Hatry found the First World War a chance to profiteer, and by 1921 he was the respected director of 15 corporations.
He had already come to the attention of the American public for a different reason: transporting Eastern European immigrants to the United States and Canada.
In 1924 his Commercial Corporation of London failed for $3.75 million. In some manner, three successive bankruptcies had left him successively richer. He built a new business empire, with investments in photographic supplies, cameras, vending machines, and loan offices.
In early 1929 investors flocked to the Hatry group: General Securities Ltd. (of which Henry Paulet, 16th Marquess of Winchester, was chairman); Austin Friars Trust, Ltd.; Dundee Trust; Oak Investment Corp.; Associated Automatic Machines Corp.; Drapery Trust; Retail Trade Corp.; Photomaton Parent Corp.; and Far Eastern Photomaton Corp.
Photomaton Parent Corporation Limited was set up by Clarence Hatry in 1928 to operate photograph machines in hundreds of public places such as railway stations and amusement parks.
By 1929 he had returned to the top table of corporate finance, and had worked out his greatest project, a merger of steel and iron concerns into the $40 million United Steel Companies. Just as this deal was to be consummated, the Stock Exchange Committee caught him borrowing $1 million on worthless paper. On September 20, 1929, the fraud became known and the Hatry empire collapsed.
Before the crash – personal life.
Hatry was not shy in displaying his wealth: his office suite had ornate bathrooms, he had swimming pools in his Mayfair homes, a yacht, and a racing stable.
Hatry owned the Westward, once the largest yacht in British waters, between 1919 and 1924. He was known to dive from her bowsprit. He was a keen swimmer and remarked: "swimming is the only sport that I, personally, enjoy."
Between 1922 and 1926 Hatry lived at 56 Upper Brook Street, previously occupied by David Ricardo, economist, between 1812 and 1823. Number 56 was built on what was originally an independent plot some forty-one feet in frontage and thirty-three in depth, with a narrow passage at the back from Blackburne's Mews. It was well known as the only house with a rooftop swimming pool in London, where he held bathing-suit parties.
Between 1924 and 1929 Hatry lived at 5 Great Stanhope Street in Mayfair, near the mansion of the daughter of King George V. During his four years at No 5, Hatry spent £70,000 on the house. His improvements were of questionable, though indisputably exuberant, taste, as a contemporary newspaper report recorded: "He installed – among other luxurious things – a swimming bath on the principal bedroom floor, and a stone-floored Tudor-style cocktail bar in the sub-basement." He called the bar "Ye Old Stanhope Arms-Free House." Until his imprisonment, Hatry swam in the pool every morning, throughout the year despite this, he was described as a "sallow, baldish, unhealthy looking little man". Other physical anecdotes include an assertion that he nibbled his food like a woman.
Crash.
Hatry asserted that in late August 1929 he had made a secret visit to the Bank of England to appeal to Montagu Norman for financing to allow him to complete a merger with United Steel Company, a UK firm. Norman had adamantly refused Hatry's bid for a bridge loan. By 17 September, when Hatry stock began to fall on the London exchange, Hatry had liabilities of £19 million and assets of £4 million. On 19 September, after Hatry had approached Lloyds Bank in last a desperate bid for financing, he asked Sir Gilbert Garnsey, a chartered accountant, to intervene on his behalf.
However, Hatry did not tell Garnsey that he had been issuing stocks to try to cover the deal, and some of the stocks were fraudulent – the same certificates had been printed twice and given as security to different leading banks. Hatry had obtained a million dollar loan on forged bearer scrip certificates of City of Wakefield 4½% stock – and an alert clerk had spotted the discrepancy.
Garnsey made a second approach to Norman for emergency financing, and was again rebuffed. By this point Norman had informed the chairman of the London Stock Exchange that the Hatry group was bankrupt; in this conversation it was agreed that trading in Hatry shares would be suspended on 20 September.
On September 20, 1929 the London Stock Exchange committee immediately suspended all shares of the Hatry group, which had been worth about £24 million. On that day Hatry and his leading associates confessed to fraud and forgery in the office of Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and after lunching at the Charing Cross Hotel were jailed.
Nine days later, the Wall Street Crash began.
Trial and conviction.
In late December 1929 Hatry, along with Albert Edward Tabor, Edmund Daniels and Charles Graham Dixon, were tried at the Old Bailey, charged with forgery and fraud. Hatry's friends subscribed $95,000 to pay for his defence.
Hatry, his voice shaking with emotion, said in his defence:
Hatry was jailed in Brixton Prison. The first two years were spent at hard labor. The first two weeks of his sentence he had to sleep on bare boards, and for 28 days he had to crush rocks on the stonepile. After that he was given the slightly less difficult task of making mail bags. He also served a stint as prison librarian.
Hatry was released after serving nine years of his sentence.
Hatry died, aged 76, in 1965.

<doc id="20348535" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20348535" title="Podaxis pistillaris">
Podaxis pistillaris

Podaxis pistillaris is a very distinctive relative of the puffballs. It grows to 15 cm high and has a hard, woody stem. The large cap, which protects the blackish spore-bearing tissue, splits, and usually falls away at maturity, allowing the spores to be dispersed by wind. Large numbers may appear after soaking rains. It thrives in deserts and semi-deserts of Australia and other countries. In the Hawaiian Islands, it is frequently encountered along roadsides and in disturbed areas on the dry sides of the islands, especially in the Kona area of Hawaii and the Kihei area of Maui.
Older synonyms for this species include "Lycoperdon pistillare" L. (1771) and "Scleroderma pistillare" (L.) Pers. (1801).
Spores.
The spores are usually 10–14 (–16) by (8–) 9–12 µm broadly oval to sub-globose, smooth yellow to deep reddish-brown with a double wall, truncate base, and apical pore. Older spore measurements have varied considerably. Species from Australian collections appear to be more subglobose than those seen from the United States, raising the possibility that the latter are not the same species.
Organisation.
It is an agaric, though it has lost hymenophoral organization and the ability to forcibly discharge its basidiospores and become "secotioid". Although considered by many to be a "stalked puffball", "Podaxis pistillaris" is more closely allied with the shaggy mane ("Coprinus comatus") than with puffballs.

Halina Szwarc

Halina Szwarc "de domo" Kłąb (1923–2002) - was a member of the Polish resistance during the Second World War, working undercover first under the pseudonym Ryszard, then Jacek II. Postwar, she became a professor of medicine in gerontology, and in 1970/1971, the prorector of the Józef Piłsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw.
After the outbreak of war, at the age of 16, she joined the Związek Walki Zbronej (ZWZ), the resistance organization that eventually became the Polish Home Army. Under order, she signed the "Volksliste", basing her claim to "Volksdeutsche" status on a German grandmother. She was allowed to finish her schooling in a German language school and in 1940, travelled west into the heart of the Third Reich, ostensibly to further her education. She would, in fact, be spying for the ZWZ. She conducted operations in Vienna, Berlin, Munich, and other major German cities. Szwarc’s greatest contribution to the war effect was her surveying of military installations in Hamburg, making possible their destruction by Allied bombers. Later, she took a job in the Berlin Archive of Army Medicine, where she was able to collect invaluable information concerning German troop positions on the Eastern Front.
In 1944, following her return to her home town of Łodź, she was arrested by the Gestapo. She was tortured and condemned to death by firing squad. Fortunately, the sentence was not carried out.
After the war, she finished her medical studies and began to work in the clinic of the Poznan University of Medical Sciences. Like other members of the Home Army, Szwarc was viewed as a possible traitor by the new Communist regime. Despite continual persecution by the security service and other forms of repression in Stalinist Poland, she managed to advance her academic career. In 2000, she was honored with the Order of Polonia Restituta for her achievements in the medical field.

Academic studies of the political groups of the European Parliament

Academic studies of the political groups of the European Parliament refers to the studies of those groups by academics, the methods that they use and the conclusions that they reach.
Background.
The political groups of the European Parliament have been around in one form or another since September 1952 and the first meeting of the Parliament's predecessor, the Common Assembly. The groups are coalitions of MEPs and the Europarties and national parties that those MEPs belong to. The groups have coalesced into representations of the dominant schools of European political thought and are the primary actors in the Parliament. 
Some of the groups (such as PES) have become homogeneous units coterminous with their Europarty, some (such as IND/DEM) have not. But they are still coalitions, not parties in their own right, and do not issue manifestos of their own. It may therefore be difficult to discern how the groups intend to vote without first inspecting the party platforms of their constituent parties, and then with limited certainty. 
Additionally, national media focus on the MEPs/national parties of their own member state, neglecting the group's activities and poorly understanding their structure or even existence. Transnational media coverage of the groups "per se" is limited to those organs such as the Parliament itself, or those news media (e.g. EUObserver or theParliament.com) that specialise in the Parliament. These organs cover the groups in detail but with little overarching analysis. So although such organs make it easy to find out how a group acted on a specific vote, they provide little information on the voting patterns of a specific group.
As a result, the only bodies providing analysis of the voting patterns and Weltanschauung of the groups are academics.
Academics.
Academics analysing the groups include Simon Hix (London School of Economics and Political Science), Abdul Noury (Free University of Brussels), Gérard Roland, (University of California, Berkeley), Gail McElroy (Trinity College, Dublin, Department of Political Science), Kenneth Benoit (Trinity College, Dublin - Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS)), Friedrich Heinemann, Philipp Mohl, and Steffen Osterloh (University of Mannheim - Centre for European Economic Research).
Results.
Positions on economy and euroscepticism.
[[Image:Hix-Lord model for EP 6 (June 2004 to December 2006 period) by roll-call votes.png|thumb|Hix-Lord model for first half of the Sixth Parliament (see description for sources)
Table 3 of the 3 January 2008 version of a working paper from the London School of Economics/Free University of Brussels by Hix and Nouri considered the positions of the groups in the Sixth Parliament (2004-2009) by analysing their roll-call votes. The results for each group are shown in the diagram on the right. The vertical scale is anti-pro Europe spectrum, (0% = extremely anti-Europe, 100% = extremely pro), and the horizontal scale is economic left-right spectrum, (0% = extremely economically left-wing, 100% = extremely economically right-wing). The results are also shown in the table below.
Two of the groups (EPP-ED and IND/DEM) were split. EPP-ED are split on Euroscepticism: the EPP subgroup ( ) were centre-right Europhiles, whereas the ED subgroup ( ) were right-wing Eurosceptics.
IND/DEM was also split along its subgroups: the reformist subgroup ( , bottom-center) voted as centrist Eurosceptics, and the secessionist subgroup ( , middle-right) voted as right-wing Euroneutrals. The reformist subgroup was able to pursue a reformist agenda via the Parliament. The secessionist subgroup was unable to pursue a secessionist agenda there (it's out of the Parliament's purview) and pursued a right-wing agenda instead. Ironically, this resulted in the secessionist subgroup being "less" eurosceptic in terms of roll-call votes than other, non-eurosceptic parties. UKIP (the major component of the secessionist subgroup) was criticised for this seeming abandonment of its Eurosceptic core principles.
Group cooperation.
Table 3 of the 21 August 2008 version of the same working paper gave figures for the level of cooperation between each group (how many times they vote with a group, and how many times they vote against) for the Fifth and Sixth Parliaments. The results are given in the tables below, where 0% = never votes with, 100% = always votes with.
EUL/NGL and G/EFA voted closely together, as did PES and ALDE, and EPP-ED and UEN. Surprisingly, given that PES and EPP-ED are partners in the Grand Coalition, they were not each other's closest allies, although they did vote with each other about two-thirds of the time. IND/DEM did not have close allies within the political groups, preferring instead to cooperate most closely with the Non-Inscrits.
Group positions.
Table 2 of a 2005 discussion paper from the Institute for International Integration Studies by Gail McElroy and Kenneth Benoit analysed the group positions between April and June 2004, at the end of the Fifth Parliament and immediately before the 2004 elections. The results are given below, with 0% = extremely against, 100% = extremely for (except for the left-right spectrum, where 0% = extremely left-wing, 100% = extremely right-wing)
EUL/NGL and G/EFA were the most left-wing groups, UEN and EDD the most right-wing, and that was mirrored in their attitudes towards taxation, homosexual equality, abortion, euthanasia and controlling migration into the EU. The groups fell into two distinct camps regarding further development of EU authority, with UEN and EDD definitely against and the rest broadly in favor. Opinion was wider on the CFSP, with only PES, ELDR and EPP-ED in favor and the others against. Unsurprisingly, G/EFA was far more in favor of Green issues compared to the other groups.
Attitude to EU tax.

Table 1 of an April 2008 discussion paper from the Centre for European Economic Research by Heinemann et al. analysed each Group's stance on a hypothetical generalised EU tax. The results for each Group are given in the diagram on the right with the horizontal scale scaled so that -100% = totally against and 100% = totally for. The results are also given in the table below, rescaled so that 0% = totally against, 100% = totally for.
G/EFA and PES were in favor of such a tax, IND/DEM and the Independents were definitely against, the others had no clear position.
Group cohesion.
[[Image:Faas 2002 Group cohesion in the European Parliament.PNG|thumb|2002 Group cohesion (see description for sources).
"Cohesion" is the term used to define whether a Group is united or divided amongst itself. Figure 1 of a 2002 paper from European Integration online Papers (EIoP) by Thorsten Faas analysed the Groups as they stood in 2002. 
The results for each Group are given in the diagram on the right with the horizontal scale scaled so that 0% = totally split, 100% = totally united. The results are also given in the table below.
G/EFA, PES and ELDR were the most united groups, with EDD the most disunited.
Proportion of female MEPs.
[[Image:Stokes 2006 Gender balance by European Parliament group.PNG|thumb|2006 Group gender balance (see description for sources).
The March 2006 edition of "Social Europe: the journal of the European Left" included a chapter called "Women and Social Democratic Politics" by Wendy Stokes. That chapter gave the proportion of female MEPs in each Group in the European Parliament. The results for each Group are given in the diagram on the right. The horizontal scale denotes gender balance (0% = totally male, 100% = totally female, but no Group has a female majority, so the scale stops at 50%). The results are also given in the table below.
G/EFA, PES and ALDE were the most balanced groups in terms of gender, with IND/DEM the most unbalanced.
Attitude to Turkish accession.
Martin Olof Persson's D-uppsats thesis for the Luleå University of Technology entitled "Turkey as a member of the European Union: a discourse analysis of the views presented in the European Parliament" considered each group's attitude towards Turkish accession. The results of that thesis are given in the table below.
G/EFA, PES, EUL/NGL and ALDE supported Turkish accession either now or later, EPP-ED, IND/DEM and ITS permanently rejected it, and UEN's position was unknown.
Group switching.
Party group switching in the European Parliament is the phenomenon where parliamentarians individually or collectively switch from one party group to the other. The phenomenon of EP party group switching is a well-known contributor to the volatility of the EP party system and highlights the fluidity that characterizes the composition of European parliamentary groups. On average 9% of all MEPs switch during legislative terms. Party group switching is a phenomenon that gained force especially in the legislatures during the 1990s, up to a maximum of 18% for the 1989-1994 term, with strong prevalence among representatives from France and Italy, though by no means limited to those two countries. There is a clear tendency of party group switches from the ideological extremes, both left and right, toward the center. Most switching takes place at the outset of legislative terms, with another peak around the half-term moment, when responsibilities rotate within the EP hierarchy.

Rugby League Four Nations

The Rugby League Four Nations is an annual rugby league football tournament run in partnership between the Australian Rugby League Commission, Rugby Football League and New Zealand Rugby League representing the top three nations in the sport: Australia, England and New Zealand. A fourth partner, France, accepted an invitation to play in the inaugural tournament. In the 2010 Tournament, Papua New Guinea was represented as they won the 2009 Pacific Cup. In 2011 they were replaced by the 2010 European Cup winners, Wales. The tournament is sponsored by Gillette and therefore officially known as the Gillette Four Nations.
The tournament was first contested in 2009 and replaced the Tri-Nations tournament that previously involved Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain.
The Four Nations is an integrated part of the Rugby League International Federation's 'International Calendar', with the fourth participant for 2010 and 2011 decided by the 2009 Pacific Cup and 2010 European Cups respectively.

<doc id="20348693" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20348693" title="NBA Store">
NBA Store

The NBA Store is a series of officially licensed retailers which sell merchandise for the National Basketball Association (NBA). The most prominent of these stores was located in the United States on Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street, Manhattan, New York. There are two other locations in Beijing, China.
The New York location sold many basketball related items and featured several attractions; it was often visited by transient players, celebrities, and political leaders. It also served as a headquarters for the NBA where the association hosts charity events.
Since opening its first store in 1998, the NBA has seen increasing business opportunities in foreign markets mainly due to the influx of new international players. The biggest growth has been in China, where players Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian, combined with the interest generated by the 2008 Summer Olympics, created enough demand to open two new stores. The NBA has also expanded into games like Second Life where it created a virtual NBA Store in 2007.
The original Fifth Avenue store closed on February 13, 2011. The league temporarily relocated the store in a smaller space at 590 Fifth Avenue. The league is searching for a new permanent location.
New York City.
Established in the fall of 1998, the store offers free video games, a regulation basketball court, and other attractions like a life-size Shaquille O'Neal bobblehead. Among its many products, the store sells current NBA & WNBA jerseys, replica jerseys of retired players, footwear, collectibles, photography, and other gifts. It has several departments, such as a home section, where customers can buy items like pillows, plates, and other NBA related items.
NBA employees, including players, receive a 30% discount on their purchases. 
The most expensive item for sale is a $75,000 signed "framed photo collage" of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.
Construction involved removing beams to make space for an 36-by-54-foot hole in the bottom three floors of the existing 41 story building.
Steve Candeloro has been the store's concierge since it opened in 1998. The store is frequently visited by celebrities, tourists, and NBA players who are in town to play the New York Knicks or New Jersey Nets. The NBA Store has been visited by important guests such as former President Bill Clinton, and the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, who received a personal tour by NBA Commissioner David Stern. The store is also host to The NBA Store Concert Series, concert events where musical artists perform at the store's half court; some previous performers include: Michelle Branch, Destiny's Child, Run DMC, and Aaron Carter.
The NBA Store in New York City allowed its customers to rent areas for birthday parties or other private celebrations and has hosted charity events in the past. During Christmas 2006, the wife of NBA player Dwyane Wade volunteered at the NBA Store Holiday Toy Drive.
The New York Knicks regularly held events like Autographs for Supplies at the NBA Store where New York players like Eddy Curry, Zach Randolph, and WNBA's Kym Hampton meet fans and signs items in an effort to raise school supplies for children and stress academics. In 2007, the store held a fashion exhibition to celebrate the Casual Male Retail Group acquisition of the men's big & tall clothing company "Jared M.", a company popular among athletes and celebrities for its custom sportswear; several NBA players were happy to show their support since the founder had fitted many of them in the past.
In 2007, the most sold team paraphernalia were from the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks, and the 2006 NBA champions the Miami Heat. The following year, the Lakers and Knicks retained their top spots, but the Heat were replaced by the new 2008 NBA champions the Boston Celtics.
The NBA Store's main outlet in New York was closed in February 13, 2011 due to high rent. "The amount of dollars the landlord is requiring from the next tenant, we couldn't find a way to make it work," NBA executive vice president of global merchandising Sal LaRocca said. While the league searches for a new location the store will operate temporarily at 590 Fifth Avenue.
Beijing, China.
The NBA also sells its products outside the United States, most notably in China. The NBA's international operations only provide 10 percent of total profit; however, the NBA has seen a recent increase in possible business opportunities abroad.
Statistics revealed that 300 million out of China's 1.3 billion population played basketball, additionally "83 per cent of males between 15 to 61 years old are interested in the game," and the NBA was reported to be "the most popular sports league in the country."
In 2006, it was reported that the NBA was planning to open its first store in Beijing, China (on Wangfujing Street) or Shanghai, China.
Partly due to Yao Ming (1st overall pick in 2002) and Yi Jianlian's (6th overall pick in 2007) popularity in their home country, the NBA now sells its products in some 30,000 to 50,000 retail locations in China. During the 2006 season the NBA broadcast its games in 215 countries and had 83 foreign players, about a quarter of the total players. In 2008, it had 75 players from 32 different countries.
On January 14, 2008, the NBA announced the formation of NBA China ("a joint venture of the NBA, broadcaster ESPN and Chinese companies"), "that will conduct all of the league’s businesses in Greater China", the new entity will be led by Tim Chen (former CEO of Microsoft Greater China).
In preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics in China, the NBA opened a flagship store in Beijing; the JuneYao Group was chosen to lead marketing operations for the retail chain-store.
The NBA currently has two stores in China (both in Beijing) and according to CEO Chen plans to expand "up to 1,000 in the next five years." The first store was opened on July 15, 2008; it has "300 square meters of retail space" and sells about 400 different items;
about 1,000 people showed up for the opening. According to the "International Herald Tribune", merchandise sales in China were expected to increase by 60 percent in 2008. About one third of the traffic received at nba.com comes from their Chinese area (china.nba.com) written in Mandarin built by the Plus Factory, a New York City firm with offices in Beijing.
Reports on NBA jersey sales over the last three years (2006–2009) reveal that Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is the most sold jersey in China; however, Yao Ming fell from 6th to 10th and then back to 6th while his Houston Rockets teammate Tracy McGrady remained ranked third for two straight seasons then fell to fourth in 2009.
Second Life.
The MMORPG Second Life, an Internet-based virtual game world, offers its members the option of playing or shopping at a digital replica of the NBA Store. The 3-D virtual replica was launched on May 1, 2007, during the NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and the Cleveland Cavaliers as a way of reaching the global audience and expanding the NBA's business in the virtual world. The virtual NBA Store is part of the NBA's virtual headquarters; other facilities include a T-Mobile arena where player's avatars can take pictures or watch Finals footage on a JumboTron. At the time of its launch, the NBA was the "first professional sports league to unveil a comprehensive headquarters in a virtual world." The virtual store's entrance is modeled after the New York City location, featuring the same double revolving doors and gold NBA lettering.
In 2004, the NBA Live series for home video game consoles introduced an EA NBA Store feature, where players can purchase digital shoes and jerseys with points earned through the completion of in-game tasks.

North Forest High School

North Forest High School (NFHS) is a secondary school located in Houston, Texas, United States. The school is a part of the Houston Independent School District; it was a part of the North Forest Independent School District until the district closed on July 1, 2013.
History.
Founded in 2008 as a consolidation of Forest Brook High School at 7525 Tidwell Road and M. B. Smiley High School on Mesa Drive, the school was originally located on the campus of the former Forest Brook High School. 
The Smiley campus was built in 1953, the Oak Village campus was built in 1967, and the Forest Brook campus was built in 1972. In September of that year Hurricane Ike hit Houston and Forest Brook was damaged. Therefore, the school was relocated to the former Smiley campus.
In the 2010-2011 school year, NFISD opened the Ninth Grade Center at the former Oak Village Middle School campus. The Ninth Grade Center houses newly arrived ninth graders. People repeating the ninth grade attend the main campus of North Forest High School. It opened under the direction of the Texas Education Agency (TEA)-appointed manager George McShan.
In January 2012 the school had 1,285 students. In January 2012 an 18-year old male student shot a 16-year old male student. The perpetrator evaded the school's usage of metal detectors for incoming students. After the shooting, the school began requiring all students to have transparent backpacks. NFISD planned to extend the school's metal detector hours to 10 AM.
Campus.
North Forest High School consists of a main campus and a ninth grade center. The Ninth Grade Center is in the former Oak Village Middle School, and it shares the campus with YES Prep North Forest. The Jones Cowart Stadium is on the property of NFHS.
After the July 1, 2013 closure of NFISD, on the North Forest High School main campus, Houston Independent School District officials found a room with a cabinet with Lenox china, a grandfather clock, furnishings, a green carpet, and flowered wallpaper. Ericka Mellon of the "Houston Chronicle" said that the room "looked like it belonged in a house, not a public school."
The library on the main campus, the Carole M. Anderson Library, has 33 magazine titles and over 13,000 books. It was named after Carole Mae Anderson, a Smiley High School English teacher who donated books to the school's previous library facility.
Academic performance.
In a six-year period until 2011, North Forest High was consistently ranked "academically unacceptable" by the Texas Education Agency.
The dropout rate of the Class of 2011 was slightly above 30 percent.
Dress code.
Since 2011, North Forest High has had a school uniform standard dress policy.

Emergency aircraft evacuation

Emergency aircraft evacuation refers to emergency evacuation from an aircraft which may take place on the ground, in water, or mid-flight. There are standard evacuation procedures and special evacuation equipment.
Commercial airplanes.
Commercial aircraft are equipped with aircraft safety cards detailing evacuation procedures. These include locating and using emergency exits, using slides and flotation devices for water landings, etc.
Ejection seats.
In aircraft, an ejection seat is a system designed to rescue the pilot or other crew of an aircraft (usually military) in an emergency. In most designs, the seat is propelled out of the aircraft by an explosive charge or rocket motor, carrying the pilot with it. The concept of an ejectable escape capsule has also been tried. Once clear of the aircraft, the ejection seat deploys a parachute.
Parachutes.
Parachutes are designed to allow people to exit aircraft mid-flight and safely land on the ground by creating drag to slow descent.

No value added

No Value Added (NVA) is a management term loosely related to the Lean Manufacturing movement as codified in the 1980s by a landmark MIT study of the automobile industry, which explained lean production for the first time.
No Value Added programs can be formal or whimsical. Generally, they involved seeking input and opinion from every level of the organization about rules, processes or process elements which are said to be “no value added.”
In one form, the proponent of an activity accused of being NVA must defend it, or suspend it.
In a milder form, the proponent (or process owner) of an activity accused of being NVA is simply informed that it is seen in that light. Oddly, this milder form is often effective because in a large organization, the original reason for an activity can be long forgotten, similar to "cabooses" which came into use in the 1830s, but eventually had no useful purpose and became NVA.
Some claim that this NVA is a jibe at "Net Value Added" accounting methods, which were held in low esteem by some Lean advocates, and high esteem by others.

Joe Potts

Joe Potts was a Scottish racing driver, turned racing car manufacturer, of the 1950s. He designed and constructed his 'JP' racing cars for the Formula 3 and Formule Libre racing classes. These remain the only single-seater racing cars to come from Scotland.
Background.
In the late 19th century an Irish immigrant by the name of Joseph Potts settled in Bellshill, Lanarkshire, and founded the company that bears his name. Amongst other lines of business he hired out horse-drawn carriages, one of his customers being a local undertaker. Potts was later to take over this funeral director's business, and modify his carriages so that they could be used as a hearse when necessary.
Potts' grandson - also Joseph, or Joe - is the subject of this article. He expanded the business's engineering offshoot in the mid-1930s, first by supplying motorcycle components and then, with the Second World War, by producing specialist armament parts.
After the war, the funeral directorship and engineering works continued side-by-side.
Joe Potts continued to develop motorbikes, running a highly successful team of racers, and then started to compete in races and hill climbs in his Cooper F3 car. Believing that the Cooper could be bettered, he and his chief designer Willie Rogerson set about designing and building their own 'JP' F3 cars in 1950. The precise number built over the next five years is not certain, but they are thought to number around 34.
The company continued to undertake engineering projects until Joe's death in 1982.

HIV/AIDS in New Zealand

There is a relatively low prevalence of HIV/AIDS in New Zealand. The rate of newly diagnosed HIV infections was stable at around 100 annually through the late 1980s and the 1990s, but rose sharply from 2000 to 2005. It has since stabilised at roughly 180 new cases annually. Male-to-male sexual contact has been the largest contributor to new HIV cases in New Zealand since record began in 1985. Heterosexual contact is the second largest contributor to new cases, but unlike male-to-male contact, they are mostly acquired outside of New Zealand.
The first recorded death in New Zealand due to AIDS was in New Plymouth in 1983.
In 1985 Eve van Grafhorst was ostracised in Australia since she had contracted HIV/AIDS caused by a transfusion of infected blood. The family moved to New Zealand where she died at the age of 11. By the time of her death her plight had significantly raised the level of AIDS awareness in New Zealand.
World AIDS Day is observed in New Zealand.
Organisations.
The Ministry of Health is the government department which deals with health issues, including HIV/AIDS.
The New Zealand AIDS Foundation is a registered charitable trust which focuses on prevention of AIDS in the most at risk group, namely men who have sex with men.

Lawrence La Fountain-Stokes

Lawrence La Fountain-Stokes (born April 10, 1968) is a gay Puerto Rican author, scholar, and performer. He is better known as Larry La Fountain. He has received several awards for his creative writing and scholarship as well as for his work with Latino and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students. He currently resides in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Life.
La Fountain-Stokes was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, specifically in Miramar, a traditional neighborhood located in the central district of Santurce. He was adopted at birth by Donald and Ramona La Fountain, and is the brother of the ESPN newscaster Michele La Fountain. He has written about his childhood experiences in an essay called "Los nenes con los nenes y las nenas con las nenas" with Girls, and Boys with Boys, where he describes his childhood home as bilingual and bicultural, as he was raised speaking English and Spanish. His essay "Queer Diasporas, Boricua Lives: A Meditation on Sexile" also discusses some of these early experiences.
La Fountain-Stokes received all of his primary and secondary education at the Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, an elite bilingual school run by the School Sisters of Notre Dame. He graduated from high school in 1986. He then studied at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Hispanic Studies in 1991. While in college, La Fountain-Stokes spent a year and a half studying at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. He later went on to obtain a Master’s degree and Doctorate in Spanish from Columbia University in New York City.
La Fountain-Stokes started his teaching career as an assistant professor at the Ohio State University (1998–1999) and then taught at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey for four years (1999–2003). Since 2003, he has taught Latino studies, American studies, and Spanish at the University of Michigan, including courses on queer Hispanic Caribbean culture, LGBT studies and Latino literature, theater, performance, and film. He was promoted to associate professor with tenure in 2009. His interviews in Spanish with leading Latino artists, journalists, and scholars such as the Uruguayan novelist and pop singer Dani Umpi and the "Los Angeles Times" journalist Sam Quiñones appear on the "University of Michigan in Spanish" channel on YouTube and on iTunes U.
Scholarly works.
La Fountain-Stokes's academic writing has focused mostly on queer Puerto Rican culture. His book "Queer Ricans: Cultures and Sexualities in the Diaspora" (University of Minnesota Press, 2009) discusses LGBT Puerto Rican migration from a cultural studies perspective, with chapters on Luis Rafael Sánchez, Manuel Ramos Otero, Luz María Umpierre, Frances Negrón-Muntaner, Rose Troche, Erika Lopez, Arthur Aviles, and Elizabeth Marrero. "Queer Ricans" is based on La Fountain-Stokes's Ph.D. dissertation, which he wrote under the supervision of Jean Franco. The author received funding for this project in 1997 from the International Migration Program at the Social Science Research Council.
He is currently working on a new book titled "Translocas and Transmachas: Trans Diasporic Puerto Rican Drag" which is on Puerto Rican and diasporic theater, performance, and activism since the 1960s, and on the links between cross-dressing, sex/gender modification, and physical displacement in a geographic zone marked by frequent migrations. In this project, La Fountain-Stokes analyzes the work of a number of contemporary performers and activists including Sylvia Rivera, Holly Woodlawn, Mario Montez, Freddie Mercado, Jorge Merced, Eduardo Alegría, Javier Cardona, Lady Catiria, Elizabeth Marrero, and Erika Lopez. He has another less developed book project on the use of animal words such as "pato" (duck in Spanish) to refer to homosexuality in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.
La Fountain-Stokes has published scholarly articles in journals such as "CENTRO Journal", "Revista Iberoamericana", and "", including his essay on his travels to Cuba, "De un pájaro las dos alas," which first appeared in "GLQ" in 2002 and was reprinted in "Our Caribbean: A Gathering of Lesbian and Gay Writing from the Antilles", edited by the Jamaican American gay writer Thomas Glave. La Fountain-Stokes describes this article as a "fictionalized, experimental narrative or autoethnography based on travel experiences as a gay Puerto Rican theater critic and former graduate student."
La Fountain-Stokes frequently publishes short newspaper articles in Spanish, particularly in "En Rojo", the cultural supplement of the Puerto Rican weekly "Claridad". These include theater and performance reviews, book reviews, and essays on popular culture, such as his piece on a calendar by the popular Puerto Rican male model and former police officer Peter Hance. La Fountain-Stokes is also a frequent speaker at professional meetings and college campuses, and has talked about his work in several countries, including Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Venezuela, and Spain. He has also been actively involved in a number of professional organizations, particularly the Modern Language Association, the Latin American Studies Association, the Puerto Rican Studies Association, the Caribbean Studies Association, and the City University of New York Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies (CLAGS), holding positions of leadership in several of these.
Creative works.
La Fountain-Stokes is best known as an author of short stories, but he has also published poetry and received awards for his plays. His first book of fiction, "Uñas pintadas de azul/Blue Fingernails" (Bilingual Press/Editorial Bilingüe, 2009), includes 14 short stories written in the 1990s and early 2000s, some of them while the author was enrolled in a creative writing workshop taught by the Chilean author Diamela Eltit. His second book, "Abolición del pato", was published by Terranova Editores in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 2013. His fiction has also appeared in a number of anthologies such as "Bésame Mucho: New Gay Latino Fiction" (1999), "Los otros cuerpos: Antología de temática gay, lésbica y queer desde Puerto Rico y su diáspora" (2007), and "From Macho to Mariposa: New Gay Latino Fiction" (2011). He has also published in journals and websites such as "Blithe House Quarterly" and "Harrington Gay Men’s Fiction Quarterly".
Most of La Fountain-Stokes's stories focus on gay Puerto Rican characters, and sometimes incorporate elements of science fiction and fantasy. The scholar Enrique Morales-Díaz has written extensively about one of these stories, "My Name, Multitudinous Mass," describing La Fountain-Stokes as a "Diasporican" author.
La Fountain-Stokes's plays include "¡Escándalo!" (2003) and "Uñas pintadas de azul" (2006, an extension of a short story included in his book of short stories). Both of these plays have been read publicly as part of the Pregones Theater Asunción Playwrights Project in the Bronx, but neither one has been staged.
Performance.
La Fountain-Stokes has done solo and ensemble performance for stage and video. In 2004 he did a one-man show, "Abolición del pato/Abolition of the Duck", as part of the Casa Cruz de la Luna First Experimental Festival in San Germán, Puerto Rico, and later at the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (BAAD!) Out Like That Festival. The main character of this piece is Lola Lolamento Mentosán de San Germán, who is accompanied by Rigoberta Quetzal and the ñusta Isabel Chimpu Ocllo. The "Village Voice" described "Abolition of the Duck" as "This is not Avenue Q" in reference to the artist's use of indigenous dolls as puppets to talk about Puerto Rican homosexuality. Starting in 2010, he has collaborated with Fausto Fernós and Marc Felion of the Feast of Fun podcast in the making of a series of YouTube videos titled "Cooking with Drag Queens", in which Lola von Miramar (La Fountain-Stokes's persona) makes Puerto Rican delicacies such as tostones and coquito together with Saltina Obama Bouvier (Fernós) and Daphne DuMount (Felion). He has also done solo videos, also available on YouTube.

Helen (novel)

Helen is a novel by Maria Edgeworth (1767–1849). It was written in 1834, late in the writer's life, and was her last work.
Synopsis.
"Helen" tells the story of a young orphan, Helen Stanley, whose guardian, Dean Stanley, has squandered his fortune and left Helen without means of support. She is forced to take up residence with the local vicar, whose wife is astonished that none of the Stanleys' aristocratic friends have offered a refuge to her. Eventually, however, the Davenant family returns from abroad and invite Helen to their daughter's new home, Clarendon Park. (Cecilia Davenant has just married General Clarendon.) Helen journeys to join her dear friend Cecilia, and the first half of the novel describes Helen's experiences among the most fortunate of Britain's elite under the tutelage of Lady Davenant, who in some ways favors Helen over her own daughter Cecilia.
In the second and more dramatic half of the novel, Lady Davenant departs with her husband, who has been named ambassador at the Court of St. Petersburg, Russia. Helen is left to the care of General Clarendon and Cecilia. By this time she is engaged to Granville Beauclerc, a young and handsome man who is another of Lady Davenant's favorites. All does not run smoothly for Helen, however. Before her marriage, Cecilia has carried on an amorous correspondence with Colonel d'Aubigny, a worthless roué who has since died. These letters reappear in a packet addressed to Cecilia's husband. Cecilia implores Helen to act as if the letters were addressed to her rather than to Cecilia. Helen, from misguided devotion to her friend and gratitude for Cecilia's kind hospitality, agrees to the deception. This first step leads to more and more serious consequences, until finally Helen's reputation is in tatters. Beauclerc is forced to fight a duel in defense of his fiancée, after which he must flee from England. Cecilia still refuses to recognize the letters as hers, out of fear of losing her own husband if she admits to the correspondence. The General is convinced that Helen is faithless. She refuses to stay where she is not respected and chooses exile in Wales with the General's sister, where she becomes dangerously ill. Even the birth of Cecilia's first child, a son, does not encourage her to confess to her husband, and Helen gives up all hope of exoneration. The dénouement comes when Lady Davenant, also dangerously ill, returns to London at the same time as the General finally discovers his wife's deception and vows to separate from Cecilia for life. Helen's character is redeemed, Beauclerc returns to England when his adversary recovers from his wounds, and the novel ends happily for all the protagonists with Lady Davenant saying that she is "now, and not till now, happy--perfectly happy in Love and Truth!"
Criticism.
Here is what one biographer of Maria Edgeworth has to say about "Helen."
"It was in 1830–when already past sixty years of age–that Miss Edgeworth set to work upon the last, and what, at the time it was written, was possibly the most successful of all her novels–namely, Helen. Any reader who will take it down from its shelf, and glance over it, will quickly perceive that it is a novel of a very much more modern type than any other by the same hand. In reading it we are aware that the eighteenth century has at last dropped out of sight, and that we are well out upon the nineteenth, not indeed as yet 'Victorian', but in a sort of midway region, on the road to that superior epoch."

Bihar Legislative Council

Bihar Vidhan Parishad is also known as Bihar Legislative Council
History.
A new Province of Bihar and Orissa was created by the British Government on 12 December 1911. The Legislative Council with a total of 43 members belonging to different categories was formed in 1912. The first sitting of the Council was convened on 20 January 1913. In 1936, Bihar attained its separate Statehood. Under the Government of India Act, 1919, the unicameral legislature got converted into bicameral one, i.e. the Bihar Legislative Council and the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Under the Government of India Act, 1935, the Bihar Legislative Council consisted of 29 members. After the first General Elections 1952, the number of members was increased up to 72 and by 1958 the number was raised to 96. With the creation of Jharkhand, as a result of the Bihar Re-organisation Act, 2000 passed by the Parliament, the strength of the Bihar Legislative Council has been reduced from 96 to 75 members.
Working.
Bihar Legislative Council is a permanent body and not subject to dissolution. But as nearly as possible, one-third of the members thereof retire as soon as may be on the expiration of every second year. Members are now elected or nominated for six years and one-sixth of them retire every second year. The presiding officers of Vidhan Parishad are now known as Chairman and Deputy Chairman. Members of the upper house, the Legislative Council are indirectly elected through an electoral college.
There are 27 Committees which are, at present, functional in the Council. Besides, there are three Financial Committees consisting of the members of the two Houses of the State Legislature.

Vietnam War POW/MIA issue

The Vietnam War POW/MIA issue concerns the fate of United States servicemen who were reported as missing in action (MIA) during the Vietnam War and associated theaters of operation in Southeast Asia. The term has also referenced issues related to the treatment of affected family members by the governments involved in these conflicts. Following the Paris Peace Accords of 1973, 591 American prisoners of war (POWs) were returned during Operation Homecoming. The U.S. listed about 1,350 Americans as prisoners of war or missing in action and roughly 1,200 Americans reported killed in action and body not recovered. Many of these were airmen who were shot down over North Vietnam or Laos. Investigations of these incidents have involved determining whether the men involved survived their shoot down; if they did not survive, then they considered efforts to recover their remains. POW/MIA activists played a role in pushing the U.S. government to improve its efforts in resolving the fates of the missing. Progress in doing so was slow until the mid-1980s, when relations between the U.S. and Vietnam began to improve and more cooperative efforts were undertaken. Normalization of U.S. relations with Vietnam in the mid-1990s was a culmination of this process.
Considerable speculation and investigation has gone to a hypothesis that a significant number of these men were captured as prisoners of war by Communist forces in the two countries and kept as live prisoners after the war's conclusion for the United States in 1973. A vocal group of POW/MIA activists maintains that there has been a concerted conspiracy by the Vietnamese government and every American government since then to hide the existence of these prisoners. The U.S. government has steadfastly denied that prisoners were left behind or that any effort has been made to cover up their existence. Popular culture has reflected the "live prisoners" theory, most notably in the 1985 film "". Several congressional investigations have looked into the issue, culminating with the largest and most thorough, the United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs of 1991–1993 led by Senators John Kerry, Bob Smith, and John McCain. It found "no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia."
The fate of those missing in action has always been one of the most troubling and unsettling consequences of any war. In this case, the issue has been a highly emotional one to those involved, and is often considered the last depressing, divisive aftereffect of the Vietnam War for the United States.
Origins.
The origins of the POW/MIA issue date back to during the war itself. Suffering from a lack of accurate intelligence sources inside North Vietnam, the U.S. never had solid knowledge for how many American prisoners of war were held. Indeed, the U.S. often relied upon possibly inaccurate North Vietnamese newspapers and radio broadcasts to find out who had been captured, as well as memorized lists of names brought out by the few American POWs given early release. As the Department of Defense built up lists of those in the categories of killed in action, killed in action/body not recovered, prisoner of war, and missing in action, its tentative numbers fluctuated, but most of the time, the number of expected returnees upon war's end was around 600. However, the Nixon administration had made return of the POWs one of its central arguments to the American public for prolonging the war and bringing North Vietnam to terms. In doing so, the administration exaggerated the number of POWs at issue, at one point stating that there were "fifteen hundred American servicemen" held throughout Southeast Asia. These higher numbers would be the focus of much of the controversy in the issue to come.
Following the Paris Peace Accords of January 1973, U.S. prisoners of war were returned during Operation Homecoming during February through April 1973. During this, 591 POWs were released to U.S. authorities; this included a few captured in Laos and released in North Vietnam. U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that all U.S. servicemen taken prisoner had been accounted for. At that time, the U.S. listed about 1,350 Americans as prisoners of war or missing in action and sought the return of roughly 1,200 Americans reported killed in action and body not recovered. The low numbers of returnees from Laos caused some immediate concern, as previous Pentagon estimates were as high as 41 for prisoners held there, although only a few had been known to be captured for certain. 
Investigation of the fate of all the missing service personnel would end up residing with the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office. The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command also played a major role in subsequent investigations. In 1973, the Defense Department established the Central Identification Laboratory–Thailand to coordinate POW/MIA recovery efforts in Southeast Asia.
The U.S. conducted some limited operations in South Vietnam in 1974 to find the remains of those missing, and pursuant to the Paris Accords, the North Vietnamese returned some remains too. These efforts halted following the collapse of the Accords and the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, and over the next ten years, little progress was made in recovering remains.
During the late 1970s and 1980s, the friends and relatives of unaccounted-for American personnel became politically active, requesting the United States government reveal what steps were taken to follow up on intelligence regarding last-known-alive MIAs and POWs. When initial inquiries revealed important information had not been pursued, many families and their supporters asked for the public release of POW/MIA records and called for an investigation.
In 1979, the re-emergence of U.S. Private First Class Bobby Garwood constituted the only POW to surface following the end of the war and release of prisoners. Garwood is considered by the Department of Defense to have acted as a collaborator with the enemy after he was taken prisoner, while it is claimed by proponents of the "live prisoners" belief, and by Garwood himself, that he was an American POW abandoned by the military.
POW/MIA activist organizations.
The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia was created by Sybil Stockdale, Evelyn Grubb and Mary Crowe as an originally small group of POW/MIA wives in Coronado, California and Hampton Roads Virginia in 1967. Sybil Stockdale's husband, Navy Commander James Stockdale, was shot down in 1965 and she was determined to make the American people aware of the mistreatment of U.S. POWs. This publicity resulted in better treatment of U.S. POWs from fall 1969 on.
After the war, the National League of Families became the leading group requesting information about those still listed as missing in action. It was led by Ann Mills Griffiths. Its stated mission was and is "to obtain the release of all prisoners, the fullest possible accounting for the missing and repatriation of all recoverable remains of those who died serving our nation during the Vietnam War in Southeast Asia." The League's most prominent symbol is its POW/MIA flag. This group was more established, less radical, and more connected to the government. 
The National Alliance of Families For the Return of America's Missing Servicemen was founded in 1990. Its goal was and is to resolve the fates of any unreturned U.S. prisoners of war or missing in action from World War II on forward, not just Southeast Asia, and to gain the return of any live prisoners. It is a 1980s-origined splinter from the National League of Families, created by members who were dissatisfied with Ann Mills Griffiths' leadership. Compared to the older group, the National Alliance took a more activist, radical stance, especially towards belief in the existence of live prisoners in Southeast Asia.
The chair and co-founder of the group is Dolores Apodata Alfond, whose brother was shot down in 1967 during the Vietnam War. The group was visible during the Kerry Committee hearings of the early 1990s, but disagreed with the committee's findings that there was no compelling evidence of any live prisoners in Southeast Asia.
Businessman and POW/MIA advocate Ross Perot, who had done much to help POW families during the war, was also very active on this issue.
Recovery and "rescue".
In the mid-1980s, the U.S. and Vietnam increased the frequency of high-level policy and technical meetings to help resolve the POW/MIA issue. The U.S. government viewed this work as a humanitarian obligation. The Vietnamese slowly began to return American remains that they had previously collected and stored; eventually they permitted the U.S. to excavate a few crash sites. The Lao government, with whom the USG maintained diplomatic relations, also agreed to several crash-site excavations in the mid-1980s. This resulted in the return and identification of the remains of a few dozen Americans. In Cambodia, political turmoil prevented such efforts.
A number of individuals were not satisfied with or did not trust U.S. government actions in this area and took their own initiative. Retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Jack Bailey created Operation Rescue, which featured a former smuggling boat named "Akuna III" and solicited funds from POW/MIA groups. Bailey never produced any prisoners and the boat spent years never leaving its dock in Songkhla in Thailand, but the effort proved adept at bringing in money through the Virginia-based Eberle Associates direct mail marketing firm. It was later revealed that Bailey had greatly exaggerated his military record.
During the 1980s, former United States Army Special Forces member Bo Gritz undertook a series of private trips into Southeast Asia, purportedly to locate American POWs which some believed were still being held by Laos and Vietnam, for example at location Nhommarath. These missions were heavily publicized, controversial and widely decried as haphazard — for instance, as some commentators stated, few successful secret missions involve bringing to the border towns women openly marketing commemorative POW-rescue T-shirts.
One such mission in 1982 was to free POWs reported to be in Laos; Gritz led 15 Laotians and 3 Americans, but they were ambushed shortly after crossing the border from Vietnam to Laos and the mission failed. CSM Eric L. Haney, a former Delta Force operator, claims that the unit was twice told to prepare for a mission involving the rescue of American POWs from Vietnam, but both times the missions were scrubbed, according to Haney, when Gritz suddenly appeared in the spotlight, drawing too much attention to the issue and making the missions too difficult to accomplish. The U.S. National Security Council would eventually say of him: "Throughout his years of involvement, Mr. Gritz contributed nothing of value to the POW/MIA issue. In fact, his activities have been counter-productive."
Another figure of the 1980s was Scott Barnes, who claimed he had both been in a secret operation in Cambodia and had seen an American POW. His actions caused significant dissension among POW/MIA activists, especially once he claimed that he had seen more American POWs in Laos but had been ordered by the CIA to assassinate them. The National League of Families ended up accusing him of exploiting the MIA issue for personal gain, as one wife had mortgaged her house to fund him. Barnes, who had concocted much of his purported military background, would subsequently become a controversial figure within Ross Perot's 1992 presidential campaign.
A former American POW, Eugene "Red" McDaniel, also became convinced that American prisoners had been left behind, and became active in the issue during the 1980s and early 1990s.
Effect on popular culture.
In the words of one analysis, "The notion that the United States may have left men behind was hard to fathom, and Americans chose to partly solve this complex problem through fictional characters." 
This was especially true in American films. The first was Chuck Norris's 1978 "Good Guys Wear Black", which postulated a cynical U.S. government writing off MIAs with a bogus mission. 1983's "Uncommon Valor", starring Gene Hackman, followed suit, as did Norris again in 1984 with "Missing in Action".
By far the most visible film in this theme was Sylvester Stallone's "" in 1985, which did the most to popularize the idea that American POWs had been left behind after the war and that the government had no real interest in their rescue. The Rambo character, who in this film may have been partly modeled after Bo Gritz, was a Vietnam veteran commando still haunted by the multiple failures of the war. The pivotal moment of the film occurs when Rambo, realizing he was betrayed by the U.S. government and under torture from the Vietnamese and their Soviet allies, is put into radio communication with the officer who ordered the mission and tells him, "Murdoch. I'm coming to get "you"!" Rambo and the Norris films were commercially successful in both the United States and in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia, and did much to perpetuate the stock image of American prisoners held in bamboo cages.
"Rambo" was followed by Norris's 1985 prequel "", as well as other films such as "P.O.W. The Escape" (1986) and "Dog Tags" (1990) that shared similar conceits. The Vietnam war POW/MIA issue was explored in some U.S. television series, such as the 1997 "The X-Files" episode "Unrequited".
The "live prisoners" debate.
Several committee investigations within the U.S. Congress took place over the years. Some members of Congress were quite active on the issue.
For Vietnam veteran Bob Smith, Representative and later Senator from New Hampshire, the fate of possible missing or captured Americans in Vietnam had been Smith's major issue since his arrival in Congress in 1985. His interest was partly motivated by his own experience growing up without knowing how his own father died in World War II.
North Carolina Congressman Bill Hendon, who served two terms in the early-mid-1980s, was also quite active on the issue. He and Smith met with President Ronald Reagan in January 1986 to discuss their belief that Vietnam was still holding American prisoners, and that U.S. intelligence agencies knew this but that the bureaucracy within the agencies was covering it up from even the Secretary of Defense. Reagan termed Hendon "way out yonder" on the issue, and after Vice President George H. W. Bush reported that even Smith would not agree with Hendon on some of these claims, Reagan concluded that "Bill is off his rocker".
New York Congressman John LeBoutillier, who served one term in the early 1980s, became interested in politics due to POW matters. After leaving Congress, he continued to be active in POW/MIA affairs. He founded the Sky Hook II Project, dedicated to recovering living American POWs in Southeast Asia. He has made frequent trips to Laos and Vietnam and also met with Laotian and Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Vientiane, and western cities. 
Another political figure active in the POW/MIA issue was Tom Walsh, who became mayor of Casper, Wyoming, and a three-term member of the Wyoming House of Representatives. Walsh made fourteen trips, at his own expense, to search for information on POWs and MIAs.
The POW/MIA issue heated up in the early 1990s. Serious charges were leveled at the Bush administration (1989 to 1993) regarding the POW/MIA issue. The United States Department of Defense, headed by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, was accused of covering up information and failing to properly pursue intelligence about American POW/MIAs.
Ranking minority member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, became interested in the matter. In October 1990 his chief staff aide, James P. Lucier, prepared a report stating that it was probable there were live POWs still being held and that the Bush administration was complicit in hiding the facts. The report also alleged that the Soviet Union had held American prisoners after the end of World War II and more may have been transferred there during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Helms stated that the "deeper story" was a possible "deliberate effort by certain people in the government to disregard all information or reports about living MIA-POWs." This allegation was followed in May 1991 by Helms' release of a minority report of the Foreign Relations Committee, entitled "An Examination of US Policy Toward POW/MIAs", which made similar claims and concluded that "any evidence that suggested an MIA might be alive was uniformly and arbitrarily rejected..." The issuance of the report angered other Republicans on the committee, and after charges were made that the report contained errors, innuendo, and unsubstantiated rumors, Helms distanced himself from the POW/MIA issue. (This and other personnel matters led to Helms firing Lucier in January 1992.)
A July 1991 "Newsweek" cover photograph purported to show three American POWs still being held against their will, which increased general public interest in the issue. However, the photograph would turn out to be a hoax. Polls showed that a majority of Americans believed live POWs were indeed still being held captive; a July 1991 "Wall Street Journal" poll showed 70 percent of Americans believing this, and that three-fourths of them believed the U.S. government was not doing what needed to be done to gain their release.
Interest in the matter intensified in June 1992 when President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin told NBC News in an interview that some Americans captured during the Vietnam War may have been transferred from Hanoi to the Soviet Union: "Our archives have shown that it is true, some of them were transferred to the territory of the former U.S.S.R. and were kept in labor camps. We don't have complete data and can only surmise that some of them may still be alive."
Ross Perot stated that he believed that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia at the end of the U.S. involvement in the war, and that government officials were covering up POW/MIA investigations in order to not reveal a drug smuggling operation used to finance a secret war in Laos.
Retired United States Army General, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and current head of the American POW/MIA delegation in Hanoi, John Vessey, defended administrations' and the military's role in trying to get the Vietnamese to improve their efforts in ascertaining the fate of missing U.S. personnel. Vessey had succeeded in 1988 in convincing the Vietnamese to permit U.S. search teams to operate throughout the country. Vessey categorically rejected the notion of a government conspiracy, saying that he had never seen evidence of one at any time in his military career, and adding that, "American soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are not conspirators." United States Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said that Vietnamese cooperation was improved but still needed much more improvement.
For critics and skeptics, the allegations fail to convincingly answer the question as to what reason the Vietnamese (and other neighboring countries) would have to hang on to living prisoners. They could have been returned post-war, or being inconvenient witnesses to abuse more easily simply murdered. Proponents of the theory often claimed that the prisoners were initially held back as part of a scheme to gain war reparations from the U.S., and then were continued to be held so that the Vietnamese would not have to admit to what they had done.
Kerry committee.
Senator Bob Smith introduced a 1991 resolution to create a Senate Select POW/MIA Committee. Senator and fellow Vietnam War veteran John Kerry was the chair of the committee, and its third key member was Senator and former Vietnam War POW John McCain. Compared to earlier congressional investigations into the POW/MIA issue, this one had a mandate to be more skeptical and ask harder questions of government officials than before. The committee's work included more visits to Vietnam and getting the Department of Defense to declassify over a million pages of relevant documents. Kerry and McCain said that they had gotten the Vietnamese to give them full access to their records, and that they had spent thousands of hours trying to find real, not fabricated, evidence of surviving Americans.
Some of the most publicized testimony before the committee came in September 1992, when former Nixon Defense Secretaries Melvin Laird and James Schlesinger said that the U.S. government had believed in 1973 that some American servicemen had not been returned from Laos, despite Nixon's public statements to the contrary. Schlesinger said, "As of now, I can come to no other conclusion. that does not mean there are any alive today." Laird said in retrospect of Nixon's assurances that all POWs were coming home, "I think it was unfortunate to be that positive. You can't be that positive when we had the kind of intelligence we had." In reaction to the testimony, Kerry said, "I think it's quite extraordinary when two former secretaries of defense both give evidence documenting that they had information, or they believed personally, that people were alive and not accounted for in Operation Homecoming."
The committee issued its unanimous findings on January 13, 1993. In response to the central question of whether any American POWs were still in captivity, it stated:
With specific regard to the "some evidence", the committee said this: "But neither live-sighting reports nor other sources of intelligence have provided grounds for encouragement, particularly over the past decade. The live-sighting reports that have been resolved have not checked out; alleged pictures of POWs have proven false; purported leads have come up empty; and photographic intelligence has been inconclusive, at best." Two senators, Smith and Grassley, dissented at note 12, with the report saying "they believe that live-sighting reports and other sources of intelligence are evidence that POWs may have survived to the present."
With regard to the possibility that American POWs survived in Southeast Asia after Operation Homecoming, the committee said this: "We acknowledge that there is no proof that U.S. POWs survived, but neither is there proof that all of those who did not return had died. There is evidence, moreover, that indicates the possibility of survival, at least for a small number, after Operation Homecoming."
Committee vice-chairman Smith seemed to back away from the committee's findings within months of their being issued, appearing in April 1993 on "Larry King Live" with POW/MIA activist Bill Hendon, stressing his partial dissent from the majority report and touting new evidence of North Vietnam having held back prisoners in 1973, and then in the Senate in September 1993, saying he had "very compelling" new evidence of live prisoners. He also asked the Justice Department to investigate ten federal officials for perjury and other crimes in conjunction with a cover-up of POW/MIA investigations, In what he dubbed "Operation Clean Sweep", Smith said the targeted officials had a "mind-set to debunk". Kerry and McCain both denounced Smith's actions, with McCain saying "In my dealings with these people, it is clear that mistakes may have been made in a very complex set of issues. But at no time was there any indication that they were giving anything but their most dedicated efforts. I frankly don't feel it's appropriate to publicly make these charges without public substantiation." Defense Secretary Les Aspin said the charges were unwarranted.
In 1994, journalist Sydney Schanberg, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in the 1970s for his "New York Times" reporting in Cambodia, wrote a long article for "Penthouse" magazine in which he said the committee had been dominated by a faction led by Kerry that "wanted to appear to be probing the prisoner issue energetically, but in fact, they never rocked official Washington's boat, nor did they lay open the 20 years of secrecy and untruths." Schanberg stated that key committee staff had had too close a relationship with the Department of Defense, and that while other committee investigators were able to get evidence of men left behind into the full body of the report, the report's conclusions "were watered down and muddied to the point of meaninglessness." Kerry denied that the committee had engaged in any cover-up.
The Kerry committee did little to soften the attitudes of those directly involved in the issue. To skeptics, "live prisoners" remained a conspiracy theory unsupported by motivation or evidence, and the foundation for a cottage industry of charlatans who preyed upon the hopes of the families of the missing. As two skeptics wrote in 1995, "The conspiracy myth surrounding the Americans who remained missing after Operation Homecoming in 1973 had evolved to baroque intricacy. By 1992, there were thousands of zealots—who believed with cultlike fervor that hundreds of American POWs had been deliberately and callously abandoned in Indochina after the war, that there was a vast conspiracy within the armed forces and the executive branch—spanning five administrations—to cover up all evidence of this betrayal, and that the governments of Communist Vietnam and Laos continued to hold an unspecified number of living American POWs, despite their adamant denials of this charge." Believers continued to strongly reject such notions; as one wrote in 1994, "It is not conspiracy theory, not paranoid myth, not Rambo fantasy. It is only hard evidence of a national disgrace: American prisoners were left behind at the end of the Vietnam War. They were abandoned because six presidents and official Washington could not admit their guilty secret. They were forgotten because the press and most Americans turned away from all things that reminded them of Vietnam."
Normalization with Vietnam.
The actions of the committee were designed to allow for improved ties between the U.S. and Vietnam, for which the unresolved fate of American MIAs had long been a sticking point. The belief by Americans from a few years earlier that live prisoners still existed had mostly passed; in the words of "Time" magazine, "most people seemed resigned to the idea that the fortunes of war are bound to leave a few mysteries." In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Kerry and McCain, that called for an end to the existing trade embargo against Vietnam; it was intended to pave the way for normalization.
When President Bill Clinton lifted the trade embargo on February 3, 1994, he stated:
In response, columnist Dan Rather wrote the following:
In 1995, President Bill Clinton normalized diplomatic relations with the country of Vietnam, with McCain's and Kerry's visible support during the announcement giving Clinton, who came of age during Vietnam but did not serve in the military, some political cover. 
During his time on the committee and afterward, McCain was vilified as a fraud, traitor, or "Manchurian Candidate" by many of the POW/MIA activists who believed in live prisoners. McCain's high profile on the Vietnam issue also cost him the friendship of some fellow former POWs; In return, McCain continued to attack those he saw as profiteers exploiting the families of those missing in action.
In the 1990s, the Joint Task Force–Full Accounting in conjunction with the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command was established to focus on achieving the fullest possible accounting of Americans missing from the Vietnam War. It has interviewed thousands of witnesses regarding the fate of missing Americans, and conducts ten missions per year in Southeast Asia to search for remains of those still listed as missing.
In the 2000s.
Schanberg would return to the POW/MIA subject during John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign in a series of articles for "The Village Voice"; he claimed that Kerry had shredded documents, suppressed testimony, and sanitized findings during his time as chairman of the committee. Kerry denied these allegations and responded overall by saying, "In the end, I think what we can take pride in is that we put together the most significant, most thorough, most exhaustive accounting for missing and former POWs in the history of human warfare."
In 2007, the former Congressman Bill Hendon published his book "An Enormous Crime", which chronicled his view of the history of American soldiers abandoned in Southeast Asia following the war and the circumstances that left them there. A companion website allows readers to examine actual intelligence reports and decide if the Defense Intelligence Agency acted properly in dismissing each case. The book ranked to #34 on the New York Times Best Seller list.
A year later, Schanberg would again publish articles, this time for "The Nation" and The Nation Institute, during John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, in which he recapped his previous arguments and additionally claimed that McCain had helped cover up the long suppression of evidence concerning live prisoners. Former Congressman LeBoutillier was also vocal in his opposition to McCain, in part due to McCain's failure to acknowledge what he saw as evidence of live American POWs left behind. However, while the group of activists on the topic still felt very strongly about it, the matter had largely faded from the American public, and McCain's actions with regard to the POW/MIA issue never were a factor in his eventually losing campaign. 
By the late 2000s, the remains of over 700 Americans killed in Southeast Asia had been returned and identified. The controversy continued to pop up on occasion in the following decade, with the 2013 Canadian documentary "Unclaimed" telling the story of an elderly man in Vietnam claiming to be a U.S. soldier thought killed in action in 1968. However, Defense Department officials said the man was an imposter with a history of impersonating American POWs.
Efforts continued to recover nearly 1,800 Americans who remained unaccounted for. Working jointly, American and Vietnamese experts focus on "Last Known Alive" cases, which involve missing Americans whom the U.S. believed might have survived their initial loss incident. Outcomes of these investigations helps resolve the live prisoners question. The U.S. has identified 296 individuals as Last Known Alive cases in all of Southeast Asia, and following full investigations, the Defense Department has determined that more than 190 are deceased.

List of Hellraiser characters

Hellraiser is a British horror franchise that consists of nine films, a series of comic books, as well as merchandise based on the series. The franchise is based on the novella "The Hellbound Heart" by Clive Barker, who would go on to write and direct the adaptation of his story, titled "Hellraiser". The films, as well as the comic book series, continually features the Cenobite Pinhead. The series’ storyline focuses on a puzzle box that opens a gateway to another dimension, where the Cenobites come forth to take whoever opened the box back to their world, delivering an eternity of torture and experimentation. As well as the Cenobites other recurring characters include heroine Kirsty Cotton and several others.
A.
Amy Klein.
Amy Klein is a character in the film "", where she is portrayed by Kari Wührer as an adult and Maria Pintea as a young girl. A gonzo-style reporter, Amy was physically (and possibly sexually) abused by her father as a child, which led her to stab him to death. After viewing a videotape her boss Charles received in the mail which depicts a member of a cult known as the Deaders committing suicide and subsequently being resurrected by Deaders leader Winter, Amy travels from London to Bucharest to look into the Deaders. Finding another tape and the Lament Configuration puzzle box in the apartment of a heavily decayed-looking Deader named Marla, who subsequently appears to her several times, Amy tinkers with the box, causing her to have a brief encounter with the Cenobite Pinhead. Tracking down Winter and the Deader's home, Amy is forced into experiencing something of a vision quest by Winter, who wishes to use her to solve the Lament Configuration, something neither he nor his followers can do. Eventually snapping out of her trance-like state, Amy is almost goaded into killing herself (so she can be resurrected later) with a knife by Winter, but relents and inadvertently solves the Lament Configuration by hurling it at a wall. Summoning Pinhead and the Cenobites, Amy witnesses them rip Winter (revealed to be a descendent of box creator Phillip Lemarchand) apart with hooked chains and subsequently kill the Deaders once and for all. When the Cenobites turn their attention on her, Amy, to rob them of collecting her soul, commits suicide by stabbing herself, causing the Lament Configuration to make the Cenobites vanish and cause the Deader's lair to collapse.

After rejoining Jake, Chelsea is confronted by the party host, who she had discovered was Adam's father. After the host causes Jake to become trapped in a coffin, he begins burying Chelsea alive, revealing he had drugged her and her friends and buried them, using cell phones to send messages to them and cause them to hallucinate everything, all in an attempt to avenge the death of Adam. Before the host can finish burying her, Chelsea returns to consciousness and is dug up by the police along with Jake. The police reveal to Chelsea that she and Jake have been buried for days and that they were only found due to anonymous call from Leviathan House, which Chelsea believes was made by Adam's spirit, which she briefly spots gazing out a window of Leviathan House.

Derelict, The Puzzle Guardian.
Derelict, The Puzzle Guardian is a character in the film "Hellraiser" where it is portrayed by Frank Baker. A filthy-looking vagrant, the Puzzle Guardian acts as the protector of the Lament Configuration puzzle box, passing it from hand to hand and saving it from danger. The Puzzle Guardian first appears in Morocco, where it sells Frank Cotton the Lament Configuration. Later, the Puzzle Guardian, having traveled to England, begins stalking Kirsty Cotton, at one point going into the pet shop where the young woman works and eating a large amount of crickets before being shooed away.

Later, after Kirsty banishes the Cenobites back to Hell and attempts to escape her rapidly decaying house, the Engineer appears again. Grappling with Kirsty and her boyfriend Steve as they attempt to reclaim the Lament Configuration, the Engineer is banished back to Hell when Kirsty manages to grab the puzzle box and solves it.
The Engineer was to appear in "", but was removed completely. However, the character can still be briefly seen through an editing error at the end of Hellbound, as Kirsty and Tiffany flee the Labyrinth racing for the closing gate as souls flee all around them. Only the Engineer, and the souls fleeing, are visible in the orphaned shot (interlaced with shots of Kirsty and Tiffany fleeing), which takes place just as Leviathan begins to transform into a puzzle box. The orphaned shot remains in the stand alone DVD released in Region 1.
In "", another being called the Engineer appears, a faceless and near-mythic criminal played by Ray Miceli. When a detective named Joseph Thorne begins hunting for it and the child it has presumably kidnapped, the Engineer continually taunts the detective, systematically killing the man's friends and loved ones while leaving a child's finger at all the crime scenes. When it is revealed to Joseph by Pinhead that the detective has been in Hell ever since he solved the Lament Configuration, Pinhead also reveals that the Engineer is Joseph's "flesh", the embodiment of his carnal desires which have doomed his soul to repeat the same sequence of events for all eternity.
The Engineer is referenced to in "" as an enemy in the online computer game "Hellworld"; later in the film, when the characters begin to question whether they are actually in Hell, one of them sarcastically asks "Where are the Engineers?"
The version of the Engineer from the first "Hellraiser" film made only one appearance in the Epic comic series, in the seventh issue of the "Clive Barker's Hellraiser" anthology series.

After his three mistresses and best friend, who had mentioned a plot to kill Kirsty and take her inheritance, wind up dead, Trevor is arrested when he is found with one of the bodies. Taken to the morgue in the bowels of the police department, Trevor is confronted by Pinhead, who restores Trevor's memories; Trevor had bought the Lament Configuration and planned to use it to kill Kirsty, though his plan backfired when Kirsty made a deal with Pinhead, offering five souls in exchange for her own. Trevor's mistresses and friend were the first four souls, with Trevor himself being the fifth, Kirsty having shot him in the head and sent him to his own personal Hell.

History.
The hospital was originally named the "Palm Bay Community Hospital." In 2008, they removed the "Community" from its name.
In April 2007, Health First broke ground on a $83.5 million expansion project. The expansion will more than double the size of the hospital addressing the hospital's robust utilization and the future growth needs of Palm Bay and its surrounding community.
Health First invested $76.5 million into upgrades from 2007 to 2009.
In 2011, it had 89.4% of its admissions through the emergency room, more than any other hospital in Brevard and above the state average of 61.6%. Some of this difference can be explained by procedural differences in how hospitals admit patients.

Brushing and linking

In databases, brushing and linking refers to the connection of two or more views of the same data, such that a change to the representation in one view affects the representation in the other. Brushing and linking is also an important technique in interactive visual analysis, a methodology for performing visual exploration and analysis of large, structured data sets. 
Specifically, brushing refers to a change of parameters (for example a data filter) in one data representation being reflected in other connected data representations. Linking refers to highlighting, for example selected data, in one view, in other connected data presentations.
One example might be a two-part display, consisting of a histogram alongside a list of document titles. The histogram could show how many documents were published each month. Brushing and linking would allow the user to assign a color, green for instance, to one bar of the histogram, thus causing the titles in the list display that were published during the corresponding month to also be highlighted in green.

Worksman Cycles is an American manufacturer of bicycles and tricycles for industrial, commercial and recreational use. The company was founded in 1898 and is located in Ozone Park in the borough of Queens in New York City. They claim to be the oldest bicycle manufacturer in the USA.
Worksman was started by Morris Worksman, who started out by building cycles for local deliveries in New York City. Later, he built tricycles for the Good Humor Ice Cream Company with an ice cream cooler on the front. Worksman still builds cycles and carts for various types of food vendors.
The company is best known today for building cycles for industrial uses that enable workers to travel inside large industrial plants and warehouses, with some models allowing significant cargo weight. The company has expanded into making tricycles and bicycles for consumers. However, these too are in the specialty category. For example, recently Worksman Cycles introduced several adult tricycles that are suitable for the special needs market, including a two seat side by side trike and a low rider semi-recumbent tricycle. Worksman Heavy Duty Bicycles are also popular for consumers looking for classic Retro styled heavy duty bicycles.
Worksman also has a division 800Buy-cart that manufactures stainless steel food vending pushcarts, such as the ubiquitous New York City hot dog cart.
With few bicycles manufactured in the USA after the 20th century, Worksman Cycles is a unique company in that it still welds, paints and assembles bicycles and Adult tricycles in New York City. 
Worksman also owns the Atlantic Coast Cruiser brand which imports traditional Cruiser bicycles from China.

Irwin Gunsalus

Irwin C. "Gunny" Gunsalus (June 29, 1912 – October 25, 2008) was an American biochemist who discovered lipoic acid, a vitamin-like substance (an enzyme cofactor) that has been used as a treatment for chronic liver disease, and pyridoxal phosphate, one of the active forms of vitamin B6. In his role as assistant secretary general at the United Nations, he led the international body's research on genetic engineering.
Early life.
Gunsalus was born June 29, 1912 in Sully County, South Dakota, at the homestead of his family farm. His father was killed in a threshing machine accident before Gunsalus started college. He attended South Dakota State University before transferring to Cornell University, where he studied bacteriology, earning a bachelor's degree in 1933, a master's in 1937 and was awarded a doctoral degree in the field in 1940.
Academic career.
Gunsalus taught bacteriology from 1940 to 1947 at Cornell University. There he studied issues of food safety and disease risk. From 1947 to 1950, he was a professor of bacteriology at Indiana University. Gunsalus was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1949 for his work on intermediary metabolism of microorganisms.
In 1950, he took a faculty position as professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, shifting his speciality in 1955 to head the biochemistry department until 1966. While there, he co-authored "The Bacteria: A Treatise on Structure and Function" with Roger Y. Stanier, a five-volume work that served as a basic textbook for scientists entering the field.
In the 1950s, while studying Enterococcus, a lactic acid bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract, Gunsalus discovered various forms of lipoic acid, as well as pyridoxal phosphate, an active form of vitamin B6, and was granted a patent in 1962 on lipoic acid. In further research, he discovered the role that lipoic acid plays in metabolism, allowing for the more effective use of carbohydrates in the diet. By the 1970s, other researchers and hospitals had begun to use lipoic acid for the treatment of chronic liver disease. It has since been used experimentally to treat pancreatic cancer and its use as a dietary supplement to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease has been proposed.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Gunsalus studied Cytochrome P450, researching its role in metabolism in the human liver. His studies led to an understanding of how the family of P-450 proteins and their role in metabolizing natural and man-made compounds.
He also researched the way that soil microbes exchange plasmids, giving the organisms the ability to adapt to differing nutritional substances available in their environment. Gunsalus was a postdoctoral advisor to Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty, who later used genetic engineering techniques for plasmid transfer to create microbes that could digest petroleum.
In February 1967, Gunsalus was one of four scientists who delivered to President Lyndon B. Johnson a petition that had been signed by more than 5,000 scientists demanding an end to the use of biological and chemical weapons in Vietnam. The petition included 17 Nobel Prize-winners and 127 members of the National Academy of Sciences.
Post-academic career.
After retiring from the University of Illinois in 1982, Gunsalus was named the founding director of the United Nations International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, which is responsible for increasing international cooperation in the development and use of genetic engineering and biotechnology in issues related to development. He oversaw the establishment of research centers in Trieste, Italy and in New Delhi, India. He was later chosen to conduct ecological studies of the Gulf of Mexico for the United States Environmental Protection Agency from 1993 to 2003, where he studied methods for microbiological bioremediation of coastal ecosystems.
Gunsalus was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Microbiology. He was also elected to the National Academy of Sciences, where he served as the chairman of the biochemistry section from 1978 to 1981. He was the founding editor of the journal "Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications". In 1982 he was the recipient of the Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology from the National Academy of Sciences.
Gunsalus died at age 96 on October 25, 2008 at his home in Andalusia, Alabama of congestive heart failure.

At the 2012 Brier, he became the first skip from Canada's north to make the playoffs at the Brier since the addition of the playoffs in 1980. 
He is the younger brother of Alberta curler Kevin Koe and twin brother of Territories champion Kerry Galusha.
Career.
Junior career.
Koe played in five straight Canadian Junior Curling Championships, from 1994 to 1998. In 1994, he played third for his brother, Kevin, representing the Yukon/Northwest Territories team. The rink lost in the final to Alberta. In 1995, Kevin graduated from juniors, leaving Jamie to skip the team. He would skip the Territories to a 2-9 record at the 1995 Juniors. In 1996, each territory got their own team, and Koe would skip the Northwest Territories team. The rink finished the round robin with a 7-5 record, and would win won and lose one tie breaker match. In 1997, Koe's Northwest Territories team finished the round robin in 2nd place at 8-4, but lost to Ontario's John Morris in the semi-final. In his final juniors, in 1998, Koe missed the playoffs, skipping the Northwest Territories to a 5-7 record.
Men's career.
After juniors, Koe moved to Alberta for school, and would team up with his brother again. However, he would soon move back to his native Northwest Territories. 
Koe won his first Territories men's championship in 2006, sending him to his first Tim Hortons Brier. His 6-5 record at the 2006 Tim Hortons Brier was good enough for 5th place, the best finish for the Territories since 1975. Koe would represent the Territories again in 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Koe got to play his brother for the first time at a Brier in 2010, when Kevin won the Alberta provincial championship for the first time. It was only the third time in Brier history where two brothers would compete against each other as skips.
Koe's best performance at the Brier was at the 2012 Tim Hortons Brier, where he finished 7-4 in the round robin, securing the 4th place spot in the playoffs. However, he lost both his playoff matches, settling for fourth place. He lost to his brother Kevin's Alberta rink in the 3 vs. 4 game, and then lost to Manitoba's Rob Fowler in an extra end in the bronze medal game. Koe returned to the Brier in 2013 where he could not repeat his success, but still posted a decent 5-6 record.

2009 Rose Bowl

The 2009 Rose Bowl, the 95th edition of the annual game, was a college football bowl game played on Thursday, January 1, 2009 at the same-named stadium in Pasadena, California. Because of sponsorship by Citi, the first game in the 2009 edition of the Bowl Championship Series was officially titled the ""Rose Bowl Game presented by citi"". The contest was televised on ABC with a radio broadcast on ESPN Radio beginning at 4:30 PM US EST with kickoff at 5:10 PM. Ticket prices for all seats in the Rose Bowl were listed at $145. The Rose Bowl Game was a contractual sell-out, with 64,500 tickets allocated to the participating teams and conferences. The remaining tickets went to the Tournament of Roses members, sponsors, City of Pasadena residents, and the general public.
Scoring 24 unanswered points in the second quarter, the Pacific-10 Conference Champion University of Southern California Trojans defeated the Big Ten Conference co-champion, the Pennsylvania State University Nittany Lions, 38-24, for their third consecutive Rose Bowl victory (in their fourth consecutive appearance, having lost the 2006 BCS title game to the Texas Longhorns). The victory gave the Trojans their 24th Rose Bowl championship, the most by any team in the country. Quarterback Mark Sanchez scored five touchdowns, one rushing and four passing.
Prior to the game, the Pac-10 conference had a 4-0 record in bowl games this season with wins by Arizona, Cal, Oregon, and Oregon State. The Trojan win gave the Pac-10 a perfect five out of five games, which was the only perfect conference bowl record of the season. The Big Ten conference had last won a Rose Bowl game in the 1999 season; this streak ended when Ohio State beat Oregon in the 2010 Rose Bowl.
Teams.
The teams participating in the Rose Bowl Game were announced on Sunday, December 7, by the Pasadena Tournament of Roses football committee. Big Ten co-champions, Penn State, coached by Joe Paterno, were picked to play against Southern California, the champions of the Pac-10, coached by Pete Carroll. Penn State earned its bid via a head-to-head tiebreaker, beating Ohio State, 13–6 in Columbus, Ohio, on October 25, 2008. The Men of Troy earned their way in by defeating UCLA 28-7 on December 6, 2008. USC was designated as the home team, wearing dark jerseys and using the east bench on game day.
The 2009 game marked the first time since that the traditional teams—the champions of the Big Ten and the Pac-10—squared off at the Rose Bowl, because at least one league champion played in the BCS Championship in each the previous four years. In , Big Ten champion Michigan met Texas, as USC played Oklahoma in the designated BCS Championship Game game that year, the Orange Bowl. The following year, USC met Texas in the game, which was designated as that year's BCS National Championship contest; Big Ten champion Penn State played in the Orange Bowl against Florida State. In and , the runners-up of the Big Ten were sent to this game, since the champion, Ohio State, participated in the newly established separate BCS Championship Game: the Wolverines played in 2007 and Illinois would do so the following year; both teams played (and lost to) the Trojans.
Both teams lost one game during the 2008 regular season. Penn State was defeated by Iowa (24-23) and Southern California lost to Oregon State (27-21). USC and Penn State had faced two common opponents in the regular season. Both teams defeated Ohio State and Penn State beat Oregon State prior to the Beavers' defeat of the Trojans.
Penn State had appeared in the Rose Bowl twice before, losing to the Trojans 14-3 in in their only previous meeting in "The Granddaddy Of Them All", and winning in over 1994 Pac-10 champion Oregon 38-20, the latter game capped an unbeaten season in which Penn State finished #2 in both major polls. The Trojans have played in the Rose Bowl more times than any other team and made its fourth consecutive appearance in 2009. The two teams have faced each other eight times, with each team winning four games. The Kickoff Classic XVIII on August 27, 2000, in Giants Stadium at East Rutherford, New Jersey, was the last time they met: the Trojans defeated the Nittany Lions, 29-5.

<doc id="20349577" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20349577" title="The Sea of Ice">
The Sea of Ice

The Sea of Ice (), also called The Wreck of Hope () is an oil painting of 1823–1824 by the German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich.
Description.
The landscape depicts a shipwreck in the middle of a broken ice-sheet, whose shards have piled up after the impact. The ice has become like a monolithic tomb, or dolmen, whose edges jut into the sky.
The stern of the wreck is just visible on the right. As an inscription on it confirms, this is HMS "Griper", one of two ships that took part in William Edward Parry's 1819–1820 and 1824 expeditions to the North Pole.
Title.
The two titles originally referred to the present work and another older work by Friedrich, now missing. The lost painting was shown in 1822 at the Dresden Academy exhibition under the title "A Wrecked Ship off the Coast of Greenland in the Moonlight. Own Invention". The present painting was first shown in 1824 at the Prague Academy exhibition under the title "An Idealized Scene of an Arctic Sea, with a Wrecked Ship on the Heaped Masses of Ice".
In Friedrich's estate this work was described as "Ice Picture. The Disaster-stricken North Pole Expedition".
History.
The collector Johann Gottlob von Quandt commissioned two pictures that were to symbolize the south and the north. Johann Martin von Rohden received the commission to paint "Southern Nature in her Abundant and Majestic Splendor", while the commission for "Northern Nature in the whole of her Terrifying Beauty" fell to Friedrich. However, as Schukowski in a letter dated 1821 reported, Friedrich -
Accounts of expeditions to the North Pole were occasionally published during those years which is likely how Friedrich became familiar with William Edward Parry's 1819–1820 expedition to find the Northwest Passage. In the winter of 1820–21, Friedrich made extensive oil studies of ice floes on the river Elbe, near Dresden. These were probably incorporated into "The Sea of Ice".
Reception and influence.
The image created a lasting impression on the French sculptor David d'Angers during his visit to Dresden in 1834, which he described as follows:
Overall, however, the work was seen as too radical in composition, and went unsold until after Friedrich's death in 1840.
From the twentieth century the work has proved extremely influential upon the arctic landscapes of Lawren Harris, and directly influenced Paul Nash's painting "Totes Meer". The painting has been hailed by critic Russell Potter as a key instance of the "Arctic Sublime," and an influence on later nineteenth-century polar paintings by Frederic Edwin Church and William Bradford.
The painting is also reproduced on the cover of the Norton Critical Edition (2nd ed.) of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), and may owe its title to this text:
Architect Thom Mayne references The Sea of Ice as a primary influence as to how he approaches the dynamic relationship between architecture, landscape, and nature.
The painting appears on the cover of the album Return to the Sea (2006) by indie rock band Islands.

Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda

Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda (born on July 9, 1960) is a Democratic member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 9th District, which includes most of Leon County, since 2008.
History.
Rehwinkel Vasilinda was born in Rochester, New York and moved to Florida in 1977 to attend New College, where she studied from 1977 to 1982, before graduating from the University of South Florida in 1982 with a degree in social and behavioral studies. Following this, she attended the University of Florida College of Law, graduating with her Juris Doctor in 1985.
Florida House of Representatives.
In 2008, when incumbent State Representative Loranne Ausley could not seek another term due to term limits, Rehwinkel Vasilinda ran to succeed her in the 9th District, which included parts of Gadsden County, Jefferson County, and Leon County. She won the Democratic primary unopposed, and faced Peter Boulware, the Republican nominee and a former football player for the Florida State Seminoles and the Baltimore Ravens. Despite the district's Democratic lean, Boulware was competitive with Rehwinkel Vasilinda, and managed to significantly outraise her. In the end, she emerged narrowly victorious, winning by 430 votes and with 49% of the vote.
She was challenged in the Democratic primary in 2010 by Rick Minor, the former Chairman of the Leon County Democratic Party. Minor attacked her for voting in favor of offshore oil drilling, a vote that she contended was part of "a much larger energy package," declaring that she "never promoted, supported or defended offshore drilling." She was also attacked for being "a liability," as in 2008, she "barely won in a district that Barack Obama took by 24 points." Despite these spirited attacks, however, Rehwinkel Vasilinda easily defeated Minor, winning 69% of the vote. In the general election, she faced Kirk Headley-Purdue, who did not present much of a challenge to her, and she comfortably won with 59% of the vote.
When districts were redrawn in 2012, Rehwinkel Vasilinda remained in the 9th District, which became solely located in Leon County. She faced Bradley L. Maxwell, the Republican nominee who had previously run against former State Representative Curtis Richardson in 2000, as her general election opponent.

Serafino De Tivoli

Serafino De Tivoli (March 18261892) was an Italian painter of the Macchiaioli group.
Biography.
He was born in Livorno. After initial study of literature at a religious private school in Florence, he began his artistic training under Carlo Markò the Elder. He met Vito D'Ancona during the mid-1840s, and joined him in painting landscapes "en plein air". 
In 1848 he fought as a Tuscan volunteer for Garibaldi in the Risorgimento. In 1855 his paintings, exhibited at the Florentine Promotrice exhibition, brought him to the attention of the artists who frequented the Caffè Michelangiolo in Florence (including those who would later become known as the Macchiaioli). In that same year he traveled to Paris, where he was greatly impressed by the paintings of the Barbizon school. He saw in their realism and powerful chiaroscuro a means of renewing art in the modern age. Upon his return to Florence he conveyed this new enthusiasm to his friends, who quickly adopted his ideas. In recognition of the influence he had on his fellow Florentine artists, Telemaco Signorini called him "the father of the "macchia"". 
De Tivoli made additional visits to Paris, and in 1863 he exhibited in the Salon des Refusés. In 1873 he moved to Paris, where he met such artists as Tissot and Pissarro, and became a friend of Degas. He returned to Florence in 1890, where he lived in relative isolation until his death in 1892.

Criminal Investigation Department (Ireland)

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in the Irish Free State was an armed, plain-clothed counter-insurgency police unit that operated during the Irish Civil War. It was organised separately from the unarmed Civic Guard police force. The unit was formed shortly after the truce with the British (11 July 1921) and disbanded in October 1923.
Formation.
The CID was created by Michael Collins and many of its personnel were former Irish Republican Army fighters whom he had commanded during the Irish War of Independence. In particular, a number came from the Squad, a Dublin based IRA assassination unit. The unit had close links with the Army Intelligence and with a smaller 'Protective Corps' which was based in the same building, Oriel House on Westland Row, Dublin. Initially, they were put under the command of Liam Tobin. On 31 July 1922, it was taken out of the control of military intelligence and put under the brief of TD Joseph McGrath. Its commanding officer was Captain Pat Moynihan. Moynihan was given temporary transfer from his post as Head of Military Intelligence and with the rank of Captain took over Oriel House for this new force.
On 22 August 1922 (the same day as Collins' death in an ambush) the Criminal Investigation Department was officially formed to 'be distinct from existing police forces with separate headquarters under direct control of the Minister for Home Affairs.' It was formed from members of the National Army and the Irish Republican Police and was based at Oriel House. It consisted of over 100 heavily armed men and three women detectives who were 'cloaked' as typists and 'engaged in special duties connected with the detection of women engaged in hostilities against the Government.' The unit later reached a peak strength of 350 in February 1923.
Moynihan selected as 'Chief Superintendent', Peter Ennis. Ennis had been the commanding officer of the Irish Republican Police in Dublin during the 1919–1921 war, and was a brother of General Tom Ennis of the Free State's National Army. Ennis brought with him about fifteen of his old Republican Police to Oriel House and they formed the nucleus of the new 'CID'. Initially it was to have been a military structure, but the 'Privates' of 1922 ended up as 'Detective Officers' by its disbandment in 1923. Broy, Nelligan and MacNamara, of the DMP 'G' Branch were there in the beginning, but all got high ranks in the National Army Intelligence Department and went instead to Wellington Barracks where their HQ was located
During the Civil War.
During the conflict of 1922–1923, the CID was responsible for the arrest of over 500 Anti-Treaty IRA fighters as well as the seizure of much weaponry and documentation. It had files on over 2,500 republican suspects.
It was also accused of using brutal interrogation techniques and of the assassination of republican suspects and prisoners.
Among a large number of incidents in which the CID was implicated was the killing of five republicans in two separate incidents on 26 and 29 August 1922 and the dumping of the bodies in Drumcondra and Clondalkin suburbs. By 9 September, British Intelligence had reported that CID was believed to have, 'killed a number of prominent republicans' in Dublin. There were many other such killings of Anti-Treaty activists by plain-clothed men in the Dublin area during the war, such as Bobby Bondfield in March 1923 and Noel Lemass in July of that year. Senior republican Thomas Derrig also had an eye shot out while in CID custody.
It is possible, however that some of these killings were carried out by other agencies such as elements of the National Army, or by soldiers and CID men, but popularly attributed to 'Oriel House'. In his book-'Salute to the men of '22', Brian O'Higgins documented at least twenty-five murders of Republicans in the Dublin area alone. In the conflict as whole, as many as 153 republican prisoners were summarily executed in the field. (See also: executions during the Irish Civil War.)
A study of the period concluded, 'Oriel House succeeded in its task of suppressing small scale republican activities in the Dublin area, not by the sophistication and efficiency its intelligence work... but by the more direct method of striking terror into its opponents.
A total of four CID personnel were killed in the war. A number of attempts were also made to blow up Oriel House itself.
Disbandment.
On 29 October 1923 the Oriel House CID was disbanded and 30 of its members were transferred to the Dublin Metropolitan Police as detectives. They later formed the basis of the Garda Special Branch. The CID as a whole was considered unsuitable for a police force in peacetime. In April 1925 the DMP was amalgamated with the Garda Síochána.

Brick House on the Pike

The Brick House on the Pike is a historic home located at Ellicott City, Howard County, Maryland, United States. It is a large two-story, side-passage, double-pile plan house constructed in two phases, a brick structure built by Caleb Dorsey replacing a wooden structure when he bought the property at the end of the 18th century, and the larger more formal section built by his son Charles Worthington Dorsey about 1817. Also on the property and contemporary with the main house are an ice house foundation, a stone stable or carriage house and three board-and-batten outbuildings dating from the late 19th or early 20th century. The early Federal features of the house were left essentially untouched in the alterations that took place about 1907, and have remained intact. Edward Hammond undertook this modernization after being given the house as a wedding present by the father of his wife, Reubena Rogers. Electricity, central heat, and a capacious front porch were added, and the roof of the older section of the house was raised, creating a full second floor with dormer windows. Public water, sewer, gas, and modernization of utilities were accomplished between 1995 and 2009 by Dr Edward Rogers, a direct descendant of Caleb Dorsey. The previous owners, the Lassotovitch, Hammond, Ligon, and Dorsey families are all related. Governor Thomas Watkins Ligon (1810–1881) of Maryland lived in the house, having married a Dorsey, before they moved to White Hall, nearby.
The Brick House on the Pike was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.
