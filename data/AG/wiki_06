Theories of the Black Death

Several possible causes exist that might have led to the Black Death.
Bubonic plague theory.
Several possible causes for the bubonic plague (plague spread by fleas) have been advanced for the Black Death; the most prevalent is the Bubonic plague theory. Efficient transmission of "Yersinia pestis" is generally thought to occur only through the bites of fleas whose mid guts become obstructed by replicating "Y. pestis" several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by fleas that repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. However, modelling of epizootic plague observed in prairie dogs, suggests that occasional reservoirs of infection such as an infectious carcass, rather than "blocked fleas" are a better explanation for the observed epizootic behaviour of the disease in nature.
An interesting hypothesis about the epidemiology—the appearance, spread, and especially disappearance—of plague from Europe is that the flea-bearing rodent reservoir of disease was eventually succeeded by another species. The Black Rat ("Rattus rattus") was originally introduced from Asia to Europe by trade, but was subsequently displaced and succeeded throughout Europe by the bigger Brown Rat ("Rattus norvegicus"). The brown rat was not as prone to transmit the germ-bearing fleas to humans in large die-offs due to a different rat ecology. The dynamic complexities of rat ecology, herd immunity in that reservoir, interaction with human ecology, secondary transmission routes between humans with or without fleas, human herd immunity, and changes in each might explain the eruption, dissemination, and re-eruptions of plague that continued for centuries until its unexplained disappearance.
Signs and symptoms of the three plagues.
The three forms of plague brought an array of signs and symptoms to those infected. The septicaemic plague is a form of "blood poisoning", and pneumonic plague is an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body. The classic sign of bubonic plague was the appearance of buboes in the groin, the neck, and armpits, which oozed pus and bled. Most victims died within four to seven days after infection. When the plague reached Europe, it first struck port cities and then followed the trade routes, both by sea and land.
The bubonic plague was the most commonly seen form during the Black Death, with a mortality rate of thirty to seventy-five percent and symptoms including fever of 38–41 °C (101–105 °F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Of those who contracted the bubonic plague, four out of five died within eight days. Pneumonic plague was the second most commonly seen form during the Black Death, with a mortality rate of ninety to ninety-five percent. Symptoms included fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progressed, sputum became free flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague was the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate close to one hundred percent. Symptoms were high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to DIC).
David Herlihy identifies another potential sign of the plague: freckle-like spots and rashes. Sources from Viterbo, Italy refer to "the signs which are vulgarly called "lenticulae"", a word which bears resemblance to the Italian word for freckles, "lentiggini". These are not the swellings of buboes, but rather "darkish points or pustules which covered large areas of the body".
Molecular evidence for "Y. pestis" and objections.
In 2000, Didier Raoult and others reported finding "Y. pestis" DNA by performing a "suicide PCR" on tooth pulp tissue from a fourteenth-century plague cemetery in Montpellier.
Drancourt and Raoult reported similar findings in a 2007 study.
However, other researchers argued the study was flawed and cited contrary evidence. In 2003, Susan Scott of the University of Liverpool argued that there was no conclusive reason to believe the Montpellier teeth were from Black Death victims.
Also in 2003, a team led by Alan Cooper from Oxford University tested 121 teeth from sixty-six skeletons found in 14th century mass graves, including well-documented Black Death plague pits in East Smithfield and Spitalfields. Their results showed no genetic evidence for "Y. pestis", and Cooper concluded that though "e cannot rule out Yersinia as the cause of the Black Death ...right now there is no molecular evidence for it."
Research published in 2012 argues that carbon dating of the Spitalfields burials placed them earlier than the Black Death, around 1250 AD, and that they were the result of a catastrophic volcano eruption in 1257/1258 which affected much of the world and led to the deaths of perhaps one-third of the population of London. Osteologist Don Walker of the Museum of London was quoted as saying "These people living in medieval London would have had no idea that this global event – one of the largest volcanic eruptions of the Holocene, which is the last 10,000 years, and certainly the largest of the last millennium – was causing the problems."
Additional molecular evidence.
In October 2010 the journal "PLoS Pathogens" published a paper Haensch et al. (2010) by a multinational team that investigated the role of "Yersinia pestis" in the Black Death. The paper detailed the results of new surveys that combined ancient DNA analyses and protein-specific detection which were used to find DNA and protein signatures specific for "Y. pestis" in human skeletons from widely distributed mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany
Significantly, the study also identified two previously unknown but related clades (genetic branches) of the "Y. pestis" genome that were associated with distinct medieval mass graves. These were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern "Y. pestis" strains Orientalis and Medievalis, suggesting that these variant strains (which are now presumed to be extinct) may have entered Europe in two distinct waves.
Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate that the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three successive epidemics. However, surveys of plague pit remains from the Netherlands town of Bergen op Zoom showed that the "Y. pestis" genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying that Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in AD 1349, suggesting that a second wave of plague infection, distinct from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the Hanseatic cities, or another site.
Alternative explanations.
Not bubonic plague?
Although "Y. pestis" as the causitive agent of plague is widely accepted, recent scientific and historical investigations have led some researchers to doubt the long-held belief that the Black Death was an epidemic of bubonic plague.
In 2002, Samuel K. Cohn published the controversial article, “The Black Death: End of the Paradigm”. In the article Cohn argues that the medieval and modern plagues were two distinct diseases differing in their symptoms, signs, and epidemiologies. Cohn asserts that the agent causing the bubonic plague, "Yersinia pestis", “was first cultured at Hong Kong in 1894.” In turn, the medieval plague that struck Europe, according to Cohn, was not the bubonic plague carried by fleas on rats as traditionally viewed by scientists and historians alike.
Cohn’s argument that medieval plague was not rat-based is supported by his claims that the modern and medieval plagues hit in different seasons (a claim supported in a 2009 article by Mark Welford and Brian Bossak), had unparalleled cycles of recurrence, and varied in the manner in which immunity was acquired. The modern plague reaches its peak in seasons with high humidity and a temperature of between and , as rats’ fleas thrive in this climate. In comparison, the Black Death is recorded as hitting in periods where rats’ fleas could not survive, i.e. hot Mediterranean summers above . In terms of recurrence, the Black Death on average did not resurface in an area for between five and fifteen years after it hit. Contrastingly, modern plagues often hit an affected area yearly for an average of eight to forty years. Last, Cohn presents evidence displaying that individuals gained immunity to the Black Death during the fourteenth century, unlike the modern plague. He states that in 1348 two-thirds of those suffering from plague died in comparison to one-twentieth by 1382. Statistics contrastingly display that immunity to the modern plague has not been acquired.
Cohn also points out that in the latter part of the nineteenth century buboes appeared mostly on an infected person's groin, while medieval primary sources indicate that the Black Death caused buboes to appear on necks, armpits, and groins. This difference, he argues, ties in with the fact that fleas caused the modern plague and not the Black Death. Since flea bites do not usually reach beyond a person's ankles, in the modern period the groin was the nearest lymph node that could be infected. As the neck and the armpit were often infected during the medieval plague, it appears less likely that these infections were caused by fleas on rats.
In 1984, Graham Twigg published "The Black Death: A Biological Reappraisal", where he argued that the climate and ecology of Europe and particularly England made it nearly impossible for rats and fleas to have transmitted bubonic plague. Combining information on the biology of "Rattus rattus", "Rattus norvegicus", and the common fleas "Xenopsylla cheopis" and "Pulex irritans" with modern studies of plague epidemiology, particularly in India, where the "R. rattus" is a native species and conditions are nearly ideal for plague to be spread, Twigg concludes that it would have been nearly impossible for "Yersinia pestis" to have been the causative agent of the plague, let alone its explosive spread across Europe. Twigg also shows that the common theory of entirely pneumonic spread does not hold up. He proposes, based on a reexamination of the evidence and symptoms, that the Black Death may actually have been an epidemic of pulmonary anthrax caused by "Bacillus anthracis".
An Ebola-like virus?
In 2001, Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan, respectively a demographer and zoologist from Liverpool University, proposed the theory that the Black Death might have been caused by an Ebola-like virus, not a bacterium. Their rationale was that this plague spread much faster and the incubation period was much longer than other confirmed "Y. pestis"–caused plagues. A longer period of incubation will allow carriers of the infection to travel farther and infect more people than a shorter one. When the primary vector is humans, as opposed to birds, this is of great importance. Epidemiological studies suggest the disease was transferred between humans (which happens rarely with "Yersinia pestis" and very rarely for "Bacillus anthracis"), and some genes that determine immunity to Ebola-like viruses are much more widespread in Europe than in other parts of the world. Their research and findings are thoroughly documented in "Biology of Plagues". More recently the researchers have published computer modeling
demonstrating how the Black Death has made around 10% of Europeans resistant to HIV.
Anthrax and others?
In a similar vein, historian Norman Cantor, in "In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It made" (2001), suggests the Black Death might have been a combination of pandemics including a form of anthrax, a cattle murrain. He cites many forms of evidence including: reported disease symptoms not in keeping with the known effects of either bubonic or pneumonic plague, the discovery of anthrax spores in a plague pit in Scotland, and the fact that meat from infected cattle was known to have been sold in many rural English areas prior to the onset of the plague. The means of infection varied widely, with infection in the absence of living or recently dead humans in Sicily (which speaks against most viruses). Also, diseases with similar symptoms were generally not distinguished between in that period (see "murrain" above), at least not in the Christian world; Chinese and Muslim medical records can be expected to yield better information which however only pertains to the specific disease(s) which affected these areas.
Cutaneous anthrax infection in humans shows up as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center (eschar), often beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot. Cutaneous infections generally form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Without treatment about 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death. Respiratory infection in humans initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days, followed by severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse. Historical mortality was 92%. Gastrointestinal infection in humans is most often caused by eating anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious gastrointestinal difficulty, vomiting of blood, severe diarrhea, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite. After the bacteria invades the bowel system, it spreads through the bloodstream throughout the body, making more toxins on the way.
Counter-arguments.
Historians who believe that the Black Death was indeed caused by bubonic plague have put forth several counterarguments.
The uncharacteristically rapid spread of the plague could be due to respiratory droplet transmission, and low levels of immunity in the European population at that period. Historical examples of pandemics of other diseases in populations without previous exposure, such as smallpox and tuberculosis transmitted by aerosol amongst Native Americans, show that the first instance of an epidemic spreads faster and is far more virulent than later instances among the descendants of survivors, for whom natural selection has produced characteristics that are protective against the disease.
Michael McCormick, a historian offering the idea that bubonic plague was indeed the source of the Black Death, explains how archaeological research has confirmed that the black or "ship" rat was indeed present in Roman and medieval Europe. Also, the DNA of "Y. pestis" has been identified in the teeth of the human victims, the same DNA which has been widely believed to have come from the infected rodents. He does not deny the point that there exists a pneumonic expression of "Y. pestis" transmitted by human-to-human contact, but he states that this does not spread as easily as previous historians have imagined. The rat, according to him, is the only plausible agent of transmission that could have led to such a wide and quick spread of the plague. This is because of rats' proclivity to associate with humans and the ability of their blood to withstand very large concentrations of the bacillus. When rats died, their fleas (which were infected with bacterial blood) found new hosts in the form of humans and animals. The Black Death tapered off in the eighteenth century, and according to McCormick, a rat-based theory of transmission could explain why this occurred. The plague(s) had killed a large portion of the human host population of Europe and dwindling cities meant that more people were isolated, and so geography and demography did not allow rats to have as much contact with Europeans. Greatly curtailed communication and transportation systems due to the drastic decline in human population also hindered the replenishment of devastated rat colonies.

Kunming Institute of Botany

Kunming Institute of Botany, or KIB (), founded in 1938, is a research institution in the field of Botany, which is located in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, China. 
The Institute is one of the major herbariums in China and maintains a collection of over 1,000,000 specimens of plant.
The Institute also has a botanical garden. Currently there are around 5,000 species of vascular plants in the botanical garden. There are several sections, with specific collections, such as:
All the plants that are hosted in the botanical garden are a foundation on which to work, for the research and experience of the staff of scientists at the Institute. Studies are conducted to improve the cultivation of plants of economic interest, with a view to better use, both nutritionally and industrially. Currently a digital database of the botanical garden is being prepared, as well as of wild plants in the province of Yunnan.
Germplasm Bank of Wild Species.
A comprehensive research and preservation facility for the germplasm of rare and endangered plants, wild animal species and microorganisms was completed in 2007 at the KIB.
With an investment of 148 million yuan (18.5 million U.S. dollars) over two years, the "Southwest China Germplasm Bank of Wild Species" facility was established by the Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB) with the help of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
The bank is a key player in China's biotech industry and a pioneer in the nation's biodiversity conservation and bioresource development strategy.
According to the KIB, the bank sees itself as a leading storage facility of Asian species within 15 years of its foundation, and expects to make significant contributions to the development of the biotech industry and life science research by providing valuable resources, information and expertise.
Within the next five years, the bank is expected to collect 6,450 wild species, 4,000 of which will be plant seed species. Within 15 years, its collection will reach 19,000 species.
The bank comprises a seed section, an in-vitro micro-propagation unit, a microorganism bank, an animal germplasm bank, a DNA bank, an information center and a garden.
Stretching across an undulating landscape and climatic zones ranging from the tropical to the frigid, Yunnan is home to a multitude of plant species linked together by a complex network of phylogenetic relations, and accounts for more than 50 percent of China's plant diversity.
It is China's largest seed bank.

Joey and the Twisters

Joey and the Twisters was a Twist (dance) group formed from remnants of the original Royal Teens around 1961. The group was led by Teens vocalist Joey Villa (aka Joe Francovilla), along with several other members from the local Manhattan Doo-Wop scene. The band played regularly at the Peppermint Lounge in Manhattan, alongside Joey Dee and the Starliters and other acts.
The Twisters never released an album, but did release several singles on Duel Records, including remakes of Bobby Darin's "Jailer, Bring me Water," Bobby Freeman's "Do You Want to Dance," and "Bony Maronie," and penned "Peppermint Twist Time" in honor of the club that gave them a home.
They did launch on a national tour, the highlight of which was playing the Dream Room in New Orleans, and they appeared on Dick Clark's American Bandstand on New Year's Day, 1962. 
The group dissolved as the Twist fell out of fashion. Joey Villa continued playing as a solo artist. Bob Azzara and Louis Burgio, along with friend Flip Cesario, who briefly played with the Royal Teens, later formed the band Mardi Gras (music group).

Sainsbury's Online

Sainsbury's Online is an electronic commerce website operated by Sainsbury's, the UK's third largest supermarket chain. It offers a wide range of other products, including electronic goods, books and financial services.
Sainsbury's started e-commerce home delivery operations in 1995 when it introduced ‘Wine Direct' for internet wine sales. In 1996, on Monday 30 December it was announced that Sainsbury's has joined forces with Hewlett-Packard for the development of an Internet-based supermarket offering a full range of products. The new supermarket was expected to be launched in March 1997. In 1998 the service was extended back to food with the launch of ‘Orderline'. This enabled customers to order their shopping via telephone, fax or the internet and have it delivered to their front door.
On 22 November 1999 Sainsbury's started e-business in partnership with LineOne. On 23 March 2000 J Sainsbury plc announced a business-to-business e-commerce venture and on 12 April 2000 the home shopping service was re-branded 'Sainsbury's to You' and 'Sainsbury's entertain You'.
Following the appointment of Justin King as Chief Executive in 2004, the home delivery service has once again been re-branded, to 'Sainsbury's Online', although its vans are sprayed with 'sainsburys.co.uk'. The company closed down its online entertainment home shopping service in 2007 due to losses, with a slimmed down range complementary to the core grocery shop.
On the evening of 25 July 2009, around 6pm, Sainsbury's launched 4,500 non-food products online, increasing to 8,000 products by September 2009, to help compete with Tesco.com and Asda.com. The re-launched website includes the core categories of Food and Drink, Home and Garden, Technology, Appliances, Toys and Games, Sports and Leisure and Finance. However, Sainsbury's does not offer a catalogue service like Tesco and Asda.

Black Death in medieval culture

The Black Death had a profound effect on medieval culture, and dominated art and literature throughout the generation that experienced it. Black Death, known at the time as the "Great Pestilence" or the "Great Plague", or simply as "The Plague", peaked in Europe between 1348 and 1350, although smaller outbreaks continued to surface across the Continent until the 17th Century, and the threat of the pandemic returning was present throughout the Late Middle Ages. 
Although contemporary chronicles are often regarded by historians as the most realistic portrayals of the Black Death, the effects of such a large-scale shared experience on the population of Europe influenced poetry, prose, stage works, music and artwork throughout the period, as evidenced by writers such as Chaucer, Boccaccio, Petrarch and artists such as Holbein.
Chronicles.
Much of the most useful manifestations of the Black Death in literature, to historians, comes from the accounts of its chroniclers; contemporary accounts are often the only real way to get a sense of the horror of living through a disaster on such a scale. A few of these chroniclers were famous writers, philosophers and rulers (like Boccaccio and Petrarch). Their writings, however, did not reach the majority of the European population. For example, Petrarch's work was read mainly by wealthy nobles and merchants of Italian city-states. He wrote hundreds of letters and vernacular poetry of great distinction and passed on to later generations a revised interpretation of courtly love. There was, however, one troubadour, writing in the lyric style long out of fashion, who was active in 1348. Peire Lunel de Montech composed the sorrowful "sirventes" "Meravilhar no·s devo pas las gens" during the height of the plague in Toulouse.
Although romances continued to be popular throughout the period, the courtly tradition began to face increasing competition from ordinary writers who became involved in producing gritty realist literature, inspired by their Black Death experiences. This was a new phenomenon, made possible because vernacular education and literature, as well as the study of Latin and classical antiquity, flourished widely, making the written word steadily more accessible during the fourteenth century. For example, Agnolo di Tura, of Siena, records his experience:
The scene Di Tura describes is repeated over and over again all across Europe. In Sicily, Gabriele de' Mussi, a notary, tells of the early spread from the Crimea:
Henry Knighton tells of the plague's coming to England:
Friar John Clyn witnessed its effects in Leinster, after its spread to Ireland in August 1348:
In literature.
In addition to these personal accounts, many presentations of the Black Death have entered the general consciousness as great literature. For example, the major works of Boccaccio ("The Decameron"), Petrarch, Geoffrey Chaucer ("The Canterbury Tales"), and William Langland ("Piers Plowman"), which all discuss the Black Death, are generally recognized as some of the best works of their era.
"La Danse Macabre", or the "Dance of death", was a contemporary allegory, expressed as art, drama, and printed work. Its theme was the universality of death, expressing the common wisdom of the time: that no matter one's station in life, the dance of death united all. It consists of the personified Death leading a row of dancing figures from all walks of life to the grave – typically with an emperor, king, pope, monk, youngster, beautiful girl, all in skeleton-state. They were produced under the impact of the Black Death, reminding people of how fragile their lives were and how vain the glories of earthly life. The earliest artistic example is from the frescoed cemetery of the Church of the Holy Innocents in Paris (1424). There are also works by Konrad Witz in Basel (1440), Bernt Notke in Lübeck (1463) and woodcuts by Hans Holbein the Younger (1538). Israil Bercovici claims that the "Danse Macabre" originated among Sephardic Jews in fourteenth century Spain (Bercovici, 1992, p. 27).
The poem "The Rattle Bag" by the Welsh poet Dafydd ap Gwilym (1315–1350 or 1340–1370) has many elements that suggest that it was written as a reflection of the hardships he endured during the Black Death. It also reflects his personal belief that the Black Death was the end of humanity, the Apocalypse, as suggested by his multiple biblical references, particularly the events described in the Book of Revelation.
Thomas Nashe also wrote a sonnet about the plague entitled "A Litany in Time of Plague" which was part of "Summers last will and Testament" (1592). He made countryside visits to remove himself from London in fear of the plague.
Additionally see Aleksandr Pushkin's verse play, "Feast in the Time of the Plague".
Influence on European folklore.
The Black Death quickly entered common folklore in many European countries. In Northern Europe, the plague was personified as an old, bent woman covered and hooded in black, carrying a broom and a rake. Norwegians told that if she used the rake, some of the population involved might survive, escaping through the teeth of the rake. If she on the other hand used the broom, then the entire population in the area were doomed. The Plague-hag, or "Pesta", were vividly drawn by the painter Theodor Kittelsen.
Women during and after the Black Death also benefited from the growing importance of vernacular literature because a broader cultural forum became available to them which had previously been restricted to men by the Latin church. And so, they began writing and fostering through patronage the writings and translations of others. For example, in France, Christine de Pizan (1364–1430) became the first woman in Europe to support herself by writing. She wrote in many different literary forms, such as an autobiography and books of moral advice for men and women, as well as poetry on a wide range of topics. In her treatise "The Letter to the God of Love", she responded to Jean de Meun's anti-feminist writings found in his conclusion of "Romance of the Rose". Her treatise marked the first instance in European history where a woman was able to respond to such diatribes in writing. It also led to a debate among de Meun and Pizan sympathizers which lasted until the sixteenth century.

Sainsbury's Freezer Centres

Sainsbury's Freezer Centres was a former frozen food chain, operated by the then largest UK supermarket chain (now the third largest supermarket chain) Sainsbury's.
The company decided to open the shops in response to competition from specialist frozen food chains, such as Bejam. It also allowed Sainsbury's to make use of its valuable freehold counter service stores (that were too small for conversion to self-service).
The first shop opened at Southbourne near Bournemouth in 1974. It was not an immediate success as many of the elderly residents living in the area did not own a freezer. Only 11% of households at that time owned freezers. Nine other branches that followed suit in that year, however, had greater success. They sold about 3,000 lines, many with deep discounts.
In 1975, new build stores or refurbished ones had frozen food departments built into them. Chippenham was the first branch to have this integrated.
By 1980, there were 21 freezer centres, and by 1982, 49% of households owned a freezer.
Sainsbury's sold Sainsbury's Freezer Centres to Bejam in 1986. In 1989, Bejam became part of the Iceland chain.

Centre for Mental Health

The Centre for Mental Health is an independent UK mental health charity. It aims to inspire hope, opportunity and a fair chance in life for people of all ages with or at risk of mental ill health. The Centre acts as a bridge between the worlds of research, policy and service provision and believes strongly in the importance of high-quality evidence and analysis. It encourages innovation and advocates for change in policy and practice through focused research, development and training.
History.
The Centre was founded in 1985 by the Sainsbury family, via a charitable trust called the Gatsby Charitable Foundation. This has always provided the vast majority of its funding, but it is due to run out in 2010. The Centre's income in 2008 was just over £2.5 million.
Centre for Mental Health began in March 1985 as the National Unit for Psychiatric Research and Development (NUPRD). It was founded by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, an independent grant-making trust set up by Lord Sainsbury of Turville to 'advance education and learning in the science and practise of mental health care, to promote research into mental health and publish the useful results and to assist the provision of mental health care for those in need of it'. The aim was for NUPRD to tackle these issues by working in a different way to other organisations. NUPRD was staffed by a small group of people working in an office at Lewisham Hospital. After 1989 it became known as Research and Development for Psychiatry (RDP) and then moved into the current offices on Borough High Street.
In February 1992, it became 'Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health'. Sainsbury Centre was at the centre of developing and helping to implement the National Service Framework for Mental Health. In 1995, it evaluated the Blackthorn Trust garden (in Maidstone,Kent) and its therapies for 2 years. 
From 2006, it changed its work to focus on mental health and employment, in which it already had an established programme, and a new area of work on mental health and the criminal justice system. In 2007 it launched a new look and logo to accompany this change in focus.
The Gatsby Charitable Foundation, one of the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts, provided the Centre's core funding each year from 1985. In 2009 it announced that it would be spending out its funds in following few years, and its annual grant to the Centre would cease in 2010. It has now done so, and the Centre has made plans for new working arrangements for the future. In 2010 the Gatsby Foundation announced a final grant covering three years.
Since July 2010, the charity has been known as Centre for Mental Health.

Nik Wallenda

Nikolas "Nik" Wallenda (born January 24, 1979) is an American acrobat, aerialist, daredevil, and high wire artist. Described as "The King of the Wire", he is known for his high-wire performances without a safety net. He holds seven Guinness World Records for various acrobatic feats, but is best known as the first person to walk a tightrope stretched directly over Niagara Falls on June 15, 2012; the feat was broadcast internationally. The walk came after a two-year legal battle involving both sides of the Canada–United States border to gain approval. For the walk he was required to wear a safety harness for the first time in his life.
A seventh-generation member of The Flying Wallendas family, Nik Wallenda participated in various circus acts as a child. At age 13, he made his professional tightrope walking debut. He decided on high-wire walking as a career path in 1998, after joining family members in a seven-person pyramid on the wire. In 2001, Wallenda was part of the world's first seven-person high-wire pyramid. From 2002 to 2005, he performed with his family at various venues, forming his own troupe in 2005. During 2007 and 2008, he performed with Bello Nock in a double version of the Wheel of Steel that he helped invent. In 2009, he set new personal bests for highest and longest tightrope walks, completing a total of 15 walks above in the air that year.
In 2008, Wallenda set Guinness World Records for longest and highest bicycle ride on a high-wire ride at above the ground in New Jersey. He nearly doubled the height record in 2010 to . On the same day in 2010, he upped his personal best by tightrope walking over in a single performance. In 2011, Wallenda set a world record by performing on the Wheel of Death atop the 23 story Tropicana Casino and Resort. Later that year, Wallenda and his mother tightrope walked between the two towers of Condado Plaza Hotel in Puerto Rico. The feat was a re-creation of the one that had killed Karl Wallenda, Nik's great-grandfather and primary source of inspiration. On June 10, 2011, Wallenda hung from a helicopter off the ground using only his teeth to hold on.
A reality show following Wallenda's feats aired on the Science Channel in 2012. In 2013, he released a memoir entitled "Balance". On June 23, 2013, he became the first person to high-wire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge (crossing the Little Colorado River outside Grand Canyon National Park). Wallenda is married with three children, and considers his Christian faith to be a central aspect of his life.
Background.
Wallenda is a seventh-generation member of The Flying Wallendas family of aerialists. His ancestors, primarily of Austro-Hungarian descent, have been circus performers since the 1700s and have been doing balancing acts without nets since Karl Wallenda made the family famous for the feat in the 1920s. Nik Wallenda is a direct descendant of Karl, whom he calls his role model and his "biggest hero in life". Karl "didn’t do the ordinary. He has always inspired me", Nik explained. Nik has called growing up in the Wallenda family an honor and "like standing on the shoulders of giants. They've created a legacy that has gone on for seven generations and I've been able to continue it along."
Several members of the family have lost their lives while training or performing. In 1962, the troupe's famous seven-person pyramid collapsed, killing two family members and paralyzing Wallenda's uncle Mario. In 1978, Karl Wallenda died after falling from a tight rope at age 73 in Puerto Rico.
Early life.
Nik Wallenda was born in Sarasota, Florida, on January 24, 1979, to Delilah Wallenda and Terry Troffer. At age two, his parents bought him a swing set. Before Troffer had even finished assembling it, Wallenda climbed up to the crossbar and did a somersault. "And he did it perfectly," Troffer recalls. "I didn't teach him that." Around the same time, he began performing with his family in their circus act. Wallenda's first public performance, dressed as a clown, was at SeaWorld San Diego in 1981. He began to play on the wire at age two, walking back and forth while holding his mother's hand. At age four, he starting walking the wire on his own, learning primarily from his father. As a child, he would play on his parent's practice wire with his older sister Lijana, two feet (0.6 m) off the ground. Wallenda's parents would throw objects at him as he practiced, and even shot him with a BB gun, to train him to deal with distractions. At age six, he first visited Niagara Falls and immediately decided that one day he wanted to walk a tightrope across it. He spent most of his youth on the road, living in a mobile home as his parents performed across America. However, Wallenda says there was never any family pressure to become a circus performer.
As Wallenda grew, he transitioned from being a clown to juggling to a dog act. In 1991, at age 12, he told a reporter he was not interested in becoming a high-wire artist when he grew up. "It's just not worth it," he explained. "We're risking our lives out there. We could die." Instead, he said, he dreamed of being a pilot. Soon after, Wallenda made his professional tightrope walking debut at age 13. When he graduated high school, his parents encouraged him to go to college and explore his options. With live circus losing popularity, becoming a performer did not seem like a viable career path. Delilah Wallenda wrote a book, "The Last of the Wallendas", convinced that the family legacy would end with her generation.
Wallenda briefly considered becoming a doctor, and was accepted into college. However, his plans changed in 1998. At age 19, he participated in a re-creation of Karl Wallenda's seven-person pyramid on the high-wire in Detroit, Michigan, alongside his father, mother, and other family members. Afterwards, he decided to make a career of it. "I knew then what I was born to do," he later said. "We were on every TV show around the world and I said, 'if there is this much attention on what I do, then I need to carry on this legacy'". He saw there was still interest in the Wallenda name. "There was definitely a future" for the Wallendas, he later recalled. "industry is not dying, it's just changing."
Career.
Nik Wallenda has produced a variety of large-scale productions for amusement parks and similar venues in several countries. The acts often feature him alongside family members, especially his wife Erendira. Wallenda's children are sometimes part of the act. His youngest child, Evita, has been performing balancing feats since she would balance in the palm of her father's hand at six months old. Wallenda's shows have incorporated water and diving feats, the Wheel of Death, incline motorcycles, aerial silk and hoop, the globe of death, and of course the high-wire. "We've performed nearly every circus or daredevil skill there is," claims Wallenda. "I like to mix it up", he says. "It keeps family on our toes and gives the public something new to see every year." Wallenda's father, Terry Troffer, serves as his safety coordinator, having retired from acrobatics after 36 years in the business. Troffer's brother Mike serves as chief engineer. Wallenda has never had a serious accident, describing the worst injury of his life as a broken toe while playing football.
Wallenda performs without a safety net or harness. "My great-grandfather taught that safety nets offer a false sense of security," he explains. He notes that a safety net is no guarantee – an uncle was killed while performing despite falling into a safety net. However, he says he does not have a "death wish in any way. I plan on living and dying a natural death when I'm old." Asked about fear, he remarked "I would say the only thing I fear is God". He adds that his Christian faith allows him to "know where I'm going to go when I die ... I'm not scared of dying."
Wallenda says that the high-wire performance is not a daredevil act or a mere stunt, but rather an athletic feat requiring great physical training. "I see a stunt as somebody who gets in a barrel and goes over the edge and hopes they don't hit a rock," he said commenting on his walk across Niagara Falls. "What I do is very calculated. I train a long time for it and I consider it more of an art. I guess I don't get offended by calling it a stunt, but to me it's more of an art than anything." He aims to be "over-prepared" for every event he does, training six hours a day, six days a week. He does ten hours of weight training and five hours of aerobic exercise each week. Even so, he says wire walking is primarily a mental skill.
Wallenda has developed several tricks that he often incorporates into his high-wire routine including stopping to make a phone call, sitting on the wire, and lying down on the wire. He is said to be "obsessed" with the technological aspects of his acts, insisting on calculating every detail himself. When asked why he risks his life on the high-wire, he replied "I do this because I love what I do ... If I won the lottery tomorrow, I'd still be doing what I do." "Walking the wire to me is life," he adds. Wallenda and his family spend roughly 48 weeks per year on the road.
As of 2013, Wallenda has a contract with the Discovery Channel for near-exclusive broadcast of his acts. He carries a US$20-million insurance policy. He has called his career "extremely lucrative, more lucrative than I would have ever dreamed of." He plans to retire at age 50.
Early career.
In 2001, Wallenda appeared with seven other family members at Japan's Kurashiki Tivoli Park in an attempt at the world's first ever eight-person high-wire pyramid. After five months of four hours per day, six days a week preparation, the family successfully walked across a tightrope in six minutes, setting a Guinness World Record. Nik Wallenda cited Karl Wallenda as the primary inspiration for the feat, and stated, "It was a landmark experience for our profession, as well as our family and me personally."
From 2002 to 2005, Wallenda performed alongside his wife, children, and other family members at Wet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe in Greensboro, North Carolina. They also toured the United States as part of various circuses. One early act featured Wallenda riding a motorcycle across the high-wire in the air. In 2005, Wallenda and his wife, Erendira, took their act to Raging Waters in San Dimas, California, while his mother and sister stayed at Wet 'n Wild. Throughout this time period, Wallenda continued to participate in the family's signature seven-person pyramid.
In 2006, McDonald's sponsored a show in Detroit. To promote the restaurant's new coffee, Nik Wallenda and his older sister Lijana did an act where they met in the middle of a high-wire and sat down to have some coffee, after starting on opposite ends. After exchanging several toasts, Nik stood up and stepped over his sister. As the siblings headed back to their platforms, a crane winch malfunctioned, preventing Lijana from exiting the wire. After Nik descended to the ground, a crane was moved to reduce the tension on the wire and he rode a hook up to rescue his sister.
Wheel of Steel.
In 2007 and 2008, Wallenda was a featured performer in the Ringling Brothers production "Bellobration", performing with Bello Nock on a newly contrived, double version of the Wheel of Steel. At the beginning of the act, Wallenda and Nock stood balanced atop twin circles 39 feet in the air. To the audience, the circles appeared to be connected until the act started with a burst of fireworks. The wheels then split, sending the performers in opposite directions without safety nets or harnesses. To stay on the device, the duo had to move in unison, running at up to 20 miles an hour. Vibrations were transferred from one wheel to the other, meaning each performer was affected by what the other was doing. At the top of each arc the performers were rendered weightless, while being subjected to several times the force of gravity at the bottom.
The act was set around a story line. During the first half of the circus, Wallenda's wife, Erendira, played the love interest of Nock. After intermission, Wallenda and Nock "battled" it out on the Wheel, competing for her heart. To enhance the entertainment value, they mixed jumping rope, somersaults, and leaps into the routine. In all, the Wheel performance lasted seven minutes.
Also part of the same show was a sway pole performance by Wallenda and his wife. Using poles that swayed as much as in all directions, the couple did a series of tricks that included climbing up and sliding down the poles, swinging all around, and jumping from pole to pole. In all, sixteen members of the Wallenda family were part of "Bellobration".
The double Wheel of Steel was invented by Wallenda and Nock. The two had grown up together in Sarasota and had talked about teaming up for years before coming up with the double Wheel concept, drawing up the initial plans on a tablecloth during dinner in 2005. They then spent nine months building the device in Nock's backyard workshop, and a further four months testing it and designing a performance. The greatest challenge was to find a way to split the wheels while they were still spinning. "There were a lot of back-to-the-drawing-board moments", Wallenda later recalled. Ultimately, the problem was solved via a system of piston-like pneumatic cylinders. Wallenda's uncle, Timothy Stephenson, who is an engineer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), suggested that an axle be built of custom-blended, hardened steel alloy to keep it from breaking. In the end, the device cost more than $100,000 to produce.
Record-setting bicycle ride.
On October 15, 2008, Wallenda performed on a live broadcast of "Today". The plan was to walk and then bicycle off the roof of the Prudential Center in Downtown Newark, New Jersey, across a suspended high-wire 13 and 1/2 stories (135 feet) above the ground. Starting at 8:30am, he first walked across the cable with a balancing pole. Half way through, he sat down on the wire and called the "Today" show hosts. "Where are you?" he asked, joking that he was expecting to carry one of the show's hosts across the wire on his shoulder. Sitting down on the wire is easy, he said, it is getting back up that is tricky. A few steps before completing the walk, Wallenda stopped and waved to the crowd. When he resumed, he wobbled and had to bend his knees to regain balance. "I actually slipped," he said later. "I lost focus there for a moment" because of some unexpected tape on the wire. He completed the walk in about five minutes.
Wallenda then crossed the high-wire on an ordinary bicycle with the tires and handlebars removed. Near completion, he paused, causing the bike to slide backward as it lost grip on the wire. He regained control and finished, then jumped onto the roof of Prudential Center and hugged his wife and three children. He explained in an interview: "The back wheel started to slip ... It was a little nerve-racking at the end." Five years later, he said the slip was closest he ever came to disaster. "It really shook me up", recalled. By completing the ride, Wallenda set the world record for both highest and longest bike ride on a high-wire. A representative from Guinness World Records was on hand to present him with a certificate documenting the achievement.
Walk Across America Tour.
In 2009, Wallenda took his high-wire act to ten Cedar Fair amusement parks in what was dubbed as the "Walk Across America Tour". The tour began with a walk at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City and ended at Carowinds, where Wallenda twice walked across the North Carolina-South Carolina state line on the high-wire. As part of the tour, he walked at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio from the front gate to the Eiffel Tower on August 15. Traveling at above the ground, it was the highest walk of his career at the time. He completed the walk in about 25 minutes as several thousand people watched.
On July 3, Wallenda wire walked over the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh as the headline act of the 2009 Three Rivers Regatta. He paused several times during the performance to kneel and wave to the crowd. At one point, he had to stop for a few minutes to regain his balance in the strong winds and rain. Although Wallenda's team had ordered an ungreased wire, it was covered in oil when it arrived. To compensate, Wallenda did the walk in his socks rather than in his tightrope shoes. At , the 25-minute walk was the longest of his career to that point.
In total, Wallenda completed 15 high-wire performances at 100 or more feet in the air during 2009. In 2010, he performed in his home town of Sarasota for the first time. On February 4, he walked from the roof of One Watergate Condominium to the roof of The Ritz-Carlton Hotel. The performance lasted 12 minutes and was aired on national television. From February 12–28, he anchored a version of The Flying Wallenda seven-person pyramid at Circus Sarasota.
The Bahamas.
On August 30, 2010, Wallenda performed at the Atlantis Paradise Island resort in the Bahamas. For the first part of his act, he rode a bicycle along a high-wire above the ocean. The ride set a new Guinness World Record for highest bike ride on a high-wire, nearly doubling Wallenda's own record from 2008. Following the bike ride, Wallenda tightrope walked over the resort's marine habitat filled with barracuda, piranha, and sharks. It was the longest walk of his career.
Between the morning bike ride and the late afternoon tightrope walk, Wallenda's father and safety coordinator Terry passed out from a combination of heat and stress and was rushed to the hospital. Performing without his father watching "was one of the hardest decisions I ever made in my life", Wallenda said, "but my family history and my family tradition is that the show must go on." It was the first time in his career that he performed without the assistance of his father. In addition, he had to battle rain, strong winds, and lightning in the area to complete the feats.
Wheel of Death record.
On April 28, 2011, Wallenda visited the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey for a pair of performances. In the first, he walked a tightrope inside the casino's shopping center. Performing with a balancing pole, in the air, he dropped to one knee and then onto his back during the performance. He walked both forwards and backwards before completing the journey. Afterwards, Wallenda said he had previously noted the casino's raised ceiling painted with a sky scene and said to himself "I've gotta walk there!"
Later in the day, Wallenda went outside to perform the Wheel of Death off the roof and over the side of the casino's 23rd floor. In the act, he walked inside the wheel for roughly 10 rotations, then climbed atop it where he walked and jumped rope around it. Part of the act, he performed blindfolded. The performance set a world record for the greatest height at which the Wheel had ever been performed. It was also the first time anyone had performed the act off the side of a building.
Puerto Rico.
On June 4, 2011, Wallenda completed a high-wire crossing between the two towers of the ten-story Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The performance was a recreation of the act that had killed Karl Wallenda in 1978. For the performance, Wallenda's mother, Delilah (Karl's granddaughter), joined him. The mother and son team started at opposite ends of the wire. When Delilah reached the middle of the wire, roughly the spot Karl had fallen, she sat down on the wire and Nik stepped over her before the two continued to opposite ends of the wire. At one point during the performance, Nik knelt down on the wire and blew a kiss in honor of his great-grandfather's memory.
After the feat, Wallenda said he was "not scared at all," but admitted that the circumstances of Karl's death had haunted him for years. "This has been a dream of mine to recreate this walk", he explained. "To be able to walk in his exact footsteps is an extremely huge honor, and I did this for him as much as I did it for my family to get some closure." He also called the walk the biggest and most emotional moment of his career to that point. "I can't even put it into words. It was so emotional", he said a week later.
Hanging from a helicopter.
On June 10, 2011, Wallenda performed while hanging from a helicopter above Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri. First he hung from a trapeze with two arms, then one arm, then his legs, and finally by his teeth. In so doing, Wallenda set his sixth world record. He called it his most difficult feat to date, and remarked that training "was very difficult. It was very painful. I had neck problems for months afterwards".
For the next couple months, Wallenda performed daily shows at Silver Dollar City with his family. The highlight of the show was a three-person "Chair Pyramid" on the high-wire. Wallenda and Jonah Finkelstein rode bicycles across the wire while Delilah Wallenda sat in a chair atop a balance bar they carried. In the middle of the performance, Wallenda would purposely act like he was losing control and move the balance bar erratically to heighten the drama. He would then shout "Watch it, Mom!" before regaining control. Acting off balance was the hardest part of the act, according to Wallenda.
Niagara Falls crossing.
On February 15, 2012, Nik Wallenda received official approval from Ontario's Niagara Parks Commission (NPC) to walk a tightrope across Niagara Falls, a dream he had had since he was a child. The plan called for crossing the Niagara River and its deep gorge from the American side at Goat Island or at the smaller Luna Island, and making his way across the river to land at the Canadian side near the site of Table Rock. The American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls would be behind him and to his right, while the Canadian Falls would be on his immediate left and behind.
The approval came after nearly two years of lobbying governments in both the United States and Canada. In October 2010, Wallenda was approached by Roger Trevino, the executive vice president of Niagara Falls Redevelopment, at an amusement trade show. Trevino later recalled: "I went up to Wallenda and said ‘Have you ever thought about walking across the falls?’ and he said, ‘ever since I was a little kid,’ and then he asked about the steps involved." Wallenda later remarked "I believe people are brought into my life for a reason... I take everyone seriously because you just never know you are talking to". Trevino next contacted New York State Senator George Maziarz. After Maziarz met Wallenda, he went to work at drafting a bill granting Wallenda a one-time exemption to the state's anti-stunting laws. Dennis H. Gabryszak co-sponsored the bill, and it passed the State Senate and Assembly nearly unanimously. The bill was signed into law by governor Andrew Cuomo on September 23, 2011.
On the Canadian side, things went less smoothly. In June 2011, public statements by NPC board members made it clear that they were opposed to Wallenda's plan. After an October meeting with Wallenda, the twelve-person board voted on December 7 to maintain their anti-stunting rules. NPC officials, led by chair Janice Thomson, feared Wallenda's plan could bring back the days when amateur daredevils routinely got themselves injured or killed at the Falls, and also believed it would cheapen the area's natural beauty. "It's sensationalism, and that's not what the falls is supposed to be about," said Thomson. In response, Wallenda funded an economic impact survey conducted by Enigma Research. The results suggested direct revenue potential of $20.5 million for the city, with up to $122 million of "legacy effects" over the next five years. The survey also predicted worldwide viewership of 460 million people. Wallenda further promised to fund all the necessary safety-contingencies and to leave no footprint on the environment. Seeing the economic benefits, Ontario Minister of Tourism Michael Chan convinced the NPC to take a second look. On February 15, 2012, the commission voted unanimously to give Wallenda's plan the go ahead, provided that he paid rigging and commission costs of C$105,000. Wallenda described the legal battle as the biggest challenge of his career and "probably more remarkable" than the walk itself. He attributed the eventual success to divine intervention. "God's hand is involved in every step of my life," he explained. "I believe doors were opened for me that weren't opened for others". Six previous high-profile wire walkers had failed in their attempts to gain approval to walk the Falls since 1971.
In preparation for the event, municipal authorities on both sides of the border met to discuss the long-term economic impact of the event, and how to capitalize efficiently on the large number of tourists expected at the Falls when it was held. The event was expected to bring in millions of dollars in tourist revenue on both sides of the border. The Niagara Parks Commission has stated it will be at least twenty years before another major stunt is approved.
Wallenda hopes that eventually he can make the Niagara Falls region a prominent aspect of his business. "I do plan on spending a lot of time in this community," he told local reporters months before his historic walk. "This isn't a one-off event where I'll show up and do an event and be gone. I would like to make this my second home and bring a full-time show here that I would be performing throughout the season along with all my family members as well."
The Discovery Channel had Wallenda under contract and negotiated with several of the major television networks for broadcast rights. On May 11, 2012, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Lincoln Square Productions announced they had secured worldwide broadcasting rights for the event. Josh Elliott and Hannah Storm were chosen to host the coverage. In Canada, CTV's coverage of the event, although a direct feed from ABC, invoked simultaneous substitution over ABC network broadcasts in some parts of Canada.
On his final performance before heading to Niagara for training, Wallenda walked above Baltimore's Inner Harbor. According to Wallenda, it was the first time anyone had attached a high-wire to a barge; he remarked that the configuration made the walk "a little more unstable" than normal. Near the end of the journey, he had a significant slip, but managed to regain his balance quickly. He called the slip "a wake-up call" for Niagara. "My friend was up in the basket and I started talking to him, and it was just enough of a distraction", he explained. "The wire kind of moved a little bit and I just misstepped. It's why I've trained for so long: you stay on the wire. Your heart jumps up into your throat and two seconds later, you're fine." The May 9 event was sponsored by Ripley's Believe It or Not which was opening a museum on the harbor. When it opened it June, a feature exhibit allowed visitors to walk on a piece of the wire Wallenda had used in Baltimore.
To prepare for the Niagara event, Wallenda practiced in the parking lot of Seneca Niagara Casino for eleven straight days. He had fire trucks spray him with water and brought in a high-powered fan to try to simulate the conditions he would face over Niagara Falls. Practices were open to the public. Wallenda's safety coordinator and father, Terry Troffer, said the training was primarily mental. "This is a mental game. It's convincing himself that ... it's just a different location," Troffer explained.
Eleven days before the scheduled walk date, Wallenda faced a new challenge. Official permits had not yet been granted in New York and park officials were threatening to cancel the event over payment issues. Wallenda's managers claimed to be on schedule with the US$225,000 the state was charging him. The park commission claimed that Wallenda's failure to sign the necessary paperwork was holding things up. To avoid negative publicity, Wallenda's manager, David Simone, withdrew $75,000 from his personal account to foot the bill. Permits were issued the next day. However, two days before the event, New York parks threatened to pull the permits as Wallenda's team still owed over $10,000. According to Wallenda, "the U.S. side was just nasty to deal with toward the end. They were accusing us of lying and saying we weren't fulfilling the contract." However, he said the local officials were great to work with, blaming higher-ups in Albany for the problems. Maziarz acknowledged there were "some tense moments", but said there was never any chance of the event not happening. Ultimately, a wire transfer by ABC resolved the issue. No similar issues arose on the Canadian side.
On the day of the walk, June 15, 2012, crowds estimated in the tens of thousands gathered on the American side of the falls. On the Canadian side, the crowd was estimated at 120,000 people. Due to the location, the wire could not use supports and had to be custom made. As a result, the wire was able to sway significantly in the breeze, making the crossing more difficult than it would have otherwise been. It was the first time in Wallenda's career that he performed without guy wire stabilizers. The wire was two inches (five centimeters) in diameter, significantly wider than the 5/8ths of an inch wire Wallenda typically uses, and weighed roughly 8.5 tons (7,700 kg). The extra width was necessary to make the cable strong enough to withstand the tension required. Getting it across the Falls was a major technological challenge. On June 12, a helicopter flew a yellow rope across the canyon. The rope was attached to the steel high-wire and a giant winch was used to slowly pull the wire across as the crew slowly increased tension to support the increasing weight. Weighted pendulums were attached every to keep the wire from twisting.
To make the walk accessible to viewers worldwide, it was held after dark, with the first step coming at 10:16 p.m. local time (02:16 June 16 UTC). The time was also advantageous to Wallenda, as half of the volume of water going over the Falls is diverted for power generation purposes after dusk. Wallenda wore a microphone for the event which allowed Troffer to talk with him, while the public listened in, throughout the walk.
Wallenda's chosen path took him across the widest part of the falls. He slowly inched his way across the slippery wire, praying and praising Jesus Christ as he went. As he took his first steps over the water, walking on a downward slope, he told reporters, "It's a beautiful view ... A dream in the making." Later he described the first step over the falls as the toughest part of his journey. "Mentally, your mind goes, 'What are you doing?'" he recalled. When he reached the midpoint, he was roughly lower than where he started due to the sag of the wire. The second half of the walk brought him uphill, back to the same elevation at which he began.
Wallenda did not falter or totter in the slightest during his walk, nor did he stop to do any extra tricks during the walk (as he often does). Talking to ABC reporters live, as he entered the final phase of the trip he admitted, "I'm drained ... My hands are going numb. I feel like I'm getting weak." Later he said, "my forearm just started to cramp worse than it ever has been before", attributing it the stress of the day. Near the end, he stopped, got down on one knee, and blew a kiss to the crowd. He got up, pumped his fist, and ran the final few steps. He completed the crossing at 10:41 p.m. EDT, 25 minutes after he started. In so doing, Wallenda became the first person to cross directly over Niagara Falls on a high-wire. In the 1800s, a few tightrope walkers had crossed over the Niagara Gorge down river, but none had ever crossed directly over the Falls. He also set the world record for longest walk over a waterfall. Prior to Wallenda, the last person to cross the river on tightrope was James Hardy in 1896. According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history. He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it to Canadian border guards waiting for him upon his arrival on the Canadian side of the falls.
ABC required Wallenda to wear a safety harness for the walk. After the decision was made in mid-May, a spokesperson for ABC explained: "We had always made clear from the beginning that significant safety precautions would need to be taken. This is the outcome of that." Wallenda was not happy about the decision, stating "It's disheartening—I wanted to do it without anything." The Niagara Parks Commission indicated it was unaware of such a requirement when they were considering approval. During the walk, Wallenda told his dad that he felt "like a jackass" wearing the harness. Many observers predicted he would remove the harness partway through the walk, but ultimately he did not do so. Before the crossing, Wallenda had promised that he only would remove the harness if it became a hazard during the walk. "When I first found out about it, there was no doubt in my mind I was going to take it off", he later said. "But as event got closer and closer, I realized I had to honor my word. I've always said I'm a man of integrity." He also acknowledged that removing the harness would have created contractual problems with ABC. "The way a TV network works, if something goes wrong, they fire people," he said. "If I would have dropped that tether, four people would have been fired because I'm too selfish to care or because it's all about me." In addition to the harness, Wallenda wore a waterproof track suit and shoes custom made by his mother for the walk. Part moccasin, part ballet shoe, the shoes were designed to get a good grip when wet.
Project costs were between US$1.2 and $1.3 million, necessitating ABC's financial support (and with it, their demand of a safety harness). "I'd dare say that never in the history of the circus industry has there been one event that costs this much," said Wallenda. The production was a serious financial strain on Wallenda. "It's been a tough situation all around", he said a week before the event, blaming the lingering fight over the safety harness for inhibiting sponsorship deals. When production costs ran over the original estimate of $1 million, he appealed to the public for help using the fundraising website Indiegogo. He eventually met his goal of $50,000. Additionally, Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati asked local businesses to chip in, saying he hoped to raise $250,000. Ultimately, he helped generate about $200,000 of support from local business associations. The main causes of the overrun were the need to produce two custom cables – one for the performance and a shorter one for practice – and the need to hire a new helicopter company to set up the cable at the last minute, after the original one discovered they did not hold the necessary licenses. After the event, Wallenda said he had probably lost money on the event; however, he added, it was "clearly worth it" in the long term. With all but one bill accounted for, Wallenda said he lost less than $50,000 on the event. The fundraising, combined with several contractors lowering their bills, helped him get close to budget. "I think people still have the impression that Nik Wallenda is going to walk away from this thing making millions of dollars, but that's not the case," he commented.
After completing the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected. "That mist was thick. It was hard to see at times. The wind was wild. It'd come at me one way and hit me from the front, and hit me from the back." Weather instruments showed gusts up to 14 mph during the walk. Wallenda further remarked that the turbulent waters below made it difficult for him to see the wire. Before the walk, Jay Cochrane, a veteran wire walker who had unsuccessfully petitioned to walk Horseshoe Falls for 30 years, said of the local weather "Unpredictable is a mild word. It is unforgiving ... Falls can spray mist anywhere from 380 to 590 feet in the air. I've seen it, I've measured it." He added that walking Horseshoe Falls was an opportunity "like none other in history." Long-time circus performer, Jackie LeClaire, remarked "aerialists always try to calculate risk. Nik couldn't do that because this walk had never been done before." Local historian, Paul Gromosiak, who has researched daredevil activity in the Niagara region for his books, said Wallenda's proximity to the falls made his act far more dangerous than any prior act.
After talking briefly with reporters, Wallenda called his grandmother, who reportedly had been too frightened to watch the walk, in order to let her know he made it safely. In a news conference shortly thereafter, Wallenda remarked "I feel like I'm on cloud nine right now ... The impossible is not quite the impossible if you set your mind to it." He credited a combination of prayer, concentration, and preparation for his success.
On June 16, Engima Research estimated that one billion people had seen or heard about Wallenda's walk, up from an estimate of 410 million prior to the event. Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati declared that "the stars aligned perfectly" allowing the event hit its "full potential." Media representatives from Australia, China, France, Germany, Great Britain, Korea, and the Middle East were on hand to cover the event. Overnight Nielsen Ratings indicated that the two-hour special was the most watched television broadcast in the United States for the night. Initial estimates put the show at a peak rating of 7.7, representing almost 13 million viewers during the last half hour of the program. When final numbers were released, the viewership number was upped to 13.3 million for the final half hour, and an average of 10.3 million for the entire two-hour special. Viewership peaked at around 16 million.
It was ABC's highest rated Friday night program since November 2007, and the highest non-sports summertime program on any of the major networks in six years. The program, together with the NBA finals, helped ABC beat their nearest competitor by 36% in total viewers and 88% in the important 18-49 demographic for the week. In Buffalo, New York the show peaked at a 48.5 rating/67 share for the last half hour, meaning two out of every three TVs in the area where watching the event. The rating possibly represented the highest summertime viewership for any program in history there. In Canada, the program averaged 3.9 million viewers, with viewership peaking as the walk ended with 6.8 million watching. The program set a new summertime record for most watched non-sports special. Viewership was highest in Toronto where the production brought in a 20.8 rating/50.4 share, meaning more than half of the city's television were tuned in.
The morning after walking Niagara Falls, Wallenda drove his family to the airport so they could rejoin the Fabulous Wallendas Famous Family Circus in Branson, Missouri. Later on June 16, Niagara Falls, New York, mayor Paul A. Dyster presented Wallenda with the key to the city. He also said that the city may erect a permanent memorial on Goat Island to document Wallenda's feat. Dyster had initially been skeptical of the event, but was won over by Wallenda's personality. "The way he's been conducting himself since he's been in Niagara Falls has won him a lot of friends," Dyster explained. On the Canadian side, Diodati said he would like to erect a statue of Wallenda at Table Rock with a green screen photo booth to allow visitors to "participate" in the historic walk. On June 27, Janice Thomson said plans were in the works to install plaques near Table Rock and on White Water Walk. Previously, she described the event as a complete success, remarking that it had showcased the river's natural beauty to an international audience.
On July 20, it was revealed that Niagara Falls, New York, was attempting to bill Wallenda an additional $25,000 for police and fireman overtime. City officials cited the state law passed to allow the walk, which read "Mr. Wallenda shall pay ... reasonable costs associated with security or law enforcement stemming from this activity". Dyster said to forgive the alleged debt would amount to "a gift of public funds". Wallenda called the request "disgusting and sad," saying "This was a great thing for the area ... gave me a key to the city, and now they want to ask for more money?" He noted that the city staged a downtown festival to take advantage of the crowds, and said he should not have to pay the security costs related to the festival. His lawyer, John P. Bartolomei, said Wallenda was only responsible for money spent by the city in the park itself, which had already been more than paid. He also noted that Wallenda's contract was with the state parks commission, not the city itself. Senator Maziarz called the city's position "shortsighted" and accused Dyster of being "disingenuous". He noted that Dyster had been against the walk from the beginning and that the city had never tried to bill other entertainers for costs associated with their acts. On July 24, the city council passed a resolution encouraging Dyster to stop pursuing the alleged debt by a 4-1 margin. Dyster responded by stating he was legally obligated to continue his efforts, remarking "Since the council didn't establish the fee I'm not sure if the council can forgive it". He did, however, say he would ask the state comptroller for second opinion.
On the Canadian side, Diodati and the NPC said Wallenda had fulfilled all financial obligations. Diodati added that he was not billing Wallenda for $10,000 of unbudgeted costs incurred by the city. "We're treating this event as an investment, not as an expense. We're quite happy with the way this turned out", he said. Wallenda says that the experience has made him less likely to stage a permanent attraction on the American side of the falls.
According to "The Buffalo News" Wallenda was seen picking up cigarette butts and other trash long after most of the media had left. He grabbed a shovel and helped fill in the hole left by apparatus. "It's just something that has to be done," he said. "I'm not scared of working." "We take great pride in being a zero-impact operation", he said prior to the event. A parks official said the area was clean and back to normal by 3 p.m. the day after the walk. Wallenda reiterated that he hopes to develop a lasting presence in Niagara Falls. "There will always be a piece of my heart in Niagara Falls," he remarked. "I do see a future here and hope to have a show in this area and hope to spend more time here." He did, however, rule out a repeat performance saying, "No. That's not really my thing. I've done it. It's done."
Research released by Niagara University's Hospitality Training and Research Center on July 1, suggested that Wallenda's walk had brought in $3.3 million of revenue for the city of Niagara Falls, New York. The research indicated that 38,000 people gathered on the American side of the falls to watch the act, 41% of which were from out of town. Among the out-of-town visitors, 52% came specifically to see Wallenda. Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation reported that hotel bookings and related business was up 30% in the two weeks after the walk. Website traffic and sales of multiple attraction passes experienced similar increases. Data released by Smith Travel Research indicated that June hotel occupancy in Niagara Falls, New York, rose from 76.5 percent in 2011 to 81.6 percent in 2012.
On the Canadian side, no official effort was made to calculate the economic impact, although Enigma Research said the event "might have done better" than the $21.5 million the company estimated before the event. Wallenda's feat has also been credited with creating a "surge of interest in circus and circus arts across the world".
"Nik Wallenda: Beyond Niagara".
A reality show, originally titled "Danger By Design", following Wallenda and his family premiered on The Science Channel on June 18, 2012. The show's pilot had previously aired in 2010 under the title "Life on a Wire", before Discovery decided to hold the show until after the Niagara Falls walk. The pilot episode, which tracked Wallenda's high-wire walk and bicycle ride in The Bahamas, was described as "a sometimes painfully candid look at the creative tensions — and the strong familial bond — between Wallenda and his dad, Terry Troffer, who got so stressed out during preparations for that stunt he wound up in the hospital" by the "Sarasota Herald-Tribune". Later episodes showcased Wallenda hanging from a helicopter by his teeth, preparing for the Wheel of Death in Atlantic City, blowing himself up in a box, and retracing the steps of Karl Wallenda's fatal last act in Puerto Rico. The show focused on the science and engineering that go into Wallenda's acts.
After two episodes had aired, the show was renamed "Nik Wallenda: Beyond Niagara". The next week, on July 2, it was put "on hold" by The Science Channel. Wallenda said the decision was "not that surprising" given the limited marketing efforts and multiple name changes. The Science Channel declined to comment on the decision.
After Niagara.
On June 20, 2012 Wallenda rejoined his family in Branson. He was greeted by a parade in his honor at the Silver Dollar theme park. For Wallenda, it was back to business as usual. "I never want to get complacent", he said in a press release. "I could get hurt just as easily on a wire here as walking over Niagara Falls."
On August 9, Wallenda conducted a tightrope walk across the Atlantic City beach from Sovereign Avenue to the Tropicana Resort, roughly in the air. According to him, the walk was a unique challenge due to potentially dangerous ocean winds. Additionally, Wallenda was surprised by the large amount of sand that stuck to the wire and considered cancelling as a result. "I learned a lesson," he remarked. "There was a lot of sand on the cable and it actually made it a little bit slippery, definitely eerie at the beginning". Ultimately, he completed the half-hour walk without any visible difficulty. Large crowds were reported for the public event, with attendance estimates ranging from 100,000 to 150,000. Wallenda believes that the feat marked the first time that a wire walker attempted such a walk on any beach.
The beach walk was done to promote Wallenda's new show, "Beyond the Falls: Nik Wallenda and the Wallenda Family Experience", which premiered at the Tropicana Resort on August 12. The show featured Nik, wife Erendira, mother Delilah, cousin Blake, and about a dozen other performers in a variety of circus acts including contortion, quick-change artistry, and juggling. Michael Richter served as the lead clown and the show ended with the Wallendas doing a bicycle pyramid on the wire. Amy Rosenberg of the "Philadelphia Inquirer" described the show as "an old fashion vaudeville variety act" and remarked "I dug the show and so did all the little kids around me".
"Balance".
On June 4, 2013, Wallenda's memoir, "Balance: A Story of Faith, Family, and Life on the Line", was published by FaithWorks. Ghost written by David Ritz, the book details his family history, Christian faith, and his circus career. Ritz got in touch with Wallenda after his Niagara walk to pitch the idea. He then spent several months following Wallenda around and asking questions. Erendira, who has an excellent memory, supplied much of the dialogue.
"Balance" weaves in themes of faith throughout, as it chronicles Wallenda's childhood, adolescence, and adult career, with particular emphasis on the ups and down of his marriage and personal life. It concludes with the Niagara Falls crossing. "One of the challenges of writing a book", Wallenda commented, "is there's things you probably don't want people to know about you ... It was very emotional telling these stories at times ... It is a challenge to reveal your life story."
Reviewer John Law remarked, "Wallenda is really juggling two books with Balance – one about his tireless belief in God's plan, and the stuff readers actually want to know: The hardships, the drama, the thrill of life on a wire." He said the book felt "rushed", likely in an attempt to get it out before Wallenda's crossing of the Grand Canyon, but said it is "worth it for the chapter on the Falls".
Canyon walk.
On June 23, 2013, Wallenda highwire walked across the Little Colorado River Gorge in Navajo territory outside Grand Canyon National Park's borders about 40 miles east of the main tourist facilities. The event, billed as a "Grand Canyon crossing" and titled "Skywire Live with Nik Wallenda", aired live worldwide on the Discovery Channel with a 10-second delay. Opinions varied on whether the event was truly a walk across the Grand Canyon. The Reuters news agency described the location as simply "the Grand Canyon", while the Associated Press described it as a "gorge near the Grand Canyon." According to the United States Geological Survey, the Grand Canyon geological area includes the Little Colorado River Gorge. 
Wallenda originally obtained permits to walk across the canyon in 2008, and planned to make the trip as early as 2009. However, the walk was delayed due to substantial logistical hurdles. When the opportunity to cross Niagara Falls arose, the Grand Canyon walk was put on hold. Shortly after crossing Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he would try to make the Grand Canyon crossing "within a year". In August 2012, he said that he was "98 percent" certain that the walk would take place in May or June of 2013 and said he would get "something in writing" that no safety harness would be required for the walk. On March 18, 2013, Wallenda announced that he had come to terms with The Discovery Channel for television rights. 
According to Wallenda, "There's a lot of updrafts and downdrafts, and the winds are hard to predict the Canyon". To prepare for the winds, Wallenda walked a wire twice daily along the banks of a Sarasota river with fans watching. He used wind machines to simulate wind gusts up to and practiced during the heavy rain of Tropical Storm Andrea. Wallenda said it was "hard to prepare for updrafts ... when it comes down to Mother Nature, we’re not in control." 
At , the walk was the highest of Wallenda's career, about seven times as high as the Niagara crossing. He covered a distance of approximately in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, using a wire. He carried a balancing pole weighing . 
As the walk began, Wallenda realized the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. He spat on his hands and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying "Thank you, Jesus." Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge.
After the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected and that "it took every bit of me to stay focused". He said that dust had accumulated in his contacts and called the walk unusually stressful. However, he called the view breathtaking, and said the opportunity "was a dream come true." "Skywire Live" drew an average of 10.7 million viewers in the United States, making it the highest rated program of the night. During the walk itself, viewership increased to 13 million. It became the highest rated live program in Discovery's history and won 71% of TV-related social media usage for the day.
Future plans.
During a live interview on "Skywire Live", Wallenda said for his next feat he would like to walk between the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building in New York City. The following day the New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the city would not grant permission for a stunt like that. In the long run, his goal is to achieve global recognition and celebrity. "I've had a vision for my name since I was very young, that I was going to take it to the top of my industry", he says. His wirewalking "wishlist" includes traversing the Bosphorus continental divide in Turkey and Inca ruins at Macchu Picchu. He would like to do an event with the Eiffel Tower and Egypt's pyramids. "There's a lot of expectations on my end", he says, adding that he wants to " the circus". "Whenever we're someplace unique or different," says Erendira, "he's always looking around – 'Oh, I could string a wire from here to there and walk there.'"
Personal life.
In 1999, Wallenda proposed to his future wife Erendira (née Vasquez) on a wire high during a performance in Montreal, Quebec. Having just performed a seven-man pyramid act with his family, he stayed on the platform while the family descended. He walked to the middle of the wire and got down on one knee, proposing to Erendira in front of 25,000 people. A week later, they were married. "I don’t know if either of us could be married to someone who didn’t perform," says Erendira. "I can’t see either of us ever being happy sitting behind a desk."
Wallenda credits God for his success, saying that what he does on the high-wire is a gift from God. He grew up in a "a Bible-believing, God-fearing family" and describes himself as a "born-again Christian". Faith is "the most important part of my life," he says. According to family friend Michael Mascitto, "When he started doing some of these bigger stunts, he realized that he was developing a platform, or rather God was giving him a platform, to use his abilities for God’s glory". Mascitto says Wallenda's faith has been strengthened as his profile grew. "He truly believes it’s because God has given him this platform for a reason — to glorify Him ... Him with a capital H."
Before every wire walk, Wallenda joins his family in prayer and he always wears a cross as he performs. He remarks, "The Bible says pray without ceasing and I'm always praying." He denies that his stunts "test" God. "To test God would be to never train, never practice, and then to walk across the Grand Canyon; or to jump off a building, or throw myself in front of a truck," he says. Wallenda says he tries to live "an upright life" and be a good example. Despite his success, Wallenda wants people to think of him as just a regular guy. "I want people to like me, just for who I am," he says. "What you get is a regular person. I want people to relate to me." Friends described him as a lighthearted guy who is always cracking jokes.
Wallenda describes himself as a challenge-driven person. "Don't tell me, 'It can't be done,' because I'll find a way to do it", he says. "My whole thing", he says, "is I don't want to just break records. I want to set myself apart from any record that's been done before." Wallenda lives by the mantra "Never Give Up". He believes that through hard work, one can achieve anything they desire. "I think are what life is about", he remarks. "We all go through challenges. But once we get through them, we look back and say look how much our lives have changed by going through that challenge." 
Wallenda and his wife own and operate Wallendas Inc. They have three children: Yanni, aged 15, Amadaos, 12, and Evita, 10. The children are free to choose their own professions, Wallenda says. Evita is said to be the most interested in following in her father's footsteps. "In the back yard we have a wire that's two feet off the ground and that's what's fun for my daughter. Kids want to do what their parents do," Wallenda remarks. Erendira and the children are always nearby; the six days they were separated from Nik while he prepared for Niagara Falls was the longest separation in nine years.

Ralph Levett

Rev. Ralph Levett (1600 – c. 1660) was an Anglican minister who served as domestic chaplain to an aristocratic English family from Lincolnshire with Puritan sympathies, who subsequently installed him as rector of the local parish. A graduate of Christ's College, Cambridge, where he became a protégé of the prominent Puritan minister John Cotton, Levett later married the sister of the wife of his friend Rev. John Wheelwright, another well-known early Puritan settler of New England.
Biography.
Early life.
Ralph Levett was born in 1600 in High Melton, South Yorkshire to an old Yorkshire family previously seated at Normanton and Hooton Levitt. His father, Thomas Levett, was of middling rank in the local gentry, not owning the manor at High Melton, but identified as 'gent.' in local records. Ralph Levett's mother was Elizabeth Mirfin of a family who owned the manor of Thurcroft.
Levett enrolled at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1617, where he took his B.A. and M.A. degrees, and was ordained in 1624, when he was named a deacon at York. Following his ordination, Levett spent time in the Boston, Lincolnshire, household of Rev. John Cotton, a leading Puritan of his day. The practice of taking in postgraduate students for training in a Puritan rector's household was a well-established one, and Cotton had many such Cambridge acolytes, who came to learn the ways of carrying on a Puritan ministry.
Ashby cum Fenby.
Following his time in Cotton's household, Levett took up his post as private chaplain with the household of Sir William Wray in Ashby cum Fenby, Lincolnshire. Wray was the son of Sir Christopher Wray, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and a wealthy politician, having enriched himself with profits from the Royal mint. Sir Christopher Wray was lord of several manors in Yorkshire, as well as four others, including Grainsby, in Lincolnshire. His son Sir William, (1555–1617) was created baronet, and was the father of two sons: Sir John Wray and, by his second wife Frances, daughter of Sir William Drury of Hawstead, Suffolk, Sir Christopher Wray (1601–1646). 
Although originally from Yorkshire, Levett apparently decided to remain in Lincolnshire. His post within the Wray family household, known as Puritan sympathizers, shielded Levett to some degree from the persecution by Archbishop William Laud of clergymen with Puritan sympathies. In 1636, by contrast, Levett's friend Wheelwright, whom he apparently knew at Cambridge, was driven from his post at Bilsby by the ecclesiastical authorities, and departed for the Massachusetts Bay Colony.)
Still, the rigors of ministering to an aristocratic, if Puritan-inclined household, meant that Levett sometimes wrote to his former mentor Cotton for advice on handling tricky situations. In 1627 the novice Levett wrote Cotton, inquiring how to pray appropriately for his patroness when she was in the congregation, and Levett asked for particular guidance on dealing with entertainments he witnessed at Christmastime, including "cardinge" (card playing) as well as "mixt dancinge." Valentine's Day caught Levett unawares when he was approached by the household's "2. young Ladyes" and asked to draw a name from a hat. 
"His Puritan principles," writes Sargent Bush in his "The Correspondence of John Cotton", "were clearly being challenged as he considered what was an appropriate response for him as a minister of God on the one hand and an employee of the family on the other. So he looked to his mentor for advice."
In Cotton's responses, one senses the subtle nuances required of some Puritan thinkers, as well as the collegial nature of the early Puritan ministerial cadre. Cotton gave Levett advice on how to pray for his patroness without appearing to flatter her, and he warned Levett against 'carding' and drawing names at Valentine's as they were 'lotteries.' Interestingly, Cotton had no problem with dancing, except "lasciuious dauncinge to wanton dittyes & in amorous gestures & wanton dalliances especially after great feasts."
In 1632, five years after Levett's letter to Cotton, Lincolnshire records show the marriage of "Mr. Ralfe Levit and Anne Hutchinson" in Bilsby, the parish of Rev. John Wheelwright and not far from Ashby cum Fenby. Anne Hutchinson was the daughter of Edward Hutchinson of Alford, and the sister of Mary Hutchinson, Wheelwright's second wife. Mary Hutchinson, John Wheelwright's wife, was the sister-in-law of her brother William Hutchinson's wife, another Anne Hutchinson, who later became prominent in the Massachusetts Antinomian controversy.
Grainsby.
But unlike his Puritan friends, Levett elected to remain in England. He left his post as domestic chaplain to the Wray family for the rector's job in a manor owned by his Wray patrons. In 1633 he began signing the transcripts at the church at Grainsby as 'Radulphus Levet, rector.' On 3 April 1635, when the previous rector Thomas Humphrey was buried, 'Ralph Levitt, M.A.' was presented to the rectory of Grainsby by Frances, widow of Sir William Wray. Perhaps the Wray family's endorsement provided Levett some measure of protection, or his brother John's position as Chancellor and Commissary to the Archbishop of York helped shield him from persecution. 
Levett apparently held the living of the tiny village of Grainsby until at least 1649, when he signed the transcripts as 'R. Levet, rector.' His son Francis graduated at Queens' College, Cambridge, also became a minister, and was rector of Little Carlton, Lincolnshire, from 1662 until 1711. (When the emigrant Rev. John Wheelwright finally disposed of the last of his Lincolnshire property in 1677, Massachusetts records attest that it was "purchased of Francis Levett, gentleman," likely the son of his old friend Ralph Levett.)
Family.
Ralph Levett's two brothers were both prominent Oxford-educated lawyers. His brother Thomas Levett Thomas Levett was well known as an antiquarian, and his disposal of monastic charters descended in the Levett family to Roger Dodsworth for publication was an important event in Yorkshire historical circles. Another brother, Peter Levett, also graduated from Christ's College, Cambridge, and became a Yorkshire vicar, successively at Cantley, South Yorkshire, and Boynton, East Riding of Yorkshire.

Cliodynamics

Cliodynamics (etymologically from Clio, one of the nine muses (that of history), and dynamics (the study of temporally varying processes) is a multidisciplinary area of research focused at mathematical modeling of historical dynamics.
Origins.
The term was originally coined by Peter Turchin in 2003, and can be traced to the work of such figures as Ibn Khaldun, Jack Goldstone, Sergey Kapitsa, Randall Collins, Peter Turchin, John Komlos, Sergey Nefedov and Andrey Korotayev.
Mathematical modeling of historical dynamics.
Many historical processes are dynamic (a dynamic process is one that changes with time). Populations increase and decline, economies expand and contract, while states grow and collapse. A very common approach, which has proved its worth in innumerable applications (particularly, but not exclusively, in the natural sciences), consists of taking a holistic phenomenon and mentally splitting it up into separate parts that are assumed to interact with each other. This is the dynamical systems approach, because the whole phenomenon is represented as a system consisting of several interacting elements (or subsystems). In the dynamical systems approach, one must describe mathematically how different subsystems interact with each other. This mathematical description is the model of the system, and one can use a variety of methods to study the dynamics predicted by the model, as well as attempt to test the model by comparing its predictions with the observed dynamics. This is the approach that the cliodynamics suggests to apply to the study of historical dynamics.
Isaac Asimov employed a fictional version of this discipline, called psychohistory, as a major plot device in his Foundation series of science fiction novels.
Cliodynamics practitioners attempt to come to with mathematical models of history to explain “big history” – things like the rise of empires, social discontent, civil wars, and state collapse.
Achievements.
As of 2012 the main achievements in Cliodynamics are:
Cliodynamics: The Journal of Theoretical and Mathematical History.
"Cliodynamics: The Journal of Theoretical and Mathematical History" is a peer-reviewed web-based (free-access) journal that publishes both empirical and modeling articles. The first issue was published in November 2010.

Department of Dakota

A subdivision of the Division of the Missouri, the Department of Dakota was established by the United States Army on August 11, 1866 to encompass all military activities and forts within Minnesota, Dakota Territory and Montana Territory. The Department of Dakota was initially headquartered at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, and then moved to St.Paul in March 1867. The department was discontinued in 1911.

Voids in mineral aggregate

Voids in Mineral Aggregate or VMA is the intergranular space occupied by asphalt and air in a compacted asphalt mixture. In a component diagram, it is the sum of the volume of air and the volume of effective asphalt. The volume of absorbed asphalt is not considered to be a part of VMA because it is part of the pore structure of the mineral aggregate.
VMA= Veffective asphalt + Vair voids

Ahuvah Gray

Ahuva Gray (née Delores Gray) is a Jewish convert from Baptism. Born to a working-class family, she worked for 23 years as a flight attendant.
Ahuva Gray began to doubt Christianity when she found what she believed were discrepancies in the New Testament. This belief began a process of searching for a renewed faith. Eventually she found Judaism and converted to Orthodox Judaism. As she began studying the Jewish texts, she believed that the Torah made the most sense to her. In 1996, she gave up her position as a Christian minister and become an Orthodox Jew. She has written a book about this journey entitled "My Sister, the Jew".
She currently lives in Bayit VeGan, Jerusalem.

British–Creole intervention in the Sierra Leone hinterland in the 19th century

Sierra Leone assumed its present large geographical size only in 1896. Prior to that, it was only a small colony encompassing roughly the 30-km-long peninsula on which Freetown is located. Initially, the British and Creoles (freed slaves and their descendents) of the Freetown colony had only a very limited involvement in the affairs of the African kingdoms around them; such as it was, it consisted mostly of trading and missionary activity. Over the course of the 19th century this involvement gradually increased. The colonial government was, in particular, interested in fostering trade as this provided it with its main source of revenue, in the form of customs duties and other taxes. This inevitably drew it into engagement with the African kingdoms, mainly by making treaties with the kingdoms or sending military expeditions against them.
The treaties usually committed an African chief to protect merchants and maintain peaceful relations with his neighbours so that trade would not be disturbed; in return, the British would pay him a gift or annual stipend. The military expeditions were against chiefs who acted detrimentally to the colony's business interests by evicting traders, by restricting trade, or by warring with neighbours. After the Slave Trade Act 1807 abolition, the Government also began pressing the chiefs, by treaty or force, to refrain from slaving. Since the inter-chiefdom wars were mostly slave-procuring wars, or otherwise intimately connected with slave trading, suppression of the slave trade and promotion of the "legitimate" trade in other produce were closely related — a reduction in inter-chiefdom war being a key to both.
To the commercial and anti slave-trade motives behind the British state's incursions into the Sierra Leone hinterland can be added two others: the personal ambition of military officers posted to Sierra Leone who needed battle victories to enhance their reputations; and British feelings of cultural superiority: it was assumed that Europeanising natives was a proper and upright activity.
List of interventions.
This article lists some of the interventions into the Sierra Leone hinterland in the 19th century.
Protectorate.
In August 1896, the British declared the entire hinterland area a "Protectorate" and placed it under their administration. In 1898, the Sierra Leone chiefs sought to free themselves of British control in a rebellion called the Hut Tax war. It was the last large armed confrontation between British and Africans in Sierra Leone. The Africans' defeat ushered in the country's modern colonial period, which lasted until political independence in 1961.

Wild Strawberries Movement

The Wild Strawberries Movement () is a protest movement in Taiwan begun on November 6, 2008 after the visit of the People's Republic of China's ARATS chairman Chen Yunlin to the island. Police actions on protests aimed at Chen suppressed the display of Taiwan's national flag and the playing of Taiwanese songs. This prompted a group of 400 students in Taipei, Taiwan to begin a sit-in in front of the Executive Yuan in protest of Taiwan's Parade and Assembly Law ().
Background.
The name chosen by the students for their initiative, "Wild Strawberry", makes a pair of references. The word "wild" recalls the Wild Lily student movement of 1990, which led to vast political reforms and Taiwan's first general democratic elections. The word "strawberry" makes ironic use of the term "strawberry generation", a description of Taiwan's youth employed pejoratively by their elders to portray the newest generation as "soft", lacking strength of character and political convictions.
Demonstrations.
Sit-ins began with students in Taipei in front of the Executive Yuan. On November 7, 2008, police began removing protesters from the scene and taking them to separate locations around the city. Having made a regrouping plan earlier, the students reconvened at Liberty Square in front of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall.
Following the lead of the students in Taipei, six other sit-in protests sprang up around Taiwan:
Student demands and government responses.
The student-led sit-in protests were conducted in response to incidents of police violence and abuse of power during the visit of Chen Yunlin to Taiwan. The original protesters in Taipei issued a statement with the following demands:
Government responses to the Wild Strawberry petition included these actions:
The amended version of the law remained controversial at the time of drafting in May 2009. Proposed changes fell short of student demands for a law in Taiwan that resembles assembly laws in European Union nations and the United States that give priority to constitutional guarantees of rights to peaceful assembly and free speech. While the proposed amendments would make the new law generally more permissive than one crafted during the martial law period, proposals continued to give state police substantial powers of veto over the content and location of citizen rallies.
WildBerry House.
On January 4, 2009, the movement stopped sit-ins. A headquarters called "WildBerry House" () was established in Taipei for the movement. This location subsequently closed as of June 30, 2009.

Edith Starr Miller, Lady Queenborough (July 16, 1887 - January 16, 1933) was a New York socialite, author and anti-Mormon agitator who in 1921 became the second wife of Almeric Hugh Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough, a British Fascist.
Biography.
Edith was born in Newport, Rhode Island, the daughter of William Starr Miller and Edith Caroline Warren. Her father was a New York industrialist and real estate operator. 
On July 19, 1921, she married Lord Queenborough at the town house of Edith's parents, which was located at 1048 Fifth Avenue on the corner of 86th Street in Manhattan, New York. After their marriage the Pagets lived at Camfield Place, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The interiors of the house were designed by Edith herself. They had three daughters:
The Pagets were allegedly pro-Fascist, and Edith in particular was friendly with Brigadier General Robert Byron Drury Blakeney (1872-1952), second president of the British Fascisti from 1924-1926, and later active in the Imperial Fascist League, the Britons, the British Union of Fascists, and the Nordic League.
Edith's observations were outlined in her posthumously published "Occult Theocrasy", and added to the discussion of the secret societies and their conspiracies. Her information was drawn from existing sources, including the works of Dr. Karl Hacks and Léo Taxil ( pseudonym of Marie-Joseph Gabriel-Antoine Jogand-Pages ) ( 1854-1907 ), Taxil's supporter Abel Clarin de la Rive ( 1855-1914 ), Samuel Paul Rosen ( 1840-1907 ), theosophist Alice Bailey ( 1880-1949 ), Nesta Helen Webster ( 1876-1960 ), and esotericist Christina M. Stoddard, who wrote under the pseudonym "Inquire Within".
The Pagets later separated, and Edith sued in New York for legal separation on January 8, 1932, citing cruelty. 
She died in Paris a year later, on January 16, 1933.

Battle of Más a Tierra

The Battle of Más a Tierra was a First World War sea battle fought on 14 March 1915, near the Chilean island of Más a Tierra, between a British squadron and a German light cruiser. The battle saw the last remnant of the German East Asia Squadron destroyed, when was cornered and sunk in Cumberland Bay.
Background.
After escaping from the Battle of the Falkland Islands, and several auxiliaries retreated into the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to commence raiding operations against Allied shipping. These operations did little to stop shipping in the area, but still proved troublesome to the British, who had to expend resources to counter the cruiser. On 8 March, his ship low on supplies and in need of repairs, the captain of the "Dresden" decided to hide his vessel and attempt to coal in Cumberland Bay near the neutral island of Más a Tierra. By coaling in a neutral port rather than at sea, "Dresden"s Captain Lüdecke gained the advantage of being able to intern the ship if it was discovered by enemy vessels.
British naval forces had been actively searching for the German cruiser and had intercepted coded wireless messages between German ships. Although they possessed copies of captured German code books, these also required a "key" which was changed from time to time. However, Charles Stuart, the signals officer, managed to decode a message from "Dresden" for a collier to meet her at Juan Fernandez on 9 March. A squadron made up of the cruisers and along with the auxiliary cruiser cornered the "Dresden" in the bay on 14 March, challenging it to battle.
Battle.
"Glasgow" opened fire on "Dresden", damaging the vessel and setting it afire. After returning fire for a short period of time, the captain of "Dresden" decided the situation was hopeless as his vessel was vastly outgunned and outnumbered, while stranded in the bay with empty coal bunkers and worn out engines. Captain Lüdecke gave the order to abandon and scuttle his vessel. The German crew fled the cruiser in open boats to reach the safety of the island, which was neutral territory. The British cruisers kept up their fire on "Dresden" and the fleeing boats until the light cruiser eventually exploded, but it is unclear whether the explosion was caused by the firing from the British ships or from scuttling charges set off by the Germans. After the ship exploded, the British commander ordered his ships to capture any survivors from "Dresden". Three Germans were killed in action and 15 wounded. The British suffered no casualties.
Aftermath.
With the sinking of "Dresden", the last remnant of the German East Asian Squadron was destroyed, as all the other ships of the squadron had been sunk or interned. The only German presence left in the Pacific Ocean was a few isolated commerce raiders, such as SMS "Seeadler" and "Wolf". Because the island of Más a Tierra was a possession of Chile, a neutral country, the German Consulate in Chile protested that the British had broken international law by attacking an enemy combatant in neutral waters. The wounded German sailors were taken to Valparaíso, Chile for treatment, where one later died of wounds received during the action. The 315 of "Dresden"s crew who remained were interned by Chile until the end of the war, when those who did not wish to remain in Chile were repatriated to Germany. One of the crew—Lieutenant Wilhelm Canaris, the future admiral and head of Abwehr — escaped internment in August 1915 and made it back to Germany, where he returned to active duty in the Imperial Navy.

<doc id="20155706" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20155706" title="Self Winding Clock Company">
Self Winding Clock Company

The Self Winding Clock Company was a major manufacturer of electromechanical clocks from 1886 until about 1970. The Self Winding Clock Company(SWCC) clock mechanisms were truly revolutionary because the spring that powers the clock was not wound by hand but with an electric motor. The SWCC of New York was one of the first companies in the United States to successfully employ electric energy to power a clock. The winding motor is attached to, and mounted below, the conventional clock works. The unique feature of their patented clock mechanism is the automatic rewinding of the main spring each hour by the small electric motor. A contact switch mounted on the clock’s center shaft is activated after the clock has run for one hour and the main spring is rewound one revolution. This rewinding occurs each hour. The power for the motor is supplied by batteries and the batteries last about 1 year before needing to be replaced. This clock mechanism never needed to be wound by hand and this eliminated the concern that someone may forget to wind the clock. Hence the company name, The Self Winding Clock Company.
Selling Exact Time---A New Industry.
The motivation for establishing the Self Winding Clock Company was early entry into a revolutionary and potentially profitable new industry. The product this new industry was selling—Exact Time. This became possible following the development of the telegraph. The first marketers of time were observatories. The observatories used their celestial equipment to measure exact time and then transmit a time signal via telegraph lines to subscribers. This was done for a fee! In the 1850s and 1860’s communication and travel between cities became more common. The practice of observing local time was becoming obsolete and the need for everyone to agree to the exact time became essential. The railroads recognized that safety was related to precise timing and all timepieces in a given area must be set to the same time. The heads of the major railroads met on October 11, 1883, in Chicago to adopt our Standard Time System. The country was divided into four time zones with exactly one hour difference in each zone. The four time zones are part of the world wide system of Standard time ---a set of 24 somewhat equally spaced meridians tied to the daily cycle of daylight and darkness. It is based in Greenwich, England and termed Greenwich Mean Time.
Observatories had been selling exact time since the 1850s and transmitting the noon time signal via telegraph lines to customers, usually nearby cities and railroads. The signals were transmitted to sounders as second ticks and pauses that culminated in a noon time signal. The subscriber’s clock could then be manually adjusted to exactly noon. For providing this exact time service there was a monthly or yearly charge. Observatories were affiliated with colleges or universities with the exception of the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) which is affiliated with the United States government. Competition for customers was keen between observatories but by 1887 the USNO was recognized as the provider of Observatory Standard Time by the General Time Convention that had been convened by the countries railroads. This ended the intense competition for providing exact time. Western Union’s time service distributed the time signal via its telegraph lines. Western Union had years of experience in transmitting USNO time signals and ultimately emerged as the provider of nationwide telegraph lines for the noon time signal.
The competition for selling exact time necessitated developing a reliable master clock and auxiliary clocks. Connecting multiple clocks via electrical wires in a system had proved feasible. Two slightly different master clock-slave clock concepts emerged. The first entailed the use of an electro-mechanical “synchronizer” to forcibly bring the minute hand to the 12 position exactly on the hour. Each of the clocks in this system used a complete clock mechanism with the addition of a synchronizer. A central clock (master clock) sent the synchronizing signal along telegraph lines to each clock assuring that all clocks displayed exactly the same time. The individual clocks in this system had self-contained batteries and required 3 volts direct current (DC) to operate. The batteries for the synchronizing system transmission were located in a central office. The use of the mechanical synchronizer was the design of Chester Pond and his associates as they formed the SWCC in 1886. A second approach to synchronized time transmitted along wires was to connect a master clock to relatively simple secondary clocks (slave clocks). The slave clocks did not have complete clockworks but simply a mechanism that, when energized electrically from the master clock, would advance the clock hands one unit of time. The slave clock would display exactly the same time as the master clock. Slave clocks were much less complicated to manufacture and required little or no servicing. Initially they were more prone to failure. Each of the slave clocks had wires that connected to the master clock. The master clock in this system required 24 volts DC to both wind the master clock and as a source of current to advance the hands of the slave clock. These master-slave systems were more suited for individual buildings such as schools or factories rather than locations that were great distances apart. A master-slave clock system was developed and marketed in 1886 by Charles D. Warner and operated as the Standard Electric Time Company. The accuracy of the master-slave system was dictated by the accuracy of the master clock and reliability of the slave clocks. Over the years correction systems were developed for the master-slave systems that rendered the systems very reliable and accurate. In the first three decades of the 20th century many more companies entered the selling time business. When one considers the entire country, the number of synchronized clock systems installed in learning institutions, factories, businesses, government installations, transportation facilities, etc., etc. was enormous. Many hundreds of thousands of slave clocks and probably tens of thousands of master clocks were manufactured, sold, installed and serviced by people involved in the exact time for sale business.
Synchronized time systems were originally powered by batteries and most up through the 1950s operated on low voltage direct current. Eventually the new systems were designed to operate on alternating current. For many years selling exact time was a major industry. Presently the Global Positioning System (GPS) space-based satellite navigation system now provides our exact location and time information. Slave clocks, which were an integral part of the synchronized time system, now are often replaced with battery operated clocks that are linked to the atomic clock signal for synchronizing. Selling exact time has a fascinating history but its importance as an industry has been superseded.
Founding of the Self Winding Clock Company.
The Self Winding Clock Company clock movement was patented by one of the company founders, Chester Henry Pond (1844-1912) in 1884 (Patent No. 308,521). Pond was also a principal in the Gamewell Fire Alarm-Telegraph Company. He was not only an accomplished instrument maker but also a pioneer in the developing field of electricity. With these two skills he successfully designed a small electric motor and matched it with a conventional clock mechanism to create the reliable SWCC movement. 
In addition to the electric motor to wind the SWCC movement, in 1886, Chester Pond patented a correction device that used an electrical current to activate a mechanical lever attached to the clock movement. This correction attachment would move the clock hands precisely to the hour (Patent No. 339,688). If the clock is not absolutely accurate it would be corrected when receiving the hourly time signal over a telegraph line from a master clock calibrated to the US Naval Observatory. This correction was referred to as synchronizing and many SWCC clocks were fitted with this option.
The original SWCC factory was located at 205 Willoughby Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. This site was across from the Pratt Institute and now is part of the Pratt Institute campus. Charles Pratt (1830-1891), the founder of Pratt Institute, was also one of SWCC’s original founders and the company started business in his buildings. The SWCC factory remained in Brooklyn until they moved to 75 Varick Street, New York at some time in the 1950s, to apparently make room for expansion at the Pratt Institute. In addition to doing the clock manufacturing in Brooklyn, SWCC had business offices at various locations in New York city throughout its long history.
Self Winding Clock Company clock movements.
When Self Winding Clock Company started producing clocks the vast majority of the actual clock movements were made by the Seth Thomas Clock Company and the remainder were made by the E. Howard & Co.. The most expensive clocks could be equipped with the higher grade movement made by E.Howard. SWCC then fitted their motor winding components and synchronizing apparatus to the movements. The movements were mounted in cases of various designs, often in case styles similar to those of companies like Seth Thomas and E. Howard. The SWCC appears to have been manufacturing their own clock movements by 1892 for they are all stamped "Self Winding Clock Co". Earlier movements were stamped with Seth Thomas or E. Howard markings. The unique feature of SWCC clocks was the fact that the clocks were wound electrically. The success of SWCC depended upon the clocks being reliably wound every hour without failure. The hourly winding motor was the one element of the clock that was most likely to fail. Over a span of about 15 years the design of the SWCC movements went thru a series of modifications. All in search of a more reliable winding motor. The first 6 different styles all had the winding motor added to the SWCC movement. The final design, termed the "F" movement or Vibrator movement, was a major improvement. This movement, with minor modifications, was used for the next 60 plus years. The motor proved to be much more reliable and was now an integral part of the movement rather than added on below the clock works. The "F" movement motor employed a vibrating up and down motion rather than rotary motion to re-wind the mainspring. SWCC imprinted all of their movements with serial numbers. The serial numbers were used for inventory purposes and were assigned in ascending order. It is possible to approximately date the time of manufacture of a movement based on the serial number. The first "F" movements were made in 1898 and were made into the 1940s. It is not however possible to automatically then date a particular clock by the movement serial number. SWCC had a practice of exchanging clock movements rather than servicing a movement and then returning it to the same clock. This results in rarely finding a SWCC clock with its original movement.. Identification tag numbers also often do not match movement serial numbers because the tags were not changed when the movement was exchanged. The total number of "F" movements manufactured could be confusing. The lowest serial numbers are in the 33,000 range and the highest is in the 402,000 range. There were large numbering gaps and it has been calculated that probably around 200,000 movements were produced.
The Self Winding Clock Company and the Western Union Time Service.
The relationship between the two separate companies began with an agreement between Self Winding Clock Company and Western Union(WU) being entered into in June 1889. This agreement was for the transmission of time signals over Western Union telegraph lines to synchronize clocks made by Self Winding Clock Company. SWCC owned the clocks and WU installed and maintained them for a monthly fee, ranging from $1.25 to $2.00 per clock per month. SWCC was paid a percentage of the rental fee for providing clocks for the WU customers. If the clock movements required major repairs they were sent to a SWCC repair facility and a replacement movement was installed by WU at the customer location. The partnership between SWCC and WU ended in 1963 when, as part of a lawsuit settlement, WU purchased all the rental clocks from SWCC. By the late 1960s the time service business had run its course and ceased to be profitable. Most of the clocks were simply abandoned. These clocks are sought after by many clock collectors.
Notable Clocks Created by the Self Winding Clock Company.
The SWCC clock's were usually used in synchronized time systems. Time systems that consisted of many clocks linked electrically to a master clock. The majority of the systems were installed in businesses, factories, banks, schools & universities. Many railroads also relied on SWCC synchronized clock systems. Some clocks were sold as individual timepieces but most clocks were a part of time systems. SWCC offered many very elegant designs for their clocks and the clocks could be purchased to match any decor. These were essentially catalog items. There were however many special one of a kind clocks and clock systems that were installed by SWCC. These were intended to be very important architectural statements. Two of the most significant installations were the clocks in the Grand Central Terminal and the enormous 4 dial clock and lighting system for the Metropolitan Life Insurance building. The 2 pictured clocks of the Grand Central Terminal and the outside clocks on the Metropolitan Life Insurance building were just part of each properties very complex synchronized time systems. Grand Central Terminal had a master clock that controlled all the clocks at the terminal. Metropolitan Life had two separate master clocks. One controlled the motors for the 4 outside clocks, rang the bells in the bell tower and controlled the spectacular and very complex outside lighting system. Another SWCC master clock controlled 184 slave clocks throughout the original building. Complex SWCC synchronized systems were even installed in the London Underground. The underground installation started in 1905 and eventually included about 600 SWCC clocks.

2008 Malone Pioneers football team

The 2008 Malone Pioneers football team (variously "Malone" or "Malone University", formerly "Malone College") represents Malone University in the season of 2008. The Pioneers play their home games in Fawcett Stadium.
The schedule was originally to begin with three non-conference games. The September 6 game against Apprentice in Virginia was cancelled due to severe weather conditions. The remaining three non-conference games were against Union College in Kentucky and Olivet Nazarene University in Illinois, followed by St. Xavier later in the season. The season ended with a trip to the 2008 Victory Bowl in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Malone lost in a close game to Northwestern (MN).
Coaching staff.
Head Coach.
The head coach is Mike Gardner, who is in his third season at the helm of the Pioneers. Previously he was head coach at Tabor College. Gardner also works as the defensive coordinator for the team.
Assistant Coaches.
Assistant coaches for the team were:
"assistant coach reference"
Schedule.
"table statistics"
Game notes.
Apprentice.
The Pioneers scheduled season opener on September 6 at the Apprentice School in Newport News, Virginia was cancelled due to the arrival of Tropical Storm Hanna.
Union.
Malone entered halftime with a 28-21 lead, but was unable to keep pace after halftime. The offensive unit posted just 68 total yards over the final 30 minutes of the game.
The lack of offensive production led to a significant disparity in time of possession for the second half. Union college wore down the Pioneer defense in the hot and humid weather conditions, holding the ball for over 22 minutes during the final two quarters.
Malone dropped to 0-1 on the season with the seven-point defeat while Union improved to 2-0.
Olivet Nazarene.
The Malone College football team piled up 30 unanswered first-half points in a 43-3 victory on the road Olivet Nazaarene (IL) University. The Tigers were finally able to get on the scoreboard with a field goal on their opening drive of the third quarter, but that would turn out to be the only points Malone's defense would surrender as the unit limited Olivet Nazarene to 167 yards of total offense and 10 first downs.
Olivet Nazarene's three points in Saturday's contest marked the fewest total points allowed in a game by Malone since 1999 when the Pioneers shutout Urbana University on the road, 20-0. With the convincing victory, Malone improved its overall record to 1-1 on the year while Olivet Nazarene fell to 1-3.
Marian.
The Malone University football team opened 2008 Mid-States Football Association Mideast League play at Fawcett Stadium with a 45-37 victory over visiting Marian (IN) College. Prior to the home opener, there was plenty of excitement in the air with Homecoming festivities in full swing, new uniforms, and Friday's name change from Malone College to Malone University.
On the field, the Pioneers and Knights competed in an offensive shootout that saw a combined 1,013 total yards of offense, 11 touchdowns, and just four punts. Malone led 24-16 at halftime and then maintained at least an eight-point advantage over the final two quarters as each squad tacked on three touchdowns in the second half en route to the 45-37 final.
The loss brought Marian's three-game winning streak to a halt, dropping the Knights' record to 3-2 overall and 0-2 MSFA Mideast. The Pioneers, meanwhile, improved to 2-1 overall and 1-0 in conference play with the victory.
Taylor.
Malone entered this game ranked 25th in the NAIA National Poll. The Pioneers completed a 42-17 victory on the road at Taylor (IN) University. The Pioneers scored touchdowns on five of their first six possessions to take command of the League contest.
Malone led 35-3 at halftime and then stretched its advantage to 42-3 midway through the third quarter before Taylor added two late scores to account for the 42-17 final. The Pioneers more than doubled the Trojans total offensive output (633 total yards for Malone, 292 total yards for Taylor) and intercepted three Taylor passes while not committing a turnover of their own for the first time this season.
The win improved Malone's record to 3-1 overall and 2-0 in the MSFA Mideast while Taylor dropped to 2-4 overall and 0-2 in conference play.
Walsh.
Malone moved up in rankings to 22nd in the NAIA National Poll and registered a come-from-behind 24-21 victory over local rival Walsh University at Fawcett Stadium.
Trailing 21-17 late in the fourth quarter, the Pioneers took possession of the ball with 4:03 remaining on the clock and proceeded to march down the field on a 12-play, 96-yard scoring drive that was capped off by a 31-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Billy Bob Orsagh to wide receiver Tyler Davis.
Walsh then got the ball back with a little over a minute remaining, but was unable to get into field-goal range as the Pioneer defense stopped the Cavaliers on downs to cement the 24-21 victory. With the win, Malone claimed the Dick Gallagher Memorial Trophy for the third straight year and improved its record to 4-1 overall and 3-0 in the MSFA Mideast. Walsh dropped to 2-5 overall and 0-2 in league play with the loss.
Urbana.
Malone entered this week ranked 18th in NAIA National Poll and registered its fifth consecutive victory on Saturday afternoon at Fawcett Stadium with a 22-6 non-conference win against Urbana University. The Pioneers entered the contest with the top-rated offense in the NAIA.
Malone's defense limited Urbana to seven total first downs, negative seven (-7) rushing yards, and 127 yards of total offense. The Pioneers led 13-0 at halftime and then increased their score to 22-0 in the third quarter. Following a blocked fourth-quarter punt, Urbana managed to get on the scoreboard with a touchdown run.
Malone improved their overall record to 5-1 with the victory while Urbana, which is now in transition to becoming a member of NCAA Division II, dropped to 1-7 on the year.
St. Xavier.
The 16th-ranked Malone team rallied from a 23-14 fourth-quarter deficit to record a 27-23 win against NAIA No. 12 Saint Xavier (IL) University at Fawcett Stadium. The Saint Xavier entered the final quarter with a 16-7 lead, but Pioneer quarterback Billy Bob Orsagh led Malone back into the lead, throwing three touchdown passes to put Malone in front by 27-23 in the fourth quarter.
Saint Xavier threatened to score on its last possession of the game as they moved into scoring position with a first and goal on the Pioneers nine-yard line. However, as it was able to do throughout the contest, the Malone defense came up with a big stop when it needed it most, keeping the Cougars out of the end zone on four straight plays to preserve the four-point triumph.
The victory stretched the Pioneers current winning streak to six games and improved Malone's record to 6-1 overall and 4-0 in conference play. Saint Xavier, meanwhile, saw its six-game winning streak come to an end as the Cougars record fell to 6-3 overall and 3-1 in league play.
St. Francis.
The #10 Malone University football team suffered its first Mid-States Football Association Mideast League defeat of the year in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Malone committed four turnovers and had two punts blocked in the 45-24 loss to the #3-ranked University of Saint Francis.
The Pioneers trailed by a 24-10 deficit at halftime before Saint Francis scored three quick third-quarter touchdowns that stretched the lead to 45-10. Malone continued to play and added two late scores to cut the Saint Francis advantage to 45-24. However, the Pioneers were unable to overcome their early miscues, falling to 6-2 overall and 4-1 in the MSFA Mideast.
With the victory, Saint Francis secured at least a share of the league title, pushing its home winning streak to 50 games and improving its record to 9-0 overall and 5-0 in the MSFA Mideast.
Ohio Dominican.
The NAIA #13 Malone University football team scored 16 unanswered third-quarter points but still failed to overcome a 21-0 halftime deficit as the Pioneers concluded their regular-season schedule at Fawcett Stadium with a 34-24 loss to NAIA No. 23 Ohio Dominican University. The victory improved Ohio Dominican's record to 7-3 overall and 4-2 in the MSFA Mideast while Malone fell to 6-3 overall and 4-2 in league play.
Ohio Dominican entered the game coming of a previous 56-0 win over Urbana while Malone came in after a 45-24 loss to Saint Francis (Indiana). The previous meeting of the two teams was in 2007, when Ohio Dominican won 31-21.
Victory Bowl.
Malone concluded its 2008 play by taking on the 8-2 Northwestern (MN) Eagles in the 2008 Victory Bowl. The game was played at 7:00 PM (CST) on Friday November 21, 2008 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Malone was defending their title as the 2007 Victory Bowl winners, and made their third consecutive trip to the bowl.
Malone and Northwestern matched closely on statistics for the game with the exception of turnovers, where Northwestern had the advantage. In addition to fumbles, two interceptions were returned for touchdowns by Northwestern.
Season rankings.
At the conclusion of the 2008 regular season, Malone had created several impressive rankings for both individual and team play in the NAIA Division I, including:

Kraumur

Kraumur Music Fund is an independent Icelandic music fund and operation established by the Aurora Charity Foundation in the beginning of 2008 to ""to strengthen Icelandic musical life, primarily by supporting young musicians in performing and presenting their works.""
Among its board of advisers are artists Björk, Kjartan Sveinsson of Sigur Rós and author Sjón.
Kraumur runs a small office in Reykjavík, Iceland, from where it works on strengthening the position of young musicians in Iceland through direct grants, professional assistance and various forms of cooperation. Kraumur has worked with and supported artists like Mugison, Amiina, FM Belfast, pianist Víkingur Heiðar Ólafsson, Ólöf Arnalds and Dikta.
Special initiatives.
In the spring of 2008 Kraumur launched a program - 'Innrásin' - with the aim to support Icelandic artists to tour Iceland. Among artists featured on the first 'Innrásar-tours', playing in towns all over the island, were; Sign, Reykjavík!, Benni Hemm Hemm and Borko. 
Later that year plans for the first Kraumur Awards ('Kraumsverðlaunin' in Icelandic) were announced to acknowledge and support records being released by Icelandic artists. Nominations are chosen by a selected panel of Icelandic music journalist and radio show hosts.
Mission.
The Board of Aurora Charity Foundation issued the following statement when establishing the fund in January 2008;
“Icelandic musical life has a special uniqueness, in particular because of the palpable power and boldness that characterise young musicians. The Sugarcubes and Björk pioneered the global explosion of Icelandic music, and many musicians have followed in their footsteps with amazing results. Today, the Icelandic music experience has become one of the strongest elements of the image that Iceland and Icelanders enjoy abroad. The unusual interplay of pop and classical music can be a driving force in ongoing successes. The support of young musicians in their works, and in various forms of cooperation, creates a stronger foundation under this important growth area of Icelandic culture.”

Google matrix

[[Image:Googlematrixwikipedia2009.jpg|thumb|240px| Fig.1. Google matrix of Wikipedia articles network, written in the bases of PageRank index; fragment of
top 200 X 200 matrix elements is shown, total size
N=3282257 (from )]]
A Google matrix is a particular stochastic matrix that is used by Google's PageRank algorithm. The matrix represents a graph with edges representing links between pages. The rank of each page can be generated iteratively from the Google matrix using the power method. However, in order for the power method to converge, the matrix must be stochastic, irreducible and aperiodic.
Adjacency matrix "A" and Markov matrix "S".
In order to generate the Google matrix "G", we must first generate an adjacency matrix "A" which represents the relations between pages or nodes. 
Assuming there are "N" pages, we can fill out "A" by doing the following:
Construction of Google matrix "G".
Then the final Google matrix G can be expressed via "S" as:
By the construction the sum of all non-negative elements inside each matrix column is equal to unity. The numerical coefficient formula_8 is known as a damping factor.
Usually "S" is a sparse matrix and for modern directed networks it has only about ten nonzero elements in a line or column, thus only about 10"N" multiplications are needed to multiply a vector by matrix "G"[1,2]. 
Examples of Google matrix.
An example of the matrix formula_9 construction via Eq.(1) within a simple network is given in the article CheiRank.
For the actual matrix, Google uses a damping factor formula_10 around 0.85 The term formula_11 gives a surfer probability to jump randomly on any page. The matrix formula_12 belongs to the class of Perron-Frobenius operators of Markov chains [1. The examples of Google matrix structure are shown in Fig.1 for Wikipedia articles hyperlink network in 2009 at small scale
and in Fig.2 for University of Cambridge network in 2006 at large scale.
Spectrum and eigenstates of "G" matrix.
[[Image:Googlematrixcambridge2006spectrum.gif|thumb|280px| Fig3. The spectrum of eigenvalues of the Google matrix of University of Cambridge from Fig.2 at 
formula_13, blue points show eigenvalues of isolated subspaces,
red points show eigenvalues of core component (from )]]
For formula_14 there is only one maximal eigenvalue 
formula_15 with the corresponding right eigenvector
which has non-negative elements formula_16 which can be viewed as 
stationary probability distribution . These probabilities 
ordered by their decreasing values give the PageRank vector
formula_16 with the RageRank formula_18 used 
by Google search to rank webpages. Usually one has for the World Wide Web
that formula_19 
with formula_20. The number of nodes with
a given PageRank value scales as formula_21
with the exponent formula_22 [4,5].
The left eigenvector at formula_15 has constant matrix elements.
With formula_24 all eigenvalues move as
formula_25 except 
the maximal eigenvalue formula_15, which remains unchanged .
The PageRank vector varies with formula_27 but other eigenvectors
with formula_28 remain unchanged due to their orthogonality
to the constant left vector at formula_29.
The gap between formula_29 and other eigenvalue is
formula_31 gives a rapid convergence of a random initial vector to the PageRank approximately after 50 multiplications 
on formula_32 matrix.
At formula_13 the matrix formula_32
has generally many degenerate eigenvalues formula_35
(see e.g. Examples of the eigenvalue spectrum of the Google matrix of various directed networks is shown in Fig.3 from [14 and Fig.4 from .
The Google matrix can be also constructed for the Ulam networks generated by the Ulam method for dynamical maps. The spectral properties of such matrices are discussed in [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. In a number of cases the spectrum is described by the fractal Weyl law [10,12]. 
The Google matrix can be constructed also for other directed networks, e.g. for the procedure call network of the Linux Kernel software introduced in In this case the spectrum of formula_36 is described by the fractal Weyl law with the fractal dimension formula_37 (see Fig.5 from [16). Numerical analysis shows that the eigenstates of matrix formula_32 are localized (see Fig.6 from Arnoldi iteration method allows to compute many eigenvalues and eigenvectors for matrices of rather large size [13,14,16.
Other examples of formula_32 matrix include the Google matrix of brain 
and business process management see also [19. Applications of Google matrix analysis to
DNA sequences is described in Such a Google matrix approach allows also to analyze entanglement of cultures via ranking of multilingual Wikipedia articles abouts persons [21
Historical notes.
The Google matrix with damping factor was described by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998 see also articles PageRank and [23.

Auke Hulst

Auke Anthony Hulst (born May 20, 1975 in Hoogezand-Sappemeer, Groningen Province), is a Dutch novelist, journalist and musician.
Biography.
Hulst was raised in the hamlet of Denemarken (meaning: Denmark), in the north of the Netherlands. After a disorganized upbringing he studied Audiovisual Arts, Dutch literature and English at the University of Groningen. He did not finish any of these studies.
From 1998 on Hulst has been working for a number of prominent Dutch and Belgian newspapers and magazines, like Vrij Nederland, Esquire, Knack Focus, NRC Handelsblad, De Groene Amsterdammer, and De Standaard. In 2006 he made his literary debut with the novel "Jij en ik en alles daartussenin" (translation: You and me and everything in between.) In 2007 he produced, together with cartoonist Raoul Deleo, a hybrid between literary non-fiction and graphic novel, called "De eenzame snelweg" (translation: The lonely highway). It's the impressionistic story of a cross-country trip the authors made, commemorating fifty years of On The Road by Jack Kerouac. The book was nominated for a stripschap-penning and the Prix Saint-Michel.
In May 2009 Hulst publishes "Wolfskleren" (translation: Wolf's Clothes), a novel that coincides with a rock-album by Hulst's Sponsored by Prozac-project. Hulst also is one of the main drivers behind the Dutch-language band De Meisjes.
In 2012 his semi-autobiographical novel "Kinderen van het Ruige Land" (translation: Children of the Savage Land) was published to both critical and commercial acclaim, winning several smaller literary awards. After his publisher Meulenhoff failed to submit the book for both the Libris and Gouden Boekenuil-awards, two of the most important literary accolades for Dutch writers, Hulst changed publishers. 
Together with Wim Melis, curator of the Noorderlicht photo festival in Groningen, Hulst has created the photobook "The Pursuit of Happiness" (2009). As editor and essayist he co-created the Noorderlicht-publications "Warzone" (2010), which was about the war experiences of soldiers on international missions, and "The Sweet and Sour Story of Sugar" (2013).

<doc id="20155864" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20155864" title="Horned deity">
Horned deity

Deities depicted with horns or antlers are found in many different religions across the world.
Horned goddess Hathor.
Hathor is commonly depicted as a cow goddess with head horns in which is set a sun disk with Uraeus. Twin feathers are also sometimes shown in later periods as well as a menat necklace. Hathor may be the cow goddess who is depicted from an early date on the Narmer Palette and on a stone urn dating from the 1st dynasty that suggests a role as sky-goddess and a relationship to Horus who, as a sun god, is "housed" in her.
Hathor had a complex relationship with Ra, in one myth she is his eye and considered his daughter but later, when Ra assumes the role of Horus with respect to Kingship, she is considered Ra's mother. She absorbed this role from another cow goddess 'Mht wrt' ("Great flood") who was the mother of Ra in a creation myth and carried him between her horns. As a mother she gave birth to Ra each morning on the eastern horizon and as wife she conceives through union with him each day.
Bat was a cow goddess in Egyptian mythology depicted as a human face with cow ears and horns. By the time of the Middle Kingdom her identity and attributes were subsumed within the goddess Hathor. The worship of Bat dates to earliest times and may have its origins in Late Paleolithic cattle herding. Bat was the chief goddess of Seshesh, otherwise known as Hu or Diospolis Parva, the 7th nome of Upper Egypt.
The imagery of Bat as a divine cow was remarkably similar to that of Hathor the parallel goddess from Lower Egypt. The significant difference in their depiction is that Bat's horns curve inward and Hathor's curve outward slightly. It is possible that this could be based in the different breeds of cattle herded at different times.
Cult of the bull deities.
In Egypt, the bull was worshiped as Apis, the embodiment of Ptah and later of Osiris. A long series of ritually perfect bulls were identified by the god's priests, housed in the temple for their lifetime, then embalmed and encased in a giant sarcophagus. A long sequence of monolithic stone sarcophagi were housed in the Serapeum, and were rediscovered by Auguste Mariette at Saqqara in 1851. The bull was also worshipped as Mnevis, the embodiment of Atum-Ra, in Heliopolis. "Ka" in Egyptian is both a religious concept of life-force/power and the word for bull.
Mnevis was identified as being a living bull. This may be a vestige of the sacrifice of kings after a period of reign, who were seen as the sons of Bat or Hathor (see:horned goddess Hathor), the ancient cow deity of the early solar cults. Thus, seen as a symbol of the later sun god, Ra, the Mnevis was often depicted, in art, with the solar disc of their mother, Hathor between its horns.
The Canaanite deity Moloch (according to the bible) was often depicted as a bull, and became a bull demon in Abrahamic traditions. The bull is familiar in Judeo-Christian cultures from the Biblical episode wherein an idol of the Golden Calf is made by Aaron and worshipped by the Hebrews in the wilderness of Sinai ("Exodus"). The text of the Hebrew Bible can be understood to refer to the idol as representing a separate god, or as representing the God of Israel himself, perhaps through an association or syncretization with Egyptian or Levantine bull gods, rather than a new deity in itself.
Exodus 32:4 "He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt'."
Nehemiah 9:18 "even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!' They committed terrible blasphemies."
Calf-idols are referred to later in the Tanakh, such as in the Book of Hosea, which would seem accurate as they were a fixture of near-eastern cultures.
King Solomon's "bronze sea"-basin stood on twelve brazen bulls, according to 1. Kings 7:25.
Young bulls were set as frontier markers at Tel Dan and at Bethel the frontiers of the Kingdom of Israel.
Ram deities in ancient Egypt.
The ram was revered in ancient Egypt in matters of fertility and war. Early gods with long wavy ram horns include Khnum and the equivalent god in Lower Egypt, Banebdjedet, the "Ram Lord of Djedet" (Mendes), who was typically shown with four ram heads to represent the four souls ("Ba") of the sun god. Banebdjedet may also be linked to the first four gods to rule over Egypt, Osiris, Geb, Shu and Ra-Atum, with large granite shrines devoted to each in the Mendes sanctuary. The "Book of the Heavenly Cow" describes the "Ram of Mendes" as being the Ba of Osiris, but this was not an exclusive association.
List of Egyptian gods associated with the ram:
Cult of Ammon.
The worship of Ammon was introduced into Greece at an early period, probably through the medium of the Greek colony in Cyrene, which must have formed a connection with the great oracle of Ammon in the Oasis soon after its establishment. Ammon had a temple and a statue, the gift of Pindar, at Thebes, and another at Sparta, the inhabitants of which, as Pausanias says, consulted the oracle of Ammon in Libya from early times more than the other Greeks. At Aphytis, Chalcidice, Ammon was worshipped, from the time of Lysander, as zealously as in Ammonium. Pindar the poet honoured the god with a hymn. At Megalopolis the god was represented with the head of a ram (Paus. viii.32 § 1), and the Greeks of Cyrenaica dedicated at Delphi a chariot with a statue of Ammon.
Such was its reputation among the Classical Greeks that Alexander the Great journeyed there after the battle of Issus and during his occupation of Egypt, where he was declared "the son of Amun" by the oracle. Alexander thereafter considered himself divine. Even during this occupation, Amun, identified by these Greeks as a form of Zeus, continued to be the principal local deity of Thebes.
The Cyrenaican Greeks built temples for the Libyan god Amon instead of their original god Zeus. They later identified their supreme god Zeus with the Libyan Amon. Some of them continued worshipping Amon himself.
Amon's cult was so widespread among the Greeks that even Alexander the Great decided to be declared as the son of Zeus in the Siwan temple by the Libyan priests of Amon.
Although the most modern sources ignored the existence of Amun in the Berber mythology, he was maybe the greatest ancient Berber god. He was honored by the Ancient Greeks in Cyrenaica, and was united with the Phoenician/Carthaginian god Baal-hamon due to Libyan influence. Some depictions of the ram across North Africa belong to the lythic period which is situated between 9600 BC and 7500 BC. 
The most famous Amun's temple in Ancient Libya was the temple at the oasis of Siwa.
The name of the ancient Berber tribes: "Garamantes" and "Nasamonians" are believed by some scholars to be related to the name "Amon".
In Awelimmiden Tuareg, the name "Amanai" is believed to have the meaning of "God". The Ancient Libyans may have worshipped the setting sun, which was impersonated by Amon, who was represented by the ram's horns.
In Carthage and North Africa Baal-hamon was especially associated with the ram and was worshiped also as Baʿal Qarnaim ("Lord of Two Horns") in an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Bu Kornein ("the two-horned hill") across the bay from Carthage.
The Egyptian god Ammon-Ra was depicted with ram horns. Rams were considered a symbol of virility due to their rutting behavior. The horns of Ammon may have also represented the East and West of the Earth, and one of the titles of Ammon was "the two-horned." Alexander was depicted with the horns of Ammon as a result of his conquest of ancient Egypt in 332 BC, where the priesthood received him as the son of the god Ammon, who was identified by the ancient Greeks with Zeus, the King of the Gods. The combined deity Zeus-Ammon was a distinct figure in ancient Greek mythology. According to five historians of antiquity (Arrian, Curtius, Diodorus, Justin, and Plutarch), Alexander visited the Oracle of Ammon at Siwa in the Libyan desert and rumors spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander's father to be the deity Ammon, rather than Philip. Alexander styled himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon and even demanded to be worshiped as a god:
He seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own divinity and to have required its acceptance by others ... The cities perforce complied, but often ironically: the Spartan decree read, " 'Since Alexander wishes to be a god, let him be a god.' "
Horned deities by continent.
Europe.
Pan was a god of shepherds and flocks, of mountain wilds and rustic music.
Depictions in Celtic cultures of figures with antlers are often identified as Cernunnos ("horned one" in Latin). The prime evidence for this comes from a pillar in Paris which also features the Roman god Jupiter.
Cocidius was the name of a Romano-British war-god and local deity from the area around Hadrian's Wall, who is sometimes represented as being horned. He is associated with warfare and woodland and was worshipped mostly by military personnel and the lower classes.
Eliphas Levi, the 18th century occultist, believed that the pseudohistorical god "Baphomet" (that the Roman Catholic Church had claimed was worshipped by the heretical Knights Templar), was actually the horned Libyan oracle god (Ammon), or, the Goat of Mendes.
For many years scholars have interpreted the Gundestrup Cauldron's images in terms of the Celtic pantheon. The antlered figure in plate A has been commonly identified as Cernunnos.
Africa.
A ram-shaped oracle god whose name is unknown was worshiped by Libyan tribes at Siwa. The figure was incorporated by the Egyptians into depictions of their god Amun that's considered an "Interpretatio graeca" of the Greek Zeus-Ammon.
Adherents of Odinani (the traditional folk religion of the Igbo people of south-eastern Nigeria) worship the Ikenga, a horned god of honest achievement, whose two horns symbolise self-will. Small wooden statues of him are made and praised as personal altars.
Asia.
A seal discovered during the excavation of Mohenjo-daro in Pakistan has drawn attention as a possible representation of a "proto-Shiva" figure. This "Pashupati" (Lord of animal-like beings – Sanskrit ') seal shows a seated figure with horns, possibly ithyphallic, surrounded by animals.
The Rigveda has the related pashupa "protector of cattle" as a name of Pushan. The Pashupatinath Temple is the most important Hindu shrine for all Hindus in Nepal and also for many Hindus in India and rest of the world.
The name has also been applied to a figure, probably a deity, depicted as sitting among animals, on a seal discovered in the context of the Indus Valley Civilization.
Horns mentioned in the bible.
"I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up."
In majesty he (Jacob) is like a firstborn bull; his horns are the horns of a wild ox. With them he will gore the nations, even those at the ends of the earth.
Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.
The priest shall then put some of the blood on the horns of the (Yahweh's) altar of fragrant incense that is before the LORD in the tent of meeting. The rest of the bull’s blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
"The Canaanite gods Baal and El were horned bull gods as was, originally, Yahweh, which is why horns decorate the altar described in Leviticus 4:7."
Influence on Demonology.
Christian demonology.
The idea that demons have horns seems to have been taken from the Book of Revelation chapter 13. The book of Revelation seems to have inspired many depictions of demons. This idea has also been associated with the depiction of certain ancient gods like Moloch and the shedu, etc., which were portrayed as bulls, as men with the head of a bull, or wearing bull horns as a crown.
Baphomet of Mendes.
The satanic "horned god" symbol known as the baphomet is based on an Egyptian ram deity that was worshipped in Mendes, called Banebdjed (literally Ba of the lord of djed, and titled "the Lord of Mendes"), who was the soul of Osiris. According to "Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of ancient Egypt", the book's author Geraldine Pinch, said the ram gods Ra-Amun (see: Cult of Ammon), and Banebdjed, were to mystically unite with the queen of Egypt to sire the heir to the throne (a theory based on depictions found in several Theban temples in Mendes). Occultist Eliphas Levi in his "Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie" (1855), combined the images of the Tarot of Marseilles Devil card and refigured the ram Banebdjed as a he-goat, calling it the "Baphomet of Mendes," (or, "Goat of Mendes"). The inaccurate description can be traced back to "Herodotus' Histories Book II", where Herodotus describes the deity of Mendes as having a goats head and fleece, when Banebdjedet was really represented by a ram, not a goat.
The Baphomet of Lévi was to become an important figure within the cosmology of Thelema, the mystical system established by Aleister Crowley in the early twentieth century. Baphomet features in the Creed of the Gnostic Catholic Church recited by the congregation in "The Gnostic Mass", in the sentence: "And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His name BAPHOMET" (see: Aleister Crowley: Occult).
Lévi's Baphomet is the source of the later Tarot image of the Devil in the Rider-Waite design. The concept of a downward-pointing pentagram on its forehead was enlarged upon by Lévi in his discussion (without illustration) of the Goat of Mendes arranged within such a pentagram, which he contrasted with the microcosmic man arranged within a similar but upright pentagram. The actual image of a goat in a downward-pointing pentagram first appeared in the 1897 book "La Clef de la Magie Noire" by Stanislas de Guaita, later adopted as the official symbol—called the Sigil of Baphomet—of the Church of Satan, and continues to be used among Satanists.
Neopaganism.
Few neopagan reconstructionist traditions recognize Satan or the Devil outright. However, many neopagan groups worship some sort of Horned God, for example as a consort of the Great Goddess in Wicca. These gods usually reflect mythological figures such as Cernunnos or Pan, and any similarity they may have to the Christian Devil seems to date back only to the 19th century, when a Christian reaction to Pan's growing importance in literature and art resulted in his image being translated to that of the Devil.
Witch-cult hypothesis.
In 1985 Classical historian Georg Luck, in his "Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds", theorised that the origins of the Witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of Cernunnos, a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman Pan/Faunus, a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the Devil, and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.
Beelzebub.
There is an implied connection between Satan and Beelzebub (lit. "Lord of the Flies"), originally a Semitic deity called Baal (lit. "lord"). Beelzebub is the most recognized demon in the Bible, whose name has become analogous to Satan. Occult and metaphysical author Michelle Belanger believes that Beelzebub (a mockery of the original name) is the horned god Ba'al Hadad, whose cult symbol was the bull. According to "The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca", Beelzebub reigned over the Witches' Sabbath ("synagoga"), and that witches denied Christ in his name and chanted "Beelzebub" as they danced.
Beelzebub was also imagined to be sowing his influence in Salem, Massachusetts: his name came up repeatedly during the Salem witch trials, the last large-scale public expression of witch hysteria in North America or Europe, and afterwards Rev. Cotton Mather wrote a pamphlet entitled "Of Beelzebub and his Plot."
Neopaganism.
In 1933, the Egyptologist Margaret Murray published the book, "The God of the Witches", in which she theorised that Pan was merely one form of a horned god who was worshipped across Europe by a witch-cult. This theory influenced the Neopagan notion of the Horned God, as an archetype of male virility and sexuality. In Wicca, the archetype of the Horned God is highly important, and is thought by believers to be represented by such deities as the Celtic Cernunnos, Indian Pashupati and Greek Pan.
Horned God in Wiccan based neopagan religions represents a solar god often associated with vegetation, that's honored as the "Holly King" or "Oak King" in Neopagan rituals. Most often, the Horned God is considered a male fertility god. The use of horns as a symbol for power dates back to the ancient world. From ancient Egypt and the Ba'al worshipping Cannanites, to the Greeks, Romans, Celts, and various other cultures. Horns have ever been present in religious imagery as symbols of fertility and power. It was not until Christianity attributed horns to Satan as part of his iconography that horned gods became associated with evil in Western mythology:
Many modern neo-Pagans focus their worship on a horned god, or often "the" Horned God and one or more goddesses. Deities such as Pan and Dionysus have had attributes of their worship imported into the Neopagan concept as have the Celtic Cernunnos and Gwynn ap Nudd, one of the mythological leaders of the Wild Hunt

Tylosin

Tylosin is a bacteriostat food additive used in veterinary medicine. It has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms and a limited range of gram-negative organisms. It is found naturally as a fermentation product of "Streptomyces fradiae".
Tylosin is used in veterinary medicine to treat bacterial infections in a wide range of species and has a high margin of safety. It has also been used as a growth promotant in some species, and as a treatment for colitis in companion animals.
Mode of action.
Like other macrolides, tylosin has a bacteriostatic effect on susceptible organisms, caused by inhibition of protein synthesis through binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome.
Spectrum of activity.
Tylosin has a wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive bacteria including "Staphylococci", "Streptococci", "Corynebacteria", and "Erysipelothrix". It has a much narrower gram-negative spectrum of activity, but has been shown to be active against "Campylobacter coli", and certain spirochaetes. It has also been shown to be extremely active against "Mycoplasma" species isolated from both mammalian and avian hosts.
Clinical use.
Tylosin has been used to treat a variety of different diseases throughout the world. Differing formulations and licensing conditions will mean that it may not be a recognized method of treatment for certain conditions in certain countries. In general, tylosin is licensed for the treatment of infections caused by organisms susceptible to the drug, but it has also been used as a treatment of colitis in small animals, as a growth promotant in food producing animals, and as a way of reducing epiphora (tear staining) around the eyes of white faced dogs. In these cases, the resulte is positive only when using the tylosin in the form of tartrate, a chelating porphyrin. No marketing authority exists for the use of other tylosin forms as a tear stain remover and thus it is not legal to use it for such purposes- the exception being as a Prescription Only Medicine of last resort by vets under the Cascading Rule (UK) or the Extra Label rule (US).
Examples of bacterial infections that could potentially be treated with tylosin include respiratory infections, metritis, and acute mastitis in cattle; mastitis in sheep and goats; enteritis, pneumonia, erysipelas, and infectious arthritis in swine; and soft tissue infections in small animals.
While tylosin may be one appropriate therapeutic choice in theory for the conditions listed above, there are many other antibiotics that may be preferable for treating a specific infection, and Tylosin will not be the first choice.
It is also used as a growth promoter for a variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals grown for human consumption(Hirsch et al. 1999)
Available forms.
Tylosin is available in injectable, intramammary, and oral formulations with different product ranges available in different countries.
Precautions and contraindications.
Administration of tylosin should be avoided in animals with a known hypersensitivity to the product, or to other macrolides.
Oral administration can result in diarrhoea and gastrointestinal disturbance. This is particularly true of horses, such that it can be fatal. Tylosin also has a foul taste that is difficult to disguise.
The injectable formulations of tylosin can cause pain, inflammation, and itchiness around the injection site.
Since tylosin has a relatively poor spectrum of activity against gram-negative organisms, it may not be a sensible therapeutic choice in the treatment of infections caused by unknown, potentially unsusceptible organisms.
Drug interactions.
Tylosin may increase digitalis blood levels and, thus, its toxicity, and may be antagonistic to chloramphenicol or lincosamides. 
Colorimetric assays of serum ALT and AST may be falsely elevated by macrolide antibiotics.

Mitemcinal

Mitemcinal (GM-611 or 3'-N-dimethyl-11-deoxy-3'-N-isopropyl-12-O-methyl-11-oxo-8,9-didehydroerythromycin) is a motilin agonist derived from the macrolide antibiotic, erythromycin. It was discovered in the labs of Chugai Pharma. Mitemcinal is orally administered and it is believed to have strong promotility (or prokinetic) effects. Promotility drugs relieve symptoms of reflux by speeding the clearance of acid from the oesophagus and stomach. The parent compound, erythromycin, has these characteristics, but mitemcinal lacks the antibiotic properties of erythromycin. 
Presently, erythromycin is commonly used off-label for gastric motility indications such as gastroparesis. If mitemcinal can be shown to be as effective a promotility agent, it would represent a significant advance in the GI field as treatment with this drug would not carry the risk of unintentional selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This concept greatly intrigued Chugai, and the company pursued it as an ideal candidate for a long-term prokinetic agent to treat lower gastrointestinal deficiencies including gastroparesis. 
The Phase II trials did not detect an increase in gastric emptying among the population of diabetic gastroparesis patients above placebo. Thus, although Chugai was able to demonstrate the required safety of the compound, development of this drug has stalled due to a lack of convincing efficacy data.

Leonard Thompson (footballer)

Leonard Thompson (18 February 1901 – 26 August 1968) was an English professional footballer. He was born in Sheffield as the next to youngest child of Arthur William Thompson and Annie Willy. Too young to go to war, Thompson was encouraged to play for Sheffield school.
Playing career.
Thompson first joined Barnsley in 1917 as a 16-year-old amateur, he was on a trial and he managed to play in the afternoon match after the inside left was unable to; he scored a hat trick. He turned professional upon moving to Birmingham in 1918, a move he regretted later, as Manchester United and Liverpool FC were both looking to sign him. After this brief spell he moved to Swansea Town in 1922. In six seasons with Swansea he played nearly 200 league games scoring almost 100 goals as an inside forward, asgot part of the so-called "great little team" (being lower than average height), winning a Third Division South winners' medal in 1924–25, scoring the final goal to take them into the second division.
In Swansea's first season in the Second Division, his 19 goals helped Swansea finish in fifth place in the league. He also featured prominently in Swansea's 1925–26 FA Cup run in which they reached the semi-final, where they were beaten 3–0 by the eventual winners, Bolton Wanderers. During the cup run, Thompson scored four goals, including the opening goal against Arsenal in a 2–1 victory in round 6 (quarter finals).
The following season, Thompson was the club's leading goalscorer with 26 league and four cup goals, including a hat-trick on 8 January 1927 in a 4–1 FA Cup victory against Bury.
On 17 March 1928 he was signed by Arsenal for £4,000 but his career at Arsenal was plagued by a knee injury. He made his debut in a 2–0 defeat by Portsmouth on 28 March 1928 and at first shared the inside left position with Harold Peel, playing 17 times in 1928–29, scoring five goals as the side's penalty expert. However with his injury restricting him, despite many operations, he only made nine more appearances in four seasons for Arsenal, and spent most of his time there regularly coaching the reserve team and under him they were the London Combination Champions from 1928–1931, and they won the London FA Challenge cup in 1930-1. After not making any appearances at all in 1932–33 he left Arsenal for Crystal Palace, having made 27 appearances and having scored six goals in total. He retired from professional football the following season.
After Thompson retired, he reinstated as an amateur briefly at Islington Corinthians and later coached Tottenham Hotspur's reserve team, as well as a spell as a scout with Arsenal. Between 1947 and 1956 he was Arsenal's so called 'man in black' who watched the team arsenal was to play the next week, he featured in advertisements for Sandeman's Port, but no one ever discovered his identity, even when the daily express got a picture of him. On 26 August 1968 Len Thompson died of a heart attack aged 67.

Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez

Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez (born 1 August 1971), is a former Mexican drug lord and top leader of the criminal drug trafficking organization known as the Gulf Cartel. He was among Mexico's most-wanted drug lords.
He joined the ranks of the Gulf Cartel in the late 1990s after he had served as a policeman in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Under the tutelage of Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, Costilla Sánchez became a lieutenant for the cartel and started controlling several drug trafficking activities for the organization. In 1999, two U.S. federal agents were stopped at gunpoint in Matamoros by several gunmen of the cartel while conducting an investigation. Among the dozen heavily armed men were Cárdenas Guillén and Costilla Sánchez. After the tense standoff, the agents persuaded the gunmen to let them go but Costilla Sánchez and the other cartel members earned a U.S. indictment.
When Cárdenas Guillén was arrested and extradited to the United States in 2003 and 2007 respectively, Costilla Sánchez took the control of the cartel along with Antonio Cárdenas Guillén, who was later killed in a gunbattle on November 2010. Amid the power struggles, Los Zetas separated from the cartel to work independently, transforming northeastern Mexico into a "war zone" with daily confrontations and gruesome assassinations.
Costilla Sánchez was arrested by the Mexican marines in the city of Tampico, Tamaulipas, on 12 September 2012. The Gulf Cartel, however, was suffering from an infighting by the time of his arrest.
Criminal career.
Costilla Sánchez was born on 1 August 1971 in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas; he is the son of a woman who worked as the principal of a middle school in Matamoros. At the age of 21, he became a municipal police officer in Matamoros and worked from 1992 to 1995, where he became familiar with the drug trade. Costilla Sánchez then left the police and formed a kidnapping ring called "Los Sierra."
He joined the works of the Gulf Cartel in the late 1990s and become a lieutenant during the reign of then-leader Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. The Gulf Cartel is responsible for the importation and distribution of thousands of kilograms of cocaine and marijuana into the United States annually. After the arrest of the cartel leader Osiel Cardenas, Costilla Sánchez took control and became partner with Antonio Cárdenas Guillén, Heriberto Lazcano and Héctor Manuel Sauceda Gamboa ("El Karis"). Sauceda was killed in a gun battle with the Federal Police on 17 February 2009, and Heriberto Lazcano transformed Los Zetas into his own cartel in 2010, becoming rival to the Gulf Cartel.
Costilla Sánchez is one of a number of high-ranking members of the Gulf Cartel who has been indicted in the United States for drug trafficking activities. Costilla Sánchez has also been indicted for threatening U.S. law enforcement officials in November 1999. In that incident, FBI and DEA agents in Mexico were forcibly stopped at gunpoint by a group of heavily armed men, allegedly including Costilla Sánchez and other key members of the Gulf Cartel. Costilla Sánchez and the other cartel members were said to have pointed AK-47 rifles at the U.S. federal agents and threatened to kill them. After a tense standoff, the FBI and DEA agents were allowed to leave.
When Osiel was arrested in 2003, Costilla Sánchez joined the drug lord's brother, Antonio Cárdenas Guillén, in running the Gulf Cartel's operations. The power struggle after Osiel's extradition in 2007 prompted for Los Zetas, the mercenary gang formed by ex-commandos of the Mexican Army and the former armed wing of the cartel, to separate and former their own criminal organization. Both groups officially went to war in early 2010, after a Zeta leader was assassinated allegedly under orders of Costilla Sánchez. The fight between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas transformed northeastern Mexico into a "war zone" with daily gunfights, decapitations, and other gruesome slayings. After the death of Antonio in a gunfight with the Mexican Marines on 5 November 2010, Costilla Sánchez took full control of the Gulf Cartel and began directing the daily drug trafficking activities of the organization.
The recent fights between Los Metros and Los Rojos, the two subgroups within the Gulf Cartel, were reportedly caused by Costilla Sánchez, who set up his rivals to get arrested or killed by the government. Among other charges, Costilla Sánchez is accused of being involved in the 2004 assassination of the journalist Francisco Arratia Saldierna, who covered drug trafficking and organized crime reports in Matamoros. In addition, the "Proceso magazine" alleges that Costilla Sánchez had some connections with high-ranking military officials in the Mexican Armed Forces between 2011 and 2012.
Standoff with U.S. agents.
In a November afternoon of 1999, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén learned that a Gulf Cartel informant was being transported through Matamoros, Tamaulipas, by the FBI and DEA. According to the story mentioned in the interviews 11 years after this life-or-death incident, the DEA agent Joe DuBois and FBI agent Daniel Fuentes were riding in a white Ford Bronco with diplomatic plates along the streets of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. For years, both were working for the disarticulation of the cartels in Mexico, and both knew how the drug cartels worked south of the border. In the back seat of the car, a Mexican informant from a local newspaper on crime coverage guided the two agents and gave them a tour on the city's drug routes and on the homes of the drug lords of the city. They even cruised on Cárdenas' house, a pink-colored mansion with tall walls, security cameras, armed guards and roof-snipers. Within moments, according to DuBois, a Lincoln Continental was on their tail, then a stolen pickup truck with Texan plates. The federal agents were cut off and surrounded by at least five vehicles, including one by a former state police officer. Just yards away from Matamoros' police department, the agents were surrounded by a convoy of gunmen from the Gulf Cartel, which included Costilla Sánchez. Some wore police and military uniforms. Nearby, other men, also in police uniform, directed traffic.
Cárdenas Guillén and his men intercepted and surrounded the vehicle on a public street and demanded for the informant to be released to him. According to the two agents, the Gulf Cartel sicarios outnumbered and outgunned them. Their only way out was to talk their way out. Cárdenas Guillén arrived seconds later in a white Jeep Cherokee, approaching the two agents with the "swagger of the man in charge." In his waistband, he wore a Colt pistol with a gold grip; in his hands, a gold-plated AK-47. Cárdenas Guillén pounded the Ford Bronco and calmly asked for the informant. Fuentes flashed his FBI badge, giving Cárdenas Guillén a smile. In an ongoing discourse, Cárdenas Guillén told the agents that he would shoot them if they did not surrender. The two agents refused to do so, saying they were dead either way. He gave them another choice: to hand over the informant. Again, they refused.
DuBois, who grew up in Mexico and was a police officer in neighboring Brownsville, Texas, recalled how Cárdenas Guillén "did not give a damn who were," while DuBois replied to him: "You don't care now, but tomorrow and the next day and the rest of your life, you'll regret anything stupid that you might do right now. You are fixing to make 300,000 enemies." Then, Fuentes reminded Cárdenas Guillén how the U.S. launched a massive manhunt and investigation after the kidnap, torture, and assassination of the DEA agent Enrique Camarena in 1985 in Mexico. All of the killers and accomplices were captured in that U.S. operation.
After a tense standoff, DuBois and Fuentes, along with their informant, were released. The two agents and the informant headed off to Brownsville, Texas. As for Cárdenas, the damage had been done by taking on the U.S. government, which placed pressure on the Mexican government to apprehend Cárdenas. The two agents, Joe DuBois and Daniel Fuentes, were recognized by the U.S. attorney general for their "exceptional heroism," and both are still on the job. The Mexican informant is living somewhere in the United States.
Gulf-Zeta cartels split.
In the late 1990s, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the former leader of the Gulf Cartel, began recruiting members of the Mexican Army to protect his territory, personnel, and drug trafficking operations. These original deserters, who were known as Los Zetas, came from the Special Forces squadron of the army, arguably the best trained branch of the Mexican military. Upon the arrest and extradition of Cárdenas Guillén in 2003 and 2007 respectively, Los Zetas strengthen its role in the Gulf Cartel, but managed to retain its alliance. Nonetheless, that alliance lasted until early 2010, when disagreements reached a turning point. On 18 January 2010, several members of the Gulf Cartel kidnapped Víctor Peña Mendoza, a leader of Los Zetas nicknamed "Concord 3" and a close associate and friend of Miguel Treviño Morales, alias "Z-40." When he was held captive, Peña Mendoza was asked to switch alliances and join the Gulf Cartel, but he refused, earning a beating and an execution, presumably carried out by Samuel Flores Borrego.
Treviño Morales heard about the incident and issued an ultimatum to Flores Borrego and Costilla Sánchez: 
Both of the Gulf Cartel leaders ignored the command, and Treviño Morales did not wait to avenge the death of his friend. On 30 January 2010, Treviño Morales kidnapped and murdered 16 Gulf Cartel members in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, marking the start of the cartel war between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Veracruz that has left thousands of people killed. Los Zetas used violent and intimidation tactics to expand, emerging with a notorious reputation as Mexico's most violent drug trafficking organization. Through these tactics, it has managed to take control of most of the territories "owned" by the Gulf Cartel where they had once essentially served as a single organization.
PRI candidate assassination.
On the morning of 28 June 2010, Rodolfo Torre Cantú, the leading candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) for the Tamaulipas state elections, was heading to the airport in Ciudad Victoria to close his campaign in Valle Hermoso and Matamoros, Tamaulipas six days before the elections. While heading to the airport, Torre Cantú's convoy was ambushed by armed assailants, killing the candidate and six other people who were in his entourage. His death marked the highest-profile murder in the Mexican Drug War and the highest-profile assassination in Mexico since the death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI presidential candidate for the 1994 elections. By 2011 and into 2012, the Mexican authorities still did not have solid evidence to prosecute Torre Cantú's assassins.
Nonetheless, Costilla Sánchez was linked to Torre Cantú's assassination by the PGR and the DEA agencies on 20 September 2012. Reportedly, Torre Cantú was killed by an armed squad directly linked to Costilla Sánchez for refusing to protect the cartel's investments that allowed money laundering from drug proceeds. Tamaulipas' former governor, Tomás Yarrington, has also been linked to Torre Cantú's death by the DEA since February 2012.
Arrest.
The Mexican Navy arrested Costilla Sánchez on 12 September 2012 at the residential Lomas de Rosales neighborhood in Tampico, Tamaulipas without firing a single bullet. Around 30 marines chased a convoy of gunmen that led to the house where Costilla Sánchez was staying. Hours before the arrest, five men working for Costilla Sánchez were apprehended in Río Bravo, Tamaulipas. Costilla Sánchez was presented on camera on the morning of 13 September 2012, handcuffed and wearing a long-sleeve shirt. Ten bodyguards of Costilla Sánchez were also arrested during the operation. Ernesto Banda Chaires, one of the detainees, is believed to be the regional boss of the cartel in Tampico. In the Wednesday arrest, the Mexican authorities confiscated several assault rifles, pistols encrusted with jewelry, and a number of expensive-looking watches. When asked if he had anything to say about his criminal charges and if he had a lawyer, Costilla Sánchez shook his head. His arrest came a few days after the apprehension of Mario Cárdenas Guillén, the leader of one of factions in the cartel. Moreover, Costilla Sánchez is currently detained at the installations of the SIEDO, Mexico's intelligence agency.
Costilla Sánchez was an evasive capo who preferred to stay low-profile. Only two photographs of him were ever made public prior to his arrest.
It is likely that Costilla Sánchez will be extradited to the United States, raising political implications for the top politicians in the states of Tamaulipas and Veracruz who have been accused of taking bribes from the Gulf Cartel. Among them is Tomás Yarrington, the former governor of Tamaulipas who is now a fugitive. If the testimonies end up being damaging, President Enrique Peña Nieto will have to take steps to clean up the image of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governed Mexico for 71 years and was tainted with an image of corruption. In addition, with Costilla Sánchez's capture, the Gulf Cartel appears to be extremely weakened and the stage is set for Mexico's two largest criminal organizations – the Sinaloa Cartel and Los Zetas – to fight for the turf of the Gulf Cartel. This will be troubling for the government, which has vowed to reduce the drug violence that has left more than 55,000 dead in six years.
Two days after the arrest of Costilla Sánchez, 16 people were killed as a result of the Gulf Cartel infighting in two separate attacks carried out in Nuevo Laredo and San Fernando, Tamaulipas. Reportedly, a message was left aside the bodies, which were dumped in public view.
Theoretical aftermaths.
The capture of Costilla Sánchez and Mario Cárdenas Guillén leaves the Gulf Cartel without a definite successor. Both arrests, in effect, wipe out the traditional old-time bosses of the cartel, putting an end to a generation of drug traffickers. When Cárdenas Guillén was arrested on 4 September 2012, it looked as if Costilla Sánchez had finally won the leadership of the Gulf Cartel. Throughout the end of 2011 and until the time of his arrest in 2012, Costilla Sánchez had carried out a campaign to put down Cárdenas Guillén and his faction – the Rojos – by reportedly setting up its members to get arrested or killed. His attempts to successfully put down his rivals allegedly gave him the protection of some high-ranking officials in the Mexican Armed Forces.
Nonetheless, Costilla Sánchez's own tactics backfired after a group of his henchmen arrested in Río Bravo, Tamaulipas reportedly betrayed him and notified the authorities of his whereabouts. It is also possible Cárdenas Guillén's declarations resulted in the apprehension of Costilla Sánchez as well.
Without a clear successor of Costilla Sánchez, his faction – the Metros – could come to an end, although it is still likely that there are other old-crime bosses of lesser importance still trying to keep the Gulf Cartel operating. With the arrest of a Gulf Cartel representative in Colombia on 10 September 2012, the drug business could be disrupted even further. One clear benefactor of the fall of the Gulf Cartel is its rival group, Los Zetas. It is also possible that several within the Gulf Cartel may decide to join the Sinaloa Cartel or Los Zetas, although the latter seems unlikely given the bitter feelings between both groups. The Mexican government has essentially gotten rid of the leadership in both the Metros and the Rojos factions in the Gulf Cartel. The first possible group to take control of the smuggling routes in Tamaulipas is Los Zetas, who can decide to make a violent push into the last territories of the Gulf Cartel and finally take control of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. That city is the birthplace of the Gulf Cartel and has been the stronghold of the cartel ever since its creation. By taking Matamoros, Los Zetas will not only take a valuable drug corridor from the hands of the cartel, but it can score a major "psychological victory" over the Gulf Cartel.
As of mid-2013, however, Los Zetas is also experiencing a power struggle within its own ranks, so the future of the Gulf Cartel is difficult to predict.
The Mexican authorities believe that the next leader of the Gulf Cartel could be a woman, presumably one of the two sisters of Osiel, Antonio, and Mario. While women leading Mexico's "macho" criminal underworld is quite unusual, it is not entirely unprecedented. Enedina Arellano Félix of the Tijuana Cartel now manages the organization along with her son Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano. Another woman, Sandra Ávila Beltrán, served as an important link between the Sinaloa Cartel and the Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia until her arrest in 2007. The authorities believe that if one of the Cárdenas Guillén sisters takes over leadership of the Gulf Cartel, it could serve to unite the broken organization. Nonetheless, InSight Crime argues that if the Gulf Cartel's last chance to regain its hegemony lies on a female successor, there is little chance that the cartel will ever recover. As previously reported by the agency, "drug queens" in Mexico tend to have difficulty commanding their cartels, and have been forced to work alongside men to legitimize their positions.
In addition, the arrest of Costilla Sánchez opens a bigger role for the Sinaloa Cartel in the state of Tamaulipas. Since their leader Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán and the Gulf Cartel tend to be "business-oriented," both organizations may possibly strengthen their alliances by acknowledging that "violence is bad for business." This is one reason why the Gulf Cartel and "El Chapo" might fight off Los Zetas together. Mario Ramírez Treviño, the right-hand man of the fallen Samuel Flores Borrego, was the next in line after Costilla Sánchez. Nonetheless, whoever decides to lead the Gulf Cartel will most likely have a close relationship with "El Chapo". The Gulf Cartel is knowledgeable of the trafficking routes and operations in Tamaulipas, and it would not be convenient for the Sinaloa Cartel to take them "out of the picture." If the Sinaloa Cartel manages to have significant presence in Tamaulipas, the population can expect a decrease in violence just like in Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, which saw downturns in drug-related homicides after the Sinaloa Cartel gained control of the smuggling routes.
Gulf Cartel infighting.
Background.
In the late 1990s, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the former leader of the Gulf Cartel, had other similar groups besides Los Zetas established in several cities in Tamaulipas. Each of these groups were identified by their radio codes: the Rojos were based in Reynosa; the Metros were headquartered in Matamoros; and the Lobos were established in Laredo. The infighting between the Metros and the Rojos of the Gulf Cartel began in 2010, when Juan Mejía González, nicknamed "El R-1", was overlooked as the candidate of the regional boss of Reynosa and was sent to the "Frontera Chica," an area that emcompasses Miguel Alemán, Camargo and Ciudad Mier – directly across the U.S-Mexico border from Starr County, Texas. The area that Mejía González wanted was given to Samuel Flores Borrego, suggesting that the Metros were above the Rojos.
Unconfirmed information released by "The Monitor" indicated that two leaders of the Rojos, Mejía González and Rafael Cárdenas Vela, teamed up to kill Flores Borrego. Cárdenas Vela had held a grudge on Flores Borrego and the Metros because he believed that they had led the Mexican military to track down and kill his uncle Antonio Cárdenas Guillén ("Tony Tormenta") in 5 November 2010. Other sources indicate that the infighting could have been caused by the suspicions that the Rojos were "too soft" on the Gulf Cartel's bitter enemy, Los Zetas. When the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas splited in early 2010, some members of the Rojos stayed with the Gulf Cartel, while others decided to leave and join the forces of Los Zetas.
InSight Crime explains that the fundamental disagreement between the Rojos and the Metros was over leadership. Those who were more loyal to Mario Cárdenas Guillén stayed with the Rojos, while those loyal to Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, like Flores Borrego, defended the Metros.
Originally, the Gulf Cartel was running smoothly, but the infighting between the two factions in the Gulf Cartel triggered when Samuel Flores Borrego was killed on 2 September 2011. When the Rojos turned on the Metros, the largest faction in the Gulf Cartel, firefights broke throughout Tamaulipas and drug loads were stolen among each other, but the Metros managed to retained control of the major cities that stretched from Matamoros to Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas.
Alleged ties with the Mexican military.
The power struggle within the Gulf Cartel in northeastern Mexico throughout 2011 and 2012 was a sign of the organization's decline. Part of the shifting landscape, according to "Proceso magazine", is attributed to the alleged protection the Mexican Armed Forces gave to Costilla Sánchez. An anonymous source told the magazine that Costilla Sánchez set up his rivals, the Cárdenas Guillén family, to get arrested or killed by the Mexican Navy, consequently allowing him to emerge as the leader of the Gulf Cartel. Costilla Sánchez reportedly gave millions of dollars to the Navy to allow him to operate freely in Tamaulipas, and in return the Navy reportedly protected his faction by ceasing to target them and going against the Cárdenas Guillén clan.
The last days of Costilla Sánchez's leadership began in 3 September 2012, when several banners were reportedly put up in Ecatepec, State of Mexico, accusing the capitan of the Mexican Naval Infantry, Marina Efraín Martínez Talamantes, of protecting Costilla Sánchez. Nine days later, Costilla Sánchez was arrested in an operative where not a single shot was fired. The anonymous source said that the Navy arrested him because the accusations were starting to gain some weight, while others said that once the Navy was done "using Costilla Sánchez" to their advantage, they "betrayed him" so that his capture could serve as a symbolic medal for the Navy and the administration of Felipe Calderón. The sources stated that before his arrest, Costilla Sánchez was allegedly seeking to forge an alliance with Miguel Treviño Morales ("Z-40"), one of the leaders of Los Zetas, the former armed wing of the Gulf Cartel.
InSight Crime, however, states that the fact that the whole article relies on a single anonymous source and that there are no voice recordings raises suspicions about the reliability of the story. The agency does recognize that Costilla Sánchez's ties with the Navy were possible, but indicated that "if his enemies were looking to make life difficult both for him and for the military units operating in Tamaulipas, feeding falsehoods to reporters would be an easy way to do so."
Bounty.
Costilla Sánchez was placed among the most-wanted drug lords in Mexico, and the government was offering a 30 million pesos (US$2.3 million) bounty for information leading to his arrest. In the United States, he has been charged with 12 counts of drug trafficking and money-laundering and is also wanted for assaulting a federal law enforcement officers in 1999 in Matamoros, Tamaulipas.
The U.S. Department of State was offering a reward of up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction.
Costilla Sánchez has several aliases, including but not limited to: "Cos", "El Coss", "Costi", "El Judas", "George XX", and "Sombra".

Ethiopia–Finland relations

Finland-Ethiopia relations are foreign relations between the Finland and Ethiopia. Both countries established diplomatic relations on July 17, 1959. Ethiopia is represented in Finland through its embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. Finland has an embassy in Addis Ababa.
The Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs traces the relationship between the two countries to the 1950s when Finnish missionaries first came to Ethiopia. In March 1984 the two countries signed a Memorandum on Development Cooperation. In 2003, the Finnish Foreign Minister, Erkki Tuomioja, visited Ethiopia.
Finnish assistance.
Ethiopia is one of Finland’s long-term partners in economic development and in the water and education sectors. Finland began bilateral development cooperation with Ethiopia in 1967. Development cooperation was suspended during the Ethiopian Civil War in 1991–93, and again in 1998–2000 during the Eritrean-Ethiopian War. Finland, like other donors, did not make any new cooperation commitments in 2005 as a result of the violence following the parliamentary elections, but did resume cooperation at the previous level in 2007.
On 29 April 2009, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development announced that the Finnish government had made a grant of 11.4 million Euros to enable the Benishangul-Gumuz Region upgrade its capacity of planning and managing its rural water supply and sanitation program to achieve universal access for all Ethiopians. On 28 July 2009, the Finnish Ambassador, Kirsti Aarnio, praised Ethiopia’s effort to pull itself out of poverty by achieving successive economic growth. She described their trade as Finland importing coffee, spices and leather from Ethiopia, while Ethiopia buys in various high-tech products from Finland. She also stated that ample opportunities existed where the two sides can boost cooperation in the areas of environment, information technology, telecommunication services and energy.

William Cozens-Hardy, 2nd Baron Cozens-Hardy

William Hepburn Cozens-Hardy, 2nd Baron Cozens-Hardy (25 March 1869 – 25 May 1924) was a British Liberal politician and lawyer.
Family.
Cozens-Hardy was the eldest son of Herbert Cozens-Hardy, 1st Baron Cozens-Hardy and Maria Hepburn. Herbert Cozens-Hardy was a lawyer and Liberal Member of Parliament for North Norfolk from 1885-99. He was then appointed a judge and eventually became Master of the Rolls. The Barony was created in 1914 and William succeeded as 2nd Baron on the death of his father in 1920. In 1895, he married Gertrude Lilian the eldest daughter of Colonel Sir William Everett KCMG. They had one daughter.
Education.
William was educated at University College School in Hampstead where he was leader of the school debating society and Captain of School. He then went up to New College, Oxford where he took his degree with classical honours.
Career.
Like his father, William went into the law. He was called to the Bar at Lincoln’s Inn in 1893 and took silk in 1912. He was made a Bencher of Lincoln’s Inn in 1916. He also sat as a Justice of the Peace in Norfolk. In 1913 he was offered the post of Chief Justice of Bengal but refused for private reasons. Throughout the four years of the First World War, he was a Commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, serving on the Admiralty War Staff, attached to the Intelligence Department. He was awarded the Italian Order of St Maurice and St Lazarus. He was knighted in 1912.
Politics.
Cozens-Hardy also followed his father in his political affiliation. While at Oxford University he was involved in Liberal politics, being a member of the Russell Club and he was President of the Union. He was elected as Liberal MP for South Norfolk at the 1918 general election. Although he stood as a Coalition Liberal at that election he did not receive the Coalition coupon. One source indicates this was because he was late entering the field. He then chose to take the Coalition whip in Parliament. William's political stance in the election has been described as a "...conventional Coalition programme: support for Lloyd George and harsh peace with Germany, jobs abd houses for the returning soldiers all topped off with expressions of concern about agriculture and repeated references to his own Norfolk roots." 
When William succeeded his father to the peerage he had to stand down from the House of Commons and in the by-election of 27 July 1920 which followed, his seat was won by George Edwards, the Labour candidate with the Liberal vote split between Lloyd George Coalition Liberal and Asquithian Independent Liberal candidates.
Death.
Cozens-Hardy was a pioneer of motoring. In the early days of his marriage he and his wife would undertake long and hazardous trips around continental Europe. This love of cars was the cause of his death as he was killed in a motor accident at Bucchof, Starnberg in Bavaria on 25 May 1924. As he had no male heir, the title passed to his younger brother, Edward Herbert Cozens-Hardy (1873–1956).

John Battendieri

John Battendieri is a businessman and pioneer of the U.S. Organic movement.
History.
Raised in New Jersey, Battendieri has been working since he came to California in the early 1970s to bring natural food to people. He initially produced "Mr. Natural" apple juice, which paved the way for other growers to recognize a demand for packaged organic products and follow suit. At a time when Wonder Bread could build strong bodies 12 ways, and better living through chemistry, it was unlikely that there would be a demand for unprocessed or naturally processed foods. Mr. Natural claims to be "one of the original makers of organic juices--definitely the only pure Santa Cruz mountain apple juice" at that time on the market.
He is a former president of Organic Food Products Inc., a Morgan Hill company that merged with Spectrum Naturals in May, 1999 and produces "Millina’s Finest" pasta sauces and products.
He is the founder of Santa Cruz Organics, which is now owned by J.M. Smucker.
He is the CEO of Blue Horizon Organic Seafood Company, based in Aptos, California, which produces hormone and antibiotic-free shrimp that is raised by family farmers using sustainable and organic methods. Their "Last Minute Chef" products have no MSG, preservatives, or flavor-enhancing synthetic chemicals. Because California does not have an official definition for "organic seafood", New Leaf Markets has sold the shrimp from Blue Horizon as "Organic Everywhere But California."
Charity.
Battendieri has participated with friends the past several years in the Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group (SCCBG) to raise funds for cancer research and treatment through Gourmet Grazing on the Green, a charitable food fest of local produce. Formed in 1995, the Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group has given over $800,000 to fund support services and cancer research. Mr. Battendieri is a founder. Earlier charitable work includes donations to Second Harvest Food Bank based on every jar of sauce sold. This was estimated to be about 12,000 free meals in Santa Cruz county in 1994.

Stand By for Action

Stand By for Action (British title: Cargo of Innocents) is a 1942 American war film directed by Robert Z. Leonard, starring Robert Taylor, Brian Donlevy, and Charles Laughton, and featuring Walter Brennan. Suggested by a story by Laurence Kirk, and with an original story by Captain Harvey Haislip and R. C. Sherriff, the film's screenplay was written by George Bruce, John L. Balderston, and Herman J. Mankiewicz.
Plot.
During World War II, well-connected, Harvard-educated Lieutenant Gregg Masterman (Robert Taylor) enjoys his cushy posting as junior aide to Rear Admiral Stephen "Old Ironpants" Thomas (Charles Laughton), playing tennis and arranging social events. During a chance encounter, he gives bad advice to up-from-the-ranks Lieutenant Commander Martin J. Roberts (Brian Donlevy) out of spite. As a result, Thomas gives Roberts command of an obsolete, World War I-vintage destroyer, the "Warren". To his dismay however, Masterman finds himself assigned by Thomas as Roberts' new executive officer. When Masterman learns that Henry Johnson (Walter Brennan), the ship's civilian caretaker, was a member of the "Warren"'s original crew, he helps him reenlist and serve aboard his beloved ship.
Despite his awkward beginning, Masterman begins to turn into an effective officer under Roberts' tutelage, though Roberts has to constantly remind him that he cannot put the welfare of one person over that of the mission. On their way to rendezvous with a convoy commanded by Thomas, they are attacked by a Japanese airplane. Then, Johnson sustains a serious head injury during a storm, leaving him delirious and believing he is back in World War I. Finally, they rescue two pregnant women and 20 babies, survivors of a torpedoed ship. For comic relief, the crewmen (especially Masterman) have to deal with their unusual passengers. One woman gives birth just before they sight the convoy.
An aircraft hit cripples Thomas's flagship, damaging the steering mechanism. Thus, when a Japanese battleship sights the convoy, it is all up to the "Warren". Roberts informs Masterman of his plan of attack. He intends to set up a smoke screen, hide behind it, and then emerge to launch a torpedo salvo. When the captain is injured, Masterman assumes command. During the battle, Johnson takes over the helm when a crewman is knocked out. It takes two attempts, but the "Warren" sinks the enemy.

Cast notes
Production, release, and reception.
A number of titles were considered for the film which became "Stand By for Action", including "Cargo of Innocence" – the name under which the film was released in the United Kingdom, "A Cargo of Innocents", "Men O'War", "Clear for Action", "Navy Convoy", "This Man's Navy", and "Pacific Task Force". Although film was shot in Hollywood, it was originally scheduled to be filmed in late 1941 at the MGM studio in England, with Clarence Brown directing Robert Donat and Edmund Gwenn, but production was shifted to California because of the war situation. The original intention was that the film would be about the British Nazy in the Atlantic Ocean, but after the U.S. entered the war, the story was changed to focus on the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, the first naval war film made by MGM.
The film premiered on New Year's Eve 1941 in a number of cities, including Boston, Providence, Rhode Island, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Norfolk, Virginia, San Diego, California, and San Francisco, but MGM had previously screened the film for naval officers on bases in California.
The critical response to the film was not good, with the reviewer for "Yank" magazine saying that the film was "not about The War, but about Hollywood's War," and other reviewers comparing it to "In Which We Serve", the 1942 British naval film written by and starring Noël Coward and directed by Coward and David Lean, with the earlier film being deemed superior. Bosley Crowther, the film critic for the "New York Times", thought that Charles Laughton's performance was not his best, an opinion that Laughton himself agreed with, saying that it was like something out of "H.M.S. Pinafore". Despite the poor reviews, "Stand By for Action" was successful at the box office. It earned $2,013,000 in the US and Canada and $1,185,000 elsewhere making MGM a profit of $786,000.
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Special Effects (A. Arnold Gillespie, Donald Jahraus, Michael Steinore).

Heidi 4 Paws

Heidi 4 Paws is a feature-length children's film that retells the classic story of Heidi using dogs in all the acting roles. "Heidi 4 Paws" was syndicated to public television stations in the United States through American Public Television and WTTW Chicago in November/December 2008. 
Based on the story of the little Swiss orphan by Johanna Spyri, "Heidi 4 Paws" closely follows the original 1880 best-selling novel, but with a canine twist. The young Heidi is sent to live with her reclusive Grandfather high in the Alps. Just as Heidi adjusts to her new life in the mountains, she is taken away by her social worker. Heidi finds herself living in the big city with Clara Sesehound, who has been made an invalid after a debilitating illness. Although Heidi comes to love Clara, her quest to return to the mountains dominates her stay. In the end, she is able to reunite with her beloved Grandfather. When Clara later comes to visit, she miraculously regains her ability to walk.
"Heidi 4 Paws" is the first in an intended series of eight films that retell classic stories with live action dogs playing all the roles.
Origins.
Inspired by the 1930s MGM shorts, "Barkies", children's television series such as "Wishbone", and the family film "Babe", writer/director Holly Goldberg Sloan ("Angels in the Infield", and "The Big Green") created the 4 Paws brand as a way to revitalize classic literature for a new generation. 
Three partners, Tim Goldberg, Tim Ellis, and Chuck Sloan, joined forces to create Goldberg Sloan, and made "Heidi 4 Paws" independently, without financial support from a major studio. The film took over four years to make, and features a blend of live action photography, 3D animation and visual effects.
Other.
Sixteen different dogs have roles in the film. All but two of the sixteen dogs were rescue animals, coming from local animal shelters. Only the title role of Heidi, played by eight-week-old purebred yellow lab puppies, and an apricot poodle playing the butler Sebastian, were from breeders. The title character of Heidi was played by nine different puppies. Since the dogs grew as filming progressed, they were only able to work for a week at a time before they had outgrown their role and their costumes.

James Scollay Whitney

James Scollay Whitney (May 19, 1811 - October 24, 1878) was an American business executive and politician. He was the father of Henry Melville Whitney and William Collins Whitney, founders of the Whitney family business interests.
Whitney was born in 1811 in South Deerfield, Massachusetts, the son of Stephen Whitney, a merchant manufacturer. The family were descended from John Whitney (1590–1673) of London, who settled in 1635 at Watertown, Massachusetts.
In 1835, when he was only 24, Whitney was elected and commissioned brigadier general of the 2nd Brigade of the Massachusetts State Militia, which he was largely influential in reorganizing. Upon succeeding to the management of his father's manufacturing business in 1838, he moved it to Conway, Massachusetts, where he became a large manufacturer.
Whitney married Laurinda Collins, a descendant of William Bradford. The Whitneys were the parents of two sons and four daughters, of whom the following received historical mention:
A Jacksonian Democrat, Whitney was town clerk of Conway from 1843 to 1852. He represented Conway in the legislature of 1851, and in the same year he was appointed sheriff of Franklin County. In 1853 he was elected to the convention for the revision of the state constitution, in which he was prominent in the deliberations of the delegates. Whitney again represented Conway in the legislature of 1854.
In 1854 Whitney was appointed superintendent of the federal armory at Springfield, Massachusetts, by President Franklin Pierce, holding the position until 1860. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention of 1856, which nominated James Buchanan, and also that of 1860, which was wracked by sectional dissension before finally nominating Stephen A. Douglas. When Whitney left the Springfield Armory in 1860, President Buchanan appointed him collect of customs for the Port of Boston. He was removed, however, by the incoming Republican administration of Abraham Lincoln in 1861.
Whitney then went into business in Boston. In February 1866 he joined Boston interests in organizing the Metropolitan Steamship Company, of which he was elected president. His son Henry was named its agent at Boston. The company operated steamships between Boston and New York City on the "outside line" around Cape Cod. The line named the iron steamer "General Whitney" in his honor in 1873.
A member of the state senate from the 1st Norfolk District in 1872, Whitney was president of the Democratic State Convention of 1876, which nominated Charles Francis Adams for governor, and also that of 1878, which nominated Josiah G. Abbott for governor.
James S. Whitney died in Boston on October 24, 1878. He was succeeded as president of the Metropolitan Steamship Company by his son, Henry M. Whitney.

__NOTOC__
The Pastoral Greenhouse Gas Research Consortium (PGGRC) carries out research to find methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. The consortium, established in 2004, has a Memorandum of Understanding with the New Zealand Government. Almost half of the greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand are due to agriculture and since the New Zealand government has signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol methods are being sought to seek a reduction of these emissions.
In 2003 the Government attempted to impose an Agricultural emissions research levy on farmers to fund research into agricultural emissions reduction but it proved to be unpopular and the proposal was abandoned. The PGGRC is an alternative method of addressing agricultural emissions.
An independent review in 2006 found that the PGGRC was producing world-leading research and is excellent value for money.

Francisco Núñez de Pineda y Bascuñán (1607 - 1682) was a Chilean writer and soldier. 
He was born in Chillán Viejo, Biobío Region, Chile. In 1629 he participated in an expedition to defeat the Mapuche, but, during the Battle of Las Cangrejeras, he was taken prisoner by the cacique Maulicán, who kept him captive for seven months. After being released, he rose through the ranks to become commander of the fort of Boroa in 1654, and he was eventually appointed Maestro de Campo in 1656 by Governor of Chile Pedro Porter Casanate and had an important role in the Spanish victory in Conuco and the relief of the fort of Boroa. From his experiences among the Mapuches, he wrote in 1673, the chronicle "Cautiverio feliz y razón individual de las guerras dilatadas del reino de Chile" ("Happy Captivity and Reason for the Prolonged Wars of the Kingdom of Chile"), which constitutes one of the most important and realistic descriptions of the customs of the Mapuche people, as well as containing a defense of their rights.

Rivers and Harbors Bill

The Rivers and Harbors Bill was a bill passed by Congress in 1846 to provide $500,000 to improve rivers and harbors. When the Senate passed the Rivers and Harbors Bill 34 to 16 on July 24, 1846, opponents lobbied for a presidential veto. It was vetoed by President James K. Polk on August 3. The bill would have provided for federally funded internal improvements on small harbors, many of them on the Great Lakes. Polk believed that this was unconstitutional because the bill unfairly favored particular areas, including that which had no foreign trade.
Polk believed that these problems were local and not national. Polk feared that passing the Rivers and Harbors Bill would encourage legislators to compete for favors for their home districts, a type of political corruption that would spell doom to the virtue of the republic. In this regard he followed his hero, Andrew Jackson, who authored the Maysville Road veto in 1830 on similar grounds. Henry Clay and his Whig Party, by contrast, supported the bill because they believed the national government had a responsibility to promote trade commerce and economic modernization.
Southern Democrats in Congress overwhelmingly supported Polk's veto, which was condemned by politicians from both parties from the Great Lakes region. These areas saw the veto as an attempt by Southerners to slow down the rapid economic growth of the Midwest.

Bridge at Oinoanda

The Bridge at Oinoanda (or Oenoanda), or Bridge of Kemerarası, is an Ottoman arch bridge over the Xanthos river close to the Lycian site of Oinoanda in modern-day Turkey. It stands on or near the spot of a Roman bridge, whose existence became known in the 1990s through the find of an ancient bridge inscription.
Roman bridge.
Inscription stone.
The Latin inscription stone was found at the antique site at Kemerarası, which lies at the foot of the Oinoanda hill (Urluca). Since ancient times, the place has been an important junction of the upper Xanthos valley. The existing Ottoman bridge runs parallel to the modern highway bridge. Lying face upwards, and largely intact, the limestone block measures 130 cm high, 64 cm wide and c. 42 cm thick. At the right side of the front face, a medium-sized chip makes textual additions necessary. Further difficulties arise from a number of peculiar spelling mistakes, which leads to the assumption that the mason was probably a Greek speaker.
Dating.
The inscription, and thus also the construction of the bridge, are dated to the reign of the Roman governor in Lycia, Eprius Marcellus, who is known to have held the office in the year 54 AD. By comparing its contents with the known chronology, Milner dates the construction more precisely to 50 AD, making a connection with road building activities which started in the wake of the Roman annexation of Lycia seven years earlier under the supervision of Marcellus’ predecessor Quintus Vernanius. Probably, the Roman bridge should be understood as part of the Roman efforts to consolidate their hold onto the newly acquired province by improving the road system to move troops around more swiftly.

He is married, with two children.
Life in Canada.
After immigrating to Vancouver claiming to be a refugee in 1998, Dbouk allegedly operated a branch of Hezbollah in the city for nine months, raising $1,300,000, through credit card and banking scams, and spending the money on military equipment subsequently smuggled back into Lebanon with the help of his brother-in-law Ali Adham Amhaz.
He reported to procurement chief Haj Hassan al-Laqqis, and was responsible for shipping night vision goggles, GPS systems, stun guns, nitrogen cutters and laser range finders to Hezbollah. His "cell" also sought to obtain life insurance policies for Lebanese militants.
Believed to be a colleague of Imad Mughniyah based on a fax intercepted by Canadian authorities, he was the subject of a wiretap by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, who recorded him speaking to a colleague named Said about a Southern Lebanese man who might go for a "walk" soon and never return, and whether Said could serve as a reference to get him some necessary travel papers and documentation.
He was indicted, but believed to have fled to Lebanon. After his flight, childhood friend Said Harb took a companion up to Vancouver from their North Carolina home, and made a number of purchases of military equipment under the direction of Dbouk.

Third Addition to Rockville and Old St. Mary's Church and Cemetery

The Third Addition to Rockville and Old St. Mary's Church and Cemetery is a historic area located at Rockville, Montgomery County, Maryland. This area combines 19th century residential scale buildings with a tree-lined narrow street, country church, weathered headstones, Victorian Gothic railroad station, and a brick cast-iron front commercial structure, to create an atmosphere that evokes the era when the station served as the gateway to Rockville. In addition to Victorian Gothic, architectural styles used in residential buildings include Queen Anne, Georgian, and Colonial Revival. St. Mary's Church is significant as the County's first brick Roman Catholic church, and the handsome hardware store is the area's last surviving cast-iron brick commercial structure. The Old St. Mary's Church Cemetery is the final resting place of author F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda Fitzgerald.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Richard MacDonnell (scholar)

The Rev. Dr Richard MacDonnell LL.D., D.D., S.F.T.C.D. (1787–1867) was the Reformist 29th Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and the projector of Sorrento Terrace, Dalkey, which is today famous for being the most expensive row of houses in Ireland.
Family.
MacDonnel, of the Tynekill MacDonnells of Leinster, was the son of Robert MacDonnell (1764–1821) of High Park, nr Douglas, Co. Cork, and Susanna Nugent (1766–1836) of Ardmore, Co. Waterford, of the Cloncoskraine Nugents in the same county. For the most part of his life, his father had been a prosperous man. He had been given a lucrative revenue appointment at Cork by a close friend of his own father's – George Lowther – and had contemplated an early retirement on his substantial properties. But following the overthrow of Napoleon, property prices fell dramatically and he, like many others, died an impoverished and disappointed man.
In 1810, Richard MacDonnell married Jane Graves, daughter of the Very Rev. Richard Graves, and sister of Robert James Graves. They were the parents of fourteen children, including Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell and Major-General Arthur Robert MacDonnell. He was the uncle of Francis Brinkley and Richard Charles Mayne, and the uncle and guardian of Edmund Allen Meredith, the principal of McGill University in Montreal.
Trinity College, Dublin.
Educated at Trinity College, Dublin (1800–1805), elected a scholar in 1803. In 1808 he was elected a lay Fellow at Trinity which allowed him to practise at the Irish bar. He was awarded his LL.D. in 1813 but gave up a legal career in favour of taking holy orders the same year. The remainder of his career was spent at Trinity College, Dublin as a Senior Fellow of the College (1836–1852), Professor of Oratory (1816–1852) and 'an efficient' Bursar (1836–1844), bringing the accounts of the collegiate estates into satisfactory order. In 1852, George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, appointed him the 29th Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, succeeding Franc Sadleir and taking up residence at the Provost's House. He held the position for fifteen years until his death in 1867.
He was one of the very few, who from a very early date, advocated Catholic Emancipation, at a time when such views were very unpopular within Trinity. His broad vision and liberal views encompassed both politics and education, far more so than his contemporaries, and the significant changes he brought about are testament to his firmness of character. His period of office is remarkable for the number of new statutes brought in, despite the prejudice he encountered, which almost revolutionised the college code of laws, giving Trinity 'a fresh impetus in its career and usefulness'. Another source described him as 'clever but very lazy'. 
MacDonnell was said to have had 'an excellent dry sense of humour', demonstrated on one occasion when showing a lady around the impressive Trinity College Library, Dublin. She, clasping her hands together, exclaimed, 'Oh Mr. Provost, pray Mr. Provost, have you read "all" these books?', to which he replied, 'in time my dear lady, in time'. On another occasion, after the plates had been cleared between the courses of a dinner he was hosting, his butler quietly placed a sugar cube on his bald head. Engaging his guests on a serious subject, his parrot would by then have flown into the dining room and seated itself on the Provost's head to eat the sugar cube, as the Provost continued with his philosophical musings, giving the impression of being completely unfazed.
Sorrento Terrace, Dalkey.
MacDonnell had inherited Knocklyon House near Dalkey, but after his mother died there the previous year, in 1837 he leased it out and bought a plot of land by the sea front at Dalkey, where he built a new country retreat, Sorrento Cottage, now owned by The Edge of the Irish rock band U2. Named after Sorrento on the Bay of Naples, the allure of Sorrento Terrace is its situation and the breathtaking view across Killiney Bay to the Wicklow Mountains, the Great Sugar Loaf taking the place of Mount Vesuvius.
MacDonnell devised a plan for the construction of 22 houses right into the corner near the boundaries of the cottage, a huge undertaking at the time and one that never came to fruition due to the Irish Potatoe Famine, the family deciding to help those around them rather than themselves. In 1845 the family built the first and largest of the terrace residences, 'Sorrento House', and then MacDonnell leased the rest of the land to his son, Hercules Henry Graves MacDonnell, who built the remaining seven houses at a price of £1,000 each. The final house on what is now known as Sorrento Terrace was completed in 1874. The family stipulated that each house had to adhere strictly to the design of architects Frederick Darley and Nathaniel Montgomery. The houses today are known as 'millionaire's row', famous for being the most expensive row of houses in Ireland.

List of Copa Libertadores finals

The Copa Libertadores is a seasonal association football competition that was established in 1960. It begins in mid-February and ends with the finals in June or July of the same year. The Copa Libertadores is open to the league champions of CONMEBOL member associations; clubs finishing from second to fourth position in the stronger leagues of the region, such as the Brazilian league, are also included. Originally, only the champions of their respective national league could participate in the competition. However, in 1966 this was changed to allow the runners-up of the leagues to compete. The finals are contested over two legs, one at each participating club's stadium. Peñarol won the inaugural competition in 1960, defeating Olimpia.
Independiente hold the record for the most victories, with seven wins since the competition's inception. They have also won the competition the most times consecutively, winning it four times from 1972 to 1975. Boca Juniors are second with six wins; they won their last title in 2007. Peñarol are third with five wins, their most recent of which was in 1987. Peñarol have lost the most finals; each team has lost the final on five separate occasions. Overall, 24 different clubs have won the competition since its inception in 1960. Clubs from Argentina have won the most Copas Libertadores, with 22 wins among them. Brazilian teams are second with 17 victories, and Uruguayan clubs are third with 8 victories.

Out Come the Freaks

"Out Come the Freaks" is the name of a trilogy of songs by art-funk ensemble Was (Not Was). The trilogy consists of three songs that feature the same basic title, tune and chorus lyric: "Out Come the Freaks" (1981), "(Return to the Valley of) Out Come the Freaks" (1983), and "Out Come The Freaks" (1987) (later issued as "Out Come the Freaks (Again)".) 
Despite the three songs' abundant similarities, each song is distinctive, as differing lyrics in the verses of each song tell stories about different societal outcasts. As well, each recording had a different contemporary sound, a thoroughly different arrangement, and reworked the melody while still retaining the chorus vocal: "Woodwork squeaks, and out comes the freaks". 
Recordings.
"Out Come the Freaks" (1981).
The original recording was the opening song on the groups début album "Was (Not Was)". This version began with the chorus chanted several times simultaneously by a number of vocalists before the rhythm section is introduced. The single became a club hit in the US and peaked at #16 on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play Chart.
The song's parent album was later renamed "Out Come The Freaks" when it was remastered and expanded in 2004. A companion remix album is titled "(The) Woodwork Squeaks".
"(Return to the Valley of) Out Come the Freaks" (1983).
The second recording is slower and sparser as oppose to the post-disco sound of the original. This version is sung by Harry Bowens, who sings the "Woodwork Squeaks" chorus as more of a refrain than a chant. This version adds a new introductory verse which sets up the concept of the song. The final chorus replaces the words "the freaks" with a succession of song titles including "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" and "The Shadow of Your Smile", implying a more positive spin on the idea of a "freak" to counterpoint the earlier verses. "(Return to the Valley of) Out Come the Freaks" was the only single from "Born to Laugh at Tornadoes" to chart in the UK, and was also their first hit in that country, hitting the UK top 50.
"Out Come the Freaks (Again)" (1988).
The third "Out Come The Freaks" recording was released in 1987 and included on the group's most successful album "What Up, Dog?". It was eventually also released as one of the final singles from the album in the UK, and again peaked just inside the UK top 50. The song was listed as "Out Come the Freaks" on the album but reference to the songs reworked status was acknowledged in the inclusion of the subtitle 'Again' on the single's release. The single version was also alternatively titled "(Stuck Inside of Detroit With the) Out Come the Freaks (Again)".
This recording was once again dominated by the vocal of Harry Bowens, but a female vocalist sang the chorus refrain. The arrangement was more upbeat than the second recording but had a tighter Funk and Synth-Pop sound. The introductory verse was retained but the other verses were changed to feature different characters to the earlier versions. Instead of song titles, the more positive final chorus listed real people such as Leon Trotsky and John Coltrane.
"Look What's Back" (1990).
A fourth song related to "Out Come the Freaks" called "Look What's Back" appears as the final track on the group's fourth album "Are You Okay?" in 1990. The song is a 43 second acoustic camp-fire rendition in which the group chants the chorus: 'Woodwork squeaks, and out comes the freaks'.

Abroma augustum

Abroma augustum or Abroma augusta, Devil's cotton, is a species of "Abroma" (Malvaceae). It has dark red flowers with an characteristic and unusual appearance. It is widely distributed in Asia. It was previously thought to grow in north Queensland but the most recent survey did not find it.
The leaves and stems are covered with soft bristly hairs that are very irritating to the touch. The bark yields a jute-like fiber. 
Cultivation.
In the greenhouse, plants bloom from late spring to early summer. Dark maroon flowers are formed in terminal panicles. Individual flowers are up to 3 inches (7.5 cm) across. 
"Abroma augustum" needs full sun to partial shade with a rich well-drained soil mix. To grow indoors or in a greenhouse, use a mix consisting of 2 parts peat moss to 1 part loam to 2 parts sand or perlite. Plants should be watered and allowed to dry out slightly before watering again. They should be fertilized weekly during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer. They are very fast growing, so repotting should be done when they outgrow their containers. Extra care should be taken when repotting so as not to come in contact with the irritating hairs. Wrapping newspaper around the trunk helps to prevent exposure to the hairs while handling the plant. During the winter months, water should be somewhat restricted, but not to the point that the plant loses its leaves. 
"Abroma augustum" is propagated from seed. Seed germinate in 21-30 days at 72 °F (24 °C). 
Uses.
It is a medicinal plant with a wide variety of reported uses, including as an abortifacient and for treating uterine disorders, diabetes, rheumatic joint pain, headaches with sinusitis, dysmenorrhoea, gonorrhea, stomachache, diabetes and dermatitis.

1986 Philadelphia Eagles season

The 1986 Philadelphia Eagles season was their 54th in the league. The team was unable to improve upon their previous output win total of seven. Instead, the team finished with five wins, ten losses and one tie. This was the fifth consecutive season in which the team failed to qualify for the playoffs.
The season was coach Buddy Ryan's first with the team after serving as the defensive coordinator of the 1985 Chicago Bears, the team that won the Super Bowl in 1985.
Quarterback duties were split between 35-year old veteran Ron Jaworski (who started nine games in his final season with the team) and second-year quarterback Randall Cunningham. Veteran quarterback Matt Cavanaugh also started two games. The Eagles' passing game struggled, with the third-fewest passing yards in the league (2,540), and the fewest yards-per-attempt (4.1).
The Eagles set dubious NFL records by giving up a record number of sacks (a still-standing NFL-record of 104) and yardage allowed on sacks (708). No other team in football history had ever given up more than 78 sacks or 554 yards on quarterback sacks.The team gave up three-or-more sacks in every single game of the 1986 season, the only team in NFL history to do so.
The lone highlights of the season came on the road. On October 5, the Birds entered Fulton County Stadium and shut out the previously-undefeated Atlanta Falcons, 16–0. then gained a comeback 33–27 OT win against the Raiders at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on November 30, the Eagles' first win over the club since the 1980 season and first-ever victory on the road against the Oakland/LA franchise.

Portugal was present at the Eurovision Song Contest 1986, held in Bergen, Norway. 
The Portuguese national final to select their entry, the "Festival RTP da Canção 1986", was held on 22 March at the Rádio e Televisão de Portugal Studios in Lisbon, and was hosted by Henrique Mendes and Maria Helena Fialho Gouveia, who hosted the very first Portuguese Contest in 1964. 
Mendes and Fialho Gouveia introduced and made light commentary on the songs, which were taped in advance for the television audience. Each television region in Portugal (Ponta Delgada, Funchal, Porto and Lisbon) submitted three songs for this year's Festival. An "expert" jury decided the winner, and only the placement of the top three songs were made public.
The winning entry was one of the songs from Lisbon, "Não sejas mau para mim," performed by Dora and composed by Guilherme Inês, Zé Da Ponte, and Luís Manuel de Oliveira Fernandes.
At Eurovision.
Dora was the twentieth and last performer on the night of the contest, following Finland. At the close of the voting the song had received 28 points, placing 14th in a field of 20 competing countries. Despite its low placing, it would be the highest rank Portugal would receive in the Contest between 1985 and 1991.

Kerry Watkins (born May 16, 1979 in LaPlace, Louisiana) is a retired professional Canadian football wide receiver who spent his entire eight-year career with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. He was named a CFL East All-Star in 2005, 2006 and 2008, and a CFL All-Star in 2005. Watkins won Grey Cup championships in 2009 and 2010 with the Alouettes. He played college football for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.
Professional career.
New England Patriots.
Following his college career, Watkins signed with the New England Patriots of the National Football League in May 2003. He was later released during the following August after spending training camp with the team.
Montreal Alouettes.
Watkins signed with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League in June 2004. He played in four of the first five games but missed the rest of the season due to a shoulder injury. In 2005, he recorded his first touchdown, his first 1000-yard receiving season and his first CFL All-star selection. He was part of the 2005 Alouettes' foursome of 1000-yard receivers, tying the record (set by the 2004 Alouettes receivers of Ben Cahoon with 1183 yards, Jeremaine Copeland with 1154 yards, Thyron Anderson with 1147 yards, and Kwame Cavil with 1090 yards) for most 1000-yard receivers on one team in a season. Kerry Watkins' 1364 yards receiving on the 2005 Alouettes team combined with the performance of Watkins' fellow Alouette receivers Terry Vaughn (1113 yards), Ben Cahoon (1067 yards), and Dave Stala (1037 yards) making the 2005 Alouettes only the second team in CFL history to have four receivers on one team reaching the 1000-yard receiving mark in one season.
Watkins' 2005 season was statistically his best, setting career highs in receptions (97), yardage (1,364) and longest reception (75 yards) while also scoring the second-most touchdowns in a season with nine. In 2008, Watkins scored ten touchdowns.
Watkins would go on to record five straight 1000-yard seasons between 2005 and 2009 while falling just short in 2010 with 970 after he missed five games due to injury. He won Grey Cup championships with the Alouettes in 2009 and 2010, making a critical 17-yard catch in the 2009 game to put the Alouettes in field goal range to kick the winning points. His 2011 season was curtailed due to injury where he only managed to catch 31 passes for 395 yards and three touchdowns. Nonetheless, he finished the season in second place on the Alouettes all-time receptions list at 515 catches, behind all-time franchise and CFL leader Ben Cahoon. Following the 2011 season, Watkins announced his retirement on January 31, 2012.

Elizabeth Heyert

Elizabeth Heyert (New York City, 1951) is an American photographer and author. She received her Masters Degree in photography and the history of photography from the Royal College of Art, London, where she studied with Bill Brandt. She is known for experimental portrait photography, most notably her trilogy "The Sleepers" (2003), "The Travelers" (2005), and "The Narcissists" (2008).
Heyert is the author of numerous books of and about photography including "The Glass-House Years" (Allanheld and Schram, 1979), "Metropolitan Places" (Viking Studio Books, 1989), "The Sleepers" (Sei Swann, 2003), and "The Travelers" (Scalo Verlag, 2006).
Career.
After shooting around the world for publications such as "The New York Times", "New York Magazine", "Vogue" and "British Vogue", "Elle Decor", and "Architectural Digest", and for clients including Ralph Lauren, Cartier, American Express, and Tiffany & Co. her successful career allowed her to close her commercial studio in 1999, to return to a more personal exploration of photography. She began "The Sleepers" with the idea of experimenting with unconventional forms of portrait photography. Within three years she was offered her first one-person show of these works, which opened at the Edwynn Houk gallery in New York, in January 2003.
"The Sleepers", a series of monumental toned black and white photographs of sleeping nudes, is a meditation on the mystical world of sleep and the emotional journey we travel in our unconscious state. Reviewing the exhibit "The New Yorker" wrote that the work: "conjures thoughts of human fragility and impermanence even if the sleepers have become heroic sculptures rising from a deep slumber." Sei Swann published a monograph of "The Sleepers", with an essay inspired by the works, written by the playwright John Guare, in January 2003.
Heyert's obsession with sleep and the unconscious led her inevitably to photograph "The Travelers", a series of large-scale color post-mortem portraits. The photographs stirred discussion and controversy when they were first exhibited in New York. The New York Times, in a feature article about the works, described these photographs as a "peek beneath the surface at the vibrant, living face beneath the mask of death." Scalo Verlag published her book, "The Travelers", in March 2006. At the end of the year Photo-Eye Magazine named "The Travelers" one of the best photography books of 2006.
The 30 x 40 inch photographs have been widely exhibited internationally: at the Musée de l'Élysée in Lausanne, Switzerland; at the Hayward Gallery in London; in Austria in "New Art/New York: Reflections of the Human Condition"; and in a solo museum show at the Malmo Museer in Sweden. In May 2007, 18 life size prints of "The Travelers" were exhibited on a small island in Naarden, The Netherlands, accessible only through an ancient stone tunnel, as part of an exhibition entitled" In Memoriam". The works have also been the subject of television programs by ARD Kulturweltspiegel in Germany and by TVE Spain, a National Public Radio program, and feature articles in "Sueddeutsche Zeitung", "El Mundo", in the Swiss publications "Le Temps" and "Femina", and "Vrij Nederland" among others.
Heyert's work has been extensively reviewed and discussed in leading international publications such as "The New York Times", the "Times" of London, "Le Monde", and "Stern" and in contemporary publications such as nest and Dazed and Confused. Her photographs are part of the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, as well as numerous private collections.
She has just completed the third part of her portrait trilogy, "The Narcissists", a series of life size, color triptychs, taken through a two-way mirror.

Bode's sensitivity integral

Bode's sensitivity integral, discovered by Hendrik Wade Bode, is a formula that quantifies some of the limitations in feedback control of linear parameter invariant systems. Let "L" be the loop transfer function and "S" be the sensitivity function. Then the following holds:
where formula_2 are the poles of "L" in the right half plane (unstable poles).
If "L" has at least two more poles than zeros, and has no poles in the right half plane (is stable), the equation simplifies to:
formula_3
This equality shows that if sensitivity to disturbance is suppressed at some frequency range, it is necessarily increased at some other range. This has been called the "waterbed effect."

<doc id="20156916" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20156916" title="Member check">
Member check

In qualitative research, a member check, also known as informant feedback or respondent validation, is a technique used by researchers to help improve the accuracy, credibility, validity, and transferability (also known as applicability, external validity, or fittingness) of a study. There are many subcategories of members checks, including; narrative accuracy checks, interpretive validity, descriptive validity, theoretical validity, and evaluative validity. In many member checks, the interpretation and report (or a portion of it) is given to members of the sample (informants) in order to check the authenticity of the work. Their comments serve as a check on the viability of the interpretation. 
Member checking can be done during the interview process, at the conclusion of the study, or both to increase the credibility and validity (statistics) of a qualitative study. The interviewer should strive to build rapport with the interviewee in order to obtain honest and open responses. During an interview, the researcher will restate or summarize information and then question the participant to determine accuracy. Member checks completed after a study are completed by sharing all of the findings with the participants involved. This allows participants to critically analyze the findings and comment on them. The participants either affirm that the summaries reflect their views, feelings, and experiences, or that they do not reflect these experiences. If the participants affirm the accuracy and completeness, then the study is said to have credibility. These member checks are not without fault, but serve to decrease the incidence of incorrect data and the incorrect interpretation of data. The overall goal of this process is to provide findings that are authentic, original and reliable.
Positive Aspects of Member-Checking.
Member checking provides an opportunity to understand and determine what the author intended to do through their actions. It gives them the ability to correct errors and challenge what are perceived as wrong interpretations. Member checking provides the opportunity to volunteer additional information which may be stimulated by the playing back process. Gets respondent on the record with their reports. Provides people that respond the opportunity to assess adequacy of data and preliminary results as well as to confirm particular aspects of the data. The ability to summarize the preliminary findings.The major problem with member checking however is that it relies on the assumption that there is a fixed truth of reality that can be accounted for by a researcher and can be confirmed by a respondent, which may not be true. In fact, member checks are not consistent with the philosophy of non positivistic qualitative research methods. See positivism for more information on philosophy of approach.
Interviewing and Member Checking.
There are two interview styles to promote discussion between interviewees and the interviewers during member checks. The first, Confrontation Style is only effective when there is a trusted, warm, and open relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee. This style promotes discussion empowering the interviewee to have confidence to "fight back" when his/her opinion is questioned. The second, Dialogue and Power, focuses on the inherent power struggle between the interviewer and the interviewee. Interviewers must be aware of this imbalance of power and promote discussion from the interviewee by valuing opinions and reinforcing equal collaboration between the two.
In an informal sense, member checks are carried out verbally throughout the conduct of fieldwork. The researcher constantly checks his or her understanding of the phenomenon by utilizing techniques such as paraphrasing and summarization for clarification. It is best to ask permission to visit the participant again at the time of the unstructured interview. Interviews are used as a way for the respondent to express their emotions and thoughts about their experiences and allow the interviewer to have a better understanding of a situation.
When the member check procedure is used in a sample of people who were not the original participants in the study, the procedure can be used to assess transferability. If the people who were not the original participants do not agree with the information, then the findings can be said to be biased or not transferable since transferability is the process of being able to apply the findings from one study to others in similar situations. A question to ask is whether the findings "ring true" in others' experiences.
It is critical to use member checking in qualitative research studies because these types of studies often involve interpretation. Thus, without allowing participants to validate the accuracy of their findings, one-sidedness will become a major concern. Since the most important issue in evaluating the rigor of qualitative research is trustworthiness, using the strategy of member checks, (along with other techniques such as independent audit, prolonged engagement, triangulation, peer debriefing), is critical to minimizing distortion. Prolonged engagement aids in the ability to detect and account for distortions that might be in the data. It also helps to become oriented to the situation so content is appreciated and the researcher builds trust. In general, member checks are a useful function in research, especially when there are questions about the adequacy of understanding based on limited time of exposure. Thus, a member check can serve to counterbalance concerns about whether engagement was sufficiently prolonged
Pertinent Questions.
Before you begin "member checking," consider and answer each of the following questions:
Advantages and Disadvantages of Member Checks.
Advantages.
The greatest advantage in a member check is that the researcher can verify the entirety and completeness of the findings, which is a measurable tool of the accuracy of the findings. 
Other Advantages:
Disadvantages.
There are multiple disadvantages related to member checks that may occur throughout the process.
Objections to Member Checks.
Many writers establish internal validity – truthfulness and representation of the reality of the participants - by showing that they have carried out a ‘member check’ as Lincoln and Guba (1985) suggest. However, some researchers disagree with the use of a member check. Many researchers have noted that when the essence of the participants' experiences are similar, their stories represent social reality. Accordingly, phenomenology (science) is defined as a philosophy or method of inquiry based on the premise that reality consists of objects and events as they are perceived or understood in human consciousness and not of anything independent of human consciousness.
In qualitative research, phenomenological methods are used to learn and construct the meaning of the human experience through intensive dialogue with persons who are living the experience. The researcher's goal is to explain the meaning of the experience to the participant. This is achieved through a dialogic process, which is more than a simple interview.
Therefore, in their opinion, a member check can adversely transform the data through the process of analysis and writing. Phenomenologists believe each individual has his/her own unique perspective, inhabits a social world, and recognizes others’ reality to some extent. They believe that for an account to have validity, its readers will have grasped not only the essence of the phenomenon but also understood something of the human condition they have in common with the participants-–intersubjective understanding.
Member Check Considerations.
Member checks by research participants are increasingly recommended in qualitative research. There are differences, however, in qualitative research that suggests member checks may need to be approached with caution. Although member checking has been used for verification of the results, it is not always a true verification strategy. Many methodologists caution against using member check as verification by defining what participants say to be correct because it may actually pose a threat to the validity instead. This is due to results of studies being combined, made neutral, and abstracted from other participants as well as investigators wanting to be more responsive to their participants and restrain some of their results. Ultimately this causes the researcher's study to be invalid. Many consider member checking to be the best method of establishing credibility, but one of the main drawbacks is the way in which the researcher views the research as being intended to generalize the findings. This may clash with the participant’s view that their account is specific and solely their experience. Due to the different views regarding interpretation of data, member checks may be better suited as being identified as a tool for error reduction, rather than a verification protocol.
Member checks can be used as a technique to evaluate the problems with the study process such as practical, theoretical, representational, and moral flaws to ensure the honesty of the research procedures. The process of a member check also is important in revealing missing information that should be addressed before concluding the study. This is a step of reevaluation within a study that allows for researchers to implement changes and conduct further interviews in areas where a study is weak. However, the responses received from participants may not always be accurate and should be carefully reviewed by researchers.
It is important for researchers to review responses in order to avoid altering sound data. Participants in a study may have knowledge of incomplete or incorrect information that leads to misinformed responses. Likewise, they may also respond falsely in order to avoid social judgment or societal views on the subject, despite anonymity. Participants’ responses may also stem from myth-based knowledge or delusional thinking (Douglas, 1976). When hypotheses are formed, researchers often have predictions on the outcome; therefore, it is vital that researchers avoid their own biases to data. Avoidance of bias can be aided by having separate researchers review the member check responses rather than by those who conducted the interviews. There are no clear-cut means of clearly avoiding incorrect participant feedback or researcher bias from tainting gathered research. However, if researchers can minimize these factors they can strengthen the external validity of their research. 
Although member checks are considered very beneficial to credibility of the study, there is not a lot of information or understanding on how member checks should be performed. In recent studies, two methods have been identified. The first is to send the transcripts or summaries are sent to the original participants to be confirmed. The second uses a member check group session with each group member being shown a summary of the analysis. Regardless of the method used to peer review or member check research it must be done to ensure quality research and improve upon the research being performed before it is submitted for publication and considered as a reliable study.

Commanded by Captain Henry Geddes, she escorted brig "Acteon" to New Orleans, carrying General James Wilkinson and his staff to that port. She then cruised in the West Indies, protecting American shipping from French cruisers and privateers during the Quasi-War with France. Operating in Commodore Silas Talbot’s squadron, she captured schooner "Cecilia" after a five-hour chase 28 May 1800. On 7 August she captured French letter of marque "Dorade".

<doc id="20156981" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20156981" title="Personality Assessment System">
Personality Assessment System

The Personality Assessment System (PAS) is a descriptive model of personality formulated by John W. Gittinger.
The system has been used by scientists in studying personality and by clinicians in clinical practice.
A major feature of the PAS is that a personality profile can be systematically interpreted from a set of
Wechsler Scales subtest scores.
The PAS has two aspects which distinguish it from other personality models. They are the use of
the Wechsler subtests, an objective test, to determine a personality and the use of a developmental model
in which the description of personality includes development through adolescence.
Krauskopf has proposed that differential aptitudes are the "cause" of personality differences. 
The reason is that people prefer to use aptitudes they feel they are better at than ones where they feel
weaker. Krauskopf calls this hypothesis "radical" because so little attention has been paid to the idea.
With this "radical hypothesis", the use of an intelligence test, the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale to obtain personality information makes sense.
Description.
This very brief description is based primarily on the most recently published description of
the PAS although there is no disagreement with other
descriptions.
The PAS is based on premises (among others) that behavior is determined by both heredity and 
environment and behavior is determined by an interacting system of traits. Furthermore, these
traits can be modified through learning to such an extent that some might be nearly opposite
to the original genetic direction. Gittinger's original formulation defines three primitive dimensions
to which must be added general ability level which is referred to in the PAS as Normal Level.
There is an additional dimension related to psychological energy. In the theory, gender and age
also affect the final personality description.
The first dimension is "Internalizer-Externalizer" which is an ability to manipulate internal stimuli
or symbols without being distracted by the external world. This is similar, but not identical, to
the familiar introversion-extroversion dimension. The internalizer relies more on his own
experience and internal landscape and is likely to be less active than externalizers. The externalizer
is dependent on input from the outside and is more dependent on relating for the sake of relating.
Gittinger called this the intellectual dimension.
The "Regulated-Flexible" dimension can be viewed by thinking of a regulated person as one who can
see details within a whole, but not the whole. The regulated person is more stimulus bound and less able to see the "big picture". The regulated person is more procedurally oriented and emotionally insulated. The flexible person is involved with relationships and has attention diverted from step by step procedures. In theory, the regulated person has a high sensory threshold which is therefore satisfied less often than
a flexible person. Gittinger called this the procedural dimension.
The "Role Adaptable-Role Uniform" dimension refers to a person's skill in meeting demands that 
others make of him. It is thus a social dimension. The behavior related to this dimension is generally without awareness. The adaptable person easily plays a variety of roles, being charming and moving easily in many different situations always making good first impressions. The role uniform person is able to handle
only a few social roles at best and is often said to be socially inept. The behavior is most apparent in new social situations, since the role uniform may comfortable and accepted in a very familiar situation. The role adaptive can suffer from making good first impressions and then not understanding the unrealistic expectations others place upon him. Gittinger called this the social dimension.
As the environment places demands upon a person to learn to compensate for weaknesses, the person may compensate to such an extent as to actually appear to have the opposite primitive trait. For example a primitive externalizer may compensate and appear more as an internalizer. However, there are differences between an uncompensated primitive
externalizer and a compensated internalizer. The compensated adjustment is a more tense adjustment and requires more rehearsal and more display of consistency. Also, a person who is compensated often reacts negatively to seeing their primitive trait displayed in others. A person may compensate in none, one, two or
all three dimensions. The PAS calls the adjustment including compensation the basic level.
The PAS defines an additional level of adjustment called the contact or surface level. 
At the surface level, there are four possible adjustments. A person who is not compensated may either become modified, that is, attempt to display the opposite of their primitive trait on the surface or they may remain completely uncompensated and unmodified, retaining their primitive trait. A person who is compensated at the basic level may revert towards their primitive trait on the surface (this is called a controlled adjustment) or continue to move towards the opposite (this is called a repressed adjustment).
A person makes adjustments in all three dimensions independently. For example, a person might
have a modified adjustment in one dimension, a controlled adjustment in another, and a repressed
adjustment in the third.
A key feature of the PAS is that the profile of a particular person may be derived from their scores
on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. The development of the PAS actually began when John Gittinger noticed certain behaviors which seemed to relate to subtest scores on the Wechsler. Over the years, as he observed many people, he developed the full theory and the method of translating Wechsler scores into PAS profiles. Many refinements in the method used to produce PAS profiles from Wechsler scores were made
with the 2001 method and one much older method the most extensively used by psychologists using the PAS.
Applications.
The PAS has been used for many applications over the years. A sample of applications include
education, career analysis, self-help, and intelligence gathering.
DuVivier discusses the importance of working with individual differences when 
analyzing college student success and drop-out rates with particular attention to avoiding drop-out.
She uses an "Impressionistic Model Analysis" based on the PAS.
Downs studied college students majoring in mathematics and mathematics education.
In the study, most students in both groups were primitive regulated, in fact, compensated regulated.
Pure mathematics majors tended to be primitive and basic role uniform whereas mathematics education majors tended to be primitive role adaptive.
Meyers studied several police forces and discovered that police tended to be either
primitive role adaptive or compensated role uniform people.
Wilton describes an entire toolbox of building life skills,
everything from child training to dealing with obnoxious people to building security. She bases her
work on her understanding of indidual differences which she credits foremost to John Gittinger and the
PAS.
DeForest describes the use of the PAS in two aspects of intelligence gathering in Vietnam. One use was to develop interrogation methods appropriate to the personality type of the
subject. According the DeForest's report of the work, Vietnamese were very similar to each other, especially at the primitive level, and this led to develop of a consistent method of interrogation.
The PAS was also used to identify personalities which were likely to remain loyal, as opposed to ones who would flip-flop according to who they were dealing with at the moment. This was used to select subjects from among captives or deserters to return to enemy locations to gather intelligence.
CIA connection.
John Gittinger, the developer of the PAS, worked as a psychologist for the Central Intelligence Agency during the time he developed the PAS. Early publications describing the PAS appeared in academic publications and did not mention Gittinger's employer. 
While the PAS has been used in many contexts such as education and clinical work, it was developed by John Gittinger who worked with a number of other CIA employees. Gittinger and his PAS work were related to a wide range of projects, some of which were part of the set of projects called MKULTRA. 
When there were Senate hearings on the MKULTRA project, Gittinger was a witness and identified as
a CIA psychologist.
The relationship of Gittinger, the PAS and MKULTRA is discussed by Marks in chapter 11 of his book
based upon examination of thousands of documents. Earlier articles on the PAS in professional and academic journals never mentioned John Gittinger's employer.
While Marks' book is critical of the CIA and the MKULTRA project, Marks reports of Gittinger's passion for his personality system and describes it quite thoroughly. Marks also reports that Gittinger was very concerned that Marks' 1974 article connecting Gittinger, the PAS, and the CIA would damage Gittinger's
professional career. Marks also reports that Gittinger was "humiliated" by the 1973 hearings saying Gittinger was interested in talking about his personality system, not the drug and sex scandals being pursued by the Senate committee. Note that Gittinger retired from government service in 1978.
The use of the PAS by a CIA psychologist in the field is described in DeForest's book. The book describes the work of a psychologist, Bill Todd (a pseudonym) in Vietnam.
Treverton says that this book "is one
for intelligence fans, not an assessment but a lively tale of a spymaster and his agents-"
Manning's review in the New York Times says,
"Orrin DeForest, the principal author of the book, certainly comes across as a disaffected C.I.A. person, and its contents are certainly self-serving. Whether the book is also misleading is difficult for someone outside the spook fraternity of hired dissemblers to ascertain. Nevertheless, "Slow Burn" has its virtues anyway."
Literature.
The PAS was developed primarily during the 1950s and 1960s with continued refinement since then.
Due to the uniqueness of the developer, John W. Gittinger, and the nature of John Gittinger's career,
the literature is somewhat unusual in two ways. First, while there are many journal articles published
about the PAS and research using the PAS, only a small number are authored or co-authored by John Gittinger.
Second, much research has been conducted which has not been published. Krauskopf and Suanders'
book
has the most thorough discussion of the theory of the PAS, how it relates to other theories in psychology, and of research concerning the PAS. This book has a very extensive bibliography of both research on the PAS itself and works using the PAS. Gittinger's
major work, a 1964 work called the PAS Atlas contains the most complete 
description of the wide range of possible personality profiles. The PAS Atlas was never formally published by Gittinger. A revised version, which improved readability and usability, was published in 1992.
Gittinger did publish two shorter descriptions of the PAS in academic journals with coauthor J. F. Winne in 1973.
An extensive summary of the relationship of the Wechsler and the PAS is available from Matarazzo
in chapter 14 (Personality and Related Correlates of the Wechsler Scales) of the standard reference on
the Wechsler.
The PAS and MBTI.
Krauskopf and Saunders discuss how the PAS relates to other differential
concepts.
Due to personal interactions at conferences, perhaps the relationship of
the MBTI
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator to the PAS has received more discussion and
thought than other comparisons. The two systems have relationships but
an individual's profile in one system is not readily derived from the
profile of the other.
Research and conference discussions suggest that
conscious choices as defined by preferences made on the MBTI questionnaire define an individual's MBTI profile. Similarity, choices in one's life-style define a person's PAS third or surface dimension.
In the PAS terms, the face one shows to the world is the result of an individual's conscious and unconscious screening process. Like the MBTI profile, the PAS surface dimension reflects who a person is or how he/she wants to be seen.
The MBTI and PAS diverge on the source of what goes into one's public persona. The first two dimensions of the PAS represent measurable, developmental interactions of Nature and Nurture at play in forming one's "basic" or core personality. Based on motivations emanating from the basic personality, the surface persona is the result of an individual's largely, but not entirely, conscious choices to maximize strengths and to minimize weaknesses. Once the individual's basic or core personality is formed, it is immutable. In contrast, the surface dimension is subject to subtle transformations through life experiences such as education, therapy, illness, trauma, and/or aging.
So, while both the MBTI and the third dimension of PAS result from conscious choices about the identity a person wishes to project, these respective models vary as to the sources governing the decisions going into the choice of one's public persona.

Jeremy Robert "Jim" Fox (born 19 September 1941) is a British modern pentathlete and Olympic champion.
Fox is one of the most influential figures in the development of the Modern Pentathlon in Britain. He won the British title record ten times and is the only British pentathlete to have competed in four Olympic Games. His fourth place in the individual event at Munich in 1972 was the best placing by a Briton up to that time and has only subsequently been matched by Richard Phelps in 1984. Fox made his Olympic début in 1964, when he placed 29th in the individual event, and in his second Olympic appearance in 1968 he improved to finish eighth.
After the 1968 Games, Fox, then a sergeant in the REME, announced his retirement but he was dissuaded by his coach, Ron Bright, and remained in the sport for another eight years. During that period he set a fine example to the tyros of the sport and following his final individual effort at the 1972 Olympics he won a team gold medal in Modern Pentathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, with Danny Nightingale and Adrian Parker.
Fox, who was later commissioned as a Captain in the REME, was first awarded the MBE and subsequently the OBE for his services to the sport.

Russell Spence

Russell Spence (born January 3, 1960 in Bradford, Yorkshire) was an English racing driver. He now runs a construction business in London.
Early career.
He first started in Hill climb events and moved into single seater racing in 1981 when he entered Formula Three. After a single Formula Three race, in the 1981 British Grand Prix support race, finishing 27th, Spence drop back to the junior ranks for the next season. In 1982, he was champion in the Donington Park Formula Ford 1600. His good form continued in 1983, winning the EFDA Townsend Thorsen European Formula Ford 2000 Championship. During 1983, he returned to Formula Three with Eddie Jordan Racing for a one-off outing in the European Championship.
Formula Three.
Come 1984, Spence had signed for Mint Engineering – Warmastyle Racing, for his first full season off British Formula Three, in their Ralt-Volkswagen RT3/84. By only the fourth round, his experience of racing in Europe paid dividends, by winning the Grote Prijs van Zolder, at Zolder. In a season dominated by Johnny Dumfries, Spence scored two more wins, with back-to-back races at Donington Park and Oulton Park. Although he was Dumfries closest rival for the title, Spence was pipped third place by Allen Berg.
Spence stayed in British Formula Three, in 1985 for another crack at the title with PMC Motorsport, abroad a Reynard-Volkswagen 853. He had a brilliant start to the season, winning four of the first six races, two at Thruxton, one at Silverstone as well as retaining the Grote Prijs van Zolder. By the mid-season break he led the standing by five points from Andy Wallace. However, the Reynard’s early season advantage had vanished, as the Ralt RT30 came on strong, winning all the remaining rounds. During this period, his team, PMC Motorsport folded, leaving him to quickly build another team, now using a Ralt RT30. Despite this, he was only two points adrift of the championship lead going into the final two rounds. With a DNF in at Zandvoort, and a 11th place at Silvestone, this saw Spence drop to third in the end-of-year standings.
Formula 3000.
He got a drive in the second year of the International Formula 3000 Series in 1986. This was very much thought of as the proving ground for drivers who wished to get a drive in Formula One, after replacing Formula Two. Driving for Eddie Jordan Racing part way of the season before switching to Onyx Racing, his first season was an unsuccessful one, with a best place finish of sixth at the Birmingham Superprix. In 1987, he drove for Murray Taylor Racing. After a poor start, he had a strong finish to the year, with two podiums in the final two races. A second place at Le Mans followed by a third place finish at Jarama, saw him finish the season in tenth place.
1988 was a terrible season for him. He drove for three different teams through the year, Team Ralt, Madgwick Motorsport and Onyx Racing, in three different cars. Despite entering all the rounds he only finished one race, with an eleventh place at Le Mans, he finished the season with no points. At the end of 1988, he retired from racing.
Birmingham Superprix Protest.
He is most famous in the Formula 3000 championship for an incident that took place during the 1988 Birmingham Superprix. During the first lap, German driver Volker Weidler spun his car, blocking the circuit and causing a traffic jam of other cars behind him. With the front of the field driving away, Spence was furious that the race was not being red flagged. When the marshalls tried to push his car round, he kept his foot on the brake pedal in protest. With the car unable to be pushed and Spence not getting out, a track side crane was used to hoist his car off the track. The crane lifted the car up in the air with him still inside, waving his arms around for the marshalls to put him back down.
Stateside.
Spence made his racing comeback in 1992, in the SCCA Toyota Atlantic Championship. Abroad a Reynard-Toyota 92H, sponsored by Virgin Airways, Spence won his first two races in the United States; at Miami and Phoneix. Adding a further victory at Watkins Glen in the sixth round, helped Spence to finish fourth in the final standing, earning him a total of US$43,625.
As this series supporting the Champ Cars, this should have assisted Spence upwards, however 1993 brought just two drives in Toyota Atlantics, not starting one nor finishing the other. 1984 was no better. In two outings for Euromotorsport, Spence at least finished; 4th place in the Monterey Sports Car Grand Prix, at Laguna Seca and 14th in an IMSA Supercar race in Phoenix.
BTCC.
After five year break, Spence returned to racing as an independent in the 1999 British Touring Car Championship in an ex-works Renault Laguna for Arena International. His time in the BTCC did not go well. The first part of the season was full of incidents, ending at the fifth meeting of the season at Oulton Park when he crashed the car over the catch fence at Lodge corner. After this, he was replaced in the team by 1991 champion Will Hoy. He ended the season eighteenth with three points.
Fraud conviction.
In November 2011, Spence was jailed for thirteen months for his part in a fraud relating to a chain of nine car washes.

Plot.
The story begins in the year 20XX. Oshaka School in Kamakuland is a world-renowned school where only those who are pure and clearheaded descendants of Priest Sanzo's clan may be admitted. The trio of villains firmly believe they are genuine descendants of Priest Sanzo's clan, although they are of uncertain lineage. They study hard to enter the school in spite of their repeated failure. One day, three intelligent children are called in by the principal and asked to find a set of missing copper plates scattered all over the world. The plates are to be used to complete a puzzle board, which will bring honor to the Oshaka School. The conversation is overheard by the trio of villain, and they decide to stop the youngsters.
The story is aimed at a more adult audience, with the female villain often losing her clothes during the story. Generally, the story parodies previous series, spoofing various recurring themes and set pieces, such as giant robots, good vs. evil, being a villain, transforming/upgrading existing machines to become much stronger, authorities, and the social life of working adults. The show was cancelled after twenty episodes because of very low audience rate.
The show's title is a play on the Japanese saying "Itadakimasu," said before beginning a meal.

Woodchipping in New Zealand

Woodchipping in New Zealand is one of the sectors of the forestry industry and it attracted controversy in the 1990s when native trees were used as a source for the chipping.
Wood chip exports.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry collates figures on quantities of wood chip exports.
Controversy.
Since the settlement of New Zealand by Māori and then by Europeans has seen a loss of 75% of the indigenous forest cover. With European settlement in the 19th century large areas were cleared for pastoral farming and for logging. The export wood chip industry was as the main cause of forest clearance on private land after 1970 and by the 1980s 95% of forest loss was due to wood chipping. The native forest were replanted with plantations of fast growing species such as "Pinus radiata".
After protests from environmentalists the exporting of wood chips from indigenous forests was stopped by the government in 1996.

Ron Rocco

Ron Rocco (born 1953) Born: Ft. Hood, Texas
Ron Rocco is an American artist living and working in New York City and Berlin, Germany. His work entails performance, mixed media installations and sculptural constructions employing a mix of found objects and prepared elements.
Fields of interest: Installation art, Photography, Printmaking, Sculpture, Performance, Video sculpture, Video Art
Early life and education.
As a child Ron Rocco traveled with his parents to Germany, where his father served as an American soldier in the post-war occupation army. The artist attributed his early experience with German culture as a defining element in the background to his interest in Europe and his sometimes social and political themes.
In the late 1950s and '60s Rocco grew up in the Bronx in New York City. His was an ethnically Italian neighborhood, surrounding Arthur Avenue, known as the Little Italy of the Bronx. The neighborhood scrap metal yards, inspired an early interest in working with metals, and a sense of the latent potential of found materials to evoke memory and associations. Rocco went on to study the visual arts at Purchase College, State University of New York, with classmates Jon Kessler and Fred Wilson, studying with sculptor Tal Streeter, photographer and musician John Cohen and printmaker Antonio Frasconi. Later he began graduate study at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at M.I.T. under the instruction of the German Group Zero artist, Otto Piene, filmmaker Ricky Leacock, and anthropologist Heather Lechtman. Here Mr. Rocco began projects, which would result in his Guggenheim, New York performance entitled "Zaroff’s Tale".
Early career.
Rocco's earliest work in sculpture grew out of an interest in the tension generated forms, made famous by the American artist, Kenneth Snelson and German architect, Frei Otto. Mr. Rocco’s work was based on arced segments of aluminum or wood, in constructions which displayed a balance between tensile and compressive forces, subject to the effects of gravity. 
His exploration of these structures appeared in the exhibition, "Models for Large Sculpture", presented at the Arnot Art Museum in Elmira, New York and later in a solo exhibition at Toronto's Galerie Danielli.
Rocco's work through a public commission from Festival Ithaca and the National Endowment for the Arts in 1977, resulted in "Altair", a matrix of arc segments and stainless steel cable, occupying an area of , suspended five stories above the city center in Ithaca, New York. "Meketra" a second large scale commission from this period was exhibited at Cornell University’s Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art.
Later work in tension sculptures and performance activities, employed string figures taken from Inuit and Oceanic sources; forms, which in their traditional context possessed a social facet, in the communication of communal beliefs and ritual.
Mr. Rocco used these as mechanisms for dialogue with his audience in performance works like "Zaroff's Tale" (Guggenheim Museum, New York), "A String form for Binding Nations" (United Nations, New York) and "Laser Sculpture Dance" (Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Ithaca, NY).
Work in performance and electronic media.
Building on earlier work at M.I.T.'s and Owego, New York’s Experimental Television Center, Rocco authored computer software to produce an early image processing system for video. This resulted in his 1985 collaboration with dance choreographer Mel Wong and The Mel Wong Dance Company. Together they presented, "Buddha Meets Einstein at the Great Wall" during an American tour and at New York's Asia Society. 
This presentation used dance in combination with pre-recorded and real-time computer/video image processing to explore varying perceptions of time from both an American and Asian viewpoint. It was a performance that New York Times dance critic, Jennifer Dunning called one of the most successful integrations of video imagery and modern dance.
At the time, Mr. Rocco clarified, "The formal concerns of movement in dance could accentuate the effects of my equipment on the flow of time, providing a suitable format for the beauty and complexity of this subtle video processor". This performance was funded by a 1984 Inter-Arts Grant from The National Endowment for the Arts and the Sony Corporation, and may well have been the first live, on-stage application of computer generated imagery for dance.
Other media projects in-residence at Canada’s Banff Center in Alberta, involved musician David Hykes, of The Harmonic Choir. Together they developed a computer assisted laser/video work, which generated kinetic cycles of visual phenomena from Mr. Hykes’s music. One such installation, provided real-time, graphic representation of sound, employing a laser scanner and a digitally processed, video feedback loop to create images that were abstract and strikingly calligraphic. This appeared in the work, "In Light of Sound", one of Mr. Rocco’s "Andro-Media Series" installations, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. The New York State Council on the Arts funded event in collaboration Mr. Hykes and his Harmonic Choir used the two thousand year old tradition of Mongolian overtone chanting, practiced by these musicians, to control the visual phenomena created by the system of scanning lasers, video displays and computer processor. 
Working in the later '90s, Mr. Rocco explored the potential of web based projects in works like "Rabinal Achi/Zapatista Port Action" of 1997, a collaboration with Ricardo Dominguez, for the M.I.T /List Center Gallery's exhibition PORT/Navigating Digital Culture, and "Communicating Vessels" with Dutch artist Arnold Schalks.
"Rabinal Achi/Zapatista Port Action", was a fusion of drama and social commentary into a work spanning eight hundred years of Mayan History. Eight broadcast events were produced (via Pseudo Media in New York), bringing together news clips, interviews and discussion groups from Chiapas, Mexico, and the U.S. along with Mayan theater, for the List Gallery exhibition and the Internet. "Rabinal Achi/Zapatista Port Action" was a composite work, and used a VRML bridge, to join live audio and video streams, chat groups and an enactment of the "Rabinal-Achi", a classic Mayan theater work of highland Guatemala.
"Communicating Vessels", was presented as a maritime contribution to the Snug Harbor Cultural Center's program in 1998. As a site specific and web based project located at the St. George terminal of the Staten Island Ferry, this project joined maritime subjects, navigation technology and historical documents to explored the relationship of Snug Harbor Cultural Center's past, as a home for retired seamen, to the present refuge for aged sailors in Sea Level, North Carolina. Through interviews with the residents of the North Carolina facility, "Communicating Vessels" presented the Atlantic Ocean as the connective element between the two locations via the Internet, using an information kiosk at the St. George site to present the web site, track ferry navigation via software provided by MapTech corporation, and to distribute newspapers and other publications. "Communicating Vessels", was funded by the Netherlands Consul to North America and CBK Centrum Bildende Kunst, Rotterdam.
Sculpture and European projects.
Resident in New York 1979-1989 on the Lower East Side and later in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Rocco’s sculptural work focused on New York Real Estate as a defining force in the life experiences of artists. 
Works like "A Poet Dies on 12th Street" and "Eviction Plan" stem from his experiences as a tenant organizer at this time, and document cases of murder and arson as side-products of these economic forces.
Focusing on the balance between the natural and man-made world, Mr. Rocco’s 1989, "Waterline Project" in Amsterdam, Netherlands was created for the Dutch foundation ArtGarden.
The project consisted of three outdoor sculptures in a park-like environment, and commented on the Dutch accomplishment of redefining natural boundaries between earth and sea. The project was produced with the joint support of The Netherlands-America Foundation, Art Matters, The New York Foundation for the Arts and The Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, Martin Air Holland, Regency Art Transfer of New York and the generous assistance of the Dutch Consulate to the United States and The Department of Cultural Affairs of the City of New York.
"The Horizon is Nothing More than the Limit of Our Sight", Mr. Rocco’s 1990 installation for the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York, in addressing the natural and man-made worlds used the horizon to defined a perceptual boundary. 
This installation implied the possibility of a new social awareness, by people sharing interests of greater ecological benefit. Confronting a video landscape, and traversing the maze of barriers which comprise this work, the spectator explores the conceptual limits, which isolate us from this awareness.
Other projects during Mr. Rocco’s later European residencies at Künstlerhaus Bethanien and Die KünstFabrik in Berlin, Germany as well as Kunst & Complex in Rotterdam, Netherlands, resulted in exhibitions in 1991-93. "The Berlin Project", fruit of his work at Künstlerhaus Bethanien’s International Studio Program, was a body of art works which identified distinct facets of Berlin's evolving social dynamic. The objects showcased, referenced the socialist realism found in eastern parts of the city, as well as commercial elements taken from the west. The project, part of which is housed in Berlin’s Berlinische Galerie, utilized images taken from the streets and transit system of the city, as well as historical references, to reveal the new rules in an economic struggle beginning in the city at that time.
"Private Parts", the product of his residency at Kunst & Complex in 1993, focused on self-examination, an examination defined as transcending the individual. This body of work, which delineated personal issues such as age, masculinity, and health, took on more global meaning, in the context of addressing questions of human frailty, genocide and social values during times of transition. In this body of work, Mr. Rocco often refers to elements of control and order, and environments bordering on social cataclysm, through images of sinking ships, deserted streets and disoriented swimmers. 
He identified this work, “functioning as a diary of thoughts and images, from a year of painful transformation in Europe, posting warnings of all that is at stake in the search for peace and unification in Europe”.
America.
Perhaps because of long periods in residence outside the United States, or due to his earlier experiences in opposition to the Vietnam War, Rocco began to articulate a new view of American culture. 
"Structures of Detention", an edition of photo-silk screen prints on bound editions of The New York Law Journal, document a social dynamic between crime and punishment. Houses of Detention and Federal Buildings in New York City, provide the counterpoint to court proceedings and records outlined within each page’s text. In these artworks there is a dialog established between the pages and these buildings, which provide an opportunity for social commentary and dark humor.
Other works like "The Pursuit Series", drawings made from television images of police activity and "30 Minutes" B & W photographs in an enlarged contact sheet format focus on an American fascination with representations of criminal behavior, policing, and criminal justice. 
Post 9/11 as the U.S. began its ventures into war in Iraq and Afghanistan, Rocco's work became more critical of the escalating violence. Works like "StarBlind" and "Bloody State" confronted the blind march to war and its aftermath. An installation work from the end of the decade "Bail Out" questioned the accounting that resulted in the rescue of Wall Street in a humorous work, which included an overturned accountant's ledger, the spilled cyphers, and a golden lined parachute with its requisite air blower. 
The installation "Shake Up!" from his 2010 New York exhibition at Dam Stuhltrager Gallery, curated by Lynn del Sol is an artwork addressing issues of environmental degradation and the reality of Global Warming. It records the moment of shock; the rude awakening after a turning point. "Shake Up!" is the moment after the earth moves and we find ourselves in a hostile new environment. It also symbolizes the hoped for heed of the 'wake up call' to humanity.

Alinja

Alinja (also known as "Alıncak"; ; , Yernjak) is a village and municipality in the Julfa Rayon of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan. It has a population of 634. The mausoleum and shrine of the Hurufi Fazlallah are located on a hillside overlooking the village. Qara Iskander, the ruler of Kara Koyunlu was murdered there in 1436 by his son Shah Kubad.
History.
The seventh century atlas, the "Ashkharhatsuyts", commonly attributed to Anania Shirakatsi, mentions Alinja by its Armenian name, Yernjak, describing it as the first canton of the Kingdom of Armenia's province of Syunik'. The ruins of the medieval Yernjak (or Ernjak) fortress, which dates from the 7th century, are located on a crag overlooking Alinja village. This fortress once controlled, and gave its name to, Yernjak province, which comprised the whole valley down to the Araks river. A separate Armenian tradition states that the province was named after Lady Yernjik, a member of the royal family of the Syunik' princes. The Armenian historian Stepanos Orbelian noted its formidable position, describing it as the "impossibly sturdy Yernjak."
The province belonged to the Arshakuni kings of Armenia until their kingdom was dissolved in 428 A.D. The Armenian king Smbat I Bagratuni captured the canton and the fortress from the Arabs, who had taken them in 698. However, the emir of Āzarbāijān, Yusuf Ibn Abi'l-Saj, put the fortress under siege for a year and captured it, awarding it to the Muslim emir of Goght'n. The long and arduous struggle between king Smbat and emir Yusuf ended at Yernjak, where the latter put the former to death in 914. However, by the end of the tenth century Yernjak was back in the hands of the princes of Syunik'. After the dissolution of the Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia in 1045, in the following centuries the region passed into the hands of external powers. It was taken by the Seljuks in the eleventh century, and by the Mongols in the thirteenth century. The fortress is assumed to have been razed by the forces of Nadir Shah. The district became part of the Russian Empire following the conclusion of the 1826-1828 Russo-Persian war. In 1921 it became a part of the Azerbaijan SSR.

Gülüstan, Nakhchivan

Gülüstan (known as Cuğa until 1999) is a village and municipality in the Julfa Rayon of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan. It has a population of 482 (as of 2005).
Culture and sights.
Gulustan Tomb.
The architectural monument of the Middle Ages near the village of Gulustan, Julfa region. The Gulustan tomb which was built under the influence of the Momuna Khatun Tomb at the beginning of the 13th century belongs to the tower shaped tombs group of Azerbaijan.
The twelve faced body of the tomb was built of red sandstone but the pedestal with the original structure (the corners are in form of the projected cubic) was built of the hewed stone. Despite of other tombs of Azerbaijan the vault of the Gulustan tomb is situated on the land surface (in the pedestal). The pedestal looks like the projected pyramid outside but inside is cylindrical. The projected pyramid which is square in plan (6.6 x 6.6 cm) turns to the right twelve faced in the upper part outside and twelve faced upper chamber is situated on it. The upper tent cover of the tomb was completely destroyed. In accordance with this to identify if the cover looked like a pyramid or conic form is very difficult. The tomb surfaces were decorated with the carving geometric ornaments and were framed with the decorative arches. Each face of the tower is completed with the arches, by means of salient forking. Inside the recesses were covered with the neaty designs as it exists in the tombs of Ajami Nakhchivani. When glanced at the designs in all twelve faces, it becomes clear that the succession existing here is completed by means of three kinds of geometric designs repeatedly. The joined part of the body with the stand, also the place passing to the dome, were encircled with the carved enforcement of stalactit shape. The assembling of the ornaments with other decorative elements and their connection give a rather more vivid and elastic image to the monument. The space structure of the Gulustan tomb is the unexampled speciemen on the basis of a square from the circle, from cubic capacity to conic and thus the artistic – technical solution of the symmetric systems pass to one another. As the wide spread area of these kinds of tombs is Anadolu, it is possible to regard the Gulustan tomb as the key indicator of the background unity of the central Azerbaijan and the tombs of the Anadolu Saljug. According to the symmetry between the architectural forms, cut and neatness of the designs the Gulustan tomb is differed from these stone tombs for its advantage.
Mineral water.
The Gulustan mineral water is in the bed of the Alinjachay (Alinja River), at 2.5 km distance from the village of Gulustan, in the territory of Julfa region. The mineral water is extracted from the well of 135 m in depth which was drilled in 1962. The water is carbonic aerated, less mineralized, hyrocarbonated with natrium-calcium-magnezium. It is of the same type of “Kislovodsk” (Russia) and “Sirab” (Babak) waters.
It is used in treatment of the gastroenteric diseases.

Michael Barimo

Michael A. Barimo (born 1985 in USA) is a pop singer and whistler
Biographical and career information.
Raised in Winter Park, Florida, Michael began his career as a singer and whistler as a child, performing with a boys' choir and touring as Amahl in Gian Carlo Menotti's one act opera "Amahl and the Night Visitors".
When he was three years old his aunt gave him a pet canary that supposedly inspired him to whistle.[http://www.smh.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2003/02/28/1046407752404.html] In the first grade, Michael was awarded "best whistler" of his class, foreshadowing what would come in his musical career. At the age of 11, Michael appeared on the Nickelodeon show "Figure It Out" and whistled an aria from Faust.
Michael won several of the national whistling competitions held by the IWC in Louisburg, North Carolina as a teen [http://www.whistlingiwc.com/history-page5.html]. Upon winning the grand title of World Champion at the Millennium Championship of Musical Whistling in Edmonton, Alberta in 1999, he began performing around the world, whistling operatic arias, particularly those with fast coloratura. His most well known whistled arias are: The Vengeance Aria (Mozart) The Jewel Song (Gounod) and Mercè Dilette Amiche (Verdi).
Michael Barimo attended Columbia College of Columbia University in New York City from 2002 to 2006, graduating with two B.A.'s in Italian Literature and Anthropology.

Tyrian shekel

Tyrian shekels (Tyrian tetradrachmas) were coins of Tyre, which in the Roman Empire took on an unusual role as the medium of payment for the Temple tax in Jerusalem, and subsequently gained notoriety as a likely mode of payment for Judas Iscariot. In the latest standard, which was also the one used for the temple tax, the coins bore the likeness of the Phoenician god Melqart or Baal, accepted as the Olympian Herakles by the Greeks and derided as Beelzebub by Jews in the time of the Seleucids, wearing the laurel reflecting his role in the Tyrian games and the ancient Olympic Games. They also bore the Greek inscription "ΤΥΡΟΥ ΙΕΡΑΣ ΚΑΙ ΑΣΥΛΟΥ", i.e. "of Tyre the holy and [city of refuge". The coins were the size of a modern Israeli half-shekel and were issued by Tyre, in that form, between 126 BC and 56 AD. Earlier Tyrian coins with the value of a tetradrachm, bearing various inscriptions and images, had been issued beginning in the latter half of the fifth century B.C. After the Roman Empire closed down the mint in Tyre, the Roman authorities allowed the Jewish rabbanim to continue minting Tyrian shekels in Palestine, but with the requirement that the coins should continue to bear the same image and text to avoid objections that the Jews were given autonomy. They were replaced by First Jewish Revolt coinage in 66 AD.
The Tyrian shekel weighed four Athenian drachmas, about 14 grams, more than earlier 11-gram Israeli shekels, but was regarded as the equivalent for religious duties at that time. Because Roman coinage was only 80% silver, the purer (94% or more) Tyrian shekels were required to pay the temple tax in Jerusalem. The money changers referenced in the New Testament Gospels (Matt. 21:12 and parallels) exchanged Tyrian shekels for common Roman currency.

Eddisbury by-election, 1929

The Eddisbury by-election, 1929 was a by-election held on 20 March 1929 for the British House of Commons constituency of Eddisbury.
Vacancy.
The election was triggered by the death of the sitting Unionist Member of Parliament (MP), Harry Barnston. He had been the MP here since re-gaining the seat from the Liberal at the January 1910 General Election.
History.
Eddisbury had been won by the Unionists at every election since the seat was created in 1885, with the exception of the Liberal landslide election of 1906, when the Liberal Arthur Stanley won the seat. The Liberals came closest to winning the seat back in 1923 when the Unionist majority was only 196 votes. At the previous General Election in 1924, the result was a comfortable Unionist win;
Candidates.
It was a straight fight between the Unionist, Lieutenant-Colonel Roderick George Fenwick-Palmer and the Liberal, Richard Russell, Labour having decided not to contest the seat. The Labour Party had a weak organisation in the constituency and rarely fought the seat. Russell, a 57 year-old local government Alderman on Birkenhead Town Council, had the advantage of having fought the seat at the two previous general elections and had been nursing the constituency. 37 year-old Fenwick Palmer (a descendant of Sir Robert Peel) was Chairman of Wrexham Conservative Association so was new to most electors in the constituency, although he was well known in Cheshire hunting circles.
Campaign.
On 1 March, nationally, Liberal leader, David Lloyd George launched the Liberal programme for the upcoming General Election, titled "We Can Conquer Unemployment".
The main issues in the election concerned agriculture, and the controversial land programme of Liberal leader David Lloyd George. This was unsurprising given the essentially rural nature of the constituency.
Result.
The result was a Liberal gain from the Unionists. 
The Liberal victory in a seat not won since 1906, helped fuel speculation that the Liberal Party might win a General Election, expected within months.
Aftermath.
A couple of months later, Russell held the seat at the 1929 general election against the same Unionist opponent, with a slightly reduced majority;

Melody Fair is an album recorded by Lulu in 1970 for a release on Atco Records. She had recorded her first album for Atco, "New Routes", in the fall of 1969 under the production auspices of top Atlantic Records execs Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin. Although "New Routes" had been a commercial disappointment, Wexler, Dowd and Mardin had Lulu record tracks for a follow-up album in March 1970 with virtually the same session personnel who had played on "New Routes", although the latter album had been recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio and the 1970 sessions were recorded at Criteria Studios in Miami.
The album's advance single "Hum a Song (From Your Heart)", co-credited to the Dixie Flyers and backed by the "New Routes" track "Where's Eddie", was issued in April 1970 to stall at #54 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. The track also fell short of the UK Top 50 despite a "Top of the Pops" performance broadcast on 18 June 1970.
Lulu completed recording for her upcoming album in May 1970 and after a further single release: the overlooked "After the Feeling is Gone", that June the "Melody Fair" album was issued in July 1970 with no significant commercial impact. A further single release, comprising the tracks "Melody Fair" and "To the Other Woman (I'm the Other Woman)", had an overlooked release that September.
Lulu began a third album at Criteria Studios in November 1970 but the project was not completed. Although she would remain contracted to Atco until 1972, she would have no further album releases on the label with only occasional overlooked singles. The tracks from "New Routes" and "Melody Fair" augmented by hers singles-only releases and previously unissued material, were released in 2007 as "Lulu: the Atco Sessions, 1969 - 1972".

"Song of the South" is a song written by Bob McDill. First recorded by American country music artist Bobby Bare on his 1980 album "Drunk & Crazy", a version by Johnny Russell reached number 57 on the U.S. "Billboard" country chart in 1981. Another cover by Tom T. Hall and Earl Scruggs peaked at number 72 in 1982 from the album "Storyteller and the Banjo Man". A cover released in November 1988 by American country music group Alabama, from their album "Southern Star", reached number 1 on both the U.S. and Canadian country charts.
Content.
The song tells the story of a poor Southern cotton farm-family during the Great Depression. ""Cotton on the roadside, cotton in the ditch. We all picked the cotton but we never got rich."" ""Well, somebody told us Wall Street fell, but we was so poor that we couldn't tell."" The song references President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal in the line, ""The cotton was short and the weeds was tall, but Mr. Roosevelt's gonna save us all."" 
The father of the family is a Southern Democrat; ""Daddy was a veteran, a southern democrat. They oughta get a rich man to vote like that."" The family loses the farm after the mother becomes ill. ""The county got the farm and they moved to town."" In the end, the family ends up living comfortably well, having sought a life in a more urban location; ""Well, papa got a job with the TVA, we bought a washing machine, and then a Chevrolet.""
Music video.
The music video, directed by Steve Boyle, consists mainly of black-and-white photos and footage of the South during the 1930s, as well as footage of members of the band and other actors in the South, which is also in black and white, to give the illusion that it was the 1930s when it was filmed. The content of the video mainly follows the song lyrics, such as the footage of President Roosevelt during the lines in the song where he is referenced. The video turns to color during the chorus, showing a large crowd fronted by the band members marching down the street of a small town. At the end, the video is also in color and shows Alabama playing at a concert, at the end of which random people come onto the stage.

<doc id="20157611" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20157611" title="Bagà">
Bagà

Bagà is a municipality located in the comarca of Berguedà, in Catalonia. 
Traditionally, Bagà is considered the capital of "Alt Berguedà", the mountainous northern half of the comarca.
Location.
Bagà is located at the head of the valley of the Llobregat river, at the feet of the high mountains of the Cadí range. The town itself is at 785 metres above sea level.
Bagà is 20 kilometers to the north of Berga, and 7.5 kilometers to the south of the "Túnel del Cadí", a tunnel which crosses the Cadí range, connecting with the region of la Cerdanya.
History.
Bagà was founded in the 9th century A.D. when the region of Berguedà was repopulated by Wilfred the Hairy. The noble family of Pinós dominated most of "Alt Berguedà" throughout most of the Middle Ages and administered its domains from the town of Bagà, giving the town some importance.
The town was redesigned in the 13th century by Galceran IV de Pinós, and is a rare example of medieval city planning. The town grew rapidly and by the beginning of the 14th century a new neighbourhood had to be built outside of the town's walls to accommodate its growing population. Bagà was also granted a weekly market (which continues to this day) consolidating its role as a regional capital.
As a curiosity, some medieval documents refer to a “Hugo of Bagà” being the founder of the Knights Templar, though this is uncertain.
Population.
The population of Bagà has increased in recent years primarily due to an influx of people from the smaller towns surrounding it.
Economy.
The economy of Bagà once centered around the textile industry and mining. These industries provided the basis for the economy in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Since the collapse of these industries, the region’s economy has focused on rural tourism, as well as winter sports tourists filtered from the nearby region of Cerdanya
The "Fia-faia".
The "Fia-faia" is a celebration of the winter solstice dating from pre-Christian times which takes place in Bagà every Christmas Eve. A bonfire is set in the mountains to the west of the town, where the sun sets. After dark, inhabitants of the town set "faies", or bundles of "Cephalaria leucanta" alight and carry them from the bonfire to the central square of the town, where they are left on the ground. Children then jump over the fires, singing “Fia-faia, Fia-faia, que nostro senyor ha nascut a la palla”, or ‘Fia-faia, for our Lord is born in the hay’. Afterwards, bread is toasted over the fires and eaten with all i oli or quince paste.

<doc id="20157632" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20157632" title="Victoria Memorial (India)">
Victoria Memorial (India)

The Victoria Memorial (Victoria Memorial Hall) is a large marble building in Kolkata (Calcutta), West Bengal, India which was built between 1906 and 1921. It is dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria (1819–1901) and is now a museum and tourist destination under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture. The Memorial lies on the "Maidan" (grounds) by the bank of the Hooghly river, near Jawaharlal Nehru road.
History.
In January 1901, on the death of Queen Victoria, Lord Curzon (1, Viceroy of India, suggested the creation of a fitting memorial. He proposed the construction of a grand building with a museum and gardens.
Curzon said,
The Prince of Wales, later King George V, laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906 and it was formally opened to the public in 1921. Thus, the Victoria Memorial was built in what would be a provincial city rather than a capital.
Finance.
The Victoria Memorial was funded by the states of India, individuals of the British Raj and the British government in London. The princes and the people of India responded to Curzon's suggestion. Of the ten million rupees (one crore) in funds for the project, five hundred thousand rupees (five lakhs) were donated.
Design.
The Victoria Memorial's architect was William Emerson (1843–1924), president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. The design is in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style. This style uses a mixture of British and Mughal elements as well as Venetian, Egyptian, Deccani and Islamic architectural influences. The building is by and rises to a height of . It is constructed of white Makrana marble.
The gardens of the Victoria Memorial were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain. Emerson's assistant, Vincent J. Esch designed the bridge of the north aspect and the garden gates.
William Emerson.
Emerson was a pupil of William Burges and an architectural theorist. He first visited India in about 1860. Emerson designed the Crawford Market, Mumbai (1865); the All Saints Cathedral, Allahabad (1871); and Muir College (1873) Emerson moved to the princely state of Bhavnagar, Gujrat and designed the Takhtsingji Hospital and the Nilambagh Palace. There, he learned to include Hindu architectural elements in his works.
Vincent J. Esch.
In 1899, Esch was appointed assistant engineer at the Bengal Nagpur Railway, a job which gave him much practical experience in large-scale construction and costings. In 1902, Emerson engaged Esch to sketch his original design for the Victoria Memorial. After designing the temporary exhibition building for the Delhi Durbar of 1903, Curzon found Esch to be a suitable assistant for Emerson. Esch had also won a competition to design the Bengal Club building at Chowringhee and the Bengal-Napur Railway head office building at Garden Reach.
Construction.
The construction of the Victoria Memorial was delayed by Curzon's departure from India in 1905 with a subsequent loss of local enthusiasm for the project and by the need for testing of the foundations. The Victoria Memorial's foundation stone was set in 1906 and the building opened in 1921. The work of construction was entrusted to Messrs. Martin & Co. of Calcutta. Work on the superstructure began in 1910. After 1947, when India gained independence, additions were made.
External decorative features.
Atop the central dome of the Victoria Memorial is the figure of the Angel of Victory. Surrounding the dome are allegorical sculptures including "Art", "Architecture", "Justice", and "Charity" and above the North Porch are "Motherhood", "Prudence" and "Learning".
Taj Mahal.
Emerson may not have taken, literally, from the Taj Mahal but there is a reminiscence. Like the Taj Mahal, the Victoria Memorial is built of white Makrana marble and is a memorial to an empress. In design, it echos the Taj Mahal with its dome, four subsidiaries, octagonal domed chattris, high portals, terrace, and domed corner towers.
Exhibitions.
The Victoria Memorial has a number of galleries, 25 in all. These include the royal gallery, the national leaders gallery, the portrait gallery, central hall, the sculpture gallery, the arms and armoury gallery and the newer, Calcutta gallery. The Victoria Memorial has the largest single collection of the works of Thomas Daniell (1749–1840) and his nephew, William Daniell (1769–1837). The Victoria Memorial also has a collection of rare and antiquarian books such as the illustrated works of William Shakespeare, the "Arabian Nights" and the "Rubaiyat" by Omar Khayyam as well as books about kathak dance and thumri music by Wazid Ali Shah. However, the galleries and their exhibitions, the programmatic elements of the Memorial do not compete with the purely architectural spaces or voids.
Royal gallery.
The Royal Gallery displays a number of portraits of Victoria and Prince Albert and, paintings illustrating their lives, by Jansen and Winterhalter. The oil paintings are copies of those in London. They include Victoria receiving the sacrament at her coronation in Westminster Abbey (June 1838); Victoria's marriage to Albert in the Chapel Royal at St. James' Palace (1840); the christening of the Prince of Wales in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle (1842); the marriage of the Prince of Wales (Edward VII) to Princess Alexandra (1863); Victoria at the First Jubilee service at Westminster Abbey (1887) and the Second Jubilee service at St. Paul's Cathedral (June 1897). 
Victoria's childhood rosewood pianoforte and her correspondence desk from Windsor Castle stand in the centre of the room. Edward VII presented these items to the Victoria Memorial. On the south wall hangs the Russian artist, Vasily Vereshchagin's oil painting of the state entry of Edward VII, (then Prince of Wales), into Jaipur in 1876.
Calcutta gallery.
In the mid 1970s, the matter of a new gallery devoted to the visual history of Calcutta was promoted by Saiyid Nurul Hasan, the minister for education. In 1986, Hasan became the governor of West Bengal and chairman of the board of trustees of the Victoria Memorial. In November, 1988, Hasan hosted an international seminar on the "Historical perspectives for the Calcutta tercentenary". The Calcutta gallery concept was agreed and a design was developed leading to the opening of the gallery in 1992. The Calcutta gallery houses a visual display of the history and development of Calcutta from Job Charnock (1630–1692) of the English East India company to 1911, when the capital of India was transferred to New Delhi. The gallery also has a life size diorama of Chitpur road in the late 1800s.

Côte-Saint-Paul

Côte-Saint-Paul is a neighbourhood located in the Southwest Borough of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
History.
The concession of côte Saint-Paul was granted by the Sulpician Order, seigneurs of the Island of Montreal, in 1662. It extended northward from the current site past the current location of the Lachine Canal to Lac à la Loutre, which was then located at the foot of the Falaise Saint-Jacques, where the Turcot yards are today. The area was essentially agricultural, and remained so until the Lachine Canal bisected the area in 1825; Lac à la Loutre was dried out. Chemin de la Rivière-Saint-Pierre (now avenue de l'Église) was built to join Chemin de la Côte-des-Argoulets (Boulevard LaSalle) with the Chemin de la Côte-Saint-Paul (Rue Saint-Patrick).
With the canal providing water power for factories, workers started to move in nearby, forming the nucleus of the community in the triangle bounded by the Lachine Canal, Rue Angers, and Avenue de l'Église. The village of Côte-Saint-Paul was founded in 1874. The first Église Saint-Paul was built in 1875, and a town hall and railway station soon followed. The western part of the village separated in 1878, forming the Parish Municipality of Côte-Saint-Paul, later Ville-Émard. The balance of the village of Côte-Saint-Paul became a town in 1894 and was renamed Saint-Paul in 1897.
Clockwise from the north, the town of Saint-Paul was bounded by the Lachine Canal, the Grand Trunk Railway, the north bank of the Aqueduct Canal, the property line behind the lots on the west side of Frontenac Street (now Rue Leprohon), a property line just north of Rielle Street (now Rue Laurendeau), First Avenue (now Rue le Caron), and St. Louis Street (now Rue Briand).
In 1910, Saint-Paul merged into the city of Montreal at the same time as neighbouring Ville-Émard. Industrial development continued and the remaining agricultural lands were converted to housing. However, like the rest of the Lachine Canal area, the neighbourhood went into decline with the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The construction of the Décarie Expressway and the Turcot Interchange in 1964 tore through the heart of old Saint-Paul, though it spared the institutional buildings along Avenue de l'Église. In 1978, the Montreal Metro reached Côte-Saint-Paul with the construction of Jolicoeur metro station.
In 2002, the area became part of the borough of Le Sud-Ouest. Today, the western limit of the neighbourhood Côte-Saint-Paul is not precisely defined, but it is somewhat expanded to the west of the official limit in its days as an independent town, with the building-up of the agricultural land since then and the destruction of the town's centre.
Geography.
The neighbourhood is bordered to the south by Desmarchais Boulevard, to the west by Monk Boulevard, to east by the aqueduct, and to the north by the Lachine Canal and the railroad track bordering Pointe-Saint-Charles. Côte-Saint-Paul can be accessed by the "De La Vérendrye" exit on Quebec Autoroute 15.
Infrastructure.
The neighbourhood is served by the Jolicoeur Montreal Metro station. It is crossed and bordered by the Lachine Canal and the Aqueduct Canal.
Parc de La Vérendrye and Parc Saint-Paul offer recreation, and the Aqueduc and Lachine Canal bicycle paths are linked by a path through the Côte Saint-Paul industrial area east of the Décarie Expressway.

Accidental Friendship

Accidental Friendship is a 2008 Hallmark Channel original film written by Anna Sandor, an award-winning screenwriter. It is based on a true story.
Plot.
Homeless woman Yvonne Caldwell (Chandra Wilson) is a woman with good reason to be bitter: she has lost everything except her two beloved dogs, Bebe and Man-Man. With her one friend, Wes (Ben Vereen), Caldwell lives the daily struggle of being homeless in Los Angeles until a chance encounter caused by her dogs leads to a friendship with LAPD officer Tami Baumann (Kathleen Munroe), and hope for a better life begins in earnest for Yvonne. Friendship between the two women seemed improbable, but their friendship provided a base of support and respect for Yvonne and Tami for more than five years.
True story.
In real life, Yvonne Caldwell met Officer Tami Baumann, an officer at LAPD’s 77th Street Division, in 2003. It was Yvonne’s three dogs that caught Tami’s attention, and the overwhelming care she took of the strays. Tami, who was well known in the department for her love of animals – and who had been finding homes for strays since she was a child – used this connection to form a bond with Yvonne.
Over time, Yvonne began to open up to Tami, relating her gradual fall into poverty, a tale of struggling with abuse and abandonment which led to a long battle with alcoholism. By mid-2001, her prized SUV was her home and only possession, but that too was taken from her when she couldn’t afford the fees to release it from impound after it was stolen. Fortunately, Tami was eventually able to convince Yvonne to enter rehab and embark on a program designed to save her life.
Critical reception.
The film was generally well-received by critics. "Variety" stated that the director "doesn't stoop to the usual gimmicks," and called the script "thoughtful." They also thought the story was "simple" and "meaningful," and said it was "more of a character study than a message movie." 
Marilyn Moss of "The Hollywood Reporter" gave it a milder review, stating that the film "stretches it a bit in the sentimental category," but still "holds a grip without too much effort," yet at the same time "there is hardly anything to set a spark." She also said, "When the corn doesn't get in the way of the story, this movie is believable and affecting." Chandra Wilson was praised for her portrayal as a "bitter"; Moss stated that "she easily takes hold of the frame whenever she's in it." 
Award nomination.
Chandra Wilson was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for her performance.

<doc id="20157891" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20157891" title="Development of Bugs Bunny">
Development of Bugs Bunny

The rabbit's first appearance was essentially the same as the early Daffy Duck. He appeared in four cartoons before finally becoming the well-known character of Bugs Bunny in Tex Avery's "A Wild Hare".
Several published first person accounts, encyclopedic references, and Warner Bros.' own published material describe the inception of the name and of the character. A model sheet by Charlie Thorson describes this prototype character as "Bugs' Bunny" (note the apostrophe) but in most of the cartoons the character is unnamed.
Virgil Ross, the animator for "A Wild Hare" describes how the character came to be named in the interview published by "Animato!" magazine #19. Mel Blanc often told the story of the creation of the character and its name. He suggested that the character be named after the character's initial director, Ben "Bugs" Hardaway. 
Blanc's own book, "That's Not All Folks" published by Warner Books in 1989, describes the "tough little stinker" that was the eventual version of the redesigned character as directed by Tex Avery.
Warner Brothers' own published descriptions of the creation of the character's name can be found in "Animation Magazine" published in 1990. Therein it is described that the Hardaway unit's model sheet came to be known by fellow animators as "Bugs' Bunny".
Character Evolution.
Porky's Hare Hunt.
Bob Clampett began the experiment in "Porky's Hare Hunt" which was "his story" as he described in the lengthy interview published in "Funnyworld Magazine", No 12, 1970. The interview was conducted by Michael Barrier and Milton Gray. It is posted on Mike Barrier's site In the cartoon Porky Pig is hunting and fires at several rabbits. Soon, Porky and his dog meet the rabbit and try to outwit him in the forest. Porky and the rabbit get in a long, long fight and soon the hare thinks he has won and that the war that is over; Porky, however, finds the rabbit and the Bunny doesn't have any brainstorms to protect him. The rabbit shows Porky a photo of himself and of how many children he has with his wife. However, when Porky's about to shoot him, the gun fails.
After Porky attempts to shoot down and procure the rabbit, the rabbit asks Porky: "Do you have a hunting license?" As Porky reaches for his pocket to obtain the document, the hyper-hare suddenly snatches it out of Porky's grasp, rips it in two, remarks, "Well you haven't got one now...hoohoohoohoohahahahah..hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha!" and makes a getaway by twisting his ears as though they were a helicopter propeller, flying away. Ultimately the rabbit wins when Porky throws dynamite into the cave in which the hare is hiding and the rabbit throws the dynamite back at him. Porky is in the hospital and the rabbit comes to him with some flowers. Porky tells the hare that he'll be out in a few days. The very hyper rabbit then pulls on the leg holders in Porky's bed, adding to the pig's injuries, and runs off into the forest.
Prest-O Change-O.
Leon Schlesinger gave Chuck Jones the next cartoon, "Prest-O Change-O". In this cartoon two rogue dogs are being pursued by a dog catcher until they hide in an abandoned house. There they encounter a trunk owned by Sham-Fu the magician (unseen). They open it, and all manner of magic tricks come out of the trunk, including his pet rabbit. The rabbit tricks the two dogs repeatedly, causing them endless frustration, until he is bested by the bigger of the two dogs, who bops him with a lampshade.
Hare-um Scare-um.
Leon got Hardaway/Dalton to direct the next one, "Hare-um Scare-um". It starts with a man reading a newspaper article stating that meat prices have soared (and that customers are sore). Angry, he declares that he'll hunt his own meat to get back at the government for the price inflation. He then tells his dog he is going hunting for rabbits. A rabbit lays a trap for the dog, the dog gets scared of the sound. The bunny then plays "Guess Who" with the dog, with the dog answering in barks. The hunter then sees rabbits, aims his gun, then runs over to where it was. When he gets there, there is a spinning wheel with rabbit signs. The hunter then sees the hare sleeping. The hunter starts pouring salt on the rabbit's tail, but the rabbit quickly changes position so that the hunter is salting a celery stalk instead. The rabbit starts eating it and says, "Celery, mighty fine nerve tonic. Boy, have I got nerve." The hare runs in a cave, and the hunter runs after him. Before he reaches the cave, an elevator appears and the hunter collides with it. The rabbit then opens it and says, "Main floor, leather goods, pottery, washing machines and aspirin, going up!" and closes it as the elevator goes up. The elevator floor goes back down, the hare opens it and says, "You don't have to be crazy to do this … but it sure helps," closes it and the elevator goes down. The bunny then dresses in girl-dog drag. The dog then sees the rabbit in drag; he thinks it's a dog, then he notices it's the rabbit. The hare then pretends he's a policeman. He then sings the same song as below. The hunter then finds the rabbit. He explains to the hunter how poor he is. He then shocks the hunter, who falls to the ground. The hunter then tells the now-hiding hare he can whip the rabbit and his whole family, then he's suddenly surrounded by a lot of rabbits that look like the first rabbit.
Jones' "Elmer and rabbit" cartoons.
Jones directed the next experimental cartoon, "Elmer's Candid Camera". In this cartoon, Elmer has come to the country to photograph wildlife. As he tries to photograph a rabbit, the rabbit finds him a convenient victim to harass. This tormenting eventually drives Elmer insane, causing him to jump into a lake and nearly drown. The rabbit saves him, ensures that Elmer is all right now - and then kicks him straight back into the lake.
This was followed by Tex Avery's final-design setting "A Wild Hare", but that was itself followed by one more cartoon to the same effect as "...Camera", that was inadvertably produced first before the former. "Elmer's Pet Rabbit", originally intended and meant to be the final experimental cartoon, bore a title card shoehorned in between the opening credits and the start of the story reading, "Starring Bugs Bunny" (the first on-screen use of that name), but nevertheless featured the same initial off-model versions of Elmer and the hare seen in "...Camera". Here, Elmer goes to a pet shop and buys a rabbit that promptly proceeds to turn his life upside down.
Bugs arrives.
"A Wild Hare" (July 27, 1940) was the debut of Bugs Bunny as we know him today. Tex Avery changed several of the rabbit's characteristics: his voice became a cross between the Bronx and Brooklyn accents, the color of his gloves became white, as did the color of his mouth, and his ears were changed slightly as well. It is worth noting, however, that "Patient Porky" (September 14, 1940) featured a cameo by this prototype Bugs Bunny.
The cartoon was so successful that WB decided to keep him on as a recurring character, eventually becoming the studio's most popular cartoon character. The character's name, previously only used on model sheets, became the official all-purpose name as well, with one modification: the apostrophe was dropped from his first name (now pronounced "bugs" rather than "bugs-es"). A title card saying "featuring Bugs Bunny" was slapped onto "Elmer's Pet Rabbit" after initial production of that cartoon wrapped up, though that cartoon had the rabbit carry the pre-"Wild Hare" characteristics.
Bugs Bunny's personality continued to evolve over the years, from a largely "screwball" character (a la Daffy Duck), to a mixture of "screwball" and "everyman" characteristics. His definitive design was created in 1943 by Bob Clampett, and would be adopted by each unit slowly (though Chuck Jones had a slight variation). Bugs' look was slightly modified again for the 2011 series "The Looney Tunes Show".

Roy John

William Ronald "Roy" John (29 January 1911 – 12 July 1973) was a Welsh international footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Manchester United, Newport County, Sheffield United, Stoke City, Swansea Town and Walsall as well as the Wales national team.
Football career.
Born in Briton Ferry, John began his career with Briton Ferry Athletic before joining Swansea Town in 1927. At this time he was an outfield player, originally a full-back (where he was "not greatly appreciated") before initially moving forward to play as a half-back, where he gained a reputation as "a resolute tackler with a useful kick". He left Swansea in May 1928, having not played a Football League game for them. 
He then joined Walsall, where he played for the reserve side as a half-back. Following the departure of Fred Biddlestone to Aston Villa in January 1930 and an injury to the reserve goalkeeper, manager Sid Scholey asked John to try out for the custodian's shirt. John did so well in a practice match that he was quickly promoted to first-team goalkeeper. Within months he made his international debut, when he played for Wales against Ireland on 22 April 1931. His debut match ended in a 3–2 victory to the Welsh. One writer of the time described him as "dashing and daring – a gay cavalier who laughs fortune in the face".
After 88 league games for Walsall, he was transferred to Stoke City in April 1932, where he was part of the team which won the Football League Second Division title in 1932–33. The local media described John's performances during that season as "simply brilliant". He struggled though in the First Division and was sold to Preston in the summer of 1934. After six months at Preston North End, John moved to Sheffield United in December 1934, for a transfer fee of £1,250. He made 29 League appearances for the Blades, before he was sold to Manchester United in June 1936, for a fee of £600. His debut for the club finished in a 1–1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers on 29 August 1936. He transferred to Newport County in March 1937, having made 15 appearances for United.
He moved back to Swansea Town four months after joining Newport. In 1938, he helped Swansea reach the final of the Welsh Cup, where they were defeated by Shrewsbury Town in a replay. He remained at the Vetch Field club until the Second World War cut his career short. He officially retired on 11 November 1939, when he became a hotel manager.
During the war, John guested for several clubs in the north-west of England, including Southport, and in September 1942 he played for a Wales XI against the R.A.F.
International career.
John made 14 appearances for Wales in full internationals, helping Wales win the British Home Championship in 1933 and 1934. During his time as the Wales goalkeeper, he alternated with Bert Gray and Len Evans.

Society Burning

Society Burning is a coldwave industrial rock act composed of Daveoramma, Twitch, and Boom chr Paige. The group was originally founded in Las Cruces, New Mexico as a side project of Daveoramma’s in 1991 by the moniker ‘The Watchmen’ (a tribute to the Alan Moore graphic novel).
History.
Shortly before the release of project’s first self produced work, Daveoramma brought on guitarist Boom chr Paige. They caught the attention of Chase of Cargo/Re-constriction records that same year. The band gained recognition via Usenet newsgroups and the nascent Internet, being one of the first acts to embrace the technology as a marketing vehicle.
The duo released another self produced work in 1992, gaining attention from Chase again, as well as German label Kugel Blitz. Both labels released compilations featuring the band, but the band was forced to change its name upon discovering another band already using their moniker. The resulting name ‘Society Burning’ (ripped from a quote from a Denver, Colorado newscast) was chosen in time for both record labels to use it on separate compilation appearances. During this time the band enlisted the help of Michael Smith of Fiction 8 for assistance with keyboards on-stage.
In 1993, the band met Steven Seibold of Hate Dept., who would go one to produce/re-engineer the song “Human Waste” for the Re-Constriction compilation ‘Thugs ‘n’ Kisses’. This would be the beginning of an odd precedent set by Re-Con and the band for ‘premixing’, or releasing the remixed material before releasing the original versions of their work.
In 1995, Society Burning signed to Re-Constriction. The following year, the label issued the premix cd "Entropy Lingua". In 1997, Re-Constriction issued the full-length album "Tactiq", of which Peter Scaruffi called "one of the most violent works" in the Nine-inch-Nails—KMFDM style category in his book "A History of Rock Music 1951-2000".
Over the next two years, the musicians worked mostly independently: Daveoramma worked with a cast of voices to bridge songs for the parody/tribute album Cyberpunk Fiction while Boom chr Paige worked as remixer for artists including Leæther Strip, Purr Machine, THD, Urania, Hexedene, and Battery. The band parted ways in 1999, following the closure of Re-Constriction. Daveoramma relocated to Los Angeles, California, Twitch remained in Denver, Colorado, and Boom chr Paige is currently located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The band regrouped 2007, writing material for a new release on their own Audiocomm International Publishing label in addition to finalizing and releasing their previously unreleased 1994 album "State of Decay" in late 2009. October 2010 saw the release of their sixth album "Internal Combustion".

The Takoma Avenue Historic District is a national historic district located at Takoma Park, Montgomery County, Maryland. All five houses were constructed in 1951, are identical in their layout and construction, and were designed by Charles M. Goodman. In Goodman's parlance, the house was titled "Unit House No. 1-2L" (presumably, Unit No. 1 with two levels). The houses exhibit the "open floor plan" that was characteristic of all of Goodman's work. This flexible plan facilitated a more casual style of living, and responded to the changing status of women by integrating the kitchen area into the activities of the household.

<doc id="20157995" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20157995" title="Symphony in C (Bizet)">
Symphony in C (Bizet)

The Symphony in C is an early work by the French composer Georges Bizet. According to "Grove's Dictionary", the symphony "reveals an extraordinarily accomplished talent for a 17-year-old student, in melodic invention, thematic handling and orchestration." Bizet started work on the symphony on 29 October 1855, four days after turning 17, and finished it roughly a month later. It was written while he was studying at the Paris Conservatoire under the composer Charles Gounod, and was evidently a student assignment. Bizet showed no apparent interest in having it performed or published, and while he used certain material from the symphony in later works, the piece was never played in his lifetime. There is no mention of the work in Bizet's letters, and it was unknown to his earlier biographers. His widow, Geneviève Halévy (1849–1926), gave the manuscript to Reynaldo Hahn, who left it along with other papers to the archives of the conservatory library, where it was found in 1933 by Jean Chantavoine. Soon thereafter, Bizet's first British biographer Douglas Charles Parker (1885–1970) showed the manuscript to the conductor Felix Weingartner, who led the first performance in Basel, Switzerland, on 26 February 1935.
The symphony was immediately hailed as a youthful masterpiece on a par with Felix Mendelssohn's overture to "A Midsummer Night's Dream", written at about the same age, and quickly became part of the standard Romantic repertoire. It received its first recording on 26 November 1937, by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Walter Goehr.
Form.
Written for a standard orchestra (without trombones), the work closely follows the classical symphonic form in four movements. The first and the last movement are in sonata form.
History.
Background.
The symphony is widely assumed to have been a student assignment, written toward the end of Bizet's nine years of study at the Conservatoire de Paris. At the Conservatoire, Bizet had come increasingly under the influence of Charles Gounod, whose works in the first half of the 1850s—including "Sapho" (1851), "Ulysse" (1852) and the Symphony No. 1 in D major (1855)—had a strong impact on the young composer. As Bizet would later write of this period: "Fifteen years ago [i.e.1855/56], when I used to say "Sapho and the choruses from Ulysse are masterpieces", people laughed in my face. I was right..." In 1855, with Gounod his principal mentor, Bizet wrote his first three major compositions: the opera "La maison du docteur", an overture, and the Symphony in C. A year before Bizet started to compose the Symphony, Gounod had written his own first Symphony (in D), composed at the end of 1854 in the wake of a tepid response to his opera "La nonne sanglante". Gounod's Symphony in D proved a popular work, receiving at least eight performances in Paris alone within the space of a year. Bizet was subsequently engaged with writing a transcription of the work for two pianos, one of a number of commissions to transcribe Gounod's work Bizet accepted to earn extra income. This proximity to his mentor's work emerges in the close stylistic resemblance of Bizet's symphony with Gounod's; it may also explain why Bizet chose not to publish his symphony.
Similarities with Gounod's Symphony in D.
The numerous stylistic, orchestral, melodic and harmonic similarities between the Gounod and Bizet symphonies make it clear that Bizet was emulating and, in certain cases, directly quoting his teacher. As Howard Shanet, who revived Gounod's symphony with the Columbia University Orchestra in 1955, observed, "the first glance at [Gounod's] score ... made it clear that the young Bizet had copied all its most conspicuous features in his Symphony in C." There are, in fact, so many references, parodies and quotations from Gounod in Bizet's work that it is likely the young composer was consciously paying homage to his celebrated teacher. His close involvement with Gounod's orchestral score in realising the two-piano transcription would have given Bizet the opportunity to explore many of its orchestral nuances and incorporate them into his own work and may explain why Bizet's first full-fledged symphonic work was such an unusually well-polished and well-orchestrated composition. As Bizet would later write to his former teacher "You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you. You are the cause, I am the consequence." This sentiment permeates the compositional spirit of the Symphony in C. 
All four movements of Bizet's symphony employ devices found in the earlier Gounod piece. The two inner movements are strikingly similar in form, rhythm and melodic shape.
First movement<br>
Like Gounod, Bizet bookends the opening movement with an opening tutti chord and closing codetta that are essentially parodic in form. In two passages, at measures 86ff and 141ff Bizet quotes directly from Gounod, measures 119ff and mm. 331ff. (See illustration.)
Second movement<br>
Bizet draws very closely from Gounod's "Allegretto moderato" in the Symphony in D. Like Gounod, Bizet composed a small fugue as the development section, using an identical scoring in the order of entry. Both start sotto voce with staccato articulation and share a closely similar phrase shape. And in both works, the first theme is brought back in the recapitulation over passages in the strings that recall the fugal development.
Third movement<br>
Although quite different in tempo and character, Bizet's scherzo makes several references to the Gounod's scherzo in the trio section. Both are variants of the opening theme and both are played on the woodwinds over a string pedal-point.
Final Movement<br>
Beyond a general thematic sympathy between the two finales, Bizet directly imitates Gounod's closing phrase in his own work, drawing on the same rhythmic shape and architecture to create a miniature coda. 
Finally, the scoring for both works is identical: a smaller, classical orchestra (omitting, for instance, piccolo, harp or trombones). 
Although Bizet’s symphony was closely drawing on Gounod's work, critics view it as a much superior composition, showing a precocious and sophisticated grasp of harmonic language and design, as well as originality and melodic inspiration. Since it has resurfaced, Bizet's Symphony in C has far outshone Gounod's work in the repertoire, both in terms of performance and numbers of recordings.
Suppression.
That the Symphony was never even mentioned in Bizet's extensive correspondence, let alone published in his lifetime, has given rise to speculation as to the composer's motives in suppressing the work. According to a 1938 correspondence from Bizet's publisher, 
Antoine de Choudens, founder of the Choudens Publishing House and Bizet's editor, had in his possession Bizet's youthful symphony. If he never published it, this was because Bizet himself was opposed to the idea, having introduced into his work "Don Procopio" an excerpt from the symphony he thought suitable for this theatre piece. This latter was published by Choudens in 1905. Further, the widow of G. Bizet, respecting the wishes of her husband, confirmed her husband's intentions to the publisher. (signed) Chevrier-Choudens 
This explanation, however, was rejected by Shanet, who instead argued that Bizet was worried that his own work was too similar to Gounod's:
The probable reason for Bizet's unwillingness to publish the Symphony in C was ... sensitivity about his imitation of certain features of Gounod's Symphony in D. The very success of Gounod's piece, which must have stimulated the young man to copy some of its methods, would later have
deterred him from having his own symphony performed or published. For it must be remembered that the Gounod symphony was then one of the most famous French works of its kind, and that Bizet had borrowed from it precisely those features that everyone else had noticed and admired.
Since no evidence exists one way or the other, Bizet's motives must remain conjectural. However, the symphonic genre was not a popular one for French composers in the second half of the nineteenth century, who instead concentrated most of their large-scale efforts on theatrical and operatic music. Gounod himself observed "There is only one way for a composer who desires to make a real name - the operatic stage." This bias against formal symphonic writing was also entrenched within the culture of the Paris Conservatory, which considered the symphony to be (as in the case of Bizet's own) a mere student exercise on the path toward submissions for the Prix de Rome, the highest prize a young French composer could attain. As the noted musicologist Julien Tiersot observed in 1903:
In [19th-century] France the symphony was considered a scholastic exercise, so much so that for a long time it appeared only with those competing to be "sent to Rome." It seems that a well-written symphony was the supreme test of the talent of young composers crowned by the Academy. ... But it clearly had no greater importance nor a higher artistic meaning in the eyes of the judges... Gounod, Félicien David, Henri Reber, they too, in their lost moments, wrote symphonies, works that did justice to the purity of their intentions, but none of which has remained alive.
Instead, as Tiersot himself noted, French symphonic efforts gravitated toward the symphonic suite, of which Bizet's misnamed Roma Symphony was a pioneering example. Indeed, where his youthful Symphony was written in less than a month, the Roma "Symphony" occupied Bizet for years, and he remained at his death unsatisfied with the work. Unlike the Symphony in C, Bizet tried to infuse his Roma Symphony with more gravitas and thematic weight. Of the two works, it is Bizet's student composition which has garnered much more critical praise.
It may also have been, as hinted at by the 1938 correspondence from Chevrier-Choudens, that Bizet intended to mine his student effort for material in what he saw as more serious compositions (including, possibly, two aborted symphonies written while in Rome). The melodic theme of the slow movement reappears in "Les pêcheurs de perles" as the introduction to Nadir's air "De mon amie." And Bizet recycled the same melody in the trio of the Minuet from "L'Arlésienne". In both cases, Bizet retained his original scoring for oboe. As noted by Chevrier-Choudens, Bizet also used the second theme of the finale in Act I of "Don Procopio". Finally, since he was only 36 when he died, it is entirely possible that had he lived, Bizet might have decided later to publish the work. Whatever the case, the work remained unpublished, unplayed, and unknown at Bizet's death, passing into the possession of his widow, Geneviève Halévy.
Rediscovery and posthumous popularity.
Although Bizet's first biographer, Douglas Charles Parker, is widely credited with bringing the symphony to public attention, it was the French musicologist Jean Chantavoine who first revealed the existence of the work, in an article published in the periodical "Le Ménestrel" in 1933. Parker, alerted to its existence, informed the Austrian conductor Felix Weingartner, who gave the highly successful premiere in Basel in 1935. The work was published the same year by Universal-Edition.
Within a short time of its publication, the work had been widely performed. The musicologist John W. Klein, who attended its London premiere, found the work "enchanting" and "charming," a view that has been generally echoed since. Although a student assignment, many musicologists find the symphony shows a precocious grasp of harmonic language and design, a sophistication which has invited comparisons with Haydn, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Rossini, and Beethoven.
Adaptations.
George Balanchine made a ballet to the music, which he originally called "Le Palais de Cristal" and later simply "Symphony in C", first presented by the Paris Opera Ballet in 1947.

Charles Grove

Charles William Collard Grove (16 December 1912 – 15 February 1982) was an English cricketer who taking over 700 first-class wickets during the course of over 200 games in the mid-20th century, mostly for Warwickshire. He had one season for Worcestershire at the end of his career.
Grove appeared for Warwickshire's Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship as early as 1933,
but his first-class debut was five years later in June 1938 against Northamptonshire, when he took 3-53 including the wicket of opposing captain Robert Nelson at Edgbaston.
His two other first-class games that summer brought Grove no wickets, but in 1939 he took 37, including two five-wicket hauls, and (said his "Wisden" obituarist) showed promise before the Second World War intervened.
He played a number of matches during the war,
but his first-class career did not resume until 1947. He took 98 wickets that season, and though this figure was reduced to 60 the following year, he managed at least 80 every season from 1949 until the end of his Warwickshire career in 1953.
A notable performance in 1950 was his first-innings 8-38 against the West Indians,
which helped Warwickshire to become the only county that season to defeat the tourists.
He passed fifty on five occasions in his career, all between 1947 and 1949, including one century: 104 not out against Leicestershire in late August 1948; he scored his runs in 80 minutes.
In 1951, Grove's benefit year,
he took 100 wickets in a season for the first time, finishing with 110 at 18.52. The 1952 season saw him top this total as he helped Warwickshire to the County Championship title: he picked up 118 wickets, including ten or more in a match on four occasions, and claimed a career best 9-39 versus Sussex in June.
As of 2008, only Jack Bannister (twice) has recorded better innings figures for Warwickshire since Grove's achievement.
Grove ended his Warwickshire career after the 1953 season, and then had a single year with Worcestershire, playing only the middle part of the season. Although he took 8-66 against Gloucestershire in late May,
he was not particularly successful, finishing the year with 42 wickets at an average of slightly over 30. His final first-class outing came against Derbyshire in mid-July, and was an unsuccessful experience for Grove: he took 0-68 in the match and made a duck in his only innings.
He later played club cricket in the Birmingham League.

Owen Red Hanrahan

Owen Red Hanrahan is a fictional character who appears in several works by William Butler Yeats.
Yeats based the character largely on the real-life bard Owen Roe O'Sullivan (Eoghan Ruadh Ó Súilleabháin). In his first appearances, in fact, Hanrahan's name is O'Sullivan the Red, with Yeats later altering the name to Hanrahan the Red and ultimately Owen "Red" Hanrahan and making him more of an amalgam of the bardic tradition and a heavily folkloric character. Hanrahan first appears in Yeats's work in the mid-1890s as the author of various poems and songs. He is the central figure of a half-dozen short stories, collectively titled "Stories of Red Hanrahan", in 1897.
In the first of these short stories, Hanrahan is described at the outset as "the hedge schoolmaster, a tall, strong, red-haired young man," who first appears as he enters a "barn where some of the men of the village were
sitting on Samhain Eve." This description identifies Hanrahan with Irish folklore in several ways; schoolmasters were often nationalistic poets; red-headed men often possess magical powers; and supernatural occurrences often take place on Samhain. In the following stories, Hanrahan, in his wandering, is confounded both by women and by several supernatural experiences.

High Cotton (song)

"High Cotton" is a song written by Scott Anders and Roger Murrah, and recorded by American country music group Alabama. It was released in July 1989 as the third single from the album "Southern Star". The song was one of four singles on the album to reach number one on the Hot Country Singles chart.
Lyrics.
The song is a reminiscence of the youth of the narrator, who explains how his younger days were so good, and how he didn't realize how the times would change. ""We didn't know that times were lean / Around our house the grass was green / It didn't seem like things were all that bad."" The song references some the morals and customs characteristic of religious farming families, especially during the olden days, such as taking Sunday as a strict day of rest, whether or not there was work that could be done. The whole fourth stanza of the song references this ""When Sunday mornings rolled around / We dressed up in hand-me-downs / Just in time, togather with the church / Sometimes I think how long it's been / And how it impressed me then / It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work."" It also glorifies a generally simple lifestyle of hard work. ""I bet we walked a thousand miles /" 
"Choppin' cotton and pushin' plows / And learnin' how to give it all we had.""
Music video.
The music video consists of fairly modern (upon release of the song) footage of a farm. The early 1950s Cadillac convertible that is seen in the video is being driven by the band members of Alabama, who seem to be observing with admiration the things they are seeing that relate to the context of the song. The video was directed by Jack Cole.

Long Beach Public Library (New York)

The Long Beach Public Library is the public library of Long Beach, New York, serving the civic, cultural, educational and recreational needs of the community. The central library has two branches: one in Point Lookout, New York and the other at the West End of Long Beach, off New York Ave.
The Long Beach Public Library was founded in 1928 and had its first site at 124 West Park Avenue. The original site has been declared a landmark by the Long Beach Historical Society just above the popular Sutton Place Bar and Grill. 
The first year the Library was open, more than 2000 people registered for library cards. Seven years later the Library needed a bigger space so it moved its location near the Long Island Railroad. Although the space was bigger, many patrons complained about noise, so a new location was needed.
The library moved to its current three floor building in 1954. In 1997, the Library underwent a major renovation.
Hurricane Sandy in 2012 closed the main library until the following March. The much smaller West End branch remained closed.

Takoma Park Historic District (Takoma Park, Maryland)

The Takoma Park Historic District is a national historic district located at Takoma Park, Montgomery County, Maryland. The district area was platted in 1883 by developer Benjamin Franklin Gilbert, and promoted for its natural environment and healthy setting. Originally an early railroad suburb, the opening of streetcar lines led to the expansion of the district in the early 20th century. Takoma Park houses built between 1883 and 1900 are fanciful, turreted, multi-gabled affairs of Queen Anne architecture with Stick Style and Shingle Style influence. Buildings developed after the turn of the 20th century tend to be 1-2 story brick structures with simple ornamentation, although a few display characteristics of such styles as Art Deco and Tudor Revival.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Northern Ireland local elections, 1985

Elections for local government were held in Northern Ireland on 15 May 1985.
Background.
1981 elections.
The previous elections had been fought in the middle of the hunger strike and the H-Block Prison Protest. Those elections had shown changes in party representation, with three parties, namely the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), winning 75% of the seats. On the Unionist side, the DUP arrived at a position of near parity with the UUP, outpolling the latter by 851 votes, although the UUP managed to win more seats overall. Other changes on the Unionist side saw the disbandment of two smaller Unionist parties: the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland in September 1981 and the United Ulster Unionist Party in May 1984. On the nationalist side, while the SDLP maintained its dominant position, a greater number of elected candidates supporting the H-Block protest were elected. In total 36 candidates endorsed by the H-Block committee were elected of whom 21 belonged to the IIP. The representation of the centrist APNI was almost halved as their number of seats was reduced from 70 in 1977 to 38 in 1981.
Northern Ireland Assembly and New Ireland Forum.
Following the end of the Hunger Strike, attention focused on attempts by the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Jim Prior, to restore devolution. This eventually led to the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly which was elected in October 1982. However nationalist parties boycotted the forum and the SDLP instead threw its efforts into the New Ireland Forum. This forum, established in May 1983, reported in May 1984 and represented the combined efforts of the nationalist parties to obtain a solution to the constitutional issue. However the report was rejected by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who rejected each of the three proposals with the words “that is out” in a response that became known as the "out, out, out" speech.
Sinn Féin.
The entry into electoral politics of Sinn Féin (SF) became a significant issue in the run up to the elections. SF polled over 10% in the 1982 Assembly election, winning five seats. At the 1983 Westminster election, the party increased their vote share to 13.4% and maintained that level of support in the 1984 European election. The party won their first council seat in a by-election in March 1983, with Seamus Kerr polling 60% in Omagh ‘Area D’ This was followed by the election of Alex Maskey and Sean McKnight to Belfast City Council in June 1983 and February 1984 respectively. In Dungannon and Fermanagh, independent councillors Seamus Cassidy and John Joe McCusker joined SF.
Prior's successor as Secretary of State, Douglas Hurd, refused to ban SF and also rejected calls by unionists for an anti-violence declaration to be signed by all candidates.
Rates.
The expansion of services, particularly leisure began to have an impact in rates at a time when the Rate Support Grant was being cut. The grant was reduced by 1% in 1985. Belfast Leisure Services in particular accounted for 22.7% of the City budget. Rates overall had risen by 8% in the financial year from 1984 to 1985, a figure above the rate of inflation and resulted in the cancellation of a proposed ice rink in Belfast, while that in Bangor had to receive private funding. Since the 1980–1981 financial year, rates had risen by 51.7% ranging from a 17.9% rise in Castlereagh to 80% rises in Omagh and Newry and Mourne.
Legislation.
Boundaries.
The Local Government (N.I.) Act 1972, Section 50 (1) required a review of local government boundaries and electoral areas in 1981, however it was not until 28 October 1982 that Prior reappointed Sir F. Harrison, who had conducted the previous review in 1971 and 1972. Provisional recommendations were published on 20 May 1983. These led to additional representations and nineteen public hearings before revised recommendations were published on 18 January 1984. Following six further public hearings, the final report was sent to the Secretary of State on 29 May 1984.
The report recommended no change in the number of councils or their names. The number of wards was increased from 526 to 566. Moyle was the only council to lose a ward.
With the wards drawn the government decided that a new procedure would be used to group them together to form District Electoral Areas (DEA). In 1972 the wards had been grouped together into areas of four to eight wards with each area electing a number of councillors equal to the number of wards that it contained. This had been done by the Chief Electoral Officer, a fact that had been criticised for potentially affecting his impartiality.
The District Electoral Areas Commissioner (N.I.) Order was laid before Parliament on 15 December 1983. This provided for the appointment of a commissioner and set him the task of creating electoral areas containing five to seven members. These were to have names rather than an alphabetic designation as before. The debate over the Order in January and February 1984 centred on the merits of STV, the narrower number of councillors in each DEA and the names issue. Unionists argued for DEAs electing four to six councillors.

In 1886 and 1889 Kükenthal traveled to regions in the Arctic, and in 1893-94, with support from the Senckenberg Natural History Society, participated in an expedition to Borneo and the Moluccas. He specialized in the study of Octocorallia, a taxonomic subclass that includes sea pens, sea fans and soft corals. He also conducted embryological and comparative anatomical investigations of whales and other marine mammals. His large collection of zoological specimens is now housed at the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt.
He has over twenty zoological species named after him, including "Hemirhamphodon kuekenthali" (Kuekenthal's halfbeak), "Parantica kuekenthali" (Kuekenthal's yellow tiger) and "Lysmata kuekenthali" (Kuekenthal's cleaner shrimp).
Kükenthaløya, a small island located between Spitsbergen and Barentsøya is named in his honor.

Orion Assembly

Orion Assembly is a General Motors vehicle assembly plant located in Orion Township, Michigan. The plant currently assembles the Chevrolet Sonic and Buick Verano. the plant employs 159 salaried employees and 1,300 hourly employees.
History.
Orion Assembly commenced production on December 1, 1983 with the 1985 model C-body cars. Orion Assembly produced the Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac G6 until 2009, when the plant was idled due to the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization of 2009. Under an agreement with the UAW, the plant began assembling the successor to the South Korean-built Chevrolet Aveo, the Chevrolet Sonic, in 2011 — making it the only subcompact car currently assembled in America. 
Later in 2011, the plant began manufacturing the Buick Verano.
In the past, GM assembled subcompact vehicles in Mexico or in South Korea due to lower cost labor rates in those countries. Under the new agreement with the UAW, GM will use domestic laborers earning less than under previous contracts and slimmed down labor rules to make assembling subcompact vehicles in the US economically competitive. This arrangement replaced GM's previous plan to import a new subcompact vehicle from China. Orion township and the State of Michigan offered competitive tax breaks to keep the plant open and to build the new subcompact. Orion's bid was selected over others from plants in Wisconsin and Tennessee.
Dedication ceremony.
On July 5, 1984, President Ronald Reagan gave a ceremonial dedication speech at the plant. Also in attendance were Michigan Governor Jim Blanchard, Michigan Senators Carl Levin and Don Riegle, Representative (from the local district) William Broomfield and notable General Motors executives, including chairman and CEO Roger Smith.
During his speech, Reagan commended both GM and the United Auto Workers for their progress in the automotive industry.
