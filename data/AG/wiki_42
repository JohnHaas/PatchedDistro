Walton Hall is a late 18th-century country house, now a farmhouse, situated at Foljambe Avenue, Walton, Chesterfield. It is a Grade II listed building.
The house occupies the site of the former manor house known as Walton Hall, which was the seat of the Foljambe family in the 16th and 17th centuries. Several members of the family served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire.
The old house was sold by the Foljambes in 1633 and the estate was thereafter held by a succession of owners including Ingram, Fletcher, Jenkinson, Hunloke and Turbutt.
The present modest three-storey three-bayed house was built in the late 18th century and has latterly been a farmhouse.

In 1920 he was living with his parents in Münster when he decided to return to Berlin to attend the National Education Institute, but he resigned prior to obtaining his baccalaureate.

He left the Reichswehr in 1929 and held a number of positions, he studied engineering at Friedberg, was an assistant engineer at a power plant.
His next occupation was in Quedlinburg where he opened a jewelry store with his wife and sister-in-law.
In 1933 he was selected to join the SS-Sonderkommando at Jüterbog which was one of the units that would become the Leibstandartes SS "Adolf Hitler"., initially in the 3rd Company, but would in October 1933 command the II Battalion "LSSAH" until 1939.
World War II.
Wagner transferred to the Das Reich in 1940, first in command of the "Germania" Regiment, then commander of the 11th SS Regiment for the invasion of the Balkans (Operation Marita).
In May 1942 he was given command of the 9th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment "Germania" which was now part of the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking and participated in heavy fighting in the Caucasus during Operation Barbarossa the invasion of Russia.
For the destruction of the Tank Group Popov at Krassno - Armaiskoje he was promoted to Oberführer and awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.
In October 1943 he was given command of the 23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland, which was stationed in Croatia.

In April 1944 Wagner was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS and given command of the 4th SS Polizei Division.

Wagner was extradited to Yugoslavia in 1947. There, he was put on trial before the military tribunal of the 3rd Yugoslav Army from 29 May to 6 June 1947 in Zrenjanin. It is not precisely known for what he was indicted for, however his orders for the mass executions of civilians in 1941 and later on reportedly played a role in his conviction. Found guilty of the charges, he was sentenced to death by firing squad. It is unclear when the sentence was carried out. Other sources mention 5 April 1947 as the execution date, but this seems unlikely, as he was still alive and under trial in June 1947.

Biffen och Bananen ("the Beef and the Banana") was a comic strip by Rit-Ola (Jan-Erik Garland), originally published in "Folket i Bild" in 1936, where it ran until 1978. The strip was also published in albums and in the Swedish comic book "".
Description.
The comic is about two friends, the strong Biffen (based on the heavyweight boxer Harry Dahlgren) and the intelligent Bananen (based on Rit-Ola himself). Their adventures were often set in or around Stockholm, or on vacation in Africa and southern Europe. The setting was often athletic, and all characters spoke Stockholmska. After a few years the duo was accompanied by a third character, Galento, named after the boxer Tony Galento.
Rit-Ola was given rather loose directions for the comics: he was required to avoid the topics of drunkedness and rape; he was obliged to deliver the strip four to five weeks prior to the publication date; and the comic must be drawn in black, white, and red.
Three movies were made about the characters: "Biffen och Bananen" (1951), "Blondie, Biffen och Bananen" (1952), and "Klarar Bananen Biffen?" (1957). Biffen was played by Åke Grönberg and Bananen by Åke Söderblom.

Altenberg Trio

The Altenberg Trio is a piano trio formed in 1994 in Vienna. It is named after a Viennese poet Peter Altenberg. Since its debut during the Salzburg Mozart Week in 1994, it is one of the few full-time piano trios in Europe. The ensemble became Trio-in-residence of Vienna's Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (Musikverein) where it gives an annual series of concerts in the Brahms Saal. Their repertoire encompasses more than 250 piano trios, among them works that were composed for and premiered by the Altenberg Trio, such as Douglas Weiland's First Trio, opus 22 (1995).
In 1999, following the release of their recording of the complete Schumann piano trios, the Trio received the Robert Schumann Award of the City of Zwickau. Their recording of trios of Ives (Piano Trio), Copland and Bernstein (Piano Trio) won the Edison Award in Amsterdam in 2000.
In 2012 Christopher Hinterhuber replaced Claus-Christian Schuster as pianist and Christoph Stradner replaced Alexander Gebert as cellist.

James Hanham

Major James Moore Hanham (January 4, 1840 Woodville, Mississippi – December 30, 1923 New York, New York) was an American chess master, who played in many American and international chess tournaments between 1884 and 1889. He fought on the side of the North during the American Civil War, reaching the rank of Major. He is remembered today for several innovations in the opening, particularly the Hanham Variation of Philidor's Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Nd7).
Military service, appearance.
Although a Mississippian, Hanham fought for the Union Army during the Civil War. He saw action at Fort Pickens and Baton Rouge, and was promoted to the rank of Major. After the war, he moved to Manhattan.
A writer in the "New York Times", describing the players in the Sixth American Chess Congress (1889), portrayed him as follows:
Major Hanham is a little, nervous man, who hates to sit still. He won his title during the war of the rebellion. He was one of the dudes of the tournament, and was always dressed in the latest style, with a carefully polished silk hat and neatly trimmed beard.
Chess career.
Hanham played in many American and international chess tournaments between 1884 and 1899. At American tournaments, he finished second to Eugene Delmar in the 8th and 9th championships of the Manhattan Chess Club, both held in 1885, and at an 1886 New York Chess Club tournament. At Cincinnati 1888, the first United States Chess Association tournament, he tied for 2nd–3rd with 5.5/10, far behind winner Jackson Showalter. He finished 3rd with 3/6 at Lexington 1891, the fourth United States Chess Association tournament, behind Showalter and William Pollock, who tied for first at 5/6. He won two tournaments at Skaneateles, New York in 1891. According to Chessmetrics, Hanham's best-ever performance was at Grove Spring 1898, where he scored 4.5/7 for the New York State team against the Pennsylvania team.
At international tournaments, Hanham performed respectably but not spectacularly, usually finishing in the bottom half. At London and Nottingham, both in 1886, he finished 12th out of 13 with a 3.5/12 score, and 8th out of 10 with a 2/9 score, respectively. At the Sixth American Chess Congress at New York 1889, a double round robin that was one of the longest tournaments in history, Hanham scored 14/38, finishing 16th out of 20 players; Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first with 29 points, edging out Isidor Gunsberg (28.5). At New York 1894, Hanham tied for 7th–9th with a 4/10 score; recently dethroned World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz won with 8.5/10.
One of Hanham's best results was at New York 1893, where he scored 7.5/13 (finishing 6th of 14 players), beat the young Harry Nelson Pillsbury, and finished half a point ahead of him. Emanuel Lasker, who would become World Champion the following year, won with a perfect score.
By Arpad Elo's calculation, Hanham's strength during his five-year peak was equivalent to an Elo rating of 2360. 
At the time of his death in 1923, Hanham was the oldest player of master rank in the United States.
Opening innovations.
Hanham's name is best remembered today for the Hanham Variation of Philidor's Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Nd7). David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld note in "The Oxford Companion to Chess" that this line, which became a favorite of the great player and theoretician Aron Nimzowitsch, allows Black to maintain a defensive center and has become one of the main lines of Philidor's Defense. Larry Kaufman writes that it is a "strategically rich variation" but is out of favor today because 4.Bc4! is awkward for Black, when 4...Ngf6? loses to 5.Ng5, 4...Be7? loses a pawn to 5.dxe5 Nxe5 (5...dxe5? 6.Qd5! wins) 6.Nxe5 dxe5 7.Qh5!, and 4...c6 (best) allows 5.0-0 Be7 6.dxe5 dxe5 (6...Nxe5? 7.Nxe5 dxe5 8.Qh5 wins a pawn) 6.Ng5! Bxg5 7.Qh5 Qe7 8.Qxg5, when White's bishop pair gives him a substantial advantage. To avoid this line, today Black often tries to reach the Hanham by different move orders, such as 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Nf6 4.Nc3 Nbd7, 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5 4.Nf3 Nbd7, or 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 Nbd7 4.Nf3 e5.
Hooper and Whyld also credit Hanham with introducing a number of other opening lines, including the Grand Prix Attack against the Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4), the Indian Opening (1.e4 e5 2.d3), and the Hanham Variation of the French Defense (1.e4 e6 2.d3), often referred to today as the King's Indian Attack.
Notable game.
In this game from the Sixth American Chess Congress (at New York in 1889), Hanham (playing Black) uses his eponymous variation to defeat Joseph Henry Blackburne, one of the world's leading players:
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bc4 Be7 4.Nc3 c6 5.d4 Nd7 6.O-O Ngf6 7.Qe2 O-O 8.Be3 Qc7 reaching the typical setup of the Hanham Variation of Philidor's Defense. 9.Bb3 h6 10.Nh4 Nb6 11.Ng6 Re8 12.dxe5 dxe5 13.h3 Bd6 14.Rad1 Be6 15.Bxe6 Rxe6 16.Nh4 Nbd7 17.Nf5 Bf8 18.g4 Nh7 19.h4 Rg6 20.Kh1 Nc5 21.Rg1 Ne6 22.Rg3 Rd8 23.Rdg1 Nd4 24.Qf1 Nxc2 25.Bc1 Nd4 26.h5 Rf6 27.f4 exf4 28.Bxf4 Qa5 29.Qc1 Re6 30.Bd2 Qe5 31.Bf4 Qa5 32.Be3 Nb5 33.Bd2 Nxc3 34.Bxc3 Qa4 35.Re1 Rxe4 36.b3 Rxe1+ 37.Qxe1 Qxa2 38.g5 hxg5 39.h6 Qc2 40.Nd4 Qg6 41.Qe5 Qxh6+ 42.Kg2 Qd6 43.Qe2 Qd5+ 44.Kh3 Qh1+ 45.Kg4 Nf6+ 46.Kxg5 Rd5+ 47.Kf4 Bd6+ 0-1

Greenplum's products include its Unified Analytics Platform, Data Computing Appliance, Analytics Lab, Database, HD and Chorus. Greenplum was acquired by EMC Corporation in July 2010, and then became part of GoPivotal in 2012. 
Company.
Greenplum was founded in September 2003 by Scott Yara and Luke Lonergan.
It was a merger of two smaller companies Metapa in Los Angeles and Didera in Fairfax, Virginia.
Investors included SoundView Ventures, Hudson Ventures and Royal Wulff Ventures. A total of $20 million in funding was announced at the merger.
Greenplum, based in in San Mateo, California, released its database management system software in April 2005 calling it Bizgres.
In July 2006 a partnership with Sun Microsystems was announced.
Greenplum was acquired by EMC Corporation in July 2010, becoming the foundation of EMC's Big Data Division.
Its computer appliance was announced in October 2010.
In 2011 Greenplum announced more products and services. 
In May 2012 Greenplum released its Analytics Workbench, and in October 2012 Chorus. 
In December 2012 it became part of a joint venture of EMC and VMware which took the name Pivotal in March 2013.
Technology.
The Greenplum Database builds on the foundations of open source database PostgreSQL. It primarily functions as a data warehouse and utilizes a shared-nothing, massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture. In this architecture, data is partitioned across multiple segment servers, and each segment owns and manages a distinct portion of the overall data; there is no disk-level sharing nor data contention among segments.
Greenplum Database's parallel query optimizer converts each query into a physical execution plan. Greenplum's optimizer uses a cost-based algorithm to evaluate potential execution plans, takes a global view of execution across the computer cluster, and factors in the cost of moving data between nodes. The resulting query plans contain traditional relational database operations as well as parallel "motion" operations that describe when and how data should be transferred between nodes during query execution.
Commodity Gigabit Ethernet and 10-gigabit Ethernet technology is used for the transfer between nodes.
During execution of each node in the plan, multiple relational operations are processed by pipelining: the ability to begin a task before its predecessor task has completed, to increase effective parallelism. For example, while a table scan is taking place, rows selected can be pipelined into a join process.
Internally, the Greenplum system utilizes log shipping and segment-level replication and provides automated failover. At the storage level, RAID techniques can mask disk failures. At the system level, Greenplum replicates segment and master data to other nodes to ensure that the loss of a machine will not impact the overall database availability.
In 2009 technology was announced to use parallel streams of data for extract, transform and load operations.
This technology is exposed to customers via a programmable "external table" interface and a traditional command-line loading interface.
In addition to traditional Structured Query Language (SQL), in 2008 support was announced for MapReduce queries within a parallel dataflow engine, to run analytics against datasets stored in and outside of the Greenplum Database.
For each table (or partition of a table), database administrators can select the storage, execution and compression settings that suit the way that table will be accessed. Greenplum DB transparently abstracts the details of any table or partition, allowing a variety of underlying models: traditional row-oriented tables, optimized for read-mostly scans and bulk append loads, or column-oriented.
Database administrators also can tune the storage types and compression settings of different partitions within the same table.
Greenplum HD is a supported version of Apache Hadoop. It includes Hadoop's Distributed File System (HDFS), Hive, Pig, HBase, and ZooKeeper.
Greenplum Chorus is a social network portal for data science teams.
The Greenplum Data Computing Appliance (DCA) is a physical computer appliance to integrate structured data, unstructured data, and partner applications such as business intelligence. A special version of DCA integrated with SAS software was released in April 2011.
Greenplum Command Center software displays interactive dashboards to collect performance metrics and manage system health for Greenplum products. Monitored data is also stored for historical reporting.
Greenplum Analytics Lab was a data science consultation service, renamed Pivotal Data Labs in 2013.
Greenplum Database was supported for production use on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10.2 (64-bit), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.x (64-bit), CentOS Linux 5.x (64-bit) and Sun Solaris 10U5+ (64-bit). Greenplum Database was supported on server hardware from a range of vendors including HP, Dell, Sun and IBM.
Greenplum Database was supported for non-production (development and evaluation) use on Mac OSX 10.5, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 or higher (32-bit) and CentOS Linux 5.2 or higher (32-bit).
Greenplum had customers in vertical markets from financial services, telecommunications, Internet, retail, transportation and pharmaceuticals industries. They included Silver Spring Networks, Zions Bancorporation, Reliance Communications, NYSE Euronext, Orbitz, Havas Digital, China Unicom, and Tagged.
Greenplum provides a community edition of its database, and community forums.
Greenplum DB has a limitation on indexing: Unique index and primary key index cannot be used at same time on a table.
Partnerships included Impetus Technologies, Cisco, Brocade Communications Systems, SAS (software), Factual, MicroStrategy, and Informatica.
Competitors include IBM, Oracle Exadata, Teradata, Aster Data Systems, Netezza, SAP, and Vertica.

<doc id="20294194" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20294194" title="John Howard (public health administrator)">
John Howard (public health administrator)

John Howard is a physician, professor, and public health administrator. He served a 6-year term as the director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and was appointed to be a special coordinator to respond to the health effects of the September 11 attacks. In this role Howard advocated for rescue workers, introducing a program to provide screening, medical exams, and treatment for them. In 2009, Howard was again appointed as director of NIOSH and as World Trade Center Programs coordinator for HHS.
Early career.
Education.
John Howard received a doctor of medicine degree from Loyola University in 1974 (cum laude). To this he added a Master of Occupational Health from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1982. In 1986, Dr. Howard earned a Juris Doctor from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and a Master of Laws in Administrative Law and Economic Regulation from The George Washington University in 1987. In addition, Dr. Howard is a board-certified occupational physician and has written numerous papers on occupational health law and policy.
Physician and professor.
Dr. Howard began his career in occupational health in 1979 as an internist at the UCLA School of Medicine pulmonary fellowship program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His clinical work involved asbestos-exposed shipyard workers, and he published research findings related to workplace exposure and occupational lung disease. He served as a medical director and chief clinician at the Philip Mandelker AIDS Prevention Clinic.
He also worked as an assistant professor of environmental and occupational medicine at the University of California, Irvine.
Department of Industrial Relations, California.
John Howard served as the chief of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health in California's Department of Industrial Relations beginning in 1991. There he administered a staff of nearly 1,000 and all the state's occupational and public safety programs. Through his administration of the division, Howard bolstered his reputation in the field as a passionate and able leader. He received praise for successfully implementing a controversial statewide ergonomic standard. He served in this capacity for more than a decade.
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
Appointment.
Linda Rosenstock resigned in November 2000 as the director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The position was not filled until July 15, 2002, when Tommy Thompson, Health and Human Services Secretary placed John Howard in the post. The gap between Rosenstock and Howard was the longest between directors in the agency's 31 year history. The appointment was immediately praised by several organizations including the American Industrial Hygiene Association and AFL-CIO.
A shift in focus.
Under Dr. Howard, NIOSH shifted its research efforts to focus on emerging technologies. Howard sought practical applications for the new research. This included an initiative called "research-to-practice" (r2p) to ensure that NIOSH's findings would turn into practices and products that would ultimately benefit workers. He directed research on mining, nanotechnology, job stress, and ergonomics. Howard summarized the adjustments the Institute needed to make:
Howard expanded the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) instituted by his predecessor, Dr. Rosenstock, using it as a vehicle to work toward the Institute's updated aims.
World Trade Center responders.
John Howard was appointed by President George W. Bush to be a special coordinator to handle the medical issues afflicting 9/11 rescue workers, specifically those at the World Trade Center site. Howard introduced the World Trade Center (WTC) Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, which offered medical help and screening to emergency workers.
Approach.
As a public health administrator, Howard was admired for his ability to collaborate effectively, even with adversarial parties. He was noted for the tone of "openness and cooperation" he set and for listening to and seeking input from all available stakeholders.
Removal from NIOSH.
As Dr. Howard's 6-year term approached its close, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Julie Gerberding met with him to inform him that he would not be reappointed. His term ended on July 14, 2008, in a "controversial decision that brought criticism from safety and health stakeholders". He completed his term and began serving as a temporary senior advisor to the CDC director. NIOSH associate director Christine Branche, Ph.D., served as acting director in Dr. Howard's place.
Reappointment at NIOSH.
On September 3, 2009, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced Howard's reappointment as director of NIOSH and World Trade Center Programs coordinator for HHS.

Bill Heller

Early life.
Dr. Heller was born in Scales Mound, Illinois on September 3, 1935.
He attended Bradley University in 1954. 
From 1954 to 1956 he served in the U.S. Army, with the 82nd Airborne Division. He earned the Parachutist Badge and the Expert Rifleman's Badge. He graduated from Southern Illinois University with a Bachelor of Science degree in elementary and special education in 1959 and received a 
Master of Science degree from Northern Illinois University in guidance and counseling in 1961. He earned an Education Doctorate from the University of Northern Colorado in special education in 1964.
Academic career.
From 1980 to 1992, he was dean of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte's College of Education and Allied Professions. He moved to Florida in 1992 to head University of South Florida St. Petersburg campus. He was the first permanent head of the St. Petersburg campus in three years, beginning in August 1992. His predecessor, Lowell E. Davis, had died in 1989. A number of temporary replacements had served in the interim. His brief was to develop the campus' business, liberal arts, and journalism departments, as well as to complete the library and marine center building projects.
Dr. Heller led the St. Petersburg campus as dean and chief executive officer from 1992 to 2002. He resigned as CEO of the St. Petersburg campus at the behest of USF president Judy Genshaft and became a faculty member in August 2002. 
The City Council had planned demolishing its Bayfront Center arena and theater complex to USF and renting the land to USF, which would have used the land to build a conference center. They had second thoughts when Dr. Heller resigned. A rental agreement with an outside agency such as USF would have required a referendum. Other options included renovation and finding some other use for the land after demolition. His successor was Karen White, former dean of fine arts at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and a concert violinist, originally from Joplin, Missouri.
Campaign and election in 2006.
Though party officials usually remain neutral in primaries, Dr. Heller was endorsed over Liz McCallum by several Pinellas Democrats in the contest to decide who would run to succeed Frank Farkas. These included County Commissioner Calvin Harris, State Representatives Charlie Justice and Frank Peterman, Jr. as well as St. Petersburg City Council members James Bennett, Rick Kriseman, and Rene Flowers, and School Board member Linda Lerner. County Commissioner Ken Welch remained neutral as he sat on the county canvassing board. McCallum had narrowly lost to Farkas in the 2004 election, by less than 3,000 votes. Despite McCallum's strong showing in 2004, Dr. Heller was encouraged to run by colleague Betty Castor, a former president of USF and former Florida Secretary of Education. He came into the race at a time when McCallum had been running about a year. He had remained active in the community after stepping down as head of the St. Petersburg campus, with membership on the boards of directors of Bayfront Medical Center, the Community Foundation of Tampa Bay, Great Explorations museum, Florida International Museum and Pinellas Association of Retarded Children. He cited his education experience and ties to the community as important qualities.
His community connections allowed Dr. Heller to quickly overcome his late start in fundraising, and swamp McCallum's campaign efforts. While she was taking a traditional door-to-door approach, he was able to raise money by making phone calls to acquaintances he had made over the previous 14 years. The "St. Petersburg Times" endorsed Dr. Heller, citing his ability to solve problems through consensus building and his work to make USF St. Petersburg independent. It also praised his success at promoting a successful referendum to improve taxpayer funding of teacher's pay, and his leadership in saving Sunken Gardens. A PAC, Pinellas Democrats PAC, endorsed a slate of candidates and ran an ad attacking Dr. Heller. In return, a graphic designer who had done work for the Heller campaign accused the PAC of violating contribution laws based on a $5000 contribution it had received, and lashed out against the wrongness of Democrats attacking fellow democrats. The PAC representatives countered that the $500 limit per individual contributor does not apply to PAC's. The Florida Democratic Party protested the use of the word "Democrats" in its name. Dr. Heller narrowly defeated McCallum in the primary, to face Republican Angelo Cappelli, the chair of the St. Anthony Hospital Foundation in November.
Similar in some ways, Dr Heller and Cappelli differed in personality and their views on social issues. Cappelli was seen as taking an authoritarian approach, while Dr. Heller was more inclined to collaborate with others. Heller favored prosecuting crimes based on sexual orientation as hate crimes and supported same sex-unions. He said he would ban selling semi-automatic weapons, and advocated including contraceptive and safe sex information in sex education classes. Heller supported embryonic stem cell research and categorized himself as pro-choice. A local political analyst, Darryl Paulson, described their differences on social issues as irrelevant, with property insurance as the most important issue for voters. Dr. Heller said he would address cherry picking by auto and life insurance companies. Cappelli favored encouraging insurance companies to return to the Florida market by implementing a state catastrophe fund. Capelli was seen as appealing to the Republican base and received large contributions from individuals and from the Florida Republican Party, Dr. Heller's support was seen as going beyond the Democratic Party because of his long term civic activity and because he was seen as someone able to work across party lines. Dr. Heller again faced an attack campaign when Capielli approved a flier paid for by the Florida Republican party that described Heller as a "nutty professor." The ad misrepresented Heller's support of the teacher's pay referendum, which was overwhelmingly supported by the voters, as a pro tax increase stance. Dr. Heller again received the "St. Petersburg Times" endorsement. While praising him for an "impressive" resume, they described Capiella as having "regressive views on gay rights, sex education, gun control and . . . school funding," based on his responses to a questionnaire from the Christian Coalition. Once again, Dr. Heller's years with USF and his involvement with the community, and his ability to work with others were cited as essential qualities. Added to this was the position that his progressivism more closely reflected the interests and views of voters in District 52. Despite the attack campaign and a disadvantage in campaign contributions, Dr. Heller's popularity won him the election handily. His long term ties to the area included a friendship with Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who endorsed neither candidate.
First term in the Florida Legislature.
In his freshman term, he was a member of the Agribusiness, Utilities and Telecommunications, and Post Secondary Education Committees as well as a member of the Schools and Learning Council. He was ranking Democrat on the Post Secondary Education Committee. He sponsored a number of bills.
In June 2006, a Pinellas Park man had claimed to have been thrown out of a bar for "not" drinking, despite his assertions that he was acting as the designated driver for his group. Sen. Mike Fasano, who claims to be a non drinker, took umbrage with this and introduced in the Senate a bill to illegalize requiring bar patrons to drink. Dr. Heller sponsored the bill in the House. There was an increase in the number of homeless people attacked by bored teenagers in Florida in 2006. In response, the Legislature acted to stiffen prison sentences for those who attack the homeless. Dr. Heller was one of four House sponsors of the bill. State Senator Arthenia Joyner sponsored an identical bill in the Senate.
Dr. Heller and two other Pinellas Democrats, Janet C. Long and Darryl Rouson voted to support the use of school vouchers, which Florida Democrats have historically been opposed to, citing separation issues. Dr. Heller had originally been opposed, but says he was persuaded that it was an issue of quality education after meeting with the parents who were using vouchers to send their children to a private school. 
He opposed a Bill in 2008 (HB 257) that would require pregnant women have a sonogram before undergoing a first-trimester abortion.
Campaign and election in 2008.
Dr. Heller was among three Pinellas legislative candidates endorsed by the Suncoast Group for the Sierra Club, with Carl Zimmerman and Janet C. Long. He was endorsed by the St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce, and Associated Industries of Florida. He also won the endorsement of the "St. Petersburg Times." They cited his ability to work across party lines and experience as an educator and former administrator with USF. They credited him with legislation that reduced the influence of the FCAT, working to ensure that autistic children would be able to receive health care coverage, and with the designated driver law. They believed he would be able to help prioritize educational programs in an era of reduced expenditures and increasing budgetary constraints. They also said he would offer insight into the problem of making windstorm insurance coverage more available and more affordable.
Representative Heller won re-election on November 4, 2008, defeating Republican Ross Johnson with 60% of the vote. Their campaign was good-natured with them waving to voters side by side on the same St. Petersburg street corner. He had support from Republican mayors Rick Baker of St. Petersburg and Frank Hibbard of Clearwater.

Central Park in the Dark

Central Park in the Dark is a music composition by Charles Ives for chamber orchestra. It was composed in 1906 and has been paired with "The Unanswered Question" as part of “Two Contemplations” and "Hallowe’en" and The Pond in “Three Outdoor Scenes.”
Composition.
The piece was first titled "A Contemplation of Nothing Serious or Central Park in the Dark in ‘The Good Old Summer Time’" (in comparison to "A Contemplation of a Serious Matter or The Unanswered Perennial Question"). Ives wrote detailed notes concerning the purpose and context of "Central Park in the Dark": This piece was composed in 1906.
This piece purports to be a picture-in-sounds of the sounds of nature and of happenings that men would hear some thirty or so years ago (before the combustion engine and radio monopolized the earth and air), when sitting on a bench in Central Park on a hot summer night.
The piece is scored for piccolo, flute, E-flat clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, trombone, percussion, two pianos and strings. Ives specifically suggests the two pianos be a player-piano and a grand piano. The orchestral group are to be separated spatially from each other. Ives described the role of the instruments in a programmatic description of the piece:
The strings represent the night sounds and silent darkness- interrupted by sounds from the Casino over the pond- of street singers coming up from the Circle singing, in spots, the tunes of those days- of some ‘night owls’ from Healy’s whistling the latest of the Freshman March- the “occasional elevated,” a street parade, or a “break-down” in the distance- of newsboys crying “uxtries”- of pianolas having a ragtime war in the apartment house “over the garden wall,” a street car and a street band join in the chorus- a fire engine, a cab horse runs away, lands “over the fence and out,” the wayfarers shout- again the darkness is heard- an echo over the pond- and we walk home.
Characteristics.
"Central Park in the Dark" displays several characteristics that are typical of Ives’s work. Ives layers of orchestral textures on top of each other to create a polytonal atmosphere. Within this polytonal atmosphere, Ives juxtaposes the different sections of the orchestras in contrasting and clashing pairings (i.e. the ambient, static strings against the syncopated ragtime pianos against a brass street band). These juxtapositions are a prevalent theme in the works of Ives, and can be seen most notably in "The Unanswered Question", "Three Places in New England", and the "Symphony No. 4".
Ives uses quotation in "Central Park in the Dark", using common themes from popular tunes of the day in his piece. He quotes the popular tune "Hello! Ma Baby" within the ragtime pianos and the "Washington Post March" within the street band. 
"Central Park in the Dark" is clearly a programmatic work, as can be derived from Ives’s own detailed narrative describing the piece. Ives’s work often relies on programmatic/narrative themes, allowing him to provide guidance through his dense scores.
Performance and recording.
The first documented performance of the piece was in New York on May 11, 1946 by the chamber orchestra students from Juilliard Graduate School conducted by Theodore Bloomfield. It was performed at an all-Ives concert at the McMillin Theatre at Columbia University as part of the Second Annual Festival of Contemporary America Music. Ives, in a letter for Elliot Carter remembered a different initial performance. In relation to programs to be printed for the concert Ives wrote:
Though it is not an important matter, it would be well—unless the programs for the May concert are already printed—not to put as a first public performance the ‘Central Park- some 40 years ago’ as it was cut down some, in instrumentation, for a Theater Orchestra and played between acts in a downtown Theatre in N.Y. doesn’t remember the exact date or the name of the theater. There was no program, but he thinks it was in 1906 or ’07. The players had a hard time with it—the piano player got mad, stopped in the middle and kicked the bass drum. However, don’t put the above in the program—just omit ‘First Performance’—as he feels, if not, it would be hardly fair to those old ‘fellers’ who stood up for a ‘dangerous job.’
The piece was first recorded in 1951 by the Polymusic Chamber Orchestra, under the direction of Will Lorin by Polymusic and has since been recorded by many orchestral groups.
Influence.
In “An Ives Celebration: Papers and Panels of the Charles Ives Centennial Festival Conference,” Hans G. Helms discussed the “strange historical coincidence” between Ives’s "Central Park in the Dark" and Karlheinz Stockhausen's "Gruppen fur Drei Orchester". He found that after a performance of "Central Park in the Dark" by the West German Radio Symphony Orchestra, Stockhausen came out with "Gruppen fur Drei Orchester", which had very similar musical qualities to the Ives piece, such as independent lines represented through individual players and dividing the orchestra spatially.

<doc id="20294329" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20294329" title="Center channel">
Center channel

Center channel refers to an audio channel common to many surround sound formats. It is the channel that is mostly, or fully, dedicated to the reproduction of the dialogue of an audiovisual program. The speaker(s) connected to the center channel are placed in the center of and behind the perforated projection screen, to give the effect that sounds from the center channel are coming from the screen. In many home surround sound units, the center channel is positioned above or below the video screen.
In the post-production process of filmmaking and video production sound editing, dialogue can be mapped to other speakers when story action and direction require it, such as when the person talking is off-screen, but it is rare that there is vocal content that is completely absent from the center channel.
In material without accompanying visuals (e.g. music), the center channel simply reproduces sound intended to come from immediately in front of the listener, which usually includes the lead vocals, which are rarely panned hard left or right. 
The center channel also anchors the sound field, eliminating phantom images such as those that plagued quadraphonic sound if the speakers were not precisely placed. 
The center channel eliminates the need of creating a phantom center with left and right stereo speakers. The center channel provides image stabling effects and is considered the most important channel for film production. 
History.
The need for a center speaker to locate screen-centered sounds has been recognised since the Bell labs experiments in stereo sound from the 1930s, and multi-channel cinema sound systems, starting with the first commercial stereophonic film (Fantasia-1941) have always included one. Post-war stereo sound in theaters initially came from separate magnetic film reproducers synchronised to the picture, but in the 1950s systems using magnetic stripes on the film itself came into use. Cinemascope used four such tracks (left, center, right and surround), and the subsequent Todd-AO 70mm system used six (left, left-center, center, right-center and right, plus a single surround channel). Unfortunately these magnetic systems were not only very expensive, but were also unreliable and so were little used, the industry preferring to stay with the tried, tested (and cheap) mono optical track.
Dolby Stereo was introduced by Dolby Laboratories in 1975. It divided the existing soundtrack area of a 35mm film print into two, allowing a two-channel recording. Each of these two channels used Dolby A type noise reduction (later replaced by Dolby SR type). In addition a matrix, similar in principle to those used for the existing matrix-type quadraphonic systems, allowed the audio for left, center and right speakers, plus a single surround channel to be carried by the two tracks. Thus Dolby Stereo provided a similar stereo performance to that previously only available in the cinema by the magnetic tracks on 4-track Cinemascope or 6-track Todd-AO (70mm) formats, but at far lower cost. 
In recent years digital multi-channel sound systems, such as Dolby Digital and DTS, have become available which provide 6 or 8 discrete audio channels providing for not only the usual three screen speakers but also 2 or 4 groups of surround speakers and a sub-woofer.
Center focus.
Many of the home theater units have a "center focus" option that provides options for the dialogue reproduction, as well as the overall content mapped to the center and front channels. Common setting include modes that map dialogue strictly to the center channel (to the best ability of the decoder), modes that emphasize vocals for clear dialogue—and modes that mix the center and front channels, mapping some vocals to the front channels, and some non-vocal audio content to the center channel. The center focus option, given the proper speaker arrangement, is designed to make the dialogue seem as if it is coming from inside the television, giving the effect that the actors are in the room speaking.
Rear/back center channel.
6.1 channel surround systems such as Dolby Pro Logic IIx, Dolby Digital EX and DTS-ES use a single rear surround channel in addition to the traditional left and right surround channels.

Emily Eden

Emily Eden (3 March 1797 – 5 August 1869) was an English poet and novelist who gave witty pictures of English life in the early 19th century. 
Born in Westminster, Eden was the seventh daughter of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, and his wife Eleanor Elliot. She was the great-great-great-aunt of Anthony Eden. In her youth, she and her sister Fanny travelled to India, where her brother George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland was in residence there as Governor-General from 1835 to 1842. She wrote accounts of her time in India, later collected in the volume "Up The Country: Letters Written to Her Sister from the Upper Provinces of India" (1867). She also wrote two very successful novels, "The Semi-Detached House" (1859) and "The Semi-Attached Couple" (1860). The latter was written in 1829 but not published until 1860. Both novels have a comic touch that critics have compared with Jane Austen, who was Emily's favorite author. In addition, her letters were published by Violet Dickinson, a close friend of Virginia Woolf. The letters contain some memorable comments on English public life, most famously her welcome for the new King William IV: "an immense improvement on the last unforgiving animal (George IV)—this man at least wishes to make everybody happy." 
Emily never married and was financially well-off enough that she did not need to write but did so out of passion for the art. After the death of Caroline Lamb, mutual friends hoped she might marry Lord Melbourne, who had become a close friend, although she claimed to find him "bewildering" and to be shocked by his profanity. Melbourne's biographer Lord David Cecil remarks that it might have been an excellent thing if they had married but "love is not the child of wisdom, and neither of them wanted to."

The Marvellous Land of Snergs

The Marvellous Land of Snergs is a children's fantasy, written by Edward Wyke Smith and published in 1927. It was illustrated by the "Punch" cartoonist George Morrow. It is noted as an inspiration source for Tolkien's "The Hobbit".
Plot summary.
"The Marvellous Land of Snergs" is set on a fictional island somewhere on Earth, but difficult to reach. On the island is a colony of children (rescued from neglect by the redoubtable Miss Watkyns), the crew of the "Flying Dutchman", and the Snergs, a race of short, thick-set, helpful people. Unfortunately Golithos, a reformed (but relapsing) ogre, and Mother Meldrum, a wicked witch, also live there. When Sylvia and Joe run away for a big adventure their lives are in deadly peril when they fall into the clutches of these two characters. Gorbo the Snerg and Baldry the court jester come to the rescue.
Snergs and Hobbits.
J. R. R. Tolkien, author of "The Hobbit" and "Lord of the Rings", is known to have read "The Marvellous Land of Snergs" to his children. He said: "I should like to record my own love and my children's love of E. A. Wyke-Smith's "Marvellous Land of Snergs", at any rate of the snerg-element of that tale, and of Gorbo the gem of dunderheads, jewel of a companion in an escapade."
The similarities between the races of snergs and hobbits have led to speculation that the book was a major inspiration. They are similar in their physical descriptions, their love of communal feasting, and their names, particularly Gorbo and Bilbo. In all the books there are also journeys through dangerous forests and underground caverns.
Reviews.
A recent review describes the book as "a classic fairy tale written in traditional style but with great gusto, whimsy and a surprising freshness." The review in "The Tolkien Collector" notes the points of similarity with "Peter Pan" – a remote island populated by disparate groups – and "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" – a haphazard plot and fantastic creatures. It criticizes the inconsistencies in the island story and the stylistic flaws which come from an over-awareness of the child audience, but considers that "Wyke-Smith transcends such superficial, dreamlike stories by creating a true fairy story, along the lines that were later elucidated by Tolkien".

Queensberry (band)

Queensberry is an all-female German pop group, founded in late 2008. Formed during the seventh season of the German version of the international television talent show "Popstars", "Popstars - Just 4 Girls", the original line-up consisted of singers Leonore Bartsch (Leo), Gabriella De Almeida Rinne (Gabby), Antonella Trapani (Anto), and Victoria Ulbrich (Vici). On 7 July 2010, it was announced that both Antonella and Victoria had left the group, to be replaced by new members, Selina Herrero and Ronja Hilbig.
The band's debut album "Volume I" was released in December 2008 and reached gold status in Germany. It produced the two singles No Smoke and "I Can't Stop Feeling", both becoming top thirty successes in the charts. In February 2008, Queensberry served as the opening act for The Pussycat Dolls's "World Domination Tour" in selected European countries. In November 2009, the second studio album "On My Own" was released.
For the soundtrack of the film ', Queensberry recorded ' with The Chipettes in December 2009, which reached number 6 in the U.S. Billboard charts, with the film soundtrack reaching number 1 in the U.S. soundtrack charts.
History.
Formation on "Popstars".
The Queensberry members were selected on the ProSieben channel's seventh installment of the "Popstars" series, entitled "Popstars - Just 4 Girls", which set about producing a four-piece girl group, following the initial success of previous all-female "Popstars" acts such as the No Angels (2000) and Monrose (2006). No stranger to "Popstars", Leonore Bartsch, who originates from Cologne, had already taken part in the Monrose season and was the last contestant to leave before the finale. In June and July 2008, over 2,300 hopefuls turned up to open auditions in Dortmund, Dresden, Hamburg and Rust which required both singing and dancing experience. The judges consisted of dancer and choreographer Detlef Soost, Dutch singer Loona and German rapper Sido. Danish singer Kate Hall served as this season's vocal coach.
After numerous elimination rounds, sixteen candidates flew to Sharm El Sheik, Egypt, where they intensified their training in singing, dancing, and fitness. In the end, twelve girls made it into the band house near Munich, of which six started work on the band's debut album. Beforehand, the top eight contestants, as "Popstars: Just 4 Girls", released the single "I Believe In X-Mas" promoted with a music video. Leo, German-Brazilian Gabriella De Almeida Rinne, who originates from Berlin, and Victoria Ulbrich, all managed to make it into the Queensberry line-up prior to the season's live finale in Hilversum, Netherlands, with all of them having won special stage performances, even though Victoria had had to go into hiatus for four weeks due to her mother's sudden death. Fourth member, Swiss-born, German-Italian, Antonella, was not announced until 18 December, when the show was resumed, based on her having sold most of her version of the group's debut album "Volume I" (which had been released in three different versions, a week prior to the finale, and featuring one finalist each) and her winning a public televoting over fellow campaigners Patricia Ivanauskas and Katharina Kobert (KayKay). Ironically, although each of the Queensberry girls had already performed together with all of their future bandmates (varying from duets to quartets), at some point throughout the season, it had never happened that all four of them made up one working group together. However, a couple of times, three of the future band members were featured in one quartet, but then with either Leo or Antonella not being part of it.
2008–2009: "Volume 1" and "On My Own".
With the final members of the group in place, the quartet signed a recording contract with Warner Music Group sub-label Starwatch Music. In January 2009, the album "Volume I" was certified gold by the IFPI, and in February, the band released their first main single, a double A-single consisting of the ballad "I Can't Stop Feeling" and their promotional song "No Smoke" - a cover version of the 2008 record by "Canadian Idol" winner Eva Avila. The single has also been covered by Nicki French. The song reached a moderate number 23 on the German Singles Chart, the lowest-chart peak for any "Popstars" winner's debut single, while "No Smoke" made it to the top thirty in Switzerland based on downloads only. In February 2009, the band served as the official opening act of The Pussycat Dolls' "World Domination Tour" in selected European countries such as Austria, Germany and the Netherlands. In June the same year, a deluxe edition of "Volume I" was released featuring additional tracks (including the "Too Young" single) and remixes.
On 6 May 2009, it was announced that the group was working on its second studio album. The track list included their previous summer song-single called "Too Young", the second album's first single "Hello (Turn Your Radio On)" and one song, which was performed live by former "Popstars - Just 4 Girls" participant Patricia, called "Scandalous". The album was released on 6 November 2009, with its promotional single "Hello (Turn Your Radio On)" released on 23 October 2009. This album was planned to be the band's first US-album. On 18 June 2010, the girls released two new songs as the soundtrack for the "Hanni und Nanni" movie, while their record contract with Warner Music in Germany was discontinued.
2010-2013: Line-up Changes and "Chapter 3".
On 7 July 2010, the group announced on its website that Anto and Vici had both departed from the group. [http://www.queensberry.de/news/2010-07-07/nachricht-von-queensberry] Selina Herrero, a German-Spanish singer from Bad Kreuznach in Germany, who first hit the German single charts in 2008 with "Don’t Be Shy" and "You Can’t Stop Me", and Ronja Hilbig, a singer from Hamburg, who had played the role of "Nala" in the German version of the musical "The Lion King" and had been a member of Die Lollipops, were brought in as new members. The first appearance of the new quartet was scheduled for 15 July 2010 on VIVA Live. The group made plans to shoot a reality show called "A Day in the Life of Queensberry" to be shown all over the USA. In October 2010, the group recorded its earlier single "I Can't Stop Feeling" in Spanish as "Yo No Puedo Vivir Sin Ti". The song, written by Teemu Brunila and Kid Crazy, and adapted for Spanish by José Valdes, was first performed on VIVA Live. On 3 December 2010, Queensberry announced it would make a label change and release an album in 2011. During spring and summer of 2011, the group performed throughout Germany on their "Pink Chocolate Tour".
The girls guest star on the album of German rapper KittyKat, and featured on a single called No Time For Suckers
In April 2012 it was announced that Selina Herrero left the band and went back to school. 
The remaining members released their third album, "Chapter 3", as a trio on June 22, 2012. The first single of the album, "Timeless", was released on June 1, 2012. Both album and single charted very low in the German Charts at 90 and 91 respectively. Despite failing at repeating their former successes, a music video for the second single "Girl Like You" was shot. The single was released on August 31, 2012 and became the first single of the group that failed to chart within the German Top 100. 
In August 2012, band member Leo had to drop out from several scheduled concerts of the band due to health issues. Therefore, De Almeida Rinne and Hilbig did several shows as a duo. In October 2012, Leo announced on her official website, that she has left the band. The remaining two members then decided to put future plans for the band on hold to focus on solo projects.

Anthony Hollander

Anthony Hollander (born 4 February 1964) is Professor of Rheumatology and Tissue Engineering at the University of Bristol where he is currently Head of School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine [http://www.bris.ac.uk/cellmolmed/]. On 19 November 2008 it was reported in the Lancet that an artificially-grown organ had been successfully transplanted into a woman in Barcelona, Claudia Castillo, a breakthrough in which Hollander played a key role as the only stem cell scientist on the team.
In 2009, Biddy Baxter, the editor of the children's television programme "Blue Peter" published a selection of children's letters received by the "Blue Peter" team. Amongst them was a letter from Hollander who had written in 1973 that he knew how to save lives. He now says that he owes his career to Miss Baxter: "If her letter had shown any hint of ridicule or disbelief I might perhaps never have trained to become a medical scientist or been driven to achieve the impossible dream, and really make a difference to a human being's life."
Hollander grew up in North West London, one of six children. He was a pupil at Christ's College Finchley and from there went to The University of Bath where he read for a degree in Pharmacology. He graduated with First Class Honours in 1987. He then moved to The University of Bristol where he undertook his doctoral research in the field of cartilage degradation in arthritis. He was awarded his PhD in 1990. 
He then moved to Montreal, Canada where he was a postdoctural scientist at McGill University for three years, again studying cartilage degradation in arthritis. In 1993 he was awarded a three-year Fellowship from The Arthritis Research Campaign (now Arthritis Research UK)http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org to be based in The University of Sheffield where he was appointed as lecturer. He was promoted to Reader in 1999 and he was then appointed to his Chair at The University of Bristol in 2000. He was elected as President of The International Cartilage Repair Society for the term of office May 2012 until September 2013.
Hollander is co-founder, Director and Chief Scientific Officer of Azellon Cell Therapeutics, a University of Bristol spin-out company funded to undertake the first clinical trial of stem cells for the treatment of torn knee cartilage. The two-year trial began in September 2012.

Transportation in Chicago

Chicago, Illinois is the third-largest city in the United States and a major transportation hub. The city is served by two major airports, and is the main freight rail hub of North America. 
Mass transit in much of the Chicago metropolitan area is managed through the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), which was installed by referendum in 1974. The RTA provides transportation services through the funding of three subordinate agencies: the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra, and Pace.
Airports.
There are several other smaller commercial airports in the Chicago area, these include:
General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee is also used by residents of Chicago's northern suburbs looking to avoid the congestion of the two main Chicago airports.
Transit systems.
Chicago Transit Authority.
The Chicago Transit Authority, or CTA, one of three service boards within the Regional Transportation Authority, operates the second largest public transportation system in the United States (to New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and covers the City of Chicago and 40 surrounding suburbs. The CTA operates 24 hours a day and, on an average weekday, 1.6 million rides are taken on the CTA.
CTA has approximately 2,000 buses that operate over 152 routes and 2,273 route miles (3,658 km). Buses provide about 1 million passenger trips a day and serve more than 12,000 posted bus stops. CTA's 1,190 rapid transit cars operate eight routes and of track. CTA trains provide about 745,000 customer trips each day and serve 144 stations in Chicago, Evanston, Skokie, Wilmette, Rosemont, Forest Park, Oak Park, and Cicero. The rapid transit system is known as the "Chicago 'L'" or variations of 'L', "El", or "el" to Chicagoans.
Chicago is one of the few cities in the United States that provides rapid transit service to two major airports. From the downtown area, the CTA's Blue Line takes riders to O'Hare International Airport in about 40 minutes, and the Orange Line takes customers to Chicago Midway International Airport in about 30 minutes from the Loop.
Bus services.
Suburban.
Pace, another service board within the Regional Transportation Authority, operates a primarily-suburban bus service that also offers some routes into Chicago.
Inter-city.
Several intercity bus companies offer service to other cities in Illinois and across the United States. Most operate to and from the Greyhound Lines terminal, located at 630 West Harrison Street (corner of Des Plaines Street). Greyhound Lines operates the majority of the inter-city bus service to and from Chicago, with routes connecting Chicago with Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Louisville, Nashville, Atlanta, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Washington, New York, Detroit, Toronto, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Madison, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Memphis, intermediate points, and connecting with other points beyond. Both Barons Bus Lines and Miller Transportation connect Chicago with Fort Wayne and Columbus. Indian Trails connects Chicago with Kalamazoo, Lansing, Flint, and Bay City. Burlington Trailways connects Chicago with Rockford, Dubuque, Davenport, Burlington, Des Moines, Omaha, and Denver.
Other inter-city bus companies use their own separate inter-city bus terminals. Megabus, a subsidiary of Coach USA, departs from a curbside bus stop near Union Station, on Canal Street south of Jackson Boulevard, and connects Chicago with Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Louisville, Nashville, Cleveland, Columbus, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Madison, Minneapolis, Des Moines, Omaha, St. Louis, Memphis, Kansas City, intermediate points, and connecting with other points beyond. Van Galder Bus Company, another subsidiary of Coach USA, departs from a curbside bus stop at Union Station, on Canal Street north of Jackson Boulevard, and connects Chicago with Rockford and Madison. Several bus companies catering to Hispanic passengers connect Chicago with points in Texas, and with connections throughout Mexico. These companies include El Expreso Bus Company, Omnibus Express, Los Paisanos Autobuses, Tornado Bus Company, and Turimex Internacional.
Rail services.
Commuter.
The Northeastern Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation, the third service board within the Regional Transportation Authority, and under its service mark Metra, operates eleven commuter rail lines that serve 200+ stations across the RTA's six-county service area. Unlike the 'L' lines, fare pricing is based on zones instead of a flat boarding fee. In addition, being mainly commuter rail service, frequent service is generally only provided during rush hours, although Metra is known for its speed and reliability. The eleven lines (while there are eleven lines, three of the lines also have service along additional branch lines; in addition to the main lines, the Metra Electric District has two branches, and the Rock Island District and Union Pacific Northwest have one branch each) connect into one of four different downtown stations: Union Pacific North, West, and Northwest arrive in the Richard B. Ogilvie Transportation Center (known more casually as the "North Western Station"); Milwaukee District North and West, North Central Service, SouthWest Service, BNSF Railway, and Heritage Corridor converge in Union Station (along with being the nexus of Amtrak); the Rock Island District arrives in the LaSalle Street Station; and the Metra Electric District arrives in Millennium Station (formerly Randolph Street Terminal).
The Metra Electric District is Chicago's oldest continuing commuter train (1856), and shares the railway with the South Shore Line, operated by the Northwest Indiana Commuter Transit District ("NICTD"), which is a separate but analogous quasi-governmental entity, partially funded by the RTA. The South Shore Line is an interurban railroad that operates between Chicago and South Bend, Indiana. Like the Metra Electric District, it arrives and departs from Millennium Station.
Inter-city.
Amtrak owns and operates Union Station which is a major intercity passenger rail hub with connections to Metra and the 'L.' Before Amtrak's takeover of passenger service in 1971, trains ran out of Central Station, Dearborn Station, LaSalle Street Station, Chicago and North Western Terminal as well as Union Station.
Tourist trolleys.
The City of Chicago offered free tourist trolleys that served the downtown area. The "trolleys" were actually buses painted to look like historical streetcars. They ran every 20 to 30 minutes and served areas popular with tourists that didn't have 'L' stations, such as the Museum Campus, Navy Pier, and the Magnificent Mile. The Free Trolley service was permanently discontinued in 2009.
The free trolleys shouldn't be confused with the private-sector Chicago Trolley Company, which offers guided tours and charge fares. They serve different routes but largely the same downtown area. Their vehicles are also buses rather than real trolleys.
Taxis.
Chicago is mandating that its entire fleet of taxicabs go green by January 1, 2014.
By water.
Shoreline Sightseeing offers water taxi service along the Chicago River with stops at Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, and Adams Street. They offer a separate route from Navy Pier to The Museum Campus. Shoreline Sightseeing also offers architecture cruises departing from Navy Pier.
Wendella Boats operates the Chicago Water Taxi which offers scheduled service along the Chicago River with stops at Michigan Avenue, Clark Street, (Ogilvie and Union train stations) Madison Street, and Chinatown. Ping Tom Park in Chinatown. Wendella Boats also offers architecture cruises departing from Michigan Avenue.
Bicycling.
Divvy, a Bicycle sharing system, is set to launch Summer 2013 with 4,000 bikes at 400 stations throughout the city.
Bicycles are permitted on CTA buses during all operating hours, and on CTA trains every weekday except from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.(during rush hour) On Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, bicycles are allowed on trains all day. If a person boards the train with his/her bicycle before the hours listed above and his/her trip extends into those hours, the CTA allows him/her to finish his/her trip. If trains are crowded, the use of trains by cyclists may be restricted by the rail operator as appropriate. Bicycles are not permitted on trains July 3 due to Independence Day celebrations. Folding bikes may be brought aboard CTA trains and buses during all operating periods, including rush hour.
A maximum of two bicycles are allowed per train car. For example, if the train is four cars in length, a total of eight bicycles are allowed on that train.
Transit operators have the discretion to deny access to anyone with a bike if they decide that conditions are too crowded. The CTA's entire bus fleet is now equipped with bike racks in front which can accommodate two bicycles. All CTA trains accept bicycles, although bikes were discouraged on the 2200-series rail cars with "blinker doors" (if they were turned sideways, they would look like a blinking eye when opening and closing). Only standard-size bicycles are allowed on all CTA vehicles; tandems are not allowed.

The 99th Flying Training Squadron (99 FTS) is part of the 12th Flying Training Wing based at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. It operates T-1 Jayhawk aircraft conducting flight training. The squadron was formed during World War II as the first flying unit for African Americans. Known as the Tuskegee Airmen the unit served with distinction in the European Theater of Operations. Following the war it served as a flight training unit for four years in the 1940s until its inactivation. It was re-activated in 1988 to once again fill a flight training role.
History.
World War II.
The 99th was originally formed as the Army Air Force's first African American fighter squadron, then known the 99th Pursuit Squadron. The personnel received their initial flight training at Tuskegee, Alabama earning them the nickname Tuskegee Airmen. The squadron was originally tentatively scheduled to fly air defense over Liberia but was diverted to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.
Considered ready for combat duty, the 99th was transported to Casablanca, Morocco, on the "USS Mariposa" and participated in the North African campaign. From Morocco they traveled by train to Oujda then to Tunis, the location from which they operated against the "Luftwaffe". Flyers and ground crew alike were isolated in their initial command, the 33d Fighter Group by the racial segregation practices of the Army and group commander Colonel William W. Momyer. The flight crews were handicapped by being left with little guidance from battle-experienced pilots except for a week spent with Colonel Philip Cochran. The 99th's first combat mission was to attack the small, but strategic, volcanic island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean Sea, in preparation for the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943. The 99th moved to Sicily where it received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its performance in combat.
Colonel Momyer, however, reported to NAAF Deputy Commander Major General John K. Cannon that the 99th was ineffective in combat and its pilots cowardly, incompetent, or worse, resulting in a critical article in "TIME". In response, the House Armed Services Committee convened a hearing to determine whether the Tuskegee Airmen experiment should be allowed to continue. Momyer characterized the 99th pilots of being incompetent because they had seen little air-to-air combat. To bolster the recommendation to scrap the project, a member of the committee commissioned and then submitted into evidence, a "scientific" report by the University of Texas that purported to prove that African Americans were of low intelligence and incapable of handling complex situations (such as air combat).
Colonel Benjamin Davis forcefully denied the claims by committee members, but only the intervention of Colonel Emmett "Rosie" O'Donnell prevented a recommendation for disbandment of the squadron from being sent to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. General Hap Arnold ordered an evaluation of all Mediterranean Theater P-40 units be undertaken to determine the true merits of the 99th; the results showed the 99th Fighter Squadron to be at least equal to other units operating the fighter.
While operating from North Africa the unit supported the reduction of enemy fortifications on Pantelleria and Tunisia.
The 99th supported Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy and provided close air support to the U.S. 5th Army during its assaults on Foggia and Anzio and for French and Polish armies in their attack on Monastery Hill near Cassino. On January 27 and 28, 1944, "Luftwaffe" Fw 190 fighter-bombers raided Anzio, where the Allies had conducted amphibious landings on January 22. Attached to the 79th Fighter Group, eleven of the 99th Fighter Squadron's pilots shot down enemy fighters, including Captain Charles B. Hall, who claimed two shot down, bringing his aerial victory total to three. The eight fighter squadrons defending Anzio together, claimed 32 German aircraft shot down, while the 99th claimed the highest score among them with 13.
The squadron earned its second Distinguished Unit Citation on May 12–14, 1944, while attached to the 324th Fighter Group, attacking German positions on Monastery Hill (Monte Cassino), attacking infantry massing on the hill for a counterattack, and bombing a nearby strong point to force the surrender of the German garrison to Moroccan Goumiers.
In mid-1944 the squadron was assigned to conduct bomber escort missions. The unit supported bomber missions over Romania, France, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia and Greece. For its efforts during the war the squadron was awarded three Distinguished Unit Citations.
Flying Training.
Following the war the squadron returned to the United States where it flew training missions until its inactivation in 1949. It was reactivated in 1988 as a flying training unit. With the closure of Williams Air Force Base, Arizona the squadron moved to Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. Today it operates T-1 Jayhawk aircraft preparing pilots to operate air refueling, airlift, and bomber aircraft.

Riccardo Pacifici

Riccardo Reuven Pacifici (18 February 1904 in Florence, Italy — 11 December 1943 in Auschwitz) was a rabbi from an Italian Jewish family of ancient Sephardic origins, with roots in the Jewish Spanish and rabbinical traditions.
Life.
Son of Mario Mordechai Pacifici and Gilda Borghi, descending from an ancient Sephardic and religious Jewish family of Spanish origin and of rabbinical tradition settled in Tuscany (first in Leghorn, then in Florence) in the 16th century.
After the "Liceo Classico" (Classical Studies High School) he attended the University of Florence where he graduated "summa cum laude" in Classics (Lettere Classiche) in 1926, and in 1927 he was awarded by the Rabbinical College of Florence—where he had studied under important scholars such as Elia Samuele Artom, Umberto Cassuto, Shemuel Zvi Margulies—the title of "Chachàm ha shalèm" (Senior Rabbi).
Vicerabbi of Venice from 1928 to 1930, director of the Rabbinical College of Rhodes from 1930, Great Rabbi of Rhodes until 1936, Chief Rabbi of the Genoa Jewish Community (Comunità Israelitica di Genova) from 1936 until deported by the Nazis in 1943.
Even during the difficult war years, he never stopped his spiritual and teaching activity. He continued his rabbinical duties between 1942 and 1943 with the Jewish refugees of the Ferramonti di Tarsia internment camp, located in Cosenza in the region of Calabria .
Unwilling to leave his Genoa Community and thus abandon his remaining members, Rav Pacifici was captured by deceit in 1943 by the Nazis and sent to Auschwitz, where he was killed with his wife Wanda Abenaim and many other members of the Pacifici family.
The "Largo Riccardo Pacifici" square in the heart of Genoa was named after him in 1966. He was the grandfather of the present Rome Jewish Community President Riccardo Pacifici.

Moxon Huddersfield

Moxon Huddersfield Ltd is a high-end British textile manufacturer of luxury worsted and woollen suiting fabrics. It is located at Yew Tree Mills, Holmbridge, near Holmfirth, Kirklees in Yorkshire.
History.
The company was incorporated in 1924 but claims it can trace its roots to the 16th century. In the 1910s, it traded under the name of "B. H. Moxon & Sons" and was located at Springfield Mills, Kirkburton, near Huddersfield. At that time it patented an improvement to the dobby loom. It was incorporated in 1924 In the 1930s, it was exporting to Japan and the United States. In 1950, it moved to a new site in Kirkburton.
In the 1950s, it was noted for its fancy worsted fabrics, In the 1980s, it was specialized in worsted mohair and silk blends aimed primarily at the Japanese market.
Moxon was one the first British weavers to replace British Dobcross looms with wider Swiss Sulzer looms. In the early 1960s, after the retirement of Matthew Moxon, it was part of the Tulketh Group, which went into receivership in the early 1970s. It was acquired in 1971 by the Allied Textiles group.
Today.
The company was acquired in 1993 by Firas Chamsi-Pasha, a Syrian former agent of Hield. Mr Chamsi-Pasha dropped 90% of the company's customer base and concentrated its production in the most expensive segment of the cloth market, with retail price up to £ 4,200 a metre in 2005 for fabrics such as a 12.9 micron wool or a super-fine wool with an 18 ct gold stripe. Mr Chamsi-Pasha marketed Super 180s fabrics in 1998 and Super 210s fabrics in 2000. He claimed in 2003 he was willing to pay "silly prices" to acquire wool with a fiber measuring less than 12 microns and had bought 26 pounds of wool with a fiber measuring 11.5 microns. The company uses antique machinery together with up-to-date equipment, such as a £120,000 scouring machine. 
In 2006, Joanne Alsop, then head designer of the company, won a Silver Shuttle Award from the Worshipful Company of Weavers. As of 2010, the company was using 8 looms and producing about 500 single pieces or 35,000 metres per year, using archives going back to the 1930s for ideas. As of 2011, its fabric are priced between £300 ($480) and £11,000 ($17,600) per metre. 95% of the production is exported.
Cashmere Socks.
In 1999, the company introduced socks woven with a very fine cashmere from the Altai region. They were priced at £400 ($640) in 2011. The company claims to sell 140 pairs per year.

NCAA Men's Division I Football Championship Subdivision alignment history

This article depicts the NCAA Men's Football Championship Subdivision Alignment History—specifically, all schools that have competed in the lower tier of NCAA Division I college football since Division I football was split into two subdivisions in 1978. This includes schools competing in:
Teams in bold italics are now in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS); those in "plain italics" either play football in lower divisions or not at all. Teams followed by an asterisk (*) dropped football.
Dates reflect when a team began play in I-AA/FCS, not when it became eligible for postseason play.
As of the upcoming 2014 season, only one team that is transitioning from FCS to FBS will be classified as an FCS member—Charlotte. That school began a football program for the first time in 2013, at the same time it became a full but initially non-football member of the FBS-level Conference USA. Charlotte is playing as an FCS independent in both 2013 and 2014 before becoming a full FBS member in 2015. Three other schools that began FBS transitions in 2013—Appalachian State, Georgia Southern, and Old Dominion—will be provisional FBS members in 2014 and full FBS members in 2015. The article reflects these dates.
Three other schools were classified as FCS members in 2013, but did not play FCS schedules. Abilene Christian and Incarnate Word, which began the reclassification process from Division II to Division I in 2013, played Division II schedules that season. Houston Baptist began a football program in 2013 and played a partial schedule. All three schools, which joined the Southland Conference for non-football sports in July 2013, will play full Southland schedules in 2014. Abilene Christian and Incarnate Word will be ineligible for the FCS playoffs until the 2017 season.
School names reflect those in current use, not necessarily those used by a school when it competed in I-AA/FCS. Specifically, three schools were known by different names throughout their entire tenure in Division I-AA/FCS:

Erez Lieberman Aiden

Erez Lieberman Aiden (formerly known as Erez Lieberman) is an American research scientist active in multiple fields related to applied mathematics. He is a fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows and visiting faculty member at Google. Using mathematical and computational approaches, he has studied evolution in a range of contexts, including that of networks through evolutionary graph theory and languages in the field of culturomics. He has published scientific articles in a variety of disciplines.
Lieberman Aiden has won awards including the Lemelson–MIT Student Prize and the American Physical Society's Award for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research in Biological Physics. In 2009, Lieberman Aiden was named as one of 35 top innovators under 35 by "Technology Review" and in 2011 he was one of the recipients of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers.
Early life and education.
Born in 1980, Erez Lieberman Aiden grew up in Brooklyn with three siblings. He began computer programming at the age of seven. His father, Aharon Lieberman, was a technology entrepreneur and owned a factory in New Jersey. As a child Lieberman Aiden spoke Hebrew and Hungarian, making English his third language.
Lieberman Aiden studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at Princeton, and earned a Master's degree in History at Yeshiva University. He proceeded to complete a joint PhD in mathematics and bioengineering at the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, where he was advised by Eric Lander and Martin Nowak.
Research.
Lieberman Aiden contributed to the founding of evolutionary graph theory along with his PhD supervisor Martin Nowak. He has since been involved in researching the three dimensional structure of the human genome and the field of culturomics.
Three-dimensional genome structure.
Lieberman Aiden was part of a team of scientists from the University of Massachusetts Medical School and MIT that first suggested human DNA folds into a fractal globule rather than an equilibrium globule. This finding explains how each cell's genome is able to be heavily compacted without forming a knot. Lieberman Aiden and coworkers invented a variant of chromosome conformation capture called "Hi-C" which produces a genome-wide measure of contact probabilities that point to a 3-dimensional genome structure. This technique combines existing chromosome capture methodology with next-generation sequencing, enabling an all-versus-all measure of chromatin contacts.
In 2009 this work was published in the journal "Science" and was featured as a cover illustration. Following the publication, Lieberman Aiden was quoted as saying:
Culturomics.
Lieberman Aiden was involved in the analysis of a corpus of around 5 million digitised books, applying data mining techniques to advance the new field of culturomics. Leiberman Aiden was involved in a project to digitise Anglo-Saxon texts in 2004, the analysis of which lead to the discovery of verb regularisation, a process whereby irregular verbs become increasingly regular over time. 
After the announcement of Google Books, Lieberman Aiden approached Google's Director of Research Peter Norvig and was permitted to statistically analyse their data. His work contributed to the Google Ngram Viewer, released in December 2010, which makes use of culturomics ideas to produce normalized historical trends for any sequence of letters. This project published a number of findings in the journal "Science", including the changing dynamic of fame and instances of literary censorship during the Second World War.
Awards.
In 2008 Lieberman Aiden was awarded the Lemelson-MIT Student Prize for his work on the iShoe, meant to assist elderly people with balance problems and prevent falls that could cause injury. The following year, the iShoe was listed as one of "20 New Biotech Breakthroughs that Will Change Medicine" by "Popular Mechanics". A year later Lieberman Aiden was named as one of 35 top innovators under 35 (TR35) by MIT's "Technology Review" magazine.
In 2010, the American Physical Society presented Lieberman Aiden with the Award for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research in Biological Physics for his thesis titled "Evolution and the emergence of structure". His doctoral dissertation was also awarded the Hertz Thesis Prize. Lieberman Aiden was named, along with 95 other American researchers, as a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2011.
Personal life.
Erez Lieberman Aiden married Aviva Presser Aiden in 2005; following the marriage both husband and wife appended "Aiden" to their surnames. They have a son named Gabriel Galileo and a daughter. Outside of scientific interests, Lieberman Aiden participated in a modern art collaboration with Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick which was exhibited in galleries in the United States and Europe.
Lieberman Aiden and his wife founded Bears Without Borders, a nonprofit organisation which distributes stuffed toys to the developing world.

Murray loop bridge

Murray loop bridge is a bridge circuit used for locating faults in underground or underwater cables. It has been used for more than 100 years. 
One end of the faulted cable is connected through a pair of resistors to the voltage source. Also a null detector is connected. The other end of the cable is shorted. The bridge is brought to balance by changing the values of "RB1" and "RB2", which is achieved when:
formula_1
which is equivalent to:
formula_2
The value of resistance "Rx" is proportional the length "Lx", thus the location of the fault can be calculated:
formula_3
where "L" is the total length of the cable under test - a value proportional to "Rg".
The method assumes a single fault exists, of low resistance compared with the undamaged cable insulation resistance, and that the cable conductors have uniform resistance per unit length. 
Varley loop.
The similar Varley loop uses fixed resistors for RB1 and RB2, and inserts a variable resistor in the faulted leg. Test sets for cable testing can be connected for either bridge technique. If the fault resistance is high, the sensitivity of the Murray bridge is reduced and the Varley loop may be more suitable.

MS Awazisan Maru

The Awazisan Maru, also known as "Awajisan Maru" or "Awagisan Maru" was a 9,794 gross ton freighter that was built by Tama Shipbuilding Co., Tamano for Mitsui & Co. Ltd. launched in 1939 and was notable for being the most advanced freighter of its time. It was commissioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy to transport troops in World War II and was part of the Japanese Invasion of Malaya on December 8, 1941. 
Along with its sister ships "Ayatosan Maru" and "Sakura Maru", it was carrying around 5,000 troops during the landings at Kota Bharu. "Awazisan Maru" was bombed by a Lockheed Hudson aircraft of No. 1 Squadron RAAF, set afire and was abandoned to drift. It is believed that the freighter sunk or was subsequently torpedoed by the Dutch submarine K-XII.
The invasion of Malaya preceded the attack on Pearl Harbor by an hour and a half, making it the first Japanese campaign of World War II, likely making the "Awazisan Maru" the very first casualty in the war. 
"Awazisan Maru" now lies in of water off the coast of Pantai Sabak in Kota Bharu and is fast becoming a popular diving destination due to its remarkable history. It is more popularly known amongst local divers as the "Japanese Invasion Wreck".

Charles Grafton Page

Charles Grafton Page (in Salem, Massachusetts January 25, 1812 – May 5, 1868 in Washington, D.C.) was an American electrical experimenter and inventor, physician, patent examiner, patent advocate, and professor of chemistry.
Like his more famous contemporaries Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry, Page began his career as an astute natural philosopher who developed innovative work with natural phenomena through direct observation and experimenting. Toward the later part of their careers, the science of the day had moved on to a more mathematical emphasis in which these scientists did not participate.
Through his exploratory experiments and distinctive inventions, Page developed a deep understanding of electromagnetism. He applied this understanding in the service of the US Patent Office, in support of other inventors, and in pursuing his own ill-fated dream of electromagnetic locomotion. His work had a lasting impact on telegraphy and in the practice and politics of patenting scientific innovation, challenging the rising scientific elitism that maintained 'the scientific do not patent'.
Family life.
Charles Grafton Page was born to Captain Jere Lee Page and Lucy Lang Page on January 25, 1812 in Salem, Massachusetts. Having eight siblings, four of each gender, he was the only one of five sons to pursue a career into mature adulthood. One of his brothers died in infancy. Brother George died from typhoid at age sixteen, brother Jery perished on a sea expedition to the Caribbean at age twenty-five, and Henry, afflicted by poliomyelitis, was not able to support himself. In writing to Charles Grafton during his final voyage, Jery expressed the family’s hope for his success: "You are the only classical Page in our book."
Page's curiosity about electricity was evident from childhood. At age nine, he climbed on top of his parents' house with a fire-shovel in an attempt to catch electricity during a thunderstorm. At age ten, he built an electrostatic machine that he used to shock his friends. At sixteen, Page developed the "portable electrophorus," which served as the foundation for his first published article in the "American Journal of Science"(Page, 1834).
Other early interests, including botany, entomology (Page, 1836b), and floriculture, contributed to his scientific training and later avocations.
After graduating from medical school, Page continued to reside in his parents' Salem home and opened a small medical practice. In a well-stocked lab that he set up there, he experimented with electricity, demonstrated effects that no one had observed before, and improvised original apparatus that amplified these effects.
When his father retired from a successful career as a sea captain in trade with East India, Page joined his family in relocating to rural Virginia outside Washington DC. 
Page married Priscilla Sewall Webster in 1844. Priscilla was the younger sister of the wife of a Washington physician, Harvey Lindsly, who was among Page's colleagues. One son died in infancy. The couple brought up three sons and two daughters. Their oldest daughter, Emelyn or Emmie, died less than a year before Page's own death. Their youngest son, Harvey Lindsly Page (1859–1934), was named for his uncle. He was a famous American architect and inventor, of San Antonio, Texas. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpa75
Career.
Page pursued undergraduate studies at Harvard College from 1828–1832, studying chemistry under Professor John White Webster. A classmate at Salem Latin School who also attended college and medical school with him, Henry Wheatland described Page as popular, fun-loving, athletic, a fine singer and "a loved companion". Page participated in organizing a college chemical club where he demonstrated electricity and other phenomena. After receiving an M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1836, he practiced medicine and gave public lectures on chemistry in Salem.
When Page moved to northern Virginia in 1838, he continued his experimental research and set up a medical practice which he sustained for several years.
Page served as a patent examiner in the United States Patent Office in Washington, D.C. for two periods: 1842-1852 and 1861-1868. He became senior patent examiner during his first term. During the years intervening, he took up a business as a patent agent or solicitor to help other inventors secure patents, established and edited the short-lived "The American Polytechnic Journal", and pursued his own interests in electromagnetism, floriculture and other areas. As a patent agent, Page handled up to 50 successful patents a year, including patents for Eben Norton Horsford, Walter Hunt and others. Page's 1861 return to the Patent Agency as an examiner occurred in the wake of numerous dismissals of patent office employees under the new Administration of Abraham Lincoln.
Page figured as a key witness in the Morse v. O'Reilly telegraph lawsuit of 1848. However, when Morse sought an extension of his patent on telegraph apparatus twelve years later, Page refuted Morse's role as inventor and was perhaps influential in the extensions' denial.
From 1844-1849, Page was Professor of Chemistry and in the Medical Department at Columbian College in Washington, D.C. (presently George Washington University).
He held other public roles such as that of advising the choice of stone to be used in constructing the Smithsonian Institution and the Washington Monument to the committees in charge of these projects.
Throughout his life, Page published more than one-hundred articles over the course of three distinct periods: the late 1830s, the mid-1840s, and the early 1850s. The first period (1837–1840) was especially crucial in developing his analytic skills. Over 40 of his articles appeared in the "American Journal of Science" edited by Benjamin Silliman; some of these were reprinted at the time in William Sturgeon’s "Annals of Electricity, Magnetism, and Chemistry" printed in Great Britain. The "Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers" (1800–1863 volume) records many of Page's papers, however this listing is incomplete, as is that provided in (Post, 1976a, p. 207-213).
Scientific accomplishments.
While still a medical student at Harvard, Page conducted a ground-breaking experiment which demonstrated the presence of electricity in an arrangement of a spiral conductor that no one had tried before. His experiment was a response to a short paper by Joseph Henry, announcing that a strong electric shock was obtained from a ribbon strip of copper, spiralled up between fabric insulation, at the moment when battery current stopped running in this conductor. These strong shocks manifested the electrical property of self-inductance which Faraday had identified in researches published prior to Henry's, building on his own landmark discovery of electromagnetic induction. Page seemed to be unaware of 
Faraday's analysis.
Page's innovation was to construct a spiral conductor having cups filled with mercury (element) as electrical connectors that were placed at various positions along its length. He then connected one terminal from an electrochemical cell battery to the inner cup of the spiral, and put the other battery terminal into some other cup of the spiral. The direct battery current flowed through the spiral, from cup to cup. He held a metal wand in each hand, and put these wands into the same two cups as where the battery terminals went — or any other pair of cups. When an assistant removed one of the battery terminals, stopping the current from going in the spiral, Page received a shock. He reported stronger shocks when his hands covered more of the spiral's length than where direct battery current went. He even felt shocks from parts of the spiral where no direct battery current passed. He used acupuncture needles, pierced into his fingers, to amplify his sense of shock. 
While Page advocated the use of this shocking device as a medical treatment, an early form of electrotherapy, his own interest lay in its heightening of electrical tension, or voltage above that of the low voltage battery input, and in its other electrical behaviors. Page went on to improve the instrument, giving it the name 'Dynamic Multiplier'.
In order for Page's instrument to produce the shock, the battery current had to be stopped. In order to experience another shock, the battery had to be started again, and then stopped. Page invented the first interrupters, to provide a repeatable means of connecting and disconnecting the circuit. In these devices, electrical flow is started and stopped as a rocking or rotary motion lifts electrical contacts out of a mercury pool. An electric motor effect is responsible for the continued operation of the switch.
Crucial to Page's research with the spiral conductor was his capacity to explore and question the unknown, where the physical effects were enigmatic and the 'received theories' inadequate. Page did not provide an explanation for what he found, yet he extended and amplified the apparatus and its unexpected behaviors. A recent reconstruction of Page's experiment corroborates the central role of ambiguity in his work, finding:
Page's publication about his spiral instrument was well received in the American science community and in England, putting him into the upper ranks of American science at the time.
British experimenter William Sturgeon reprinted Page's article in his journal "Annals of Electricity". Sturgeon provided an analysis of the electromagnetic effect involved; Page drew on and expanded Sturgeon's analysis in his own later work. Sturgeon devised coils that were adaptations of Page's instrument, where battery current flowed through one, inner, segment of a coil, and electrical shock was taken from the entire length of a coil.
Through the input from Sturgeon, as well as his own continuing researches, Page developed coil instruments that were the foundation for the eventual induction coil. These instruments had two wires. One wire, termed the "primary", carried battery current; a shock was taken across the ends of the other much longer wire, termed the "secondary" (see transformer). The primary wire was wound concentrically over an iron core; the secondary was wound over that. Page developed a deep understanding of the underlying behaviors. In Page's published account of his coil, he termed it 
and its contact breaker the 'Compound Electro-Magnet and 
Electrotome'. Page's patent model for this coil is presently on display at the National Museum of American History.
In a subsequent experiment with a spiral conductor, Page mounted it rigidly between the poles of a suspended horseshoe magnet. When current stopped flowing in the spiral, a tone could be heard from the magnet, which Page termed 'galvanic music'. Thirty years later, Alexander Graham Bell cited Page's galvanic music as an important precedent for his development of telephony.
An astute observer and exploratory experimenter, Page invented many other electromagnetic devices. Some of these involved the electromagnetic motor effect in original ways. Many prototypes devised by Page were turned into products manufactured and marketed by Boston instrument-maker Daniel Davis, Jr., the first American to specialize in magnetic philosophical instruments.
While consulting with Samuel F.B. Morse and Alfred Lewis Vail on the development of apparatus and techniques, Page contributed to the adoption of suspended wires using a ground return, designed a signal receiver magnet and tested a magneto as a source to substitute for the battery.
During the 1840s, Page developed what he termed the Axial Engine. This instrument used an electromagnetic solenoid coil to draw an iron rod into its hollow interior. The rod's displacement opened a switch that stopped current from flowing in the coil; then being unattracted, the rod reverted out of the coil, and this cycle repeated again. The resulting reciprocating motion of the rod back and forth, into and out of the coil, was converted to rotary motion by the mechanism. After demonstrating uses of this engine to run saws and pumps, Page successfully petitioned the U.S. Senate for funds to produce an electromagnetic locomotive, based on this design.
With these funds plus personal resources that took him into debt, Page built and tested the first full-sized electromagnetic locomotive, preceded only by the 1842 battery-powered model-sized "Galvani" of Scottish inventor Robert Davidson. Along the way, Page constructed a series of motors, revisions of the axial engine having different dimensions and mechanical features, which he tested thoroughly. The motor operated on large electrochemical cells, acid batteries having as electrodes zinc and costly platinum, with fragile clay diaphragms between the cells. Page's 1850 American Association for the Advancement of Science presentation about his progress impressed Joseph Henry, Benjamin Silliman and other leading scientists. 
On April 29, 1851, Page conducted a full test, intending to run the 21,000 pound locomotive from Washington DC to Baltimore and back with passengers on board. Problems immediately arose. High voltage sparks, resulting from the very effect Page had investigated with the spiral conductor, broke through the electrical insulation of the electrical coils, resulting in short circuits. Many of the battery's fragile clay dividers cracked on starting up; others broke down subsequently. Page and his mechanic Ari Davis struggled to make repairs and keep the locomotive running. With some periods of steady running, the silent engine (by comparison to a steam locomotive) traveled 5 miles to Bladensburg, Maryland, attaining a top speed of 19 miles per hour. Page prudently reversed direction there, for what was an arduous, calamity-laced return to the National Capitol.
The failures of Page's electromagnetic locomotive test run were cautionary to other inventors who eventually found other means than batteries to produce electrically driven locomotion. Before Page began his attempt, work such as that of James Prescott Joule had generated a general consensus among scientists that "the battery powered motor was a hopelessly impractical device". Page had disregarded those findings. He himself never gave up believing in the practical potential of 
his design.
A century and a half after Page's locomotive, the technology of Battery electric vehicles is demonstrating applications in numerous transportation contexts.
Science and Pseudoscience.
Comfortable himself in public performance as a popular lecturer and singer, being skilled in ventriloquism as well, Page was astute in detecting the misuse of performative acts in defrauding a gullible public. One class of fraudulent schemes prevalent at the time involved communications with spirits by means of rapping sounds, the motion of a table, or other such signs produced in the vicinity of the perpetrator-medium. The sounds and motions were attributed to occult forces and forms of electricity. The Fox sisters, of Rochester New York, made these claims notorious by exhibiting in public and private settings, while collecting money from their audiences.
Investigating some of these performers in person, Page produced a book that exposes various means of deception they employed (Page, 1853a). He described his analysis of these techniques during a sitting with the Fox sisters. Each time a critical observer peered under the table around which the sisters were seated, the spirit rapping ceased; whenever the observer sat upright, the sounds recommenced. Page asked to have the spirit sounds displayed elsewhere than via the table. One sister climbed into a wardrobe closet. Page identified where her long dress (concealing a stick or other apparatus) contacted the wardrobe. Through his expert knowledge of ventriloquism, Page detected how this performer was misdirecting the viewer's attention away from the actual source of the sound while building expectations to suppose the sound came from elsewhere than the source. However the trick was "poorly done" and the girl could not control it so as to produce any spirit communication.
Going on to reveal other fraudulent practices, Page addressed the relationship at work between performer and audience by which both functioned as perpetrators:
Page's efforts to expose these frauds at their human roots stems in part from his keen concern for furthering the public understanding of science and their proficient use of its findings and benefits. In this undertaking, Page allied with contemporary Michael Faraday and other scientists throughout history who have sought to debunk the unscrupulous applications of pseudoscience upon a willing and gullible public.
Controversy and Impact from Politics, War, and Patents.
As with the challenge to spiritualism described above, Page's scientific undertakings brought him into public arenas where politics and controversy held sway. Eloquent, combative, keen-minded and persistent, Page made his commitments known. Increasingly, Page's self-chosen and sometimes self-serving commitments diverged from the norms of behavior sanctioned by society and the elitism of the emerging professionalist trend in science. The resulting tarnish to Page's reputation impacted him during his lifetime and contributed to the longstanding historical neglect of his scientific work and personal story, thereby reducing general understanding of the complexity of the American experience in science.
A tension early to arise in his career as patent examiner was that of the conflict of interest between the privileged information he had regarding applicants' patents, and his private consulting with particular inventors on the side. Following his appearance in the 1848 Morse v O'Reilly lawsuit over the telegraph, Page took a more careful stance in his role as patent examiner. Thereafter, he refrained from transmitting such privileged information to rival patent applicants.
However, the well-paid public post of patent examiner put the occupants continually under scrutiny by politicians, scientists, and aspiring inventors. Both Congress and the executive branch exerted control and influence over policy and practices in the patent office.
In the early years of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, a patent examiner was expected to be highly trained, knowledgeable in all the sciences, informed on current and past technology. Page was an exemplar of this ideal.
As Page continued in the job, the number of patents submitted to the agency increased sharply, while the number of patents granted was the same or less, and the number of patent examiners was unchanged. Inventors seeking patents, becoming incensed about decisions made against them, coalesced into a lobby with a voice projected through the journal Scientific American. This lobby advocated "liberalization" — more leniency in the granting of patents, giving the inventor the "benefit of the doubt"— and argued against the scientific research being sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution under Joseph Henry.
Henry took a hard line, decrying inventors' "futile attempts to innovate and improve". The elite professionalized science that Henry was building up through the Smithsonian and other organizations treated as low status the having or seeking of a patent; patents were not considered a contribution to science. While Page set out to show that gaining patents was genuine scientific work, he fell out of favor with the scientific establishment. His friendship with Henry petered out, and Page was no longer held in high regard as part of elite science.
Page shifted in his position on the granting of patents. As an examiner of patents, he was scrupulous and fair. Through his own experience as an inventor and association with other inventors, he allied with their concerns. On his resignation from the patent agency, Page used the journal he founded and edited as a forum to critique and even lambast the agency and policies which he had upheld for 10 years prior. 
Following the example of Samuel Morse, who developed the telegraph to commercial viability through assistance from federal government funds, Page sought a similar level of support for his electromagnetically powered locomotive. He found a political ally in Thomas Hart Benton, senator from Missouri. Benton's passionate rhetoric on behalf of Page's vision was instrumental in securing unanimous support for a Senate allocation of $20,000 to fund Page's project through the Department of Navy. By the end of that year (1849), Page reported to the Navy that he was collaborating on the project with a mechanic, Ari Davis, the brother of Daniel Davis Jr., but had nothing yet to show. In print, inventor Thomas Davenport (inventor) challenged the expenditure of public funds on Page's project, claiming that motors he had already invented and built were equal to the task. Page defused that objection by publishing a statement about his unique device.
More troubles ensued for the project. Running low on cash, Page asked for more. Speaking in the Senate in the summer of 1850, Benton presented Page's attainment of a force an order of magnitude greater than what the same battery had output under his initial trials. Benton upped the stakes by requesting funds for Page to develop an electromagnetically powered ship of war. This second petition met with serious opposition in the Senate. Senator Henry Stuart Foote countered that Page had not proved substantial progress or benefits from his work. Senator Jefferson Finis Davis objected to the appropriation of government funds to one inventor, while 
other inventors such as Thomas Davenport went unsupported. Both the US Senate and House nixed any further funds for Page's project. In order to prepare the locomotive for its 1851 trial run, Page went over $6000 into debt. In the wake of the failed public test of this locomotive, Page faced a critical press. Gaining no assistance from the world of finance, he emerged from the debacle in "desperate straights, financially and 
emotionally".
The American Civil War wreaked a further devastating impact on Page's scientific work and legacy. In 1863, Union soldiers stationed in the area of Page's home, broke into his laboratory as a random, unprovoked act of violence. His equipment, inventions and laboratory notebooks were destroyed. Some other inventions by Page which he had donated to the Smithsonian Institution were destroyed by a fire there in 1865. As a result of these destructive events, very few of Page's handmade devices exist today. With little remaining of his experimental work and notes, Page's many contributions have slipped from the view of most historians.
Suffering debt, terminal illness and isolation from the mainstream scientific community by his last years, Page contrived one final effort to secure credit and status for his achievements. In 1867, he petitioned the United States Congress for a retrospective patent on his inventions of the late 1830s: the spiral conductor, the circuit breakers, the double helical coil. The granting of such a patent transgressed such policies as that an invention in widespread public use for decades can not be patented, and that an employee of the Patent office can not hold a patent. Page circumvented these policies by appealing to nationalism. To support his argument, he published anonymously a lengthy, closely researched yet self-promoting book titled "The American Claim to the Induction Coil and its electrostatic Developments"(1867b).
By the 1860s, the induction coil was becoming a prominent instrument of physics research. Instrument-makers in America, Great Britain and the European continent contributed in developing the construction and operation of induction coils. Premiere among these instrument makers was Heinrich Daniel Ruhmkorff, who in 1864 received from Emperor Napoleon III the prestigious Volta Prize along with a 50,000 franc award for his 'invention' of the induction coil. Page maintained that the devices he developed in the 1830s were not markedly different from the induction coil and that other American inventors had filled in with improvements that were better than anything made by Ruhmkorff — and alleging that Ruhmkorff had plagiarized the coil of another American instrument-maker, Edward Samuel Ritchie.
A special act passed by the U.S. House and Senate, and signed by President Andrew Johnson authorized what was later dubbed "The Page Patent". Page died a few weeks later, in May 1868. Instead of dying with him, the Page patent went on to play a major role in the politics and economics of the telegraph industry. Page's lawyer and heirs successfully argued that the patent covered the mechanisms involved in "all known forms of telegraphy". An interest in the patent was sold to the Western Union Co; together Western Union and the Page heirs reaped lucrative benefits. Page's patent secured a life 'in style' 
for his widow and heirs. Although he was no longer living, it figured as yet another violation, on his part, of the behavior code under the emerging professionalization of science of the day, under which science was to be conducted for its own sake, without accruing apparent political or financial gain.

Frederique Trunk was born in Colmar, France and graduated in 1986 from the Conservatoire de Music de Strasbourg with honors in piano, ear training and theory. She earned a Certificate of Chamber Music and Sight Reading and graduated with a diploma in musicology from the Universite des Sciences Humaines de Strasbourg. 
In 1992, Frederique went to New York City to study jazz piano and harmony at the New School's Jazz and Contemporary Music Program with Kenny Werner, Fred Hersch and Maria Schneider. She has studied jazz piano and composition privately Art Resnick, Richie Beirach and Kirk Nurock as well as William Allaudin Mathieu and perfected her classical piano technique and teaching skills with Madeline Bruser.
As a soloist and bandleader, Frederique has toured in Europe, Japan, Morocco, The United States, Canada and most recently, Barcelona, Spain. She has worked with, and been influenced by many musical combinations from solo piano to quartets as well as larger groups such as salsa bands.
In 1996, Frederique formed a duet with Lebanese pianist Ramzi Moufarej. A year later they formed the musical collaboration "Myriade". Using an unusual combination of two pianos, cello, the oud and percussion, their album "Soukoun" was released in the spring of 2001.
In 1998 she formed her subsequent group, "Frederique's Trio" which presented a blend of Jazz standards and French songs. She completed her first album "Secret Love" in December 1999. In 2006 she released her "Paris, New York...and Elsewhere".
In addition to writing for her Jazz trio and "Myriade", Frédérique has been composing works for small ensembles and orchestra combining Classical and Jazz concepts enriched by her diverse interests and influences. "Paysages Mouvants" (Moving Landscapes), her piece for orchestra and Jazz trio, debuted to an enthusiastic audience in Florence Gould Hall at the New York French Institute Alliance Française, March 19, 2000. The Florence Gould Foundation then commissioned her to create another orchestral piece, "Ombres et Miroirs" (Shadows and Reflections), for strings, piano and percussion, that premiered February 6, 2002 at Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, New York. A new piece ordered by Jean Pierre Schmitt -director of the French American Conservatory in New York- ESPERA, Ballad for alto saxophone and chamber orchestra was premiered with saxophonist Javier Oviedo (www.ovittmusic.com) in November 2010 at St Peter Church in New York.
In January 1999, Frédérique was the composer and musical director for the La Mama production, "The Banquet of the Beheaded", a play by Nicola L. In December 2000, she composed and performed her first film score for "The Sandman". David Teague's silent film, based on the tale by E.T.A. Hoffman, won First Prize at The New York International Independent Film and Video Festival in 2001. The complete score was released on CD in September 2001.
Frédérique has been teaching classical & jazz Piano, improvisation, music theory, harmony and composition in various music schools in France, privately, and from 1993 to 2006, at the French American Conservatory of Music at Carnegie Hall, New York, NY.
In May 2006, she moved to Barcelona, Spain to explore more horizons and continue to transform both her music and herself. At the beginning of 2008 she formed the group "Resonessence" (inspired by the concept of the group Myriade she had in New York) who's essence is to create a unified sound made of many voices and different cultural influences with an unusual instrumentation: piano & voice, oud, clarinet & bass clarinet, cello and percussion. (www.myspace.com/resonessence)
In the same idea of fusion of styles, she wrote an arrangement for piano and voice of the Livre Vermeil de Montserrat (Catalan medieval music) inspired by jazz and contemporary music, which she performed at the International Jazz Festival of Barcelona in November 2008.
In 2009 Frédérique started collaborating with tapdancer Roxane Butterfly for the project "Mood Danza" performed at the Festival Arte Donne in Turino, and at the Festival Mediterraneo in Genova (Italy). A new version of the show was presented at Joe’s Pub in New York, July 31, 2010.

<doc id="20295007" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20295007" title="Work engagement">
Work engagement

Modern organizations need energetic and dedicated employees: people who are engaged with their work. These organizations expect proactivity, initiative and responsibility for personal development from their employees. Overall, engaged employees are fully involved in, and enthusiastic about their work.
Kahn was the first scholar to define “personal engagement” as the “…harnessing of organization member’s selves to their work roles: in engagement, people employ and express themselves physically, cognitively, emotionally and mentally during role performances” (p. 694). Based on this definition a questionnaire was developed that assesses three dimensions: cognitive, emotional and physical engagement.
Nowadays, there are two different schools of thought with regard to the definition of work engagement. On the one hand Maslach and Leiter () assume that a continuum exists with burnout and engagement as two opposite poles. 
The second school of thought operationalizes engagement in its own right as the positive antithesis of burnout. According to this approach, work engagement is defined as a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. Vigor is characterized by high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one’s work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties; dedication by being strongly involved in one's work, and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge; and absorption by being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one’s work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work.
Work engagement as a unique concept.
Work engagement as measured by the UWES is positively related with, but can nevertheless be differentiated from, similar constructs such as job involvement and organizational commitment, in-role and extra-role behavior; personal initiative, Type A, and workaholism. Moreover, engaged workers are characterized by low levels of burnout, as well as by low levels of neuroticism and high levels of extraversion. Also they enjoy good mental and physical health.
Trait versus state work engagement.
Generally, work engagement is conceptualized as a relatively stable phenomenon. This can be explained by the presence of specific job and organizational characteristics. However, engagement is not a fixed state: the level of engagement can even fluctuate on a weekly or day-to-day basis. Increasingly, attention is being paid to these short-term fluctuations by conducting experience sampling studies and diary studies.
Christian, Garza, and Slaughter (2011) meta-analyzed over 90 engagement research studies. They found that engagement is distinct from job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and job involvement.
Measurement.
The three aspects of work engagement (vigor, dedication and absorption) are assessed by the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES ), which is currently available in 20 languages and can be used freely for non-commercial purposes. In addition a short form and a student version are available. The reliability and validity of the UWES is documented is various studies (for an overview see ).
The Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) is an alternative instrument for the assessment of work engagement. It consists of two dimensions: exhaustion-vigor and cynicism-dedication.
Main drivers of work engagement.
Research has identified two key sets of variables that drive work engagement:
• Job resources: Work engagement is found to be positively associated with job resources such as social support from co-workers and from one’s superior, performance feedback, coaching, job control, task variety, opportunities for learning and development, and training facilities. These resources are helpful in reducing the impact of job demands on strain, but they are also useful in the achievement of work goals, and they stimulate learning, personal growth and development. One consistent finding is that the motivational potential of job resources is particularly salient in the face of high job demands.
--> Example: In a longitudinal study among 2555 Finnish dentists, researchers found that job resources lead to work engagement, which in turn had an influence on the level of personal initiative and consequently on work-unit innovativeness.
• Personal resources: personal resources, such as optimism, self-efficacy and resilience are functional in controlling the environment and exerting impact on it in a successful way. Furthermore, engaged employees have several personal characteristics that differentiate them from less engaged employees. Examples are extraversion, conscientiousness and emotional stability. Psychological capital also seems to be related to work engagement.
--> Example: Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti, and Schaufeli (2007) studied Dutch technicians’ work engagement in relation to three personal resources (self-efficacy, organizational-based self-esteem, and optimism). Results indicated that these resources were related to work engagement. 
For an overall model of work engagement, see Bakker & Demerouti (2008).
Engagement and performance.
Engagement is related to better performance. For instance, engaged contact workers from hotels and restaurants produce better service quality as perceived by their customers; the more engaged university students feel the higher their next year’s Grade Point Average; the higher the level of engagement of flight attendants, the better their in- and extra-role performance on the flight; and the more engaged restaurant workers, the higher the financial turnover of the shift.
Other research has shown links between supervisor-ratings of performance and the work engagement of teachers (Bakker and Bal, 2010 ) and administrative workers in financial services (Yalabik et al., 2013 ). Salanova, Agut and Peiró (2005) found a positive relationship between organization resources, work engagement and performance among employees, working in Spanish restaurants and hotels.
There are several possible reasons why engaged employees show higher performance than non-engaged employees:
1) They often experience positive emotions;
2) They experience better health;
3) They create their own job and personal resources;
4) They transfer their engagement to others (cross-over).
The downside of work engagement.
There is also a possibility of becoming ‘over-engaged’. For example, it can distort the work-life balance when employees take work home. Over-engagement may also lead to workaholism.

Triple Bend

Triple Bend (1968-1995) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who set a world record time of 119.80 for seven furlongs on dirt in winning the 1972 Los Angeles Handicap. [http://www.chef-de-race.com/articles/speed_in_the_thoroughbred.htm]

Nursed back to health, Triple Bend raced once as a juvenile in 1970.
Racing career.
Under trainer Vance Longden, in 1971 his best results races was a win in the Contra Costa Stakes plus four second-place finishes in other stakes races. A rapidly improving horse at age four, in 1972 Triple Bend ran second to Unconscious in the Strub Stakes then beat him in winning California's richest and most prestigious race, the Santa Anita Handicap. Triple Bend dead heated with Autobiography for first in the San Fernando Stakes and in winning the Los Angeles Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack, set a world record time of 119.80 for seven furlongs. In the late fall, Triple Bend won the Vosburgh Stakes at Aqueduct Race Track in the New York City borough of Queens.
Stud record.
Retired to stud duty, Triple Bend's progeny met with only modest racing success. He died on January 31, 1995 at the age of twenty-seven.
Honors.
In 1979, Hollywood Park Racetrack renamed the Lakes And Flowers Handicap in honor of Triple Bend. Since 2004, the Triple Bend Handicap has been a Grade 1 event.

Leekes

Leekes is a Welsh based retailer, with seven stores based in South Wales, South West England and The Midlands.
The company was established by James Henry Leeke in the Rhondda in 1897. He started trading as a traditional builder's merchant selling ironmongery and hardware from the front room of the family home in a small terraced house in Clydach Vale.
Since then Leekes has expanded with a Home Improvements Centre based in Tonypandy opening in the mid-1960s, and department stores opening in Talbot Green (1977), Cross Hands (1984), Melksham (1992), Bedworth (2010), Fenton (2010) Bilston (2011) and Coventry, West Midlands (2012) The company also owns the Vale Hotel Golf and Spa Resort, and Hensol Castle.
History.
James Henry Leeke established Leekes as a blacksmith in Tonypandy in the Rhondda Valley, Wales in 1897. James Leeke initially operated a smithy for sharpening tools at the rear of the house and then opened a small ironmongery business in the front room. 
The Leekes business survived the following two decades intact and James’ son Llewellyn took over the business from his father in 1933 at the age of 22. In 1948 Llewellyn bought a larger shop in Dunraven street, Tonypandy which is still trading today. At this time the ironmonger and builders merchant was operated almost entirely by the family. 
In the late 60s Llewellyn’s son Gerald joined the business full-time and extended the range at Dunraven street and established kitchen and bathrooms displays. They took over the shop next door for an additional showroom. In 1965 the company turnover had reached £38,000 and the old goods yard station in Trelaw, Rhondda was acquired for expansion, combining the retail premises and builders yard with some car parking. 
Leekes bought a site in Talbot Green and opened a store in 1977 labelled as its first “DIY superstore.”
In 2007 eldest son of Llewellyn, David Leeke wrote an account of the development of the Welsh business from the boom in the coal industry, through the Depression and two World Wars to the 21st century.
In 2009 Leekes bought out Midlands based Cole's Home Furnishing thus creating 3 new stores in England.
In 2011 Proposals have been made to have a new store built on the existing site in Talbot Green to coincide with the new town centre scheme which will be located on the current Leekes and Steadler factory sites. The development will also include a supermarket, hotel and cinema, as well as other facilities for residence. The Leekes store, if approved, would be one of the first builds to be completed.
In September 2012 Leekes introduced their new flagship store for the West Midnlands in Coventry, the store has a range of sections ranging from kitchens to bathrooms and an upstairs floor decitated to furniture and bedding. 
Present.
In 2008 Leekes remains a family business with many family members from the fourth generation. They currently have seven large department stores situated in Wales, the South West and the Midlands. Additionally they have a small double glazing outlets in Reading, Brent Knoll, Caerphilly, Hereford, Swindon and Thornbury. The store locations:
A new Flagship store in Coventry, West Midlands opened up in September 2012
Operations.
Each Leekes department store is divided into the following departments: 
Cabinet Furniture, Upholstery, Bedroom Furniture, Kitchen Furniture, Sound and Vision, Kitchen Appliances, Kitchen and Tableware, Home Accessories, Gifts, Fitted Bathrooms, Bathroom Accessories, Fitted Kitchens, Conservatories, Interior Design Studio, Fire Studio, Fitness Equipment & Leisure, DIY, Garden Living, Building Centre, Fitted Carpets, Decorating and Home Textiles.
Other businesses.
The Vale Resort.
In 1994, Leekes Retail and Leisure Group took ownership of a golf club in Hensol in the Vale of Glamorgan. This marked the start of diversification of the business into the leisure industry. 
The company then built and developed The Vale Resort which comprises a luxury four star hotel, state-of-the-art leisure club, Wales' largest spa and two championship golf courses set in over of beautiful parkland.
Hensol Castle.
In 2003, the company announced the purchase of the Hensol Castle estate that adjoins the Vale resort. The Estate includes a 17th-century stately home, an historically important mid-18th century landscaped park, a lake and serpentine pond. The castle is currently being developed into a world class spa hotel.

<doc id="20295168" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20295168" title="Naturalism (theatre)">
Naturalism (theatre)

Naturalism is a movement in European drama and theatre that developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It refers to theatre that attempts to create a perfect illusion of reality through a range of dramatic and theatrical strategies: detailed, three-dimensional settings (which bring Darwinian understandings of the determining role of the environment into the staging of human drama); everyday speech forms (prose over poetry); a secular world-view (no ghosts, spirits or gods intervening in the human action); an exclusive focus on subjects that are contemporary and indigenous (no exotic, otherworldly or fantastic locales, nor historical or mythic time-periods); an extension of the social range of characters portrayed (away from the aristocrats of classical drama, towards bourgeois and eventually working-class protagonists); and a style of acting that attempts to recreate the impression of reality (often by seeking complete identification with the role, understood in terms of its 'given circumstances', which, again, transcribe Darwinian motifs into performance, as advocated by Stanislavski). Naturalistic role play is used within theatrical performances to demonstrate to the audience or show the audience how this would appear in real life. No still images are used as this does not show the full quality of the piece of drama. 
Naturalism was first advocated explicitly by Émile Zola in his 1880 essay entitled "Naturalism on the Stage".
Influences.
Naturalistic writers were influenced by the theory of evolution of Charles Darwin. They believed that one's heredity and social environment determine one's character. Whereas realism seeks only to describe subjects as they really are, naturalism also attempts to determine "scientifically" the underlying forces (i.e. the environment or heredity) influencing the actions of its subjects. Naturalistic works are opposed to romanticism, in which subjects may receive highly symbolic, idealistic, or even supernatural treatment. They often include uncouth or sordid subject matter; for example, Émile Zola's works had a frankness about sexuality along with a pervasive pessimism. Naturalistic works exposed the dark harshness of life, including poverty, racism, sex, prejudice, disease, prostitution, and filth. As a result, Naturalistic writers were frequently criticized for being too blunt.
The critique of Naturalism.
Naturalism was criticized in the twentieth century by a whole host of theatre practitioners; Constantin Stanislavski, for example, argued for a puncturing of the illusion of the surface of reality in order to reach the real forces that determine it beneath its appearance; in place of the absorption within a fiction that Naturalistic performance promotes in its audience, he attempted to inculcate a more detached consideration of the realities and the issues behind them that the play confronts. His approach is a development, however, of the critical project initiated by Naturalism; it is a form of modernist realism.
Naturalistic performance is often unsuitable for the performance of other types of theatre—particularly older forms, but also many twentieth-century non-Naturalistic plays. Shakespearean verse, for example, demands a rigorous attention to its rhythmic sub-structure and often long and complex phrasings; naturalistic actors tend to cut these down to the far shorter speech patterns of modern drama, destroying the rhythmic support that assists the audience's process of comprehension. In addition, Shakespearean drama assumed a natural, direct and often-renewed "contact" with the audience on the part of the performer; 'fourth wall' performances foreclose these complex layerings of theatrical and dramatic realities the game that are built into Shakespeare's dramaturgy. A good example is the line spoken by Cleopatra in "Antony and Cleopatra"'s act five, when she contemplates her humiliation in Rome at the hands of Octavius Caesar, by means of mocking theatrical renditions of her fate: "And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore"; that this was to be spoken by a boy in a dress in a theatre is an integral part of its dramatic meaning—a complexity unavailable to a purely naturalistic treatment.

Gyrovector space

A gyrovector space is a mathematical concept proposed by Abraham A. Ungar for studying hyperbolic geometry in analogy to the way vector spaces are used in Euclidean geometry. Ungar introduced the concept of gyrovectors that have addition based on gyrogroups instead of vectors which have addition based on groups. Ungar developed his concept as a tool for the formulation of special relativity as an alternative to the use of Lorentz transformations to represent compositions of velocities (also called boosts - "boosts" are aspects of relative velocities, and should not be conflated with "translations"). This is achieved by introducing "gyro operators"; two 3d velocity vectors are used to construct an operator, which acts on another 3d velocity.
Lorentz transformations form a group (see Lorentz group and Poincaré group), are simpler mathematically, and consequently are generally preferred in relativistic physics.
Introduction.
A gyrovector space is a mathematical concept proposed by Abraham A. Ungar for studying hyperbolic geometry in analogy to the way vector spaces are used in Euclidean geometry. Ungar introduced the concept of gyrovectors that have addition based on gyrogroups instead of vectors which have addition based on groups.
Name.
Gyrogroups are weakly-associative-grouplike-structure. Ungar proposed the term gyrogroup was for what he called a gyrocommutative-gyrogroup with the term gyrogroup being reserved for the non-gyrocommutative case in analogy with groups vs commutative-groups. Gyrogroups are a type of Bol loop. Gyrocommutative gyrogroups are equivalent to "K-loops" although defined differently. The terms "Bruck loop" and "dyadic symset" are also in use.
Mathematics of gyrovector spaces.
Gyrogroups.
Axioms.
A groupoid ("G", formula_1) is a gyrogroup if its binary operation satisfies the following axioms:
The first pair of axioms are like the group axioms. The last pair present the gyrator axioms and the middle axiom links the two pairs.
Since a gyrogroup has inverses and an identity it qualifies as a quasigroup and a loop.
Gyrogroups are a generalization of groups. Every group is an example of a gyrogroup with gyr defined as the identity map.
An example of a finite gyrogroup is given in.
Identities.
Some identities which hold in any gyrogroup (G,formula_1):
More identities given on page 50 of.
Gyrocommutativity.
A gyrogroup (G,formula_1) is gyrocommutative if its binary operation obeys the gyrocommutative law: a formula_1 b = gyrb(b formula_1 a). For relativistic velocity addition, this formula showing the role of rotation relating a+b and b+a was published in 1914 by Ludwik Silberstein
Coaddition.
In every gyrogroup, a second operation can be defined called "coaddition": aformula_21 b = aformula_1 gyr[a,formula_3b]b for all a, b  ∈  G. Coaddition is commutative if the gyrogroup addition is gyrocommutative.
Beltrami–Klein disc/ball model and Einstein addition.
Relativistic velocities can be considered as points in the Beltrami–Klein model of hyperbolic geometry and so vector addition in the Beltrami–Klein model can be given by the velocity addition formula. In order for the formula to generalize to vector addition in hyperbolic space of dimensions greater than 3, the formula must be written in a form that avoids use of the cross product in favour of the dot product.
In the general case, the Einstein velocity addition of two velocities formula_24 and formula_25 is given in coordinate-independent form as:
where formula_27 is the gamma factor given by the equation formula_28 and formula_29 is given by the equations:
formula_30
formula_31
This is related to the connection between Möbius transformations and Lorentz transformations.
Gyrotrigonometry.
Gyrotrigonometry is the use of gyroconcepts to study hyperbolic triangles.
Hyperbolic trigonometry as usually studied uses the hyperbolic functions cosh, sinh etc., and this contrasts with spherical trigonometry which uses the Euclidean trigonometric functions cos, sin, but with spherical triangle identities instead of ordinary plane triangle identities. Gyrotrigonometry takes the approach of using the ordinary trigonometric functions but in conjunction with gyrotriangle identities.
Triangle centers.
The study of triangle centers traditionally is concerned with Euclidean geometry, but triangle centers can also be studied in hyperbolic geometry. Using gyrotrigonometry, expressions for trigonometric barycentric coordinates can be calculated that have the same form for both euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. In order for the expressions to coincide, the expressions must "not" encapsulate the specification of the anglesum being 180 degrees.
Gyroparallelogram addition.
Using gyrotrigonometry, a gyrovector addition can be found which operates according to the gyroparallelogram law. This is the coaddition to the gyrogroup operation. Gyroparallelogram addition is commutative.
The gyroparallelogram law is similar to the parallelogram law in that a gyroparallelogram is a hyperbolic quadrilateral the two gyrodiagonals of which intersect at their gyromidpoints, just as a parallelogram is a Euclidean quadrilateral the two diagonals of which intersect at their midpoints.
Bloch vectors.
Bloch vectors which belong to the open unit ball of the Euclidean 3-space, can be studied with Einstein addition or Möbius addition.
Book reviews.
A review of one of the earlier gyrovector books says the following:
"Over the years, there have been a handful of attempts to promote the non-Euclidean style for use in problem solving in relativity and electrodynamics, the failure of which to attract any substantial following, compounded by the absence of any positive results must give pause to anyone considering a similar undertaking. Until recently, no one was in a position to offer an improvement on the tools available since 1912. In his new book, Ungar furnishes the crucial missing element from the panoply of the non-Euclidean style: an elegant nonassociative algebraic formalism that fully exploits the structure of Einstein’s law of velocity composition."

<doc id="20295296" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20295296" title="Pulpotomy">
Pulpotomy

A pulpotomy is the removal of a portion of the pulp, including the diseased aspect, with the intent of maintaining the vitality of the remaining pulpal tissue by means of a therapeutic dressing. A healthy tooth has a space inside it called the "pulp space" which is filled with soft tissues - nerves, blood vessels and pink connective tissue. If a tooth gets a large cavity, the bacteria in the decay can damage the pulp, which is often what causes toothache.
Damage to the pulp of permanent teeth usually requires a Root Canal Treatment or Endodontic Therapy. The pulp of primary or deciduous teeth, which only have to survive until an adult teeth come in, and because they have a better blood supply, can sometimes be saved.
Indications.
Primary teeth.
Primary (Baby) teeth in children have relatively large pulp spaces and a cavity does not have to get very large before it reaches the pulp chamber.
When the soft tissue in the pulp chamber is "infected" (has bacteria in it) or "affected" (is inflamed), it can be removed by a dentist under local anaesthetic. If the soft tissue in the canals is still healthy enough, a special medicated filling can be put into the chamber in an attempt to keep the remaining pulp (in the canals) alive. The process of removing the pulp from the chamber is the actual "pulpotomy", though the word is often used for the entire process including placement of the medication.
Afterwards the tooth is restored with a regular filling or a stainless steel crown.
A pulpotomy can be done to both permanent and temporary teeth.
Types.
Partial Pulpotomy for Carious Exposures.
In some cases an adult tooth might have decay down to the pulp but the pulp is still pretty healthy. If the roots haven't finished forming yet, a partial pulpotomy might give it a chance to finish forming.
Partial Pulpotomy for Traumatic Exposures.
A partial pulpotomy for traumatic exposures is also called a Cvek Pulpotomy. When a baby tooth or young permanent tooth is traumatised - say, hitting your teeth on the handlebars of a bike - it can be broken in such a way that the pulp is exposed. Again, a partial pulpotomy may help it to finish developing and be saved.
Medicaments.
In primary teeth medicaments such as formocresol, Mineral trioxide aggregate, Zinc oxide eugenol and Calcium hydroxide can be used in pulpotomy. Formocresol use has been questioned due to toxicity concerns.
Ferric sulphate or a local anaesthetic solution containing a vasoconstrictor agent can be used to arrest any bleeding from the pulp prior to the placement of medicament.
Alternative pulpotomy techniques.
Electro-surgery pulpotomy.
It is known as non chemical devitalization. Its mechanism of action is the cauterization of the pulp tissue. It carburizes heat denaturated pulp and bacterial contamination.
Laser pulpotomy.
This technique overcomes histological effect of electro surgery. It creates superficial zone of coagulation necrosis that remain compatible with underlying tissue& isolate pulp from vigorous effects of the sub-base.
Objectives.
1. Maintenance of radicular portion vitality.
2. Clinical and radiographic evaluation should show no complications such as, pain, swelling, internal resorption or abnormal canal calcification.
3. Neither breakdown of the supporting tissue, nor trauma to succedaneous teeth should be detected.

The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), is a United States federal law, enacted on September 7, 1916. Sponsored by Sen. John W. Kern (D) of Indiana and Rep. Daniel J. McGillicuddy (D) of Maine, it established compensation to federal civil service employees for wages lost due to job-related injuries. This act became the precedent for "disability insurance" across the country and the precursor to broad-coverage health insurance.
President Woodrow Wilson signed H.R. 15316 into law on September 7, 1916.
The Federal Employees' Compensation Commission was the original administrator of the FECA. However, the Commission did not exist at the time the FECA went into effect and claims accumulated for more than six months while members were selected and sworn into office. The Federal Employees' Compensation Commission officially began its duties on March 14, 1917. The Commission was abolished on May 16, 1946 by President Harry S. Truman as part of the Reorganization Act of 1939. Its duties were transferred to the Federal Security Agency on July 16, 1946.

Denshaw

Denshaw is a village in Saddleworth—a civil parish of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies by the source of the River Tame, high amongst the Pennines above the village of Delph, northeast of Oldham, and north-northwest of Uppermill. It has a population of around 500.
Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Denshaw and its surroundings have provided archaeological evidence of Stone and Bronze Age activity in the area. The name Denshaw is of Old Norse derivation, and the oldest part of the village is an ancient hamlet.
Built up around the junction of five major roads, until the 20th century, Denshaw consisted mainly of smallholdings and a few public houses such as the Junction Inn, originally built as a coaching house for travellers. Denshaw is noted for its annual Whit Friday brass band contest.
History.
There is evidence of Stone Age activity around Denshaw; in 2004 Saddleworth Archaeological Trust objected to the construction of a wind farm on a site on Denshaw Moor which had produced more than 200 Mesolithic artefacts. Human activity in Denshaw continued in the Bronze Age, as demonstrated by the discovery of a palstave on Wall Green in 1932, when a trench was being dug for a water pipe, and some tools from Denshaw Moor, on the site of the proposed wind farm, which include a ceremonial flint dagger. A Roman road may also cross the site.
The name Denshaw is derived from Old Norse, suggesting a settlement may have existed there during the period of the Danelaw. Denshaw Fold, the oldest part of the village, is an isolated hamlet of ancient origin. Many of the traditional stone dwellings are listed buildings and are descendants of the cluster of houses first built in the locality during the 16th century. Around 1795, the Junction Inn at Denshaw was erected. It served as a posting house on the Ripponden-to-Oldham turnpike road (opened in 1798) for the changing of horses and the provision of refreshments.
Denshaw did not experience the same rate of urbanisation and industrialisation as its surrounding settlements during the Industrial Revolution, and it did not become a mill town or a centre of the local cotton mill boom as did nearby Rochdale, Milnrow and Oldham. However, Denshaw Vale was a calico printing factory which was "an important concern that employed a workforce of 150" during the 19th century. Furthermore, Denshaw was chosen as the site of a reservoir which local mills were to contribute monies and thereby use; In 1828, Rackenden Deign Reservoir was built by Denshaw to provide for 24 watermills. In 1818 an Oddfellows Lodge was erected in the village. In 1887, Denshaw was documented having a population of 1,279.
In 2003, energy company E.ON UK proposed the installation of seven wind turbines at Denshaw. This was met with opposition from the local and wider communities, culminating in the Saddleworth Moors Action Group, who were joined by environmentalist David Bellamy. The council received over 1,000 letters objecting to the proposed wind farm, and although initially accepted by the former Liberal Democrat local authority, the application was rejected by Labour-controlled Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council on 1 March 2006.
On 23 May 2007, Denshaw's post office (which doubled-up as the village's only shop) was the centre of a robbery. The "tiny premises" had been under threat of closure owing to Post Office's modernisation plans and has now closed.
On 17 April 2008, local, national and international media reported on Denshaw's entry on Wikipedia which had been vandalised with spoof information. The entry "attracted unwelcome notoriety after it was targeted" by editors, although the offending material was removed after initial reports were published. The story featured on the BBC's "North West Tonight", a regional news programme, and later picked up by news services as far away as Pakistan.
Governance.
Lying within the ancient county boundaries of Yorkshire since a very early time, during the Middle Ages, Denshaw lay within the Saddleworth chapelry of the ancient parish of Rochdale. Like the other Yorkshire areas of the ancient parish, it was in the wapentake of Agbrigg in Yorkshire, with the Lancashire areas of the ancient parish being in Salfordshire.
The Byrons (including Romantic poet George Gordon Byron) were prominent land owners in Denshaw. Denshaw was created an ecclesiastical parish in 1864, out of the former Friarmere parochial chapelry. It was in the deanery of Ashton-under-Lyne from 1864 to 1872. It then became part of Rochdale deanery until 1881 when it again became part of Ashton-under-Lyne. In 1929, it transferred to Oldham deanery. It is currently in Saddleworth Deanery, part of the Archdeanery of Rochdale, in the Anglican Diocese of Manchester.
From 1894 to 1900, Denshaw lay within Saddleworth Rural District, a local government district in the administrative County of York, West Riding. In 1900, Denshaw was merged into Saddleworth Urban District, where it stayed until 1974. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Saddleworth Urban District was abolished, and Denshaw has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, within Greater Manchester. Denshaw lies within the Saddleworth North electoral ward.
Since 1997, Denshaw has formed part of the parliamentary constituency of Oldham East and Saddleworth, and is represented in the House of Commons by Debbie Abrahams, a member of the Labour Party. Between 1983 and 1997 it was in the Littleborough and Saddleworth constituency.
Geography.
At (53.5921°, -2.0385°) and north-northwest of London, Denshaw stands about above sea level, northeast of Manchester City Centre, on elevated Pennine ground by the River Tame, which flows southwesterly from its source near the Dowry and New Years Bridge reservoirs. The land-use of Denshaw, which centres on a road junction, is predominantly residential, the outlying land being a mixture of permanent grassland and heath.
Denshaw lies amongst the South Pennines, and is topographically characterised by hilly, upland terrain. Denshaw is not contiguous with any other settlement and for purposes of the Office for National Statistics, does not form part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area.
Denshaw experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year.
There are a number of small named-localities in and around Denshaw, including Denshaw Fold, Cherry Clough, Junction, Old Tame, Slackcote, Grains Bar and Woodbrow.
Landmarks.
Christ Church is Denshaw's parish church. It is part of the Church of England and lies within the Anglican Diocese of Manchester. A Grade II listed building since 19 June 1967, Christ Church dates from 1863, the year before Denshaw became an ecclesiastical parish. It was built by Henry Gartside, a resident of Denshaw.
Denshaw War Memorial lies within the churchyard. It was erected by public subscription "in honour of the men who fell and served" in the First and Second World Wars. The monument has Rolls of Honour containing the 32 names of those from Denshaw who fought and died in these wars.
Transport.
Denshaw lies south of the M62 motorway, at a road junction where the A640, A672 and A6052 roads intersect. There are no rail services in Denshaw. Following closure of the Oldham Loop Line, the nearest railway station to Denshaw is located at Greenfield.
Two bus routes serve Denshaw. One is the daily 407 service between Denshaw and Oldham via Pennine Meadows and Moorside run by Stotts and operating hourly during the daytime. The other is the 354, running from Denshaw to Ashton-under-Lyne via Delph, Uppermill, Mossley and Stalybridge. It is operated by First Greater Manchester and runs every two hours Monday–Saturday daytime. There are no evening journeys on either service, they are replaced by a Local Link demand responsive transport service instead. In its guise as the 562 route, it carried on to Halifax in West Yorkshire. This was withdrawn in April 2006. At one point, the first and last journeys of the 354 were extended to Rochdale, when the service was worked by Bu-Val Buses earlier on in the 21st century.
Culture and community.
Denshaw is noted for its annual brass band contest, held on every Whit Friday. The Denshaw Whit Friday Band Contest was established in 1993 and in its first year attracted 25 bands.
Denshaw has a primary school named Christ Church Primary. It is a denominational school with the Church of England, linked with Denshaw's parish church.
Denshaw village hall is the home of an amateur dramatic group and hosts various village activities; the hall was awarded a grant of £10,000 by the Awards for All scheme, a small grants scheme run by the National Lottery.
Denshaw is referred to in Barclay James Harvest's 1993 song "Ballad Of Denshaw Mill".
Public services.
Home Office policing in Denshaw is provided by the Greater Manchester Police. The force's "(Q) Division" have their headquarters for policing the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham at central Oldham; Denshaw's nearest police station is at Uppermill. Public transport is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service.
There are no hospitals in Denshaw, the nearest being the Royal Oldham Hospital, in neighbouring Oldham. Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust is the local NHS Trust. The North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport to and from Denshaw. Other forms of health care are provided for locally by several small clinics and surgeries in and around Saddleworth.
Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority. Locally produced inert waste for disposal is sent to landfill at the Beal Valley. Denshaw's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is United Utilities. United Utilities also manages Denshaw's drinking and waste water; water supplies being sourced from several local reservoirs, including Dovestones and Chew.

Chamberlain–Ferris Act

The Chamberlain–Ferris Act (39 Stat. 218) of June 9, 1916 was an Act of the United States Congress that ruled that of the original granted to the Southern Pacific Company (successor to the Oregon and California Railroad) in California and Oregon were revested to the United States, and put under the control of the General Land Office, which was to dispose of the lands and timber through auction sales. The lands were named the Oregon and California Railroad Revested Lands (better known as the "O&C Lands").
The bill was sponsored by Senator George E. Chamberlain of Oregon and Representative Scott Ferris of Oklahoma, both Democrats.
The results proved disappointing, and the act was repealed by the subsequent Oregon and California Revested Lands Sustained Yield Management Act of 1937 () of August 28, 1937, which authorized the Secretary of the Interior to establish sustained yield units on the land, of which was still unsold. This act established the O&C administration to manage the lands.
As of 2006, of the revested lands are managed by the Bureau of Land Management and are managed by the United States Forest Service.

Under the Red Robe (novel)

Under the Red Robe is an 1894 historical novel by Stanley J. Weyman, described as his best known book and greatest success. It is set in seventeenth-century France during the ascendency of Cardinal Richelieu, who appears as a character in the novel. In particular it portrays the events of the Day of the Dupes.
The novel was adapted into a 1923 American silent film "Under the Red Robe" directed by Alan Crosland, and was later made into a 1937 British swashbuckler film, "Under the Red Robe", directed by Victor Sjöström.
The novel was well received by contemporary historical novelists. Conan Doyle wrote that "Under the Red Robe" had "the most dramatic opening of any historical novel I know", and Robert Louis Stevenson commented favourably both on the first chapter and on the surprise which the author keeps to the very end. Siegfried Sassoon in his autobiography described his excitement as a schoolboy on first reading a copy. Half a century after its publication, Roger Lancelyn Green characterized the novel as having no dull moment.

Spread over three floors, the shop sells men's and women's fashions on the ground floor and carpets, beds, furniture, soft furnishings and blinds on the first floor.
The business was started in 1882 by Christopher Milner, hence the C in the name, with a shop in Hawes, and is now in its fifth generation in the family following the retirement of David Milner in March 2008.
The BBC made a television documentary series of three programmes, entitled 'The Department Store'. Produced by Richard Macer, it was about independent department stores and how they are surviving in the modern world in the face of stiff competition from chain stores. The first programme in the series, on Milners, was filmed by the BBC from September 2007 to April 2008. It was initially shown on BBC Four on 17 November 2008 and subsequently on BBC Two on 7 April 2009.
David Milner, who was featured in the programme, has retired and even assisted with a charity expedition to the Gambia in January 2010 His daughter, Leonie, with her husband, Keith Garrard, are now in charge of the store.

<doc id="20295637" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20295637" title="PUC19">
PUC19

pUC19 is one of a series of plasmid cloning vectors created by Messing and co-workers. The designation "pUC" is derived from the classical "p" prefix (denoting "plasmid") and the abbreviation for the University of California, where early work on the plasmid series had been conducted. It is a circular double stranded DNA and has 2686 base pairs. pUC19 is one of the most widely used vector molecules as the recombinants, or the cells into which foreign DNA has been introduced, can be easily distinguished from the non-recombinants based on colour differences of colonies on growth media. pUC18 is similar to pUC19, but the MCS region is reversed.
Components.
It has one "ampR" gene (ampicillin resistance gene), and an N-terminal fragment of β-galactosidase ("lac Z") gene of "E. coli". The multiple cloning site (MCS) region is split into the "lac Z" gene (codons 6–7 of "lac Z" are replaced by MCS), where various restriction sites for many restriction endonucleases are present.
The "ori" site or replicon, "rep" is derived from pMB1 vector. pUC vector is small but has a high copy number. The high copy number of pUC plasmids is a result of the lack of the "rop" gene and a single point mutation in rep of pMB1. The "lac Z" gene codes for α-galactosidase. The recognition sites for HindIII, SphI, PstI, SalI, XbaI, BamHI, SmaI, KpnI, SacI and EcoRI restriction enzymes have been derived from the vector M13mp19.
Function.
This plasmid is introduced into a bacterial cell by a process called "transformation", where it can multiply and express itself. However due to the presence of MCS and several restriction sites, a foreign piece of DNA of choice can be introduced into it by inserting it into place in MCS region. The cells which have taken up the plasmid can be differentiated from cells which have not taken up the plasmid by growing it on media with Ampicillin. Only the cells with the plasmid containing the ampicillin resistance ("ampR") gene will survive. Furthermore, the transformed cells containing the plasmid with the gene of our interest can be distinguished from cells with the plasmid but without the gene of interest, just by looking at the colour of the colony they make on agar media supplemented with IPTG and X-gal. Recombinants are white, whereas non-recombinants are blue in colour. This is the most notable feature of pUC19.
Mechanism.
The "lac Z" fragment, whose synthesis can be induced by IPTG, is capable of intra-allelic complementation with a defective form of β-galactosidase enzyme encoded by host chromosome (mutation lacZDM15). In the presence of IPTG in growth medium, bacteria synthesise both fragments of the enzyme. Both the fragments can together hydrolyse X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- beta-D-galactopyranoside) and form blue colonies on media with X-gal.
Insertion of foreign DNA into the MCS located within the "lac Z" gene causes insertional inactivation of this gene at the N-terminal fragment of beta-galactosidase and abolishes intra-allelic complementation. Thus bacteria carrying recombinant plasmids in the MCS cannot hydrolyse X-gal, giving rise to white colonies, which can be distinguished on culture media from non-recombinant cells, which are blue.
Therefore the media used should contain ampicillin, IPTG, and X-gal.

Sendlinger Tor

The Sendlinger Tor (from German: Sendling Gate) is a city gate at the southern extremity of the historic old town area of Munich. It served as a fortification for the defence and is one of Munich's three remaining gothic town gates ("Sendlinger Tor", "Isartor", and "Karlstor").
Location.
The Sendlinger Tor (located at Sendlinger Str 49) lies at the southern end of Sendlingerstrasse, the north-south highway through Munich's old town. Thus separates the Sendlinger Tor of the old city from the Isar suburb. The Sendlinger Tor is at an altitude of above sea level.
History.
As part of the great urban expansion by Ludwig the Bavarian (from 1285 to 1337), a second city wall with four town gates was built, of which Sendlinger Tor was one. In 1318, Sendlinger Tor was first mentioned as a starting point for the road to Italy, but was probably existing earlier. Originally there was only the distinctive central tower gate (typical of the Munich city gates of the time). In 1420 that was supplemented by the two flanking towers, which were required to properly terminate the end of the outer city wall.
In 1808 the central tower was demolished. In 1860 a restoration of the two remaining Medieval flanking towers and the wall with three arches. In 1906, these original three arches were replaced by the one large single arch.
In the Second World War, the gate was barely damaged. It was refurbished in the 1980s. On the Sendlinger Tor, a remnant of the old city wall can still be seen, which previously went up the Herzog-Wilhelm-Str.
Public Transportation.
It gives its name to the Sendlinger Tor U-Bahn station.

Cross-community vote

A cross-community vote or cross-community support is a form of voting used in the Northern Ireland Assembly according to the provisions of the 1998 Belfast Agreement. It requires the support of both main communities in Northern Ireland, in other words majority of unionists and the majority of nationalist members of the Assembly. It is also used to a lesser extent at local government level.
Background.
Upon taking their seats members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are required to designate themselves as either "unionist", "nationalist" or "other". MLAs are free to designate themselves as they see fit, the only requirement being that no member may change his or her designation more than once during an Assembly session.
A vote will not automatically require cross-community support. A "Petition of Concern" must first be presented to the Speaker by at least 30 of the 108 members. In a cross-community vote the majority of unionists and the majority of nationalist votes are required to pass a motion put to the Assembly.

Württemberg Ts 4

The DRG Class 99.17, formerly the Württemberg Ts 4 of the Royal Württemberg State Railways were German narrow gauge steam locomotives bought for working the 15.11 kilometre long route between the towns of Altensteig and Nagold. The three tank locomotives had an outer frame and a "Klose" drive. The first and third axles were steered by the third, radially-sliding axle by means of a system of levers. The second axle was driven by the inside cylinder and had no wheel flanges. Overall the system was very reliable, but nevertheless also very maintenance-intensive.
The engines were delivered in 1891, 1892 and 1899, and later all taken over by the Reichsbahn. There they were given numbers 99 171–99 173. They also had the names "Altensteig, Berneck" and "Ebhausen"

Mar Y Cel

Mar Y Cel or, more correctly, Mar i Cel (Catalan: "Sea and Sky") is an open space preserve conserved by the Land Trust for Santa Barbara County, in Santa Barbara County, California, USA. Located in the Santa Ynez Mountains foothills above Montecito, Mar Y Cel is a estate. It includes the notable "Tea Gardens", as well as the West Fork of Cold Springs Trail, a well used hiking trail.
Early history.
Henry E. Bothin (pronounced, "bo-THEEN") (d. 1923), of Ohio, came to San Francisco where he built an empire, starting with a spice and coffee factory in 1875, and then gaining large commercial real estate holdings. He was president of Judson Manufacturing Company. Around 1916, Bothin and his second wife, the heiress Ellen "Nellie" Chabot Bothin (1865-1965), added the Mar Y Cel property, commonly referred to as the "Tea Gardens", to their Montecito estate home, Piranhurst, which was nearing completion. Ellen's deceased father, Antoine "Anthony" Chabot, had been notable for his Bay Area water systems, and had been a colleague of Bothin's. Upon Mar Y Cel, the Bothins built stone aqueducts, water works, arches, and statues. The water projects included scalloped bowls that rested on columns, allowing water to spill from one into the other. After completion, 35 gardeners maintained the area. Other construction included a 200-seat amphitheater, as well as the "Tea House", built as an open-air piazza, surrounded by four walls. In 1918, Ellen was honored with a gladiolus named in her behalf, the "Mrs. H. E. Bothin".
Following the June 29, 1925, magnitude 6.3, Santa Barbara earthquake, three of the Tea House walls were damaged. Subsequently, atmospheric painter and landscape designer Lockwood de Forest, Jr. (1850-1932), added red brick garden planters to the property, while the water garden system was remodeled, costing one million dollars.
After Ellen's death, Edward F. Brown purchased a portion of Piranhurst from the family heirs, that lead to the "Tea Gardens" property becoming a separate parcel which the Bothin family sold to Mr. Shirley Carter Burden (1908-1989), fine arts photographer, writer, and great-great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Burden later resold it to the current owners.
Later history.
In September 2000, Cima del Mundo LLC, an environmental investment group, offered to donate a conservation easement on a portion of Mar Y Cel: the northern . This eliminated the possibility of future residential development while ensuring the protection of both wildlife habitat and the property's scenic beauty. In addition, the company granted a easement to the Land Trust ensuring that a portion of the Cold Spring Trail is open for public use.
On November 13, 2008, the Montecito Tea Fire ignited the historic "Tea House" structure, above Mountain Drive. Over the course of several days, the fire spread and burned , destroyed over 200 homes, and injured 13 people.

Ellen Parsons

Ellen Parsons is a fictional character on the American legal thriller series "Damages". The character was created by the writer trio of Glenn Kessler, Todd A. Kessler, and Daniel Zelman. 
Ellen's transformation from ambitious, idealistic and somewhat naïve law school graduate to a sophisticated, ruthless attorney is one of the main themes of the show. The mentor-protegee relationship between her and Patty Hewes shapes and advances the character throughout the show. After working for Patty, being an informant for the FBI, and joining the public attorney's office, she finally opens her own law firm and builds a name for herself.
In the series finale, Ellen gives up being a lawyer after learning that she is pregnant and becomes a happy wife and mother. Patty enters a shop where Ellen and her daughter are happily looking at goodies. Ellen sees Patty but ignores her. We see Ellen and her child leaving the store and talking about going to see "daddy" who we assume is Chris. Back in her car, Patty fantasizes that Ellen approaches the car and through the window thanks her for all she's done for her. Patty pulls herself back to reality and is last seen contemplating her life...successful, yet entirely alone. 
The character was widely praised, as well as Byrne's portrayal. Byrne was nominated twice for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2009 and 2010, and twice for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film in 2008 and 2010.

John Daniel Thompson McAllister (February 19, 1827 – January 21, 1910) was a 19th-century regional leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He is possibly most notable for having written the "Hand Cart Song".
Biography.
McAllister was born in Lewis, Sussex County, Delaware. In 1844 he moved to Philadelphia. 
McAllister was baptized a member of the LDS Church in 1847. He married Ellen Handley in 1848. They then moved to St. Louis, Missouri where he worked as a blacksmith. In 1850, he moved to Council Bluffs, Iowa where he worked as a store clerk and then moved to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory in 1851.
In Salt Lake City, McAllister helped build the Old Tabernacle and was a member of Ballo's brass band. He left on a mission to England and surrounding countries in early 1853. In 1855, McAllister was serving as an LDS Church missionary in Belfast. He returned to the United States in 1856, and helped organize the handcart companies at Iowa City.
After returning to Utah Territory with a handcart company, McAllister was appointed a major in the Nauvoo Legion. He also was a member of the Deseret Dramatic Association. He then served another mission, both in the United States and Europe from 1860 to 1862. McAllister's first stop on this mission was in his place of baptism, Philadelphia, where he was able to convince many of the Latter Day Saints it was time to move to the west. He also baptized the family of his brother, Richard Wesley McAllister. He was the head of a pioneer company in 1862. In 1861 he made a journey to Utah Territory with his mother. He made a final return to Utah Territory in 1862.
After his return to Utah, McAllister served as Salt Lake City and later Utah Territorial Marshall and as superintendent of Brigham Young's woolen mills. In 1877 McAllister was appointed president of the LDS Church's St. George Stake. He also served as the Brigadier General for the Utah militia in Washington County, Utah. 
McAllister was first counselor to Wilford Woodruff in the presidency of the St. George Temple when it opened. During this time he baptized Wilford Woodruff as proxy for the founding fathers of the United States. He also worked closely with Woodruff in beginning the performance of endowments on behalf of the dead.
McAllister served as president of the St. George Temple from 1884 to 1893 and then as president of the Manti Temple from 1893 to 1906. 
In 1889 McAllister surrendered to U.S. Marshals who had been seeking him for several years on charges of recognizing and publicly acknowledging his plural wives. His lawyer in the succeeding trial was James H. Moyle.
The subsequent Grand Jury trial held September 1889, returned a verdict of not guilty.

Ballaragh Halt

Ballaragh Halt (sometimes Bulgham) is an intermediate stopping place on the northerly section of the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man
Location.
It is the nearest stopping place to the line's summit. The halt is little used today but following a large landslip that severed the line in 1967 it acted as the railway's temporary terminus. Passengers would disembark their tramcar, walk onto the road and re-board a northerly based car to continue their journey. The halt serves the small hamlet of the same name, and is sometimes referred to as "Bulgham Bay" in literature.
Platforms.
The site of the halt is discernable from the main road that runs parallel as it features a set of steps for passengers built into the stone wall that separates the two. During July 2009 at a point a little further north of the station, a viewing platform consisting of planking and railings was erected here to demarkate the passenger-accessible land for special tram services that operate in the area.
Dedication.
Further north still is the summit of the line, at which point a plaque has been erected to the memory of Mike Goodwyn, historian and chairman of the Manx Electric Railway Society and this is visible from the passing tramcars.

Conus californicus

Conus californicus, also known as "Californiconus californicus", common name the California cone, is a species of small, predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails. As both the Latin name and common name suggest, this cone is found primarily in California.
Distribution and habitat.
This small cone snail is unusual because most species in the family are tropical, whereas this species lives in the cooler waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean, including most of the coast of California. The range of this species is from the Farallon Islands near San Francisco to Bahia Magdalena, in Baja California, Mexico. [http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/Inverts/Mollusca/Gastropoda/Orthogastropoda/Caenogastropoda/Neogastropoda/Conus_californicus/Conus_californicus.html]
This cone is found in both rocky and sandy areas, in the intertidal zone and subtidally down to 30 meters depth. [http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/Inverts/Mollusca/Gastropoda/Orthogastropoda/Caenogastropoda/Neogastropoda/Conus_californicus/Conus_californicus.html]
Feeding habits.
The California cone hunts and eats marine worms, fish and mollusks, and is also a scavenger.
Fossil record.
Fossils of "Conus californicus" have been recovered from the Late Pleistocene strata of Isla Vista, California.

Dhoon Glen Halt

Dhoon Glen is an intermediate stopping place on the northerly section of the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man
Location.
The stop lies at the top of the steep glen leading to a secluded pebble beach. The station is built on a bend in the formation of both the road and railway, and boasts its own tiny cafe which has been there for many years, latterly known as "Jean's Place" among other titles, it is currently called the "Dhoon Coffee Stop".
Dhoon Glen Hotel.
There is a large unsurfaced car park adjacent to the station which marks the site of the Dhoon Glen Hotel which was destroyed by fire in 1917 and never rebuilt. The old station shelter, separate from the cafe (which houses passenger toilet facilities beneath it) was replaced in 1987 with a more modern structure, and now forms a passenger shelter in addition to being covered accommodation for the cafe as required.

Brownlee (born 1965) is a former United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia and current Chair of the National White Collar Defense and Investigations practice at the international law firm of Holland & Knight, LLP in Washington, DC. On July 17, 2013, it was announced that Brownlee had been retained to represent Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell with regard to a federal Grand Jury investigation.
Early Years and education.
John Brownlee was born in Casper, Wyoming on January 31, 1965. His father, Les Brownlee, was an infantry officer assigned to the 101st Airborne Division. Brownlee’s father began the first of two tours in Vietnam when John was only 6 months old. His mother, Nancy Jane Long Brownlee, was an elementary school teacher who later worked with the Fairfax County, Virginia Head Start program.

In 1994, Brownlee graduated from the William & Mary School of Law in Williamsburg, Virginia. He served as a judicial law clerk for U.S. District Judge Sam Wilson in Roanoke, Virginia. from 1994 to 1996.
From 1997 to 2001, Brownlee served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in Washington, DC.
Military Service.
Brownlee was awarded an Army ROTC scholarship and graduated a Distinguished Military Graduate from Washington and Lee University. He was commissioned as an Infantry lieutenant and graduated from the Army's Airborne and Ranger programs. After serving four years on active duty in the Infantry, Brownlee joined the U.S. Army Reserve in the Judge Advocate General Corps. He received an honorable discharge in 2007 at the rank of Major.

Brownlee was sworn in as U.S. Attorney on August 30, 2001 and unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate on October 11, 2001.
Investigation of Purdue Pharma, LP, The Maker of OxyContin.
In May 2007, after a five-year investigation, the pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma, LP was convicted of illegally misbranding their pain medication OxyContin. OxyContin is a Schedule II prescription pain relief medication, classified as having the highest potential for abuse of legally available drugs. Purdue and the three executives admitted that Purdue fraudulently marketed OxyContin by falsely claiming that OxyContin was less addictive, less subject to abuse, and less likely to cause withdrawal symptoms than other pain medications when there was no medical research to support these claims and without Food and Drug Administration approval of these claims.
The company and executives paid over $634 million in fines, and the executives were placed on 3 years probation and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service. The settlement was one of the largest financial penalties ever imposed on a drug company. The New York Times claimed that “Purdue suffered a crushing defeat in May at the hands of Brownlee when the company and three top executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges.”
The investigation of Purdue and its executives was heralded as an important factor in preventing pharmaceutical companies from introducing dangerous and defective products into the marketplace. On July 31, 2007, Mr. Brownlee testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee regarding his investigation of Purdue and its executives.” During the hearing, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), referring to Mr. Brownlee, stated, “you stepped up, you led the fight, you really crushed their defense ultimately, and I am sure with this much at stake, they had some of the best lawyers in America involved in defending the case. This fine young United States Attorney committed several years of his life to this case and did something nobody else has done: put an end to this OxyContin abuse, which is an absolute national problem.” Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) stated that Brownlee’s work “will have a major impact on corporate conduct in our country.”
National Security Investigation, "United States v. ITT Corporation".
In March 2007, after a six-year investigation, ITT Corporation, the 12th largest supplier of sophisticated defense systems to the United States military, pled guilty to violating the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). ITT was convicted of illegally transferring classified and controlled night vision technology to foreign countries, including China, and agreed to pay $100 million in penalties. Brownlee was the first federal prosecutor to convict a major defense contractor of violating the ITAR.
ITT Corporation admitted that between March 2001 and August 2001, ITT Corporation exported defense related technical data to Singapore, the People’s Republic of China and the United Kingdom without having first obtained a license or written authorization from the U.S. Department of State. The technical data included information about a laser counter measure known as a “light interference filter” for military night vision goggle systems.
The investigation and prosecution of ITT Corporation created important industry reaction. Global Watch, a web based Newsletter of the International Import-Export Institute called the convictions “record breaking” and “precedent setting” and claimed that Brownlee’s work would have a “significant long-term impact on the trade compliance community worldwide.” The Wall Street Journal wrote that Brownlee’s “ITT case is bound to send shivers through the U.S. defense industry, which increasingly views international trade as vital for long-term growth.”
Use of the Violence Against Women Act, "United States of America v. Brent K. Simmons".
On October 12, 1996, Brent Simmons drove from Florida to Harrisonburg, Virginia, and brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend Ann Olson and her boyfriend Keith O’Connell after stalking and harassing both victims for months. Simmons was prosecuted by state authorities for both murders in 1998, but the jury was unable to agree on a verdict and a mistrial was declared. Several months later, the local prosecutor allowed Simmons to enter into a plea agreement to the murders in exchange for a 20-year term of imprisonment. Simmons was scheduled to be released from prison at the age of 41.
In 2003, the newly elected Commonwealth Attorney in Harrisonburg, Ms. Marsha Garst, asked Brownlee to review the case. Garst hoped that federal authorities could do something to keep Simmons from being released. After careful study, Brownlee developed a novel legal theory by using the Violence Against Women’s Act, which had been enacted only 13 days prior to the murders, and federal firearms charges.
In 2005, Brownlee charged Simmons with two counts of using a firearm during the commission of the violent crime of interstate stalking, made criminal by the 1996 Violence Against Women Act. After a 2-week trial in February 2005, the jury convicted Simmons of the two murders but was unable to reach a unanimous decision on the death penalty. Simmons was immediately sentenced by the trial court to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
First Federal Death Penalty Verdict in Western District of Virginia, "United States of America v. Carlos Caro".
In 2007, Brownlee and Assistant U.S. Attorney Tony Giorno prosecuted a federal inmate for committing a violent prison murder. The jury imposed the death penalty, the first federal death penalty conviction in the Western District of Virginia.
"United States v. Frank Cassell".
On November 2, 2006, a federal Grand Jury charged 20 defendants for their roles in a racketeering conspiracy that included the distribution of illegal drugs, theft of drugs and firearms under the custody of the Henry County Sheriff’s Office, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. Thirteen of the twenty defendants were current or former employees of the Henry County, Virginia Sheriff’s Office. Eighteen of the defendants, including the sheriff, were convicted of felony offenses, and two were placed on pre-trial diversion.
According to the indictment, since 1998, sworn officers, employees, and associates of the Henry County Sheriff’s Office engaged in a continuous scheme to steal narcotics, firearms, and other contraband from the seized evidence property room. The defendants took cocaine, crack cocaine, marijuana, and firearms, and then sold the stolen drugs and guns back into the community. The Grand Jury also has alleged that several of the defendants stole seized firearms and other contraband for their own personal use. 
Sheriff Frank Cassell was convicted of making false statements to agents of the FBI. Specifically, Sheriff Cassell had been told of various illegal activities involving Henry County Sheriff’s Deputies including the distribution of two kilograms of cocaine, embezzlement, and the use of steroids by several high-ranking members of the Henry County Sheriff’s Office. Cassell covered up these illegal activities in several ways; by not pursuing investigations and by agreeing to pass on any law enforcement information to the offending parties so they could avoid apprehension, by making false statements to federal investigators and by attempting to aid former Sergeant James Alden Vaught in a money laundering scheme to disguise the source of money represented to have been derived from the distribution of cocaine. Specifically, Cassell acknowledged that he attempted to help Vaught give $10,000 of known drug proceeds the appearance of legitimacy by cosigning for a loan for Vaught. Cassell then counseled Vaught to deposit small amounts of cash into a checking account to pay off the loan. In addition, Cassell agreed with Vaught never to mention the existence of the money derived from illegal drug distribution and then lied to investigators, saying he knew nothing about Vaught’s illegal drug activities.
"United States v. Carl B. Hutcherson".
In May 2005, Carl B. Hutcherson, the Mayor of Lynchburg, Virginia, was convicted of defrauding two social security disability recipients and a charitable organization, making false statements to bank officials and federal investigators and obstruction of justice.
The evidence at trial indicated that Mr. Hutcherson and Hutcherson Funeral Home, Inc. became mired in financial difficulties, and, among other things, failed to make required tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service in an amount in excess of $100,000, failed to maintain balances in banking accounts, failed to make required payments to the City of Lynchburg, Virginia, and failed to meet other financial obligations.
In response to his financial problems, Mr. Hutcherson committed a series of criminal acts in an effort to obtain money. Specifically, Mr. Hutcherson, as the representative payee for two Social Security disability recipients for whom Mr. Hutcherson managed their financial affairs, used their Social Security benefits for his own personal use. Mr. Hutcherson used the victims’ money and made cash payments to himself, purchased a television for himself, purchased a stereo for himself, purchased a mattress for another person, made a payment to an associate and purchased life insurance policies payable on the demise of Victim One with the beneficiary being Carl Hutcherson.
Also, Mr. Hutcherson, after being confronted with evidence that he stole money from his charity, provided false information to officials of the Bank of the James, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the federal Grand Jury.
Became Target After Rebuffing Justice Department.
Brownlee was included on the list of the second set of U.S. attorneys who were to be controversially fired in 2006. He testified before the Senate that his placement on the list was related to his refusal of a request by his superiors at the DOJ to delay settlement of the Purdue Pharma case in 2006.
2009 elections.
In 2008, Brownlee announced that he was running for Attorney General of Virginia. At the May 30, 2009 Republican Convention he yielded the nomination to Ken Cuccinelli.

<doc id="20296363" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20296363" title="Bhuvan">
Bhuvan

Bhuvan, (lit: Earth), is a software application which allows users to explore a 3D representation of the surface of the Earth. The browser is specifically tailored to view India, offering the highest resolution in this region provided with local four languages. A beta version was launched on 12 August 2009.
Overview.
ISRO launched the beta version of its web-based 3D satellite imagery tool, Bhuvan, on August 12, 2009. Bhuvan is supposed to offer more detailed imagery of Indian locations compared to other Virtual Globe software, with spatial resolutions ranging from 5 to 100 metres. Locations will be viewable from different perspectives, and the software will also provide functionality for the measurement of distances. The Bhuvan portal is designed to run on slow Internet connections. The images available do not include any military installations in India, due to security concerns.
Bhuvan has a number of other features, which include weather information and administrative boundaries of all states and districts in India. Bhuvan provides images of the entire globe, but resolution is currently best in India. On the Indian subcontinent, Bhuvan will be able to display pictures from a perceived altitude of 10 metres, at which height a commuter moving on a road can easily be spotted.
The National Remote Sensing Agency played an important role in the development of this product. ISRO has used data provided by satellites including Resourcesat-1, Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2 to get the best possible imagery of India. ISRO claims that the application can provide imagery from a perceived altitude of as little as 10 metres for major Indian cities, compared to the 200 metres provided by Google Earth.
Bhuvan-3D is based on TerraExplorer software, a product of Skyline Software Systems, thru the local Indian distributor RSI SOFTECH INDIA PVT LTD. Bhuvan-2D is developed using open-source software Geospatial solutions (UMN Mapserver, Geoserver, 52 North, OpenLayers). 2D images are available on all mobile browsers, including Apple's iOS.
Features.
Bhuvan allows users to view 2D and 3D images, along with information on soil, wasteland and water resources on the Indian subcontinent. Users can superimpose administrative boundaries of their choice, from a selection of boundaries available, on images as required. Bhuvan also allows visualization of AWS (Automatic Weather Station) data in the graphic view, as well as in tabular form. Users can "fly" from one location to another, and also navigate using the 3D view pop-up menu (with fly-in, fly out, jump in, jump around and view point controls). The software features Heads-Up Display (HUD) navigation controls (tilt slider, opacity control, compass ring and zoom slider). There is also a drawing function, which allows users to draw certain objects in both 2D (text labels, polylines, polygons, rectangles, 2D arrows, circles and ellipses) and 3D (placing of expressive 3D models, 3D polygons and boxes). Users can create snapshots (copies the 3D view to a floating window and allows to save to an external file) to record images and use measurement tools (horizontal distance, aerial distance, vertical distance, measure area) to record distances. Shadow analysis also allows a user to view terrain as it would appear at a specified time of day, by setting the sun position appropriately for the given time, thus creating accurate shadows and lighting.
ISRO plans to allow the end-user to participate in the development of features for the product in the future.
Some of the functionality planned for future versions includes:
Plugin download.
The Bhuvan plug-in is required only for accessing 3D images. The plugin can be downloaded from the Bhuvan website and can be installed without the need for any administrative privileges.
Technical requirements.
Bhuvan 2D is compatible with all browsers and operating systems and does not require any plug-in installation. Bhuvan 2D is based on the open source application Geo-spatial solutions. Bhuvan 2D can also be accessed through mobile phones also without any plugin installation.
The Beta version of Bhuvan 3D can run only on the Windows operating system and is optimized for Internet Explorer 6 and higher, with Protected Mode turned off. Bhuvan uses a TerraExplorer plugin from Skyline Inc., which is around 11 MB in size, and has to be installed prior to Bhuvan. The plugin is only supported on Internet Explorer for Microsoft Windows. Google Chrome, Firefox and other platforms are not yet supported.
Criticism.
Since the launch of Bhuvan, users have experienced various difficulties. One problem is that the Bhuvan site has, at various times, been either inaccessible or very slow (due to less band width and servers). Users are required to register before they can use the product, and downloads of plug-ins up to 11 MB in size are needed for the application to work. Furthermore, the plugin only works on Windows, and only Internet Explorer is supported. It renders layers unevenly and sometimes images are completely blocked. Bhuvan promises images from a perceived altitude of 10 metres, but technical analysts dispute the results. If many locations of same name exist, Bhuvan is supposed to give multiple results so that users can choose the intended location, but Bhuvan sometimes fails to return multiple results.
Another reason for the bhuvan is the height lock at 200 meters due to low res images being used, Images are also blurred.
Since the initial, buggy beta release, a more stable version has been released, with which users have reported fewer problems. A discussion forum has also been started for users experiencing difficulties.

Henry Doetsch

Henry Doetsch (31 January 1839 - 25 May 1894) was a German born industrialist who lived in London.
He was born Heinrich Moritz Doetsch the 31 January 1839 at the »Burghof«, the 17th century manor of his family in Kärlich (Mülheim-Kärlich, Weißenthurm, Rheinland). Because of a lung weakness, Henry (Enrique) Doetsch went (after a short time in Liverpool) as a young man of 23 years to Sevilla in Spain, where he entered with the help of his cousin, Moritz Willmar-Doetsch from Frankfurt/Main, as volunteer a British company. A few years later he was founder of the »Firma Sundheim y Doetsch« in Huelva (1865) with his compagnon Guillermo Sundheim (1840 - 1903). In 1873 Doetsch was the director of the Rio Tinto Company Limited, (RTCL), (Minas de Río Tinto), in London and Huelva. Together with Hugh Matheson, chairman of the Rio Tinto Company, and Guillermo (Wilhelm) Sundheim he built up a railway line in Andalucia: The »Compañía del Ferrocarril de Zafra a Huelva«. Doetsch held a patent in Canada for an extraction process to remove copper from its ores, registered in September 1879, so he was involved in mining and production of copper in Río Tinto by the so-called »Doetsch process«. But the use of Teladas poisoned the air and many residents became ill or died. Henry Doetsch fell out with Hugh Matheson on the issue of supply of the Miners (Sundheim had left the RTCL in 1876). During an uprising of the miners in 1888 more than 100 civilians were killed by Spanish soldiers.
Doetsch left Spain in autumn 1884, after he had invited his old friend »Fred« Burnaby to spend a month at Huelva. A few weeks later Burnaby gave up all his engagements, and fared forth for the Soudan. 
The three times offered title of a »Marqués de Río Tinto« by the Spanish King Alfonso XII refused Enrique Doetsch. He was awarded the grand cross of the Orden de Isabel la Católica. For many summertimes, Doetsch has been a traveling companion of the Infanta Maria de la Paz and the Infanta Eulalia of Spain. 
Henry Doetsch was succeeded at the Rio Tinto Group by his nephew Carlos Doetsch (1870 - 1951), who married in 1902 Justita Sundheim de la Cueva, daughter of Guillermo Sundheim and Justa de la Cueva y Camporedondo. The couple with the children Mercedes and Jorge lived in Huelva and Madrid.
In London Henry Doetsch lived as a respected financier at 7 New Burlington Street. A generous host and notorious bachelor, Doetsch opened his home and Art Gallery to an interested audience. Still in Spain Henry Doetsch started to collect pictures by old masters. Staying in contact with Bernard Berenson, masterpieces by great painters were gathered in the collection: Titian, Veronese, Guido Reni, Dolci, Lorenzo Lotto, Palma Vecchio, Pontormo, Bronzino, Andrea del Sarto, van Dyck, Rubens, Breughel, Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Wouwerman, Clouet and Holbein. Some of the paintings came from important galleries: Orléans-Galliera, Palazzo Vendramin (Henri Duc de Bordeaux), The Collection King Charles I, Pinacotece Lochis, or from privat collections as those of the Duke of Roxburghe, the Marquis of Donegall or Conte Alborghetti. 
Doetsch's evenings at New Burlington Street were famous: Among his guests the Prince of Wales (Edward VII), Lord Rosebery and his friend Colonel Burnaby. Doetsch was a lover of black Havana cigars; he died of pneumonia on 25 May 1894 in London.
After Doetsch's death in 1894, on 22nd, 24th and 25 June 1895, his pictures of Old Masters were auctioned by Christie's (Messrs. Christie, Manson and Woods), at their offices and sale rooms at 8 King Street, St. James's Square, and the sale appears to have been an enormous success. Some fine examples of paintings are now owned by H. M. the Queen and the House of Hesse at Kronberg. Henry Doetsch's career appears to have mirrored that of his countryman, Ludwig Mond, but Dr. Mond is remembered through the company that bears his name (Brunner-Mond) and the Mond Room at the National Gallery in London; Doetsch is largely forgotten. An Illustrated Catalogue of the Doetsch-Collection was prepared for Victoria, Empress Frederick (1895).

Hello, Harvest Moon

Hello, Harvest Moon is a children's book written by Ralph Fletcher and illustrated by Kate Kiesler. It was first published in 2003 by Clarion Books.
Plot summary.
The moon rises and shines through a girl's bedroom window. It then shines on a silent street, corn and wheat fields and autumn trees. A young girl and her cat play a game by its light, a pilot flies a plane using its light. The moon sets in the daylight as the young girl and her cat say goodnight.
Reception.
Shawn Brommer in his review for School Library Journal said "Fletcher's poetic prose makes use of gentle tempo and internal rhyme. Imaginative metaphors add to the text; as the moon sets, it sprinkles "silver coins like a careless millionaire." Careful use of second-person narrative draws readers into the text. Kiesler's luminous oil paintings portray the luscious moon glow, and a refrained use of brush stroke captures the mystery of nighttime when the familiar world becomes exotic, dazzling, and alive with nocturnal life. Warm hues evoke homey, autumn scenes." Terry Day in her review for Library Media Connection described it as a beautifully written and illustrated book. Publishers Weekly in their review said that "Fletcher's lyrical, child-friendly images will linger in readers' minds. With a gentle nod to Margaret Wise Brown, the child's morning is the moon's setting Ca sleepy head winking/ falling/slow motion/ onto its pillow"), and the book ends appropriately with the girl bidding, "Good night, harvest moon."" Kirkus Reviews said "Fletcher tracks that moon's nocturnal path in language rich in metaphor: "With silent slippers / it climbs the night stairs," "staining earth and sky with a ghostly glow," lighting up a child's bedroom, the wings of a small plane, moonflowers, and, ranging further afield, harbor waves and the shells of turtle hatchlings on a beach. Using creamy brushwork and subtly muted colors, Kiesler depicts each landscape, each night creature from Luna moths to a sleepless child and her cat, as well as the great moon sweeping across star-flecked skies, from varied but never vertiginous angles."

Eugene O'Dunne

Eugene O’Dunne or Eugene Antonio Dunne (June 22, 1875 – October 30, 1959) was a judge of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City.
Personal life.
Born in Tucson, O'Dunne was the son Judge Edmund F. Dunne, who was Chief Justice of the Arizona Territory at the time. His mother Josephine Cecelia Warner, though originally from Mississippi herself, was part of an old Virginia family. In 1894 he graduated from St. Mary's College (now Belmont Abbey) in North Carolina. Two years later he would receive an M.A. from St. Mary's as well. It was during this time that Eugene legally changed his last name to the ancestral family name of O'Dunne, while at the same time dropping his middle name of Antonio. This was done as to further emphasize his Irish heritage. He practiced law with his father in Jacksonville, FL at the firm of "Dunne and O'Dunne". He later went on to receive a law degree in 1900 from the University of Maryland.
In 1904, Judge O’Dunne was married to the great grandniece of John Quincy Adams. He and his spouse owned a home in Baltimore and a summer residence in Blue Ridge Summit, located in Pennsylvania. The couple had six children together: Mrs. E. Gettings Merryman, Eugene O’Dunne Jr., Mrs. John P Winand, Samillon O’Dunne, Hamilton O’Dunne and David O’Dunne. Eugene’s wife suffered from paralysis and died on August 30, 1935. Years after her death, O’Dunne would later remarry to Mrs. Helen Keep in 1950. Eugene O'Dunne is also the older brother of noted Santa Fe society columnist and author Brian Boru Dunne (1877–1962), who wrote for "The Santa Fe New Mexican" for most of the first half of the 20th century.
He died in 1959 in Ogunquit, ME at a home belonging to his second wife. O'Dunne was interred in the New Cathedral Cemetery in Baltimore City, Maryland. His father is buried there as well.
Beliefs.
O'Dunne was raised as a Roman Catholic. Despite the racism existing in Maryland, Judge O’Dunne ruled against segregation. He sought justice and enforced the law equally for Caucasians and African Americans. Pearson vs. Murray provided an example of this because he ruled against school segregation. O’Dunne favored neither the rich nor the poor, and applied the law equally among all individuals.
Career.
Throughout his judicial career, the community had favored O’Dunne for his respectful point of view regarding the rights of each person. After serving many years on the supreme bench of Baltimore, he retired from the bench in Baltimore at the mandatory age of 70. Although retired, O’Dunne was said to have remained active in legal affairs.
O’Dunne’s career as a judge on the Supreme Bench of Baltimore was filled with many ups and downs. There were times in his career that he felt as though he was being ‘muzzled’, and was never permitted to fully express his opinions. During his time spent as a judge on the Supreme Bench of Baltimore he was considered a fearless and fair leader in the judicial system. He was both respected and feared by the citizens of Baltimore and the members of the legal community alike. During his forty-five years as a judge he helped clean up many aspects of the legal system including, but not limited to; fixing the penal establishment, abolishing the ancient Black Hand of the Justices of the Peace, reorganizing the state’s legal business, and attacking on the old fee system. His most well-known court decision was made in the case of The University of Maryland v. Donald G. Murray, where he ruled in the favor of Donald G. Murray and started the movement that ended the discrimination against African-Americans applying to law schools in Maryland. He also was responsible for the desegregation of golf courses in the city of Baltimore; as long as the member dues were paid color was not to be a factor of who was allowed. He was known for his harsh sentences on minor criminal offences, such as robbery, but was not as harsh on those individuals that back talked and police, later being accused of disturbing the peace. He constantly fought corrupt members of the police department, lazy judges, and the press just to name a few. O’Dunne’s main goal was to keep the streets safe and free of any criminal behavior regardless of its degree of offence, but would become highly irritated with those police officers that tried to wrongfully accuse a man of a crime. After his retirement in 1945 at the age of seventy, he still continued to actively follow the legal issues of the city. One noted incident he took great interest in was the escape of Maryland State Penitentiary inmate, Joseph Holmes. When he received word that Holmes had escaped most would have expected him to believe along the lines that, “justice must prevail,” since he had spent many years as a Supreme Bench justice with that mentality. Instead he shocked the public with a quote from Shakespeare’s “Othello,” “I do perceive here a divided duty…” and continued to look at the prisoners escape as not a bad, but a good thing. Eugene O’Dunne spent twenty years of his life as a judge for the city of Baltimore in hopes of ridding the city of crime. During that time he made many friends and just as many enemies, but those who were a part of the legal system during O’Dunne’s years as a judge for the city of the Baltimore would all agree he was most certainly the most memorable judge of his time.
He also taught criminal law and medical juris-prudence at the University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins and the University of Baltimore. In retirement O'Dunne practiced law with one of his sons and worked as a public relations counsel for the local liquor industry.

Captain Lambert of the ship "Wachusett" reported that on June 4, 1899 he passed over a reef which appeared to be of coral formation in approximately latitude . The reef appeared to be about 500 feet wide. The bottom showed of a dark gray color with deep blue on both sides of the reef. The depth was estimated at from 5 to 6 fathoms; unfortunately no soundings were taken.
The 2005 edition of the "National Geographic Atlas of the World" still shows Wachusett Reef, with a depth of 9 meters. Nevertheless, its existence is doubtful. Other nearby historically reported reefs which appear to not exist include Ernest Legouve Reef, Jupiter Reef, and Maria Theresa Reef.

Paddy Stapleton

Patrick "Paddy" Stapleton (born 3 August 1985) is an Irish hurler who currently plays as a right corner-back for the Tipperary senior team. 
Stapleton made his first appearance for the team during the 2007 Waterford Crystal Cup and has become a regular player over the last few seasons. During that time he has won one All-Ireland winners' medals and two Munster winners' medals. He has ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions.
At club level Stapleton is a two-time North Tipperary medalist with Borris-Ileigh.
Playing career.
Club.
Stapleton plays his club hurling with the Borris-Ileigh club and has enjoyed some success. After enjoying little success at underage levels, he graduated onto the senior team where he won North Tipperary county titles in 2005 and 2007. Stapleton, however, is still waiting to line out in a senior county championship decider.
Minor & under-21.
Stapleton first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Tipperary minor hurling team in 2003. He collected a Munster winners' medal that year following a 2-12 to 0-16 defeat of Cork. Stapleton's side, however, were later defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final.
Three years later in 2006 Stapleton was a key fixture on the Tipperary under-21 hurling team. He was in his final year on the team when he secured a Munster winners' medal in that grade following a 3-11 to 0-13 defeat of Cork. Tipp were later qualified for the All-Ireland final against Kilkenny. After a thrilling 2-14 apiece draw, both sides met for a replay which Kilkenny narrowly won by 1-11 to 0-11.
Senior.
Stapleton made his senior competitive debut for Tipperary against Waterford in the pre-season Waterford Crystal Cup in 2007. He remained a fringe player for the next few years, coming on as a blood substitute in the All-Ireland semi-final defeat by Waterford in 2008.
In 2009 Stapleton was included on Tipperary's championship starting fifteen for the very first time. He won his first Munster medal that year as Tipp defeated Waterford by 4-14 to 2-16. After a six-week lay-off and a facile semi-final win over Limerick, a game which saw Stapleton pick up the man of the match award, Tipp qualified for an All-Ireland final meeting with Kilkenny. For much of the match it looked as if Tipp would pull off a shock and deny 'the Cats' a record-equaling four-in-a-row. Two quick goals in the space of a minute, one from a penalty by Henry Shefflin, sealed a 2-22 to 0-23 victory and defeat for Tipperary. Following the completion of the championship Stapleton was nominated for the All Star Team and Opel Gaelic Players' Association Team of the Year.
Stapleton remained as Tipperary's first-choice right corner-back once again in 2010. After surrendering their Munster title to Cork, Tipperray regrouped in the qualifiers and reached a second successive All-Ireland decider. Kilkenny, a team chasing an unprecedented fifth successive championship, provided the opposition and a great game was expected. Tipperary got off to a great start which was bolstered by an early Lar Corbett goal. He subsequently completed a hat-trick of goals and Tipperary had a fourth by Noel McGrath to deny Kilkenny's drive-for-five and secure a remarkable and convincing 4-17 to 1-18 victory. It was Stapleton's first All-Ireland winners' medal.
Tipperary returned as provincial kingpins once again in 2011. A 7-19 to 0-19 trouncing of Waterford in the southern decider gave Stapleton a second Munster medal. For the third successive year, Tipperary faced off against Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final, however, on this occasion Kilkenny were slight underdogs going up against the new champions. Kilkenny started quickly and never surrendered the lead in the 2-17 to 1-16 victory.
In 2012 Stapleton lost his place on Tipperary's starting fifteen.

In combinatorial mathematics, the Fishburn–Shepp inequality is an inequality for the number of extensions of partial orders to linear orders, found by and . 
It states that if "x", "y", and "z" are incomparable elements of a finite poset, then
where "P"(*) is the probability that a linear order < extending the partial order has the property *. 
In other words the probability that "x" < "z" strictly increases if one adds the condition that "x" < "y". In the language of conditional probability,

Relief A Quarterly Christian Expression

Relief: A Quarterly Christian Expression is a print on demand (POD) literary journal publishing poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction. "Relief" is run and distributed through ccPublishing, a nonprofit independent small press not affiliated with the Christian Booksellers Association (CBA) or the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association (ECPA). "Relief" strives to bridge the gap between conservative Christian writing and secular writing. As such, "Relief" is not "safe for the whole family," but encourages writers to write about the realities of living a faith-based life in today’s world.
Kimberly Culbertson describes the growing problem in Christian writing in an editorial statement:
The Christian writing rulebook often doesn’t have much room for imperfect characters
though. For example,Heather, Relief’s Assistant Editor, posted her poem "Stricter Judgment"
for critique on a popular writing site for Christians. The poem, which we’ve included in this
issue of Relief, deals with a waitress who serves a group of Christians, receives a tract for a tip,
and then swears under her breath. Having waitressed for many years, I can testify to the
authenticity of this moment, even to the general dislike of Christians among waiters because
of this type of behavior. As per the rules of the site, she bleeped out the forbidden word. It
took some time before people figured out what had been omitted, but as soon as they did, the
conversation was centered completely on that one word. One person even wrote something
like, “That foul-mouthed waitress probably needed the tract more than the tip.” It worked to
her benefit that the information superhighway separated us. There was little discussion about
the Christian characters who were oblivious to her needs or the biblical reference and layer of
meaning in the name of the poem; the readers missed the point. This incident seems indicative
of a larger problem with Christian writing—we worry about words, and we forget about
people. Christ said that we should know his followers by our love for each other, not by our
perfect behavior. So if you need to, brace yourself, because "Relief" deals with work that does
not sugar-coat or windex reality. Instead we seek to publish and honor writers who are able to
authentically express the realities of both life and Christ with exceptional craft.
Submissions.
"Relief" currently accepts submissions year-round through their online submission system only. Writers do not have to be Christian to submit. For complete submission guidelines and formatting instructions, please visit their website.

Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System

Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System (SAROPS) is a comprehensive search and rescue (SAR) planning system used by the United States Coast Guard in the planning and execution of almost all SAR cases in and around the United States and the Caribbean. SAROPS has three main components: The Graphical User Interface (GUI), the Environmental Data Server (EDS) and the Simulator (SIM). Using the Commercial Joint Mapping Tool Kit’s (C/JMTK) government licensing of the Geographic Information System (GIS) SAROPS can be used in both a coastal and oceanic environment. Built into the simulator is the ability to access global and regional wind and current data sets making SAROPS the most comprehensive and powerful tool available for maritime SAR planners.
Historical search planning tools.
Prior to SAROPS, SAR controllers in the U.S. Coast Guard used the Computer Assisted Search Planning (CASP) and Joint Automated Work Sheets (JAWS), which used dated search planning techniques and algorithms. More specifically, CASP was based on old computing technology and JAWS was taken directly from pen and pencil techniques for shorter durations of drift in coastal environments. Environmental data consisted of low-resolution (1-degree latitude/longitude grid) wind and current information that was applied every 12 hours. For most areas, CASP used monthly-averaged current values while JAWS used one wind and current value during the SAR case. Neither system was capable of accessing timely high-resolution wind nor current model output, which was a significant disadvantage since one of the main components that determine the accuracy of the drift solution is the presence of precise and accurate wind and current information for the given area of interest. 
Motivation for the development of SAROPS.
The U.S. Coast Guard uses a systematic approach for search and rescue operations. There are five SAR stages for any case: Awareness, Initial Actions, Planning, Operations and Conclusions. Upon becoming aware of a case from a “MAYDAY” call or other form of communication, SAR controllers work to gather data about the case and more often than not, there are many uncertainties in the initial report. The controller, then, must develop a search area based upon the information, estimate resource availability and capability, promulgate the search plan and deploy the resources. While the assets are conducting a search, the controller begins the process again by gathering additional information, developing a subsequent search, deploying resources and evaluating previous searches. This process continues until the survivors are found and rescued or proper authorities suspend the SAR case. Consequently, there is a need for a tool that is fast, simple, minimizes data entry, minimizes potential for error, can access high-resolution environmental data, and create search action plans that maximize the probability of success. Furthermore, the National Search and Rescue Plan of the United States (2007), challenges search and rescue communities in the following passage:Recognizing the critical importance of reduced response time in successful rescue and similar efforts, a continual focus will be maintained on developing and implementing means to reduce the time required for: 
a. Receiving alerts and information associated with distress situations;
b. Planning and coordinating operations;
c. Facility transits and searches;
d. Rescues; and 
e. Providing immediate assistance, such as medical assistance, as appropriate.
If this is not motivation enough, a USCG rotary-wing aircraft costs $9–14K per hour and a USCG cutter costs $3–15K per hour to operate. Reducing the time an aircraft is airborne or a cutter is in a search area can considerably reduce taxpayer costs as well as save lives and property. The U.S. Coast Guard contracted Northrop Grumman Corporation, Applied Science Associates (ASA), and Metron Inc., to develop a comprehensive system that included the latest graphical divergence parameters, Leeway divergence parameters, and Monte-Carlo methods to improve the probability of success of search cases. SAROPS meets and exceeds these expectations by minimize planning and response time frames.
SAROPS components.
SAROPS is made up of the Graphical User Interface (GUI), the Environmental Data Server (EDS) and the Simulator (SIM). 
Graphical User Interface (GUI).
The Graphical User Interface uses the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Geographic Information System (ArcGIS) and has been altered to include U.S. Coast Guard specific applications such as the SAR Tools Extension and SAROPS Extension. The applications have a wizard-based interface and work within the ArcGIS layered environment. Vector and raster charts are available for display as well as search plans, search patterns, search area environmental data, and probability maps. Finally, the GUI provides reports on all search operations.
Environmental Data Server (EDS).
The Environmental Data Server (EDS) collects and stores environmental information for use within SAROPS. Local SAROPS servers around the United States request environmental information from the EDS based upon the area of interest. Different environmental products are cataloged on the server ranging from observational systems to modeling products. Observations include sea surface temperature, air temperature, visibility, wave height, global/region tides and currents to name a few. High-resolution model output from operational forecast models like the hybrid coordinate ocean model (HYCOM) and Global NRL Coastal Ocean (NCOM) provide temporally and spatially varying wind and current information. Lastly, the EDS is capable of providing objective analysis tools and aggregation. The list of available products is always changing as researchers in the Navy, local universities and research centers continually improve the accuracy and reliability of products and make them available on a consistent basis.
SAROPS Simulator (SIM).
Simulator Wizard.
The simulator wizard makes use of multiple pages of scenario descriptions that are entered by the user in order to compute the possible distress positions and times, subsequent search object drift trajectories, and the effect of completed searches on the search object probabilities. The simulator captures uncertainty in positions, time environmental inputs and leeway parameters. Upon receiving all of the information pertinent to the case, the simulator, using Markov's Monte Carlo method, simulates the drift of up to 10,000 particles for each scenario. For every 20 minutes of drift, the simulator accounts for changes in water current, wind leeway and leeway divergence. The simulator displays the results as a probability density map that can be animated over the drift duration. Figure 1 depicts this type of map. The ensemble trajectory model, random walk and random flight model governing equations are fully explained in Breivik and Allen (2008) and Spaulding, et al. (2005) that is located within O’Donnell, et al. (2005). In short, the goal of the simulator is to maximize the probability of success.
Optimal Planning Wizard.
The optimal planning wizard takes the probability map information as well as another set of user inputs such as the type of resources, on scene conditions and sweep width values to develop search areas that maximize the POS. The search areas can be adjusted by the SAR controller to further maximize POS. Armed with the best possible fit given available resources, the SAR controller can then transmit the search pattern to the search assets. If the search object is not found on the first search, the optimal planning wizard will account for previous unsuccessful searches when recommending subsequent searches.
Applications outside of search and rescue.
SAROPS may be expanded to include other applications outside of search and rescue. These applications may include but are not limited to the projection of fisheries stocks and oil spill projections. 
Real world use.
SAROPS was utilized in the response to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and assisted in the ultimate recovery of 115 persons.

Donald C. Johnson (born 1949) is an American career diplomat who served as U.S. Ambassador to three countries; Equatorial Guinea, Cape Verde and Mongolia.
Early life and education.
Johnson grew up in Mexico. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Lewis & Clark College and his J.D. from Lewis & Clark Law School. He earned a Master of Public Administration from the University of Oklahoma in 1975. He received his LL.M in corporation law from the George Washington University Law School.
Career.
Johnson entered the United States Foreign Service in 1974. His first post was as Third Secretary in Guatemala. Other overseas postings have been in Moscow, Taipei, Beijing, Madrid, and Tegucigalpa. Domestic assignments include service as a Desk Officer at the State Department and service on the National Security Council at the White House.
Career highlights include earthquake relief in Guatemala; liaison with human rights groups in the former Soviet Union; ; negotiation of drug control and status of forces agreements in Honduras.
Before becoming U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia (1993–1996), Johnson had traveled to Ulaanbaatar before the U.S. had established diplomatic relations. He was also instrumental in concluding numerous trade and scientific agreements during his tenure.
From 1996 to 1997 he was Head of Mission in Moldova for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Between 1997 and 1999 he was one of three members of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning during the Northern Ireland peace process. While serving on the Commission, he led the team that carried out the very first voluntary decommissioning of paramilitary weapons in Northern Ireland, which saw the destruction of submachine guns, handguns, ammunition and improvised explosives. 
From 2002 to 2005 he served as U.S. Ambassador to Cape Verde. During his service, Cape Verde was one of the first 16 countries to qualify for the Millennium Challenge Account, and prior to the completion of his Cape Verde assignment, Cape Verde signed a $110 million Compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation to fund major infrastructure and water improvements. In addition, Cape Verde became only the sixth country in Africa to achieve Category 1 status for its civil aviation, and in July 2005, Cape Verde’s airline began direct flights to the U.S. 
From the fall of 2005 until June 2006, Ambassador Johnson worked in the U.S. Mission to the Organization of American States, leading the U.S. team in the negotiations for a Social Charter of the Americas.

Crimes Town Gallery

The Crimes Town Gallery in Stoke Newington has been operating since July 2007. The gallery is run by Gavin Toye and Ben Newton who are both artists. In May 2008 Toye and Newton staged, "Walpurgisnacht" at their gallery, a group show featuring artists such as Cathy Lomax, James Unsworth and Sarah Sparkes. Walpurgisnacht is traditionally the biggest Witches Sabbath of the year, the time when the forces of the supernatural meet with the mortal world. This show was previewed in the Guardian Guide by Jessica Lack.
In June 2008 guest curator Harry Pye organised a group show called, "Poetic Licence". This exhibition featured sixteen artists including John Moseley, Barry Thompson, and Edward Ward.
Each of the show's contributors made a painting or drawing that was inspired by their love of a favourite poem.

Ballaglass Glen is an intermediate stopping place on the northerly section of the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man.
Location.
The halt is located at the entrance to the national glen of the same name and is served only by rail, there being no direct road access to this location.
Facilities.
A wooden waiting shelter which features a sprung gate which is to stop sheep from getting trapped inside it, such is the rural nature of the Manx Electric Railway and its environs. The current shelter was erected in 1987 replacing an earlier version of corrugated iron construction.
Substation.
Nearby in a southerly direction is the sub-station building which can be seen through the trees from passing trams; today the majority of this building houses a private dwelling complete with swimming pool in the old boiler house, although a small sub-station still exists on site.

Contractual Assessments: energy efficiency improvements, Assembly Bill 811 (AB 811) is an environmental law in California signed into law by Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger on July 21, 2008. AB 811 was authored by Assemblyman Lloyd Levine.
AB 811 authorized all California cities and counties to designate areas within which willing property owners could enter into contractual assessments to finance the installation of distributed renewable energy generation, as well as energy efficiency improvements, that are permanently fixed to the property owner's residential, commercial, industrial, or other real property. These financing arrangements would allow property owners to finance renewable generation and energy efficiency improvements through low-interest loans that would be repaid as an item on the property owner's property tax bill. The contractual assessments could not be used to finance the purchase or installation of appliances that are not permanently fixed to the real property.
Assembly Bill 811 helps California municipalities accomplish the goals outlined by Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006
The passage of AB 811 makes it more imperative to provide an energy efficiency community program. AB 811 states: "This act is an urgency statute...". Cities and counties can now: (1)Make energy-efficiency and renewable energy affordable for California citizens (2)Increase property values (3)Improve the efficiency and indoor air quality of residential & commercial properties (4)Reduce the burning of dirty fuels and hence, pollution (5)Lower greenhouse gas emissions (6)Empower constituents with the fiscal security of distributed energy.

Patrick Wanis

Patrick Wanis is an Australian human behavior and relationship expert, clinical hypnotherapist, life coach and author based in the United States. He has coached various celebrities such as Hulk Hogan and Latin band Xtreme and is recognized as a Celebrity Life Coach. Wanis is a co-host of the TV show "Emotional Mojo."
He has published numerous books on human behavior, relationships, and the mind. He has been featured as a relationship expert and columnist for Date.com and Matchmaker.com, is the human behavior and relationship expert for AMI Mini Mags, a featured behavior and relationship expert for Playboy Radio and is the relationship expert to CupidDates.net, The National Association of Divorce for Women and Children and the 2010 motion picture "The Putt Putt Syndrome."
Early career.
Wanis began working as a radio show host at Radio 2RG Griffith while also serving as anchor of the regional television news on MTN-9, and hosted regional segments of the "Royal Melbourne Children’s Hospital Telethon." In 1985, he became the youngest talk show host in Australia at age 23 for Radio 7BU with syndicated talk shows on TBN - The Tasmanian Broadcasting Network (including a Sunday night "Lonely Hearts" call-in show) and interviewing the Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke on numerous occasions. He also won First Prize in the Australian Tourism Awards for Tas Travel – his weekly syndicated radio show. Wanis next became a talk show host for Canberra’s news/talk radio 2CA and Political reporter for Ten News television, in Canberra interviewing the Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke on television on numerous occasions and interviewing the candidates for Canberra’s inaugural state elections before becoming executive producer of 3AK Talk-back radio in Melbourne, serving as executive producer for the Don Chipp morning radio show and hosting his own afternoon drive talk show. Wanis also presented a live radio show from Australia's Parliament House, Canberra on the eve of the 1990 Federal Election.
Wanis received the ranking of "A+++ Grade Journalist" (the highest industry grading possible) from the Australian Journalists Association.
In 1990, Radio 3AK was sold to businessman Peter Corso who sacked most of its workforce in preparation to relaunch 3AK as Australia's first commercial Italian-language radio station. While interviewing Corso live on-air, Corso offered Wanis the opportunity to stay on as a broadcaster and show host. Wanis declined, stating he was going to travel overseas for three months.
Wanis subsequently began working and traveling in Africa, England, Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, and the United States. He performed hypnosis, dance, comedy, musicals, and murder mystery musicals in multiple languages. Wanis claims that in 1991, he became the first person to introduce pantomime musicals to West Africa, with his own original musical parodies of "Snow White", "Cinderella", and "Little Red Riding Hood". Wanis directed and co-hosted the "1991 Miss Africa World Beauty Pageant." In the Gambia, West Africa, Wanis observed and studied the link between the belief in spells, curses, Juju, witchcraft, healing doctors (using witchcraft) and the behavior of the Gambian people and their various tribes. Wanis concluded that the spells and curses only had power over those people who believed in them, forming a basis for his later work and studies in hypnotherapy and the power of the mind and beliefs.
In 1993, Wanis directed and co-hosted (in English and Spanish) "Miss Verano" beauty pageant in Spain before a live audience of 5,000 people; produced and co-hosted the 1993 "Junior Miss" and "Junior Mister" for 2000 children in Spain and won awards by Thomson Tours 1991, 1992 and 1993 for "Best Entertainment - The Gambia, West Africa". In 1993, European TV program, Canal Plus "24 Horas" did a feature on Wanis.
Hypnosis.
In Spain (Ibiza and Salou), Wanis began to perform stage hypnosis shows. His first shows used stooges (actors); Wanis claims he got the inspiration after watching another English performer do the same thing in a resort in Ibiza. Wanis began to read books about hypnosis and hypnotherapy to provide a convincing show and hypnotic induction. One day in Cozumel, Wanis decided to leave a few volunteers up on stage with the stooges/actors as an experiment and two of those volunteers became hypnotized during the hypnotic induction. Subsequently, Wanis would have less stooges and more volunteers in his weekly shows, until he eventually stopped using stooges and actors, and only used real volunteers. While on vacation in Cozumel, a psychologist from Canada saw Wanis’ hypnosis show and suggested that Wanis study hypnotherapy. Wanis began to use hypnosis to work with clients wanting to lose weight and stop smoking and in 1993 began to study with the IACT (International Association of Counselors and Therapists) which Wanis became critical of for allegedly handing out hypnosis certification to anyone who paid and completed a weekend training program.
In 1995, he graduated from W.I.C.S. in Pennsylvania with degrees in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and Advanced Hypnotherapy. In 1995, Wanis became the first resident hypnotist on Carnival Cruise Lines, and was invited to Las Vegas to meet David Copperfield. While working on the cruise ships, Wanis also began motivational and training programs and workshops for Steiners’ Salons, Carnival Cruises.
In 1996, he produced, performed and directed New Line’s "The Mask!" in a live musical production. Wanis went on to consult on a TV comedy variety show version of "The Mask!" with New Line Television. Meanwhile, after witnessing Wanis’ hypnosis show "Hipnotica" a United States production company sponsored him to come to America. In 1996, he co-produced Al Gore’s visit to Orlando during the 1996 campaign. In 1998, he was a regular co-host and hypnotherapist on the syndicated radio show "America Talks Health".
He created and produced the show "Blues Brothers 2000" for Daytona (licensed by the Belushi Estate) for a live audience of over 195,000 people.
Children and teens' issues.
From 1996-1998, Wanis volunteered with the department of Youth Education and the Children’s Ministry for Unity Church of Christianity Houston, Texas, serving as a Sunday morning teacher and event leader for Uniteens (10 to14 year-olds) and he wrote, directed and produced two full scale Christmas musicals involving children, teens and adults for the church in 1996 & 1997.
In 2001, Wanis voluntarily directed the 7th annual televised Celebrity Mascot Games (NBA, NFL, Major League Baseball, NHL and NCAA) to raise money for the New Hope Children’s Wish Foundation (now known as New Hope For Kids) and also co-hosted various television talk show specials with teens on terrorism and the September 11 attacks in 2001 and "September 11 – One Year On."
Since 2000, Wanis has presented motivational training programs for various schools in Florida, Texas and New York, and in Australia.
Recent years.
In 2002, Wanis began to write pocketbooks (Mini-mags and Micro-mags) for American Media, starting with "How to Hypnotize Anyone." With the publication of more titles and books, he became recognized as a relationship expert and soon after as a human behavior expert. Subsequently, he was regularly featured and interviewed on syndicated radio and TV shows including Mike and Juliet Morning show, Montel Williams show, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, HLN, TruTV, Fox news online and magazines Cosmopolitan, VIVA and The New York Observer.
Wanis has often spoken out publicly on television, radio and in print about celebrity narcissism and meltdowns. In 2007, Wanis began his annual list of The Top Ten Celebrity Meltdowns and became recognized as the expert on celebrity meltdowns; his list is featured each year on FOX News Channel.
In November 2011, Chaz Bono threatened to sue the National Enquirer over an article that cited Wanis and which claimed Bono's weight, stress, and the medications and issues associated with his gender reassignment, could increase the likelihood of an early death. Wanis was cited in the Enquirer article as a Human Behavior Expert (and contrary to claims by Bono’s attorney, Wanis was not cited or credited as a transgender specialist or medical doctor.) The following day, Wanis recorded a personal video message to Bono heeding him to "ignore the sensationalism of the Enquirer headlines such as ‘liver damage agony’ but still take action about his health, to surround himself only with people that really care, and to beware of Hollywood’s parasites."
Women's issues.
Wanis has often criticized Hollywood, the media and advertising for their portrayal of women and the sexualization of young girls and babies. "Women are bombarded everyday with advertising and messages that there is something wrong with them, something missing – all of these reality shows target the insecurity of women" he told Fox News.
Wanis also claims the media often ignores domestic violence against women and instead gives priority to racism. Wanis criticized television executives for ignoring Charlie Sheen's violent behavior against his wife (Sheen pleaded guilty to assaulting Brooke Mueller in 2010) and for waiting for Sheen to make partial racial slurs against his boss before firing Sheen from the hit TV show "Two and a Half Men."
In July 2010, eight months prior to Charlie Sheen’s infamous meltdown, Wanis told Alan Stock of Newsradio 840 KXNT Las Vegas and Russ Morley 850 WFTL Newstalk radio Miami: "We are showing favoritism towards Charlie Sheen. We watch Charlie Sheen on his weekly TV show and for almost 7 years, and we welcome his TV character and welcome him in life as a bad boy but we refuse to see him as a man who has abused a woman. The reality of his abuse, of his violence against a woman, is ignored because people generally seem to like him, to find him affable, viewing him as basically just a boy who is slightly wild and has not yet grown up. If we had heard the conversation between Charlie and his wife, would we still be giving him the free-pass? People quickly condemned Chris Brown for assaulting Rihanna but was that because we saw the photo of her bruised face or because Chris Brown is black and so our bias and prejudice spiked our anger and condemnation?"
In March 2011, Wanis criticized toymaker Mattel for its Clawdeen doll stating that it is actually "encouraging a young girl to dress like a stripper" and to believe that she should be sexually enticing to everyone around her. Wanis also criticized clothing retail chain, Abercrombie & Fitch, for marketing padded bikini tops to girls as young as eight years of age, stating to Fox News that the padded tops are both disturbing and dangerous: "Are we sexualizing young girls to get the attention of men or to encourage women to use their daughters to compensate for their own lack of sexual appeal by living vicariously through their daughter?" Wanis asked. "Is this the extreme extension of the beauty-pageant mother who now seeks to make up for what she can never be?"
In March 2012, Wanis criticized Lifetime Television and Abby Lee Miller (the founder and chief choreographer of The Abby Lee Dance Company) for potentially creating a playground for pedophiles and sexual predators over an episode of the TV show "Dance Moms" titled “Topless Showgirls” which features girls as young as eight performing a sexually charged, provocative showgirl-like routine in a local dance competition, donning tiny sparkly flesh-colored bras and panties to give the illusion of nudity. In the TV episode, Miller recites to the girls as she teaches them the dance moves: “I’m hot, I’m mean, you can’t have me, you can’t afford me.” Referring to the simulated nude costumes and sexual dance movements such as thrusting their chests forward and backward, Wanis told Fox News that “This condones, encourages and motivates adults to imagine little girls dancing naked for their pleasure. ..Of course it will arouse pedophiles and offer them a new legal avenue to engage in their lustful thoughts as they watch the little girls ‘nude’ on television.”

Flora of Italy

The flora of Italy is the richest in Europe. Traditionally it was estimated to comprise about 5,500 vascular plant species. However, as of 2004, 6,759 species are recorded in the "Data bank of Italian vascular flora". About 700 of them are endemic to the country. Geobotanically, the Italian flora is shared between the Circumboreal Region and Mediterranean Region. According to the index compiled by the Italian Ministry for the Environment in 2001, 274 vascular plant species are protected.
Because of the differences in the climate between the mainland and the peninsular regions, there is a different vegetation within the country. The altitude plays a big role in the diversuty of the flora: the more it gets higher, the more the climate and the ground are unfavourable to the development of plants. In fact in Italy there are three different types of vegetation:
1.evergreen vegetation: it is the mediterranean type of vegetation, with plants and bushes that always have leaves on. This flora is typical of the dry mediterranean climate, especially along the coast and in the islands. The most common plants are olives, maritime pines, oaks, myrtles, junipers. 
2.broad-leaved vegetation ( oaks, beeches, chestnuts): it is typical of the mountain region with a humid climate ( Apennines and Prealps).
3.coniferous vegetation ( larches, pines, firs): it is an evergreen vegetation typical of the alpine area.
As soon as it gets higher than 1400 meters, the vegetation is sparser and there is more mountain grasslands and various shrubs and coloured flowers.
Humans have been transforming the land in order to farm it and get products, such as potatoes, cereals and a lot of grapes up until 800 metres above sea level. In fact over 800 meters the vegetation is mostly made of beeches and chestnuts and over 1200 we found only coniferous vegetation up until about 2000 metres.

David Gandy

David James Gandy (born 19 February 1980 in Billericay, Essex, England) is a British model. He grew up in Essex in a working-class family. After winning a televised model-search competition, he became a successful model. For several years, Gandy was the lead male model for Italian designers Dolce & Gabbana who featured him in their campaigns and fashion shows.
In an industry dominated by skinny models, Gandy's muscular build caused some menswear fashion designers to move to a more masculine standard. The increase in his popularity and name recognition resulted in a broad portfolio of magazine covers, editorial photo shoots, interviews and industry awards. He has gone on to participate in fashion-related and personal projects such as writing a blog for British "Vogue", writing car reviews for British "GQ", mobile app development and charity work.
Modelling career.
Background.
In his youth, Gandy wanted to be a veterinarian but his grades were not high enough to meet the needed standards for that line of study. So, while studying multimedia computing, he went to work for "Auto Express", delivering the latest Porsches and Jaguars to the track for testing. Before graduating from the University of Gloucestershire with a Marketing degree, Gandy's flatmate entered him (without his knowledge) into a modelling competition on ITV’s "This Morning" hosted by Richard and Judy. The 21-year-old Gandy won the competition which included a contract with Select Model Management in London.
Work.
During the early years of his career, Gandy modelled for a variety of companies including: Shiatzy Chen, 7 for all Mankind, Zara, Gant U.S.A., Hugo Boss, Russell & Bromley, H&M, Carolina Herrera, Massimo Dutti and others. In 2006, he became the face of Dolce & Gabbana, annually starring in their apparel campaigns and fashion shows through 2011, working with female supermodels such as Gemma Ward, Scarlett Johansson and Naomi Campbell as well as male models including Noah Mills, Tony Ward and Adam Senn.
Gandy is best known for the 2007 advert of Dolce & Gabbana's fragrance "Light Blue" with Marija Vujovic (shot by photographer Mario Testino) which had 11 million online hits and saw a 50-foot billboard of him displayed in Times Square. He modelled for their 2008 calendar, shot by photographer, Mariano Vivanco. Gandy returned as the face of the second "Light Blue" fragrance campaign for 2010, but this time with Anna Jagodzinska. He also made a short promotional film for W Hotels with Helena Christensen called "Away We Stay".
In 2011, the fashion house published "David Gandy by Dolce & Gabbana", a 280-page photographic coffee table book of images chronicling their years of collaboration. That same year, Gandy shot four magazine covers and five fashion editorial photoshoots. In 2012, he was featured on sixteen magazine covers, eighteen fashion editorials and modelled for Banana Republic, Lucky Brand Jeans, El Palacio de Hierro and Marks & Spencer. In addition, Gandy was named the brand ambassador for Johnnie Walker Blue Label.
In 2013, Dolce & Gabbana released the third version of the “Light Blue” fragrance campaign featuring Gandy. Once again, Mario Testino filmed the adverts and commercial on location in the island of Capri, southern Italy but this time with Italian model Bianca Balti in the female role. Bionda Castana, a British shoe label, released a fashion film featuring Gandy called "David Gandy's Goodnight." In it, he seduces several women who discover later that he has stolen their shoes. On 26 September, Gandy and Jaguar released a short film called "Escapism" which featured Gandy driving models such as the C-Type, E-Type, XKSS as well as the new F-Type. In November, Marks & Spencer launched their 2013 Christmas advertising campaign, "Magic & Sparkle". The fairy-tale-themed commercial featured Rosie Huntington-Whiteley with Helena Bonham Carter and Gandy.
Other endeavours.
Fashion projects.
In September 2011, Gandy was named the spokesman for the Martini’s “Luck Is An Attitude” campaign, launching their model-search competition on the Spanish Steps of Rome, which were opened specifically for the event. He was appointed to serve on the British Fashion Council's Committee to launch "London Collections: Men" as part of London Fashion Week 2012.
During the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, Gandy was the only male to walk the Union Jack-shaped catwalk featuring British fashions, alongside models Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Jourdan Dunn, Lily Donaldson, Georgia May Jagger, Karen Elson and Stella Tennant. For the occasion, he wore a gold bespoke suit by British designer Paul Smith. Gandy was invited to the Oxford Union again on 19 November 2012 with Alex Bilmes, Editor of "Esquire" to discuss "The importance of men's fashion."
On 28 April 2013, Gandy participated in the 2013 Vogue Festival as part of a panel discussing, "Too Fat, Too Thin, Will We Ever Be Content?" The panel, chaired by Vogue's editor-in-chief, Fiona Golfar, also included model Daisy Lowe, child star Patsy Kensit and Vogue contributing editor Christa D’Souza.
Writing and other pursuits.
After receiving his racing license in 2012, Gandy was invited to be one of the drivers in the 2013 Mille Miglia (“1,000 Mile”) race in Italy. Each year, the three-day event passes through nearly 200 Italian towns from Brescia to Rome and back, recreating the original races which took place between 1927 and 1957. He and his co-driver, Yasmin Le Bon, were part of “Team Jaguar”, driving a 1950 XK120. Early in the race, Gandy and Le Bon were “pushed off the road by a competitor” which caused body damage to the fender and side of the vintage car. They re-entered the race, ultimately finishing in 158th place out of 415 cars.
On 12 September 2013, The Daily Telegraph launched a new men's lifestyle section called "Telegraph Men". They announced that Gandy would be a contributing columnist.
Accolades.
Gandy has been nominated for or received several awards in the modelling industry. In 2008, Spanish "Glamour" magazine named him "Most Beautiful International Male Face" at an event in Madrid, Spain. On 26 June 2009, "Forbes" magazine ranked him as the world's third most successful male model, behind Matt Gordon and Sean O'Pry.

United Nations Fourth Committee

The United Nations Fourth Committee of the UN General Assembly (also known as the Special Political and Decolonization Committee) is one of six committees of the United Nations (consisting of all UN members). After the dismantling of the trusteeship system resulting from independence being granted to all the trust territories, and the now-limited number of non-self-governing territories, that jurisdiction is insufficient to keep the committee occupied. Consequently, it was merged with the Special Political Committee (which had been created as a seventh committee of the whole to deal with certain political issues after the General Assembly found that the First Committee (Disarmament and Political) was too busy. The Fourth Committee deals with decolonization, Palestinian refugees and human rights, peacekeeping, mine action, outer space, public information, atomic radiation and the University for Peace.

Jane Brody

Jane Ellen Brody (born May 19, 1941) is an American author on science and nutrition topics, who has written a number of books and reported extensively for "The New York Times" as its "Personal Health" columnist, which appears weekly in the paper's Science Times section, which has been syndicated nationwide. She has been called the "High Priestess of Health" by "Time" magazine.
Biography.
Brody was born on May 19, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York. She attended the New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell University (now the Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences), where she majored in biochemistry as part of a plan to become a research scientist, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1962. She found that she couldn't achieve her goals of "looking for ways to help people lead better lives" as a biochemist and developed an interest in journalism after writing for her college newspaper during her senior year. She became interested in using her knowledge of science to convey information to the public and enrolled at the School of Journalism of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, graduating in 1963 with a Master's degree in science writing.
After graduating, she spent two years as a general assignment reporter at the "Minneapolis Tribune". Unaccustomed to what she called "Midwestern reticence", she responded to the isolation and loneliness by eating, ballooning up from 105 to as much as 140 pounds. She had an epiphany one night and decided that "if I was going to be fat, at least I was going to be healthy". She started changing her eating habits, eating regular meals and taking along healthy snacks. She lost the weight and never regained it.
She returned to New York City in 1965 and was hired by "The New York Times" as its specialist in covering medicine and biology. She was asked by the Times to write the Personal Health column, which she began in 1976 despite her initial reluctance. Her column has been syndicated by more than 100 papers across the United States.
She has become devoted to exercise, and in the 1980s her routine included singles tennis five days a week (less in winter), she would head out daily after rising at 5 a.m. and preparing breakfast for her family, for a 3½-mile run or ten-mile bike ride, followed by a half-mile swim in the evening.
Brody's approach to eating focuses on moderation, emphasizing potatoes, rice, pasta, dried peas and beans, bread (without butter), bulgur and kasha, accompanied with moderate amounts of low-fat dairy products, fish and shellfish, lean meats and poultry. Before helping her type the manuscript for "Jane Brody's Nutrition Book", her late husband Richard Engquist, a confirmed meat-and-potatoes eater, switched his focus from meat to potatoes and ended the year 26 pounds lighter.
Books Brody has written include "Jane Brody's Nutrition Book" and "Jane Brody's Good Food Book", both of which were bestsellers. "Jane Brody's Guide to the Great Beyond: A Practical Primer for Preparing for the End of Life" was released in early 2009.

Quest (TV channel)

Quest is a TV channel in the United Kingdom. Quest provides factual, lifestyle, entertainment programmes and other imported material. The channel is operated by Discovery Networks Western Europe.
History.
In October 2008, Discovery announced that they would launch a channel on Freeview in early 2009, but without using the "Discovery" name. A placeholder appeared on Freeview channel 47 on 5 January 2009 and Tiscali TV channel 109 on 14 May 2009. Although the channel planned to launch on 14 May 2009 at 10am, after broadcasting a promo loop on the planned launch morning, at 10am the channel returned to displaying a "Coming soon" message.
The Quest website displayed a message reading: "Regrettably we have made the decision to postpone the launch of Quest. Due to a number of commercial factors we have had to make this difficult decision. We did not make this decision lightly and we are working towards launching Quest in the near future. We would like to apologise wholeheartedly to any of you that have been looking forward to this launch."
In August 2009, Discovery Networks announced that it planned to launch the channel on 30 September 2009. At the same time the channel moved to channel 38.

Quest +1 launched on Sky, replacing DMAX +1.5 on 2 November 2009.
Quest launched on Virgin Media on 25 March 2010 on channel 179.
It is notable for cropping the top and bottom from 4:3 programming in order to make it 16:9. Furthermore, if the channel is viewed with a receiver set to 4:3, the sides are cropped from the image (including cutting the channel logo in half) meaning only the very centre of the original picture is viewable.
On 15 October 2010, Quest began broadcasting a 24-hour schedule on all platforms except Freeview. On 30 June 2011, Gems TV acquired a 24 hour Freeview stream, ending their timeshare with Quest, allowing Quest to begin broadcasting for 24 hours a day on Freeview as well.At the beginning of March 2014 Quest+1 appeared on Freeview channel 57.

Belle Vue Halt

Belle Vue (For Port-E-Vullen) is an intermediate stopping place on the northern section of the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man.
Location.
It is situated between Lewaigue Station and Ramsey, the line's northern terminus. The poles bearing the overhead lines on the M.E.R. are numbered from Douglas and Belle Vue can be found at pole 846. The halt is located on the A15 road to Maughold Village and is actually closer to Port Lewaigue than to Port-E-Vullen.
Shelter.
Until 2001, there was a corrugated iron lineside shelter at the stop. Following some local controversy over its demolition, it was eventually replaced by a wooden structure originally located at Port Jack, north of Douglas.
Upkeep.
The station is tended to by a group of locals who annually decorate the shelter and surroundings with flower beds and hanging baskets as well as attending to the general clenliness of the area.

Queens Drive Halt

Queens Drive is an intermediate stopping place on the northern section of the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man.
Location.
Due to the nature of the tramway's construction, the cars can stop and drop off almost anywhere and will do so within reason. For this reason a great number of localised stopping places have built up since the line was completed, many at the intersection of road crossings like this one. The crossings/halts usually take the name of the nearest farm, landmark or road as is the case here, but these unofficial halts never appear in timetable materials or have nameboards fitted to show their names. 
Queens Pier.
The stop here serves Queens Drive and other parts of Ramsey, and is the closest stop to the famous Queen's Pier, landmark of the town. At this point the line becomes inter-urban, running parallel to the roadway, notably featuring traction poles mounted at the side of the line, rather than between the running lines as is standard elsewhere.

USS Barataria (AVP-33)

The second USS "Barataria" (AVP-33) was a United States Navy "Barnegat"-class seaplane tender in commission from 1944 to 1946.
Construction, commissioning, and shakedown.
"Barataria" was laid down on 19 April 1943 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. She was launched on 2 October 1943, sponsored by Mrs. L. J. Stetcher, and commissioned at her builder's yard on 13 August 1944 with Commander Garrett S. Coleman in command.
After having spent the remainder of August 1944 in outfitting, loading supplies, and testing and calibrating equipment, "Barataria" conducted training in tending seaplanes under the auspices of Fleet Air Wing (FAW) 6 at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, at Oak Harbor, Washington. Concluding that training in early September 1944, the ship spent 10 September 1944 through 10 October 1944 in gunnery exercises, casualty drills, sonar training, a speed run, combat information center exercises, and in more seaplane tending operations. Upon completion of the shakedown, she returned to the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton, Washington, for post-shakedown availability and alterations.
World War II service.
Voyage to the Western Pacific.
Early in November 1944, "Barataria" stood out of Bremerton, bound for San Francisco, California, where she took on stores, aircraft maintenance spares, aviation gasoline, and supplies and embarked 39 officers as passengers. She then stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for Hawaii. Reaching Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 28 November 1944, she got underway again on 30 November 1944 and proceeded independently to Eniwetok, which she reached on 7 December 1944. After embarking passengers, "Barataria" continued again independently to Ulithi Atoll, where she arrived on 12 December 1944, and later fueled from the tanker "Octorance".
The Philippines campaign.
Departing from Ulithi as escort and lead ship of a five-ship convoy, "Barataria" reached the Philippines on 22 December 1944. She spent the remainder of December 1944 and the first few days of January 1945 anchored off Leyte in the San Juanico Strait tending Patrol Bomber Squadron (VPB) 25, consisting of 15 Martin PBM-3D Mariner flying boats, whose mission was to conduct daylight searches north and east of Luzon. Shifting to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 5 January 1945, "Barataria" got underway on 6 January 1945 as a screen for seaplane tender USS "Currituck" (AV-7) and rendezvoused with Task Force (TF) 79 carrying the San Fabian assault forces. Two aircraft rescue boats (ARBs) had been assigned to "Barataria", but one of these began taking on water and had to be abandoned and sunk on 8 January 1945. When several "kamikaze" suicide planes attacked the convoy later that day, "Barataria"s gunners claimed a "sure assist" for downing one.
On the morning of 9 January 1945, "Barataria", joined by "Currituck", left the convoy and proceeded to eastern Lingayen Gulf, where "Barataria" planted seaplane moorings, anchors, and buoys in the shallow waters south of Aringay Point. That afternoon, the planes of Patrol Bomber Squadron (VPB) 20 arrived and moored, and "Baritaria" carried out routine fueling operations for the remainder of the day. On the morning of 10 January 1945, "Barataria" surveyed the waters off the town of Damortis, south of Aringay Point, and found them free of swells. This information prompted her to move to that area, where she anchored shortly after noon. As the patrol bombers of Patrol Bomber Squadron (VPB) 17 arrived that afternoon, one plane sank after a rough landing. "Barataria" rescued the crew and salvaged some gear. When Japanese mortar fire began falling around the ship at 16:23 hours, "Barataria" slipped her anchor chain and retired out of range. Meanwhile, one of her 5-inch (127 mm) guns fired nine rounds at the Japanese positions, silencing the mortar fire. After that, "Baritaria" returned to the anchorage.
For the rest of January, "Barataria" tended the Consolidated PBY-5A Catalinas of Patrol Bomber Squadron (VPB) 71 as they carried out nighttime "Black Cat" strikes against shore installations and shipping along the coast of China and conducted antisubmarine patrol missions. Based first at Cabalitan Bay and then at Sual Bay in southwestern Lingayen GuIf, she shared these seaplane tender duties with "Currituck" until "Currituck" departed on 27 January 1945. "Barataria" then spent the entire month of February 1945 and the first two weeks of March 1945 back at Cabalitan Bay, establishing a seaplane ramp on the south shore of Cabalitan Island and continuing to tend the Catalinas of VPB 71 as they carried out night reconnaissance and attack missions. The PBM-3D Mariners of VPB 28 relieved VPB 71 on 28 February 1945 and continued the nocturnal missions begun by the PBYs.
Transferring the seaplane tending duties for VPB 28 to USS "Tangier" (AV-8) on 13 March 1945, "Barataria" stood out of Lingayen Gulf, bound via Subic Bay for Sangley Point, Luzon, and moored there on the morning of 18 March 1945. While at Sangley Point, "Barataria" serviced the planes of VPB 25, previously tended by USS "San Carlos" (AVP-51). The highlight of her service there began when she got underway at 11:16 hours on 26 March 1945 to rescue a VPB 28 plane downed in the South China Sea about off the coast of Luzon. Guided by search planes, "Barataria" arrived on the scene at 22:15 hours, lowered her motor whaleboat, and brought the plane crew on board while preparing to fuel the plane for a morning take off attempt or, that failing, to rig a tow. However, neither plan came to fruition. Instead, destroyer USS "Young" (DD-510), which ship arrived on the scene shortly after midnight to escort "Barataria", sank the plane with gunfire after all classified gear had been removed from it. "Barataria" then returned to Sangley Point where she spent the remainder of March 1945.
Underway again on 2 April 1945, "Barataria" headed for Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, to refuel and to replenish her supply of aviation gasoline, before proceeding to Cebu, where she anchored on 4 April 1944. Shifting to a berth off the city of Opon at Mactan Island on 5 April 1945, she there assumed the duties of station tender, Cebu. She surveyed Mactan Island for the establishment of a seaplane ramp and beach facilities, and laid out take off and landing areas in the waters offshore. She also established liaison with the United States Army Air Forces units ashore on both Mactan Island and Cebu. Meanwhile, the United States Army proceeded with the occupation of Cebu. With some isolated exceptions, the fighting centered on an area adjacent to Cebu City, with the “evident strong point being a high point, about three miles (5 km) north of the city” identified as “Hill 25.” Army Artillery Control contacted "Barataria" on 11 April 1945 and asked her to “fire on any available targets.” Directed by Army spotters, "Barataria" expended 100 5-inch (127 mm) rounds over the course of two hours early on 11 April 1945 and shelled Hill 25 again on 12 April 1945, this time sending 75 5-inch (127 mm) rounds into the Japanese position. The Army spotters pronounced her firing “excellent”. However, the action was not all one-sided for, at 05:40 hours on 14 April 1945, "Barataria" came under fire from Japanese 40- and 90-millimeter guns on Cebu Beach, directly opposite Mactan Island. Going to general quarters, she got underway and slipped her anchor cable, standing out of the north channel at 05:49 hours to lie to north of Mactan Island. She returned to her original anchorage later that morning, before moving to a berth in the southern part of Cebu Bay.
Relieved by seaplane tender USS "Heron" (AVP-2) on 21 April 1945, "Barataria" sailed for and anchored off Puerto Princessa, Palawan, on 22 April 1945. She then escorted seaplane tender USS "Pocomoke" (AV-9) to Tawi Tawi on 24 April 1945 and 25 April 1945, before proceeding on to Guiuan Harbor, Samar, late on the afternoon of 26 April 1945. After taking on board supplies there and fueling at San Pedro Bay, "Baratari"a sailed for Mindoro and anchored in Mangarin Bay on the evening of 3 May 1945.
Pushing on toward Lingayen Gulf, "Barataria" transferred aviation supplies to USS "Tangier" on 5 May 1945 before she relieved seaplane tender USS "Orca" (AVP-49) on station at noon on 8 May 1945. In so doing, "Barataria" assumed charge of six planes from VPB 28 engaged in Lingayen Bay-based air-sea rescue operations. For the remainder of May 1945 and all of June 1945, she tended the PBM-5D Mariners of VPB 28 as they carried out “Dumbo” missions covering the Army's 5th Air Force bombing strikes on Formosa. During May 1945, she also serviced the Royal Australian Air Force 76th Wing Detachment PBY Catalinas as an “intermediary landing point” in their minelaying operations off the China coast. Early in June 1945, "Barataria" provided air-sea rescue coverage for the movement of Marine Air Group 14 from Clark Field, Luzon, to Okinawa.
Underway for Puerto Princessa on 8 July 1945, "Barataria" briefly tended planes of VPB 25, on standby for antisubmarine patrols, before she continued on via Manila. where she took on cargo bound for Puerto Princessa. She conducted tending operations at Puerto Princessa from 15 July 1944 to 23 July 1944 before proceeding via Samar to Leyte. She next provided services for VPB 28 as it flew antisubmarine patrols out of Manila Bay, covering the waters adjacent to northern Luzon, for the remainder of World War II.
Honors and awards.
"Barataria" earned one battle star for her World War II operations.
Post-World War II Navy service.
With the end of the fighting on 15 August 1945 came new orders. "Barataria" cleared Subic Bay on 30 August 1945 bound for Okinawa. and arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 3 September 1945 after weathering a typhoon en route. After voyage repairs there, she shifted to Chimu Bay to tend the planes of VPB 17 and VPB 20 as they conducted passenger and mail flights. On 16 September 1945, another typhoon prompted "Barataria" to get underway to ride out the storm, getting all flyable planes aloft and off the rough seas. "Baritaria" clocked winds up to and seas up to 40 feet (12.2 m) high before she returned to port on 17 September 1945.
Underway for the coast of China on 24 September 1945, "Barataria" reached Shanghai on 27 September 1945 and, for the remainder of September, tended the planes of VPB 17, which were flying mail and passengers in and out of Shanghai. "Barataria" later performed seaplane tending operations out of Jinsen (now Incheon), Korea.
Decommissioning.
After completing her duties at Jinsen, "Barataria" returned to the United States for inactivation. She reached Seattle, Washington, on 29 December 1945. Decommissioned and placed in reserve on 24 July 1946, "Barataria" was laid up at Alameda, California.
United States Coast Guard service.
After more than two years of inactivity, "Barataria" was loaned to the United States Coast Guard on 17 September 1948. She became the Coast Guard cutter USCGC "Barataria" (WAVP-381). Later reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-381, "Barataria" was based at Portland, Maine, for most of her Coast Guard career. Her primary duty was to patrol ocean stations in the North Atlantic Ocean, reporting weather data and engaging in search-and-rescue and law-enforcement operations.
"Barataria" was stricken from the Navy List on 26 September 1966 and transferred outright to the Coast Guard on the same day. She served a tour in the Vietnam War in 1967-1968, then served on ocean stations in the Pacific Ocean.
The Coast Guard decommissioned "Barataria" in August 1969 and sold her for scrap in either September or October 1970 to N. W. Kennedy of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Georgia State University Library

The Georgia State University Library is an academic research library affiliated with Georgia State University. The Georgia State University Library has two primary locations, Library North and Library South. In addition to hundreds of thousands of pieces of print media, the library also has online databases for electronic articles, as well as an electronic catalog for looking up media within the library’s many floors. The media found in the library includes novels, journals, newspapers, government documents, archives, DVDs, CDs, video tapes, audio cassette tapes, and periodicals. The University Library is located in the middle of Georgia State's main campus near Gilmer St. and Courtland St.
Collections.
The library features over 1.5 million volumes which consist of 28,000 electronic journals, 2,800 periodicals over 820,000 government documents along with general texts. The Georgia State University Library includes 400 computer stations, 55 group study rooms, a quiet study room, and Saxbys Coffee Shop. The library is free and open to all Georgia State University Students, and costs $50 a year for the general public.
The library also allows access to the GALILEO network which connects students to a much larger network of journals, periodicals, magazines, etc. through a system of online sources.
History.
The Georgia State University Library, was established in 1948 as a branch of the University of Georgia Library. In 1951, the library purchased over 2,000 volumes from James Walter Mason. The original library staff only had three trained employees. After seven years of expansion, the library found a home in the second floor of Sparks Hall in 1955. The Sparks Hall facility contained a reading area and over 150,000 books. In comparison, the modern facility has its own building and is made up of multiple floors, and has more than ten times as much media as the Sparks Hall location had.
The present Assembly Hall (registration) area on the second floor of Sparks Hall became the library's home in 1955. The library traces its origins to a number of books that Dr. George Sparks donated from his personal collection to the Georgia Tech Evening School of Commerce in downtown Atlanta. Additional donations followed and included the commerce library of Professor Wayne S. Kell and a collection of city reports owned by former mayor James S. Key. The library soon required a building of its own to house its burgeoning collections. The first phase of construction resulted in a two-story building, which was completed in 1966. Three additional floors were added to the new library building during the second phase of construction in 1968. The building was completed in 1969, and the surrounding plaza was eventually landscaped.
Special Collections and Archives.
The Georgia State University Library also contains the Special Collections and Archives Department which collects and preserves rare historical materials in designated special subject areas. These are open to view by students and the public, but cannot be checked out. Unique records and artifacts in the trust of Special Collections Department & Archives, Georgia State University Library, may be loaned for the purpose of exhibit to educational and cultural institution.
Carl and Gretchen Patton Children's Collection.
Carl Patton, once the president of Georgia State, and his wife Gretchen donated a large collection of children's books to the Library's existing children's section on the fourth floor of library north in 2003. The collection consists of about 13,000 titles. "The Pattons’ gift represented an initial step toward raising $20 million to transform the main library into a 21st-century learning command central — a place where students routinely gather to conduct research, work on group projects, receive tutoring, study and socialize."

<doc id="20297308" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20297308" title="Motilon people">
Motilon people

The Motilone, or Bari are names of a Native American ethnic group, part of the Chibcha family, remnants of the Tairona Culture concentrated in northeastern Colombia and western Venezuela in the Catatumbo River basin, in the Colombian Department of Northern Santander in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. They have been the subject of the French ethnologist Robert Jaulin's attention, who redefined the concept of ethnocide by observing their particular fate.
Name.
Although the Bari and Yukpa peoples are commonly referred to as "Motilones," this is not how they refer to themselves. "Motilones" means "shaved heads" in Spanish, and is how Spanish-speaking Colombians refer to them.
History.
In the 16th century, Alonso de Ojeda of Spain sailed to Colombia and discovered the Maracaibo Basin. The Spaniards believed that the area's frequent lightning strikes turned stone into gold, and so they began settling the region extensively. The Motilones fought the Spaniards back from their territory, defeating five royal expeditions sent to pacify the Indians. It was the Spaniards who first named the Barí "Motilones," or "people of the short hair."
Later, a German company directed by Ambrosio Alfinger looted a large amount of gold from Caribe Indians on the western coast of South America, and attempted to transport the gold over the Bobalí Mountains. Motilones ambushed and destroyed the expedition, and the gold was lost, never to be found again. Motilone warriors harassed the troops of Simón Bolívar in the 19th century as he led them over the Orinoco plains and the Andes Mountains. 
In the 20th century, oil was discovered in Motilone territory, and as oil companies moved in, their land has been subjected to oil drilling from 1913–1926 and from 1996–2001. 
The first peaceful contact that was made with the Bari was by Roberto Lizarralde in 1960. Lizarralde conducted research among the Bari for 44 years and his research was carried on by his son, Manuel Lizarralde. The focus of their research has been on the ethnobotany of the Bari, who possess a vast knowledge of the biodiversity in Amazonia and use 80% of the plants around them.
The missionary Bruce Olson began living with the Bari in 1962, and became the blood brother of a chieftain's son. He's considered the most influential cause behind the "Motilone Miracle", of indigenously-run schools, literacy programs, medical clinics, as well as a concerted effort of the Motilone Bari to reach out with the person of Jesus Christ to 18 other surrounding tribes.
Since the initial contact in 1650, Bari land has been reduced to 7% of its original mass and the Bari have shifted their production to the gardening of cash crops in order to acquire Western goods which are becoming increasingly integrated into their culture.
Economy.
The Motilone people's chief economic activity is the growing of Theobroma cacao, the plant from which chocolate is made. They export the cacao and use the proceeds to help maintain their network of schools, community centers, and health clinics, all started after large numbers of the Motilones (notably the chieftain, "Bobby") received the Gospel. A transformation occurred in Motilone Bari culture; and as a result, clinics and schools were started in the Bari culture.
Language.
The Motilone speak the Barí language, part of the Chibchan language family.
Beliefs.
Current estimates are that 70% of the Motilone people are Christians.

Willem Arnold Alting

Willem Arnold Alting (11 November 1724 – 7 June 1800) was a Dutch colonial administrator who served as Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1780 to 1797.
Born in Groningen, Alting studied in his hometown and graduated in law. He left on 18 October 1750 for the East Indies on board the "De Middelburg" as an "onderkoopman" (underbuyer/undermerchant) for the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He spent the rest of his life in the Indies. In 1754 he became "koopman" (buyer/merchant) and in 1759 First Secretary to the government. In 1763 he became Counsellor-extraordinary ("Buitengewoon Raad") and in 1772 full Counsellor ("Raad ordinaris"). In 1777, he became First Counsellor ("Eerste Raad") was named Director-General. 
From March 1780 he was acting Governor-General, because of the sickness of his predecessor, Reynier de Klerck. Following the death of De Klerck, on 1 September 1780, he was chosen by the Dutch Council of the Indies as provisional Governor-General. He carried on this function for seventeen years.
De Klerck had wanted to bring the use of Dutch into the educational system, but Alting revoked this in 1786, so that Malay and Portuguese were once again used. Alting's term of office was marked by a steep decline of the Dutch East India Company and its power in the Indies. Three months after he took up post, the Netherlands went to war with Great Britain (in the 1780–1784 Fourth Anglo-Dutch War) and a great part of the territory of Dutch East India Company was occupied by the British. The government in Batavia (Jakarta) did not, on the whole, offer much resistance. Following the 1784 Peace of Paris, Britain obtained the right to unhindered trade in the East Indies. The Dutch had to cede Negapatam in India to the British. The image of the Dutch in the eyes of the local rulers was thoroughly shattered. 
From the Netherlands, three Commissioners-General were sent to work with Alting to reorganise. On the way there, one of them died and Alting managed to get his son-in-law Johannes Siberg to take his place. The Alting-Siberg duo dominated the Commission and, from the reports of one of the other Commissioners, it seems they worked very hard in their own interests. The Commission cost a lot of money but brought no improvement. In 1795, it became known in Batavia that their homeland (in the meantime having become the Batavian Republic) was once again at war with Great Britain.
On 17 February 1797, Willem Arnold Alting resigned as Governor-General and Commissioner-General and handed the post over to Pieter Gerardus van Overstraten. Alting remained as an ordinary citizen, without official position, living on his estate at Kampong Melajoe near Batavia. He died there on 7 June 1800.

Richard Llewellyn Williams

Richard Llewellyn Williams, (born December 28, 1929) was a career member of the Senior Foreign Service who, over three decades as a career U.S. diplomat, opened the first American consulate in mainland China since the 1940s (in Guangzhou, 1979), served as the first U.S. Ambassador to the Mongolian People's Republic from 1988 to 1990 (Diplomatic relations were established with the Mongolian People's Republic in January 1987) and then was named Consul General in Hong Kong from 1990 to 1993. Williams was also director of Chinese affairs at the U.S. State Department during the Tiananmen crisis.
Career.
Richard L. Williams was born in Chicago, IL in 1929. As a child, Williams was one of the kids on the radio program Quiz Kidsfrom 1940 to 1945. He graduated from the University of Chicago with an A.B.in 1948, then obtained his bachelor's degree from Purdue University in 1951. He went on to earn an M.B.A. from Harvard University in 1953 after which he served in the United States Army, from 1953 to 1955.
Williams joined the Foreign Service in 1956. From 1965 to 1967 he was detailed to the White House correspondence staff. From 1968 to 1972 he was a political officer at the Consulate General of the United States, Hong Kong. Between 1972 and 1975 he served as an international relations officer for the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. He was a country officer for Fiji and Papua New Guinea at the Department of State from 1975 to 1977; and then a student at the National War College from 1977 to 1978. In addition he was Deputy Director of the Office of Micronesian Status Negotiations (1978–1979), Consul General in Guangzhou (Canton) (1979–1981) (recounted in his 2005 memoir "At the Dawn of the New China" ), and Deputy Consul General in Hong Kong (1981–1985).
Williams was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to be the first U.S. Ambassador to the Mongolian People's Republic (MPR) on May 8, 1988. Bilateral relations with MPR had only been established a year earlier, in January 1987. Given the infrastructure challenges in Ulaanbaatar at the time, the State Department decided to accredit an Ambassador stationed in Washington. During this period Williams also served as Country Director of the Department of State's Office of Chinese and Mongolian Affairs during a particularly tense period in Sino-American relations following the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Instead of co-accrediting an ambassador from a usually larger neighboring country, as was standard practice when the State Department did not have the resources to establish a proper embassy in a particular country, the State Department decided to base Williams in Washington in order to avoid giving the Mongolians the impression that it considered them an adjunct of either Moscow or Beijing.
For seven years following his 1994 retirement from the Foreign Service, Williams taught graduate level China-related courses at Columbia and New York Universities.

Jimmy Fennig

Jimmy Fennig (born September 15, 1953 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) is a longtime NASCAR crew chief. He was the crew chief for Kurt Busch's 2004 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series' (now Sprint Cup Series) championships. Fennig has collected 34 Cup wins as crew chief. In 2013, he works for Carl Edwards at Roush Racing.
Biography.
Fennig raced asphalt and dirt cars in Wisconsin starting in 1970. He raced as a driver until joining the NASCAR Winston Cup Series (now Sprint Cup Series) in 1984 for DiGard Racing. Fennig moved to the American Speed Association (ASA) in 1985 for Mark Martin. In their two seasons together in ASA, the duo had 9 wins, 13 pole positions, and the 1986 championship.
Fennig returned to the Winston Cup Series as the crew chief for Bobby Allison at Stavola Brothers Racing in 1987. Earlier, Fennig had owned a car that Allison raced in Wisconsin and Michigan on Saturday nights. Allison won two races during their two years together, including the 1988 Daytona 500. The following season, he was paired with fellow Wisconsin racer Dick Trickle, who won the 1989 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award. 
Fennig continued to work with then-team owner Bobby Allison until Fennig left the team in October 1996 to join Roush Racing to become Martin's crew chief. Martin/Fennig had 4 wins in 1997, 24 Top 10s, and 3 poles to finish third in the points. Martin finished second in 1998 points with seven victories. They remained together for three more wins, until in they did not win in the 2001 NASCAR season. Jack Roush moved Fennig to the #97 crew to be the crew chief for young Kurt Busch in 2002, and Ben Leslie became the crew chief for Mark Martin. The swap was a success as Busch won the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series title in 2004. It was the first year of the Chase for the Cup. Busch dedicated his title to Fennig. Fennig was named the Sporting News crew chief of the year. He continued in that role until 2006. He started out the season as Jamie McMurray's crew chief, and he became the head of Roush Racing Busch Series effort. Fennig became the crew chief for David Ragan after Ragan replaced Martin in the #6 car in 2007, and he remained in that role for 2008.
For the 2013 season, Fenning replaced Chad Norris as crew chief for Carl Edwards. The pair won in their second race together, at Phoenix International Raceway.
Jack Roush, owner of Roush Racing, talked about Fennig: "Jimmy Fennig is an unsung hero at Roush Racing. He doesn't do things that create a personal image away from the driver or away from the sponsor or away from the team. He's the trooper that's back there doing everything that he can everyday."

BrewDog

BrewDog is a Scottish brewery located in Ellon, Aberdeenshire.
History.
BrewDog claims to be Scotland's largest independently-owned brewery producing about 120,000 bottles per month for export all over the world. It was founded in 2007 by James Watt and Martin Dickie. The brewery at the Kessock Industrial Estate in Fraserburgh produced its first brew in April 2007. The company moved premises to nearby Ellon in 2012, and the Fraserburgh site will be used as a brewing laboratory for experimental beers.
On September 2013 a TV show titled "Brew Dogs" premiered on the US television channel, Esquire Network where James and Martin travel across America visiting different American beer towns, celebrating distinctive craft beers and creating their own locally-inspired brews.
Beers.
The bottled beers are distributed to British supermarkets and are exported worldwide to countries including Ireland, Japan, Taiwan, Austria, Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands, the United States, Canada, Australia and Singapore (TSA Wines). The kegs are available in locations throughout the UK and Ireland, and in a selection of countries around the world.
Prior to 2012, most of their beers were available as cask ale, but cask production was phased out.
BrewDog's core range of beers include:
Other BrewDog beers have included:
The Abstrakt series of experimental beers. Known only by their AB: number designation and released in limited quantities:
In 2009, Tokyo* caused controversy when UK watchdog the Portman Group criticised the availability of a beer of that strength in 330ml bottles with traditional crown corks. Since then BrewDog has produced progressively stronger beers of very high strength, and has laid claim to the title 'strongest beer ever brewed' on more than one occasion.
Late in November 2009, BrewDog launched a beer called Tactical Nuclear Penguin, with 32% alcohol, which was claimed to be the strongest beer ever made.
In February 2010 BrewDog announced Sink The Bismarck, an apparent 41% ABV to reclaim the World's Strongest Beer title from Schorschbräu, who had produced a 40% ABV version of their Schorschbock.
In July 2010, BrewDog produced a 55% ABV freeze-distilled beer called The End of History, with the bottles packaged in small stuffed animals, priced at £500 and £700 each. Only 12 bottles were produced; 11 for retail sale, with the other one going to Internet video blog BeerTapTV. BrewDog claim that this set new records not only for alcoholic strength in a beer, but also for price. "Advocates for Animals" called the gimmick 'perverse'. The title "strongest beer of the world" then fell back to Mr Tscheuschner from the Schorschbräu brewery in Germany, whose Schorschbock 57 boasts an ABV of 57.5%.
The title for world's strongest beer has since changed again though. It is now Brewmeister's Snake Venom at 67.5%.
Bars.
In October 2010 BrewDog opened their first bar in nearby Aberdeen, named "BrewDog Aberdeen". A second bar, "BrewDog Edinburgh", opened in March 2011 located on Cowgate with a third in Glasgow opening in July. "BrewDog Camden" opened in December 2011, followed by "BrewDog Nottingham" in the Lace Market which opened in February 2012. Soon after "BrewDog Newcastle" opened on 13 April with a BrewDog bar opening in Manchester on 4 May and in Bristol at the end of October. In December 2012 a further site launched in Birmingham. 2013 saw only 3 bars open. Leeds finally opened in March following a 9 month licensing battle. The first international bar for BrewDog opened in Stockholm in May, and at the end of November, the largest bar BrewDog have with 40 taps of different beer opened in Shepherd's Bush, London.
On the 22nd January 2014, BrewDog open the doors to their latest international bar in São Paulo, Brazil. 
Awards.
BrewDog won the 2008 Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust Young Entrepreneur of the Year award.
Paradox Grain won a Gold Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup in the Wood and Barrel-aged Strong Beer Category.
BrewDog won the Tenon Entrepreneur of the Year Award for demonstrating exceptional vision and leadership at the 2008 National Business Awards for Scotland.
The Physics won World's Best Strong Pale Ale (Sub Category Winner) and Rip Tide won World's Best Imperial Stout (Style Trophy Winner) at the 2007 World Beer Awards, an annual competition organised by "Beers of the World" magazine.
Hardcore IPA won Gold at the 2010 World Beer Cup in the Imperial IPA category.
On 9 May 2012 BrewDog revealed that Diageo had threatened to withdraw funding from BII Scotland's annual awards if BrewDog was named winner of the Best Bar Operator award. Diageo later apologized to BrewDog for what they called a "serious misjudgement by Diagio staff".
Marketing.
BrewDog's provocative marketing has been a key aspect of the business, and has gained them substantial international coverage.
In 2008 BrewDog were challenged by UK drinks industry watchdog the Portman Group. Portman had claimed BrewDog to be in breach of their Code of Practice. BrewDog denied these allegations and countered that Portman was impeding the development of smaller brewing companies. After an 8-month long dispute and a preliminary adjudication which had ruled against the company, in December 2008 BrewDog were cleared of all breaches of the Code of Practice and were permitted to continue marketing their brands without making any changes to the packaging. In protest to their targeting, BrewDog introduced "Speedball", saying ""...we thought we would give them something worth banning us for..."" . Speedball was promptly banned by Portman before being renamed as Dogma.
BrewDog were also described as ""...one of the prime movers..."" behind the campaign which changed the law in 2011 to allow new beer measures in Britain.

2009 Campeonato Gaúcho

The 89th season of the Campeonato Gaúcho kicked off on January 20 and ended on April 19. Repeating the 2008 final score, Internacional clinched their 39th title – second consecutive – after beating Caxias 8–1 in the "Taça Fábio Koff" final. As Internacional had already won "Taça Fernando Carvalho", beating city rivals Grêmio 2–1 in the final, Campeonato Gaúcho finals were unnecessary.
The competition had 16 clubs divided into two groups. In the first part, called "Taça Fernando Carvalho" teams from one group played against teams from the other group. In the second part, called "Taça Fábio Koff", clubs played inside their group. On both parts, top four teams from each group qualified to play-offs, when every round was decided in a single game. Winners of each part were supposed to play finals, but as Internacional won both, they were declared champions without it.
System.
The 16 clubs will be divided into two groups.
Group 1: Internacional, Juventude, Avenida, Esportivo, Veranópolis, Brasil and Internacional (SM);
Group 2: Grêmio, Caxias, Santa Cruz, Ypiranga, Ulbra, Sapucaiense, São José and São Luiz.
The tournament will be divided in two stages. In the first one, called "Taça Fernando Carvalho" (Fernando Carvalho Cup, in reference to former Internacional chairman, winner of the 2006 Copa Libertadores and FIFA Club World Cup), teams from one group will play in single round-robin format against clubs of the other group. Top four teams in each group advance to quarterfinals. In home-and-away system, winners qualify to semifinals and then, to the finals. Later, in "Taça Fábio Koff" (Fábio Koff Cup, in reference to former Grêmio chairman, winner of the 1983 Intercontinental Cup, 1983 and 1995 Copa Libertadores), teams in the same group will play each other once. Again, top four teams will play quarterfinals, winners play semifinals and then finals. If the same club wins both stages, they will be declared champions. Otherwise, a final will be disputed in home-and-away system.
Background.
On January 15, just one week before its debut in the championship, a bus carrying all Brasil squad crashed in the 150th kilometer of the BR-392 road, in the city of Canguçu, southern Rio Grande do Sul. The team was heading back to Pelotas after beating Santa Cruz 2–1 in a friendly match played in Vale do Sol, near Santa Cruz do Sul. The bus plunged off a 130-foot ravine after the driver lost its control when approaching a turn. The accident caused the death of three members of the team: goalkeeper trainer Giovani Guimarães, defender Régis Gouveia and striker Claudio Milar. Milar is considered to be one of the most notable players in the history of the club, scoring 110 goals in approximately 200 caps. Several other players sustained injuries. Among the injured was Copa Libertadores 1995 winner and 1996 Olympic bronze-medalist Danrlei.
After the disaster, several clubs offered to loan players for free in order to help Brasil to play in the tournament. Also, companies as Multisom and Banrisul signed special sponsorship deals to provide financial support. On January 19, club managers and the Rio Grande do Sul Football Federation decided that Brasil should skip their first 5 matches, debuting on February 3 against Santa Cruz.

The healthcare system of New Zealand has undergone significant changes throughout the past several decades. From an essentially fully public system in the early 20th century, reforms have introduced market and health insurance elements primarily in the last three decades, creating a mixed public-private system for delivering healthcare. 
In 2005, New Zealand spent 8.9% of GDP on health care, or US$2,403 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure. In a 2010 study, New Zealand came last in a study for the level of medications use in 14 developed countries (i.e. used least medicines overall), and also spent the lowest amount on healthcare amongst the same list of countries, with US$2510 ($3460) per capita, compared to the United States at US$7290.
Structure.
The Ministry of Health is responsible for the oversight and funding of the twenty District Health Boards (DHBs). These are responsible for organizing healthcare in the district and meeting the standards set by the Ministry of Health. Twenty-one DHBs came into being on January 1, 2001 with Southland and Otago DHBs merging into Southern DHB on 1 May 2010.
The boards for each DHB are elected in elections held every three years, with the exception of one of the eight board members, who is appointed by the Ministry of Health.
The DHBs oversee the forty six Primary Health Organizations established throughout the country. These were first set up in July, 2002, with a mandate to focus on the health of communities. Originally there were 81 of these, but this has been reduced down to 46 in 2008. They are funded by DHBs, and are required to be entirely non-profit, democratic bodies that are responsive to their communities' needs. Almost all New Zealanders are enrolled in a PHO, as there are financial incentives for the patients to become enrolled.
Public vs. private payment.
The burden for the core of the healthcare system rests with government expenditure (approx. 77%). Private payment by individuals also plays an important role in the overall system although the cost of these payments are comparatively minor. 
Damage as a result of "accidents", ranging from minor to major physical and psychological trauma, is generally completely covered by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). This may include coverage for doctors visits and lump-sum payments. 
Those earning less than certain amounts, depending on the number of dependents in their household, can qualify for a Community Services Card (CSC), which reduces the upfront fee for visiting a doctor.
Hospital and specialist care, on the other hand, is totally covered by the government if the patient is referred by a general or family practitioner.
Health statistics.
The following statistics are a sample from the World Health Organization Statistical Information System (WHOSIS). The year on which the data were sampled follows the statistic in brackets.
Abortion.
Abortion is legal in New Zealand, if certain criteria are met. In general, either the health of the mother or the foetus must be in jeopardy. Additionally, two doctors must give their consent to the procedure. There were 18,380 abortions carried out in 2007, following a general increase in both the absolute number and per capita rate since 1991.
Medications.
The Pharmaceutical Management Agency of New Zealand (PHARMAC) was set up in 1993 to decide which medications the government will subsidise. In general, PHARMAC will select an effective and safe medication from a class of drugs, and negotiate with the drug manufacturer to obtain the best price. There are approximately 2,000 drugs listed on the national schedule that are either fully or partially subsidised.
Emergency service.
Outside the Wellington Region, Emergency and non-urgent ambulance transportation is carried out by the charitable organization St. John New Zealand. In Greater Wellington Region ambulance services are provided by the Wellington Free Ambulance organisation.

Yarn weight

Yarn weight refers to the thickness of yarn used by knitters, weavers, crocheters and other fiber artists. Changing yarn weight or needle size can have a significant impact on the finished project, so standardized systems have been spread about, as well as conversion systems for regional standards (especially needle sizes).Yarn weight is important in achieving the correct gauge or tension for a particular project and can help with yarn substitution. The Craft Yarn Council of America has developed a system that seeks to standardize the labeled weights of yarn. Most yarns state their weight on the ball band. Some brands use a standardized numbering system that uses 7 ranges of relative thickness of yarn.
One way of determining the weight of an unknown yarn is to use the wrapping method.
Wrap the yarn around a large needle or a ruler. Make sure the yarn lies flat. Push the yarn together so there are no gaps between wraps. Smooth it out so it is neither too loose nor too tight. Measure the number of wraps per inch (2.5 cm). For better accuracy, measure the wraps at the centre of your yarn sample.
Different terminology is used in different countries:
Fabric.
The following equation may be used to determine the weight of warp and weft required for a particular fabric:
If there are two colors in the warp, use the following equations:
If the counts of two warps are the same:
or
If there are two colors in the weft:
or
