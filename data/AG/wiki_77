Great Fire of 1922

The Great Fire of 1922 was a wildfire burning through the Lesser Clay Belt in the Timiskaming District, Ontario, Canada, from October 4 to 5, 1922. It has been called one of the ten worst natural disasters in Canadian history.
The preceding summer had been unusually hot and dry. Fire rangers, anticipating the upcoming "burn" season, had requested to stay in the area but were not granted permission. They left at the end of the fire season in mid September, leaving the area without fire protection services. In the fall when burning permits were no longer required, farmers and settlers started to set small brush fires to clear the land. Dry conditions had persisted past the usual "burn" season and on October 4, the wind turned into hurricane-force gales, fanning the flames out of control and combining the brush fires into one large inferno.
Over two days, the fire consumed an area of , affecting 18 townships in Ontario. It completely destroyed the communities of North Cobalt, Charlton, Thornloe, Heaslip, and numerous smaller settlements. Englehart and New Liskeard were partly burnt. In all 43 people died. In Quebec, the communities of Notre-Dame-du-Nord and neighbouring Notre-Dame-des-Quinze were also devastated. The fires were extinguished when the winds abated and rain and snow began to fall on October 5, 1922.
One of the towns hit hardest was Haileybury which burnt down within 3 to 6 hours. Thick smoke caused panic and confusion. The town's residents were forced to take refuge in the cold waters of Lake Timiskaming and cover themselves with wet blankets. The fire destroyed over 90% of the town, killing 11 residents, leaving 3500 people homeless, and causing $2 million of damage.
The people of Charlton took refuge in the power house; a baby was even born there that night. The Power House later burned while being used for grain grinding. It was later rebuilt and a plaque was placed to commemorate the fire. An area of 246,000 hectares was destroyed in the fire.
Hardships remained for the survivors, who had lost all their belongings and faced the approaching winter. Consequently a large emergency relief program was organized for the affected area. Furthermore, the fire had consumed all the nearby forests, causing a severe shortage of firewood and forcing people for many years to travel far in order to obtain it.

St. Nicholas Houses

St. Nicholas Houses is a public housing project in Central Harlem, in the borough of Manhattan, New York City. The project is located between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, spanning a superblock from 127th Street to 131st Street. The project consists of thirteen 14-story buildings containing 1,523 apartment units. 
St. Nicholas Houses, often called "St. Nick," were built in 1954 under the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Act of 1949. When the houses initially began seeking applicants, World War II veterans received priority. The buildings are managed by the New York City Housing Authority.
The site formerly consisted of city blocks with small attached homes in poor condition, and existing residents were removed via a slum clearance program.

Jack Breedon

John "Jack" Norman Breedon (29 December 1907 – 12 December 1967) was an English footballer and manager. He played as a goalkeeper. Breedon was born in South Hiendley in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and played for Barnsley, Sheffield Wednesday, Manchester United and Burnley. He also appeared as a wartime guest for Bolton Wanderers, Manchester City, and Rochdale during the Second World War. After retiring from playing in 1946, Breedon had spells as manager at both Halifax Town and Bradford (Park Avenue).
Playing career.
Breedon worked as a miner while playing amateur football for his village club in South Hiendley before turning professional when he signed for Football League Second Division side Barnsley in September 1928. After making eight league appearances in just over two seasons at Oakwell, he transferred to First Division outfit Sheffield Wednesday in November 1930. Breedon never established himself as first-choice goalkeeper during his time with the Hillsborough club and was predominantly a backup to England international Jack Brown. In total, he played 45 league matches for Wednesday in five seasons before moving to Manchester United in the summer of 1935.
Breedon made his debut for Manchester United in the 1–3 defeat away at Plymouth Argyle on the opening day of the 1935–36 campaign. He was dropped for the following match in favour of Jack Hall, who went on to keep his place for most of the remaining season as the team were crowned Second Division champions. Following the departure of Hall in 1936, Breedon was unable to capitalise as new signing Tommy Breen was installed as first-choice goalkeeper. Breedon made 13 league appearances in total during his first three years at Old Trafford, but became more involved in the first team during the 1938–39 season as United achieved a 14th-place finish in the First Division. He had retained his place in the side for the beginning of the following campaign, appearing in the opening three games, but the season was abandoned following the outbreak of the Second World War and the records were expunged.
During the war Breedon assisted several teams as a wartime guest player, including Rochdale, Manchester City and Bolton Wanderers. He also played regularly for Manchester United in wartime competitions, but left the club in October 1945 following the emergence of young goalkeeper Jack Crompton. He subsequently signed for Burnley and made his debut for the Turf Moor side in the 2–1 FA Cup win over Stoke City on 7 January 1946. However, it proved to be his only appearance for Burnley as he was unable to dislodge fellow new signing Jimmy Strong from the starting line-up. Strong went on to become first-choice for the next eight years, playing more than 280 matches for the club. Breedon was released by Burnley in May 1946 and retired from professional football aged 38.
Coaching career.
Following his retirement from playing, Breedon was offered the manager's job at New Brighton but declined the position. In August 1947, he was appointed manager of Third Division North club Halifax Town to replace James Thompson. He spent three years in charge of the Yorkshire side; during this time the team never finished higher than 19th in the division. After leaving Halifax in 1950, Breedon worked as a scout for Bradford City for several years. He was appointed manager of rivals Bradford (Park Avenue) in January 1955 but his tenure was brief and he left the club nine months later. This proved to be Breedon's last managerial post as he ended his career with a spell as a scout for Leeds United.

Turya-class torpedo boat

The Turya class is the NATO reporting name for a class of hydrofoil torpedo boats built for the Soviet Navy and Soviet allies. The Soviet designation was "Project 206M".
Design.
The "Turya" class is a derivative of the "Shershen" class torpedo boat. A hydroplane was added forward to increase speed. These boats can operate at 40 knots at Sea State 4 and 35 knots at Sea State 5. A heavier twin 57 mm gun was added aft in response to NATO fast attack craft being fitted with the 76 mm OTO Melara gun. The boats are fitted with a helicopter type dipping sonar aft. The 533mm (21 inch) torpedo tubes can fire either anti-ship or anti-submarine torpedoes. Export boats were not fitted with dipping sonar.
Ships.

GTO Records

GTO Records is a British Record label which released many hits during the 1970s. It ran from 1974 to 1981 and mainly concentrated on pop music and disco.
Background.
The record label was founded by Laurence Myers in 1974, after he had set up GTO Films and Arcade Records over the past two years. The label signed mainly pop and disco acts such as Billy Ocean, The Dooleys, Heatwave and released Donna Summer's records in the UK, all of which proved to be successful. The biggest hit released by the label was Donna Summer's "I Feel Love", which reached No.1 in 1977.
In 1978, the label was sold to CBS Records after achieving a high level of hits for a new label.

Jack Hacking

John "Jack" Hacking (22 December 1897 – 31 May 1955) was an English footballer. His regular position was as a goalkeeper. He was born in Blackburn. He played for Blackpool, Fleetwood Town, Oldham Athletic, Manchester United, and Accrington Stanley.
Domestic career.
Blackpool.
Hacking made his debut for Bill Norman's Blackpool on 24 September 1921, in a 2–0 defeat at Hull City. He was the third goalkeeper Blackpool had used in their first seven league games. He remained in goal for the following five games, all of which Blackpool lost.
With Harry Mingay being Blackpool's first-choice goalkeeper, Hacking didn't start again for "the Seasiders" until 6 February 1924, under a new manager, Frank Buckley, in a single-goal victory over Manchester United at Bloomfield Road. He went on to appear in the remaining fifteen games of their league campaign, helping them to a fourth-placed finish in Division Two.
Hacking started the first three league games of the 1924–25 season, before being replaced for five games by Algy Wilkinson. He returned for seven games, but another goalkeeper, Len Crompton, took over for 26 of the remaining 27 league games. Hacking returned for a 1–0 defeat at Bradford City on 14 April. It was his final appearance for Blackpool.
Oldham Athletic.
After a season at non-league Fleetwood which finished with a win in the Lancashire Combination Cup Final, Hacking signed for Second Division Oldham Athletic together with close friend and Fleetwood teammate Billy Porter. He went on to make 223 appearances for the club over the next eight seasons, during which he proved to be a model of consistency, being rarely absent from the team. One short spell of absence came at Easter 1930 when the club were candidates for promotion back to Division One, which they had left seven years earlier. With Hacking down with flu, they picked up just one point out of three games, losing home and away to Blackpool, who were promoted with Chelsea at the end of the season, with the Oldham club just two points behind. His three England caps in the 1928-1929 season, against Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make him Oldham's most capped England international. 
He was transferred to Manchester United in March 1934, but eighteen months later as player/manager of Accrington Stanley, he showed his appreciation for his long service at Oldham when he chose to play his final league game in December 1935 at Boundary Park.
Manchester United.
When Hacking joined Manchester United in March 1934, they were struggling to avoid relegation to Division Three, with their fate in doubt until the last game of the season, when opponents Millwall needed just one point from the game to avoid the drop. Hacking kept a clean sheet as United won 2-0. He moved to Accrington Stanley as player manager at the end of the 1934-35 season, but ten years later made a very unusual last appearance for United, when his son, Jack junior, who was also a goalkeeper, was appearing as a wartime guest player. In the 1945-46 season Hacking deputised for Jack junior when he was unfit to play, and at the age of 47 became the oldest player to appear in a league match that season.
Accrington Stanley.
At Accrington Stanley, he became player/manager and was the Barrow secretary/manager from May 1949 until his death.
International career.
His three appearances for England in 1928–29 came against Northern Ireland on 22 October 1928 (won 2–1), Wales on 17 November 1928 (won 3–2) and Scotland on 13 April 1929 (lost 0–1). As a result, England finished runners-up in the 1929 British Home Championship.

Friedrich Beust

Friedrich (von) Beust (August 9, 1817 – December 6, 1899), German soldier and political activist and Swiss reform pedagogue, was the son of Prussian Major Karl Alexander von Beust. Beust was born in the Odenwald, in whose great forests, as a young man, he observed Nature in her large and small aspects and collected her creatures. He learned to ride a horse in the royal stables. In 1834, he became an ensign in the 17th Prussian regiment. Under the guidance of a captain, he drew maps in his free time. He entered the division school at Düsseldorf where he was especially interested in geography, which students of Carl Ritter were teaching. He continued his studies of cartography and also science, especially anatomy. In 1845, he was ordered to Fortress Minden, where he came to the conclusion he could not fit into Prussian military discipline, bitterly resigned in 1848, and became a political activist.
In 1848 he was delegate from the Cologne Workers' Association to the Second Democratic Congress held in Berlin. At the Congress he spoke in favour of the "Demands of the Communist Party in Germany" which were written by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. This was the Communist League's political programme for the revolution.
Beust took over the operations of the republican "Neuen Kölnischen Zeitung" when the previous publisher, Friedrich Annecke, was arrested for reporting on the Frankfurt Democratic Congress. Despite the efforts of Annecke's wife, Mathilde Franziska ("née" Giesler), the newspaper was suppressed. He got to know Ferdinand Freiligrath who was helping Frau Annecke put out the "Westfälischen Jahrbuch", and who, anticipating the coming emigration which would be necessary, wrote him some letters of introduction to people in Paris. He also got to know the social democrat Karl Marx, who was putting out the "Neuer Rheinischer Zeitung" with Freiligrath. He took over the command of the Cologne militia, and when it interfered with the departure of Prussian troops to Düsseldorf to dissolve a regiment there, a state of siege — Belagerungszustand — was declared for Cologne and Beust's arrest was sought for high treason. At that point he emigrated to Paris. Later he was elected to the military commission for the Baden-Palatinate uprising. Beust soon saw that the chaotic leadership, among other things, would not allow the uprising to accomplish anything useful, and after the Ubstadt und Waghäusel battle, lost through ineptitude, he fled with a detachment across the Swiss border at Rheinfelden on June 15.
Beust settled in Zürich where he learned the trade of a pedagogue with the innovative teacher Meier while studying botany and chemistry at the university. He obtained an appointment at Karl (nephew of the famous Friedrich) Fröbel's school. Until 1850 another of the teachers at the school was Wilhelm Liebknecht, the Marxist founder of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany. 
At this point, he stopped using "von" when he gave his name, but he never formally renounced his claims to nobility. Seeing a return to Germany was out of the question, he joined A. Kirchner in the leadership of his establishment. In 1854 he married Anna Lipka a cousin of Friedrich Engels.
Then he founded his own school, and for the rest of his life devoted all his resources to that, and became a Swiss citizen. The school taught 25 children, and was attended by children living in Zürich and those of well-situated families in Germany. Among them was Ferdinand Fröbel, a grandson of Theodor a brother of Karl Fröbel. Emilie Michaelis, a leader of the Fröbel movement in England said of the school that it was a, 'truly remarkable institution' adding, after referring to Fröbel and Pestalozzi, that, 'this school stands alone in its complete fulfilment of these great educationists' 
Beust remained active in socialist politics joining the International Workingmen's Association which became known as the First International in 1886. In 1894, Beust's son, Dr. Fritz von Beust (1856-1908), took over its direction. Beust was especially interested in the teachings of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Fröbel on activities for children, and himself published works on early childhood education.
When he died, he was one of the last of the “48ers” living in exile.

Shaikh Inayat Allah Kamboh

Shaikh Inayat-Allah Kamboh (1608–1671) was a scholar, writer and historian. He was son of Mir Abdu-lla, "Mushkin Kalam", whose title shows him to also have been a fine writer. Shaikh Inayat-Allah Kamboh was elder brother and teacher of Muhammad Saleh Kamboh Salafi, the famous historian of Shah Jahan's court and teacher of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. He died in 1671 AD at Delhi, and his Maqbara is located in Guband Kambohan wala on Empress Road near Railways Headquarter, Lahore.
Inayat-Allah Kamboh spent his early life in the military service of the Mughals and was a "Mir Munshi" ("Inspector General") of Shah Jahan and held a mansab of 800 horses. "But he after a period of service, he retired from the world and lived besides the sacred shrine of Qutb-ud-Din Bakhtiyar Kaki at Delhi". Like his brother Muhammad Saleh, Inayat-Allah is also stated to be an accomplished Hindi singer 
Inayat-Allah Kamboh wrote several historical works. He is most famous for his collection of tales entitled "Bahar-i-Danish" (Springtime of Knowledge), completed in 1651 AD, which became one of the most popular textbooks of Persian. Historian Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, younger brother of Inayat-Allah Kamboh, praised "Bahar-i-Danish" as a model of sophisticated workmanship. It became part of the syllabuses of Persian schools and is mentioned in a manuscript-copy of "Khulasatul Makatib", written in 1688. From its popular use in Persian schools, educated men and women, both Muslims and Hindus, were commonly acquainted with it in Mughal India. During British rule too, according to education reports, it was taught in nearly all schools and its "style and idiom" were "regarded as the best models of composition" (Reid 1852: 54). 
His another important work of Kamboh is the "Takmilah-yi-Akbar-Namah" which is a continuation of Abu-al-Fazl’s "Akbar-Namah" and narrates the last four years of emperor Akbar’s reign. He also wrote two more books known as "Dalkasha" and "Asharaf-al-Sarayaf".

Chastity (soundtrack)

Chastity is the first soundtrack album by American singer-actress Cher, released on June 1969 by Atco. It was released to promote and accompany the 1969 motion picture, "Chastity." The album, like the film from which it came, was a commercial failure.
Album information.
The "Chastity" album was released in the summer of 1969, the same date as Cher's album "3614 Jackson Highway," and was produced by Sonny Bono. The soundtrack is largely instrumental, with vocals by Cher on the track "Chastity's Song (Band of Thieves)" -- a song written and recorded by Elyse Weinberg. This song was also released as a single, with "I Walk on Guilded Splinters" as the B-side.

Goopy Geer (film)

Goopy Geer is a 1932 Merrie Melodies cartoon short, featuring the first appearance of the title character.
Synopsis.
The customers in a nightclub clamor for Goopy Geer, who then comes out on the stage and entertains them by playing the piano, first with his fingers and his ears, later with his animated gloves. He's soon accompanied by a girl who tells a joke and sings a song.
Meanwhile, the customers eat and carry on in slapstick ways, and two coat racks dance together.
Toward the end, a drunken horse breathes fire and destroys the piano, but Goopy keeps right on playing.
Censorship.
On Cartoon Network's former late night program called Late Night Black and White, an early scene of the gorilla waiter dancing and saying "Yes, sir! Yes, sir!" was removed. The other scenes with the gorilla were left intact.

Herbert Birchenough (21 September 1874 – 28 February 1942) was an English football goalkeeper. He played 167 league games in the Football League for Burslem Port Vale, Glossop, and Manchester United between 1898 and 1903.
Playing career.
Birchenough was born in Haslington, Cheshire, and played for non-league sides Haslington, Crewe Hornets, Nantwich, Sandbach St.Mary's, and Audley, before joining Burslem Port Vale in October 1897. He kept a clean sheet on his debut, on 6 November 1897 in a 4–0 home win over Ilkeston Town. He quickly established himself as the number 1 keeper and helped the team win the Staffordshire Senior Cup in 1898. Vale moved from the Midland Football League into the Football League Second Division in 1898–99, and Birchenough's goalkeeping heroics in the FA Cup win over Sheffield United were a major part of the club's success in regaining their Football League status. He was a virtual ever-present at the Athletic Ground. After 24 league and cup appearances in 1899–1900 he was sold to Glossop in January 1900 for £250 to ease Vale's financial difficulties. The "Hillmen" finished bottom of the First Division in 1900, and finished fifth and eighth in the Second Division in the 1900–01 and 1901–02 seasons respectively. He then moved on to Manchester United, and kept goal in 25 league and five FA Cup games in the 1902–03 campaign, after making his debut in a 1–0 win over Arsenal on 25 October. He later played for Crewe Alexandra in the Birmingham & District League.

Lambda Muscae

Lambda Muscae (λ Mus, λ Muscae), often catalogued HD 102249 or HIP 57363, is the fourth brightest star in the southern hemisphere constellation of Musca (the Fly). Lambda Muscae visibly makes up the far end of the tail of the visual Musca constellation. It is a star in a dual system according to studies, and one of the stars catalogued in astronomer Johann Bayer's 1603 publications "Uranometria". Lambda Muscae more recently has been recorded as having a stellar classification of A7III. Thus, Lambda Muscae has a white tint and burns significantly hotter than our own sun.
Distance and visibility.
Based on research done by the European Space Agency for the Hipparcos Star Catalogue, Lambda Muscae exhibits a parallax of 25.42 milliarcseconds. With this data it can be calculated that Lambda Muscae is situated at a distance of 39.3 parsecs, or 128.0 light years, away from the sun.
Lambda Muscae is a star of the third magnitude (or 3.68(v) to be exact) when viewed from the Earth, and is visible to the naked eye in regions that lack dense light pollution.
Lambda Muscae is the farthest right star in the visual constellation of Musca and is thus the tail of the fly.
Stellar characteristics.
Lambda Muscae has a listed spectral type of A7V. The A7 portion of this designation that Lambda Muscae is a class A7 star, meaning the light it emits is bluish-white in color and burns at a temperature significantly hotter than our own sun (Sol), which is a G2 star. A7 stars are on the larger end of the Harvard spectral classification list, being only smaller and dimmer than Class-O and Class-B stars.

Claudia Moore

Claudia Moore (born April 14, 1953 in Buffalo, New York) is a dancer and choreographer who resides in Toronto, Canada. She is the artistic director of MOonhORsE dance theatre. Claudia Moore has been creating and performing movement for theatre, film, multi-disciplinary collaboration and her own dance theatre productions since the late 1970s. 
Recent works include "Ever thus" (2006), "By night" (2004), "Casa" (2003), "On earth" (2002) and "Small midnight" (2001), co-choreographed by Moore and Tedd Robinson. "Box pieces", her first dance film, was commissioned by director Paul Carrière from Canada’s Bravo! art channel. Claudia’s work has been presented in Montreal, Vancouver, Halifax, Peterborough, Buffalo and New York. Claudia also choreographed the film "Exotica" by Atom Egoyan.
The dancer.
Moore began ballet class with Stella Appelbaum at the Dance Arts Studio in Buffalo and fell in love with dancing. At age twelve, she became a student at the National Ballet School in Toronto. She began performing with the National Ballet of Canada at sixteen years old, touring Europe and the United States from 1971 to 1973. Her curiosity led her beyond classical ballet. She joined the Felix Blaska Company in France in 1973 and studied physical theatre with Lindsay Kemp in London. Returning to Canada, Claudia danced with the Contemporary Dance Theatre of Montreal. In 1976 she joined the Toronto Dance Theatre and in 1980, became a founding member of Desrosiers Dance Theatre, performing major roles with those companies until 1987. She performed on video and on film, including "L'Oiseau de Feu" for CBC Montreal and Leonard Cohen's "I am a Hotel". 
She also performed original works by Canadian choreographers including Serge Bennathan, Peter Chin, Ginette Laurin, James Kudelka, Lola MacLaughlin and Tedd Robinson.
The choreographer.
She choreographed her first work, "Chrysalis", in 1977 in a workshop at Toronto Dance Theatre. Since that time, she has created more than forty works, which have been performed in Paris, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.
Her work is character-driven and displays a personal style of dance-theatre, influenced by her studies with physical theatre artists Lindsay Kemp, Yoshi Oida and Philippe Gaulier. Her movement vocabulary is rich in gesture and finds expression in the entire body. Texts are often incorporated into the work, with sources ranging from Shakespeare to the original work of Claudia’s own cast. She also works closely with composers, musicians and designers to create in each project a hybrid of dance, theatre, music, performance art and visual design.
MOonhORsE Dance Theatre.
In 1996, she founded MOonhORsE dance theatre (“moon” for poetry, “horse” for physical) as a forum for the deepening of her choreographic language and the creation of contemporary dance. Since its inception, the company has created an original body of dance theatre.
Moore's choreography is "body poetry", expressing the human condition with a startling physical imagination. Along with her gifted performers, she weaves movement from the whimsy, drama, and passion of life. MOonhORsE dance theatre encompasses a range of artistic endeavors including "Older and Reckless" - a performance series that features new work by senior dance artists and "Poetry in Space" - the company's professional development workshops. MOonhORsE dance theatre also commissions guest choreographers, co-produces dancefilm projects and contributes to the education of young people in the field of the performing arts.

Mixed anxiety-depressive disorder

Mixed anxiety-depressive disorder is a diagnostic category defining patients who suffer from both anxiety and depressive symptoms of limited and equal intensity accompanied by at least some autonomic features. The World Health Organization's ICD-10 describes "Mixed anxiety and depressive disorder" : "...when symptoms of anxiety and depression are both present, but neither is clearly predominant, and neither type of symptom is present to the extent that justifies a diagnosis if considered separately. When both anxiety and depressive symptoms are present and severe enough to justify individual diagnoses, both diagnoses should be recorded and this category should not be used."
Diagnosis.
The symptoms of anxiety and depression disorders can be very similar. A diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depressive disorder as opposed to a diagnosis of depression or an anxiety disorder can be difficult. "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders IV" has defined certain requirements for diagnosing mixed anxiety-depressive disorder:
Risk factors.
Risk factors for mixed anxiety-depressive disorder include risk factors for either depression or anxiety disorders. These risk factors often overlap and may include:
Treatment.
Treating mixed anxiety-depressive disorder can be difficult for physicians because some treatments are more effective for depressive symptoms where others are more effective for anxiety symptoms.
Most clinical prescriptions are created for patients who only have symptoms of one specific mental health disorder rather than mixed disorders; some treatments such as SSRI antidepressants, sometimes combined with benzodiazepines, have been proven to be effective for both anxiety and depression, so these treatments may be most promising medication-wise for the disorder. The current treatment that has been most effective is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
Causes.
Throughout studies of anxiety disorders and depressive disorders, scientists have come to multiple conclusions about the cause. This disorder is caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. These factors include imbalances to neurotransmitters in the brain, traumas, stresses, and an unstable home environment. Since the possible causes of anxiety disorders and depressive disorders are so similar, it is not surprising that these disorders occur so frequently together: approximately 58% of patients with major depression also have an anxiety disorder, and approximately 17.2% of patients with generalized anxiety disorder also have depression.

Monitor, the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts, authorised Essex Rivers Healthcare NHS Trust to become an NHS foundation trust from 1 May 2008.
Staff.
In 2007/08 the Trust employed 3,383 people, 86% of them directly involved in patient care.
Hospital sites.
The Trust's main acute hospital site, which was opened in 1984, is Colchester General Hospital. The Trust also owns Essex County Hospital in Colchester, which was opened in 1820 and has two wards used for oncology (cancer) patients. The Trust also provides services at Halstead Hospital. At Harwich and Clacton community hospitals, both managed by NHS North East Essex (the PCT), the Trust provides maternity, minor injury and outpatient services.
Quality.
In 2009 the Chair of the Trust, Richard W. Bourne, was removed by Monitor because it was failing to meet clinical targets.
In November 2013 the Care Quality Commission reported that it had found discrepancies between the hospital's cancer waiting time records and the information contained in patients' individual medical records. 22 out of 61 records showed people had been put "at risk of receiving care that was unsafe or not effective, due to delays in receiving appointments or treatment". In November 2013 the Trust was placed in special measures by Monitor. Gordon Coutts, the chief executive, who had been on sick leave announced on 18 December 2013 that he would not be returning to the post.

Isoantibodies

Isoantibodies (formerly called alloantibody) are antibodies produced by an individual against isoantigens produced by members of the same species. In the case of human race there are significant number of antigens which are different in every individual. When antigens from another individual is introduced into one's body, these isoantibodies immediately bind to and destroy them.
One common example is the isohaemagglutinins, which are responsible for blood transfusion reactions.
Isoantigens.
A protein or other substance, such as histocompatibility or red blood cell antigens, that is present in only some members of a species and therefore able to stimulate isoantibody production in other members of the same species who lack it. When injected into another animal, they trigger an immune response aimed at eliminating them. Therefore, it can be thought of as an antigen that is present in some members of the same species, but is not common to all members of that species. If an alloantigen is presented to a member of the same species that does not have the alloantigen, it will be recognized as foreign. They are the products of polymorphic genes.
Production of isohaemagglutinins.
Isoantibodies are seen in people with different blood groups. The anti-A or anti-B isoantibodies or both (also called isohaemagglutinins) are produced by an individual against the antigens (A or B) on the RBCs of other blood groups. In a person with A blood group, the plasma will contain isoantibodies against B antigens, so immediately after transfusion of blood from B group the anti-B isohemagglutinins agglutinate the foreign red blood cells.
Anti-A and anti-B antibodies (called Isohaemagglutinins), which are not present in the newborn, appear in the first years of life. It is possible that food and environmental antigens (bacterial, viral or plant antigens) have epitopes similar enough to A and B glycoprotein antigens. The antibodies created against these environmental antigens in the first years of life can cross react with ABO-incompatible red blood cells when it comes in contact with during blood transfusion later in life. Anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM type. O-type individuals can produce IgG-type ABO antibodies.

Shahbaz Khan Kamboh

Shahbaz Khan Kamboh (1529 – 11 November 1599) was one of the most capable and trustworthy Generals of Mughal Emperor Akbar. He participated in some of the most difficult expeditions of Akbar and annexed numerous territories to the empire. He was too orthodox a Sunni Muslim for Akbar's taste, but not only was he tolerated but also was greatly valued.
Early life and family background.
Shahbaz Khan's real name was "Shahrullah". He is believed to have born in 1529 AD. His sixth ancestor, Haji Ismail Kamboh was a disciple of the renowned saint Bahauddin Zakariya of Multan. His fore-fathers were all celebrated for piety, asceticism and religiosity. He belonged to the Kamboh lineage whose roots are traceable to the well-known ancient Indo-Iranian or better, Iranian tribe -- the Kambojas, whose name looms large in ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts as well as in king Asoka's edict records..
Shahbaz Khan had entered Mughal service during Akbar's time. The Emperor was very much impressed by his sagacity and sharpness of intellect at the very first sight and soon elevated him to the rank of "Mir Tozak" (Quarter-Master General) and later to an "Amir" (Minister). Shahbaz Khan was very capable officer and a brave soldier and had rendered meritorious service to the Mughal empire in various capacities. From a mansab of 100, he rapidly rose the number to 5000. As a Governor of Bengal, when operating in Brahmputra, Shahbaz Khan had commanded 9000 strong cavalry.
He was an all-rounder officer and besides his military duties, he also helped Akbar in civil administration and financial matters. He became a very close confidant, a companion, a "Mir Bakhshi" (head of the military department, holding the rank of imperial minister) and a "Vakil" (Chief Administrator or Prime Minister) of Akbar and had acquired and exercised great powers. In 1581, when Emperor Akbar marched against Mirza Hakim to the Punjab, Shahbaz Khan came to Fatehpur and for about ten months, he took in his hands the reins of state administration in the absence of the Emperor.
As a General.
In 1572, General Lashkar Khan entered the royal court in a drunken state and challenged anybody to come and fight with him. His rowdy and blatant behavior annoyed His Majesty so much that he was ordered to be arrested, tied to the tail of a horse and dragged and finally thrown into the prison. He was replaced with Shahbaz Khan whom the emperor made his "Mir Bakshi" (Paymaster-General). The title of "Shahbaz Khan" was also conferred on him. 
Introducing Dagh-o-Mahali.
As soon as Shahbaz Khan became Mir Bakshi, he introduced the "Dagh-o-Mahali" (a branding system) which had considerably cut down the over-heads as well as the corruption prevalent in the military departments of the kingdom. The system had been earlier in vogue during Alauddin Khilji as well as Sher Shah Suri but was discontinued during Mughal rule and was replaced with fief system which came to be badly misused by the Amirs and the officers. Under this system, the country was divided into numerous fiefs which were distributed among the Amirs. Unfortunately, they had become greedy, corrupt and oppressive and often also rebellious. Major part of the revenue was misappropriated by the fief-holders for personal use. Shahbaz Khan changed the system and handled the branding system with such a skill and competency that not only it ended the rampant corruption but also improved discipline in the military and reduced needless financial burden on the imperial treasury. But the new system had earned Shahbaz Khan the hatred of the nobles like Mirza Aziz Koka He severely criticized the new system.
Battle against Rathods.
In the beginning of 1576 AD, Shahbaz Khan proceeded against Kalah Rai and Mal Deo Rai, the rebel Rathod Rajputs of Jodhpur and brought them under control. He also attacked the fort of Daigur which resulted in the deaths of numerous Rathods. Shabaz Khan captured the fort of Sewana which was under possession of Raja Chander Sen, the son of Raja Mal Deo. Consequently, Shahbaz Khan was appointed its commandant.
Battle against Rana Pratap.
In 1577 AD, Shahbaz Khan was appointed to command the force against Rana Kika (also known as Rana Pratap) of Udaipur to ravage and occupy his country. By reason of their knowledge of the country (Mewar), Akbar had also attached Raja Bhagwant Das and his son Man Singh to this force but General Shahbaz Khan refused to take them in his army unit. Shahbaz Khan laid the country waste and made Rana flee to mountains and jungles. Upon reaching the fort of Kombalmer, Shahbaz Khan laid siege to it and captured it in few days. The Rana Pratap made his escape from the fort by night in disguise. Shahbaz Khan setup 50 police posts in mountainous regions and 30 in the plains to keep control over the rebellious Rajputs.
Battle against Arab Bahadur.
General Shahbaz Khan had nearly driven Rana Pratap from the country when he was summoned by the emperor and sent with an army to support the forces in Bengal against Arab Bahadur. When Shahbaz Khan came near to Hajipur where Arab Bahadur had taken refuge with Raja Gajpati, he marched to attack him. For one month he carried operations against him clearing away the jungle and finally drove off Arab Bahadur and made the Raja Gajpati submit.
Battle against Bahadhur Khan-i-Shaibani.
Bahadhur Khan-i-Shaibani and his brother Khan Zaman-i-Shaibani were Amir Viziers in the court of Akbar and both were holding big Jagirs, but as luck would have it, they rebelled against the emperor. With the help of Shahbaz Khan, Akbar crushed the rebellion with an iron hand. General Khan Zaman-i-Shaibani was killed in the battle but Bahadhur Khan was executed by Shahbaz Khan and Rai Bansi Das Kamboh on orders of the emperor.
In 1581, when Emperor Akbar marched against Mirza Hakim to the Punjab, Shahbaz Khan came to Fatehpur and for about ten months, he took in his hands the reins of state administration in the absence of the Emperor.
As Governor of Bengal.
On 18 May 1583, Shahbaz Khan was appointed Governor of Bengal. Initially, he had commanded 5000 cavalry and had distinguished himself greatly in Bengal, but later when operating in Brahmputra, he had commanded 9000 strong cavalry.
Tarsun Khan was engaged in war against Masum Khan. Shahbaz Khans's forces invested Dinajpur and Masum Khan was thus besieged in Dinajpur. The combined forces of Shahbaz Khan and Tarsun Khan attacked Masum Khan on November 15, 1583, but the latter fled to Bhati while Jabbari, an ally of Masum Khan, fled to Koch Bihar. Masum Khan got refuge with Isa Khan at Bhati. 
Battle against Isa Khan.
In 1584, Shahbaz Khan crossed Ganges near Khizirpur and seized Sonargaon and ravaged Bakatpur where Isa Khan was trenched. Initially he achieved a considerable success and even ravaged Katrabo, Khizirpur, Sonargaon and Egarasindur but finally suffered a defeat in the battle of Egarasindur and Bhawal. He was forced to retreat to Tandah. With reinforcements sent by Akbar, Shahbaz Khan again marched towards Bhati in 1586. Isa Khan attacked Shahbaz Khan at Bhawal (north of Dhaka) but forces of Shahbaz Khan were well fortified near Brahmaputra. Shahbaz Khan had commanded a 9000 strong cavalry at Brahmaputra.
In 1585, Shahbaz Khan subdued Raja of Kukrah or Coira Orissa (Chhota Nagpur) a tributary to the Crown. According to Ai’n-i-Akbari, Kukrah or Coira Orissa was a part of Bihar Subah.
Shahbaz Khan was sent to Deccan to help Murad. Shahbaz Khan reduced one Tiyuldar of Madhopur fort and obtained tribute from him. During conquest of Ahmmad Nagar, Shahbaz Khan harassed the Muslims and ravaged their houses which was greatly resented by Murad. Thereby, Shahbaz Khan left Murad without permission and reached Malwa. Akbar took away his Jagir and gave it Shah-Rukh and transferred Shahbaz Khan.
Reappointed as Governor of Bengal.
In November 1586, Shahbaz Khan was again appointed Governor of Bengal in which capacity he served for two years before leaving in 1588. Shahbaz Khan was one of the best Khan best Khans during his governorship of Bangala and Orissa.
Shahbaz Khan had also subdued the pride of Raja Ram Chander Sain, Rai Surjan Handa & Dauda, Farhat Khan, Raja Gajpati, Raja Sri Ram, Rana Sangram as well as the officers of Surat. He reduced Jagdenpur, Ara, Shergarh, and Rahitas etc. These conquests had greatly enhanced the prestige and status of Shahbaz Khan which were greatly appreciated by Akbar. 
In 1589 AD, General Shabaz Khan led an expedition from Attock against the Yousafzai Afghans and defeated and dispersed them.
Imprisoned.
Shahbaz Khan had been kept in confinement for three years before he paid a fine (ransom) of seven lacs of rupees. He was set free in 1599 and appointed as the deputy to the prince Jahangir in the administration of the province of Ajmer (Malwa). He was the General Administrator of Malwa which office he held till his death.
Shahbaz Khan died of illness on 11 November 1599 at Ajmer at the age of over 70 years. 
As an administrator.
Shahbaz Khan was a very able and efficient officer and his military division was always found in excellent conditions. Historian Abu-L-Fazl Alami, the author of "Aiana-i-Akbari", attests that Shahbaz Khan was a very competent and capable General but Abu-L-Fazal also accuses him for his bigoted "Sunni" views and arrogance. Many a times, he strongly opposed the emperor, but Akbar had a great regard for Shahbaz Khan and took it lightly. 
The 9000 strong cavalry of General Shahbaz Khan is said to have comprised mostly the Kamboj (Kamboh) horsemen and it included both the Muslim as well as the Hindu Kamboj soldiers. He used to pay an annual salary of one lakh rupees each to ten of his officers and none (of his servants) had a subsistence-stipend less than five six thousand. The total annual expenses on his division was over 30 lakh Indian Ruppees during those times. He did not leave the Kambohs clan in the whole of India unemployed; he took all of them in his service. 
Shahbaz Khan was known for his generosity and liberality and the money he spent was so great that it made the people think that he had in his possession Philosopher's stone. He left behind a huge Jagir and treasure exceeding ten millions rupees and other wealth which was seized by Jahangir, son of Emperor Akbar after his death.
As a religious man.
Shabaz Khan belonged the family whose ancestors were all celebrated for piety, asceticism and religiosity. Shahbaz Khan in early part of his life was celebrated for his religiosity till he first became deputy Kotwal of the Chabutara when he displayed his awareness of the (affairs of the) kingdom and judicious disposal of matters. Afterwards, he became Kotwal and became a favorite of His Majesty, Emperor Akbar. He was a capable officer and brave fighter and had rendered meritorious service to the state in various capacities. A leading courtier of Akbar, he was strict follower of the law of Shari’ah and profusely recited blessings on the Prophet and distributed large sum of money in charities. Every Friday, he would donate one hundred Asharfis (gold coins) in memory of Abdul-Qadir Gilani. 
Shahbaz Khan himself was deeply religious and pious man. He did not put on dress outside the sanction of simna (i.e. which had no sanction of the Prophet's action). He always carried a rosary in his hand, reciting all the while invocations of God's salutations on the chief of the world (prophet Muhammad) and between the evening and sunset prayers, he would sit down facing west (qibla) and offering nimaz. He did not follow other Khans as long as he was alive in shaving off his beard and drinking wine and did not have (the word) Murid on his signet. He remained steadfast in the religion of Islam and left his name in the world of generosity and religiosity. 
Emperor Akbar tried his best to bring General Shahbaz Khan and another General Qutb-ud-din Muhammad Khan Koka into his new faith known as "Din-i-Ilahi" but the move was strongly criticized by both of them. This, according to Abu-L-Fazl had created obstacles in his promotion upwards. On the other hand, many incompetent and junior officers got promoted which they did never deserve.

Granada War

The Granada War () was a series of military campaigns between 1482 and 1492, during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs "(los Reyes Católicos)" Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, against the Nasrid dynasty's Emirate of Granada. It ended with the defeat of Granada and its annexation by Castile, ending Islamic rule, Al-Andalus, on the Iberian peninsula and completing the Reconquista.
The ten-year war was not a continuous effort: it was a series of seasonal campaigns launched in the spring and postponed in the winter. The Granadans were crippled by internal conflict and civil war; meanwhile the Christians were generally unified. The war also saw the effective use of artillery by the Christians to rapidly conquer towns that would have required a long siege otherwise. The decisive Battle of Granada concluded the war. On January 2, 1492 Muhammad XII of Granada (King Boabdil) surrendered the Emirate of Granada, the city of Granada, and the Alhambra palace. It is still celebrated every year on that date by the City Council of Granada.
The war was a joint project between Isabella's Kingdom of Castile and León, and Ferdinand's Crown of Aragon. The bulk of the troops and funds for the war came from Castile, and Granada was annexed into Castile's lands. The Crown of Aragon was less important: apart from the presence of King Ferdinand himself, Aragon provided naval collaboration, guns, and some financial loans. Aristocrats were offered the allure of new lands, while Ferdinand and Isabella centralized and consolidated power. The aftermath of the war saw the end of "convivencia" ("live and let live") between religions. The Jews were forced to convert to Christianity or be exiled in 1492. In 1501, all of Granada's Muslims were obliged to either convert to Christianity, become slaves, or be exiled; by 1526 this prohibition spread to the rest of Spain. "New Christians" ("conversos") came to be accused of crypto-Islam and crypto-Judaism, often accurately. Spain would go on to model its national aspirations as the guardian of Christianity and Catholicism.
Iberia and Al-Andalus in the late 15th century.
The Emirate of Granada had been the sole Muslim state in Al-Andalus - Iberia - for more than a century by the time of the Granada War. The other remnant states of the Caliphate of Córdoba ("taifa") had already been conquered by the Reconquista. Pessimism for Granada's future existed even then; in 1400, Ibn Hudayl wrote "Is Granada not enclosed between a violent sea and an enemy terrible in arms, both of which press on its people day and night?" Still, Granada was wealthy and powerful, and the Christian kingdoms were divided and fought amongst themselves. Granada's problems began to worsen after Emir Yusuf III's death in 1417. Succession struggles made it such that Granada was in an almost constant low-level civil war. Loyalty to clan was stronger than that to the Emir, making consolidation of power difficult. Often, the only territory the Emir really controlled was the city of Granada itself. At times, the emir did not even control all the city, but rather one emir would control the Alhambra, and another the Albaicín, the most important district of Granada.
This internal fighting greatly weakened the state. The economy declined, with Granada's once world-famous porcelain now disrupted and challenged by Manises near Valencia. Taxes were still imposed at their earlier high rates to support Granada's extensive defenses and large army, despite the weakening economy. Ordinary Granadans paid triple the taxes of (non-tax-exempt) Castilians. The heavy taxes that Emir Abu-l-Hasan Ali (1464–85) imposed contributed greatly to his unpopularity. These taxes did at least support a respected army; Hasan was successful in putting down Christian revolts in his lands, and some observers estimated he could muster as many as 7,000 horsemen.
The frontier between Granada and Andalusia was in a constant state of flux, "neither in peace nor in war." Raids across the border were common, as were intermixing alliances between local nobles on both sides of the frontier. Relations were governed by occasional truces and demands for tribute should one side have been seen to overstep their bounds. Neither country's central government intervened or controlled the warfare much.
King Henry IV of Castile died in December 1474, setting off the War of the Castilian Succession between Henry's daughter Juana la Beltraneja and Henry's half-sister Isabella. The war raged from 1475–1479, setting Isabella's supporters and the Crown of Aragon against Juana's supporters, Portugal, and France. During this time, the frontier with Granada was practically ignored; the Castilians did not even bother to ask for or obtain reparation for a raid in 1477. Truces between the sides were agreed upon in 1475, 76, and 78. In 1479, the Succession War concluded with Isabella victorious. As Isabella had married Ferdinand of Aragon in 1469, this meant that the two powerful kingdoms of Castile and Aragon would now stand united, free from inter-Christian war which had helped Granada survive.
Chronology.
Provocations and responses.
The truce of 1478 was still theoretically in effect when Granada launched a surprise attack against Zahara in December, 1481, as part of a reprisal for a Christian raid. The town fell, and the population was enslaved. This attack proved to be a great provocation, and factions in favor of war in Andalusia used it to rally support for a counterstrike, quickly moving to take credit for it, and backed a wider war. The seizure of Alhama and its subsequent royal endorsement is usually said to be the formal beginning of the Granada War. Abu Hasan attempted to retake Alhama by siege in March, but was unsuccessful. Reinforcements from the rest of Castile and Aragon closed off the possibility of retaking Alhama in April 1482; King Ferdinand himself formally took command at Alhama on May 14, 1482.
The Christians next tried to besiege Loja, Granada, but failed to take the town. This setback was balanced by a twist that would prove to aid them greatly, though: on the same day as Loja's relief, Abu Hasan's son, Boabdil, rebelled and styled himself Emir Muhammad XII. The war continued into 1483. Abu Hasan's brother, Al-Zagal, defeated the Christian army near Malaga. However, at the battle of Axarquia, the Christians were able to defeat and capture King Boabdil. Ferdinand II and Isabella I had previously not been intent on conquering all of Granada. With the capture of King Boabdil, though, Ferdinand decided to use Boabdil to conquer Granada entirely. In a letter of August 1483, Ferdinand wrote "To put Granada in division and destroy it We have decided to free him... He has to make war on his father." With Boabdil's release, now as a pseudo-Christian ally, the Granadan civil war would continue. A Granadan chronicler commented that Boabdil's capture was "the cause of the fatherland's destruction."
In 1485, the fortunes of the Granadan internal conflict shifted yet again. Boabdil was expelled from the Albayzín, his base of power, by Hasan's brother al-Zagal. Al-Zagal also took command of the nation itself, dethroning his aging brother who died shortly thereafter. Boabdil was obliged to flee to Ferdinand and Isabella's protection. The continuing division within the Muslim ranks and the cunning of the Marquis of Cádiz allowed the western reaches of Granada to be seized with unusual speed in 1485. Ronda fell to him after a mere fifteen days, thanks to his negotiations with the city's leaders. Ronda's fall allowed Marbella, a base of the Granadan fleet, to come into Christian hands next.
Boabdil was soon released from Christian protection to resume his bid for control of Granada. For the next three years, he would act as functionally one of Ferdinand and Isabella's vassals. He offered the promise of limited independence for Granada and peace with the Christians to the citizenry; from the Catholic Monarchs, he extracted the title of Duke for whatever cities he could control.
Seizure of Málaga.
Málaga, the chief seaport of Granada, was the main objective of the Castilian forces in 1487. Granadan leader al-Zagal was slow to march to attempt to relieve the siege and was unable to safely harass the Christian armies due to the ongoing civil war; even after he left to attempt to save Malaga, he was forced to leave troops in the Alhambra to defend against Boabdil and his followers. 
The first main city to be attacked, Vélez-Málaga, capitulated on 27 April 1487. Local supporters of Boabdil directly aided the Christian besiegers. Málaga held out during an extended siege that lasted from 7 May 1487 until 18 August 1487 with a bitter resistance; its commander preferred death to surrender, and the African garrison and Christian "renegades" (converts to Islam) fought tenaciously fearing the consequences of defeat. Near the end, the notables of Malaga finally offered a surrender, but Ferdindad wasn't interested, as generous terms had already been offered twice. When the city finally fell, Fernandez punished almost all the inhabitants for their stubborn resistance with slavery. Renegades were burned alive or pierced by reeds. The Jews of Malaga, however, were spared, as Castilian Jews ransomed them from slavery.
Historian William Prescott considered the fall of Málaga the most important part of the war; as the chief port of Granada, Granada could not reasonably continue on as an independent state without it.
Siege of Baza.
al-Zagal lost prestige from the fall of Málaga, and Boabdil took over all of the city of Granada in 1487; he additionally controlled the northeast of the country with Vélez-Rubio, Vélez-Blanco, and Vera. al-Zagal still controlled Baza, Guadix, and Almería. Boabdil took no action as the Christian forces took some of his land, perhaps assuming it would shortly be returned to him.
In 1489, the Christian forces began a painfully long siege of Baza, the most important stronghold remaining of al-Zagal's. Baza was highly defensible as it required the Christians to split their armies, and artillery was little use against it. The siege lasted 6 months; supplying the army caused a huge budget shortfall for the Castilians. Occasional threats of deprivation of office were necessary to keep the army in the field, and Isabella came personally to the siege to keep morale of both the nobles and the soldiers high. After 6 months, al-Zagal surrendered, despite his garrison still being largely unharmed; he had become convinced that the Christians were serious about maintaining the siege as long as it would take, and further resistance was useless without the long-term hope of relief, which there wasn't. Baza was granted generous surrender terms, unlike Málaga.
Last stand at Granada.
With the fall of Baza and the capture of al-Zagal, in 1490 it seemed as if the war was over. Ferdinand and Isabella thought this was the case. However, Boabdil was unhappy with the rewards for his alliance with Ferdinand and Isabella, possibly because lands that had been promised to him were being administered by Castile. He broke off his vassalage and rebelled against the Catholic Monarchs, despite holding only the city of Granada and the Alpujarras Mountains. It was clear that such a position was untenable in the long term, so Boabdil sent out desperate requests for external aid. The Sultan of Egypt, An-Nasir Muhammad, mildly rebuked Ferdinand for the Granada War, but the Mamluks that ruled Egypt were in a near constant war with the Ottoman Turks. As Castile and Aragon were fellow enemies of the Turks, the Sultan had no desire to break their alliance against the Turks. Boabdil also requested aid from the Kingdom of Fez (modern Morocco), but no reply is recorded by history. North Africa continued to sell Castile wheat throughout the war and valued maintaining good trade relations. Furthermore, the Granadans no longer controlled any coastline with which to receive overseas aid in any case. No help would be forthcoming for Granada.
An eight-month siege of the Emirate of Granada began in April 1491. The situation for the defenders grew progressively more dire, as their forces for interfering with the siege dwindled and advisers schemed against each other. Bribery of important officials was rampant, and at least one of the chief advisers to Emir Boabdil seems to have been working for Castile the entire time. After the Battle of Granada provisional surrender, the Treaty of Granada (1491), was signed on November 25, 1491, which granted two months to the city. The reason for the long delay was not so much intransigence on either side, but rather the inability of the Granadan government to coordinate amongst itself in the midst of the disorder and tumult that gripped the city. After the terms were negotiated, which proved rather generous to the Muslims, the city capitulated on January 2, 1492. The besieging Christians sneaked troops into the Alhambra that day in case resistance materialized, which it did not. Granada's resistance had come to its end.
Tactics and technology.
The most notable facet of the Granada War was the power of bombards and cannons to greatly shorten the many sieges of the war. The Castilians and Aragonese started the war with only a few artillery pieces, but Ferdinand had access to French and Burgundian experts from his recent wars, and the Christians aggressively increased their forces. The Muslims, however, lagged far behind in their use of artillery, generally only using the occasional captured Christian piece. The historian Weston F. Cook Jr. wrote "Gunpowder firepower and artillery siege operations won the Granadan war, and other factors in the Spanish victory were actually secondary and derivative." By 1495, Castile and Aragaon controlled 179 pieces of artillery total, a vast increase from the paltry numbers seen in the War of the Castilian Succession.
Primitive arquebuses also saw use in the war, though only to a small degree. Heavy cavalry knights were a much smaller factor in the Granada War than seen in earlier warfare. Light cavalry jinetes took on a more prominent role instead. The open-field battles in which cavalry were the most important were rare; the Granadans, badly outnumbered, generally avoided such battles. The Castilians also employed a large number of supporting men; a huge force of workers were mustered in 1483 to destroy crops and pillage the countryside rather than engage directly in battle. Coordination and logistics was difficult given the mountainous terrain, but the Christians diligently built a series of roads through the mountains to supply their troops with food and supplies.
Politically, many nobles insisted on controlling their own forces, but Ferdinand and Isabella were still able to exercise a large degree of control in directing the army as a whole. The Granadans, meanwhile, were beset with the civil war, preventing the establishment of a unified command. The army was almost completely Castilian; Aragonese and foreign mercenary participation existed, but was minimal. Of the Castilian army, Andalusia contributed far more troops than the other territories, with much of its population conscripted into the war. The nobility provided the majority of the expensive cavalry.
The Granada War would prove to be valuable training for Castile's participation in the Italian Wars, where the Castilian armies and tactics such as the "tercio" would acquit themselves well.
Consequences.
The surrender of Granada was seen as a great blow to Islam and a triumph of Christianity. Other Christian states offered their sincere congratulations to Ferdinand and Isabella, while Islamic writers reacted with despair. In Castile and Aragon, celebrations and bullfights were held. People rejoiced in the streets.
The Treaty of Granada (1491) terms for Granada's surrender were quite generous to the Muslims, considering how little they had left to bargain with. They were similar to the terms offered to towns which surrendered earlier, when the outcome of the war was in doubt. For three years, Muslims could emigrate and return freely. They were allowed to keep weapons, though not firearms. (This provision was to be annulled a month later, though.) No one would be forced to change religion, not even former Christians who'd converted to Islam. Boabdil was offered money and the rulership of a small principality in the mountainous Alpujarras, an area that would have been difficult to control in any case. At first, most of conquered Granada was treated respectfully and so predominantly stable for seven years, though the Alhambra Decree of 1492 expelled the Jews that were not converso Marranos.
King Boabdil soon found his position intolerable. He left for Morocco in Oct 1493, where he would die some forty years later. Eventually, Castile started to revoke some of the more tolerant attributes of the treaty. This initiative was led by Archbishop Cisneros, who ordered the burning of valued Arabic manuscripts and other measures detrimental to the Muslims (and Jews). 
This sparked a revolt — sometimes called the First Rebellion of the Alpujarras — that ended in many Muslims being forced to choose between baptism and exile (or execution). Tensions from then onward would remain high, and Castile was obliged to maintain a large military force in Granada to deter future revolts. Isabella also strengthened the Spanish Inquisition, and Ferdinand brought the Inquisition to Aragon where previously it had not held power.
Castile was the main beneficiary of the war and completely annexed Granada. After all, Castile had also spent by far the majority of the money and manpower to prosecute the war. The conquest of Granada meant little for Aragon's strategic position, but it did help secure Castilian support in Italy and France, where Aragon's interests lay. Granada had presented a potential ally to France to act as a thorn in Castile and Aragon's side, much as Scotland did to England. Granada's conquest removed this weakness, enabling a more aggressive foreign policy.
Increasing oppression of the Moors - now known as Moriscos or "New Christians" - led to a second revolt throughout the province - particular in the Alpujarras - in 1568. This time almost all the Moriscos of Granada were expelled to other regions.
Cultural influence.
An entire genre, "romances fronterizos", developed around stories of the war and the battles on the Granadan frontier which reached their culmination in Granada's fall. Ginés Pérez de Hita wrote an early example of historical fiction, "Guerras civiles de Granada", a romantic account of the war that emphasized chivalry and heroism on both sides. A number of stories and songs appear to have been sponsored by the royal government to help steel morale for the long struggle; "Sobre Baza" was a poem written in 1479 encouraging persistence in the long siege. The song ""Setenil, ay Setenel"", written in 1484, hoped that Ferdinand would conquer "as far as Jerusalem." The song ""Una sañosa porfía"" by Juan del Encina puts the depiction of the war in the lips of King Boabdil himself.
The Día de la Toma de Granada is a civic and religious festival held each year in Granada on the anniversary of the city's reconquest, January 2.

Agonum

Agonum is a large genus of ground beetles in the subfamily Harpalinae, tribe Platynini. They are mid-sized to smallish beetles, typically with dark metallic hues – often reddish or bronze, but sometimes black, green etc.
The genus is generally native to the Holarctic and the Mediterranean region; their southern limit in Central Asia and the Himalaya region is less well understood, and they seem to range outward a bit out of their core regions (e.g. into East Africa).
They are wet-loving throughout their life cycle; the genus is well represented in Ireland for example, where they are more plentiful than anywhere else in Europe.
Subgenera and selected species.
While some subgenera are accepted by most authors (e.g. "Europhilus, Olisares" and of course "Agonum"), others are of disputed validity. Moreover, subgeneric separation has historically been mostly focussed on European and Japanese species. The following list does not incorporate the most recent reviews and must be considered very preliminary.

Philosophical consultancy

Philosophical Consultancy is a relatively new movement in philosophy which applies philosophical thinking and debating to the resolution of a person's problem. Gerd B. Achenbach and Ad Hoogendijk are two, German and Dutch philosophers who established themselves as consultant philosophers in the nineteen-eighties (Achenbach 1984, 2002; Hoogendijk 1988) and led the way to a number of other developments all over the world. They proposed an alternative to psychotherapeutic culture by working exclusively within the field of existential investigation with clients or patients, whom they called 'visitors.'
Achenbach argues that it is life that calls to thinking, rather than thinking that informs life. The act of philosophising can, therefore, give direction in its own right, as living precedes thinking and practice precedes theory.
The movement is sometimes referred to as philosophical counselling and it is also connected with and related to Existential Therapy, which has thrived in the United Kingdom since the establishment of the Society for Existential Analysis (SEA) in London in 1988. This was based on the work of Emmy van Deurzen, also a philosopher who has applied philosophical thinking to the practice of psychotherapy. Philosophical consultancy is often applied to business consultancy as well as to individuals, as it frequently involves a rethinking of values and beliefs and is also a method for rational conflict resolution.
Philosophical practice has continued to expand and is attractive as an alternative to counselling and psychotherapy for those who prefer to avoid a medicalization of life-problems. Numerous philosophical consultants have emerged and there is a strong international interest and a bi-annual international conference. There are a number of important publications in the field (Lahav and Tillmans 1995, Curnow 2001, Herrestad et al. 2002, Marinoff 1999, Rochelle 2008, 2011).

Shaikh Gadai Kamboh

Shaikh Gadai Kamboh was the son, disciple and successor of famous scholar, philosopher and poet-laureate Shaikh Jamali Kamboh of Delhi and brother of the " 'Master of Expression' "—Shaikh Abd-al-Hai Hayati. His real name was Abdur Rehman but he became famous as Gadai. He was well-renowned for his sanctity and learning and was in high favour with emperor Humayun and Bairam Khan. He is also said to have remained a "Musahib" of the Afghan emperor Salim Shah Suri. During Akbar’s reign, he occupied the high office of "“Sadr-i-sadur”" of Hindustan.
Early career.
Shaikh Gadai’s father Shaikh Jamali Kamboh had been an important courtier of Mughal emperors Babur as well as Humayun’s court. On Jamali’s death, emperor Humayun appointed Shaikh Gadai as his courtier. But after Humayun's defeat by Sher Shah Suri near Kanawdi in 1540 AD, Shaikh Gadai went to Gujarat. After the disastrous battle of Kanauj and the consequent troubles, Bairam Khan, an important Turkoman noble of emperor Humayun, took refuge in Gujarat where he was rendered a great help by Shaikh Gadai. It is stated that Bairam Khan had escaped from near Gwalior through the efforts and exertions of Shaikh Gadai and Babbal Khan. Later, Shaikh Gadai went to Arabia for pilgrimage. On his return, he remained in Gujarat for a while where he was joined by his numerous Murids and became famous in Gujarat for his opulent sessions of Sama.
Shaikh Gadai as "Sadr-i-sadur" of Hindustan.
With the restoration of Mughal rule in 1555, the political situation changed and Shaikh Gadai Kamboh re-joined Humayun’s court sometime before his death in March 1556. On Humayun's death, when Khan-i Khana, Bairam Khan became the regent of emperor Akbar, he soon issued a "firman" appointing Shaikh Gadai to the high office of "“Sadr-i-sadur”" ("Administrator General or Lord Chief Justice") of Emperor Akbar.
The ""Sadr-i-sadur"" or ""Sadr-i-jahan"" or ""Sadrat-i-mamalik"" ("Office of Lord Chief Justice and highest religious officer combined") had a very important position as all persecution under the canon law required his sanction and the letters of appointments for the "qazis" of "Subah" and "Sarkars", "muhtasibs", "Imams" and "mutawallis" for the stipends and the bills for charitable endowments were issued by him and under his sole authority. He also enjoyed more latitude than others in the matters of selecting king's departmental officers.
The office of ""Sadr-i-sadur"" had been very important before the Mughals' rule and even during Akbar’s reign, he was ranked the third most powerful officer in the empire. It was his legal edict which legalized the accession of new king. By the time of Akbar the office had however, become corrupt especially so in the administration of grants & pensions and hence after assuming the office, the first thing the Shaikh did was to draw the pen of obliteration through the grants and pensions of the old servants of the crown in order to control the wide spread corruption. Numerous old grantees and pensionees were thus affected by this step including probably also the chronicler Badāʼūnī (a cleric), the author of "Muntakhbu-a-Twarikh". Apparently hurt by this drastic administrative action, Badāʼūnī accordingly makes very vitriolic and personal attacks on Shaikh Gadai Kamboh.
Mughal historian `Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni ("Abd al-Qādir ibn Mulūk Shāh Badāʼūnī") witnesses that Shaikh Gadai Kamboh achieved the rank of ""Sadr-i-sadur"" of emperor Akbar and, "“for several years, he was resorted to as an authority on the religious questions by the sages and principal men of Hindustan, Khurasan, Transoxians and Iraq “" .
Shaikh Gadai was the right hand man of Bairam Khan. Bairam Khan never did any political or financial business without consulting the Shaikh. Shaikh Gadai also obtained powers to put his seal on the firmans. He was exempted from the ceremony of homage and in assemblies, he was given precedence over Saiyids and Ulemas. His position was so high that he did not have to dismount the horse when paying respects to the king. Emperor Akbar had a great respect for the Shaikh. Everyone in the "Darbar-a-Akbari" was required to bow his head and wave his beard to pay obeisance to the emperor, but Shaikh Gadai was an exception. The emperor himself would come to the Shaikh to seek his blessings. Both Bairam Khan and Akbar used to be often present in his house at "Sama" sessions or singing parties.
As ""Sadr-i-sadur"", Shaikh Gadai had wielded immense powers in the matters of general administration. During Akbar reign, the office of ""Sadr-i-sadur"" ranked third or fourth in the empire. His powers were immense. He was the highest law officer and had the powers which the Administrators-General have amongst us in modern times; he was in-charge of all lands dedicated to ecclesiastical and benevolent purposes and possessed an almost unlimited authority of conferring such lands independently of the king. He was also the highest ecclesiastical law officer and exercised the powers of High Inquistor 
Mughal Historians's criticism of Shaikh Gadai.
Mughal historians of Akbar's reign who compiled their works after the fall of Bairam Khan are very critical of Shaikh Gadai and accuse him of arrogance, high-handedness and favoritism in the distribution of land grants and stipends among the Shaikhs, Sayyids, Scholars and other deserving persons. So much so, even Akbar complained in his "firman" to Bairam Khan issued at the time of latter's dismissal that one of his misdeeds was the elevation of Shaikh Gadai to the "Sadarat" in preference to the Sayyids and other Ulemas. However, it was soon later found that these complaints and grievances were concocted by Chugtai Turk nobles to provide young Akbar with a pretext to remove Bairam Khan, a Turkoman, from the power. According to Shaikh Rizk Allah Mushtakt who is the earliest source on this issue, Shaikh Gadai had played a very important role at the beginning of Akbar's reign and Bairam Khan did not transact any political and financial business without consulting him. The dominant orthodox Chugtai Turk nobles who "wanted to get rid of Bairam Khan because of his being an Iranized Turk as well as for his Shiite beliefs", always tried to poison Akbar's ears against him. They also got annoyed with Shaikh Gadai Kamboh his right hand man when he refused to toe their line to join hands with them against Bairam Khan and betray him, in spite of the fact that the Shaikh himself was an orthodox Sunni. It is wrongly stated by some writers that Shaikh Gadai Kamboh was Shia Muslim. ""While it appears that Bairam Khan held Shiite beliefs...Shaikh Gadai was undoubtedly a Sunni and not a Shiite"". Badāʼūnī, himself a Sunni, simply reflects extreme Sunni opinions when he makes Shaikh Gadai the special target of his personal attacks. Badāʾūnī plaintively writes: ""The honor (Sadr-i-Sadur) thus conferred gave the Shaikh the precedence over the magnates or grandees ("akabir") of Hindustan and Khorasan"".
Shaikh's personal attributes.
As a man of pleasant wit and acquired excellence, Shaikh was a born poet and used to compose and sing verses both in Persian and Hindi. He was also a gifted musician and his musical compositions were very famous during Akbar’s reign which he used to sing after the Indian manner of which pursuits he was passionately addicted Both Khan i Khanan and emperor Akbar used to be present in his house at the "Sama" sessions (singing parties) which orthodox Sunni Badāʼūnī however criticizes in severe terms. He was very fond of participating in the “Urs” ceremonies of the past saints saints, sages & pirs and would spend much money on arranging sama sessions.. Shaikh breathed his last in 976 Hijri (1574/75) at Delhi and was buried inside the tomb of his father, Shaikh Jamali in Mihrawil.

<doc id="20448974" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20448974" title="Fremont Canning Company">
Fremont Canning Company

Fremont Canning Company established the baby food enterprise of Gerber Products Company.
Founders.
The company was founded by Frank Daniel Gerber and his father in 1901 in Fremont, Michigan. The canning company began with a ten thousand dollar investment. The firm initially marketed canned peas, beans, fruits and other produce for local farmers. In its early years (from 1901 until 1908), the company struggled. In 1908, the United States economy in general recovered from a slump; the company then became profitable.
Expansion.
The firm expanded the plant in the pre-World War I years of 1914 and 1915, from seasonal to year-round production. Western Michigan and Fremont were hit by a postwar slump in 1919 to 1920 which slow down the company's sales and growth. In the later 1920s growth and the profits resumed. Gerber's son Daniel joined the company at this time.
Product shift.
The major change in the cannery company's direction came about around 1927 to 1928. Daniel suggested that they start making baby food; the idea originated with his wife, Dorothy. The couple had an ill baby daughter, Sally, who required extra care. A pediatrician suggested they prepare special food for the infant. This food was prepared with special cooking and straining methods, requiring much labor on the part of Dorothy Gerber. She suggested to Dan that perhaps they could make baby food at the canning company, since the only other way of obtaining this product was by prescription, which was very expensive. She thought that a market might exist for others in a similar situation. The canning company was already producing similar products for adults.
The company researched producing and selling baby food. They planned to sell the product for less than half the prescription price. One of the keys to the canning company’s successful marketing was an advertisement for baby food placed in "Good Housekeeping" magazine. It got mothers of infants to participate directly in a coupon redemption program. The introductory offer was six cans of the canning company’s soup and strained vegetables for $1.00 in exchange for the name of a favorite grocer. They sought to generate enough responses that they could offer proof to grocers of the new demand for stocking their baby food on shelves. This campaign stressed the nutritional and time-saving value of its foods.
Marketing.
The canning company’s brokers were then able persuade grocers to stock their baby foods. The marketing idea was successful and within sixty days "Gerber Strained Foods" had gained national distribution to some extent. There was almost full national distribution within six months. It also became world known about this time. Fremont Canning Company had created the new U.S. industry of commercial baby food.
The Gerber Baby.
The "Gerber Baby" symbol was initiated to reassure mothers and grocers that the concept was sound and to help identify the product. The sales in the first year was over a half million cans which produced gross revenues exceeding a third of a million dollars. During the Great Depression of the 1930s the canning company expanded its baby food lines. Some of the techniques they employed to increase its production output were:
Gerber Products Company.
In 1938 the canning company started dealing directly with the wholesaler. This proved beneficial and by 1941 baby foods exceeded adult foods in their production lines. The company then changed its name to the "Gerber Products Company" since it was devoting itself solely to baby foods. The consumer demand was for a million cans of baby food every week. The company dropped its adult foods altogether by 1943 and, soon thereafter, opened a second baby food plant in Oakland, California. Other plants were subsequently opened in New York and Canada. The company's timing was excellent in that it was best prepared to meet the post-World War II baby boom. The former Fremont Canning Company had become the basis for the burgeoning baby food industry. The company introduced its trademark slogan: ""Babies are our business ... our only business."" In later years, this slogan on packaging was shortened to only ""Babies are our business"". Additionally, in the 1970s and 1980s, this slogan was ""Babies are our business ... and have been for over 50 years"".

Mid-Afternoon Barks

Mid-Afternoon Barks () is a 2007 Chinese film directed by Zhang Yuedong. The film was the first directorial effort for Zhang, who was previously an established theater director in Beijing.
"Mid-Afternoon Barks" is a surrealist triptych of stories that take place in Beijing, all involving the installation of electrical poles. 
The film shared the Dragons and Tigers Award at the 2007 Vancouver International Film Festival with "Fujian Blue" by director Weng Shouming.
Plot.
The first of three stories told in "Mid-Afternoon Barks", "The Village and the Stranger", follows a herdsman (Zhang Yuedong) who has abandoned his flock for a village in the Beijing municipality. Taking residence with his roommate (Qieli Dunzhu), he is asked by his landlord (Gadi Qieli) to install an electric metal pole in the courtyard outside their apartment. It becomes increasingly difficult to determine, however, whether the request was part of a dream or not, or indeed if the herdsman is even in Beijing.
In the second tale, entitled "City, Wood, Repairman", three workmen (played by Han Dong, Chu Cheng, and Gouzi) in the city are installing poles but to no apparent purpose. A seemingly unrelated but parallel story between a repairman (Quan Ke) and a young man (the film's composer Xiao He) rounds out this part of the film. 
In the final tale, "Watermelon and Farmer", a farmer (Xiao He, again), is constantly bothered by rude customers, children, and workmen, who make him move his cart in order to attach electrical wires to the film's ubiquitous poles.
Style.
For one critic, "Mid-Afternoon Barks" was "a distinctive debut that doesn't quite resemble any other Chinese pic out there," and a film that had an "absurdist perspective." A description of the film for its North American premiere at the Vancouver International Film Festival suggested that the "unfinished" nature of the encounters that the characters go through are suggestive of a dream state, an observation echoed by critics. 
The film's soundtrack is equally bizarre, incorporating seemingly random noises (including titular barking) whose sources are never revealed. Variety's Derek Elley wrote how, "the enchanting score by Xiao He... brims with strange, percussive sounds and accompanies the sharply edited scenes (often punctuated by brief blackouts)..."
Reception.
The release of "Mid-Afternoon Barks" announced a new voice in Chinese cinema. "Time Out's" David Jenkins wrote that the film, while requiring a tremendous amount of patience from the audience, was nevertheless a "dreamy, lyrical, and often baffling journey."
For some critics, however, the same qualities that were lyrical or dreamy to others proved alienating, and that the film's tone could have been matched by simply "taking a walk outside."
Making its North American premiere at the Vancouver International Film Festival, "Mid-Afternoon Barks" shared the Dragons and Tigers Award with fellow Chinese film "Fujian Blue". In rewarding the film, the three-person jury (South Korean filmmaker Jang Sun-woo, Bangkok Post critic Kong Rithdee, and producer Colin McCabe) noted that the film was "witty...and well observed." The film's unique score also did not go unrecognized. Xiao He's work received a nomination for Best Score at the 2nd Asian Film Awards, though it did not win.

Frank Daniel Gerber

Frank Daniel Gerber (July 12, 1873 - October 7, 1952) was an American manufacturer of baby food.
Early life.
Gerber was born in the town of Douglas in Allegan County, Michigan in 1873. He graduated from Fremont High School of Western Michigan in 1887. He attended Valparaiso Normal School in Valparaiso, Indiana for one year, to learn to become a teacher.
Gerber’s father owned a tannery and Gerber joined his father’s firm when he was sixteen. Gerber became a partner of the firm within five years and managed it until it closed in 1905.
Career.
Gerber founded Fremont Canning Company in 1901 with his father to market local produce for the farmers. They canned the farmers' peas, beans, and fruits. This company was the basis of the baby food industry. 
Gerber became its president of Fremont Canning Company in 1917 when his father died. This first year as president of the firm, Gerber had sales that exceeded one million dollars. Gerber expanded the facilities for year-round production in 1914-1915. Before the production was seasonal. Gerber's son Daniel joined the company in 1920. He became assistant general manager of the canning company in 1926.
Gerber had a granddaughter named Sally, born in 1927, who was sickly. Her mother Dorothy, wife of Daniel, would make by hand a diet of strained fruits and vegetables for her as a pediatrician had recommended. After getting tired of this she suggested to her husband that if his company could make tomato puree perhaps they could make strained peas. 
Daniel then suggested to his father that they should look into making baby food. Gerber experimented with test batches of strained baby food on baby Sally and other babies in the summer of 1927. Gerber also researched marketing possibilities. 
Gerber began selling baby food through the canning company in 1928, using the "Gerber Baby" as their logo symbol. The baby food was sold at fifteen cents each, much less than similar foods which were purchased through drug stores for forty to sixty cents.
Some twelve years later the baby food line was outselling the adult canned food products. The name was changed to Gerber Products Company in 1941, and in 1943 Gerber stopped making canned foods for adults.
Later life.
Gerber died in 1952 and the firm was taken over by his son, Daniel Frank Gerber.

Daniel Frank Gerber

Daniel Frank Gerber (May 6, 1898 – March 16, 1974) was an American manufacturer of baby food.
Early life.
Gerber went by the name "Dan" to his friends and relatives. He was born in Fremont of Newaygo County, Michigan, in 1898, the son of Frank Daniel Gerber and Pauline Dora Platt.
Mid-life.
Gerber was educated at St. John's Northwestern Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin. He attended the academy from 1913 to 1916. Gerber served in the army during World War I. He then attended the Babson College of business administration from 1919 to 1920 for a year. Later in 1920 he hired in at Fremont Canning Company that his father owned. He was a successful manager and by 1926 he had become assistant general manager of the company. 
Gerber began urging his father to begin the production of strained baby foods at the cannery in 1927. Daniel and his wife Dorothy had an ill baby called Sally. Dan's wife suggested that he persuade his father to begin making and selling at their canning company strained baby foods. Gerber with his father did some extensive research on this new concept. They contacted nutritional experts, distributed many samples, and conducted market research interviews before launching their product. The idea of strained baby foods was not entirely new, but the long held American tradition was that babies generally were given a liquid diet until they were about a year old. It was risky to introduce this new concept to the marketplace as they had no idea how mothers would react to this new idea.
In 1928 their canning company started an advertising campaign in "Good Housekeeping", "Parents Magazine", the "Journal of the American Medical Association", and other magazines. Their task was to convince parents to adopt new feeding concepts. The campaign worked and into the 1930s the canning company expanded its baby food lines.
Later life.
In the 1950s the company that Gerber was now running, since his father died in 1952, added three new plants. One in Asheville, North Carolina; one in Rochester, New York; and another in Niagara Falls, Ontario. 
Gerber expanded and diversified the company. He added a toy line in 1955 and had the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1956 for the first time. He also opened a Mexican subsidiary in 1959. In 1965 he added a large line of baby-related products. 
At Gerber's death in 1974 the company claimed it was the world's largest baby-food manufacturer.

Jamali Kamboh

Shaikh Jamali Kamboh (Shaikh Jamal-uddin Kamboh Dehlwi, also known as "Shaikh Hamid bin Fazlullah", "Dervish Jamali Kamboh Dehlwi", "Shaikh Jamal-uddin Kamboh Dehlwi" or "Jalal Khan" etc. ) was a 16th-century poet and Sufi of the Suhrawardiyya sect, pupil of Poet Jami and of Shaikh Sama'al-Din Kamboh 
Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb are situated in Mehrauli Archeological Park, close to the Qutb Minar.
Biography.
Jamali came from a Sunni family of Kamboh lineage but was initiated into Sufism by the respected teacher Hazrat Shaikh Sama'al-Din Kamboh. He was the tutor of Sultan Sikandar Lodhi and had married the daughter of Hazrat Shaikh Sama'al-Din Kamboh. He lived at Mehrauli during the reign of Sultan Sikandar Lodhi (reign 1489 AD-1517 AD) and later composed panegyrics to the first of the Mughal emperor, Babur (b. 1483, d. 1530 AD) and his successor Humayun. 
Jamali Kamboh was a poet at the court of Sultan Sikandar Lodhi. The Sultan who himself was a poet ("he wrote poetry under the pen-name Gulrukh") patronized learning and literary acquisitions and used to show his poetry to Shaikh Jamali Kamboh for corrections and improvement.
As a poet of Persian language, Shaikh Jamall Kamboh had been styled "Khusrau-i-sani" ("Khusrau, the second"). He wrote "Siyar-l-Arifin" (completed between AD 1530 and 1536) in Persian which is an account of the "Chishti and Suhrawardi Sufis" of the period. He also authored other important works called "Masnawi", " Mihr wa Mähi Shaikh" and a "Diwan" of verses. 
Shaikh had once admonished Sultan Sikandar Lodi for his shaven chins and for his failure to observe the obligatory prayers, fasts and for his mundane indulgences.
Jamali Kamboh died in 1536 AD while accompanying the Mughal emperor Humayun in the latter’s expedition to Gujarat. His tomb and a mosque, known as "Jamali-Kamali", is situated near the Qutab Minar opposite the Ahinsa Sthal on Mehrauli's bypass. HIs son Shaikh Gadai Kamboh, a famous scholar and philosopher, was also his disciple and successor.

Klaus Urbanczyk

Klaus Urbanczyk, nicknamed "Banne", born 4 June 1940 in Halle (Saale), is a former East German football player and manager.
Urbanczyk began his football career at Turbine Halle in 1948. Beginning in 1960, he played for this team – in the meantime renamed Chemie Halle and later Hallescher FC Chemie – in the DDR-Oberliga. His first Oberliga match was against Wismut Karl-Marx-Stadt on 20 March 1960, as a right midfielder. During his career, however, he made his home on the position of right defender. He appeared in 250 East German top flight matches (12 goals).
At the beginning of the 1960s, Urbanczyk was held to be one of the best right defenders in the world, on account of his speed and his slide-tackling skills. He played for East Germany between 1961 and 1969.
In a survey among managers of the magazine "Deutsches Sportecho", Urbanczyk was voted the best right defender of the 1962–63 season. At the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964, Urbanczyk's popularity rose further. He was one of the key figures of East Germany's team (representing the United Team of Germany) that reached the semi-final of the tournament. In the semi-final against the Czechoslovakia, Urbanczyk collided with his own goalkeeper Jürgen Heinsch and suffered a complicated knee injury, including torn cruciates. East Germany lost the semi-final, but won the bronze medal against Egypt. 
In the same year, Urbanczyk won the East German Sportsperson of the Year award – the only team that a footballer was given an individual award. Urbanczyk also won the East German Footballer of the Year award in 1964.
In 1971, Urbanczyk was part of the HFC Chemie team that fell victim to a hotel fire while staying in Eindhoven for a UEFA Cup tie. Urbanczyk rescued several people and suffered severe injuries.
After ending his active career, Urbanczyk enjoyed success managing several Oberliga clubs, starting at HFC Chemie, then FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt. From 1976 to 1982 he was manager of 1. FC Magdeburg, winning the FDGB-Pokal in 1978 and 1979. His team was represented in the European competitions in every season, reaching the quarter-finals three times. After managing several other clubs, he returned to his home club in 1992, now called Hallescher FC, to manage them until 1994. Later, he enjoyed a small measure of success at FSV Lok Altmark Stendal who he guided to the DFB-Pokal quarter-final in 1995.

François Altwies

François Altwies (11 November 1869 – 5 July 1936) was a Luxembourgian politician. He sat in the Chamber of Deputies, of which he served as President from 1917 until 1925.
Altwies was a lawyer by profession, and was appointed notary in Junglinster in 1897, before holding that office in Luxembourg City from 1922. He was first elected to the Chamber in 1911, representing the canton of Grevenmacher. A conservative, Altwies joined the Party of the Right (PD) upon its formation in 1914. He was reelected in 1915 and 1918.
An eloquent and prominent member, Altwies became, along with Emile Prüm, Joseph Bech, and Auguste Thorn, one of the PD's main weapons on the floor of the Chamber. He became Vice-President of the Chamber on 28 June 1917 when Léon Kauffman, a fellow PD member, became Prime Minister. Only four months later, he was elevated to President, in which capacity he remained until 1925, when the Party of the Right lost their overall majority in the Chamber (the only spell in the era of proportional representation in which any party has held it).
Altwies played a key role in putting down the attempted communist revolution led by Émile Servais in January 1919, calling upon French soldiers to intervene in the crisis. When proportional representation was introduced, in 1919, he moved to representing "Centre", for which he was returned again in 1925 and 1931. He was appointed a Councillor of State in 1933. He died on 5 July 1936 in Luxembourg City.
He married Elise Wurth (1879–1966) on 21 May 1901. They lived together on the "maison de maître" of Luxembourg City's prestigious Boulevard Royal.
Decorations.
Altwies was awarded the following national decorations:

Schedule chicken

Schedule chicken is a concept described in project management and software development circles. The condition occurs when two or more working groups claim they can deliver features at an unrealistically early date, because each assumes the other teams are stretching the predictions. This pretense continually moves forward past one project checkpoint to the next until feature integration begins or just before the functionality is actually due.
The practice of schedule chicken often results in contagious schedules slips due to the inner team dependencies and is difficult to identify and resolve, as it is in the best interest of each team not to be the first bearer of bad news. The psychological drivers underlining the "Schedule Chicken" behavior are related to the Hawk-Dove or Snowdrift model of conflict used by players in game theory.
The term derives from the game of chicken played between drivers, as depicted in the movie Rebel Without a Cause, in which two drivers race their hot-rods towards a cliff edge. The first driver to jump out of the car is labeled a "chicken," while the one closest to the edge wins bragging rights.

The Buil Film Awards is a South Korean film awards ceremony hosted by the "Busan Ilbo" newspaper. It began in 1958 as one of the earliest film awards in the country. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was the biggest film awards event in the Busan region, and was held annually until 1973. The event went into a 34-year hiatus from 1973 to 2007 when the film industry lost its appeal due to government censorship and the burgeoning television industry. 
After an absence of 23 years, the awards were revived when the 17th Buil Film Awards took place on October 9, 2008 at the Grand Hotel in Haeundae-gu, Busan. It is currently one of the highlights of the ongoing Busan International Film Festival.

Apodemius

Apodemius (died 361) was an officer of the Roman Empire, a courtier of Emperor Constantius II, involved in the deaths of Constantius Gallus and Claudius Silvanus.
Biography.
Apodemius was an "agens in rebus", a sort of secret agent, who worked for emperor Constantius II (337–361).
In 350, Constantius ordered Apodemius and Barbatio to go to Poetovio, arrest his cousin and caesar of the East Constantius Gallus and bring him to Pula, where trial awaited him. When Constantius ordered Gallus to be put to death for treason, Apodemius, Serenianus and the "notarius" Pentadius executed the sentence; immediately after, Apodemius grabbed Gallus' shoes, rode quickly from Pula to Mediolanum, where the imperial court was seated, entered the chamber where Constantius was having a meeting and threw the shoes at the feet of the Emperor to signify Gallus' death.
When the "magister militum" Claudius Silvanus rebelled in Gaul, in 355, Apodemius was sent with letters to summon Silvanus to the presence of Constantius. Contemporary historian Ammianus Marcellinus tells:
In 361 Constantius II died; his successor was Julian, half-brother of Constantius Gallus. The new emperor instituted the Chalcedon tribunal to bring to trial the officers of Constantius II, in particular their involvement in Gallus' fall and death. Apodemius, who by the time had already returned to private life, was found guilty of having plotted against Gallus and put to death.
Contemporary historian Ammianus Marcellinus, who throughout his "Roman History" criticizes the courtiers of Constantius for their bad influence on the Emperor and for their numberless plots, has a bad opinion of Apodemius, of whom he says that "as long as he lived had been a fiery instigator of disturbances" and that "was a persevering and bitter enemy to all good men".

First Houses

First Houses is a public housing project in Manhattan in New York City and the first such in the United States. First Houses were designated a New York City and National Historic Landmark in 1974. They are managed by the New York City Housing Authority.
Description.
The project consists of 122 three-room or four-room apartments in 8 four-story or five-story buildings, and is located on the south side of East 3rd Street between First Avenue and Avenue A, and on the east side of Avenue A between East 2nd and East 3rd Streets. 
History.
First Houses take their name from their distinction of being the first public housing units constructed in the United States, opening for the first tenants on December 3, 1935. Victorian-era tenements existed on the site before they were cleared to build the project, which was also the very first project undertaken by the city's new Housing Authority, which completed it in 1936.
The project was planned as a gut rehab, with every third tenement building torn down to provide extra light and air, but architect Frederick L. Ackerman and his engineers soon discovered that the 19th century tenements were too fragile to be reconstructed. So they were torn down and First Houses was built from scratch, with a small number of the original foundation supports being used. The project employed re-used bricks and dozens of workers on relief paid for by the federal government. Ackerman designed the apartment buildings with rear entrances and courtyards to allow more light and air than the existing tenements in the neighborhood, and the cobbled open areas behind the buildings provided playgrounds, trees, benches and sculptures for the tenants.
Although First Houses cost far more than anticipated, Housing Authority chairman Langdon Post said it was worth it. "In the first place ... it has taken the question of public housing out of the realm of debate and into the realm of fact. Second, it has established the Authority as an agency for the issuance of slum-clearance bonds. Both Vincent Astor and Bernard M. Baruch accepted the Authority’s bonds to cover payments for the land – the first such bonds ever issued. In the third place, it provided an opportunity to test the Authority’s power to condemn land for slum clearance – a test which we won. Fourth, in Mayor La Guardia’s words, it provided us with 'Boondoggling Exhibit A.'"
The test which the Housing Authority won was the right to exercise the powerful tool of eminent domain. An owner of two tenements on East 3rd Street contended that seizing his property, even with compensation, contravened the constitutions of the United States and New York State. The New York State Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state, ruled that the Housing Authority could seize private property with these words: "Whenever there arises, in the state, a condition of affairs holding a substantial menace to the public health, safety or general welfare, it becomes the duty of the government to apply whatever power is necessary and appropriate to check it."

Enbaqom

Abba 'Ěnbāqom (c.1470-c.1565) was a religious leader of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and translator and author, e.g., of the "Anqaṣa Amin". As Abbot at the leading monastery of Debre Libanos he became the Echage, the second highest eclessiastical office, as well as head of all Ethiopian monasteries, and often regarded as the most influential person in the Ethiopian Church.
Life and views.
Enbaqom was the baptismal name of the former Abu'l Fatḥ, who circa 1489 had immigrated from Muslim Yemen into Christian Ethiopia. His father was said to have been nobility, his mother Jewish. He arrived as a merchant trader, in the company of a returning Ethiopian who had been held captive in Yemen. Already Enbaqom was intensely involved in questioning his religious affiliation. Eventually, after much reading and discussion, he decided to convert and become a Christian. His teacher Petros, then Echage or Abbot of the leading Ethiopian monastery at Debre Libanos in Shewa, baptized him, giving him the name '"Ěnbāqom", the Ethiopian form of Habakkuk; while the Hebrew name signifies "savant", the Ethiopian has the connotation of "professor".
After further prayer and learning Enbaqom circa 1500 became a monk at Debre Libanos. By his study he acquired many languages, including: Arabic, Geez, Coptic, Hebrew, Syriac, Armenian, Portuguese, and Italian. Throughout his clerical life he worked to translate into Geez, the language of the Ethiopian Church, many Christian writings, e.g., John Chrysostom's Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the story from India of Barlaam and Josaphat. For his writings he won wide respect.
At the court of the Emperor Lebna Dengel, Enbaqom had become the friend of the Abuna Marqos, the chief ecclesiatic in Ethiopia. During this Emperor's reign Enbaqom became the Echage, i.e., the Abbot at the Debre Libanos monastery. While at court Enbaqom also met the Portuguese priest Francisco Álvares. Later this priest visited Enbaqom at the monastery, teaching him Portuguese and Latin. Álvares reports that in 1520 he was at Dabra Libanos when the Emperor Libna Dengel installed a new Echage: "He whom they made Ichee was also held to be a man of holy life, and he had been a Moor. As he was a great friend of mine, he told me all his life and said to me that when he was in his sect a Muslim he heard a revelation, which said to him: 'You are not following the right path; go to the Abima Marcos, who is head of the priests of Ethiopia, and he will teach you another path'. Then he came to the Abima Marcos, and related to him what he had heard, and the Abima Marcos had made him a Christian, and had taught him, and considered him as a son; and therefore the took this monk who had been a Moor for governor of this monastery... . This man had so much affection for me that he used not to leave me and always went about with me. [He also mastered the Portuguese language, so we both understood one another very well." Álvares says that the new Echage also knew how to write Latin in good style. This, of course, sounds like Enbaqom; yet Álvares gives his name as Jacob. Van Donzel, however, assures us that Enbaqom "is" this Jacob who Álvares describes in some detail. Accordingly at the death of Petros, Enbaqom had become the eleventh "Echage" at Dabra Libanos, which was the second highest office in the Ethiopian Church (after the Coptic Abuna).
Yet Enbaqom next entered a long period of turbulence. He was accused of disloyalty to the Emperor Lebna Dengel, then tried and, in lieu of death, banished. A year later the Emperor forgave and recalled him, but he did not return as Abbot. Instead, he withdrew further southeast to Warab by the headwaters of the river Awash. Then during the years 1526-1543 there came upon them very destructive raids led by the Muslim Ahmad Gran which destabilized the region and threatened the continued existence of Christian kingdom. During these decades of chaos and anarchy, Enbaqom kept on the move, relocating westward to Gafat then to Bizamo, both regions located south of the Abbay River or Blue Nile.
In 1532 the monastery at Debre Libanos had been torched, enveloped in flames due to the forces of Ahmad Gran. Enbaqom in that year sent a letter in Arabic addressed to Ahmad Gran, writing that he should stop destroying churches and monasteries (whose libraries held the literary history of the people), and that he should stop killing priests and monks. Ahmad Gran evidently replied in effect that as a Muslim he respected the Jewish Torah and the Christian Gospels, so he would not burn churches and would limit the killing to those who resist. Enbaqom's book in Geez "Anqasa Amin" grew out of this letter to Ahmad Gran.
Because of his unusual background, Enbaqom was better able to address Christian Ethiopians about certain ways to understand and resist Islam. From such a partisan point of view, he was in an "admirable position to meet their needs, and his presence was seen as providential. While Ahmad did all he could to capture and execute him, Enbaqom moved from place to place comforting the faithful."
The new Emperor Galawdewos returned Enbaqom to favor, making him his councilor in war. Perhaps too the learned Enbaqom influenced Galawdewos when he wrote his well-known "Confession of Faith" which diplomatically presents a theological and liturgical response to the Catholic Church. The next Emperor Menas allowed the monk to become the Echage again at Debre Libanos. A few years later Enbaqom would die.
Abba Enbaqom sought "to provide spiritual and intellectual leadership for the Ethiopian Church, and to translate works and ideas from the rest of Christendom, thus bringing a richer theology from abroad and higher standards of clerical education... ." The Ethiopian Church celebrates his life on the 21st of "miyazya" (corresponding to April 29) in the liturgical year.
Anqaṣa Amin.
His book "Anqasa Amin" ["Gateway of Faith"], written in Geez, was an expansion and scholarly development of his 1532 letter in Arabic to the Muslim invader Ahmad Gran. It is perhaps the only Ethiopian Church writing with so many quotations from and references to the Qur'an (Enbaqom relied on his memory for many of these). The book is polemical, however, and was never popular. The arguments employed by Enbaqom "seem mostly drawn from the standard Arab Christian responses to Islam." For example: Jesus in the Qur'an has greater stature than many Muslims will admit.
Enbaqom on occasion draws some interesting parallels. The Muslim Laylat al-Qadr ["night of power" or "night of decrees"] during Ramadan commemorates the first revelations of the Qur'an to Muhammad, when it is said that the angels and the Spirit will descend until dawn. For Enbaqom this refers to Noel, Christmas night, when the Deity came here to earth, the night of his birth, when bands of angels filled the sky singing, "Glory to God in the highest and peace to his people on earth!"
Enbaqom discusses the process of his own coverstion to Christianity, which began when he heard a passage from the Qur'an discussing Jesus in the divine plan.
Two original arguments made by Enbaqom have been noted. First, that the Qur'an relies on only one language, Arabic, and the Judaic scriptures on Hebrew with some Aramaic. The Christian Gospels, however, communicate effectively their spiritual message in many different languages. Second, the Qur'an and the Judaic scriptures give prescriptions for war and the like. Christian scriptures do not, but are addressed to the welfare of the poor.
The "Anqasa Amin" is an argumentative work, written in the midst of long-term and widespread chaos, destruction, and death. In it Enbaqom demonstrates familiarity with Christian doctrine and prior Christian polemics, and also with Muslim religious literature.

Billy Mitchell (video game player)

Billy L. Mitchell, (born July 16, 1965) is a video game player who is best known for recording high scores in classic video games from the Golden Age of Arcade Games. David Ramsey, writing in the "Oxford American", called Mitchell "probably the greatest arcade-video-game player of all time". His achievements include the first perfect score in "Pac-Man". He owns the Rickey's World Famous Restaurant chain, based in Hollywood, Florida. He uses the same brand to sell a line of hot sauces, Rickey's World Famous Sauces.
Biography.
Mitchell grew up in South Florida and began playing games at age 16. Already a dominant pinball player, he was at first uninterested in video games appearing in the early '80s until he noticed that "everyone was standing around the Donkey Kong machine and wanted attention".
Mitchell attended Chaminade Catholic High School in 1983 and soon began work as a manager in the kitchen of his parents' restaurant, "Rickey's World Famous Restaurant". Mitchell assumed ownership of the Rickey's chain in the mid-1980s, continuing to own and manage it as of 2009. In the mid '90s, Mitchell had a short stint as a video game tester at Crystal Dynamics, in Menlo Park, California.
Mitchell is known for his mullet haircut and wearing neckties showing American patriotism during game competitions. The ties stem from his 1999 race to become the first person to achieve a perfect game of "Pac-Man". One of his competitors, Rick Fothergill, wore a Canadian flag cape and called himself "Captain Canada". Mitchell began wearing his patriotic ties in response.
Mitchell is also the brother of Karen Harrington, a South Florida Republican politician that has run two unsuccessful Congressional campaigns (2010 and 2012) to replace Debbie Wasserman Schultz in the United States House of Representatives.
Video game career.
"The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters".
The 2007 documentary "" tells the story of newcomer Steve Wiebe's attempt to surpass Billy Mitchell's high score at the game "Donkey Kong", which Mitchell had set in 1982.
Mitchell is never shown playing the game in the film, though he states the importance of playing in public, saying, "To me, most important is to travel to a sanctioned location, like Funspot that makes it official; if tomorrow Tiger Woods golfs a 59, big deal. If he does it at Augusta, that's where it counts." However, throughout the film Wiebe traveled to various locations such as Funspot and even Mitchell's home town to play him publicly, and each time Mitchell refused. More controversy arose when at Funspot, Wiebe set the Donkey Kong live score record and was given official recognition, something he did not receive for sending in a tape in which he scored the first million point game on record. A few hours later, a tape submitted by Mitchell in which he scored over a million points was accepted, and Wiebe lost his record. In Mitchell's hometown later on, Wiebe waited for four days to play Mitchell, who showed up one day and refused to play against Wiebe. In the film, Wiebe, while playing the game says hello to Mitchell, who does not respond, and says to his wife, as he walks away, "There's certain people I don't want to spend too much time with." Mitchell offers no explanation for his behavior towards Wiebe but later explained that at the time of filming, he had not played video games for "more than a year", and that the filmmakers had not given him enough advance warning to train for a public record-breaking attempt. Seth Gordon, the film's director, in referring to Mitchell's character says that Mitchell "is a true puppet-master", "a master of information-control" and that there was a lot of "stuff we couldn't include because of inter-state telephone rules."
At the film's conclusion, Wiebe beats Mitchell's score to gain a new "Donkey Kong" record on tape to claim both the live and taped records.
After "King of Kong".
On July 26, 2007, on the 25th anniversary of Mitchell's first record-setting performance, Mitchell again played in public and retook the Donkey Kong record with a score of 1,050,200, though that score was surpassed on February 26, 2010 by Hank Chien, who was temporarily the record holder at Donkey Kong. However, Mitchell reclaimed his title once again on July 24, 2010. On September 20, 2010, Steve Wiebe once again took the title with a score of 1,064,500. As of February 27, 2011, Hank Chien re-took the record with a score of 1,090,400.
Honors.
On January 14, 1984, he was selected as one of the 1983 "Video Game Players of the Year" by Twin Galaxies and the U.S. National Video Game Team.
On September 17, 1999, he was proclaimed the "Video Game Player of the Century" while at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show. In a ceremony on the Namco stage, company founder Masaya Nakamura presented Mitchell with an award commemorating the first "perfect" game on "Pac-Man".
On November 24, 1999, he offered $100,000 to the first person who could get through "Pac-Man"'s "split-screen level".
On June 21, 2006, MTV selected Mitchell one of "The 10 Most Influential Video Gamers of All Time." He was also nominated as leader of the Nerd Herd.
Mitchell placed eighth in the Microsoft Xbox 360 "Pac-Man" World Championships on June 4, 2007.
In 2008, Mitchell became the first video game player to be honored with a Topps Allen & Ginter trading card.

After the outbreak of World War II, his regiment sailed for Palestine, where one of Smiley's first jobs was to shoot his troop of 40 horses when it became clear they were of no use in modern combat.
In 1940 Smiley joined the Somaliland Camel Corps, but was to arrive at Berbera the same day it was decided to evacuate British Somaliland. He returned frustrated to Egypt where he persuaded family friend General Wavell to recommend him for the newly formed commandos. Smiley was appointed a company commander (with the rank of captain) with 52 Commando and his first mission was sneaking from Sudan into Abyssinia.
He fought against Vichy French forces in Syria. For his reconnaissance work in ruins near Palmyra he was mentioned in despatches (Middle-East, 1941).
Smiley was recruited by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) 1943 and undertook his first operation with them in Palestine in the same year. Later in the year he parachuted into Greece for another operation.

He was British Military Attaché to Stockholm between 1955 and 1958.
After the war, he held the record for the most falls in one season on the Cresta Run in St Moritz; bizarrely, he represented Kenya (where he owned a farm) in the Commonwealth Winter Games of 1960.
He was Commander of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's Armed Forces between 1958 and 1961.
He was Military Advisor to Yemen between 1962 and 1967.
Later work.
Smiley was the author of three books based on his experiences, "Arabian Assignment", "Albanian Assignment" and "Irregular Regular".

International Missionary Society

The International Missionary Society of Seventh-Day Adventist Church Reform Movement is a Protestant Christian denomination, part of the Sabbatarian adventist movement. 
Its first members were former Seventh-day Adventist who had been disfellowshipped during World War I for their “unchristian conduct” in openly opposing leaders of the church for supporting the war and committing its young men to the battlefield, weapons in hand. The original Adventist Movement had come out of the greatest religious awakening and revival since apostolic times (1814-1844), but it was not until the American Civil War (1861-1865) that expedience demanded it organize as a distinct denomination.
Note the official statement: 
“The denomination of Christians calling themselves Seventh-day Adventist, taking the Bible as their rule of faith and practice are unanimous in their views that its teachings are contrary to the spirit and practice of war, hence they have ever been conscientiously opposed to bearing arms.” Letter to Austin Blair, Governor of Michigan, August 3, 1864, (Signed) John Byington, J. N. Loughborough, Geo. W. Amadon, General Conference Committee.
Exactly fifty years later however, a change took place as church leaders in Europe, under the political pressures of World War I, yielded to government demands and committed its young men to military service. Here, in part, is their official statement – note the change in position:
"Most honorable Lord General and Minister of War, August 4, 1914:
"…While we stand on the fundamentals of the Holy Scriptures, and seek to fulfill the precepts of Christendom, keeping the Rest Day (Saturday) that God established in the beginning, by endeavoring to put aside all work on that day, still in these times of stress, we have bound ourselves together in defense of the 'Fatherland,' and under these circum-stances we will also bear arms on Saturday (Sabbath)….” (Signed) “H. F. Schubert, President”
Shortly after the above official statement was made to the government, approximately 2% of Adventist members in more than 14 European countries were disfellowshipped from the church for their open opposition to war and their support of pacifism. In some countries, entire congregations and their elders, within just one week, found themselves deprived of church membership because of their stand on the war question and the Sabbath.
After the war, while hoping to reconciliation with former brethren, they found it necessary to organized in order to legally hold their collective recourses and support disfellowshipped ministers and workers. Since many had been members of the International Missionary and Tract Society of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, they originally organized in 1919 in Germany as 'Internationale Missionnsgesellshaft der Siebententags Adventisten Alte seit 1844' (International Missionary Society of Seventh-day Adventists old movement standing firm since 1844). When all efforts failed in both 1920 and 1922 to reintegrate on issues related to non-participation in war, and when they discovered that a reform movement within the church had been prophesied, the latter part of the original name was changed to Reform Movement. Thus the name: International Missionary Society Seventh-day Adventist Church Reform Movement.
In July 1925, brief, basic Principles of Faith were formally compiled by representatives from around the world during a Reform Movement General Conference meeting in Gotha, Germany. With new enthusiasm, the Reform Movement spread rapidly into many countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.
Then, in April 1936, the German government closed down and confiscated all property belonging to the International Missionary Society, whose members subsequently suffered persecution, imprisonment, exile, loss of property and even death: many leaders and young men of the International Missionary Society died as martyrs in concentration camps, some having been denounced and even betrayed by members and even leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
After World War II, the Reform Movement again grew rapidly around the world. But during General Conference delegates’ meetings held in Holland, on May 21, 1951, the acting Secretary of the General Conference, Dimitru Nicolici, a Romanian-born Australian, objected to certain procedures imposed by the outgoing President Carlos Kozel, and while the meeting was in session he left the assembly with 10 other delegates and an interpreter. Within a few days, this group set up their own separate organization with Nicolici as president and retained the name of the 1949 U.S. registration, which had eliminated the name International Missionary Society. In 1952 Testimony from eyewitnesses to this incident and official delegates’ minutes are on record. Attempts to reintegrate that movement failed in 1952, 1968, and 1993.
There are now two distinct branches of the Reform Movement as a result of the 1951 split. One uses the name "Seventh-Day Adventist Reform Movement" (sometimes referred to as the Nicolici group), whereas the other uses the name "Seventh-Day Adventist Church Reform Movement." Both have entirely different organizations, personnel, and website presence. The General Conference of the former can be found at www.sdarm.org (they are headquartered in Roanoke, VA), whereas the General Conference of the latter can be found at www.sda1844.org (they are headquartered in Cedartown, GA).
The organizational structure of the International Missionary Society follows the original pattern of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. There are churches, mission fields, districts, fields, unions, and the General Conference. The highest governing body of the denomination, the General Conference Assembly, is composed of delegates from around the globe, meets in full session once every 5 years to elect a 15-member governing Board, to study doctrinal issues, and to establish missionary priorities. The most recent such Assembly was held in 2007 in Mexico.
The International Missionary Society is represented in more than 100 countries. Its adherents worship on the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday) and believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. The organization holds the Bible to be inerrant and acknowledges the published writings of Ellen G. White to be part of the Spirit of Prophecy (inspired writings) for the last days.
Points of difference with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, besides conscientious objection to war, include the view that abortion and homosexuality violate God’s will, a refusal to participate in political activity, the upholding of the marriage institution as sacred to God, a refusal to participate in ecumenism and labor unions, and advocacy of health principles such as vegetarianism and natural healing while abstaining from harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.
They do not divide into different churches on the basis of language, ethnic, or racial differences. They have a strong family, education, health, and missions emphasis in their projects, funding, and resource allocation.
The international headquarters facility in Cedartown, Georgia, U.S.A., was purchased in 2007 and is staffed by ministers, doctors, teachers, and missionaries from a broad base of countries.
Membership: The International Missionary Society Seventh-day Adventist Church Reform Movement numbers approximately 30,000 members worldwide with more than 73,000 congregants attending church services on the weekly Sabbath day.
Periodicals: The Sabbath Watchman is the official publication of the International Missionary Society Seventh-Day Adventist Church Reform Movement, General Conference.
Beliefs
The Church places much importance on their name, historical roots, and Adventist doctrines.

Mojib-Ribbon

Whereas in "Vib-Ribbon" the gameplay centered on the player's interaction with the melody of the song being played, in "Mojib-Ribbon" the gameplay centers on the player's interaction with the lyrics. As such, the music employed in the game is heavily lyrics-oriented rap music. The game's art-style is centered on traditional sumi-e and Japanese kana calligraphy. This has led to claims that the game is incomprehensible to non-Japanese audiences, however the simplicity of gameplay have allowed numerous import gamers (typically also fans of Masaya Matsuura's oeuvre) to enjoy the game as well, and guides exist online regarding menu navigation instructions for non-Japanese speakers.
Gameplay.
In "Mojib-Ribbon", the player plays the part of (a name similar to that of Vibri from "Vib-Ribbon"), a character drawn in the sumi-e style who wishes to become a famous rapper (similar to "PaRappa the Rapper") and to find the truest rap of them all. In each level, Mojibri walks around a circle of clouds as rap lyrics written in kana pass underneath. The player must press up on the joystick to get Mojibri to dip his fude in the suzuri and then down to get Mojibri to write the kana as he sings it. The songs are heavily rhythm-based raps, and the player must time the application of the fude to the washi during lyrics and to the suzuri during breaks.
Later in the game Mojibri is joined by a female friend named and a huge robot called . These characters have individual calligraphy styles.

Palazzo Rosso (Genoa)

Palazzo Rosso is a historical palace of Genoa, northern Italy.
Situated in Via Garibaldi, it is one of the most important picture galleries of the city, along with the galleries of Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Doria Tursi.
Palazzo Rosso was designed by the architect Pietro Antonio Corradi and was built between 1671 and 1677. 
The Brignole Sale family owned the palace until 1874, when Maria Brignole Sale, duchess of Galliera, bequeathed it to the city of Genoa, in order to "increase its artistic splendor and practical resources". The palace then became municipal property and it was destined to become a public gallery.
The collection.
The portraits donated by the duchess of Galliera constituted the first nucleus of the collection, which today consists of the works of artists like Van Dyck, Guido Reni, Paolo Veronese, Guercino, Gregorio De Ferrari, Albrecht Dürer, Bernardo Strozzi, Mattia Preti.

Domestic violence court

Specialized domestic violence courts are designed to improve victim safety and enhance defendant accountability. They emerged as a problem-solving court in the 1980s and 1990s in response to frustration among victim advocates, judges and attorneys who saw the same litigants cycling through the justice system again and again.
Background on domestic violence.
The FBI estimates that a domestic violence crime is committed at a rate of once every fifteen seconds. According to conservative estimates, one million women are battered by an intimate partner annually. These numbers and the efforts of domestic violence advocates have led, over the last 20 years, to changes in the criminal justice response to such offenses. Some of the greatest changes occurred in the 1990s, with the passage of the federal Violence Against Women Act. 
This increased attention to domestic violence resulted in, among other things, the passage of mandatory arrest laws, an increase in funding for services for victims, and the creation of special domestic violence prosecution and police units. At the same time, there was a parallel movement taking place within state court systems as judges and attorneys began to search for new tools, strategies, and new technologies that could help them address difficult cases where social, human, and legal problems collide.
New York’s chief judge, Judith S. Kaye, articulated, with co-author Judge Susan Knipps, the thinking behind the development of domestic violence courts in an essay published in Western State University Law Review: “One possible judicial response to the current situation is to continue to process domestic violence cases as any other kind of case, and to continue to observe systemic failures. Another response, however—the problem solving response—is to try to design court programs that explicitly take into account the special characteristics that domestic violence cases present. If domestic violence defendants present a particular risk of future violence, then why not enhance monitoring efforts to deter such actions? If victims remain in abusive situations due to fear for their own and their children’s well being, then why not provide links to services and safety planning that may expand the choices available to them? If cases are slipping between the cracks of a fragmented criminal justice system, then why not work together to improve coordination and consistency?” 
Today, there are nearly 300 courts nationwide that have special processing mechanisms for domestic violence cases. Three sites were the subject of a study by the Vera Institute of Justice: Milwaukee County, Wisconsin; Washtenaw County, Michigan; and Dorchester District in Boston, Massachusetts. Starting in 1999, judges and attorneys, advocates for women and batterer intervention specialists, probation officers, police, and others in those jurisdictions banded together in an ambitious effort to improve criminal justice and community responses to domestic violence. The three sites were selected to participate in the Judicial Oversight Demonstration Initiative—a national demonstration project funded by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women—have spent the past five years working to enhance victim safety and the oversight of offenders in their communities.
The Center for Court Innovation is funded by the Office on Violence Against Women to provide technical assistance to courts interested in developing or enhancing their domestic violence programs. The Center for Court Innovation also has a grant from the National Institute of Justice to document the number and types of domestic violence courts in the U.S.
Benefits of domestic violence courts.
Justice system practitioners, victim advocates, and researchers have cited the following major benefits of domestic violence courts:
Concerns about domestic violence courts.
Susan Keilitz notes a number of concerns about domestic violence courts. The need for judges to specialize, for instance, may lead to a loss of neutrality among judges or “the assignment of judges who are not motivated to acquire the knowledge and skills required to be effective in these cases, or to loss of judicial effectiveness from the stress of fast-paced decisionmaking in difficult and emotionally charged cases every day.” Another concern is that greater efficiency in prosecution may lead to “assembly-line justice that ignores the special needs of victims,” Keilitz wrote.
Domestic violence courts in New York.
In New York, the typical domestic violence court features a single presiding judge, a fixed prosecutorial team, and enhanced staffing to monitor defendant compliance and provide assistance to victims. In order to ensure compliance with court orders, New York’s first domestic violence court, the Brooklyn Felony Domestic Violence Court, launched in 1996, instituted a procedure that required parolees to come back to the court for a formal review of the terms of their order of protection. There are now over 35 domestic violence courts in New York, including courts in the Bronx, Queens and Westchester Counties, the city of Buffalo, and smaller cities like Clarkstown and Binghamton. An impact evaluation of 24 New York domestic violence courts found reduced re-arrests among convicted offenders. New York State has also created integrated domestic violence courts where a single judge handles criminal domestic violence cases and related family issues, such as custody, visitation, civil protection orders and matrimonial actions. In addition, the New York court system has three Youthful Offender Domestic Violence Courts that work with teenage defendants.

Wheeler Bryson Lipes

In September 1942, Wheeler Lipes performed an emergency appendectomy aboard a United States Navy submarine. Although he did not have proper medical equipment or formal surgical training, the operation was a success.
Notoriety.
In September 1942, aboard USS "Seadragon," Pharmacist's Mate Wheeler B. Lipes performed the first major surgery aboard a submarine when a shipmate showing symptoms of acute appendicitis required an emergency operation to survive. Positioned in enemy waters and lacking standard medical equipment, Lipes performed a successful appendectomy using kitchen instruments such as spoons and tea strainers. "Doc" Lipes, as he was called, had no formal surgical training and just three years of medical experience as a hospital lab technician at the time of the surgery.
Popular Media.
On December 14, 1942, the "Chicago Daily News" published an article by George Weller which told Wheeler B. Lipes' story. It won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Reporting. The events documented in the piece were incorporated into the film "Destination Tokyo" (1943) starring Cary Grant.
Recognition.
Wheeler B. Lipes eventually received official recognition for his feat over 60 years after the submarine surgery. He was awarded a Navy Commendation Medal at a ceremony at Camp Lejeune, N.C.

<doc id="20450200" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20450200" title="Pre-hospital trauma assessment">
Pre-hospital trauma assessment

Pre-hospital trauma assessment is a set of skills used by emergency medical services technicians to analyze all threats to life that a patient could suffer due to a trauma incident. Pre-hospital trauma assessment is broken into two major types: basic trauma assessment and advanced trauma assessment. The basic assessment is provided by first responders and EMTs. The advanced assessment is provided by a paramedic.
Scene size-up.
Approaching and sizing up a trauma incident scene is one of the most important primary steps that a pre-hospital care provider carefully does. Within a critical trauma incident, seeing hazardous material and traffic in an uncontrolled environment is expected. These factors can cause life-threats for providers, coworkers, and bystanders. Therefore, controlling all these life-threats is initially accomplished even before patient contact.
After scene management, a pre-hospital care provider gets a general impression of the scene. A general impression is discovered by evaluating the mechanism of injury. For example, in a car accident, mechanism of injury is detected by estimating the speed at which the collision occurred, looking at the amount of damage, and looking for other factors that may affect the mechanism of injury, such as airbag deployment.
This general impression helps the provider to make some important decisions regarding the number and type of transport units needed, and also helps to determine how critical a patient is.
Scene size-up consists of several steps which may be performed in different orders dependent upon circumstance:
Critical to the scene size-up is the need for quick decisions to be made. In the absence of hazards delaying progress, such decisions should be made by the time the patient is reached.
Initial assessment.
The initial assessment for trauma patients does not differ from medical patient assessment. The primary outcome of the initial assessment is to determine any "immediate life threats".
The first step in performing an initial assessment is forming a general impression - is this patient "sick", "not sick", or "not sure". Taking steps to immobilize the patient's head to prevent any or any further injury to the spine, the level of consciousness is assessed according to the AVPU criteria - Alert, responds to Verbal stimuli, responds to Pain stimuli, Unresponsive.
After checking the level of responsiveness, ABC is checked. ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation. In a trauma patient, sometimes the airway gets blocked due to facial injury or foreign body objects. According to Sanders, a patent airway should be maintained by positioning the patient properly, removing all blocking objects and carefully positioning the head using jaw-thrust technique.
The next step after maintaining a patent airway is checking breathing rate and quality. If the patient is breathing less than 8 times/minute or shallow more than 35/minutes, the patient then needs somebody to breathe for him using a valve mask attached to a high flow oxygen source.
Then, checking the pulse comes as the third step. For unresponsive adult patients, checking pulse is performed by palpating the carotid artery in the neck. For infants and small children, the pulse is usually assessed in the brachial artery in the upper arm. After confirming that the pulse is present, the final step in the initial assessment for a trauma patient is to check for any gross bleeding and to control it. Should a pulse not be detected, or in the case of a child or infant is present but at a rate less than 60, cardiovascular resuscitation will be commenced.
Steps:
Focused history and physical examination.
In a critical trauma incident, more than one provider is needed to be available to perform an assessment on one patient. After the initial assessment, one of the providers checks vital signs and looks for any information about the patient's medical history. Other providers work on physically examining the patient to look for any life threats or other problems that can be fixed while en route to the hospital. A rapid head-to-toe exam is performed to look for any deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures, burns, tenderness, swelling, and lacerations. If none of these are life-threats, they are ignored on scene and then begin immobilizing the patient on a long spine board.
The initial assessment, primary survey, and immobilization of the patient do not take more than ten minutes to achieve.
Steps:
Obtain Baseline Vital Signs
Obtain SAMPLE History
Ongoing assessment.
The en route assessment starts when the patient is loaded in the ambulance. En route assessment begins with a repeat of the initial assessment and ensuring that the patient still has a patent airway, breathes or is being properly ventilated, and has a pulse.

National Day of Listening

The National Day of Listening is an unofficial day of observance where Americans are encouraged to set aside time to record the stories of their families, friends, and local communities. It was first launched by the national oral history project StoryCorps in 2008 and now recurs on the Friday after Thanksgiving Day, when families are more likely to spend time together. It was proposed as an alternative to "Black Friday", a day many businesses see as a high volume pre-Christmas sale day.
Tens of thousands of Americans interviewed one another as part of the National Day of Listening in 2008 including President George W. Bush and his wife Laura, who were interviewed by President Bush's sister Dorothy Bush Koch.[http://www.npr.org/about/press/2008/112408.NationalDayListening.htmlNational Public Radio personalities including Scott Simon, Liane Hansen, Steve Inskeep, Renée Montagne, Frank Deford, Susan Stamberg, and Noah Adams also conducted National Day of Listening interviews and broadcast them on the air.

U.S. Route 20 in Indiana

U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Indiana is a main east–west highway that is parallel to the Indiana Toll Road. The western terminus of US 20 is at the Illinois state line and the eastern terminus is at the Ohio state line. US 20 through Whiting, East Chicago, and Gary is concurrent with US 12 twice. The route varies between one-way, two-lane, and four-lane streets, in northwestern Indiana. From the east side of Gary to west of South Bend, US 20 is a four-lane undivided highway. The route then heads around the west and south sides of South Bend and Elkhart as a four-lane limited access divided highway. East of Elkhart County Road 17 (CR 17), US 20 is two-lane rural highway.
US 20 was part of the Dunes Highway from the Illinois state line to Michigan City, concurrent with US 12. The Dunes Highway started being paved in 1922. The section of the highway, that is known as Lincoln Way as part of the 1913 section of the Lincoln Highway. Indiana State Highway Commission, later renamed Indiana Deportment of Transportation, began signing US 20 in 1926. US 20 went through downtown South Bend and Elkhart before the St. Joseph Valley Parkway was built. Before the parkway was completed, the route that was open to traffic was called Bypass US 20. A small realignment in LaGrange County was done in 2005, in which the roadway was straightened. Other small realignments included the route through Michigan City, which followed US 35 from US 12 to I-94.
Route description.
Only the segment of US 20 that is concurrent with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway are included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other U.S. Routes in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 3,390 vehicles and 1,090 commercial vehicles used the highway daily near the Ohio state line. The peak traffic volumes were 36,040 vehicles and 731 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of US 20 concurrent with SR 331.
Illinois to South Bend.
US 20 enters Indiana concurrenct with US 12 and US 41, at which point it passes under the Indiana Toll Road. The road passes by both commercial and industrial areas, between Wolf Lake and Horseshoe Casino. US 12, US 20, and US 41 are concurrent until US 41 turns south on Calumet Avenue. US 12 and US 20 head southeast toward East Chicago; in East Chicago, US 12 turns east and US 20 continues south. US 20 meets State Road 312 (SR 312) and passes under the Indiana Toll Road. US 20 turns left onto Michigan Street and heads east to Gary passing both industrial and residential. On the way to Gary, US 20 has an interchange with SR 912; at the interchange, the road name changes to 5th Avenue. Just west of Gary, US 12 and US 20 have a concurrency.
US 12 and US 20 are concurrent through most of Gary. From Bridge Street to Vermont Street, the eastbound traffic of US 12/US 20 is on 5th Avenue and westbound traffic is on 4th Avenue. East of downtown Gary, the eastbound and westbound lanes merge to form the Dunes Highway. Before reaching the neighborhoods of northeastern Gary, the Dunes Highway has an interchange with Interstate 65 (I-65) and I-90/Indiana Toll Road.
Shortly thereafter, US 12 leaves to the northeast toward Michigan City and US 20 heads east then northeast, forming a major retail corridor through the neighborhoods of Aetna and Miller Beach. The route meets SR 51 at the northern terminus of SR 51, near the boundary between Lake Station and Gary. Just west of Portage, the road passes under I-94. In Portage, the route has intersections with both SR 249 and SR 149. The road now enters Burns Harbor and has interchanges with I-94 and SR 49, just south of the Indiana Dunes. The route heads northeast until Town of Pines, where it intersects with SR 520. After Pines, the route heads due east to US 421 in Michigan City.
From US 421, the route heads east and then northeast around Michigan City. On the east side of Michigan City the route has an interchange with both SR 212 and I-94 followed by an intersection with the northern terminus of US 35. After US 35, the route becomes a four-lane undivided highway until Rolling Prairie, passing SR 39 at Springville. East of Rolling Prairie the route meets SR 2. US 20 heads northeast and then east and SR 2 heads due east. The route passes through Hudson Lake and New Carlisle before South Bend.
South Bend to Ohio.
On the west side of South Bend, US 20 heads onto the St. Joseph Valley Parkway continuing due south. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway runs along the west side of South Bend. The route turns due east having a cloverleaf interchange with US 31, just south of downtown South Bend. On the south side of Mishawaka, US 20 has a concurrency with SR 331. The road has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 33 near Dunlap. The interchange with Old US 20 is incomplete with no access to westbound Old US 20 from eastbound US 20. Soon after the interchange with Old US 20 is an interchange with CR 17. This exit is also the end of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway.
US 20 heads east from Elkhart towards Middlebury, having an intersection with SR 15 south of Bristol. At this intersection the road is a four-lane undivided highway, and soon after the intersection the road becomes a two-lane highway. The route passes through the southwest side of Middlebury. On the south side of Middlebury the route has a traffic light at SR 13. The route becomes a four-lane divided highway just west of this intersection, and soon after the intersection the road becomes a two-lane highway. From Middlebury, the route heads east towards Lagrange, passing through rural farmland in eastern Elkhart County and western Lagrang County. On the way to Lagrange the route passes through an intersection with SR 5 just south of Shipshewana. The route heads east towards downtown Lagrange, having an intersection with SR 9. The route heads east through rural farmland in eastern LaGrange County and western Steuben County. The route enters Angola and has an interchange with I-69. The road enters downtown Angola and passes just north of Trine University. The road heads towards downtown and a roundabout with SR 127 (Old US 27). After going through the east side of Angola, the route leaves Angola heading east towards Ohio. In rural eastern Steuben County, the route passes through farmland and has an intersection with the northern terminus of SR 1. Just west of the Ohio state line the route passes under the Indiana Toll Road (I-80/I-90).
History.
An important road from 1900 to 1910 was the Old Chicago Road, later renamed the Dunes Highway. The Dunes Highway Association engineers envisioned the Dunes Highway a "state of the art" concrete highway with a right-of-way. In August 1919, Commission director H.L. Wright tentatively designated the Dunes Highway as State Road 43, to be wide. Narrower than anticipated, the new concrete highway was still superior to most Indiana roads, which in the mid-1920s were gravel or dirt with paved sections only between the larger towns. Dunes Highway construction began in 1922 under the guidance of Gary contractor Ingwald Moe and construction engineer Ezra Sensibar.
US 20 was part of the first alignment of the Lincoln Highway in 1913 from the current SR 2 in Rolling Prairie to Elkhart, where the Lincoln Highway turned southeast on to current US 33. In 1926, the Lincoln highway was rerouted to US 30.
Between 1917 and 1926 the route from Illinois state Line to Michigan City was SR 43; this route was named Dunes Highway. At this time, US 20 from Michigan City to Ohio state line was SR 25. When US 20 was signed in Indiana, in 1926, the section from Illinois state line to Michigan City was concurrent with US 12 and the Dunes Highway. In the early 1930s US 20 from the Illinois state line to Michigan City was moved to its current route. In the mid-1970s Bypass US 20 (BYP US 20) went from US 31 to US 20, on the southwest side of South Bend. Until 1998, US 20 went through downtown Elkhart and South Bend. When the State of Indiana built the St. Joseph Valley Parkway, the route downtown was decommissioned.
In 2005 a series of sharp curves around Rainbow Lake were removed; the curves were located six miles west of Lagrange. A new straight roadway was built, from just east of SR 5 to just east of Lagrange County Road 600 West.
Future.
The Indiana Department of Transportation plans to make US 20 a four-lane highway with a center turn lane from the east end of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway to SR 13. The project will be done in three different phases. Phase one will be from Elkhart County Road 17 to SR 15, phase two will be from SR 15 to Elkhart County Road 35, and phase three will be from CR 35 to SR 13. The final phase is schedule for completion around 2020.

Joose (framework)

Joose is an open-source self-hosting meta object system for JavaScript with support for classes, inheritance, mixins, traits and aspect-oriented programming.
The Joose meta-object system is multi-paradigm. It supports class-based and prototype-based programming styles as well as class-based inheritance and role-based extension. While other JavaScript frameworks often specialize on DOM-access and AJAX, Joose specializes solely on bringing successful programming techniques to the JavaScript scripting language. Joose is thus often used in conjunction with another DOM/Ajax JavaScript framework and is tested with jQuery, YUI, Dojo, ExtJS, Prototype, Mootools and PureMVC.
Joose was heavily inspired by Moose, the object system for Perl 5 which was itself inspired by Perl 6 object system, but unlike Perl and Moose, Joose doesn't support multiple inheritance.
Example.
Two classes written in Joose:
Point3D is a subclass of Point. It has another attribute defined and additional code to run after running the superclass clear() method. The "rw" means the attribute is readable and writable with a pair of get/set accessors generated automatically.

<doc id="20450288" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20450288" title="Ermengarde of Anjou (d. 1146)">
Ermengarde of Anjou (d. 1146)

Ermengarde of Anjou (ca. 1068 – 1 June 1146) was a member of the comital House of Anjou and by her two marriages was successively Duchess of Aquitaine and Brittany. Also, she was a patron of Fontevraud Abbey. Ermengarde was the regent of Brittany during the absence of her spouse from 1096 until 1101.
Life.
Early years.
Born in Angers she was the eldest child of Count Fulk IV of Anjou but the only one born by his first wife, Hildegarde of Beaugency. Having lost her mother in 1070, at only two years of age, she received a good education and grew to be pious and concerned about religious reform, especially the struggle against the secular appropriation of church property. She was also noted for her beauty in her youth.
Duchess of Aquitaine.
It has long been presumed that, in 1089, her marriage was arranged to the young Duke and poet, William IX of Aquitaine. However, this union proved a dismal failure. Her husband was a voracious philanderer, whose affairs infuriated his wife. She suffered from severe mood swings, vacillating between vivacity and sullenness, and would nag her husband. She also had a habit of retiring in bad temper to a cloister after an argument, cutting off all contact with the outside world, before suddenly making a reappearance in the court as if her absence had never occurred. Such behavior, coupled with her failure to conceive a child, led William to send her back to her father and have the marriage dissolved in 1091. 
Her behavior during her marriage to the Duke has been described by both Marion Meade and Alison Weir as schizophrenic, with Weir adding a suggestion of manic depression.
However, Ruth Harvey's 1993 critical investigation shows the assumption of William's marriage to Ermengarde to be based largely on an error in a nineteenth-century secondary source and it is highly likely that Philippa of Toulouse was William's only wife. Further research has found the claim that William was married to "Hermingerda", daughter of Fulk IV of Anjou is based on the very unreliable chronicle of William of Tyre, written between 1169 and 1187, more than 70 years after the events in question would have taken place. Tyre erroneously identifies Ermengarde's mother as Bertrad of Montfort, the sister of Amalricus de Montfort when her mother was in fact Audearde or Hildegarde of Beaugency. Tyre's chronicle lacks any contemporary corroboration, no primary text ever mentions a marriage between William and Ermengarde. It is therefore not only improbable that William married Ermengarde, it is likely that Ermengarde - at least as a wife of William - never existed.
Duchess Consort and Regent of Brittany.
In 1093, her father married her to Duke Alan IV of Brittany, probably to secure an alliance against Normandy, then controlled by William the Conqueror’s son, Robert Curthose. The union produced three children: Conan (later Duke Conan III of Brittany), Havise (wife of Baldwin VII of Flanders, who repudiated her in 1110) and Geoffrey (who died young in Jerusalem in 1116).
Her husband left for Palestine in 1096 to take part in the First Crusade and she served as Regent of the Duchy from then until 1101. She spent little time in Rennes or the west of Brittany, preferring Nantes and the Saumur region. Influenced by Robert of Arbrissel, she approved the expansion of the abbey at Fontevraud, to which she withdrew on two occasions. An admirer of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (to whose abbey she made donations), she favored the creation of Cistercian abbeys. She was also a benefactor of the monastery of Buzay, near Nantes.
Alan IV, an unpopular ruler, was forced to abdicated in favor of his son in 1112, and he and Ermengarde were separated after this.
Later years.
By 1116 Ermengarde was living in Fontevrault Abbey, where she reputedly became a friend of her first husband's second wife, Philippa of Toulouse. 
In 1118 after the death of Philippa, Ermengarde decided to avenge her deceased friend. She went south from Fontevrault to the court of her former husband, Duke William of Aquitaine, where she demanded to be recognized as the rightful Duchess. William ignored this remarkable request. Accordingly, in October 1119, she suddenly appeared at the Council of Reims, being held by Pope Calixtus II, demanding that the Pope excommunicate William, oust his mistress from the ducal palace, and restore Ermengarde to her rightful place as the Duchess of Aquitaine. The Pope ""declined to accommodate her""; however, Ermengarde continued to trouble William for several years afterwards.
Death.
Ermengarde at one point went on Crusade to Palestine; she returned ten years later, and some historians believe her life ended in Jerusalem at the convent of Saint Anne. But obituary lists at Redon Abbey record a date of death in 1146 in Redon where her second husband, Alan IV was buried. It is believed that she died a nun. The contradictions about her death and the records of her burial maybe indicated that in fact she died in Jerusalem, and that her body was subsequently transferred to Redon.

Attack.
On November 28, 2008 the ship was carrying palm oil in the Gulf of Aden and was hijacked by Somali pirates. The attack took place within the Maritime Security Patrol Area and is attributed to six pirates armed with AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades in a high-speed skiff. The ship is the 97th to be hijacked off the coast of Somalia in 2008. In addition to the three security guards who escaped by jumping into the sea, 25 Indian and two Bangladeshi are members of the crew.
The two British and one Irish guard, are employed by British-based security company Anti Piracy Maritime Security Solutions (APMSS), of Poole, Dorset. All three are military-trained, two being former marines and one a former paratrooper, and were "... on board the vessel to provide logistical support and non-lethal defensive counter-measures." according to Andrew Mwangura, coordinator of the East African Seafarers Assistance Program.
Unarmed, the security guards attempted to repel the attackers for about 40 minutes by firing water cannon, zigzagging the skiff, and using a LRAD, a non-lethal weapon that fires focused sound beams producing excruciating pain. A distress signal was received at 0447 hours UTC by the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Centre, in Kuala Lumpur. After the pirates boarded the ship and continued to shoot at the security force, the guards managed to escape by jumping overboard. They were rescued from the sea by a German navy helicopter, and taken first to the French light monitoring frigate "Nivôse" before being transferred to the "Jean de Vienne", a F70 type anti-submarine frigate of the French "Marine Nationale". 
The incident caused the usefulness of LRADs to be called into question by Lloyd's List.
The vessel was finally released on 24 January 2009 thanks to the efforts of Capt Satya Sahoo and his team from Ishima and the owners ISEC. All crew of the vessel at the time of its release are reported as being in good health.

British Bakeries is the bread making arm of Rank Hovis McDougall, manufacturing Hovis, Nimble and Mothers Pride as well as supermarket's own brand bread for shops such as Tesco and Asda. British Bakeries parent company is Premier Foods. British Bakeries had two factories in Bradford, one in Thornbury and one on Thornton Road, which closed recently as well as further factories in Kingston upon Hull, []] and Wigan.
Redundancy controversy.
The closure of British Bakeries factory on Thornton Road in Bradford was justified by the relatively small size of the factory, compared to its counterpart at the other side of town, as well as other factories, as well as the £6 million repair quote for the roof. 70 staff were made redundant, including many apprentices, who received completion of their training as part of their redundancy package. The move was highly criticised by Trade Unions. However, no industrial action was taken.

Tumefactive multiple sclerosis

Tumefactive multiple sclerosis is a condition in which the central nervous system of a person has multiple demyelinating lesions with atypical characteristics for those of standard multiple sclerosis (MS). It is called tumefactive as the lesions are "tumor-like" and they mimic tumors clinically, radiologically and sometimes pathologically.
These atypical lesion characteristics include a large intracranial lesion of size greater than 2.0 cm with a mass effect, edema and an open ring enhancement. A mass effect is the effect of a mass on its surroundings, for example, exerting pressure on the surrounding brain matter. Edema is the build-up of fluid within the brain tissue. Usually, the ring enhancement is directed toward the cortical surface. The tumefactive lesion may mimic a malignant glioma or cerebral abscess causing complications during the diagnosis of tumefactive MS. T2-hypointense rim and incomplete ring enhancement of the lesions on post-gadolinium T1- weighted imaging on brain MRI enable accurate diagnosis of TDL
Tumefactive multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating and inflammatory disease. Myelination of the axons are highly important for signalling as this improves the speed of conduction of action potentials from one axon to the next. This is done through the formation of high-resistance, low-conductance myelin sheaths around the axons by specific cells called oligodendrocytes. As such, the demyelination process affects the communication between neurons and this consequently affects the neural pathways they control. Depending on where the demyelination takes place and its severity, patients with tumefactive MS have different clinical symptoms.
Prevalence.
Approximately 2 million people in the world suffer from multiple sclerosis and of those, more than 400,000 are from the United States Tumefactive multiple sclerosis cases make up 1 to 2 of every 1000 multiple sclerosis cases. Of those cases, there is a higher percentage of females affected than males. The median age of onset is 37 years.
According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, there are some factors that have been associated with an increased risk of MS. They include gender, ethnicity and geographic location. Based on epidemiological studies, there are about 3 times more female MS patients than male patients, indicating a possibility of an increased risk due to hormones. Among different ethnic groups, MS is the most common among Caucasians and seems to have a greater incidence at latitudes above 40° as compared to at the equator. While these associations have been made, it is still unclear how they result in an increased risk of MS onset.
Genetic factors.
Studies have shown that genetic factors play a role in the increased frequency of MS in the relatives of MS patients. However, identification of the genes that are involved has not been accomplished due to the small sample size. Generally, genes involved in the immune system are over-expressed and they implicate T-helper cell differentiation. T-helper cells are involved in the activation of T-cells which are responsible for entering the central nervous system and initiating demyelination processes.
Clinical signs and symptoms.
Initial symptoms of MS consist of both sensory and motor symptoms. According to Kidd, motor symptoms develop first followed by the sensory symptoms. The more common symptoms include spasticity, visual loss, difficulty in walking and paresthesia which is a feeling of tickling or numbness of the skin, commonly described as “pins and needles”. Symptoms of tumefactive MS often mimic a variety of other diseases including ischemic stroke, peroneal nerve palsy and intracranial neurologic disease. Subjects have been reported to suffer from a decreased motor control resulting in a ‘foot drop’, or significantly reduced leg movement. In other cases closer mimicking strokes, subjects may suffer from confusion, dizziness, and weakness in one side of the face. Symptoms also can mimic a neoplasm with symptoms such as headaches, aphasia, and/ or seizures.
Spasticity.
Spasticity is usually the result of upper motor neuron syndrome which is caused by demyelination or inflammation in the motor areas of the brain or the spinal cord. This syndrome is when motor control of skeletal muscles is affected due to damage to the efferent motor pathways. Spasticity is an involuntary muscle movement like an exaggerated stretch reflex, which is when a muscle overcompensates and contracts too much in response to the muscle being stretched. It is believed that spasticity is the result of the lack of inhibitory control on the muscles, an effect of neuronal damage. The upper motor neuron syndrome also includes weakness in the limbs which usually starts with the muscles at the hip and thigh thus affecting running, walking and jumping. Arm muscles usually weaken after leg muscles. Some signs of weakening include loss of dexterity and stiffness of the intrinsic hand muscles.
Visual loss.
Visual loss or disturbances are a result of inflammation of the optic nerve, known as optic neuritis. The effects of optic neuritis can be loss of color perception and worsening vision. Vision loss usually starts off centrally in one eye and may lead to complete loss of vision after a period of time.
Cognitive dysfunction.
MS patients may show signs of cognitive impairment where there is a reduction in the speed of information processing, a weaker short-term memory and a difficulty in learning new concepts. This cognitive impairment is associated with the loss of brain tissue, known as brain atrophy which is a result of the demyelination process in MS.
Fatigue.
Most MS patients experience fatigue and this could be a direct result of the disease, depression or sleep disturbances due to MS. It is not clearly understood how MS results in physical fatigue but it is known that the repetitive usage of the same neural pathways results in nerve fiber fatigue that could cause neurological symptoms. Such repeated usage of neural pathways include continuous reading which may result in temporary vision failure.
Pathology.
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune response and the breach of the blood-brain barrier by inflammatory molecules cause the demyelinating process. T lymphocytes or T-cells, involved in the immune system, are activated by binding to a specific antigen. Upon activation, the T-cells are able to penetrate through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the central nervous system (CNS). The blood-brain barrier separates blood from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the CNS. It is made of endothelial cells tightly packed together, making the barrier selectively permeable to small molecules like carbon dioxide and oxygen. This barrier serves to protect the brain from bacterial infections. This breach of the BBB results in the increased permeability of the barrier to other inflammatory cells and macrophages. Peripheral cell-signalling molecules which enter the CNS through the BBB activate microglia cells, which protect the CNS by removing infectious agents, damaged neurons and plaques. Microglia cells behave like macrophages and it is believed that they are responsible for the production of the antigens that activate the T-cells and in the secretion of cytokines which may control inflammatory pathways. Subjects with tumefactive multiple sclerosis display elevated levels of choline (Cho)/creatine ratio and increased lactate which is associated with demylinating diseases. Cases also display oligo-clonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid.
As of today, the initiation process of demyelination is not clearly understood but it is believed to be receptor-mediated. These macrophages attach onto the myelin sheaths and degrade the myelin, leaving the axons demyelinated. During the process of demyelination, macrophages produce toxins like nitric oxide and enzymes which cause damage to the surrounding myelin sheaths.
These T-cells produce high levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) which have been shown to be toxic towards the oligodendrocytes and as such, the process of myelination is interrupted in addition to the demyelination that is occurring.
Diagnosis.
Diagnosis of tumefactive MS is commonly carried out using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton MR spectroscopy (H-MRS). Diagnosis is difficult as tumefactive MS may mimic the clinical and MRI characteristics of a glioma or a cerebral abscess. However, as compared to tumors and abscesses, tumefactive lesions have an open-ring enhancement as opposed to a complete ring enhancement. Even with this information, multiple imaging technologies have to be used together with biochemical tests for accurate diagnosis of tumefactive MS.
Tumefactive demyelination is distinguished from tumor by the presence of multiple lesions, absence of cortical involvement, and decrease in lesion size or detection of new lesions on serial imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MRI diagnosis is based on lesions that are disseminated in time and space, meaning that there are multiple episodes and consisting of more than one area. There are two kinds of MRI used in the diagnosis of tumefactive MS, T1-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging. Using T1-weighted imaging, the lesions are displayed with low signal intensity, meaning that the lesions appear darker than the rest of the brain. Using T2-weighted imaging, the lesions appear with high signal intensity, meaning that the lesions appear white and brighter than the rest of the brain. When T1-weighted imaging is contrast-enhanced through the addition of gadolinium, the open ring enhancement can be viewed as a white ring around the lesion. A more specific MRI, Fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI show the signal intensity of the brain. Subjects with tumefactive multiple sclerosis may see a reduction of diffusion of the white matter in the affected area of the brain.
Proton MR spectroscopy (H-MRS).
H-MRS identifies biochemical changes in the brain such as the quantity of metabolic products of neural tissue including choline, creatine, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), mobile lipids and lactic acid. When demyelination is occurring, there is breakdown of cell membranes resulting in an increase in the level of choline. NAA is specific to neurons and thus, a reduction in NAA concentration indicates neuronal or axonal dysfunction. As such, the levels of choline and NAA can be measured to determine if there is demyelination activity and inflammation in the brain. Usually, the ratio of choline to NAA is used.
Treatment.
Pharmacologic.
Disease-modifying Agents.
Pharmacologic treatments for MS include immunomodulators and immunosuppressants which reduce the frequency and severity of relapses by about 35% and reduce the lesion growth.
Interferon beta (IFN-beta).
IFN-beta is one of the first treatments available for MS and is an immunomodulator as it alters antigen presentation and affects the proliferation of T cells. As explained in the pathology of MS, the binding of an antigen to the T-cell results in its activation and passes through the BBB, allowing inflammatory cells and macrophages to enter the CNS and initiate demyelination. As such, IFN-beta has proven to decrease the rate of relapses.
The presence of neutralizing antibodies against IFN-beta in the body will oppose the activity of IFN-beta and thus, IFN-beta treatment will have no effect in certain individuals who produce those neutralizing antigens. There are many known side-effects of IFN-beta. They include flu-like symptoms, leukopenia and an increased levels of liver enzyme.
Glatiramer acetate.
Glatiramer acetate has proven to affect the differentiation of T-cells, by promoting the T-cells to become inflammatory suppressors as opposed to pro-inflammatory cells. Side effect symptoms are generally mild in nature. A reaction that involves flushing, shortness in breath, anxiety and rapid heartbeat has been reported soon after injection in up to 5% of patients (usually after injecting directly into a vein). These side effects subside within thirty minutes. Over time, a visible dent at the injection site can occur due to the local destruction of fat tissue. 
Mitoxantrone.
Mitoxantrone is an immunosuppressant drug and it prevents the proliferation of T-cells by inhibiting DNA repair proteins and DNA topoisomerase, which are vital in the DNA replication process before mitosis. However, mitoxantrone can cause damage to the heart and as such, it is usually administered to MS patients whose disease is at a rapidly progressive rate.
Corticosteroids.
Corticosteroids have immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties and are used in MS therapy as they restore the blood-brain barrier and induce cell death of T-cells.
Dietary supplementaion.
Vitamin D is believed to affect the growth and differentiation of macrophages and T cells and as such, is used as treatment for MS. Higher levels of vitamin D have also proven to reduce the risk of the onset of MS.
Treatment of symptoms.
Due to the wide range of symptoms experienced by patients with MS, the treatment for each MS patient varies depending on the extent of the symptoms.
Treatment of spasticity.
The treatment of spasticity ranges from physical activity to medication. Physical activity includes stretching, aerobic exercises and relaxation techniques. Currently, there is little understanding as to why these physical activities aid in relieving spasticity. Medical treatments include baclofen, diazepam and dantrolene which is a muscle-relaxant. Dantrolene has many side effects and as such, it is usually not the first choice in treatment of spasticity. The side effects include dizziness, nausea and weakness.
Treatment of fatigue.
Fatigue is a common symptom and affects the daily life of individuals with MS. Changes in lifestyle are usually recommended to reduce fatigue. These include taking frequent naps and implementing exercise. MS patients who smoke are also advised to stop. Pharmacological treatment include anti-depressants and caffeine. Aspirin has also been experimented with and from clinical trial data, MS patients preferred using aspirin as compared to the placebo in the test. One hypothesis is that aspirin has an effect on the hypothalamus and can affect the perception of fatigue through altering the release of neurotransmitters and the autonomic responses.
Treatment of cognitive dysfunction.
There are no approved drugs for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction, however, some treatments have shown an association with improvements in cognitive function. One such treatment is "Ginkgo biloba", is a herb commonly used by patients with Alzheimer's disease.

<doc id="20450539" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20450539" title="Hardy Dam">
Hardy Dam

Hardy Dam (or Hardy Hydroelectric Plant) is a dam and powerplant complex on the Muskegon River in Big Prairie Township, Newaygo County, Michigan. At the time of its completion, it was the largest earthen dam in North America east of the Mississippi, and is still the third largest earthen dam in the world and the largest east of the Mississippi River. Its impoundment forms a lake with over 50 miles of shoreline. The dam impounds a reservoir of 4,000 acres (1,618 ha) and is capable of producing 30,000 kilowatts of electricity.
History.
After considerable investigation and planning, the Hardy was built in 1931 under the direction of Edward M. Burd, and is named for George E. Hardy, a financial partner with Anton Hodenpyl. Hardy and Hodenpyl (who also had a dam named after him) oversaw the Commonwealth and Southern holding company that Consumers Energy, was part of from 1910 through the 1920s. It used the semi hydraulic method of construction.
Hardy was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on Dec. 1, 1997. The listing notes the Spanish Colonial architecture of the powerplant buildings, including the oil house, intake, dormitory and powerhouse.
Historical marker text.
"Constructed from 1929 to 1931, on a site once known as the Oxbow, the Hardy Hydroelectric Plant was built by Consumers Power Company. The plant was named for George Hardy, a partner in the firm that financed Consumers' projects from 1911 through 1928. The complex includes a Spanish Colonial Revival-style powerhouse and intake tower, an oil house, and a dormitory. It originally included four operator's houses on the eastern bank of the pond, which were Sears-Roebuck kit homes. Due to advancements in fossil fuel steam generating plants, this was the last conventional hydroelectric plant built by Consumers. The Hardy plant in listed in the National Register of Historic Places."
Recreation.
Approximately 2,000 campsites, several boat launches and a marina are located around the dam. The parks located on the impoundment lake of the Hardy Dam include, Newaygo County's Sandy Beach Park, Newaygo State Park, Mecosta County's Brower Park, and Big Prairie Township's Ox Bow Park and Big Bend Park.
The reservoir offers excellent fishing and a nature trail system regarded as one of the best. The three mile unpaved path parallels the Muskegon River and contains 26 different trees with identification plaques. The trail area is home to wild turkeys, grouse and bald eagles as well as beaver, mink and otter. Fishing includes salmon, steel head, rainbow trout, brown trout, walleye, bass, perch and other pan fish.
The Muskegon dam system.
The three dams, Rogers, Hardy, and Croton (all owned and operated by Consumers Energy), are operated in different modes but in concert give a net run of river effect on water flow. The Rogers itself has little or no impoundment and runs in run of river mode, passing through as much water as it receives. The Croton and Hardy work in concert. The Hardy, which has a larger capacity reservoir, larger turbines, and is upstream of the Croton, runs in full peaking mode, meaning that the river flow is impounded and used to generate electricity during peak demand periods. This causes wide fluctuations in water flows and reservoir levels, typically with low outflow during the night when power demand is lowest. Full peaking was once very common but because of the outflow fluctuations, is now less common. However, with the Croton immediately downstream, and with no river segment (the Croton impoundment stretches back to the Hardy outlet), it can be run in re-regulation mode, allowing a natural flow rate to exit. The Croton reservoir level fluctuates inversely with the Hardy, rising during the day and lowering at night. Since the Hardy reservoir is so large, its reservoir level fluctuates about in total, while the Croton reservoir fluctuates about . During the winter and spring runoff, the Hardy is allowed to fluctuate much more. It can be drawn down up to to meet winter power demand but is required to return to normal levels by the end of April each spring.
Together, the three dams of the Muskegon River (Rogers, Hardy and Croton) can generate about 45,500 kilowatts, with about 30,000 of that from Hardy, which is enough electricity to serve a community of nearly 23,000.

Matka-class missile boat

The Matka class is the NATO reporting name for a group of hydrofoil missile boats built for the Soviet Navy. The Soviet designation is "Project 206MR Vikhr".
Design.
These boats are the ultimate descendants of the Osa class missile boat and are a heavily modified version of the Turya class torpedo boat. There is only a single foil, the aft part of the hull hydroplanes at high speeds. They are air-conditioned and NBC-sealed. The SS-N-2 launchers are the same type as carried on the Project 61MR (“Mod-Kashin“) class destroyers. Despite initial reports that they were good seaboats, later information revealed that the Soviets regarded them as cramped inside and topheavy. Of thirteen planned ships, one was cancelled and another started but never completed. All were built in Leningrad.
After the breakup of the USSR, Russia discarded many and five went to Ukraine, one of which was later transferred to Georgia after a complete refurbishment.
Project 206.6.
R-44 serves as a developmental ship for the Black Sea fleet, and was the first vessel anywhere to carry the SS-N-25 “Switchblade” missile, in two quad-canisters. These were removed in 2000 but re-installed in 2003. In 1998, the SP-521 combat data system was installed. R-44 also has the AK-630М1-2 Roy CIWS which is two 30 mm gatling guns superimposed on each other, in place of the AK-630. More recently, the ship has been seen with no “Drum Tilt” radar and a large deckhouse between the bridge and mast.
Combat usage.
On 9 August 2008 during the 2008 South Ossetia war, several media outlets reported that "Tbilisi" had been sunk in a nighttime action, either by a SS-N-9 “Siren” (likely from a “Nanuchka” class ship) or a SS-N-12 “Sandbox” (from the Slava-class cruiser "Moskva") fired by the Russian navy, which was moving a flotilla into position to enforce a 50NM Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) around the Georgian navy’s main homeport of Poti.
The "Tbilisi" was in fact destroyed by Russian Airborne Troops on August 8th 2008 in Poti port. The ship lost at sea was most likely the Stenka class patrol boat P-21 "Giorgi Toreli". This would have appeared very similar on radar to a Matka-class vessel, having essentially the same hull and superstructure but different armament.
Ships.
A total of 12 boats were built for the Soviet Navy. A gun boat version without hydrofoils was offered for export.

The Missing Piece (book)

The Missing Piece is a children’s picture book by poet Shel Silverstein.
Plot.
The story centers on a circular animal-like creature that is missing a wedge-shaped piece of itself. It doesn’t like this, and sets out to find its missing piece, singing:
"Oh, I'm lookin' for my missin' piece" 
"I'm lookin' for my missin' piece" 
"Hi-dee-ho, here I go"
"lookin' for my missin' piece"
It starts out on a grand adventure searching for the perfect piece to complete itself, while singing and enjoying the scenery. But after the circle finally finds the exact-sized wedge that fits it, it begins to realize that it can no longer do the things it used to enjoy doing, like singing or rolling slowly enough to enjoy the company of a worm or butterfly. It decides that it was happier when searching for the missing piece than actually having it. So it gently puts the piece down, and continues searching happily.
Meow...
Sequel.
A sequel was published in 1981 entitled "The Missing Piece Meets The Big O", which is told from a Missing Piece's point of view.

The Book of Eli

The Book of Eli is a 2010 American post-apocalyptic neo-Western and action film directed by the Hughes brothers, written by Gary Whitta, and starring Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis, Ray Stevenson, and Jennifer Beals.
The story revolves around Eli, a nomad in a post-apocalyptic world, who is told by a voice to deliver his copy of a mysterious book to a safe location on the West Coast of the United States. The history of the post-war world is explained along the way, as is the importance of Eli's task. Filming began in February 2009 and took place in New Mexico. 
The film was released in theaters in January 2010. Alcon Entertainment financed and co-produced the film with Silver Pictures, while it was distributed by Warner Bros. in the US; international sales were handled by Summit Entertainment
Plot.
Thirty years after a nuclear apocalypse, Eli (Denzel Washington) travels on foot toward the west coast of the United States. Along the way, he demonstrates uncanny survival and fighting skills, hunting wildlife and swiftly defeating a group of highway bandits who try to ambush him. Searching for a source of water, he arrives in a ramshackle town built and overseen by Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie dreams of building more towns and controlling the people by using the power of a certain book. His henchmen scour the desolate landscape daily in search of it, but to no avail.
In the local town bar, Eli is set upon by a gang of bikers and he kills them all. Realizing Eli is a literate man like himself, Carnegie asks Eli to stay, although it is made clear the offer is non-negotiable. After Carnegie's blind mistress Claudia (Jennifer Beals) gives Eli some food and water, Carnegie orders Claudia's daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) to seduce Eli. Eli turns her down, but she discovers he has a book in his possession. Eli offers to share his food with her. Before they eat, though, he has her pray with him. The following day, Solara prays with her mother. Carnegie overhears them and realizes Solara's words may relate to the book he has been seeking. He forces Solara to tell him Eli was reading a book. When he asks what kind, she says she does not know, but forms a cross with her two index fingers. Carnegie realizes Eli has a copy of the Bible, the book he wants. Eli sneaks out of his room and goes to the store across the street, where he had earlier given the Engineer (Tom Waits) his portable music player to recharge the battery. 
Carnegie has his henchmen shoot at Eli, but the bullets seemingly just graze him, as if he is being protected. Eli shoots most of Carnegie's men and hits Carnegie in the leg with a shotgun blast. Solara leads Eli to the town's water supply, hoping she can accompany him on his travels. Eli traps her inside and continues on alone. Solara escapes and soon finds herself ambushed by two bandits who attempt to rape her, but Eli appears and kills them.
As they continue on, Eli explains to Solara his mission. According to Eli, his book is the last remaining copy of the Bible, as all other copies were intentionally destroyed following the nuclear war. He says he was led to the book by a voice in his head, which then directed him to travel westward to a place where it would be safe. The voice assured him that he would be protected on his journey. Thus, for the last thirty years he has been traveling west, guided by his faith.
Eventually, Eli and Solara investigate an isolated house. They fall into a hidden pit, but manage to allay the suspicions of the residents, Martha (Frances de la Tour) and George (Michael Gambon), who invite them in for tea. When Eli realizes that the couple are cannibals, they attempt to leave, but then Carnegie and his posse arrive. In the ensuing shootout, George, Martha and some of Carnegie's men are killed. Eli and Solara are captured. When Carnegie threatens to kill Solara, Eli gives him the Bible. Carnegie shoots him, and leaves him for dead.
Solara escapes and drives back to help Eli. Rather than chase her, Carnegie returns to the town since his sole remaining vehicle is running low on fuel. Solara picks up Eli. They drive until they reach the Golden Gate Bridge. They then row to Alcatraz, where they find a group intent on saving what they can of civilization. Eli tells the guards that he has a copy of the King James version of the Bible. Once inside, Eli, who is revealed to be blind, begins to dictate the Bible from memory to Lombardi (Malcolm McDowell), the leader of the group. 
Meanwhile, back in the town, Carnegie opens the locked Bible, but discovers that it is in Braille. He orders Claudia to read it to him, but she refuses. Carnegie's leg wound has become septic, and he realizes he is going to die. Order breaks down, and the residents start looting.
Eli dies, but not before he has finished reciting the Bible. The printing press at Alcatraz begins making copies of the new King James Bible. Lombardi places one on a bookshelf between the Torah and Tanakh on one side and the Qur'an on the other. Solara is offered sanctuary, but she chooses to head back home, taking with her Eli's possessions.
Production.
In May 2007, Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros. signed the Hughes brothers to direct "The Book of Eli", based on a script by Gary Whitta. The film is the brothers' first since "From Hell" in 2001. The script was subsequently rewritten by Anthony Peckham, and in September 2008, Denzel Washington was cast in the lead role. The following October, Gary Oldman was cast to star alongside Washington. Principal photography began in February 2009 and took place in New Mexico. Alcon Entertainment financed the film and co-produced with Silver Pictures.
The complex fight scenes were choreographed by Jeff Imada and feature the Filipino martial art of Kali. Denzel Washington trained for months with Dan Inosanto and Jeff Imada for the role.
Reception.
Box office.
The film was released in North America on January 15, 2010 in 3,111 theaters. It took in $11,672,970—$3,752 per theater, its opening day. By the end of its opening four-day holiday weekend it grossed $38,437,553—$12,355 per theater. It ranked number two, behind "Avatar". On its second weekend, it placed third with "Legion" taking its number two place and grossed $15,732,493—$5,057 per theater. By its third weekend it dropped down to number five and made $8,908,286—$2,897 per theater. The film has come to gross $94,835,059 in the United States and Canada, and $62,256,659 in other markets, with an estimated worldwide total of $157,091,718.
Critical reviews.
The film has received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 48% of 188 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.5 out of 10. The site's consensus is that "It's certainly uneven, and many viewers will find that its reach exceeds its grasp, but "The Book of Eli" finds the Hughes brothers injecting some fresh stylish fun into the kind of post-apocalyptic wasteland filmgoers have seen more than enough of lately." Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 53 based on 33 reviews.
Todd McCarthy of "Variety" predicted "this will not be one of ... Denzel Washington's bigger grossers." "Chicago Sun-Times" critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 of 4 stars and said of the film: "You won't be sorry you went. It grips your attention, and then at the end throws in several WTF! moments, which are a bonus." Reviewing the film for "The A.V. Club", Scott Tobias graded the film a B, and wrote "At a time when theaters are experiencing a glut of doomsday scenarios, the Hughes' ashen, bombed-out future world looks a little too familiar, no matter how crisply they present it. But the showdown between Washington and a deliciously hammy Oldman complicates the film's overt religiosity...". Owen Gleiberman of "Entertainment Weekly" gave the film a D, calling it "a ponderous dystopian bummer that might be described as "The Road Warrior" without car chases, or "The Road" without humanity. Despite this, the film has received a cult following."
Home media.
The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on May 31, 2010 in the UK and on June 15, 2010 in the United States and Canada. The DVD took the top spot on all three national home video market charts in its first week. It premiered No. 1 on "Home Media Magazine"'s Rental Chart, the Nielsen Videoscan Blu-ray chart, and the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert Sales Chart, where it outdistanced its nearest competitor in sales by a 3 to 1 margin.

History of The Weather Channel

The Weather Channel is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that focuses on national and international weather information, along with entertainment-based programs related to weather. The history of The Weather Channel, dates back to around 1980.
Prelaunch.
Prior to the channel's launch, the original concept for providing continuous weather reports to the public over television stations stretched as far back as the late 1950s and early 1960s on the varying incarnations of CATV. In those systems, which typically brought in up to a dozen stations to the viewer from across the region, twelve slots on a cable dial would often leave a few vacancies.
Early cable providers then devised a system where a single black and white camera, often one that was formerly used for local news after an upgrade, would be placed on a rotating pedestal, capturing various dials and gauges on different stations to which it would pan automatically and stay for a few seconds before moving on. The different stations featured the time, temperature, barometer, wind speed, wind direction, and wind chill factor. Slides with the day's complete forecast, brief news headlines and community events often drawn up by the station's art department rounded out the package. This was the same system as that used by the early Devotional Channels and for the Stations of the Cross during the Christmas season.
The Weather Channel itself was the brainchild of former WLS-TV Chicago chief meteorologist and "Good Morning America" forecaster John Coleman, who took his idea to Landmark's then-chief Frank Batten. A major part of the plan for the new network was that it would be able to provide localized weather information to its viewers. This was done through WeatherStar units located at each cable company's headend. These WeatherStars were able to insert local conditions, forecasts, and warnings over the national feed.
On July 18, 1980, The Weather Channel, Inc. was founded in Atlanta, Georgia.
The early years: May 1982–March 1986.
The Weather Channel began broadcasting on May 2, 1982. The channel reported the weather and other meteorological information for the United States as well as other countries and regions of the world. TWC originally gathered its national region forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its local forecasts from the National Weather Service's Weather Forecast Offices around the country.
The original Weather Star I model often interfered with the channel 2 signal at the cable headend; this was fixed with the upgrade to the Weather Star II in January 1984. The Weather Star III upgrade, which took place in early 1986, improved the hardware even more, and also added several extra forecast and observation features.
You Need Us: March 1986–January 1991.
In 1986, The Weather Channel unveiled its first major image campaign and slogan, "You Need Us For Everything You Do". A full one-minute lyrical theme was created, but rarely aired – the shorter version was more commonly seen; 1989 saw the introduction of a remix to the theme. Also in 1989, "Prime Time Tonight", a three-minute video cable guide that appeared eight times daily from 7:57 to 11:27 p.m. was introduced.
1990 saw the introduction of the first Weather Star 4000 models in a text-based system similar to the Weather Star III. In-STAR radar was introduced in June of that year, and graphical backgrounds were introduced in July, making TWC history by being the first STARs to generate graphics and the first to feature the TWC logo in the forecast. Also in 1990, The Weather Channel included snow condition reports at five minutes after the hour.
Weather You Can Always Turn To: March 1991–October 1996.
Largely considered the height of the classic TWC by enthusiasts, The Weather Channel underwent a major graphical revamp with the introduction of a new slogan, "Weather You Can Always Turn To", on March 6, 1991. Graphic elements included heavy use of gradients and the Caxton typeface. July 3 brought The Weather Channel Connection, a 1-900 service for obtaining weather information. Originally 1-900-288-8800, it moved to 1-900-WEATHER (or 1-900-932-8437) in 1992 and used its phone number as its name. On November 1, The Weather Channel filed for a trademark on TWC, a common shortening of the name that was even seen on air.
By 1993, 90% of cable households received The Weather Channel. On January 10, 1994, TWC placed an order for 1,000 Weather Star Jr units with Wegener Communications, which builds equipment for cable headends. The Star Jr. is a budget model in the Weather Star line.
1995 brought a variety of changes to TWC, setting the stage for more changes in 1996. Minor graphical tweaks were made. The Short Term Forecasts from the National Weather Service were introduced to Local Forecasts as the "Local Update" (which in turn destabilized flavor lineups and caused the discontinuation of narration). The 30-Day Outlook was discontinued by the National Weather Service (which required TWC to discontinue the product). New programs included the introductions of "WeatherScope" (top/bottom of the hour weather discussion) and a special on how weather affected Pearl Harbor on December 7. The music of Trammell Starks, used on Weatherscan and emergency cases since 2000, premiered at the end of the year. The Weather Channel ended the use of Trammell Starks music in early 2012.
Major modernization: October 1996–March 1998.
In two years, The Weather Channel changed dramatically. The first wave of change came in October 1996. A new slogan was introduced, "No Place on Earth Has Better Weather", heralded with a trio of humorous spots promoting the accuracy of TWC's weather coverage. Months later, The Weather Channel received its biggest overhaul since 1991. A newer, flatter logo, new graphics featuring rotating globes and compass points, and new music made for a total modernization of TWC's presentation. 1996 also saw the launch of weather.com, The Weather Channel's website. "Local on the 8s", a concept in which local forecasts aired at :08, :18, :28, :38, :48 and :58 after the hour, also made its debut. The first iteration of "Local on the 8s" was somewhat short-lived, only lasting until early 1998. However, the concept was revived in December 2001, and is still used by TWC to this day.
On May 22, 1996, Landmark Communications purchased a building at 300 Interstate North near the junction of Interstates 75 and 285 in Atlanta to house The Weather Channel's operations. TWC had been looking for new studios, and requirements included 18-foot ceilings. Improvements were made to bring the building up to code before TWC moved into its new headquarters at the end of 1996 (but it did not begin broadcasting from the facility until early 1997).
On October 30, the first use in commerce of the name Weather Star XL was marked; two years later, the XL would make its debut, the catalyst for top-to-bottom modernization of the local forecast segment. Throughout this time period, The Weather Channel would end up with their old logo on segments, and some specialty segments retained their Dan Chandler narration and/or old TWC logo into late 1997. By 1996, The Weather Channel reached 63 million homes, with 130,000 watching at one time.
On March 31, 1997, a new schedule was introduced in the form of a news wheel format. On August 25, 1997, the channel debuted a memorable advertising campaign, "The Front", created by ad agency TBWA Chiat/Day. The setting was something akin to a sports bar, but the major difference was that weather was the central focus. The slogan used with "The Front" was "Weather Fans, You're Not Alone." The 1997 World Series was the first that TWC covered with live reporters. New title bars were introduced for national segments on January 6, 1998.
The second wave of change: March 1998–June 2001.
In March 1998, TWC refreshed again, with extended variants of Akzidenz-Grotesk and footage of clouds at the core of the new identity. For the first time in the channel's history, there was no slogan or unifying theme. "WeatherScope" was replaced with the "Weather Center" brand, which essentially comprised The Weather Channel's entire 24-hour daily programming schedule at the time. There were three variations of "Weather Center": "Weather Center AM" in the morning, "Weather Center PM" during the evening hours, and a generic version simply known as "Weather Center" in the afternoon. April 1998 saw updates to "The Front" image campaign. One of the new advertisements specifically mentioned the 36-hour text forecasts (which, at the time, were still supplied by the National Weather Service), but heralded new Local Forecast graphics; the machine that produced those graphics, the IRIX-based Weather Star XL, came out later that year as the first new mainline STAR in eight years. Its capabilities were significantly more advanced than the 4000, with animated, high-quality output consistent with TWC's national graphics and new scalable icons; the icons would be used for eight years on TWC, but still remain on the Weather Star XLs still in service and on certain downloadable web widgets.
1999 brought the removal of the unpredictable-length Local Update on the Weather Star 4000, which stabilized flavor lineups. Also in 1999, Weatherscan Local, originally exclusive to Comcast systems, was launched. Weatherscan runs continuous weather information 24 hours a day. Cable operators could add optional packages featuring expanded weather information or specialty forecasts (such as golf, boat and beach, or marine weather) to their Weatherscan systems. That year featured the premiere of "Sky on Fire", a documentary on lightning, and the appointment of a new network president, Decker Anstrom. By 1999, The Weather Channel reached 70 million homes, or 98% of all cable households. It also provided radio forecasts to more than 250 radio stations and weather information to 52 newspapers. Between 1999 and 2000, TWC aired conditions reports from Mount Everest using battery-powered sensors.
In 2000, the channel introduced Vocal Local, which uses narration to read local forecast data, to its XL systems; while most cable operators added the Vocal Local feature, some did not employ it on their Weather Star XL units. Music was switched from quarterly to monthly playlists; as such, 2000 is considered the split between the "classic" TWC and "modern" TWC by several websites. "Atmospheres", a newsmagazine-style program, premiered on August 23 of that year. Also in 2000, The Weather Channel starting moving away from showing "Weather Center" 24 hours a day with the introduction of two morning programs: "Your Weather Today" and "First Outlook". "Your Weather Today" replaced "Weather Center AM" on weekdays, however "Weather Center AM" continued to air on weekends until early 2001.
In 2001, a major change occurred on Weatherscan. Local forecasts generated for each county by the National Weather Service were removed and replaced with TWC products. While the NWS forecasts were of high quality, the new TWC forecasts were generated for areas, beneficial to multi-county viewing zones served by one STAR. In May 2001, TWC launched "Rays Awareness", an initiative focused on sun safety, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and American Academy of Dermatology.
The "Live By It" era: June 2001–August 2005.
On June 25, 2001, The Weather Channel had its first relaunch in over three years. The local forecast and program intros were completely redesigned. In addition, a new slogan, "Live By It," was introduced. The slogan was heard on channel IDs and intros to programs. With the discontinuation of "Weather Center AM" and "PM", "Weather Center" was now a single general program rather than existing in three separate versions specific to the time of day, having been significantly pared down with the introduction of new programs such as "Evening Edition" and "Weekend Now".
The Weather Star XL received a refresh for the first time in September 2001. Changes included different colors on text boxes, a new cloud background, improved regional forecast and radar maps, and new title bars and fonts that, just like the previous version, matched the on-air graphics that were used by TWC at the time.
In April 2002, the TWC-compiled local forecasts introduced the previous year on Weatherscan replaced the National Weather Service forecasts on the WeatherStar systems. As NWS bulletins/warnings were included in the old forecasts, a Weather Bulletins page displays the applicable watches, warnings and advisories (on the 4000, The Weather Channel does send National Weather Service bulletins to appear in the text-based local forecast, as the 4000 does not feature the Weather Bulletins slide). TWC celebrated its 20th anniversary in May 2002; in honor of the event, the channel premiered a retrospective special, and a book was published by Harvard Business Press, "The Weather Channel: The Improbable Rise of a Media Phenomenon" (ISBN 978-1-57851-559-2), written by TWC founder Frank Batten and Jeffrey L. Cruikshank.
The first long-form programs debuted on The Weather Channel at the beginning of 2003, with "Storm Stories" being the first program that was not weather or a documentary-type special. Also in 2003, the "Live By It" campaign was refreshed slightly. Weatherscan received a new design in February and moved to a modern STAR platform, known as the IntelliStar. The FreeBSD-based IntelliStar is more flexible than the IRIX-based Star XL for updates. Plans to revive "The Front" as a weather discussion board were proposed and scrapped that year.
STAR systems were introduced and decommissioned during 2004. The IntelliStar systems were rolled out to The Weather Channel. The Weather Star III was also discontinued from service as it did not meet DTMF tone and weather warning regulations. In October 2004, the United States Postal Service and TWC teamed up to create stamps depicting clouds and an accompanying "Cloudscapes" educational campaign – aimed at kids in grades 3 through 5 – about reading clouds to tell of pending weather conditions sent to 200,000 educators around the U.S., unveiled at Boston, Massachusetts' Blue Hill Observatory.
In early 2005, The Weather Channel announced a major refresh – with its first new logo in nine years, a new slogan, and other new elements – would occur in August. The relaunch was part of a long-running effort aimed at reducing the network's dependence on "commodity" viewers (those looking for forecast information) and attracting what then-TWC president Patrick Scott calls "vitalists" (those with an active interest in weather) and "planners" using the channel to plan the week.
Bringing weather to life: August 2005–June 2008.
On August 15, 2005 at 5 a.m. Eastern Time, The Weather Channel underwent a total relaunch. A newer, simpler logo was introduced, as was a new slogan, "Bringing Weather to Life". More long-form programs were introduced. The refresh came with STAR graphic refreshes for the XL and IntelliStar, both receiving the new logo and a new cloud background; the XL also received new title bars.
2006 continued the expansion of long-form programs, such as the climate-focused "The Climate Code with Dr. Heidi Cullen" (later renamed "Forecast Earth") and "It Could Happen Tomorrow".
In May 2007, The Weather Channel celebrated 25 years on the air, the festivities included airing select past Weather Channel promotional campaigns and the inclusion of a special 25th anniversary logo during commercial breaks. On June 17 of that year, TWC entered into a content partnership with MSNBC that made the channel the exclusive weather content provider for its website, msnbc.com. On September 26, the channel launched a high-definition simulcast feed; it also introduced a major refresh for the IntelliStar, with new titles and backgrounds on October 23.
2008 started with uncertainty, as reports surfaced about on-camera meteorologist Bob Stokes sexually harassing fellow TWC meteorologist Hillary Andrews. Andrews filed a lawsuit in Cobb County district court against The Weather Channel alleging the abuse by Stokes (which included statements like "Will you lick my swizzle stick" and saying that TWC "covered it up"). In May, Andrews won the lawsuit and was awarded an undisclosed amount of money. During the proceedings, it was revealed that Stokes' co-anchor before Andrews, Melissa Barrington, was also harassed. At the same time, Landmark Communications announced it was selling most of its assets, including broadcast television stations, newspapers, The Weather Channel, and data center facilities.
Becoming an NBC-owned channel and transition to high-definition: June 2008–November 2013.
On June 2, 2008, The Weather Channel unveiled its first major modernization since 2005. New graphics and opening titles for every TWC program, a new IntelliStar lower display line with tabs (another first), and a full thrust into the channel's new studios were the results of a massive move to high definition. By August 12, the channel had stopped broadcasting its forecast programming from its old standard definition studios, which would eventually be converted into offices.
One month later, NBC Universal purchased the channel, weather.com, Weather Services International, a 30% stake in Canadian company Pelmorex, and miscellaneous other assets for $3.5 billion along with private equity firms The Blackstone Group and Bain Capital, from the family-owned Landmark Communications. Later, Landmark announced it was halting the sales of most of the other properties except for one newspaper; The Weather Channel was the only property sold by Landmark.
In November, like all NBC Universal properties, it joined the "Green is Universal" campaign for environmental awareness. The logo was turned green (normally done from master control on other networks) by sending an update to the IntelliStar to change the logo. Ironically, in the middle of "Green Week" (on November 20), The Weather Channel made major layoffs, described as cost synergies – three active on-camera meteorologists and one former one, the marketing department, the Road Crew (originally including Jeff Mielcarz, although Mielcarz later appeared on some weather.com video forecasts in December 2008), significant portions of the TWC Radio Network, and the "Forecast Earth"/environmental unit (however, certain portions of the "Forecast Earth" unit remain with TWC). The layoffs took effect on November 30 (The Weather Channel later stated it would air other environmental programs). With the shutdown of former competitor NBC Weather Plus, certain assets from Weather Plus (meteorologists and technology, specifically) have been rebranded as TWC assets with TWC-branded graphics. The NBC Weather Plus meteorologists continued to be based from NBC Universal headquarters at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, New York and appeared often on MSNBC until the 2009 closure of the entire division. TWC personalities and on-camera meteorologists, such as Jim Cantore and Mike Seidel, have appeared on NBC and MSNBC properties since the sale. One of the motives for the cuts was in order to aid a $500 billion budget cut at NBC Universal parent company General Electric; NBC Universal and CNBC also made cuts.
February 2009 started with layoffs of four OCMs at the channel; midway through the month, it was discovered by members to a TWC fan forum and a leak on the TWC media kit that The Weather Channel was shaking up the schedule radically, including canceling "Evening Edition", "", "Forecast Earth" and "Weekend Outlook", dramatically changing "Weather Center" and turning sections of it over to "Abrams & Bettes" – all between February 21 and March 1. It had already been announced that "Storm Stories" was to return as part of "Tornado Week", a seven-day event devoted to programs relating to tornadoes. The program changes were some of the most far-reaching since 2003, which saw the creation of programs such as "Day Planner" and "PM Edition". In March 2009, TWC personalities and programs dramatically ramped up use of Twitter – at the same time, other NBC Universal properties (especially MSNBC) did the same; programs now regularly feature viewer tweets.
On March 5, 2009, Geoffrey Darby was named Executive Vice President of Programming and Production. Under Darby, Abrams and Bettes were moved to "Your Weather Today"; "First Outlook" was shortened by one hour to make way for a new show "Wake Up With Al" featuring Al Roker; and the longstanding jazz music featured during the channel's local forecasts was removed and replaced with instrumental rock music at Darby's request; it was even confirmed by Chris Geith, the only remaining jazz artist in the playlists, that TWC had sent out a request for proposal to create production music branded with a common signature for the channel. TWC began showing weekly movies related to weather on Friday nights, beginning October 30, 2009; this caused criticism from many viewers and those in the media, who have criticized The Weather Channel for deviating from its format of running weather information 24 hours a day. The first film seen on TWC was "The Perfect Storm"; other films included "March of the Penguins" and "Misery". Showing movies on TWC was a move that was planned for some time, even before the acquisition by NBC. After December 2009, these weekly movies were discontinued for the time being in favor of running "Weather Center", which already aired throughout primetime during the rest of the work week. Despite the controversy, the channel relaunched the Friday night film block on March 26, 2010 with "Into Thin Air", only to drop films permanently in May 2010, due to viewer criticism that stemmed from both the broadcast of movies on a news and information channel and an incident during an April 2010 tornado outbreak in which a scheduled broadcast of the movie "Wind" aired instead of wall-to-wall severe weather coverage.
Since the acquisition by NBC, live programming such as "Your Weather Today" has featured live video from NBC-owned or affiliated stations, as well as live or videotaped field reports from news correspondents employed by the local NBC affiliate serving the area being covered.
In January 2011, TWC announced that Australian-born landscape photographer Peter Lik would be starring in a new half-hour action-adventure nature reality series titled "From the Edge with Peter Lik", which debuted on March 31. The program is produced by NBC's in-house production unit, Peacock Productions. Lik also serves as a special contributor for TWC, providing segments from his frequent travels to weather-impacted locales.
Later in 2011, the Intellistar 2, a high definition counterpart to the Intellistar, began to be gradually rolled out to cable providers across the country. The Intellistar 2 is shown on top of the high definition national feed during "Local on the 8s" segments; the original Intellistar is still utilized to provide weather information on The Weather Channel's standard definition feed. 
The Weather Channel marked the 30th anniversary of its launch in May 2012. In August 2012, former CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf joined TWC as a weather forecaster.
It's Amazing Out There: November 2013–present.
On November 12, 2013, The Weather Channel implemented a new graphics package on the Intellistar and IntelliStar 2 that closely resembles the graphical display of a mobile app. The LDL's display was also extended to commercial breaks (except for those locally inserted by cable providers) and long-form programming. In addition, "Weather Center Live" replaced "First Forecast", "Day Planner", "Weekend View" and "Weekend Now". The 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. weekday, as well as the 4 p.m., 7 p.m., 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. Eastern Time weekend editions of "Weather Center Live" were eliminated and replaced by additional long-form programming. A new set also debuted, replacing the high-definition capable set introduced in 2008. The Weather Channel also debuted two new slogans: "It's Amazing Out There" and "Weather All The Time".
On December 2, 2013, The Weather Channel announced that "Good Morning America" weather anchor Sam Champion would be joining the network to host a new morning program to premiere in March 2014, called "AM HQ".
On January 14, 2014, DirecTV removed The Weather Channel from its lineup after the two parties were unable to come to terms on a new carriage agreement; as a result, DirecTV became the first major pay television provider to drop the channel in its history. Two weeks before the channel's carriage agreement was set to expire on December 31 (after which the deadline for a new carriage deal was extended by two weeks), the satellite provider began carrying WeatherNation TV (the successor to The WeatherCast) on channel 361 on December 16, 2013 – placing the channel next to The Weather Channel's slot on channel 362; WeatherNation replaced The Weather Channel on channel 362 (while still being carried on channel 361) when the latter channel was pulled. Representatives for DirecTV stated that it added WeatherNation TV in response to subscriber complaints regarding the amount of reality programs on The Weather Channel, which it estimated had amounted to 40% of its daily schedule.

Gloucester Centurions

The Gloucester Centurions are an American football team based in Gloucester. They currently compete in the National South League of the BAFA National Leagues.
History.
1985-1993.
American Football has been played in Gloucester since its début in the United Kingdom. The first league team to play in the area was the Gloucester Boars who played in the 1985 United Kingdom American Football Association. The team progressed to the Budweiser League and played as the Cotswold Bears during 1986 and 1987. They won the SW conference, on the way they even played at Kingsholm Stadium, (the home of Gloucester Rugby) against the Cardiff Tigers in front of a crowd of 3000.
The Bears folded at the end of the 1987 season. A new team was set up at Plock Court, Gloucester playing under the name of the Severn Vale Royals. The Royals took part in the British National Gridiron League during the 1989 to 1993 seasons, reaching a Bowl Final in their rookie year, but losing out to their bitter rivals,the Cheltenham Chieftains. The Severn Vale Royals closed at the end of the 1993 season and the team was replaced the following year by the West Country Phoenix. But less than a year later, the Phoenix disappeared. Several youth teams emerged during the mid-1990s but without any real success. However in 2007 American Football returned to Gloucester.
2007-2008.
In early 2007 a team called the Gloucester Banshees set up in the city of Gloucester. Many of the Banshees staff were involved in previous teams, such as the Severn Vale Royals, West Country Phoenix, Cheltenham Chieftains, Cotswold Bears and the Gloucester Boars. After a 10 months feasibility study (to see if the interest was still there for American Football), training began in early February 2008. The Banshees first fully kitted game was with Premiership "giants" Bristol Aztecs. This game was a one-sided affair with the Aztecs posting 50 points without reply. But, the Banshees were soon to taste their first win, when they beat a full strength Reading Renegades. A late season game with Division One Oxford Saints ended with victory going to the Saints but the Banshees had successfully completed their Associate campaign and awaited the deliberations of the assessor from League HQ.
Going on the strength of superb facilities that included a full-sized 100-yard playing field, the British American Football League promoted the Banshees to full league membership in November 2008. The Banshees drafted players from the now-defunct Hereford Chargers. in preparation for their first season as full members of the British American Football League.
2009.
The Banshees were placed into Division 2 Southwest conference and scheduled to meet the Cornish Sharks, Berkshire Renegades, Plymouth Admirals, Hampshire Thrashers on a home and away basis with 2 cross conference games, home to the Shropshire Revolution and away to the Staffordshire Surge to make up the 10 games season. Head Coach Maurice Myers lead a squad consisting mainly of rookies supplemented by American quarterback Derek Yenerall to an impressive 3-1-6 (W-T-L) record in their first full league season, highlights including an early season 21-all draw at conference favourites Hampshire Thrashers and a win at Plymouth Admirals.
2010.
With Coach Myers still at the helm the Banshees approached the season with confidence that they could improve upon the previous year, however the early season loss of American quarterback Yenerall and dominant nose tackle Marcus Campbell to the nearby Premiership giants Bristol Aztecs was a major setback. The Banshees did manage an impressive 34-0 victory over the Cornish Sharks early on but that was to be the only highlight of the season as after that the loss of key offensive linemen Iain Vanes (career ending knee injury) and Karl Friston (joined Bristol Aztecs) decimated the offence even further. Despite creditable performances away to Watford Cheetahs and Milton Keynes Pathfinders the Banshees ended the season with a 1-9 (W-L) record.
2011.
At the start of the 2011 season the club members elected a new committee at the annual AGM. 3 games into the season both the Head Coach and Administrator resigned due to an internal dispute with regards to player selection. The Banshees appointed Colin Branagh to fulfill the vacant head coach position. A tough schedule including perennial title favourites Cornish Sharks, Berkshire Renegades, Bournemouth Bobcats, Bristol Apache and Welsh powerhouse South Wales Warriors (relegated from Division 1 the previous season on a technicality) saw the Banshees finish the season with an 0-1-9 (W-T-L) record.
Shortly after the end of the season Head Coach Branagh tendered his resignation and subsequently took up the General Manager's role at Leicester Falcons. As part of an entire club restructure a submission for renaming the team was made to and accepted by BAFANL and from 2012 onwards the team is called Gloucester Centurions. The Centurions also decided upon relocation and moved across town from Oxstalls Indoor Centre to Sir Thomas Richs School. Oakleaze, Longlevens, Gloucester where in addition to the normal facilities you would expect of an American football club they also enjoy the benefit of a swimming pool and weights room for players and staff use.
2012.
The 2012 season saw the Centurions scheduled against Oxford Saints, Bournemouth Bobcats, Cornish Sharks and Bristol Apache. They ended the season with two wins, 6 losses and two draws, a visible improvement on the previous season.
2013.
The 2013 will see the Gloucester Centurions compete in a newly restructured National South Division against the same teams of the 2012 season, with the inclusion of the Farnham Knights, the Solent Thrashers and the Swindon Storm.
As well as a new coaching staff and new players, the Centurions will also play this season in a new kit, with the purple and silver changing to a purple and black design.
Season finished with a very respectable 8 wins and 2 losses. Just narrowly missing out on a playoff spot.
Team colours.
The Gloucester Centurions play in a purple home kit with silver trim and their alternative is the old Banshees second strip (white with red trims).
Media.
The Banshees were featured on BBC Radio Gloucestershire and The West Country Tonight. They also had excellent coverage from the local papers in the county and beyond.

Loren Babe

Loren Rolland Babe (January 11, 1928 – February 14, 1984), nicknamed "Bee Bee," was an American professional baseball infielder, manager, scout and coach.

List of Premier League stadiums

Since the inception of the Premier League, England's highest level of association football annual league tournament, 53 football stadiums have been used to host matches. The inaugural round of Premier League matches took place on 15 August 1992 with 11 clubs hosting the opening fixtures. Following the Hillsborough Disaster in 1989, the Taylor Report recommended the abolition of standing terraces by the start of the 1994–95 season, to be replaced by all-seater stadiums. However, following Fulham's promotion from the Championship in the 2000–2001 season, terraces returned temporarily to the Premier League as The Football Association allowed the club extra time to complete renovations. The club were forced to play at Loftus Road after inadequate progress was made in converting Craven Cottage, but they returned to their home ground after building work was completed in time for the 2004–05 season.
Burnley's Turf Moor stadium became the 50th Premier League stadium when it hosted Burnley's first ever home Premier League fixture, against champions Manchester United, on 19 August 2009. Cardiff's Cardiff City Stadium became the 53rd Premier League stadium, when they played their first ever home Premier League match against Manchester City on 25 August 2013.

Corticopontine fibers

Corticopontine fibers are projections from the cerebral cortex to the pontine nuclei.
Depending upon the lobe of origin, they can be classified as frontopontine fibers, parietopontine fibers, temporopontine fibers and occipitopontine fibers.
They are motor fibers that stretch from the precentral gyrus (motor strip) to the nuclei of cranial nerves V (trigeminal), VII (facial) and XII (hypoglossal). These fibers run alongside the corticospinal fibers.
Clinical significance.
Several clinical phenomena result from injury to the corticopontine fibers. The corticopontine fibers to cranial nerves V and XII descend to bilateral nuclei. Injury to these fibers result in tongue weakness (cranial nerve XII) and jaw weakness (cranial nerve V) but not full paralysis. The corticopontine fibers to cranial nerve VII descend to innervate bilateral sub-nuclei that supply the forehead but only contralateral to the sub-nuclei that supply the lower face. Injury to these fibers results in paralysis of the lower face, but only weakness of the forehead.

Union Böckingen

Union Böckingen is a German sports club from the district of Böckingen in the city of Heilbronn, Baden-Württemberg. Founded in 1908 out of the merger of "Fussball Klub Germania 08 Böcking" and "Viktoria Böcking", the club today has 1,200 members in departments for football, canoeing, handball, and skiing. The footballers make up the largest section in the club with nearly 600 members. The most successful department is the canoe section which has won medals at the national and world championships.
In 2012 the football department of the club left to merge with FC Heilbronn to form a new club, the FC Union Heilbronn.
__TOC__
History.
After having played in the tier-one "Kreisliga Württemberg" (1920–22) and then the "Bezirksliga Württemberg-Baden" (since 1926) and winning the title there in 1931, "Union"'s most significant football achievement was their 1933 championship in the Gauliga Württemberg, one of 16 top-flight divisions formed that year in the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich. That title put the team into the opening round of the national finals in a qualifying group that included "SV Waldhof Mannheim", "Mühlheimer SV", and "Kickers Offenbach" where they won only two of six matches. The next year the Böckingen side crashed to a ninth place finish and were relegated. They immediately bounced back and earned a string of upper table finishes before again being sent down for a single season in 1941-42. After two more seasons in the Gauliga the team withdrew from competition in November 1944 as World War II overtook the country. In 1938, "Böckingen" took part in the opening round of the Tschammerpokal, predecessor of today's German Cup, where they were put out by "Bayern Munich" (0:7).
Following the conflict, "Böckingen" played in the Amateurliga Württemberg (II). A second place finish there in 1950 was followed by a failed promotion attempt, and a poor campaign in the subsequent season saw the club fall from the 2. Liga Süd to the now third tier Amateurliga Württemberg. They returned to second division play for a two year turn before slipping into lower level competition for most of the 50s. They reemerged in the Amateurliga Nordwürttemberg in 1963 and spent all but one of the next 14 seasons there. Second place results in 1966 and 1970 earned the team a place in the opening rounds of the national amateur championship. They also made their second appearance in the German Cup, again bowing out in the first round, this time to "Bayer Uerdingen" (2:8). Following the 1977-78 season "Union" descended to lower level play.
In recent years, the club has been a steady member of the tier eight Bezirksliga Unterland, spending a year in the Landesliga in 2004-05 and briefly dropping down to the Kreisliga in 2010-11, but each time returning to the Bezirksliga straight away. The 2010-11 season saw the team earnining promotion back to this league by winning 25 out of its 28 season games and only being defeated once.
In 2012 the football department of the club left to merge with FC Heilbronn to form a new club, the FC Union Heilbronn. Both clubs voted on the merger on 27 March 2012 and achieved the necessary 75 percent majority to carry out the merger, ending the history of the football department of Union Böckingen.

2006–07 was Bolton Wanderers Football Club's eighth season in the Premier League, and their sixth consecutive season in the top division of English football and covers the period from 1 July 2006 to June 30, 2007. Their failure to win the Premier League title made it the 68th time that they have competed at the top level of English football without winning the title, the most of any club.
Premier League.
Bolton overcame the previous season's disappointment of failing to qualify for Europe and finished in seventh, enough for UEFA Cup football. Bolton had spent much of the season challenging for a Champions League and had peaked as high as third, but for a club of Bolton's size and resources to be challenging at the top end of the table was something for Bolton supporters to be proud of.
Three games before the end of the season, manager Sam Allardyce announced his resignation as Bolton manager and was replaced by Sammy Lee for the final three games of the season.

The Sarancha class is the NATO reporting name for a hydrofoil missile boat built for the Soviet Navy. The Soviet designation was "Project 1240 Uragan" (Серия 1240 Ураган- Hurricane).
Design.
The boat was a very complex design. Unlike previous Soviet hydrofoil boats the Project 1240 had fully submerged foils with propellers mounted on the after set of foils. The boat achieved a speed of and had a heavy armament. It was deemed too large, complex and expensive for series production and only a prototype boat was built.
Missile boat MRK-5.
The MRK-5 (МРК-5) was laid down at the Petrovski plant in Leningrad in 1973 and was on trials until 1977. In 1979 She was the transferred to the Black Sea Fleet via Russian inland waterways. She was based in Sevastopol until 1990 when she was decommissioned. In 1992 she was damaged by fire and sunk in shallow water. The wreck was raised and scrapped.

Conjugate eye movement refers to motor coordination of the eyes that allows for bilateral fixation on a single object. Several centers in the brainstem are involved. Horizontal conjugate gaze is controlled by the nuclei of CN III and CN VI, the paramedian pontine reticular formation, and the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi-medial vestibular nucleus. Vertical conjugate gaze is controlled by the nuclei of CN III and CN IV, the rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF), and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal.

The village is on the Saints' Way long-distance footpath. "The Fishermans Arms" pub overlooks the river. Annie Vernon, the Olympic rower, was a member of Castle Dore Rowing Club in Golant.
History.
A, once well used, ford crossed the river near Golant. During the English Civil War in 1644 a 10,000-strong parliamentary army fought Royalist forces in area. King Charles was in the area during the campaign. The Earl of Essex and other prominent parliamentarians escaped by boat to Plymouth. many 17th century cannonballs and musket balls have been found in the area.
Golant railway station known as "Golant Halt" was situated beside the river south of the village. It was served by trains on the Great Western Railway's Fowey branch line from 1 July 1896 until 4 January 1965. The train was affectionately known as "The Rattler".

Das ist Walter

Das ist Walter (German for "That is Walter") is debut studio album by Yugoslav band Zabranjeno Pušenje released in April 1984. The album title is the closing line from the 1972 partisan film "Valter brani Sarajevo". The first track is the theme from the film.
The album recording began in November 1983 in studio 17 that was located in record producer Mahmud Paša Ferović's house.
Released by Jugoton, the record was out in limited circulation of 3,000 copies, indicative of the label's modest expectations, however, it started selling surprisingly well, eventually crossing the mark of 100,000 copies sold. It also received plenty of accolades, including making the list of top 100 albums in the history of pop and rock music in Yugoslavia published in the 1998 book "". "Das ist Walter" is listed in the 87th place.
Recording.
After gigging locally in their hometown Sarajevo during 1982 and 1983 in university student clubs such as Kuk, Trasa, and CEDUS, Zabranjeno Pušenje was ready to take the next step — releasing a studio album. Consisting of seven energetic youngsters in their early 20s, itching to increase their profile on the scene, they recorded demos for some dozen tracks during spring 1983 in a studio in Kiseljak. The lineup that recorded the demos was — frontman and vocalist Dr. Nele Karajlić, rhythm guitar player and main songwriter Sejo Sexon, lead guitarist Mujo Snažni, bassist Samir "Ćera I" Ćeramida, drummer Zenit "FuDo" Đozić, keyboards player Seid Mali Karajlić, and saxophonist Ogi Gajić.
At one of their gigs in Sarajevo's Trasa club sometime during summer 1983, the Zabranjeno Pušenje youngsters were seen by 33-year-old Milić Vukašinović, established musician from Sarajevo at the time fronting his band Vatreni Poljubac having already experienced a measure of fame as former drummer of Bijelo Dugme during the 1970s. They also gave him their demo tapes at the gig. Liking what he saw and heard, Vukašinović put them in touch with his friend and former Čičak bandmate from the late 1960s, Mahmut "Paša" Ferović, who now owned a modest recording studio located in his own house where he worked as producer.
Going into the studio to record the album, Zabranjeno Pušenje made some personnel changes compared to the lineup that recorded the demos six months earlier. The band got a new rhythm section with Munja Mitić and Šeki Gayton becoming new bassist and drummer, respectively. Produced by Ferović himself, the recording sessions began in November 1983 and took almost 7 months to complete due to various extenuating circumstances. Karajlić said the following about the recording sessions: 
The band's rhythm guitarist and main lyrics writer Sejo Sexon remembers the recording sessions as follows: 
Midway through the recording session, the young band got a hold of Raka Marić, Bijelo Dugme's manager, who helped them find a record label that would release the material. He first offered it to PGP RTB, but after they refused it, Marić contacted Jugoton's creative director Siniša Škarica who accepted it.
Track listing.
All lyrics written by Sejo Sexon, all music composed by Dr. Nele Karajlić, except were noted. Arranged by Zabranjeno Pušenje.
Rerelease.
The album was re-released in 1999 by Nimfa Sound label from Sarajevo.

Daniel Leavitt

Daniel Leavitt (November 16, 1813–July 27, 1859) was an early American inventor who with his partner Edwin Wesson patented the first revolver after Samuel Colt's, and subsequently manufactured one of the first American revolving pistols. The innovative design was manufactured only briefly before a patent suit by Colt forced the company to stop producing the Leavitt & Wesson Dragoon revolver. But Leavitt's early patents, and those of his partner Wesson, stoked competition and helped drive the technological and manufacturing boom that produced the modern firearms industry.
Early life.
Leavitt was born November 16, 1813, at Rye, New Hampshire, the son of Benning Leavitt, influential businessman, state senator, county commissioner and later Chicopee Selectman, and his wife Olive (Jenness) Leavitt. Daniel Leavitt married in 1838 at West Springfield, Massachusetts, Ruth Jeannette Ball. They had three children.

Leavitt took out a patent on his new design on April 29, 1837, when the U.S. Patent Office granted him United States patent number 182 for an 'improvement in many-chambered cylinder firearm.' The early weapon, the second of its kind, was a .40-caliber percussion, 6-shot single-action revolver with a 6¾-inch octagon tip-up barrel.
Leavitt took out his patent less than a year after Samuel Colt had obtained a patent on his seminal revolver, and before Colt had a chance to bring his new weapon to market. The patent was granted to Leavitt at his residence in Cabotville, Massachusetts, now part of Chicopee, Massachusetts.
Leavitt's innovation was the beveled face of the cylinder, which was designed to direct flash from the fired cylinder away from adjacent chambers, thus preventing multiple discharges, the major problem with early percussion revolvers. "The problem with all the early breechloaders, as well as Colt's revolver," write the authors of "Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture", "was the escape of gas from the breech." In his design, Leavitt attempted to solve the problem through the beveling and the new convex shape he imparted to the revolving cylinder.
Leavitt's design, wrote Philadelphia's "Journal of the Franklin Institute" in 1838, was "one of those fire arms which have several chambers bored in a cylinder, the axis of which is parallel to the axis of the barrel of the gun, and which chambers can be successively made to coincide with the said barrel." But Leavitt's innovation, noted the Journal, was to make the end of the cylinder convex to draw off the fumes and flash of the cartridge explosions.
Early firearm manufacturing.
The inventor's early patent demonstrated that the firearms industry was attracting considerable innovation and competition as it was getting off the ground. (In the same year that Leavitt's patent was granted, the U.S. Patent Office granted two other men patents on innovations in many-chambered firearms). On February 25, 1836, Samuel Colt had been granted a U.S. patent (later renumbered X9430) for his patent for a 'revolving gun.'
The revolvers were produced in small quantities by the firm of Wesson, Stephens & Miller in nearby Hartford, Connecticut. In 1839 Edwin Wesson, principal of the manufacturing concern and himself an inventor, make some modifications to Leavitt's initial design, dubbing the new product the 'Wesson & Leavitt' revolver, which he began producing at a factory in Massachusetts, a concern which led to the formation of the Massachusetts Arms Company of Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. After a patent grant to Wesson in 1850, awarded posthumously, the first Wesson & Leavitt revolvers rolled off the line at Chicopee Falls. The enormous 40-caliber handgun weighed over 4 pounds and was nearly 15 inches long, with 7.1 inches of that in the barrel itself.
In 1850/51 the firm produced some 800 copies of the new revolver, which could be reloaded by simply pressing a latch, raising the barrel and pulling the cylinder forward and off the axis pin. Along with the standard model, another thousand smaller .31-caliber Belt models were manufactured with a shorter barrel.
The new revolvers were embraced by customers. General Winfield Scott, for instance, carried one of the smaller Wesson & Leavitt 32-caliber six-shot revolvers in the Mexican-American War.
Samuel Colt sues for patent infringement.
The success of the fledgling company's weapon soon attracted the attention of Samuel Colt, who sent his cousin Henry Sargeant to purchase one of the revolvers. Emboldened by the recent extension of his original patent until 1857, Colt sued Wesson & Leavitt, now run by Edwin's brother Daniel Wesson, who had gone to work for his brother Edwin in 1843 and who took over after Edwin's 1849 death. Colt's lawsuit alleged infringement of Colt's original patent on the revolver. The case went to trial in October 1852 before the United States circuit court for the District of New York. Both sides alleged tampering with the original U.S. Patent files as well as fraudulent exhibits. The case was extensively covered by the New York City newspapers. A month later, Colt had overwhelmed the tiny manufacturer in court and won large damages, forcing the Massachusetts Arms Company into eventual liquidation in 1853.
Following Colt's victory, his attorney Edward N. Dickerson fired off a circular at the manufacturers in the firearms business. "You will please to take notice," Dickerson wrote, "to desist forthwith from the sale of any REPEATING FIRE ARMS, in which rotation, or locking or releasing, are produced by combining the breech with the lock; or in which the cones are separated by partitions, or set into recesses; except such as are made by Col. Colt, at Hartford."
"Needless to say," write the authors of "Samuel Colt: Arms, Art, and Invention", "this circular had a chilling effect on the American arms industry." A number of the firms warned by Dickerson capitulated and paid damages to settle with Colt. But despite this early victory, Colt's attorney warned his client not to persist with his patent infringement suits. "Nothing is easier than to get into a big law suit", said Dickerson, "but there are many easier things than to get out successfully. Your luck, as I suppose you will call it, has hitherto been very good – better than "any other inventor" in America by far, but it may turn, and another suit may bring out something which we know not of, and which may destroy us..."
Dickerson may have been smarting from confrontations in the U.S. District Court battle, which turned into a jousting match between two of the foremost attorneys of the day: Dickerson representing Colt; and Rufus Choate representing the Massachusetts Arms Company. Nevertheless it was Dickerson – and his client Colt, who was away on business in Europe during the trial – who came out on top in the first courtroom dust-up.
Despite the warning of Dickerson to his client not to press his luck, Colt's litigious salvos had one effect: they virtually shut down the output of his competitors for several years, and his firm became the largest manufacturer of civilian firearms during the 1850s.
The aftermath of Colt's litigation.
Altogether the Massachusetts Arms Company – considered a predecessor of arms manufacturer Smith & Wesson – manufactured roughly a thousand of the .31-caliber belt models of the original patented revolver, 200 of which were purchased by the abolitionist Massachusetts-Kansas Aid Committee in 1856. Many of these firearms later found their way to abolitionist John Brown.
The Massachusetts Arms Company continued in business, and after the expiration of some of Samuel Colt's original patents, as well as improvements in the design of its revolvers, the company manufactured an assortment of weapons. for World War I).
The early inventor, although eventually crushed by the legal team of arms magnate Samuel Colt, had helped spur competition and drive technological improvements in the design of American pistols – guns later used in the Old West, the American Civil War and elsewhere, and the envy of the world's firearm manufacturers. Leavitt himself served in the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia in 1847 as Captain of Company F, 10th Regiment, 6th Brigade and was a member of the Chicopee Freemasons lodge.
Leavitt did not confine himself to the design of firearms. On August 18, 1842 he was granted a patent (number 2755) for a 'Mode of Securing Bobbins in Shuttles for Weaving'. Leavitt's patent for an innovation for bobbins used in power looms demonstrated that the inventor had his eye on another emerging New England industry. It was an industry in which Leavitt had more than passing interest: his father Benning owned a Chicopee factory that produced bobbins. There is no indication whether Leavitt's patent for textile manufacturing was more successful than his firearm patents.
Leavitt died at Chicopee on July 27, 1859.

Prior to playing professionally, Brummett attended Wichita State University. With them, he won the 1989 College World Series Most Outstanding Player award while a senior. He is the only player from Wichita State University to win that award. In 1989, he tied for the Division I lead in wins with Kirk Dressendorfer and Scott Erickson. That total also tied him with Bryan Oelkers for most wins ever by a Wichita State pitcher. 
To close out his collegiate career, he had 13 straight victories. Overall, he had 43 wins, 59 starts and 424 innings pitched in his collegiate career. He also had 364 strikeouts.
Brummett was drafted by the Giants in the 11th round of the 1989 amateur draft. He played for two different minor league teams in 1989, the San Jose Giants and the Everett Giants. For San Jose, he went 0-1 with a 5.59 ERA in two games. For Everett, he went 4-2 with a 2.88 ERA in 14 games (10 starts). 
In 1990, Brummett played for the Clinton Giants, going 2-2 with a 3.51 ERA in six games (four starts). He again played for Clinton in 1991, going 10-5 with a 2.72 ERA in 16 games. Brummett split the 1992 season with the San Jose Giants and the Phoenix Firebirds. He appeared in 19 games for the Firebirds, going 10-4 with a 2.61 ERA. In three games with Phoenix, he went 0-1 with a 7.71 ERA.

On May 29, he made his major league debut, against the Atlanta Braves, pitching 6 innings, striking out three batters (all three were Ron Gant) and earning the win. He would end up pitching eight games for the Giants, going 2-3 with a 4.70 ERA. 
On September 1, 1993, he was the player to be named later in a deal that originally took place on August 28. The Giants sent a player to be named later (Brummett), Aaron Fultz and minor leaguer Andres Duncan to the Twins for Jim Deshaies. Brummett would start five games for the Twins, going 2-1 with a 5.74 ERA. Overall, he went 4-4 with a 5.08 ERA in 13 big league games. He played his final game on September 30.
Although his big league career was over, his professional career was not.

The Mobil Showcase Network, also known as Mobil Showcase or Mobil Showcase Theatre, was an occasional or ad hoc television network from 1976 to 1984 with an ad hoc group of stations.
Background.
A Mobil Oil media expert, Herb Schmertz, wrote canned paid "editorials" placed into newspapers like the "New York Times" opinion-editorial page. Schmertz also had Mobil underwriting "Masterpiece Theatre" to improve Mobil's image. He also considered having the company buy a newspaper, the "Long Island Press". He instead settled on a "sort of TV network" as Mobil and Schmertz were frustrated with the network-developed anti-oil-company news and documentaries.
History.
Schmertz worked with SFM Media Service Corporation lining up 43 stations, primarily in the top 50 markets; half of these were network affiliates. Mobil paid $3.2 million to the stations for the 8 PM ET/PT Thursday time slot for 10 weeks. In the winter of 1976-1977, Mobil launched its first show, "Ten Who Dared", under the "Great Explorer" series. The show beat the networks in the ratings defeating NBC's "The Fantastic Journey", and even CBS's "The Waltons". Based on the ratings, Mobil arranged for two more "'non-network' series."
In 1979, the Showcase featured "Edward & Mrs. Simpson". For summer 1980, Mobil Showcase assembled a group of shows dubbed "Summershow".

Climate of Manitoba

Because of its location in the centre of the North American continent, the climate of Manitoba is extreme. In general, temperatures and precipitation decrease from south to north, and precipitation also decreases from east to west. Since Manitoba is far removed from the moderating influences of both mountain ranges and large bodies of water, and because of the generally flat landscape in many areas, it is exposed to numerous weather systems throughout the year, including cold Arctic high-pressure air masses that settle in from the northwest, usually during the months of January and February. In the summer, the air masses often come out of the southern United States, as the stronger Azores High ridges into the North American continent, the more warm, humid air is drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico, generally during the months of July or August.
General climate.
Manitoba is a sunny province; according to Environment Canada, Manitoba ranked first for clearest skies year round. Southern Manitoba has a fairly long frost-free season, consisting of between 120 and 140 days in the Red River Valley. It is also prone to high humidity in the summer months with the extreme of 53.0 °C (127.4 °F) in Carman, which set the highest humidex recorded in Canada. There are three main climatic regions.
The northern sections of the province (including the city of Thompson) fall in the subarctic climate zone (Köppen "Dfc"). This region features long and extremely cold winters and brief, warm summers with little precipitation. Overnight lows as low as occur on several days each winter, and the temperature may remain below for weeks.
Southern Manitoba (including Winnipeg), falls into the humid continental climate zone (Köppen "Dfb"). Temperatures here are similar to the semi-arid climate zone, but this region is the most humid area in the Prairie Provinces with moderate precipitation.
Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle, and as such, is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and frequently experiences blizzards because of the openness of the landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.
The following table provides the 1971 to 2000 averages for high and low temperatures in July and January, rainfall, snowfall and precipitation for seven cities.
Tornadoes.
Southern parts of the province, located just north of Tornado Alley, experience tornadoes each year, with 15 confirmed touchdowns in 2006. In 2007, on June 22 and June 23, numerous tornadoes touched down, including an F5 Tornado that devastated parts of Elie (the strongest officially recorded tornado in Canada).

It was at No 9 that he made his debut in the match against Kent at Bath in June 1953. He played in seven further matches that summer, never making more than 30 runs, and never coming in higher than No 6.
Not appearing in 1954, he returned in 1955, and was more successful immediately. On his return to the team, again at Bath, this time against Leicestershire, he made 46, batting at No 5 in the first innings. But this was the highest score of his career: he failed to maintain this form and he was not retained on the county staff at the end of the season. He did not bowl in first-class cricket.

Louise Pedersen (model)

Louise Pedersen (born November 17, 1981) is a Danish fashion model.
Early Life and discovery.
Pedersen was born on November 19, 1981 in Skjern, Denmark. She worked as a waitress before being discovered on her way to Norway by train. Another model scouted her, and by the time the train arrived at Central Station, the head of 2pm Model Management wanted to see her. At first, she thought the whole thing was a joke, and all of it was fake, so she politely refused, although after she left Norway, she traveled to Copenhagen to meet with the agency to just say hello.
Career.
She ended up signing with 2pm and worked locally before heading to New York City for the first time. Before she left New York for Milan's fashion shows, Mario Testino spoke with her. During her castings at Milan, designers would casually say, "Oh, that's the girl Mario was talking about." 
Her debut as the opener for the fall 2002 Prada was actually a surprise. She did not know she would open the show until a few minutes before it started. Walking for other designers like Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, and Calvin Klein that season made her one of the most in-demand girls for seasons to come. In 2003, she was featured in an infamous Gucci advertisement, where it showed male model Adam Senn in the act of pulling her underwear down, and it revealed her pubic hair had a "g" shaved into it. The ad was banned in various countries, because of the radical advertising
Her campaigns and magazines have also gained her some ground. She has snagged campaigns for Gucci, Levi's, Carolina Herrera, Chanel, and DKNY. She is the current face of Maxmara's fragrance and DKNY's fragrance, "Be Delicious". She has also graced the pages of "Vogue" and "Allure".
After leaving the runway for a few seasons, Louise walked for Givenchy and Diesel Black Gold Fall 2009/2010
Personal life.
Pedersen has made friends with models Anouck Lepere, Mia Rosing, and Adam Senn. She likes to paint, especially in the spirit of Gustav Klimpt. She now has a husband, artistic photographer Arthur Meehan, and gave birth to a daughter, Maya, in 2007

St Raphael's Church, San Rafael

The St Raphael's Church (in Spanish "Iglesia de San Rafael Arcángel") is a colombian church in San Rafael (Department of Antioquia). The church is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sonsón–Rionegro.
History.
A little chapel of straw and bahareque was built "El Sueldo" (San Rafael's old name) by Juan Mazo, and the brothers Juan and Agustín Mira for two years since 1864; due to the distance from others churches, the Bishop of Medellín, Herrera Restrepo, created the new parish, with José de Jesús Correa as priest. He believed that the chapel and the village was based in a very remote and narrow location. After, the El Sueldo's inhabitants moved their homes near the river; and just there, Correa began a new church in August 1904, with plans drawn by the architect Emigdio Rincón. Nevertheless, the end of the building was done by the Correa's successors.
The church has three naves and one tower; and into that, three altars; one is the high altar, another has the Arcangel Rafel image, and the other one, the image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
In front of the facade is the principal town's principal square; with a bust of Correa.

Saxon Fratricidal War

The Saxon Fratricidal War (German: "Sächsischer Bruderkrieg") was a war fought between the two brothers Frederick II, Elector of Saxony and Duke William III over Wettin ruled areas from 1446 to 1451. After a dispute over the division of certain family lands between Frederick II and William III, the Division of Altenburg eventually led to growing tensions between the two brothers and an inability to agree on who ruled which areas. After failed attempts at reconciliation, the war broke out and lasted for five years. The war was destructive and had no clear winner before being ended with a peace treaty at Naumburg. Following the war and subsequent divisions the Saxons lost much of their former power and influence within the different German states and families.
Background.
The House of Wettin and its line of Saxon princes gained a large amount of land over the years mainly through inheritance, including the Landgraviate of Thuringia, the Margraviate of Meissen, the Duchy of Saxony and the Electorate of Saxony. Frederick I was the Elector of Saxony and Margrave of Meissen and ruled over all of the lands except for the lands in Thuringia. Frederick I's cousin Frederick of Thuringia was Landgrave of Thuringia and ruled over those lands. When Frederick I died in 1428, his four sons Frederick II, Sigismund, Heinrich, and William III inherited his lands jointly. Heinrich died in 1435, and in 1440 Sigmisund became Bishop of Würzburg and renounced his claims to the land. Frederick, who was the eldest of the two remaining sons, now held the Electorate of Saxony and some land around Wittenberg in his own right, whilst throughout the remainder of the land he ruled together with William. This continued without serious incident for twelve years until, in 1440, Frederick of Thuringia died childless, and the two brothers inherited extensive land within Thuringia as well as the title of Landgrave of Thuringia.
The division of this new land in Thuringia could not be agreed upon, and on 16 July 1445 the two remaining brothers tried to partition the land between them in the Division of Altenburg. When Frederick II chose the western part and not the Margraviate of Meissen on September 26, 1445 in Leipzig, William rejected the division. On December 11 of the same year they attempted to reconcile in the monastery of Neuwerk in Halle (Saale) in what was known as the "Hallescher Machtspruch" (English: the Power Dictum of Halle). The Archbishop of Magdeburg Frederick III of Beichlingen, the Margrave Frederick II of Brandenburg and the Landgrave Ludwig II of Hesse actively participated as judges, however the two brothers failed to reach a peaceful resolution.
War.
War first broke out between Frederick II and William III in 1446 when they were unable to resolve their dispute. Frederick proved stronger, and William brought in forces from Bohemia, including Hussites. Frederick's forces were led by commanders such as Kunz von Kaufungen, a captain from the tower of Kaufungen located near modern day Limbach-Oberfrohna. Frederick's forces under the command of Kunz won a victory at Gera and occupied the small town, however William's forces and Bohemian allies caused a large amount of damage to locations within Kaufungen in return. Kunz himself had much of his property destroyed and was taken captive by Bohemians. Eventually he paid the sum of 4,000 golden gulden for his freedom, which was very extravagant for the time. No side could gain a clear advantage throughout the war and the fighting turned out to be an extended period of "ruinous confusion" for the region. The war lasted five years and ended on January 27, 1451 when a peace was reached at Naumburg. This peace could not reestablish a joint rule, but let the two sides accept a peaceful division of the lands.
Aftermath.
After the war, Kunz von Kaufungen expected to be repaid by Frederick II for the massive losses of his property during the fighting. Frederick also had losses of his own and therefore followed the letter of his contract with Kunz and did not even repay the ransom Kunz paid to the Bohemians. Frederick stated that Kunz was just his hired soldier, and he was not bound to protect him or repay his losses. Frederick eventually agreed upon bringing in arbitrators to settle the case, but Kunz left the arbitration before hearing the verdict when he realized it would not reach his expectations. Kunz continued to complain and insult Frederick until Frederick banished him from the lands. Kunz left to Bohemia and lived in the castle of Isenburg. Kunz eventually kidnapped Frederick's two sons, Ernest and Albert, from the castle of Altenburg in what was called the "Prinzenraub" (English: "The stealing of the princes"). Prince Albert was found that very night when Kunz was caught, while Prince Ernst was released four days later when Kunz's allies released him for a pardon. On July 14, 1455, Kunz von Kaufungen was beheaded by order of Frederick at Freiberg.
The lands fought over during the war were ruled peacefully again, however this time separately instead of jointly. Eventually, Frederick II died, and his two sons Ernest and Albert inherited his lands jointly in 1464. When William III died in 1482, without any sons, they inherited his lands and split them between them by the Treaty of Leipzig in 1485. The division of these lands and this war led to the Saxons losing a large amount of influence within the different German states and no longer being one of the most powerful German houses.

Pole jam

A pole jam is a skateboarding trick maneuver that skateboarders do over a bent pole. A pole jam is an action that skateboarders do when they approach a bent pole and they then continue to ride up and over the top of the pole. (The ollie is not generally used to get into the pole jam.)
Typically the pole used is bent down into an acute angle, so that grinding or sliding it is easier.
Pole jams can be combined with other skateboard tricks performed when coming out of the grind.
Tricks that can be used in a pole jam include:
Pole Jams are also used by snowboarders for similar purposes.

Richard Milazzo

Richard Milazzo is a critic, curator, publisher, independent scholar and poet. In the 1970s, he was the editor and co-publisher of Out of London Press. Among the books he edited were "The Syntactic Revolution: Collected Writings of Abraham Lincoln Gillespie" (New York, 1980) and the first English facsimile edition of "Pontormo’s Diary" (New York, 1982). Other titles included the first monograph on "Vito Acconci" by Mario Diacono, "Discussion" by Annina Nosei-Weber and Robert Pincus-Witten’s "Postminimalism". In 1981, he co-edited "La rosa disabitata 1960-1980" for Feltrinelli, one of the first anthologies to document the post-Gertrude Stein ‘Language’ writing movement in America, which included the writings of Vito Acconci, Charles Bernstein, John Cage, Clark Coolidge, Lyn Hejinian, Dick Higgins, Frank Kuenstler, Jackson Mac Low, Bob Perelman, Bern Porter and Jerome Rothenberg, among others. 
Life and work.
Since 1982, he has worked internationally as a critic and curator in the art world. His exhibitions and critical writings with Collins & Milazzo brought to prominence a whole new generation of artists in the 1980s. It was their exhibitions and writings that originally fashioned the theoretical context for a new kind of Conceptual Art – one that argued simultaneously against Neo-Expressionism and Picture-Theory Art –, and it was through this context that the work of many of the artists associated with Neo-Conceptualism (or what the critics reductively called “Simulationism” and “Neo Geo”) was first brought together – artists such as Ross Bleckner, James Welling, Steven Parrino, Richard Prince, Peter Nagy, Sarah Charlesworth, Mark Innerst, Allan McCollum, Peter Halley, Jonathan Lasker, Haim Steinbach, Jeff Koons, Philip Taaffe, Robert Gober, Saint Clair Cemin, Lawrence Carroll and Vik Muniz, among others. 
In the early 1980s, he co-published and co-edited with Tricia Collins "Effects: Magazine for New Art Theory" in the East Village, and from 1986 to 1988 he was the American co-editor of "Kunstforum" (Cologne). Among the many publications of those years were "Radical Consumption and the New Poverty" (New York: New Observations, 1987); "Art at the End of the Social" (Malmö, Sweden: The Rooseum, 1988); and "Hyperframes: A Post-Appropriation Discourse in Art", the lectures they delivered as Senior Critics at Yale University in 1988 and 1989. The lectures were originally published in 1989 and 1990 in two volumes in a bilingual English and French edition in Paris, with Editions Antoine Candau, and became known as the “Green Books.” They were recently reissued in an Italian edition by Campanotto Editore in Udine, in 2005. In 1991, he co-edited "An Anthology of Statements Celebrating the Twentieth Anniversary of White Columns" (New York: White Columns, 1991).
He co-curated and curated exhibitions in such galleries and museums as Nature Morte (NY), International with Monument (NY), White Columns (NY), C.A.S.H./Newhouse (NY), Postmasters (NY), Tibor De Nagy (NY), Diane Brown (NY), CEPA (Buffalo, NY), Margo Leavin (Los Angeles, CA), S.L. Simpson (Toronto, Canada), American Fine Arts Co. (NY), Massimo Audiello (NY), Lia Rumma (Naples, Italy), Galerie Albrecht (Munich, Germany), John Gibson (NY), 303 Gallery (NY), the Rooseum (Malmö, Sweden) Meyers/Bloom (Santa Monica, CA), Greenberg/Wilson (NY), Tony Shafrazi (NY), Sidney Janis (NY), Fay Gold (Atlanta, GA), The Hopper House (Nyack, NY), Annina Nosei (NY), Emilio Mazzoli (Modena, Italy), James Danziger (NY), and Alain Noirhomme (Brussels, Belgium), among others. Interviews with and writings on Collins & Milazzo’s critical and curatorial work have appeared in "Artforum", "Art in America", "ARTnews", "Arts Magazine", "The Los Angeles Times", "Vogue", "Artscribe International", "Village Voice", "Art & Auction", "The New York Times", "The New Yorker", "The New Criterion", "II Giornale dell’Arte", "The New York Times Magazine", "HG", "New Art Examiner", "Galeries Magazine", "Flash Art", among others.
He has taught, read, or participated in symposia and lectured at the University of Chicago (“‘Donna me prega’: Modern Poetry and Its Context”), Yale University (on Lacan), The Maryland Institute and College of Arts, The School of the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston), Tisch School of the Arts (New York University), The Museum of Modern Art (“Contemporary Art in Context”) in New York, The Glassell School of Art (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas), National Museum of American Art (Smithsonian Institute), Columbia University (New York), Jan van Eyck Akademie (Maastricht, Belgium), The Ghent Academy (Belgium), the High Museum (Atlanta, Georgia), among many others. He delivered the lecture “Rhetorical Answers: Curating and the Practice of Criticism” at The Meadows School of the Arts, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, in conjunction with the Lecture Series “Between Art and Life,” in celebration of Robert Rauschenberg’s receiving The Meadows Award for Excellence in the Arts. In December 2012, Howard B. Johnson donated a painting, "Available Portrait Colors", by Annette Lemieux to the Harvard Art Museums "in honor of Richard Milazzo." 
He has also lectured to Sotheby’s “Connoisseurship in Contemporary Art” seminar, and delivered a paper to the symposium, “The Convergence of Art and Philosophy,” with Jean Baudrillard, Joseph Kosuth and Peter Halley, at ICASA, New York University. He has also delivered a lecture on the work of Jeff Koons, “Against Interpretation; or, the Decline of Abstraction in Contemporary Sculpture,” at the New York Studio School, and a series of six lectures on Philip Taaffe at the Instituto Universitario di Architectura di Venezia; and a paper on poetics at Stony Brook University. He has given poetry readings at Beyond Baroque Foundation, Venice, CA.; and at Cornelia Street Café, Bowery Poetry Club, and the Russian Tea Room, in New York.
In the 1990s, he curated an exhibition space he founded, 11, rue Larrey at Sidney Janis Gallery, and co-founded and edits the publishing house, Edgewise Press. In 1996, he curated "Realism After Seven A.M.: Realist Painting After Edward Hopper – An Exhibition of 25 Artists in Honor of the 25th Anniversary of the Hopper House"; and, in 1998, he organized an art auction and benefit exhibition to relaunch Barney Rosset’s "Evergreen Review" on line. He has curated, both in the United States and Europe, one-person exhibitions of the works of Malcolm Morley, Ross Bleckner, Sandro Chia, Abraham David Christian, Robert Longo, Saint Clair Cemin, Alessandro Twombly, Michel Frère, Bill Rice, David Salle, Alex Katz, Mark Innerst, William Anastasi and Peter Nagy. He has written the major monographs, "Saint Clair Cemin: Sculptor from Cruz Alta" (New York: Brent Sikkema Editions, 2005), and "The Paintings of Ross Bleckner" (Brussels: Editions Alain Noirhomme, 2007). For Edgewise Press he has recently published and edited, with introductions, Ross Bleckner’s "Examined Life: Writings 1972-2007" and "Peter Halley: Selected Essays 1981-2001". 
Other art books are "Malcolm Morley" (a monograph); "Caravaggio on the Beach: Essays on Art in the 1990s"; "Jonathan Lasker: Expressions Become Things" (a study of the sketches); the study "The Flower Paintings of Ross Bleckner" (Modena: Galleria Mazzoli Editions, 2011), which functions as the companion volume to "The Paintings of Ross Bleckner"; a catalogue on the recent work of Mimmo Paladino (2012); and, most recently, "Peter Nagy: Entertainment Erases History - Works 1982 to 2004 to the Present" (New York: EISBox Projects, Inc., 2014). 
A book of his early poetry, "Alogon" (1969-1981), was published by Tokyo Publishing House in Tokyo in May 2007. Several of these poems appeared in such magazines as "Il Verri", "Tam Tam", and others, before he stopped writing poetry in 1982 and later resumed writing it in 1993. Others books of poetry include "Le Violon d’Ingres"; "Hotel of the Heart"; "Il facchino di Venezia (The Porter of Venice)"; "Green Nights / Golgotha / Love’s Quarrel"; "Stone Dragon Bridge"; "An Earring Depending from the Moon"; and "Circus in the Fog".

Johann Georg Ramsauer (7 March 1795 in Hallstatt -14 December 1874 in Linz) was an Austrian mine operator and the director of the excavations at the Hallstatt cemetery from 1846-1863. He spent his life working for the state service of the mines, moving from an apprentice to Bergmeister. During this time, he lived in the Rudolfsturm, a medieval fortress, where he raised 22 children. He kept comprehensive field notes, including magnificent watercolor drawings of grave arrangements and artifacts, which were never published but rather became the Protokolle manuscripts.

List of British Railways steam locomotives as of 31 December 1967

List of British Railways steam locomotives as of 31 December 1967. The following is a list of British Railways steam locomotives as of the end of 1967. With main line steam ending in 1968, these are the ones that survived to the last year. By this stage, steam locomotive stock had been severely decimated from over 20,000 locomotives at nationalisation to fewer than 370.
Locomotive classes.
Of the remaining 359 locomotives, all were robust, two-cylinder tender engines to seven classes. The vast majority were to two ex-LMS classes designed by William Stanier; 151 ex-LMS Black Fives and 150 ex-LMS 8Fs. The remaining 58 were an assortment of four BR standard classes and one other ex-LMS class. All were based on the London Midland Region. They were employed mostly on freight workings in industrial North-West England. Main line steam would end with the Fifteen Guinea Special on 11 August 1968.
Departmental stock.
Departmental stock was numbered in a different series to the capital stock.
Post-1967 survivals.
The locomotives of the Vale of Rheidol Railway, narrow gauge, acquired from the GWR but which had been transferred to the London Midland Region survived the end of main line steam, remaining in BR stock until 1989 when the VoR was privatised and preserved. There were also three ex-LNER Thompson Class B1s in departmental stock used as carriage heaters on the Eastern Region. These latter engines had their couplings removed so they could not haul trains, though they could still propel themselves. These were withdrawn in 1968.

Crawford was born in London the son of Andrew Crawford, formerly of Dunfermline, and his wife Mary Spink. He spent his early life with the Honourable East India Company and made a fortune in India. He returned to England in around 1812, and was a partner in the East India Mercantile House (i.e. trading company) of Crawford, Colvin and Company. (See the Colvin family for more on the Anglo-Indian links.) He bought the estate of Pippbrook, near Dorking, Surrey in 1817 and made it his country home. In 1827 he was High Sheriff of Surrey. 
He also had a house at Eaton Square, in the fashionable West End of London. He was a director of the Alliance Assurance Company and an alderman of the City of London in the Spectacle Makers' Company.

Better (Tom Baxter song)

"Better" was recorded by Boyzone and released as the second and final single from their second greatest hits compilation, "Back Again... No Matter What".
Background.
It was originally recorded and released as part of the album "Skybound", released by independent British singer-songwriter Tom Baxter in January 2008. Baxter's version was also used on the soundtrack for the motion picture "Run Fatboy Run". Boyzone's version of the song features both Ronan Keating and Stephen Gately on lead vocals. The single received less promotion than "Love You Anyway", due to the band's tour commitments. As such, it charted much lower selling 30,000 copies.
Music video.
The music video for "Better" premiered on 14 October 2008. The entire video was shot in black and white, with each member of the group singing to a woman he is holding - with the exception of Stephen Gately, who is shown singing to a man - the first time a Boyzone video has depicted a same-sex love interest. The video marks the last appearance for Gately in a Boyzone video, due to his death in October 2009.

<doc id="20452358" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20452358" title="Duckie (group)">
Duckie (group)

Duckie is a collective of performance artists that describes itself as “a post-gay independent arts outfit.” They produce a mix of so-called "cultural interventions", such as club nights, new-mode pop, burlesque and performance events, as well as anti-theatre experimentation. They have described their work as "mixing the arthouse with the dosshouse" and putting "highbrow performance in backstreet pubs and lowbrow performance in posh theatres".
Supported by grants from the British Council and Arts Council England, Duckie is based in London but has played in Berlin, Germany, Greece and Tokyo as well as the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Blackpool Tower Ballroom and the Sydney Opera House. It continues to run cabaret and club nights every Saturday at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern (also known by its abbreviation, the RVT) and counts an Olivier Award for its show "C’est Barbican" amongst its accolades.
Duckie’s work is characterised by its engagement with the queer lifestyle and community, showcasing queer performers and performance art at its weekly Saturday club night and providing “a creative forum for alternative gay and lesbian performance and culture”. Other focusses include anti-class and anti-corporate ideals, including a rejection of corporate culture and gay commercial culture. This latter is highlighted in Duckie’s highly successful "Gay Shame" events, produced annually between 1996 and 2009 as an alternative to Gay Pride.
The company’s outlook is distinctly working-class, drawing influences in John McGrath, the Victorian music hall, punk culture and illegitimate theatre.
Background.
The collective dates back to a club night called "Duckie" that started in November 1995 in south London pub the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, created by producer Simon Casson – also known as “Simon Strange” – and compere Amy Lamé. They were joined by DJs Mark Wood and Mark Johnston - who called themselves The Readers Wifes - and box office artistes under the name of “Father Cloth and Jay Cloth”. Further members of the collective include Dicky Eton, Casson's co-producer, Mark Whitelaw and Robin Whitmore, director and designer for Duckie's larger shows respectively.
Burston indicates that at the start of Duckie’s tenure the RVT was somewhat in decline: “Lack of investment meant the venue remained dark during the week, only coming to life at the weekend with Duckie and … the Dame Edna Experience.” Burston also records that the opening of the gay nightclub Crash promoted Vauxhall’s potential for hosting such ventures, leading an influx of mainstream clubs into the historic gay area. The survival of Duckie, positioned in direct opposition to mainstream commercialised gay culture, highlights the effectiveness of their niche appeal. 
Despite this, and the potential in new audiences attracted by the larger clubs, Duckie’s growth was again challenged in 1998 when Lambeth Council and property developer CLS Holdings attempted to flatten the RVT to make way for a supermarket complex. Duckie was instrumental in defeating this threat: as Burston notes “The performance club Duckie, which had breathed new life into Saturday nights, mounted a vigorous press campaign, protesting outside Lambeth Town Hall and saving it from the bulldozers.” In 2005, businessmen Paul Oxley and James Lindsay bought the RVT at public auction, bringing new investment to the venue and providing Duckie’s Saturday nightclub with a secure location into the foreseeable future.
Performance events.
In December 2002, Duckie’s Christmas show at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern created the format of sitting guests at tables and offering them the chance to order short acts, using "Duckie dollars", from a menu. This was recreated at The Pit at the Barbican in December 2003 as "C’est Barbican". It won four awards including an Olivier Award for best entertainment show and returned to the Barbican in 2004. The show toured to the Sydney Opera House as well as Berlin, Thessaloniki, Birmingham and Manchester.
In December 2007, this show was recreated as "C’est Duckie!" at the CSV Cultural Center on the Lower East Side, New York City.
In 2006, Duckie created "The Class Club" at The Pit, Barbican, a piece of event theatre that asked the audience to pre-select a social class for themselves, dress appropriately for the evening and then enjoy a meal and entertainment for their chosen grouping.
Leading cabaret performers Chris Green and Ursula Martinez have worked as part of Duckie, and it has also attracted performers such as Dusty Limits, Janice Connolly, Scott Capurro and Kiki and Herb.
Productions.
As noted above, Duckie’s first theatrical venture was the creation of the "Duckie" clubnight at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, which has run weekly since its inception in 1995.

, also known as Ichiyusai Hirokage, was a Japanese designer of ukiyo-e woodblock prints, who was active from about 1855 to 1865. He was a pupil of Utagawa Hiroshige I. From 1860 to 1861, Hirokage designed the series of ōban size prints titled "Edo meisho dōke zukushi" (Joyful Events in Famous Places in Edo). His reputation is based primarily upon this series and his 1859 triptych "Aomono sakana gunzei daikassen no zu" (The Great Battle between the Fruits and Vegetables and the Fish).

Sanela Diana Jenkins

Sanela Diana Jenkins (born in 1973 as Sanela Ćatić in Sarajevo) is a Bosnian entrepreneur and philanthropist. She currently resides in California. Jenkins fled her home country during the Siege of Sarajevo and emigrated to London, where she studied at City University, London.
Early life.
Born in Sarajevo, Jenkins is the elder of two children in a middle-class Bosniak family. Her mother was an accountant and her father was an economist. She grew up in the concrete-block apartments that characterized communist-era Yugoslavia. Jenkins studied economics at the University of Sarajevo, but the outbreak of war in 1992 forced her to flee her home and spend more than a year in Croatia as a refugee before emigrating to London.
Career.
While still a student in London, she acquired the swimwear line Melissa Odabash.
She produced a photography book entitled "Room 23," photographed by Deborah Anderson. Many of the celebrities in the book are friends of Jenkins, including George Clooney and Elton John. Proceeds from the sale of the book benefit several philanthropic programs.
In 2009, Jenkins created and launched the Neuro line of functional beverages. Based in Santa Monica, Neuro produces drinks with natural ingredients and packaged with recycled materials. Neuro products are distributed in the United States and sold at nationwide retail chains including Target Corporation, Walgreens, Safeway Inc, and Seven Eleven. The drinks aim to fill a variety of needs over the course of the day and include such descriptive names as Passion, Sleep, Sonic, Trim, Daily, and Bliss.
In 2012, Diana launched D Empire Entertainment, a full service Media/Music label whose collaborators include multi-platinum recording artists and producers like One Republic front man Ryan Tedder, Chris Brown, Sean Kingston and will be releasing the breakout album of flagship artist Asher Monroe later in 2013.
Philanthropic activities.
Diana Jenkins established The Irnis Catic Foundation in 2002 in memory of her brother who was killed by Serbs. The foundation provides essential funding to the medical facilities at the University of Sarajevo. In 2009, Diana Jenkins was awarded the Peace Connection prize by the Center for Peace and Multi-Ethnic Cooperation. Past winners have included Bono and Nelson Mandela.
She established the Sanela Diana Jenkins Human Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles in August 2008. The clinic concentrates on legal advocacy, political advocacy and documentation. It is the first endowed program on international justice and human rights at any law school in the western United States.
Immediately following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Jenkins and actor Sean Penn established the Jenkins-Penn Haitian Relief Organization to deliver hospital supplies and provide medical care to thousands of displaced Haitians. She compared the long-term recovery in Haiti to that in Bosnia, highlighted the need for basic humanitarian aid, and argued that the U.S. military should not leave the country prematurely.
A supporter of AIDS research, Jenkins has organized and hosted fundraisers for the Elton John AIDS Foundation. On 7 March 2010, Jenkins and Neuro sponsored and co-chaired the Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party. The event raised $3.7 million. In October 2009, she co-hosted with Jimmy Choo founder Tamara Mellon the launch of Project PEP in support of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. She now remains an active fundraiser for the Elton John AIDS Foundation and the Clinton Foundation.
In March 2010, Jenkins posted bail for former Bosnian President Ejup Ganić, who was detained in London on a Serbian extradition request.
In August 2010 her TV station TV1, which has its headquarters in Sarajevo will start to air its program.
Personal life.
In 1999, she married banker Roger Jenkins. The couple met at the gym at the Barbican, where Jenkins was living after the end of his marriage to his first wife, a banker at Barclays. They have two children together. She received an estimated £150million after her ten-year marriage to Jenkins. The estranged couple called their 2011 split as ‘the happiest divorce ever’ and as she joined him among Britain’s wealthiest 500 individuals in 2012.

Clarence Miles

Clarence Miles (June 29, 1897 – October 8, 1977) was the chairman of the board and president of the Baltimore Orioles of the American League during the and seasons.
Miles was a native of the Eastern Shore. He had gone to school with Wallis Warfield. In 1924, he founded what would become one of Baltimore's more prominent law firms, Miles & Stockbridge.
In 1952, he joined forces with Mayor Tommy D'Alesandro to bring a major league team to Baltimore. After a year of searching, they found an apparent candidate in the moribund St. Louis Browns. Their owner, Bill Veeck, had recently been broadsided by the sale of the St. Louis Cardinals to Anheuser-Busch. While Veeck had mounted a considerable effort over the past two years to drive the Cardinals out of St. Louis, he'd concluded he could not possibly compete against a team with Anheuser-Busch's resources behind it and was looking to move elsewhere. 
Veeck had wanted to move the Browns to Baltimore himself for the 1953 season, but was voted down. After the season, Veeck cut a deal with Miles and D'Alesandro in which Miles and other Baltimore investors would buy half of Veeck's 80 percent stake in the Browns, with Veeck remaining as principal owner. The proposal required six out of eight owners to vote in favor, but at an owners' meeting in New York City on September 27, only four voted aye, reportedly because Yankees co-owner Del Webb was rounding up support to move the Browns to Los Angeles. 
Miles realized that the owners merely wanted Veeck out of the way. In 48 hours, he lined up enough support from several of the Baltimore investors in the original deal with Veeck—such as brewer Jerold Hoffberger, investment banker Joseph Iglehart and real estate developer James Keelty—to buy out Veeck's interest for $2.5 million. This deal, along with the planned move to Baltimore, was unanimously approved. Almost immediately, Miles announced the team would be renamed the Orioles.
With his fellow investors both frustrated with his domination of the team's business operations and dissatisfied with a pair of seventh place finishes, Miles resigned in early November, 1955. Keelty succeeded him as president with Iglehart becoming board chairman. Miles died in Queenstown, Maryland, in October 1977.

Ken Day (cricketer)

Frederick George Kenneth "Ken" Day (born 25 June 1919 in Yatton, Somerset – died 9 December 1991 in Whitchurch, Bristol) played first-class cricket for Somerset in seven matches in 1950 and 1956.
An amateur right-handed batsman and a wicketkeeper, Day played in a first-class early-season friendly match for Somerset against Glamorgan in 1950, making 29 not out and 4 in the two innings, and making four stumpings. But with the reliable and normally fit Harold Stephenson as the regular Somerset wicketkeeper, and the county not running, until 1956, a regular second eleven, Day went back into Bristol club cricket, where he was a wicketkeeper and opening batsman for Knowle Cricket Club. 
It was in 1956 that Day reappeared in first-class cricket. Stephenson was injured early in the season and Day played in six consecutive matches across the month of May. His wicketkeeping, said Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, showed "much ability" and he also proved capable with the bat. In his first match, he made 43 of the last 58 runs in Somerset's only innings against Leicestershire at Taunton. And the following game, he made an unbeaten 56 out of 85 at Old Trafford against a Lancashire attack that included Brian Statham, Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton. 
At the end of May, Stephenson returned to the Somerset side and Day did not play first-class cricket again. "In different circumstances," says one directory of Somerset cricketers, "he could well have established himself at county level. As a batsman he took few risks, scoring more than 30 centuries for Knowle CC as a reward for that diligence."

Cordy Ryman

Cordy Ryman (born 1971, New York City), an artist based in New York City. Ryman earned his BFA with Honors in Fine Arts and Art Education from The School of Visual Arts in New York in 1997. He is the son of artist Robert Ryman. 
Works.
Ryman’s early works were emotion based figurative sculptures but within his first year at art school he began to experiment with abstract representations. During his second year at The School of Visual Arts he was working on small scale collages. This is where Ryman began to develop his current style.
Ryman’s artwork is characterized by recycled wood and metal painted and reconstructed with sculptural elements, mimicking the traditional canvas in their display. The materials Ryman uses include wood, gorilla glue, scrap metals, studio sweepings, acrylic and enamel paints and other found objects. When working with wood, he often keeps the rough jagged edges visible. This creates a very tactile surface. Ryman alters the surfaces of his artwork to change the appearance but still allows for the character of the materials to be recognized. 
He sometimes combines mostly mute colors-white, silver, and creamy oranges- with small touches of bright hues on the edges and seams of his work. The end result is a fluorescent glow that is reflected onto the gallery spaces and the artwork itself. In a 2009 interview with Phong Bui in The Brooklyn Rail, Ryman says of his attention to the edges of his paintings: "I guess the main thing about the edges and the sides is that I think about them. In one way or another they are considered. When the sides are painted or accounted for in some way, it makes the piece as a whole seem more like a thing or an independent entity as opposed to a picture of something." 
His works range from small to large and often interact with the spaces in which they are presented. When Ryman works on a smaller scale his paintings tend to be saturated with paint transforming the nature of the scrap materials he works with. The undulating surfaces of these works push the boundary between sculpture and painting. 
When Ryman creates work on a larger scale the pieces interact with unique properties of the installation space. Such pieces are found in the corners of spaces or rising and falling from the walls. In Ryman’s 2010 solo exhibition at DCKT Contemporary he showed the work Red Brick which consisted of a series of cut and painted wooden “bricks” stacked upon one another in varying shades of red and pink. In this work Ryman questions geometry, order, and the nature of painting itself.

Nieuport-Delage NiD 42

__NOTOC__
The Nieuport-Delage NiD 42 was a fighter aircraft built in France in the early 1920s, the first in a family of designs that would form the backbone of the French fighter force over the next decade. 
Design and development.
As first built, the NiD 42 was a highly-streamlined parasol-wing monoplane with a monocoque fuselage and an open cockpit of which a single prototype was built. Soon afterwards, Nieuport-Delage building two examples of a modified version for the 1924 Coupe Beaumont as the NiD 42S, on which the main wings were mounted directly to the sides of the upper fuselage at shoulder position and a short subsidiary wing fitted around the undercarriage axle.. To further streamline the design, the surface radiators were installed on the upper surface of the wing.
Operational history.
One of these aircraft was flown by Joseph Sadi Lecointe in the race of 22 June and was the only one out of the five entrants to actually finish the course. Indeed, having finished the prescribed six laps of the course, Sadi-Lecointe flew another four laps to break the world speed record over a 500-km closed-course. His average speed in winning the Coupe Beaumont was and over the was , beating the previous record for the latter by . On 15 February the following year, Sadi Lecointe took a NiD 42S up to a speed of and went on to win the 1925 Coupe Beaumont with a NiD 42S on 18 October with an average speed of .
While the NiD 42S was achieving these distinctions, development continued on the fighter version. Nieuport-Delage designed two further such variants in 1924; a single-seater designated NiD 42 C.1 and a similar machine with a second cockpit for a tail gunner with a machine gun in a ring mount, designated the NiD 42 C.2. One of the latter was exhibited at that year's "Salon de l'Aéronautique", along with a NiD 42 C.1 nose section to illustrate an alternative engine mount. These differed from the original NiD 42 fighter in having a second, small wing added to the lower fuselage, turning the parasol monoplane into a sesquiplane; a design feature adopted from the NiD 37 and which would be a key identifying feature through most of the versions developed from the 42.
Only two examples of the two-seater were built, but Nieuport-Delage entered the single-seater in the 1925 "concours des monoplaces", a competition by the Army's Technical Service to find a replacement for the NiD 29. The NiD 42 was selected from a field of eleven competitors, and an order for 50 aircraft was placed, of which 25 were eventually delivered. Although impressive at the time it was designed, technology had already surpassed the NiD 42 when it entered service in 1928, particularly with regard to its wooden structure, and most of the development work associated with the design was made in an effort to cure it of a tendency to enter a flat spin. Nevertheless, it provided the foundation for further development as the NiD 52 and NiD 62.

Florence and Keyport Plank Road

The Florence and Keyport Plank Road was a partially built plank road in New Jersey.
The Florence & Keyport Company was chartered in Monmouth County, New Jersey on March 1, 1850. The Florence & Keyport Joint Companies were chartered in Monmouth County on August 17, 1853; one object of the company was "“the construction of and maintenance of Roads leading to and from said depots, on which said business may be done, and also to purchase and hold the stock of such Road Companies or other corporations as will extend the business of this Company and promote the object of its organization.”"
Intended as a toll road to run from Florence, Burlington County, on the Delaware River to a point (now Union Beach) near Keyport on Raritan Bay. The only part planked was beginning at the foot of Dock Street, Union Beach, thence up Dock to State Street (now Florence Avenue, part of County Route 39 ), thence southwest to end at Main Street, Keyport (now County Route 4. Here was as far as they got with the planked surface. It is known that the planking was proposed to continue along Clark Street to approximately Beers Street, from which it was to set off in a southwesterly direction, crossing into Hazlet and Aberdeen Townships and intersecting Lloyd Road and Church Street. From there it was to follow Lloyd Road to the Monmouth County Plank Road (the present New Jersey Route 79). 
The segment west of Beers Street was laid out as a public road on May 13, 1859. This road return was the subject of two caveats filed against it: One from William W. Ackerson, through whose land it was to run, and one from the Township Committee as a body. As a result, on February 23, 1860, a committee of the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders voted to quash this road return as “unnecessary and injurious."
Also laid out on May 13, 1859 was that portion between the present Reid's Hill Road and New Jersey Route 79; this segment was opened to the public and became known as Lloyd Road.

Bombay Vikings

"Bombay Vikings"' are a pop group that combine Indian filmi and classical music, formed in 1994 in Stockholm, Sweden. The band was started by Neeraj Shridhar, Oscar Söderberg, and Mats Nordenborg, and became popular with remixes of old Bollywood hits such as "Kya Soorat Hai", "Woh Chali" and "Chod Do Anchal".
The group was popular both in India and Pakistan, as well as overseas among the Indian music community, due to its unusual combination of classic Bollywood style and European experimentation. It was the first group to sing in Hinglish, a mix of Hindi and English, a brainchild of its front-man, Neeraj Shridhar.
History.
Formation.
Bombay Vikings were formed in 1994 in Stockholm, Sweden. The three experienced musicians met when Mats introduced Neeraj Shridhar and Oscar Soderberg to each other. The band was born primarily due to a common interest of Indian melodies from sources such as Hindi films and classical music. Neeraj became the lead vocalist and back-up guitar, and also composed pop rock, jazz, hip-hop, soul, and reggae songs. Mats played the saxophone; as a jazz specialist, he used this knowledge while composing for the new band. Mats and Johan Folke, keyboard specialists, used their years of exposure to the different genres of music on the synthesizer. They were soon joined by Morgan on the drums, Par on the bass, and Staffan as the lead guitarist. Bombay Vikings began performing live shows in Sweden and Norway. When all the musicians got together and began jamming, they didn't know they would be coming out with a new form of music, but they wanted to do something creative for India.
The leader of Bombay Vikings, Neeraj Shridhar, is from Jalandhar in Punjab, India. He moved to Sweden when he was 13, where he developed his interest for music. He enjoyed listening to western and Indian classical songs. He formed Bombay Vikings in 1994 and performed at many places in Europe. The band mainly performed English songs with Neeraj adding an Indian influence. After a few years, most of the band members disbanded, but Neeraj chose to keep the name of the band and form another band with the remaining members.
"Kya Soorat Hai" (1999).
Neeraj produced his first album, "Kya Soorat Hai", in 1999, after stopping the project for almost four years. Most of the Indian music companies didn't think the album would be popular among the Indians due to its strong English and Western influence and demanded changes. Finally, Sony BMG agreed to produce the album in India without any changes. The album consisted of eight tracks, all of which were remakes of old Indian songs. Every song was recorded primarily in English, with two to three songs containing a few lines of Hindi. In spite of this, the album was a huge success in India and opened the doors for westernization of music. The songs "Kya Soorat Hai", "Mona Re" and "Night Is So Perfect" were popular among teenagers. The video of the song "Kya Soorat Hai" starred South-Indian star Prabhu Deva's brother and was a hit due to its hip-hop sound. The song "Mona Re" was also made into a video.
"Woh Chali" (2000).
Soon after the success of their first album, Bombay Vikings recorded another successful album, "Woh Chali", in 2000. The album contained four remakes of old songs and five original songs, in which Neeraj Shridhar, who wanted to be known as a modern music composer, attempted to silence the critics who said he simply "copy and pasted." All of the songs on this album were hits, especially "Woh Chali", "Jambola", "Angel Eyes", and "Jump Up". "Angel Eyes" was also an international success.
Singer Lata Mangeshkar was impressed with the remake of her song "Main Chali" and invited Neeraj to perform at her birthday function. 
Three songs of the album were made into videos: "Woh Chali", "Jambola" and "Angel Eyes".
"Hawa Mein Udata Jaaye" and "Best of".
In 2002, Bombay Vikings released another album, "Hawa Mein Udati Jaaye'. This album again revived old songs in a modern way, making the youth admire the beauty of the old songs. This time, Neeraj worked with guest singers Linnea Spores and Falguni Pathak to produce songs. The videos of the songs "Hawa Mein Udati Jaaye" and "Tera Mera Pyaar Sanam" became hits. In the same year, the album "The Best Of Bombay Vikings" was released, with a playback song of the film "Rules: "Pyaar Ka Superhit Formula", in which Neeraj sang "Kabhi Phool Dena" for music director Sandesh Shandilya.
"Chhodh Do Aanchal Zamana Kya Kahega" and "Fusion Remixes" (2004).
In 2004, Bombay Vikings came up with "Chhodh Do Aanchal Zamana Kya Kahega". The title track had the main lines sung again by Linea and was a hit along with its video, which was played on every music channel for almost a year. The youthful songs "Ik Badal" and "Aa Raha Hoon Main" were "milestones", and the video of the song "Aa Raha Hoon Main" was a commercial hit. In the same year, Neeraj produced a single titled "Hum To Anything Karega', a remake of the song "Hum To Mohabbat Karega'. This song with Neeraj's previous few hits, and the songs of other artists such as Falguni Pathak, were released in the album "Fusion Remixes".

Raúl de Ramón

Raúl de Ramón, full name Raúl Alberto de Ramón García del Postigo, (May 12, 1929, Santiago de Chile — April 1984) was a Chilean composer, musician and folklorist and author of numerous widely known songs in Chile, such as "The Curanto", "Nostalgia Colchaguina", "Camino de Soledad", "Rosa Colorada", "Canción de la Caballería", "El Amor del Arriero" and a many more. 
He married María Eugenia Silva Fuentes and together they produced two children, Carlos Alberto (lawyer), and Raúl Eduardo (neurosurgeon). He performed alongside his wife and his two children in the group Los de Ramón with whom he traveled and presented Chilean music in the entire U.S.A. Throughout his career he performed in more than 92 concerts and travelled throughout Mexico and the rest of the countries of Latin America.
Education.
De Ramón studied at The Grange School in Santiago and soon graduated as an architect from the Catholic University of Chile. He spent an important part of its youth in the country in the Colchagua Province where he became absorbed by the fundamentals of the Chilean culture of the Central Zone, crossing it by horse and taking feeling of its roots, falling in love deeply with the basis of Chilean heritage which would be reflected widely in his later work.
Career.
He formed his first group while in University. It was called "Los Huincas" with his childhood friend Rogelio Muñoz. Afterwards he and his wife formed Los de Ramón into which he later integrated his two children. Not only did he investigate and carry out a deep study into Chilean folklore but he also did the same with Latin American folklore. Along with his wife he collected an extensive compilation of songs, rhythms and clothes from the different countries.
They held meetings in their house with folklorists from all the countries of Latin America where their music was sung. Persons sometimes referred to these meetings as a small O.A.S. In their productions they sung songs from all the Latin American countries, each interpreted with the instruments typical of each country. They used more than sixty different instruments played all by themselves. They also recorded songs from the north, center and south of Chile. Some of their published CDs include: "Arreo en el Viento", "Nostalgia Colchaguina", "An image of Chile", "Human Landscape of Chile", "Latin American Folkloric Panorama" (published in Mexico, 2 longplays), "Los de Ramón in Family" and "Chilean Mass", among others.
Raúl de Ramón also helped with the formation of new Chilean folk music groups such as Los Cantores de Santa Cruz, Los de Santiago and others. 
His impact went beyond the music. He contributed towards the construction of Chilean houses and the introduction of a "Chilean Mass". He even published, in France, the creation of a still unpublished musical comedy. He opened a restaurant, El Alero de los de Ramón, where Chilean music was played and typical Chilean food was eaten. He was named "Illustrious Son of Santa Cruz" for his collaboration to this city and has, together with his family, a place at the Museum of Colchagua in this city. He died in April in 1984 at 55 years of age.
Works.
With his family, he recorded more than thirteen long plays, two of them in Mexico, using his own creations and with compilations of folklore music from throughout Latin America. He also published some books on Chilean literature, including, "El Caballero y sus Dragones" a rural Chilean novel; "Raíces en la Bruma", a poetry book, and "Arreo en el Viento", a compilation of important parts of his musical work.

<doc id="20452893" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20452893" title="Karapiro Power Station">
Karapiro Power Station

The Karapiro Power Station is a hydroelectric power station on Waikato River, in the North Island of New Zealand. The power station station lies on Lake Karapiro, upstream from the city of Hamilton. Karapiro is the last of the eight hydroelectric power stations on the Waikato River.
Karapiro is a baseload power station, as it is required to maintain water flow in the lower Waikato River even during low inflows to the catchment and during low electricity demand. Only two turbines are required to keep the river flow at a reasonable level, with the third turbine being available for peak generation and maintenance on one of the other turbines.
Like all of the hydroelectric power stations on the Waikato River, Karapiro is operated by state-owned electricity generator Mighty River Power.
History.
Karapiro was the second power station built of the Waikato hydro scheme. Construction of the dam and power station began in 1940, but material and labour shortage due to World War II meant progress was slow. The station was completed in 1947, four years behind schedule. 
The creation of Lake Karapiro behind the dam flooded the Horahora Power Station, the first power station built on the Waikato River.
The bridge over the spillway is the only road access to the turbine hall. The first bridge had a supporting column in the center of the bridge. The bridge was destroyed by the water running through the spillway in a significant flood event (Source: Mighty River Photo archives). The replacement bridge is as you see today with no supporting column.
To the left of the four spillway gates are three siphon tubes. These were designed for the management of the lake level under normal river flow and the spillway gates were to be used in only extreme conditions. The design of the siphon tubes was faulty: The flow of water was supposed to be stopped by a blast of air, but this never worked properly - resulting in the spillway gates to be used for lake level control.
Generation.
Karapiro's powerhouse is located on the northern bank of the river, with a diversion tunnel and spillway also on the northern bank. The river is dammed by a concrete arch dam south of the powerhouse, with the electricity substation on the southern bank of the river.
Water from Lake Karapiro runs through the penstocks to three Kaplan turbines. Each turbine turns a generator, outputting 32 megawatts of electricity each at 11,000 volts. Around of water every second is required to run through the turbines to generate 1 MW of electricity.
Karapiro is controlled remotely by Mighty River Power's Waikato River control room in Hamilton.
Transmission.
Electricity generated by Karapiro is stepped-up at the powerhouse to 110 kV, and then is sent across the dam to the Karapiro substation on the other side. Karapiro, along with Arapuni, connect to the 110 kV grid, rather than the 220 kV grid like other stations on the Waikato River.
From Karapiro, electricity is transmitted by a twin-circuit 110 kV line (HAM-KPO-A) to Hamilton, via Cambridge, where Karapiro's electricity is distributed to Hamilton, northern Waikato, and Auckland. Electricity from Karapiro is also distributed via two single-circuit 110 kV lines to Te Awamutu (KPO-TMU-A) and Hinerua, near Matamata (HIN-KPO-A).

PicoSAT

PicoSAT, launched on September 30, 2001, is a real time tracking satellite. The name "PICO" combines the first letters of all four of its experiments (see below). PICOSat series are designed for a minimum of one year of on-orbit operations.
Background.
The name Picosat was coined by Peter P. Vekinis and was used to describe a constellation of amateur radio satellites, called the Picosat System, first analog, then digital, that would offer instant emergency communications, worldwide, using cheap amateur radio transceivers. The details were presented at AMSAT's conference in Orlando, Florida, in 1995 and in Tucson, Arizona, in 1996.
History.
Early versions.
Tethered Picosats, Picosat 5, Picosat 6, Picosat 7, and Picosat 8 are hectogram mass satellites that were ejected from OPAL (2000-004C). The primary builders were by engineering students at Santa Clara University in California. They used off-the-shelf components and miniature batteries, for technology tests. The Tethered Picosats were a pair of Picosats tethered together by a short wire, was ejected on February 8, 2000, from an OPAL Launch System. Picosats 7 and 8 on launched on 11 February, and Picosats 5 and 6 launched on 12 February. Alternate common names were given by the investigators: Picosats 7 and 8 are the Thelma and Louise pair and Picosats 5 and 6 are the JAK and Stensat pair. The Tethered Picosats were functional for a short time after ejection, communicating with each other by microwatt radio transmitters. There was no indication if the Picosats (5, 6, 7,and 8) were operational at the time of ejection into orbit. USSPACECOM's Picosat numbers extending to eight is erroneous. There were only six Picosats on board the OPAL, with possibly one or two still on the ground, with tests to communicate with the orbiters. The tests were managed by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA).
Current version.
The current Picosat 9 is a British-built (US DOD-funded) microsatellite (67 kg) to test electronic components/systems in space conditions. Oboard this model carries four test payloads: Polymer Battery Experiment (PBEX), Ionospheric Occultation Experiment (IOX), Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography (CERTO) and On Orbit Mission Control (OOMC) an ultra-quiet platform (OPPEX). PICOSat flies in a 800 km circular orbit with a 67 degree inclination. PICOSat uses a gravity gradient boom for stabilization. The body mounted solar panels produce an average on orbit power of 22 W. The Ultra-Quiet Platform (UQP), developed by the US Air Force Research Lab, aims to provide a 10:1 reduction in vibration isolation over a 100 Hz bandwidth between the spacecraft bus and a science payload.

G 2/06 is a decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO), which was issued on November 25, 2008. The Enlarged Board of Appeal decided that, under the European Patent Convention (EPC), a patent cannot be granted for an invention which necessarily involves the use and destruction of human embryos. The decision notably refers to the provisions of EU Directive 98/44/EC of 6 July 1998 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, referred to in .
The reactions to the decision were mixed. According to Reuters, the decision could stifle research by stem cell companies for commercial purposes. In contrast, according to the Guardian, "some experts believe this will provide a boost for European companies developing technologies based on human embryonic stem cells".

The Van Wagenen House, also known as "Apple Tree House" is located near Bergen Square in Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey, United States. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 16, 2006.
History.
The house was built in 1688, making it the oldest building in Jersey City.There was an addition added in the 1820s. 
The house may have been the site of a meeting between George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette in 1779. The name "Apple Tree House" is given to the home because of a former apple orchard and cider press that were located on the property. The house was purchased by the Quinn family and used as a funeral parlor for a number of years. 
In 1996, the house was on Preservation New Jersey's "10 Most Endangered Historic Sites" list. The city of Jersey City purchased the building in 1999 and has been working to improve the condition of the building. The New Jersey Historic Trust gave Jersey City a grant in 2006 for interior restoration and accessibility improvements. Jersey City plans to use the house as a museum. Renovations were completed in 2014.
