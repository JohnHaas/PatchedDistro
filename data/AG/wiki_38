George Henry Harlow

George Henry Harlow (10 June 1787 – 4 February 1819), was a highly regarded English portrait painter.
Life.
Harlow was born in St. James's Street, London, the posthumous son of a China merchant, who after some years' residence in the East had died about five months before his son's birth, leaving a widow with five infant daughters. Indulged and petted by his mother, Harlow was sent when quite young to Dr. Barrow's classical school in Soho Square, and subsequently to Mr. Roy's school in Burlington Street. He was for a short time at Westminster School, but having shown a predilection for painting, he was placed under Henry De Cort, the landscape-painter. He next worked under Samuel Drummond, A.R.A., the portrait-painter, but after about a year entered the studio of Sir Thomas Lawrence (president of the Royal Academy). This step is said to have been taken at the suggestion of Georgiana, duchess of Devonshire; but Harlow's natural affinity to Lawrence's style in painting would be quite sufficient to account for his choice. Harlow paid Lawrence handsomely for his admission and the right to copy, but according to the contract was not entitled to instruction.
Harlow now determined to devote himself to painting, and refused an offer of a writership in the East India trade made by his father's friends. He remained for about eighteen months in Lawrence's studio, copying his pictures, and occasionally drawing preliminary portions of Lawrence's own productions. A difference about Harlow's work for one of Lawrence's pictures led to a breach with Lawrence, and Harlow rendered reconciliation impossible by painting a caricature signboard for an inn at Epsom in Lawrence's style and with Lawrence's initials affixed to it.
Harlow henceforth pursued an original system of art education. He inveighed strongly against all academical rules and principles. Young, headstrong, and impatient of restraint, with a handsome person and amiable disposition, he was generally popular in society. He affected, however, an extravagance in dress far beyond his means, a superiority of knowledge, and a license of conversation which gave frequent offence even to those really interested in the development of his genius. His foibles led his friends to nickname him "Clarissa Harlowe." He worked, however, with industry and enthusiasm in his art. He possessed a power of rapid observation and a retentive memory which enabled him to perform astonishing feats, like that of painting a satisfactory portrait of a gentleman named Hare, lately dead, whom Harlow had only once met in the street. Though openly opposed to the Royal Academy, he was a candidate for academician, but he only received the vote of Henry Fuseli.
He exhibited for the first time at the Academy in 1804, sending a portrait of Dr. Thornton. In later years he exhibited many other portraits. His practice in this line was extensive. His portraits are well conceived, and, though much in the manner and style of Lawrence, have a character of their own. His portraits of ladies were always graceful and pleasing. He was less successful, owing to his defective art-education, in historical painting, in which he aspired to excel. His first exhibited historical pictures were "Queen Elizabeth striking the Earl of Essex", at the Royal Academy, 1807, and "The Earl of Bolingbroke entering London", at the British Institution, 1808.
In 1815 he painted "Hubert and Prince Arthur" for William Leader, a wealthy M.P.,who subsequently exchanged the picture for portraits of his daughters. In 1814 he painted a set of portraits of the actor Charles Mathews in various characters, which attracted general attention. It was engraved by W. Greatbach for Yate's "Life of Mathews". Harlow received a commission from the music teacher Thomas Welsh to paint a portrait of Mrs. Siddons as Queen Katharine in Shakespeare's "Henry VIII". This was commenced from memory, but subsequently the actress, at Welsh's request, gave the painter a sitting. While painting the portrait, Harlow resolved to expand the picture into the "Trial Scene" from the same play, introducing portraits of the various members of the Kemble family and others. Welch, though not consulted by Harlow concerning this change of plan, behaved generously. The picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817, and excited great public interest. It was neither well composed nor well executed, and owed much to the criticism and suggestions of Fuseli, whose portrait Harlow was painting at the time. Still, the portrait of Mrs. Siddons herself as the queen will remain one of the most striking figures in English art. The fine engraving of it in mezzotint hy George Clint has enhanced its reputation. The picture passed eventually into the possession of Mr. Morrison at Basildon Park, Berkshire. It was exhibited at Manchester in 1857.
Harlow's next picture, "The Virtue of Faith", at the Royal Academy, lacked originality, and had less success. It was purchased by his friend Mr. Tomkisson, who divided it into pieces for the sake of the heads.
In 1818 Harlow, conscious of deficiencies in his executive powers, visited Italy to study the old masters. At Rome his personal gifts and accomplishments, and his remarkable powers of execution, made him the hero of the day. He was fêted and flattered in every direction. Canova was especially attracted by him, and obtained him an introduction to the pope. Harlow, however, worked very hard, and completed a copy of Raphael's "Transfiguration" in eighteen days. He was elected a member for merit of the Academy of St. Luke at Rome, an unusual distinction for an English artist, and was invited to paint a self-portrait for the Uffizi gallery of painters at Florence. He painted a picture of "Wolsey receiving the Cardinal's Hat in Westminster Abbey", and presented it to the Academy at Rome.
His artistic progress in Italy was remarkable, but on his return to England on 13 January 1819 he was seized with a glandular affection of the throat, which being neglected proved fatal on 4 February. He was in his thirty-second year. He was buried under the altar of St. James's, Piccadilly, and his funeral was attended by the eminent artists of the day. An exhibition of his principal works was held in Pall Mall. His collections, including many sketches, were sold by auction 21 June 1819.
Harlow is one of the most attractive figures in the history of English painting. His works only suggest what lie might have achieved. Many of his portraits have been engraved, and those of James Northcote, Fuseli, Thomas Stothard, William Beechey, John Flaxman, and others are highly esteemed. His self-portrait, painted for the gallery at Florence, was engraved for Ranalli's "Imperiale e Reale Galleria di Firenze". A drawing from it by J. Jackson, R.A., was bequeathed to the trustees of the National Portrait Gallery in 1888 by the painter's nephew, G. Harlow White. Another drawing by himself was engraved by B. Holl for the"Library of the Fine Arts". His own portrait is introduced in the background in the picture of "The Trial of Queen Katharine". A portrait of the Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV) by Harlow was engraved in mezzotint by W. Ward.

Reynier de Klerck

Reynier de Klerck (or Reinier de Klerck) (1710–1780) was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1778 until 1780.
De Klerk's date of birth is not known but he was baptised on 19 November 1710 in Middelburg. He worked as midshipman aboard the "Kamer van Zeeland", a warship, whose duty was to protect the routes of homeward bound cargo ships. He made two trips to India as a sailor in the service of the Dutch East India Company. In December 1730, he left permanently for India aboard the "t Vliegend Hert". 
Between 1735 and 1737 he was the pilot aboard a small ship which traded to and fro between Batavia and Padang. In 1737 he became an accountant (boekhouder) with the Dutch East India Company, and so began for him a life on land. In 1738, he was "onderkoopman" and "resident" (underbuyer/undermerchant and resident) in Lampung. In 1741 he was a secretary with the army on Java. In 1742 he became Chief in Surabaya and in 1744 "koopmand en eerste administrateur" (buyer/merchant and first administrator) in Semarang. In 1747, he was named "opperkoopmand en tweede bestuurder" (upperbuyer/uppermerchant and second in charge) of Java's Northeast Coast. In 1748 he became Governor and Director of Banda. He moved to Batavia/Jakarta in 1754 when he was made president of the "College van Boedelmeesteren der Chinesche en andere onchristelijke sterfhuizen" (which looked after Chinese and other non-Christian burial facilities) for Batavia. In October 1754, Reynier de Klerck was installed as "Counsellor-extraordinary of the Indies", and in 1762 was appointed as "Counsellor" in the Dutch Council of the Indies. In 1775 he became acting "Director-General", being named actual Director-General in 1776.
On 4 October 1777, the day after the death of Governor-General Jeremias van Riemsdijk, he was unanimously chosen as Governor-General. He took up the official functions of the post one year later, 9 October 1778. Reynier de Klerck was a hardworking governor. He was a powerful reformer, who however could not realise all his ideas. He was very committed to bringing Dutch culture to the Indies. Thus he wanted to replace Portugueseand Malay with Dutch in the education system. His endeavours failed however because the local population did not want this. During his term of office, few important happenings occurred. A conflict in the Celebes was brought to an end by occupying Gowa, while the Sultan of Bantam Landak and Batjan gave way to the Dutch East India Company. To preserve the spice monopoly, the Princes of Tidore and Batjan were deposed and sent into exile to Batavia. They were replaced by puppets of the Company. 
The term of office of van Reynier de Klerck did not last long, for he died on 1 September 1780 in Molenvliet near Batavia. He was followed as governor by Willem Arnold Alting.
Reynier de Klerck's house in old Batavia can still be seen, as the National Archives Museum on Jalan Gajah Mada, Jakarta.

Stateline Casino

Stateline Hotel and Casino was located in West Wendover straddling the Nevada/Utah border.
History.
The owner of Stateline Casino was William "Bill" Smith, who started his business in 1926 as a service station. In 1931 when gambling was legalized in Nevada, Smith expanded his service station adding a hotel and casino. The hotel and casino straddled the official border between Nevada and Utah. For a long time there was a white line across the floor. A patron could eat on the Utah side then step over the line and gamble in Nevada. It began business in 1931 when gambling became legal again in Nevada after being outlawed on October 1, 1910 at midnight.
It closed in 1982 and reopened in 1985. In 2002 it was sold and renamed the Stateline Nugget. In 2004 it was sold again and renamed Wendover Nugget Hotel and Casino. The Wendover Nugget Hotel and Casino then donated Wendover Will, the 63 foot neon cowboy sign that had stood in front of the hotel since 1952 to the city of West Wendover. The city restored it and erected it in the city center.

Nazi Literature in the Americas

Nazi Literature in the Americas ("La literatura Nazi en América" in Spanish) is a work of fiction by the Chilean author Roberto Bolaño. It was published in 1996. Chris Andrews’ English translation was published in 2008 by New Directions and was shortlisted for the 2008 Best Translated Book Award.
Summary.
"Nazi Literature in the Americas" presents itself as an encyclopedia of right-wing writers. The book is composed of short biographies of imaginary Pan-American authors. The literary Nazis—fascists and ultra-right sympathizers and zealots, most from South America, a few from North America—portrayed in that book are a gallery of self-deluded mediocrities, snobs, opportunists, narcissists, and criminals. About "Nazi Literature in the Americas", Bolaño told an interviewer:
Although the writers are invented, they are all carefully situated in real literary worlds: Bolaño's characters rebuff Allen Ginsberg’s advances in Greenwich Village, encounter Octavio Paz in Mexico City, and quarrel with José Lezama Lima in Cuba.
Forerunners to this type of fictional writer biographies can be seen in the short stories of Jorge Luis Borges, particularly "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote" and "An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain".
Contents.
Presents the Argentinian poetess Edelmira Thompson de Mendiluce, her son Juan Mendiluce Thompson, and her daughter Luz Mendiluce Thompson. Edelmira, among other ventures, attempts to create a room based on Edgar Allan Poe's essay "Philosophy of Furniture" and founds "The Fourth Reich in Argentina", a literary magazine and publishing house which publish works by several of the writers appearing later in the book. Juan is a novelist and politician while Luz is a talented but troubled poet who suffers failed marriages, struggles with alcoholism and overweight, and is eventually doomed by her love for a much younger woman.
This section differs in tone from the rest of the book, rather than being delivered as a dry encyclopedic entry it is narrated by a character, named Bolaño, who was a witness to some of the events. The story was later expanded into the novella "Distant Star", with the name of the protagonist changed to Alberto Ruiz-Tagle. this is explained in the introduction to the novel thus:
Critical reception.
Stacey D'Erasmo, in a review for "The New York Times", describes "Nazi Literature in the Americas" as:
“a wicked, invented encyclopedia of imaginary fascist writers and literary tastemakers, is Bolaño playing with sharp, twisting knives. As if he were Borges’s wisecracking, sardonic son, Bolaño has meticulously created a tightly woven network of far-right littérateurs and purveyors of belles lettres for whom Hitler was beauty, truth and great lost hope." 
Michael Dirdra, of "The Washington Post" found that the novel, "very much deserves reading: It is imaginative, full of a love for literature, and, unlikely as it may seem, exceptionally entertaining." John Brenkman of "The Village Voice" sees the book as both a satire and an elegy, stating, 
""Nazi Literature in the Americas" is first of all a prank, an act of genius wasting its time in parodic attacks on a hated sort of writer. But beyond that, it produces an unsettling mix of overt satire and covert elegy. The reductive force of summary after summary starts to have an effect that transcends the satire; the book begins to convey a sense of the vanity of human endeavor and the ease with which a lifetime's work might be flicked into oblivion by a witty remark."
Giles Harvey, writing for "The New Yorker", included the novel in his list of Bolaño's best work, explaining that:
"This mock reference book of imaginary right-wing litterateurs — including soccer-hooligans-cum poets and a sci-fi novelist who excitedly envisages Hitler’s Reich triumphing in the United States — is every bit as fun as it sounds. Like David Thomson’s "Biographical Dictionary of Film" or, indeed, Philip Rees’s non-fictional "Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right", "Nazi Literature" is not a book to read straight through, but rather to dip into whenever the mood (in this case a rather dark, antisocial mood) takes you."
In a dissenting opinion Alberto Manguel, writing for "The Guardian", finds the novel is,
"at first mildly amusing but quickly becomes a tedious pastiche of itself. Like a joke whose punchline is given in the title, the humour is undermined, and all that is left is a series of names, dates and titles that, since they don't come across as funny, become merely irritating [...] It is not enough to invent a character and lend it a name and a bibliography and a few circumstantial details; something must justify its existence on the page, which otherwise risks resembling an annotated phonebook."

Union Fire Company

Union Fire Company, sometimes called Benjamin Franklin's Bucket Brigade, was a volunteer fire department formed in Philadelphia in 1736 with the assistance of Benjamin Franklin. The first fire fighting organization in Philadelphia, though followed within the year by the Fellowship Fire Company. The fire company was formed on 7 December, 1736 after a series of publications in the "Pennsylvania Gazette" by Franklin and others pointing out the need for more effective handling of fires in Philadelphia and remained active until approximately 1820.
Organization.
In the 1884 book "History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884", John Thomas Scharf and Thompson Westcott described the organization of the company:
The Union Fire Company was an association for mutual assistance. Each member agreed to furnish, at his own expense, six leather buckets and two stout linen bags, each marked with his name and the name of the company, which he was to bring to every fire. The buckets were for carrying water to extinguish the flames, and the bags were to receive and hold property which was in danger, to save it from risk of theft. The members pledged themselves to repair to any place in danger upon an alarm of fire with their apparatus. Some were to superintend the use of the water, others were to stand at the doors of houses in danger, and to protect the property from theft. On an alarm of fire at night it was agreed that lights should be placed in the windows of houses of members near the fire "in order to prevent confusion, and to enable their friends to give them more speedy and effectual assistance.'
According to Scharf and Westcott, the company was limited to 30 members who met eight times a year and were fined if they were late to or missed a meeting. The company had no president, but a treasurer and a clerk, take in turns from the general membership, who not only managed communications with other members but also inspected the gear. Scharf and Westcott note that this structure was the basis for all fire companies in Philadelphia until the Revolutionary War. The early members of the Company included Isaac Paschal, Samuel Powell, William Rawle, and Samuel Syme.
Equipment.
With respect to the equipment, Scharf and Westcott note the following:
At this time engines and buckets were the only available apparatus, as pumps were few, and the supply of water scant. The engine of the Union Company, it is believed, was imported from England, as were also those of the other companies formed down to 1768.
<br><br>
The engine of the Union Company was probably kept in a house in Grindstone Alley, which runs north from Market Street to Church Alley, west of Second Street.
In 1752, the Union Fire Company went in with the Hand-in-Hand Fire Company to purchase a fire bell which was placed on Fourth Street where it could be heard throughout the city. By 1791, the Company was in possession of an fire hose, considerably shorter than the hose owned by the Fellowship Fire Company. In addition, in that year, according to Franklin autobiography editor John Bigelow, the Company possessed 250 buckets, 13 ladders, two hooks and "no bags."

History.
Kaifaqu was established in September, 1984 under the former name of Dalian Economic and technological Development Zone () or Dalian Development Zone (DDZ). The new name has been in place for several years several years, due to the much extended range of the territory including the Dalian Free Trade Zone () to the south and Dalian DD Port () to the east. The new name also reflects increased economic prosperity.

Hellingly Hospital

Hellingly Hospital, formerly the East Sussex County Asylum was a large psychiatric hospital close to the village of Hellingly, east of Hailsham, in the English county of East Sussex.
Design and construction.
The County Authority of East Sussex decided to build a new lunatic asylum at the turn of the twentieth century after problems of overcrowding at the Haywards Heath Asylum, formerly the Sussex County Asylum. To this end the County Council purchased the 400 acre Park Farm estate, a short distance from Hellingly village and railway station, from the earl of Chichester for £16,000. Construction began in 1898 and the new asylum was built to a compact arrow plan by George Thomas Hine, consultant architect to the Commissioners in Lunacy. The hospital opened on July 20th, 1903 at a total cost of £353,400.
The main complex comprised an administrative block, central stores, kitchens, a recreation hall and the assistant medical officer's residence. Like most large institutions of this age and type the sexes were separated into separate accommodation and work areas. To the west of the central block stood the male wards, workshops, boiler house, water tower and maintenance department. The female wards were located on the east side of the hospital along with the laundry, sewing room and a nurses' home. All of the buildings in the main complex were linked by an extensive network of corridors.
To the north of the main buildings were a chapel and four further villas including one for male working patients, two for female working patients and another for mentally defective children. Park House, a hospital annexe for acute cases was located to the southwest of the main asylum and a small isolation hospital for infectious diseases was placed in the woods to the far north-west of the grounds to reduce the risk of infection. The estate plan incorporated two driveways: one from the south-west lined with medical officers' residences and the acute hospital and another second from the south routed via the farm, male farm-workers' villa and married attendants' cottages.
Hospital railway.
The hospital had its own electric tramway, the Hellingly Hospital Railway. The line led from the Hellingly Station to the boilerhouse and was used principally for transporting coal for the heating boilers and electricity plant. The line closed to passenger traffic in 1930 and the track was lifted in 1959 at which time the hospital boilers were converted from coal to oil fuel.
Later developments and decline.
Post-war developments included the conversion of the Superintendent's residence to a nurse's home, the closure of the hospital farm, the construction of Tennyson house and the staff social club. During the mid-1980s, Hellingly was chosen as one of five mental hospital sites in the south east of England to accommodate a medium secure unit, known as Ashen Hill and located to the east of the main buildings and villas. Despite these developments, patient numbers were already declining and the entire main building was vacated and closed in 1994.
Abandonment and demolition.
After closure, most of the buildings fell into rapid decline, suffering from arson, vandalism and theft. By 2003 the site had become popular with urban explorers who came to document the vast abandoned complex. In mid-2010, work began to clear the site for new housing. Only a few of the original buildings now remain, although the Ashen Hill secure unit continued to operate on site until early 2012. Another low secure unit is on the site known as Southview which was opened in 2000. The new Medium secure unit, known as The Hellingly Centre opened in April 2012, with 45 beds split between 3 wards at a cost of £17.5 million. Plans are underway for more units alongside the new housing

Robert Williams (psychologist)

Robert Lee Williams II is a Professor Emeritus of Psychology and African and Afro-American Studies at the Washington University in St. Louis and a prominent figure in the history of African-American Psychology. He is well known as a stalwart critic of racial and cultural biases in IQ testing, for coining the word “Ebonics” in 1973, and for developing the Black Intelligence Test of Cultural Homogeneity. He has published more than sixty professional articles and several books. He was a founding member of the Association of Black Psychologists, and served as its second President.
Childhood and family.
Robert Lee Williams was born in Biscoe, Arkansas on February 20, 1930. His father, Robert L. Williams, worked as a millwright and died when his son was just five years old. Williams’ mother, Rosie L. Williams, worked in the homes of white families until her death in 1978. He has one sister, Dorothy Jean. He married Ava L. Kemp in 1948, at the age of 18, to whom he has remained married 65 years and had eight children, 17 grandchildren, and 13 great grandchildren. His eight college educated children include four psychologists, a nurse, a journalist, a teacher, and a leather craftswoman.
Education.
Robert L. Williams graduated from Dunbar High School in Little Rock at the age of sixteen before attending Dunbar Junior College for one year. Williams earned a BA degree (cum laude with Distinction in Field) from Philander Smith College in 1953. He earned a M.Ed. from Wayne State University in educational psychology in 1955 at a time when all graduate programs in the South remained segregated, and a Ph.D in 1961 from Washington University in St. Louis in clinical psychology.
Career.
Dr. Williams worked as a Staff Psychologist at Arkansas State Hospital, the first African-American psychologist to be hired at a State Mental Health facility in Arkansas. He later served as Chief Psychologist, at the Jefferson Barracks Veterans Affairs Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, Director of a Hospital Improvement Project in Spokane, Washington, and a consultant for the National Institute of Mental Health. In 1968 he was a founding member of the National Association of Black Psychologists, and served as its Second President. From 1970 to 1992 he served as Full Professor of Psychology and African and African-American Studies at Washington University in St. Louis. He founded the department of Black Studies at Washington University and served as its first Director, developing a curriculum that would serve as a model throughout the country.
Black Intelligence Test of Cultural Homogeneity (BITCH).
Dr. Williams created the Black Intelligence Test of Cultural Homogeneity by drawing from a glossary of African-American vernacular and personal experience. “Danger: Testing and De-humanizing Black Children” Though structured similarly to traditional IQ testing, European Americans scored consistently lower on the BITCH than African Americans. Dr. Williams did not conclude, as had white psychologists, that this proved the intellectual inferiority of European Americans.
Coining the term Ebonics.
Dr. Williams created the term Ebonics (a combination of “ebony” and “phonics”) to refer to African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) on January 26, 1973 at a conference called “The Cognitive and Language Development of Black Children”. In 1975 he edited a book entitled "", which explained the African roots of Ebonics and refuted the popular conception that Ebonics was simply slang or deficient English.
Black Personality Theory.
Dr. Williams formulated his Black Personality Theory, presented in his second book, "The Collective Mind: Toward an Afrocentric Theory of Black Personality". His theory argued that black personality cannot be understood using European philosophy and values. Instead the Black Personality Theory would draw on an African philosophy of collectiveness diametrically opposed to Western individualism.
Racial scripting.
Professor Williams argues that white children acquire racist predispositions at a young age through the process of “racial scripting”. In this work he identifies a number of myths and stereotypes that form these racial scripts, including the myth of Black Genetic Deficiency, the Deteriorating Black Family, Cultural Deprivation, Black Language Deficiency, Black Self-Hatred, Damaged Black Psyche, the Superior Sexual Stud, the Superior Black Athlete, and the Lazy Negro. He argues that these myths and attitudes form a racial 'script' or schema which the adult person draws upon to understand situations. Thus racial scripting received in childhood can shape the conceptions of reality of an adult.
Popular exposure.
Dr. Williams has appeared in the public eye on numerous occasions, appearing on television with Dan Rather, Phil Donahue, and Montel Williams. His work has been cited by many major newspapers, and served as a theme for an episode of "Good Times".

Moroccan Christmas

"Moroccan Christmas" is the eleventh episode of the fifth season of the television series "The Office", and the show's eighty-third episode overall. The episode aired in the United States on December 11, 2008 on NBC. 
It is the third Christmas-themed episode of "The Office" and the first in two years, as 2007's planned edition was abandoned due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike.
In this episode, Phyllis throws a Moroccan-themed Christmas party as head of the Party Planning Committee, infuriating former head Angela. The party takes a dark turn when Meredith gets drunk and accidentally catches her hair on fire. Meanwhile, Dwight takes advantage of the latest toy craze - a Princess Unicorn doll.
Plot.
Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) throws a Moroccan-themed Christmas party, her first Christmas party as head of the Party Planning Committee. Alcohol is served at the party, of which Meredith (Kate Flannery) takes full advantage—she gets so intoxicated that she accidentally sets her hair on fire while she is dancing around. Dwight (Rainn Wilson) puts out the fire with an extinguisher and the party comes to a halt. Michael (Steve Carell) then stages an intervention by gathering everyone in a circle to discuss how Meredith's alcoholism affects them. When Meredith continues to deny her alcoholism, the rest of the office find it best to go back to the party. Michael then talks with Meredith in his office before leaving the building. Meredith is told by Michael that they are going to a bar, but he actually takes her to a rehabilitation center. When Meredith sees this, she tries to escape, but Michael grabs her and drags her into the center. However, Michael learns that the staff will not check anyone in against their will, so he and Meredith leave and head back to the office.
Dwight has been performing research to determine what will be the most popular toy of the current Christmas season: a doll named "Princess Unicorn", which is (as the name implies) a princess with a unicorn horn on its head. Dwight has bought every doll he could find in the local toy stores and explains he is going to sell the dolls to desperate parents for an enormous profit. Jim (John Krasinski) is skeptical that people would pay a high price for a doll, but he watches numerous customers come in throughout the day to purchase a doll from Dwight, all paying his asking price of $200. Toby (Paul Lieberstein) wants to buy a doll for his daughter, Sasha, so he can be the hero this Christmas, which would irritate his ex-wife. When he goes to Dwight to purchase one, he finds that Darryl (Craig Robinson) has already purchased the last one. Toby begs Darryl to the verge of tears, and Darryl offers to sell it to him for twice the price. Toby tells him that he does not have the money with him, but Darryl allows him to pay him back later, and Toby becomes visibly happy. He is, however, slightly shocked when the doll he gets from Darryl is a black version of the doll, but he decides not to complain.
Throughout the day, Phyllis continues to order Angela (Angela Kinsey) to do various tasks for the party, such as preparing a plate of bread and hummus during Michael's intervention, or putting away her Nativity scene and removing the Christmas tree (as neither of those are in the theme of Moroccan Christmas). When Phyllis tells Angela to bring back the Christmas tree after Michael and Meredith leave, Angela refuses, telling Phyllis that she will no longer fulfill Phyllis' demands. Phyllis threatens to inform everyone of Angela's affair with Dwight, but Angela still refuses, as Phyllis would no longer be head of the Party Planning Committee if she did. As Phyllis despondently heads toward the door, she suddenly turns around and announces to the office that Angela is having an affair with Dwight, much to everyone's shock. Angela is visibly upset while Dwight is visibly amused. Pam (Jenna Fischer) claims that she knew it all along, which Jim initially doubts, but then decides to believe her in the spirit of Christmas. Andy (Ed Helms), however, was absent for Phyllis' announcement, having been in the annex teaching himself to play a sitar. At the end of the episode, he returns to the party to play "Deck the Halls" for Angela on the sitar, before she asks him to take her home. The rest of the office decide not to reveal Angela's secret to Andy.
Production.
"Moroccan Christmas" was written by Justin Spitzer and directed by Paul Feig. Kate Flannery said shooting this episode was "maybe the most fun I have ever had working in front of a camera". Although Flannery has done her own stunts in previous episodes, including when she was struck by a car in the fourth season premiere "Fun Run", a stuntwoman was used for the scenes in which her hair catches fire in "Moroccan Christmas".
Cultural references.
Shortly after Meredith's hair catches fire, Kevin calls her "fire girl". This is a reference to the second season episode "The Fire", in which then-temp Ryan Howard accidentally sets a fire in the office, earning himself the nickname "fire guy" from Kevin. When Meredith angrily declares she is fine during her intervention, Michael refers to two entertainers when he responds, "Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine?" While Michael is bar tending during the party, he makes Jim a drink containing orange juice and vodka. Though commonly known as a Screwdriver, Michael ignorantly refers to it as an "Orange-Vod-Juice-Ka" implying that he was the first person to concoct it.
Reception.
Phyllis's takeover of the Party Planning Committee and the subsequent fight with Angela ranked number 9 in "phillyBurbs.com"'s top ten moments from the fifth season of "The Office". However, "Moroccan Christmas" was voted the second lowest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite "OfficeTally"; the episode was rated 7.08 out of 10.
Brian Howard of "The Journal News" was mixed in his review of "Moroccan Christmas". He praised the cold open scene, Toby's reaction to the doll and Andy's reaction at the end of the episode. But Howard said he did not enjoy the Moroccan Christmas party theme, and felt scenes of Meredith's alcoholism and Michael dragging her to rehab were more awkward than funny. "Moroccan Christmas" received generally mixed reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with "The Star-Ledger", was highly complimentary toward "Moroccan Christmas", which he said featured "consistent hilarity mixed in with some of the sharpest emotion we've ever gotten from a non Jim & Pam story". Sepinwall called it a strong episode for the Dwight, Andy Meredith and Phyllis characters, and particularly complimented the acting of Phyllis Smith. "TV Guide" writer Shahzad Abbas called it an "excellent episode all around", referring to intervention scene and the fighting among Phyllis and Angela as "really intense stuff". Abbas said she looked forward to seeing the new developments unfold, and said Ed Helms had "never been better with his 'where's these people's Christmas spirit' reaction".
"New York" magazine writer Will Leitch criticized the episode, claiming the main story between Meredith and Michael seemed forced and did not work. Leitch particularly disliked the Phyllis subplot, claiming her negative behavior toward Angela was out of character and ineffective.

East German general election, 1990

Legislative elections were held in East Germany on 18 March 1990. It was the first—and as it turned out, only—free parliamentary election in the GDR, and the first truly free election held in that part of Germany since 1933. A total of 400 deputies were elected to the Volkskammer. The largest bloc was the opposition Alliance for Germany, led by the East German branch of the Christian Democratic Union and running on a platform of speedy reunification with the West. The runner-up was the East German branch of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which had only been refounded six months earlier. The former Socialist Unity Party of Germany participated under its new name, Party of Democratic Socialism and received the third largest number of seats. 
On 5 April 1990, the new Volkskammer elected the CDU's Sabine Bergmann-Pohl as its president; as the State Council was at the same time dissolved, she became East Germany's interim head of state. Lothar de Maizière (CDU) became prime minister, heading a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, the SDP, the FDP, the German Social Union (DSU) and one non-attached member.
On 20 September of the same year, the parliament voted to dissolve East Germany and to unify its territory with the Federal Republic of Germany, thus ending the state's 40-year existence. The unification treaty was approved on a 442–47 vote by the Bundestag and by a 299–80 margin in the Volkskammer, and took effect on 3 October.

Rob Bell (Virginia politician)

Robert B. "Rob" Bell III (born April 23, 1967) is an American politician. He has been a Republican member of the Virginia House of Delegates since 2002, representing the 58th district in the Virginia Piedmont, including Greene County and parts of Albemarle, Fluvanna and Rockingham Counties. In 2013, Bell ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for Attorney General of Virginia.
Game designer.
Rob Bell worked as a convention volunteer and part-time intern for Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) while attending classes at the University of Virginia, and began working for ICE full time as an editor in 1988. Bell expanded and unified the "Hero System" licensed by ICE from Hero Games. The fourth edition of the role-playing game "Champions" (1989) was largely the work of Bell; aside from writing the book, he had also coordinated a volunteer effort with dozens of gaming groups to give input and feedback on the "Hero System". Bell left ICE in 1990 and later got into politics.
Virginia House of Delegates.
Abortion.
In 2012, Bell voted in favor of a bill requiring all women to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound prior to having an abortion, except in cases of rape and incest, wherein police reports must be presented. While massive silent protests outside the Virginia state capitol initially resulted in the bill’s patron holding off on the vote on the bill, it was passed the next day. On March 1, 2012, Bell voted in favor of an amended version of the bill requiring women to undergo an transabdominal ultrasound prior to an abortion if written consent for a transvaginal ultrasound is not obtained, and no ultrasound at all if the physician deems it impossible to determine fetal age through the prescribed means.
Citizenship inquiries.
During the 2012 legislative session, Bell was the primary sponsor of a bill requiring police to inquire into the citizenship of anyone arrested, regardless of criminal charges. The bill was widely criticized by civil rights organizations and failed to pass.
Education.
In 2012 and 2013, Bell patroned the "Tebow Bill", named for Tim Tebow, which would allow homeschooled students meeting academic standards the opportunity to participate in public school sports teams and other extracurricular activities.
Public safety.
As of 2013, Bell serves as the Chairman of the Virginia State Crime Commission.
In 2006, Bell proposed legislation to bar violent sex offenders from school property, following public outrage over a convicted sex offender serving as a Santa Claus at an elementary school. In 2012, he proposed a bill expanding this ban to cover school buses and school-affiliated events.
In 2008, Bell proposed legislation to require school superintendents to screen job applicants for a history of child abuse convictions in Virginia and other states, as well as criminalize the misrepresentation of an applicant's offender status.
Attorney General.
On December 6, 2011, Bell announced that he was a candidate for the 2013 Republican nomination for Attorney General of Virginia. State Senator Mark Obenshain won the nomination over Bell by a 55%-45% margin at a statewide convention in Richmond on May 18, 2013.

Westfield Ferry

The Westfield Ferry is a cable ferry in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. The ferry crosses the Saint John River, linking Grand Bay–Westfield on the west bank to Hardings Point on the east bank.
The crossing is in length, takes 5 minutes, and free of tolls. Two ferries operate on the crossing, carrying up to 15 or 18 cars at a time respectively. The service operates with a single ferry 24 hours a day all year, with the second ferry brought into service at busy periods. It is operated by the New Brunswick Department of Transportation. 
On October 15, 1996, the Westfield Ferry suffered a cable failure whilst the vessel was in mid-river. In high winds and waves, the drifting ferry was carried down river for about two hours, until the ferry was eventually rescued by a tugboat. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada conducted an investigation, and determined that the cable failed due to wear and corrosion of the cable. Concerns were raised about the level of training for the crew, and the lack of provision of an anchor on the ferry.

Margaret of Bohemia, Queen of Hungary

Margaret of Bohemia (24 May 1335–1349, before October), also known as Margaret of Luxembourg, was the second child of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor by his first wife Blanche of Valois. She was a member of the House of Luxembourg and was Queen consort of Hungary by her marriage.
Margaret was the second child of her father's first marriage. She was betrothed at the age of two to Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy, the contract being signed on 7 March 1338. The contract was, however, broken and Amadeus married Margaret's cousin, Bonne of Bourbon.
At the age of seven, Margaret was married in 1342 to Louis I of Hungary.
The marriage lasted seven years and no children were born of the union, probably because of Margaret's young age. She died in 1349 while still a minor, aged around fourteen, and was probably buried in Székesfehérvár Basilica. She had outlived her mother, Blanche, by only one year. Her husband remarried four years later to Elizabeth of Bosnia.

World War Foreign Debts Commission Act

The United States federal World War Foreign Debts Commission Act of February 9, 1922 authorized the creation of a commission, working under Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, to negotiate repayment agreements with Great Britain and France in the aftermath of World War I. 
The Commission placed the Allied debt principal to the United States at $11 billion; payments were to be made in graduated 62 annual installments; however, the accrued interest on these payments over a period of 62 years would have increased the debt to approximately $22 billion, although the U.S. did agree to lowered interest rates. Great Britain’s debt was reduced 19.7% to $4.6 billion with the interest rate reduced from 5% to 3% for the first ten years of payment to be raised to 3½% thereafter. France’s debt was reduced by 52.8% to $4 billion, without any interest for the first five years of payment. It was then to be increased gradually to 3½%.

Bundesautobahn 100

The A 100 encloses the city centre of the German capital Berlin, running from the Wedding district of the Berlin-Mitte borough in a southwestern bow through Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf and Tempelhof-Schöneberg to Neukölln. It is connected with the Bundesautobahn 111 (A 111) at the Charlottenburg interchange, with the A 115 (the former AVUS) at the Funkturm junction, and finally reaches the A 113 at its southeastern terminus in Neukölln, all linking it with the outer "Berliner Ring" A 10. The route in most parts runs parallel to tracks of the inner circle line ("Ringbahn") of the Berlin S-Bahn. 
The first section at western Kurfürstendamm was opened in 1958. According to the concept of a "car-friendly" city, the A 100 then indeed was intended to become a ring road, but by now a completion of the ring as an autobahn is no longer proposed. It is nonetheless still often called "Stadtring" ("city ring"). The section between the Funkturm and Kurfürstendamm interchanges is busiest autobahn in Germany with an average of 191400 vehicles per day. Recently a planned southeastern extension to Sonnenallee and Treptower Park has been the cause for various protests.

Abdullah bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa

Abdullah bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa (born 30 June 1975) is the second son of the present King of Bahrain, Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifah and his first wife, Sabika bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa.
Like all members of the royal family, Abdullah sits as a senior member of the civil judiciary.
Furthermore Abdullah has a personal love of music, and has fitted his palace in the Kingdom with a recording studio. He also has homes in Kensington, London and has a cottage in Devon, England. Musically he enjoys Led Zeppelin and Bob Marley, owns a vintage Gibson electric guitar, and rides a Harley Davidson.
Friendship with Michael Jackson.
A long time friend of American pop legend Michael Jackson, Abdullah loaned his friend £2.2million to pay legal fees after the singer was tried for child molestation in California in 2005. After the successful defence and dismissal of all charges, Abdullah invited Jackson, his children and personal staff to stay in Bahrain, which Jackson took up on 30 June 2005. 
As part of a plan to revive Jackson's career with the release of a new album, after Hurricane Katrina Sheikh Abdullah suggested that Jackson record a song Abdullah had written as a charity single at a recording studio in London, ""I Have This Dream."" Jackson undertook the recording session in London, but the single was never released through the co-owned record label "2 Seas Group." Jackson left the Kingdom in May 2006 for Ireland.
In November 2008, after trying to recover £4.7 million costs from Jackson which the singer said were gifts, Abdullah sued the singer through the mutually agreed High Court in London. Abdullah claims that despite having paid the $2.2m (£1.5m) cost for Jackson to record a song intended to benefit the victims of Hurricane Katrina, the singer failed to attend the studio for the final recording and the song was never released. Bankim Thanki QC, representing Abdullah, told the High Court that the day after Jackson's criminal trial ended in California, that he recorded one of the songs which Abdullah wanted released as a charity single to help victims of the Indian ocean tsunami, and that Sheikh Abdullah felt "a strong sense of personal betrayal" after forming "a close personal relationship" with the singer.
Marriage and children.
Sheikh Abdullah is married to Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Khalifa. She was member of the Supreme Council for Women between 2001 and 2004, is Permanent Member of the Board since 2004, Executive Director of Jazz Bahrain since 2005, Member of Suzanne Mubarak Women’s International Peace Movement, and Member of Young Arab Leaders of Bahrain. Together they have five children, three sons and two daughters:

General Exchange Act of 1922

The General Exchange Act of 1922 (March 20, 1922; 42 Stat. 465, as amended; 74 Stat. 205; 
16 U.S.C. 485, 486, 7 U.S.C. 2201) permitted the United States Secretary of the Interior to accept or acquire lands outside of the boundaries of current national parks deemed to be of national-forest purposes interest. Federal land could also be exchanged for privately owned land within the boundaries of United States National Forest. The law permits acquisition of lands by exchange, encumbered by reservations of timber, or minerals or easements that would not interfere with use of the lands for National Forest purposes. 
This was a new type of act, the purpose of which was to relieve Congress of the burden of considering new legislation every time an exchange authority was proposed for a federal tract. Against this burden was balanced the difficulty of making certain, without Congressional consideration of each exchange, that the terms of the exchange were responsive to local needs.
The act is amended by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976 (90 Stat. 2743; 43 U.S.C. 1715, 1716), which authorizes the Secretary to accept title to any non-Federal land or interest therein.

Woooo!

"Woooo!" is the eighth episode in the fourth season of the television series "How I Met Your Mother" and 72nd overall. It originally aired on November 17, 2008.
Plot.
Still unemployed, Robin finds some solace in hanging out with Lily, but she is upset that Marshall is always there. Lily suggests that Robin come with her to Jillian's birthday party, a second grade teacher at Lily's school.
Barney tells Ted that the Goliath National Bank is renovating their main building, and that he is trying to convince his boss to give Ted's architecture firm a chance to pitch a design. Ted faces competition from a Swedish architecture collective called Sven, a company he already hates. Excited at the prospect of the three of them working together, Marshall says they should include Ted in the "conference call", an excuse he and Barney use to go up to the roof and drink beer. Future Ted, meanwhile, explains that this was his big shot at fulfilling his dream of adding a building to the New York skyline.
Robin and Lily arrive at a western style bar for Jillian's party, with Lily hoping that Jillian did not realize what kind of place it was. They soon find out that Jillian is actually a 'Woo girl', a single girl who loves to go out partying and constantly shouts "woooooo!".
Ted presents his design to Barney which he thought was amazing and is exactly how he imagines Princess Leia naked. When Marshall arrives and tells them that Lily is out with a group of "woo girls", Barney springs into action, rushes to the bar and tells Lily and Robin that the world needs such girls, then sets out to try and pick them up.
Ted presents his ideas to the board of Goliath National Bank (GNB), and comes away feeling optimistic about his chances. Later that night, Barney tells him they decided to go with Sven's design. Ted is particularly upset after the bad couple of months he just had, so he, Barney and Marshall decide to go urinate on the current Goliath building. Meanwhile, Robin starts hanging out with the woo girls, so she can have fun with other unmarried women.
At Goliath National Bank, Marshall tells Bilson that even though they did not pick him, Ted is still a great architect. When Bilson replies that he voted for Ted, Marshall grabs Barney for a conference call to confront him. Barney explains that Ted's pitch was good, but he was swayed by Sven, who offered a building shaped like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and promised to give Barney a button to make it breathe fire, as well as putting in a strip club. Marshall is so upset he refuses to have another conference call with Barney, and leaves him locked outside on the roof alone.
Lily tries to hang out with Robin by becoming a woo girl, but cannot get it right. Robin explains that Lily cannot be a woo girl because she is happy. Robin translates each of the girl's woos, and shows that each of them is miserable, as is Ted after losing his contract. She also tells Lily that at the moment, she is like them, being unemployed and single. Lily promises to make more time for Robin, and to try to get away from Marshall now and then.
Barney invites the Svens to a conference call, but finds they do not understand what he's doing. Feeling bad about betraying his friend, Barney has the company fire Sven and hire Ted. At the bar, Barney is about to explain that it was his fault Ted did not get the job in the first place when Marshall stops him, blaming Bilson. Marshall soon caves in and tells Ted the truth, so Ted ties Barney to a mechanical bull which was set to the maximum speed (after finding out that Barney has an inner ear problem) and goes home. Barney is freed three hours later, but is so dizzy he misses out on a threesome with Jillian and her "woo girl" friend (who intend to find "that guy Ted").

Force de Raid

The Force de Raid (Raiding Force) was a French naval squadron formed at Brest during naval mobilization for World War II. The squadron commanded by Vice Amiral Marcel Gensoul consisted of the most modern French capital ships "Dunkerque" and "Strasbourg", screened by the three newest French cruisers, the eight largest and most modern "contre-torpilleurs", and the only French aircraft carrier. The Force effectively ceased to exist as a separate unit after the British attack on Mers-el-Kébir.
Strategic significance.
Battleships had been internationally perceived as the strategic arms race focus since the Washington Naval Conference of 1921. Countries unable to match the numbers of battleships maintained by the United States and the United Kingdom had built faster battleships so they might have the option of evading stronger fleets. Italy modernized "Conte di Cavour" and "Giulio Cesare" in 1937 with new engines increasing their speed to 28 knots. Germany completed the 31-knot battleships "Gneisenau" in 1938 and "Scharnhorst" in January 1939. For the first ten months of World War II, the "Dunkerque"-class battleships of "Force de Raid" were the only modern Allied battleships available to counter the "Scharnhorst"-class battleships. The old Royal Navy battle cruisers , , and had similar speed, but their horizontal deck armor offered inadequate protection against aerial bombs and the plunging trajectory of long-range gunfire.
The Italian battleships "Vittorio Veneto" and "Littorio" were completed in April and May of 1940. "Caio Duilio" was modernized to a speed of 27 knots in July, and "Andrea Doria" completed similar modernization in October. The German battleship "Bismarck" was completed in August. Britain's first modern battleship would not be completed until December 1940, and a British Defense Council subcommittee had concluded as recently as 1936 there was no justification for assuming aircraft could destroy battleships. This conclusion would be disproved by the battle of Taranto in November, but Winston Churchill remained focused on battleships as late as August 1941.
History.
The "Force de Raid" sortied from Brest immediately following declaration of war and temporarily patrolled off Casablanca to prevent a "Kriegsmarine" raid on Moroccan ports. The Allies organized eight naval hunting groups on 5 October 1939 when the pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" began sinking merchant ships in the South Atlantic. "Dunkerque", "Béarn", "Montcalm", "Georges Leygues", "Gloire", "L'Audacieux", "Le Fantasque", "Le Malin", "Le Terrible", "Le Triomphant", "L'Indomptable", "Mogador", and "Volta" of "Force de Raid" patrolled the North Atlantic from Brest as Force L, while "Strasbourg" was detached to the West Indies to form Force N with and . "Bearn" proved too slow to accompany the modern ships of "Force de Raid" and was soon detached for service as an aircraft transport bringing newly manufactured American warplanes to France. The remainder of Force L covered convoy KJ4 from Kingston, Jamaica to the British Isles to prevent attacks by the pocket battleship "Deutschland". "Strasbourg" left Dakar on 21 November and was escorted back to Brest on 27 November by "Le Triomphant", "L'Indomptable" and "Le Malin". "Strasbourg" sailed south again with HMS "Neptune" as Force Y during the Battle of the River Plate.
"Force de Raid" shifted its base of operations from Brest to Mers El Kébir on 27 April 1940 in anticipation of Italy joining the Axis. "Force de Raid" was unsuccessfully attacked by "Dandolo" on 13 June after a sortie from Mers El Kébir in response to a false report of a "Kriegsmarine" squadron preparing to enter the Strait of Gibraltar.
Although the "Force de Raid" was berthed in colonial Africa outside Axis-occupied territory following the Second Armistice at Compiègne, the wartime British Government of Winston Churchill was greatly alarmed by the possibility that these modern capital ships might be acquired by the Axis powers, with or without French consent. When Vice Amiral Gensoul refused British demands to violate armistice conditions, the Royal Navy shelled Mers El Kébir harbor. The surviving "Force de Raid" battleships were repaired and transferred to Toulon.

The nuchal organ is a ciliated pit or groove present at the posterior end of the prostomium of annelid worms, some cephalopods, and other invertebrates.
Annelids only possess one nuchal organ, although the nature of the grooving may make it appear to be a pair of organs.
It may be involved in light detection, and may have a role on food detection and mating.

Attorney General for Northern Ireland

The Attorney General for Northern Ireland is the chief legal adviser to the Northern Ireland Executive for both civil and criminal matters that fall within the devolved powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly.
The original post was formed in 1921 with the establishment of the Parliament of Northern Ireland and was always held by an Ulster Unionist Party MP. A Deputy Attorney General briefly held office in 1946, when the post was held by Edmond Warnock MP (21 June - 11 September).
The Attorney General for England and Wales performed the role of Attorney General for Northern Ireland after the prorogation of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1972. These office-holders were always United Kingdom Government Ministers.
Justice powers were again devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 12 April 2010, at which point the Attorney General for England and Wales ceased to hold office as Attorney General of Northern Ireland. She instead became Advocate General for Northern Ireland and a vacancy occurred. The current office-holder, John Larkin QC, is politically independent and took office on 24 May 2010, when he was appointed by First Minister Peter Robinson and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness.
The role and powers of the Attorney General for Northern Ireland are provided in the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. He or she is appointed for a term of not more than five years jointly by the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland.

97th Flying Training Squadron

The 97th Flying Training Squadron (97 FTS) is part of the 340th Flying Training Group and is the Reserve associate to the 80th Flying Training Wing based at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas.
The 97th flew combat in the European Theater of Operations and the Mediterranean Theater of Operations between 25 December 1942 and 3 May 1945. 
It flew fighter escort and air defense from, 1947–1949 and air defense from, 1951-1957.
The squadron was redesignated as the 97th Flying Training Squadron and trained USAF pilots to fly supersonic jet aircraft from 1973 to 1993. Since 1998 it has trained Air Force Reserve instructor pilots.
Mission.
The squadron operates Beechcraft T-6A Texan II and Northrop T-38 Talon aircraft conducting flight training for Air Force Reserve instructor pilots.
History.
World War II.
The squadron was first activated in early 1942 at Harding Field, Louisiana as the 97th Pursuit Squadron, one of the original three squadrons of the 82d Pursuit Group. It soon moved to California where it equipped with Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and began training with Fourth Air Force as the 97th Fighter Squadron. It left California in the fall and sailed for Northern Ireland, where it received additional combat training under Eighth Air Force. A month after the initial Operation Torch landings in North Africa the squadron deployed to Algeria, where it entered combat as an element of Twelfth Air Force.
In North Africa, the squadron flew antisubmarine patrols, bomber escort missions and attacked enemy shipping and airfields, moving its base east through Algeria and Tunisia. As the North African campaign drew to a close, the unit began attacking targets in Italy, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions on 25 April 1943 during an attack on enemy airfields in Foggia.
In September, the squadron participated in Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, during which it was awarded a second Distinguished Unit Citation for a bomber escort mission against marshalling yards near Naples. The squadron moved to Italy, where it became part of Fifteenth Air Force as part of the buildup to providee fighter cover for Fifteenth's heavy bombers. On 10 June 1944 the squadron earned a third Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions during an attack on oil refineries in Ploesti, Rumania.
Following the surrender of Germany, the squadron remained in Italy until September 1945, when it was inactivated In the course of the war the squadron was credited with the destruction of 146 enemy aircraft.
Cold War.
In 1947 the squadron was again activated at Grenier Field, New Hampshire, where it was equipped with North American P-51 Mustangs as a Strategic Air Command fighter escort unit. Between April and June 1948 the squadron deployed to Ladd Air Force Base, Alaska, where it practiced rendezvousing with and escorting bombers, intercepting simulated enemy bombers and aerial gunnery. In August 1949 it was transferred to Continental Air Command and its primary role became air defense, but this mission change was brief, for the squadron was inacivated in October.
In late 1950, the squadron, now designated the 97th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, was activated under Air Defense Command (ADC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio and soon began to equip with North American F-86 Sabres. Although it was assigned to Eastern Air Defense Force, in the first year it was active, it was attached to both the 56th and 142d Fighter-Interceptor Wings. This was due to ADC's difficulty under the existing wing base organizational structure in deploying fighter squadrons to best advantage. As a result, in February 1952 ADC reorganized its fighter forces on a regional basis, and the squadron was reassigned to the 4706th Defense Wing.
In August 1955, ADC implemented Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars. Project Arrow was also designed to reunite fighter squadrons with their traditional headquarters. As a result, the 97th moved on paper to New Castle County Airport, Delaware, where it assumed the mission, personnel, and HVAR Rocket armed Lockheed F-94 Starfire aircraft of the 332d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which moved on paper to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey. Meanwhile, the 97th's personnel and equipment at Wright-Patterson were assigned to the 56th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. The squadron remained at New Castle until it was inactivated in 1958.
Flying Training.
In 1972 Air Training Command replaced its Major Command (MAJCON) controlled flying training units with USAF controlled units (AFCON) units. As part of this program the squadron was redesignated the 97th Flying Training Squadron and activated at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona when its parent 82d Flying Training Wing replaced the 3525th Pilot Training Wing. At Williams the unit trained USAF pilots to fly Northrop T-38 Talon supersonic jet aircraft in the advanced phase of the Undergraduate Pilot Training program. The squadron was inactivated in 1993 when Williams closed in the second round of the Base Realignment and Closure program.
In 1998, the 97th Flying Training Squadron was activated in the Air Force Reserve at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas as an associate of the 80th Flying Training Wing. The 80th wing conducts the European-North Atlantic Treaty Organization Joint Jet Pilot Training Program. The squadron also uses the AT-38 in the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals, an advanced pilot course that teaches basic fighter maneuvers. As the reserve associate unit for these programs the squadron trains Air Force Reserve instructor pilots.

Elisabeth of Bohemia (1358–1373)

Elisabeth of Bohemia (1358–1373) was the daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and Anne of Schweidnitz. She was named after her paternal grandmother Elisabeth of Bohemia (1292–1330).
She had a brother Wenceslaus, King of the Romans and one half sister Katharine of Bohemia whose mother was Blanche of Valois who was Charles IV's previous wife. Elisabeth had another half sister who was the daughter of Blanche, Margaret of Bohemia but she died in 1349 so Elisabeth never knew her.
After the death of her mother, Charles remarried for the last time to Elizabeth of Pomerania. Elisabeth gained six half-siblings from the marriage: Anna, Queen of England, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, Margaret "the younger" of Bohemia, John of Görlitz, Charles and Henry.
Elisabeth married when she was only eight in 1366 to Albert III, Duke of Austria. Elisabeth and Albert had no children and she died aged only fifteen in 1373; she was buried with Albert's parents in Gaming Charterhouse in Lower Austria.
Her husband remarried to Beatrix of Nuremberg and they were parents of Albert IV, Duke of Austria.

Frederick Esling

Frederick Karl Esling (20 July 1860 Creswick, Victoria, Australia-31 July 1955 Box Hill, Victoria, Australia) was an Australian railway engineer and chess master.
Railway career.
Esling was engineer-in-charge in the Way and Works branch of the Victorian Railways department, located at Flinders street. Among the many important works that Mr. Esling carried out were the building of the Flinders Street Viaduct, the replacement of the spans on the railway bridge over the Maribyrnong River, refurbishment of the Moorabool Viaduct, and the complicated lay-out of the tracks at the Flinders street station and yards. The new Maribyrnong Bridge which was built inside the old bridge without any interruption of the traffic was a fine piece of work that excited much interest in engineering circles. Esling resigned from his railway position in 1917 because he did not consider that in the matter of promotion he had been fairly treated.
Esling presided over the topping out ceremony on the Flinders Street Station clock tower in 1909 when he laid the last brick and was presented with the ceremonial trowel. He published a number of technical papers, including one based on his work on the Flinders Street viaduct which identified a puzzling problem related to the horizontal forces due to braking, in combination with side forces from wind-pressure.
Chess Master.
At the age of 18, Esling won an offhand game against Adolf Anderssen. He won the first Australian Chess Championship by defeating George H. D. Gossip in a match in 1886. Gossip, having emigrated from England to Melbourne in 1885, issued a challenge the following year to any player in the Australian colonies to play him in a match for 20 pounds a side and the title of Australian champion. Esling, also a leading Melbourne player, accepted the challenge and won the first game, after which illness forced Gossip to forfeit the match. Esling finished second in the Second Australian Championship, a tournament held at Adelaide 1887, with 7 out of 9 points, behind Henry Charlick (7.5) but ahead of Gossip (6.5).
In 1895, Esling challenged Alfred Edward Noble Wallace of Sydney, the reigning Australian champion, to a match for the title. It was played in Melbourne between 8 June and 11 July, and aroused great interest. Wallace narrowly won, winning seven games and losing five, with four draws. In a letter published in "The Sydney Mail", he graciously wrote that "after the close fight we have had, I cannot as much as I would like to - think myself a better player than my late opponent, F.K. Esling, champion of Victoria".

United States war crimes

U.S. armed forces have committed war crimes in various wars in which they've been engaged throughout history. Most — but not all — contemporary war crimes are defined by the International Criminal Court (ICC), the Geneva Conventions, and the associated laws of war under international law. War crimes can be prosecuted through the War Crimes Act of 1996 in the United States, but the U.S. government does not accept the jurisdiction of the ICC over its military forces. United States violations of the laws of war falling under the rubric of "jus in bello" are discussed in the present article, while U.S. violations of "jus ad bellum", such as crimes against peace or wars of aggression under the Nuremberg Principles, are discussed elsewhere.
Philippine–American War.
The Committee on the Philippines was a standing committee of the United States Senate from 1899 to 1921. The committee was established to oversee administration of the Philippines, which Spain had ceded to the United States as part of the settlement of the Spanish-American War. The committee was established by Senate resolution on 15 December 1899, even though the treaty of 10 December 1899 had not yet been ratified. In 1921, the Committee was terminated and jurisdiction over legislative matters concerning the Philippines was transferred to the newly created Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions. War crimes committed by the United States Army include the March across Samar and the wanton destruction of a democratically elected government. 
World War II.
On January 26, 1943, the crew of the submarine USS Wahoo fired on survivors of the Japanese transport "Buyo Maru". The survivors were later determined to have included Allied POWs of the Indian 2nd Battalion, 16th Punjab Regiment, plus escorting forces from the 26th Field Ordnance Depot. Of 1,126 men aboard "Buyo Maru", 195 Indians and 87 Japanese died in all, including those killed in the initial sinking.
During and after the Battle of the Bismarck Sea (March 3–5, 1943), U.S. PT boats and aircraft strafed the thousands of adrift survivors of 8 sunken Japanese troop transports.
The "Canicattì massacre" involved the killing of Italian civilians by Lieutenant Colonel Herbert McCaffrey. A confidential inquiry was made, but McCaffrey was never charged with an offense relating to the massacre. He died in 1954. This fact remained virtually unknown in the U.S. until 2005, when Joseph S. Salemi of New York University, whose father witnessed it, reported it.
In the "Biscari massacre", which consisted of two instances of mass murder, U.S. troops of the 45th Infantry Division killed roughly 75 unarmed prisoners of war, most of whom were Italian.
According to an article in "Der Spiegel" by Klaus Wiegrefe, many personal memoirs of Allied soldiers have been willfully ignored by historians until now because they were at odds with the "Greatest Generation" mythology surrounding World War II. However, this has recently started to change, with books such as "The Day of Battle", by Rick Atkinson, where he describes Allied war crimes in Italy, and "D-Day: The Battle for Normandy," by Antony Beevor. Beevor's latest work is currently discussed by scholars, and should some of them be proven right, it suggests that Allied war crimes in Normandy were much more extensive "than was previously realized".
Historian Peter Lieb has found that many U.S. and Canadian units were ordered to not take enemy prisoners during the D-Day landings in Normandy. If this view is correct, it may explain the fate of 64 German prisoners (out of the 130 captured) who did not make it to the POW collecting point on Omaha Beach on the day of landings.
Near the French village of Audouville-la-Hubert, 30 German Wehrmacht prisoners were massacred by U.S. paratroopers.
In the aftermath of the 1944 Malmedy massacre, in which 80 unarmed U.S. military personnel were murdered by their German captors, a written order from Headquarters of the 328th U.S. Army Infantry Regiment, dated 21 December 1944, stated: "No SS troops or paratroopers will be taken prisoner but they will be shot on sight." Major-General Raymond Hufft (U.S. Army) gave instructions to his troops not to take prisoners when they crossed the Rhine in 1945. "After the war, when he reflected on the war crimes he authorized, he admitted, 'if the Germans had won, I would have been on trial at Nuremberg instead of them.'" Stephen Ambrose related: "I've interviewed well over 1000 combat veterans. Only one of them said he shot a prisoner... Perhaps as many as one-third of the veterans...however, related incidents in which they saw other GIs shooting unarmed German prisoners who had their hands up."
"Operation Teardrop" involved eight surviving captured crewmen from the sunken German submarine "U-546" being tortured by U.S. military personnel. Historian Philip K. Lundeberg has written that the beating and torture of "U-546's" survivors was a singular atrocity motivated by the interrogators' need to quickly get information on what the U.S. believed were potential missile attacks on the continental U.S. by German submarines.
[[File:Dachau execution coalyard 1945-04-29.jpg|thumb|SS concentration camp guards being executed at Dachau concentration camp during its day of liberation
(U.S. Army soldier photograph/National Archives)]]
The "Dachau massacre" involved the killing of German prisoners of war and surrendering SS soldiers at the Dachau concentration camp.
American soldiers during the Pacific War sometimes deliberately killed Japanese soldiers who had surrendered, according to Richard Aldrich (Professor of History at Nottingham University). Aldrich published a study of diaries kept by United States and Australian soldiers, wherein it was stated that they sometimes massacred prisoners of war. According to John Dower, in "many instances ... Japanese who did become prisoners were killed on the spot or "en route" to prison compounds." According to Professor Aldrich, it was common practice for U.S. troops not to take prisoners. His analysis is supported by British historian Niall Ferguson, who also says that, in 1943, "a secret [U.S.] intelligence report noted that only the promise of ice cream and three days leave would ... induce American troops not to kill surrendering Japanese."
Ferguson states such practices played a role in the ratio of Japanese prisoners to dead being 1:100 in late 1944. That same year, efforts were taken by Allied high commanders to suppress "take no prisoners" attitudes among their own personnel (as these were affecting intelligence gathering), and to encourage Japanese soldiers to surrender. Ferguson adds that measures by Allied commanders to improve the ratio of Japanese prisoners to Japanese dead resulted in it reaching 1:7, by mid-1945. Nevertheless, "taking no prisoners" was still "standard practice" among U.S. troops at the Battle of Okinawa, in April–June 1945.
Ulrich Straus, a U.S. Japanologist, suggests that troops on the front line intensely hated Japanese military personnel and were "not easily persuaded" to take or protect prisoners, as they believed (not entirely incorrectly) that Allied personnel who surrendered got "no mercy" from the Japanese. Allied soldiers believed that Japanese soldiers were inclined to feign surrender in order to make surprise attacks. Therefore, according to Straus, "Senior officers opposed the taking of prisoners on the grounds that it needlessly exposed American troops to risks ..." When prisoners nevertheless were taken at Gualdacanal, Army interrogator Captain Burden noted that many times POWs were shot during transport because "it was too much bother to take in".
Ferguson suggests that "it was not only the fear of disciplinary action or of dishonor that deterred German and Japanese soldiers from surrendering. More important for most soldiers was the perception that prisoners would be killed by the enemy anyway, and so one might as well fight on."
U.S. historian James J. Weingartner attributes the very low number of Japanese in U.S. prisoner of war compounds to two important factors, namely (1) a Japanese reluctance to surrender, and (2) a widespread American "conviction that the Japanese were 'animals' or 'subhuman' and unworthy of the normal treatment accorded to prisoners of war. The latter reason is supported by Ferguson, who says that "Allied troops often saw the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians — as Untermenschen" (i.e. "subhuman").
Rape.
It has been claimed that some U.S. soldiers raped Okinawan women during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945.
Based on several years of research, Okinawan historian Oshiro Masayasu (former director of the Okinawa Prefectural Historical Archives) writes:
However, many other authors have noted that Japanese civilians "were often surprised at the comparatively humane treatment they received from the American enemy." According to "Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power" by Mark Selden, the Americans "did not pursue a policy of torture, rape, and murder of civilians as Japanese military officials had warned."
There were also 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of Kanagawa prefecture after the Japanese surrender.
Secret wartime files made public only in 2006 reveal that American GIs committed 400 sexual offences in Europe, including 126 rapes in England, between 1942 and 1945. A study by Robert J. Lilly estimates that a total of 14,000 civilian women in England, France and Germany were raped by American GIs during World War II. It is estimated that there were around 3,500 rapes by American servicemen in France between June 1944 and the end of the war and one historian has claimed that sexual violence against women in liberated France was common.
Korean War.
No Gun Ri Massacre.
The No Gun Ri Massacre refers to an incident of mass killing of undetermined numbers of South Korean refugees conducted by U.S. Army forces of the 7th Cavalry Regiment (and in a U.S. air attack) between 26 July and 29 July 1950 at a railroad bridge near the village of No Gun Ri, 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Seoul. In 2005, the South Korean government certified the names of 163 dead or missing (mostly women, children and old men) and 55 wounded. It said many other victims' names were not reported. Over the years survivors' estimates of the dead have ranged from 300 to 500. This episode early in the Korean War gained widespread attention when the Associated Press (AP) published a series of articles in 1999 that subsequently won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting.
Vietnam War.
The Vietnam War Crimes Working Group Files is a collection of (formerly secret) documents compiled by Pentagon investigators in the early 1970s, confirming that atrocities by U.S. forces during the Vietnam War were more extensive than had been officially acknowledged. The documents are housed by the United States National Archives and Records Administration, and detail 320 alleged incidents that were substantiated by United States Army investigators (not including the 1968 My Lai Massacre). (See also Winter Soldier Investigation).
My Lai Massacre.
The My Lai Massacre was the mass murder of 347 to 504 unarmed citizens in South Vietnam, almost entirely civilians, most of them women and children, conducted by U.S. Army forces on 16 March 1968. Some of the victims were raped, beaten, tortured, or maimed, and some of the bodies were found mutilated. The massacre took place in the hamlets of Mỹ Lai and My Khe of Sơn Mỹ village during the Vietnam War. Of the 26 U.S. soldiers initially charged with criminal offenses or war crimes for actions at My Lai, only William Calley was convicted. Calley only served 3 years & a half in 'House Arrest' instead.
The incident prompted widespread outrage around the world, and reduced U.S. domestic support for the Vietnam War. Three American Servicemen (Hugh Thompson, Jr., Glenn Andreotta, and Lawrence Colburn), who made an effort to halt the massacre and protect the wounded, were sharply criticized by U.S. Congressmen, and received hate mail, death threats, and mutilated animals on their doorsteps. Thirty years after the event their efforts were honored.
"War on Terror".
As a reaction to the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. Government adopted several controversial measures (e.g., applying "unlawful combatant" status to prisoners, conducting extraordinary renditions, and enhanced interrogation methods).
Command responsibility.
Human Rights Watch had claimed in 2005 that the principle of "command responsibility" could make high-ranking officials within the Bush administration guilty of war crimes allegedly committed during the War on Terror, either with their knowledge or by persons under their control.
A presidential memorandum of September 7, 2002 authorized U.S. interrogators of prisoners captured in Afghanistan to deny the prisoners basic protections required by the Geneva Conventions, and thus according to Jordan J. Paust, professor of law and formerly a member of the faculty of the Judge Advocate General's School, "necessarily authorized and ordered violations of the Geneva Conventions, which are war crimes." Based on the president's memorandum, U.S. personnel carried out cruel and inhumane treatment on the prisoners, which necessarily means that the president's memorandum was a plan to violate the Geneva Convention, and such a plan constitutes a war crime under the Geneva Conventions, according to Professor Paust.
Alberto Gonzales and others argued that detainees should be considered "unlawful combatants" and as such not be protected by the Geneva Conventions in multiple memoranda regarding these perceived legal gray areas.
Gonzales' statement that denying coverage under the Geneva Conventions "substantially reduces the threat of domestic criminal prosecution under the War Crimes Act" suggests, to some authors, an awareness by those involved in crafting policies in this area that U.S. officials are involved in acts that could be seen to be war crimes. The U.S. Supreme Court challenged the premise on which this argument is based in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, in which it ruled that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applies to detainees in Guantanamo Bay and that the military tribunals used to try these suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law.
On April 14, 2006, Human Rights Watch said that Secretary Donald Rumsfeld could be criminally liable for his alleged involvement in the abuse of Mohammad al-Qahtani. On November 14, 2006, invoking universal jurisdiction, legal proceedings were started in Germany – for their alleged involvement of prisoner abuse – against Donald Rumsfeld, Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo, George Tenet and others.
The Military Commissions Act of 2006 is seen by some as an amnesty law for crimes committed in the War on Terror by retroactively rewriting the War Crimes Act and by abolishing "habeas corpus", effectively making it impossible for detainees to challenge crimes committed against them.
Luis Moreno-Ocampo has told the Sunday Telegraph he is willing to start an inquiry by the International Criminal Court (ICC), and possibly a trial, for war crimes committed in Iraq involving British Prime Minister Tony Blair and American President George W. Bush. Though under the Rome Statute, the ICC has no jurisdiction over Bush, since the U.S. is not a State Party to the relevant treaty—unless Bush were accused of crimes inside a State Party, or the UN Security Council (where the U.S. has a veto) requested an investigation. However, Blair does fall under ICC jurisdiction as Britain is a State Party.
Nat Hentoff wrote on August 28, 2007, that a leaked report by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the July 2007 report by Human Rights First and Physicians for Social Responsibility, titled "Leave No Marks: Enhanced Interrogation Techniques and the Risk of Criminality", might be used as evidence of American war crimes if there was a Nuremberg-like trial regarding the War on Terror.
Shortly before the end of President Bush's second term, newsmedia in countries other than the U.S. began publishing the views of those who believe that under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the U.S. is obligated to hold those responsible for prisoner abuse to account under criminal law. One proponent of this view was the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Professor Manfred Nowak) who, on January 20, 2009, remarked on German television that former president George W. Bush had lost his head of state immunity and under international law the U.S. would now be mandated to start criminal proceedings against all those involved in these violations of the UN Convention Against Torture. Law professor Dietmar Herz explained Nowak's comments by saying that under U.S. and international law former President Bush is criminally responsible for adopting torture as interrogation tool.

Kevin Griffith

Kevin Griffith (born 17 January 1950) is a former English cricketer who played first-class and List A cricket for Worcestershire between 1967 and 1972.
Griffith made his first-class debut against Leicestershire in late August 1967, scoring 11 and 0 and going wicketless in his four overs.
He played one more game that season, taking the single wicket of Leicestershire's Peter Marner,
and three more in 1968, but did not achieve any notable successes.
1969 was the first season in which Griffith played a significant part, turning out in nine first-class and one List A games. Against Oxford University in June, he claimed a second-innings 7/41, comfortably his best first-class innings return.
He played just one first-team game in 1970, being almost entirely confined to the Second XI.
In 1971, he played a substantial part in Worcestershire's season, appearing in 24 first-class games while scoring 575 runs at just under 20 and taking 32 wickets at a little over 37. He also played 14 List A matches. It was in 1971 that Griffith had his best match for Worcestershire, versus Yorkshire in early June: he made 42 and 59 (his only half-century) and took four second-innings wickets as Worcestershire ran out comfortable winners.
In 1972 Griffith played several games early on, including the tour match against the Australians,
but was increasingly relegated to the Second XI. Indeed, his last two first-team games — both in the John Player League — were 11 weeks apart.

St Laurence's Church, Northfield

St. Laurence's Church, Northfield is a parish church in the Church of England in Northfield, Birmingham.
History.
The Grade I listed church dates from the 12th century and contains some of the finest Early English work in the county. It also has a rare 14th-century timber porch outside the south door.
The north aisle was added in 1900 by George Frederick Bodley.
The gridiron associated with the martyrdom of St. Laurence can be seen in the stonework of the church tower.
Patronage.
Keble College, Oxford own the Advowson to the Rectory.
Bells.
The ring of eight bells was increased to ten on 20 November 1999. At the same time a new ground floor ringing chamber was created at the foot of the tower.
Stained Glass Windows.
The beautiful depth of colour and ornate designs of the windows are masterpieces contributed to the work of Hardman & Co. They also designed and made stained glass windows for St. Andrew's Cathedral and St. Mary's Cathedrals in Sydney, Australia as well as for the Houses of Parliament in London, including a window in the House of Lords'. Almost all of the windows in this historic Church of St. Laurence are by Hardman, replicating 13th-century stained-glass designs accurately through expert techniques and attention to detail. Hardman's windows include the subjects of: The Passion of Christ, The Resurrection, The Adoration, The Nativity, The Presentation in the temple before Simeon, The Annunciation, The descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, Our Lord's appearance to St. Thomas, The Transfiguration, Walking on the waters of the Sea of Galilee, Raising of Lazarus, to name but a few. There is also a window by Pugin and Kempe.
The church tower and the Chancel date back to the 12th/13th century AD. There is a Lady Chapel dedicated in the South Aisle and a chapel dedicated to St. Laurence in the North Aisle. The site of this Norman church was probably the previous location of a Saxon church as a priest was mentioned here in "Nordfeld" in the Domesday Book of 1086.
War Graves.
The churchyard extension, which lies between Kings Norton and Bristol Road, contains war graves of sixteen service personnel, one of World War I and fifteen of World War II.

<doc id="20278129" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20278129" title="Lag (online gaming)">
Lag (online gaming)

In online gaming, lag is a noticeable delay between the action of players and the reaction of the server. Although lag may be caused by high latency, it may also occur due to insufficient processing power in the client and/or server.
The tolerance for lag depends heavily on the type of game. For instance, a strategy game or a turn-based game with a low pace may have a high threshold or even be mostly unaffected by high delays, whereas a twitch gameplay game such as a first-person shooter with a considerably higher pace may require significantly lower delay to be able to provide satisfying gameplay. But, the specific characteristic of the game matter. For example, fast chess is a turn-based game that is fast action and may not tolerate high lag. And, some twitch games can be designed such that only events that impact the outcome of the game introduce lag, allowing for fast local response most of the time.
Causes.
Hardware related issues causes lag due to the fundamental structure of the game architecture. Generally, games consists of a looped sequence of states, or "frames". During each frame, the game accepts user input, performs necessary calculations (AI, graphics etc.). When all processing is finished, the game will update the game state and produce an output, for example in the form of a new image on the screen and/or a packet to be sent to the server. The frequency at which frames are generated is often referred to as the frame rate. As the central game state is located on the server, the updated information must be sent from the client to the server in order to take effect. In addition, the client must receive the necessary information from the server in order to fully update the state. Generating packets to send to the server and processing the received packets can only be done as often as the client is able to update its local state. Although packets could theoretically be generated and sent faster than this, it would only result in sending redundant data if the game state cannot be updated between each packet. A low frame rate would therefore make the game less responsive to updates and may force it to skip outdated data.
Conversely, the same hold true for the server. The frame rate (or tick rate) of the server determines how often it can process data from clients and send updates.
This type of problem is difficult to predict and compensate for. Apart from enforcing minimum hardware requirements and attempting to optimize the game for better performance, there are no feasible ways to deal with it.
Perhaps the most common type of lag is caused by network performance problems. Losses, corruption or jitter (an outdated packet is in effect a loss) may all cause problems, but these problems are relatively rare in network with sufficient bandwidth and no or little congestion. Instead, the latency involved in transmitting data between clients and server play a significant role. Latency varies depending on a number of factors, such as the physical distance between the end-systems, as a longer distance means additional transmission length and routing required and therefore higher latency. Routing over the Internet may be extremely indirect, resulting in far more transmission length (and consequential latency) than a direct route, although the cloud gaming service OnLive has developed a solution to this issue by establishing peering relationships with multiple Tier 1 network Internet Service Providers and choosing an optimal route between server and user. In addition, insufficient bandwidth and congestion, even if not severe enough to cause losses, may cause additional delays regardless of distance. As with the hardware issues, packets that arrive slowly or not at all will make both the client and server unable to update the game state in a timely manner.
Online game systems utilizing a wireless network may be subject to significant lag, depending on the architecture of the wireless network and local electromagnetic interference impacting that network. Although radio propagation through air is faster than light through optical fiber, wireless systems are often shared among many users and may suffer from latency incurred due to network congestion, or due to network protocols that introduce latency. And, in the event of electromagnetic interference, transmitted packets may be lost, requiring a retransmission which also incurs latency.
Effects.
The noticeable effects of lag vary depending on the exact cause, but also on any and all techniques for lag compensation that the game may implement (described below). As all clients experience some amount of delay, implementing these methods to minimize the effect on players is important for smooth gameplay. Lag causes numerous problems for issues such as accurate rendering of the game state and hit detection. In many games, lag is often frowned upon because it disrupts normal gameplay. The severity of lag depends on the type of game and its inherent tolerance for lag. Some games with a slower pace can tolerate significant delays without any need to compensate at all, where as others with a faster pace are considerably more sensitive and requires extensive use of compensation to be playable (most prevalent is probably the first-person shooter genre). Due to the various problems lag can cause, many players that have a lower speed Internet connection are often not permitted, or discouraged from playing with other players or servers that have a distant server host or have high latency to one another. Extreme cases of lag may result in extensive desynchronization of the game state.
Lag caused by an insufficient update rate between client and server can cause some problems, but these are generally limited to the client itself. Other players may notice jerky movement and similar problems for the affected client, but the real problem lies with the client itself. If the client cannot update the game state at a quick enough pace, the player may be shown outdated renditions of the game, which in turn causes various problems with hit- and collision detection. If the low update rate is caused by a low frame rate (as opposed to a setting on the client, as some games allow), these problems are usually overshadowed by numerous problems related to the client-side processing itself. Both the display and controls will be sluggish and unresponsive. While this may increase the perceived lag, it is important to note that it is of a different kind than network-related delays.
In comparison, the same problem on the server may cause significant problems for all clients involved. If the server is unable or unwilling to accept packets from clients fast enough and process these in a timely manner, client actions may never be registered. When the server then sends out updates to the clients, they may experience freezing (unresponsive game) and/or rollbacks, depending on what types of lag compensation, if any, the game uses.
Lag due to network delay is in contrast often less of a problem. Though more common, the actual effects are generally smaller, and it is possible to compensate for these types of delays. Without any form of lag compensation, the clients will notice that the game responds only a short time after an action is performed. This is especially problematic in first-person shooters, where enemies are likely to move as a player attempts to shoot them and the margin for errors is often small.
Solutions and lag compensation.
There are various methods for reducing or disguising delays, though many of these have their drawbacks and may not be applicable in all cases. If synchronization is not possible by the game itself, the clients themselves may be able to choose to play on servers in geographical proximity to themselves in order to reduce latencies, or the servers may simply opt to drop clients with high latencies in order to avoid having to deal with the resulting problems. However, these are hardly optimal solutions. Instead, games will often be designed with lag compensation in mind.
Many problems can be solved simply by allowing the clients to keep track of their own state and send absolute states to the server or directly to other clients. For example, the client can state exactly at what position it is or who they shot. This solution works and will all but eliminate most problems related to lag. Unfortunately, it also relies on the assumption that the client is honest. There is nothing that prevents a player from modifying the data they send, directly at the client or indirectly via a proxy, in order to ensure they will always hit their targets. In online games, the risk of cheating may make this solution infeasible, and clients will be limited to sending relative states (i.e. which vector it moved or shot in).
Client-side.
As clients are normally not allowed to define the main game state, but rather receive it from the server, the main task of the client-side compensation is to render the virtual world as accurately as possible. As updates come with a delay and may even be dropped, it is sometimes necessary for the client to predict the flow of the game. Since the state is updated in discrete steps, the client must be able to estimate a movement based on available samples. Two basic methods can be used to accomplish this; extrapolation and interpolation.
Extrapolation is an attempt to estimate a future game state. As soon as a packet from the server is received, the position of an object is updated to the new position. Awaiting the next update, the next position is extrapolated based on the current position and the movement at the time of the update. Essentially, the client will assume that a moving object will continue in the same direction. When a new packet is received, the position may be corrected slightly.
Interpolation works by essentially buffering a game state and rendering the game state to the player with a slight, constant delay. When a packet from the server arrives, instead of updating the position of an object immediately, the client will start to interpolate the position, starting from the last known position. Over an interpolation interval, the object will be rendered moving smoothly between the two positions. Ideally this interval should exactly match the delay between packets, but due to loss and variable delay, this is rarely the case.
Both methods have advantages and drawbacks.
Often, in order to allow smooth gameplay, the client is allowed to do soft changes to the game state. While the server may ultimately keep track of ammunition, health, position etc., the client may be allowed to predict the new server-side game state based on the player's actions, such as allowing a player to start moving before the server has responded to the command. These changes will generally be accepted under normal conditions and make delay mostly transparent. Problems will arise only in the case of high delays or losses, when the clients predictions are very noticeably undone by the server. Sometimes, in the case of minor differences, the server may even allow "incorrect" changes to the state based on updates from the client.
Server-side.
Unlike clients the server knows the exact current game state, and as such prediction is unnecessary. The main purpose of server-side lag compensation is instead to provide accurate effects of client actions. This is important because by the time a player's command has arrived time will have moved on, and the world will no longer be in the state that the player saw when issuing their command. A very explicit example of this is hit detection for weapons fired in first-person shooters, where margins are small and can potentially cause significant problems if not properly handled.
Do nothing.
One potential "solution" is to simply ignore the problem. For hit detection in first-person shooters this means leading one's target, aiming at the position where it will be by the time the shot reaches the server. With variable latency this may be frustrating even under ideal conditions; with higher latency and random player movement it can make playing virtually impossible. For example, if a remote player passes by a window in a period shorter than the client's latency it will be impossible for the local player to hit them even if they fire immediately.
However, doing nothing does have the advantage of giving players the truest possible picture of what is happening to their input. In games where the player can only exert indirect control, such as RTS games, it is considered acceptable for the local player's troops to be lagged as long as his or her direct inputs (typically cursor position, unit selection, and camera position) are responsive.
Rewind time.
Another way to address the issue is to store past game states for a certain length of time, then rewind player locations when processing a command. The server uses the latency of the player (including any inherent delay due to interpolation; see above) to rewind time by an appropriate amount in order to determine what the shooting client saw at the time the shot was fired. This will usually result in the server seeing the client firing at the target's old position and thus hitting. In the worst case a player will be so far behind that the server runs out of historic data and they have to start leading their targets.
This is a WYSIWYG solution that allows players to aim directly at what they are seeing. But the price is an aggravation of the effects of latency when a player is under fire: not only does their own latency play a part, but their attacker's too. In many situations this is not noticeable, but players who have just taken cover will notice that they carry on receiving damage/death messages from the server for longer than their own latency can justify. This can lead more often to the (false) impression that they were shot through cover and the (not entirely inaccurate) impression of "laggy hitboxes".
The effects of rewinding can be seen from the perspective of both parties in this video.
One design issue that arises from rewinding is whether to stop rewinding a dead player's lagged commands as soon as they die on the server, or to continue running them until they "catch up" to the time of death. Cutting compensation off immediately prevents victims from posthumously attacking their killers, which meets expectations, but preserves the natural advantage of moving players who round a corner, acquire a target and kill them in less time than a round trip to the stationary victim's client.
Rewinding can be criticised for allowing the high latency of one player to negatively affect the experience of low-latency players. Servers with lag compensation will sometimes reduce the length of player history stored, or enforce ping limits, to reduce this problem.
Trust clients.
It is possible for clients to tell the server what they are doing and for the server to trust the data it receives. This method is avoided if at all possible due to its susceptibility to cheating: it is a simple matter to route network data through a second computer which inserts fabricated hit messages or modifies existing ones, a technique which cannot be detected by anti-cheat tools.
However, the sheer scale of some games makes computationally expensive solutions like rewinding impossible. In "Battlefield 3", for example, a "hybrid hit detection" system is used where clients tell the server that they hit and the server performs only a vague test of plausibility before accepting the claim.
Trusting a client's results otherwise has the same advantages and disadvantages as rewinding.
Make clients extrapolate.
A less common lag solution is to do nothing on the server and to have each client extrapolate (see above) to cover its latency. This produces incorrect results unless remote players maintain a constant velocity, granting an advantage to those who dodge back and forth or simply start/stop moving.
Extended extrapolation also results in remote players becoming visible (though not vulnerable) when they should not be: for example if a remote player sprints up to a corner then stops abruptly at the edge, other clients will render them sprinting onward, into the open, for the duration of their own latency. On the other side of this problem, clients have to give remote players who just started moving an extra burst of speed in order to push them into a theoretically-accurate predicted location.
Design.
It is possible to reduce the perception of lag through game design. Techniques include playing client-side animations as if the action took place immediately, reducing/removing built-in timers on the host machine, and using camera transitions to hide warping.

This Checklist is divided into 3 parts, high, medium, low. This refers to the effect of the issue on your ping. And just after the issue in brackets there is a letter (Easy, Medium, Hard), which represent how easy the fix for the issue. This is taken from Online Gaming Ping/Lag/Latency Reduce Checklist
Cloud gaming.
Cloud gaming is a type of online gaming where the entire game is hosted on a game server in a data center, and the user is only running a thin client locally that forwards game controller actions upstream to the game server. The game server then renders the next frame of the game video which is compressed using low-lag video compression and is sent downstream and decompressed by the thin client. For the cloud gaming experience to be acceptable, the round-trip lag of all elements of the cloud gaming system (the thin client, the Internet and/or LAN connection the game server, the game execution on the game server, the video and audio compression and decompression, and the display of the video on a display device) must be low enough that the user perception is that the game is running locally. Because of such tight lag requirements, distance considerations of the speed of light through optical fiber come into play, currently limiting the distance between a user and a cloud gaming game server to approximately 1000 miles, according to OnLive, the only company thus far operating a cloud gaming service.
There is also much controversy about the lag associated with cloud gaming. In typical multiplayer games the player's computer renders the game's graphics locally and only information about the player's in-game actions are sent to the server. For example when the player presses a button, the character on-screen instantly performs the corresponding action. However, the consequences of the action such as an enemy being killed are only seen after a short delay due to the time taken for the action to reach the server. This is acceptable since as long as the player's character responds instantly the player still feels in complete control.
With cloud gaming when the player presses a button, nothing appears to happen for a short while. The button press must first be transmitted to the remote server, which takes time. Then the server must start rendering the graphics of the action being performed and stream the video back to the player over the network, which again takes time. Thus the player experiences a noticeable delay between pressing a button and seeing something happen on-screen. Depending on the skill & experience of the player, this can cause disorientation and confusion similar to Delayed Auditory Feedback and hampers navigation & aiming in the game world. When rapidly inputting a long combination move, the on-screen character will not be synchronized with the button presses. This usually causes severe confusion in the player resulting in the failure of the combination move.
The extra input lag can also make it very difficult to play certain single player games. For example, if an enemy takes a swing at the player and the player is expected to block, then by the time the player's screen shows that the enemy has commenced attacking, the enemy would have already struck and killed the player on the server.

The Daily News (Kentucky)

The Daily News is a daily newspaper based in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It is published Saturday and Sunday mornings and Monday through Friday evenings.
The current newspaper can trace its roots to the "Bowling Green Democrat" founded in 1854. A rival paper, "The Daily Times", was founded by John B. Gaines in 1882 and the newspapers eventually merged into the predecessor to the "Park City Daily News"; now named the Daily News. The newspaper is still owned by members of the Gaines family.
When the paper was called the "Park City Daily News", the name was chosen due to a nickname for Bowling Green taken from an 1892 speech by Henry Watterson. Watterson, there to commemorate Fountain Square Park as the city's first park, opined that Bowling Green might come to be known as the "beautiful park city." Local businesses widely adopted the nickname until the town of Glasgow Junction, about 20 miles north, changed its name to Park City, Kentucky, and the now-confusing nickname fell from local favor.
"The Daily News" acquired "The Amplifier", a local arts monthly, in 2007.

Tartaglia is a dainty character in the Commedia dell'arte. He is farsighted and with a minor stutter (hence his name; cf. Spanish tartamudear), he is usually classed as one of the group of old characters (vecchio) who appears in many scenarios as one of the lovers (innamorati). His social status varies; he is sometimes a bailiff, lawyer, notary or chemist. Dramatist Carlo Gozzi turned him into a statesman, and so he remained thereafter. Tartaglia wears a large felt hat, an enormous cloak, oversized boots, a long sword, a giant moustache and a cardboard nose. He usually represents the lower working class but at times the middle or upper class in the commedia dell'arte. In the opera "Le maschere" by Mascagni, one of the characters is Tartaglia, a stuttering servant. 
Tartaglia is depicted as the voluble Sgt. Gino Tartaglia, played by Charles Calvert, in the radio crime drama Broadway Is My Beat. His characteristics formed the basis of Porky Pig.

Lottia pelta, common name the shield limpet, is a species of sea snail, a true limpet, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Lottiidae. It is still designated under its synonym "Collisella pelta" (Eschscholtz, 1833) in many textbooks.
Distribution.
The shield limpet is found in the intertidal zone on rocks and kelp holdfast from Alaska to Baja California. The largest specimens occur in the northern part of the range. 
Description.
This shell of this species grows to a width of between 2.5 and 5.4 cm on a broadly elliptical to oval base. It is only moderately elevated. The apex is tilted toward the front end and the sides of the shell are slightly convex. The color of the shell is grayish with irregular, radial stripes. When "Lottia pelta" moves among substrata the morphology and the color of its shell changes. The ontogenetic record of its past habitats is preserved in the shell structure. The species found on kelp holdfasts have darker shells with obscure ribbing.
The sculpture of the shell is smooth or with irregular, fine radial riblets. Occasionally they become heavy ribs.
The interior of the shell has about the same color as the exterior. There is a dark brown central spot. The base of the interior is marked by alternating dark and light spots.
One of its predators is "Ocenebra lurida" (Middendorff, 1849), a murex snail.

National Association for Court Management

The National Association for Court Management (NACM) is a non-profit organization in the United States that promotes professional management education for court administrators and judges.
In the United States and most other countries in the common law tradition, supervising judges continue their traditional role as the presiding authorities in the bureaucracy of court systems. However, the latter half of the twentieth century saw the increasing professionalization of non-judicial court administrators and staff. In many court systems today, responsibility for court operations is delegated almost entirely to professional court managers, freeing judges and their legal clerks to devote their time to the work of interpreting and applying the law.
NACM offers education, training, and professional certification programs in the principles of court management. These educational programs are designed both for non-judicial managers and for judges in their capacity to oversee court managers. NACM collaborates in training programs with Michigan State University, the National Center for State Courts, and the Institute for Court Management. NACM has also drafted a Model Code of Conduct for Court Professionals.
NACM was founded in 1985 through the combination of two pre-existing associations: the National Association of Trial Court Administrators (founded in 1965) and the National Association for Court Administration (founded in 1968). It claims to be the largest organization of court management professionals in the world, with more than 2,000 members from the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries.
The current president of NACM is Jude Del Preore, who also serves as the court administrator for Burlington County, New Jersey. NACM is headquartered in Williamsburg, Virginia.

The Harlan Daily Enterprise, a daily newspaper serving Harlan County, in the U.S. state of Kentucky, with a circulation of 6,000, was first published in 1901 as "The Harlan Enterprise" and began publishing in 1928 as "The Harlan Daily Enterprise".
The newspaper is published five times a week, Tuesday through Saturday, except on major holidays. Office hours are Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.
The newspaper is named in honor of the city and county which it serves. Those entities were named for Silas Harlan who was killed in 1782 while leading the advance party at the Battle of Blue Licks, the last major battle of the American Revolutionary War. Harlan is a distant relative of U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan.
History and demographics of Harlan County have presented both challenges and opportunities for the editorial staff of the newspaper as the coal-mining region it serves has been the site of labor disputes and a series of "boom and bust" cycles; a declining population since its highest level of 75,275 in the 1940 census down to 33,202 in the 2000 census with an estimate that the 2009 population has declined to 30,783, a 7.3% decline while the rest of Kentucky has an estimated growth of 5.6%; significant welfare rolls with an estimated 29.3% of residents living below the poverty level; and clearly divided socio-economic classes.
In recent years the newspaper has received numerous awards from the Kentucky Press Association's Excellence in KY Newspapers competition.
Ownership.
"The Harlan Daily Enterprise" was founded in 1901. It was locally owned until 1970, when it was sold to Worrell Newspapers of Charlottesville, Virginia. The New York Times Company acquired the "Enterprise" and seven other dailies from Worrell Newspapers in 1982. In 1990, the Times Company sold the "Enterprise" and the "Middlesboro Daily News" to American Publishing Company, later renamed Hollinger International. In 1998, the "Enterprise" was part of a 45-paper sale by Hollinger to Community Newspaper Holdings. In 2004, the "Enterprise" was part of a 22-paper sale by CNHI to Heartland Publications.

The Hazard Herald

The Hazard Herald is a weekly newspaper based in Hazard, Kentucky. The newspaper was founded by Bailey P. Wootton in 1911. The paper celebrated 100 years on June 22, 2011. Today the paper is located on High Street on downtown Hazard and comes out every Wednesday morning.
1911–1919.
The first edition of "The Hazard Herald" was hand set and came off the gasoline powered printing press on June 22, 1911. Though there doesn’t seem to be a copy of that first edition still in existence, the effect the "Herald" had on the local community during its first decade is certainly on record.
The "Herald" was operated by its founder and president at the time, Bailey P. Wootton, along with officers George W. Humphries, James B. Hoge and W.C. Trosper. 
During that first year, a one-year subscription to the "Herald" could be purchased for one dollar as the paper’s staff covered the growth of Hazard, which at the time was still looking forward to the coming of the railroad a year later, a move that would open up a town that in the years prior was a remote hamlet nearly cut off by the rough and tumble foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.
The first two years of the "Herald"’s publication were certainly not easy ones, as noted in Perry County Kentucky: A History, published by the Hazard Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution during the 1950s. A publisher in Hazard at that time certainly lacked some of the modern conveniences that newspaper staff today may take for granted: “With power still not available in 1911, a two H.P. gasoline engine was installed to run the press. After 1912, electricity was available and the changeover was made.”
In those first years the "Herald" also served as a chronicler of Hazard’s history (as it still does today). One of the most important events in that history was the arrival of the railroad. In the July 20, 1911 edition, the paper’s fifth that first year, a story details work being completed by the Jones-Davis Company regarding construction of a section of the L&E Railroad which extended “from below Yerkes to the head of the river of the mouth of Buckeye Creek, about 18 miles.”
The first train arrived in Hazard in 1912, and the railroad not only opened avenues of travel in and out of the county, but it also paved the way for a more robust coal industry, as noted in the "Herald"’s October 7, 1912 edition: “It will not be long before the coal from this city will be counted by the trainloads instead of the carload.”
Other notable events during the decade include a fire in December 1913 that ravaged the business section of town, destroying $50,000 worth of property, according to a headline of the day. Consumed in the fire was the D.Y. Combs Hotel as well as the offices of Drs. Gross and Hurst.
In August 1913, the "Herald" was instrumental in forming the Hazard Athletic Association, which was called for in the paper’s pages. “The primary object of the Association is base ball,” an article read. Elected as officers in the association were Bailey Wootton as president, J.B. Allen as vice president, J.B. Eversole as secretary and treasurer, and J.D. Stevens as manager. A membership fee of one dollar was required.
On August 17, 1914, the "Herald" reported on the first automobile to arrive in Perry County: “Last Thursday, Hazard and Perry county (sic) were honored by the first automobile ever inside the county limits. We have had the railroad trains upward of two years, and that has ceased to be a wonder; we have had one autocycle, which remained for a few days and departed from whence it came. But the crowning glory of all was the advent of the Ford touring car which passed though our city last Thursday. Now we are on the qui vive for the first aeroplane.”
By 1916, Wootton was still listed as the president, with James B. Hoge and W.C. Trosper as secretary and manager respectively, and a weekly editorial appeared in the newspaper as well. In the January 27, 1916 edition, the "Herald" took to task the City of Hazard for allowing the city’s sidewalks to fall in disrepair, writing: “In any case, there has been no excuse on the part of either Big Bottom residents or the City government for leaving the walks up that way in the shape it has been for such a long time.”
While the "Herald" maintained a local flavor during its first decade, in this age before the Internet and instant news delivery, the paper also made note of issues of national importance. By 1918, World War I ended with the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II on November 9. The "Herald" carried the story with the headline: “War Is Ended; Kaiser Abdicates.”
By the end of the decade, the paper’s yearly subscription rate had increased to $1.50 while Bailey Wootton remained the president of the "Herald" Publishing Company, and John B. Horton has been serving as the editor.
1920–1929.
The 1920s began with the "Herald"’s founder remaining in control as publisher. John B. Horton had been serving as the editor, and the "Herald" had also carried over from the previous decade a habit of weekly printing “The Herald’s Platform for Hazard,” which advocated for the following:
Still keeping in line with the publishing every Thursday, the "Herald" remained the county’s main source of information, and in 1922 moved into a new building on High Street.
It was also during this decade that new businesses were springing up, including the Mine Service Company in Lothair, which was described as the only “up-to-date machine and repair shop in this field and is as complete as any plant can be.”
The First State Bank of Vicco opened on March 23, 1923, and would later become Peoples Bank and Trust Company, while the Hazard Insurance Agency and the Perry insurance Agency merged in June 1928 to do business as The Hazard Insurance Agency, Inc.
It was also during this decade that the "Herald" began offering joint subscriptions with Kentucky’s oldest newspaper, The Courier-Journal of Louisville. A one-year subscription for both papers could be purchased for a tidy sum of $6. The "Herald" also began advertising its job department, which was equipped as a printer service, specializing in ruled mine forms.
Prohibition was a heavy topic during the 1920s, with regular arrests of moonshiners being made. In that same August 1923 edition of the "Herald", a story makes note of a raid in which “revenue officers under Lee Stewart were surrounded by moonshiners.” According to the article, three stills were destroyed in the raid.
In 1926, with Wootton remaining as publisher, Carroll Wilson became the editor and Arthur M. Hernon was serving as advertising manager.
It was perhaps a weather event that defined the decade for Hazard, as the flood of 1927 brought with it thousands of dollars worth of destruction, and the "Herald" was there to cover it. According to reports in the June 10, 1927 edition of "The Hazard Herald", the Lothair community of Perry County suffered a loss of approximately $200,000 in total. The report reads: “The combined loss of the four camps and the business section of Lothair from the flood has been estimated as being in the neighborhood of $200,000. The hardest hit was the Ky. & West Virginia Power Company, which suffered a loss of $75,000 in the plant and $12,000 in the camp.”
In 1928, the paper also covered the Carr Creek basketball team who made it to the state championship game. An editorial was published in March 1928 that praised the Carr Creek team as its members “live clean lives, think pure thoughts, go to bed early, study hard, are accustomed to physical hardships and are unspoiled by worshiping undergraduates and alumni.” 
The editorial noted that the Carr Creek boys were the talk of Richmond and Lexington, where tales of their exploits centered on their backwoods lifestyle, not being accustomed to trains and automobiles: “Their reason for success is not that they live in the ‘romantic’ Cumberlands, beyond the pale of civilization; but rather that they have not had the opportunity to become contaminated with the loose-living, fast-moving, sensation-seeking younger sets of our more thickly populated towns and cities.”
It was during this decade that the paper also began a second publication day, printing every Tuesday and Friday. 
In 1929, Overton S. Warren became editor-manager.
1930–1939.
The 1930s were a period of growth for the "Herald", with founder Bailey Wootton still head of the "Herald" Publishing Company, but his sights were also set on political office.
In 1931, Wootton, a Democrat, won the election for Kentucky’s Attorney General, and in 1935 was announced on the front page of "The Hazard Herald" as a “Probable Candidate” for governor. A small, one-column mugshot stood atop a cutline, which read: “Mr. Wootton, attorney general and chairman of the State Democratic Central Committee, is being mentioned as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Kentucky.”
Wootton did run in the Democratic primary, and lost to eventual governor A.B. “Happy” Chandler.
As the decade opened, W.L. Elliot was the "Herald"’s editor and manager, and community news items remained an important part of local coverage. In an item called “Town Talk” in the February 20, 1930 edition, such short and to-the-point items included the following: 
Little Phil Stutz is spending a few weeks with his grandmother in Lexington.
Mrs. G.H. Gilford is on the sick list this week.
Miss Pearl Groves, University of Kentucky, spent the week-end with her parents on Combs Street.
Commonwealth Attorney John Asher is very busy in Circuit Court this week.
Just as the success of the Carr Creek basketball squad in the 1920s brought sports coverage to the front page, Hazard High School’s own state championship team kept sports events front and center.
The "Herald"’s March 24, 1932 edition detailed Hazard’s “thrilling” victory over Louisville Male by a final score of 15-13 on a field goal by Morton Combs, which “crowned Hazard the best boys’ team in Kentucky.”
The "Herald"’s coverage included several letters of congratulation, including from Louisville Mayor W.B. Harrison, who wrote to Hazard Mayor J.C. Steele: “As long as the boys from my old school, Louisville Male High, had to be defeated, I know of no one to whom I would rather extend my congratulations than you.”
More than 1,000 people assembled on the square in Hazard to welcome the team, according to the "Herald"’s coverage, as they returned to town from the tournament in Lexington.
The Great Depression was also a major factor across the nation in the 1930s, and times at "The Hazard Herald" were no different. In his book, "The Hazard Herald and other Perry County Newspapers", Charles Wooton, who was first hired on at the "Herald" in 1933 as a printer’s devil, noted that “times were hard” at the paper, and O.S. Warren, the paper’s advertising manager, “had problems collecting enough from advertisers and job customers to meet payroll.”
The paper’s press was eventually repossessed, but Wooton was able to locate another press and kept the paper in print.
The "Herald" continued to cover local items of interest. On September 16, 1936, the paper carried the story of the death of Miss Katharine Pettit, founder of the Hindman Settlement School in Knott County. Pettit was a nationally renowned educator and winner of the Algernon Sidney Sullivan Award for outstanding service to the people of Kentucky.
Coal continued as heavy figure in the "Herald"’s coverage in 1937. A headline in the paper’s September 2 edition proclaims coal as “The First and Best Source of Power.” The resource was described as “black gold” in the same article in which plans were being made for the city’s Labor Day carnival, billed as the Hazard Coal Carnival. It was held on September 6 of that year, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Hazard coal fields. The carnival included a “mile long parade,” a fireworks display, the annual golf tournament and an hour of continuous entertainment, as well as the crowning of the Hazard Coal Queen.
The "Herald"’s staff at the time included Dan Roberts, a former mechanical supervisor, as vice president of the Heral' Publishing Company, and Charles Wooton was named editor and general manager. It was at this time, Wooton wrote, that business began to pick up as advertising and circulation increased.
Along with items of jubilation such as carnivals and state championships, the "Herald" also told the tales of the other side of society, just as it did on July 20, 1939 with the photo of Jack Davis, who was convicted of slaying Abram Combs on July 8, 1938. Davis, the item noted, was set to die by electric chair at midnight on July 20.
Only two weeks later, on August 4, 1939, "The Hazard Herald" became "The Hazard Daily Herald", printed every evening except Sundays to keep the public informed on news of the fighting in Europe that would eventually draw in the United States and spark World War II.
1940–1949.
"The Hazard Herald" went through many changes in the 1940s. 
In 1939 Germany invaded Poland and local people wanted a way to quickly get up-to-date news about the war in Europe. The only daily papers that could be bought in the region were from Louisville and Lexington and were a day old by the time they got to Perry County. As a result, "The Hazard Herald" became a daily newspaper in August 1939 and printed six days a week throughout the 1940s. 
Bailey Wootton continued as publisher, although mostly ceremonially, from Frankfort. Charles Wooton was made editor-manager of the paper. 
Charles Wooton hired a public relations and advertising businessman named Ivey Peebles. Peebles was from Jackson, Mississippi. He started selling advertising with year-long contracts which had never been done before at "The Hazard Herald". 
With the change in staffing and frequency of printing came a name change, "The Hazard Daily Herald". The paper became a member of the Associated Press Wire Service that gave them rights to up-to-date war news that could be printed in the paper and delivered to residents of Perry County in a timely manor. 
The circulation rate went up to over 4,000 and could be bought for 25 cents a week. The papers were sold in stores that surrounded coal mines called “Little Merchant.” 
Staff at "The Hazard Daily Herald" started to gain recognition for their efforts when they won second place as best small daily for the state of Kentucky in 1940. 
In 1941, Bailey Wootton and his family returned to Hazard from Frankfort after spending a term as Kentucky Attorney General and a term as Director of the Department of Forestry. He continued as publisher, although in a more active role. 
Wootton’s wife, Clara Wootton, was added to the staff of "The Hazard Daily Herald". Charles Wooton and Clara Wootton had difficulty working together, Wooton noted in his book about the history of newspapers in Perry County. 
At this time, Charles Wooton and his father owned the majority of the stock in the company. Wooton’s father, E.C. Wooton, had been a partner in Bailey Wootton’s law firm and gave his shares to him. Bailey then bought five more shares in the company. This gave him the controlling number of shares. 
Bailey then bought out the rest of Charles’s shares in the paper. Charles then decided to leave the company.
"The Hazard Daily Herald" printed war news on the front cover of nearly every issue through 1945. They had such headlines as: “Hiroshima becomes valley of the dead” and “Third fleet roaming in Japs waters.”
After the Japanese surrender during World War II, Hazard residents held a citywide celebration. The spontaneous party was described in the "Herald" as one of the “greatest and noisiest in city’s history.”
After the war the "Herald" continued as a daily paper. They still used the wire service for many national and international stories, although they began turning their focus back to more local issues. 
Bailey P. Wootton had been president and publisher of the "Herald" since he founded it, but in 1945 he relinquished control and George L. Carey became publisher, with R. W. Griffith as managing editor. 
In 1948 Perry County was gripped with a debate over becoming a wet or dry county. The July 4 headline read “Perry Votes Wet.” The previous paper, July 2, 1948, had five advertisements urging voters to vote to be a wet county. 
During the 1940s, the "Herald" ran a weekly “funnies” section that could be bought for just 10 cents. The section came out on Sundays and boasted some of the first color printing the newspaper had ever used. 
In the latter part of the 1940s, R.D. Maney replaced R.W. Griffith as manager-editor, and Leslie Wilson was made news editor. 
Bailey Wootton moved back to Frankfort in 1946, where he would die of cancer at the age of 79, on April 16, 1949. He was buried in Frankfort Cemetery. 
In 1949 the Hazard radio station, WKIC, bought the "Herald", which for a time carried the slogan:“Read it in the Herald, hear on WKIC.”
1950–1959.
"The Hazard Herald" continued as a daily paper throughout most of the 1950s, switching to a twice weekly in the latter part of the decade.
The newspaper was printed six days a week through 1956. In the early 1950s the newspaper continued to use the AP’s wire service. The paper continued to be owned and printed by the Hazard Publishing Company. Fred B. Bullard was the publisher with John Potisek as editor.
In 1953, the newspaper started to focused more on local news. After several years, the paper stopped using the wire service.
The newspaper started to print fewer pages but with more of their own reporting. During this time, Kyle Whitehead was made publisher and managing editor and Otis Perkins editor.
The year 1956 marked a large amount of change in Perry County as well as in "The Hazard Herald". Perry County Schools began to be integrated in the fall of 1956 after the school board decided to close the only African American school in the county by the end of the school year in 1957. Students were given the choice to stay at their African American school for that year or enroll at a different school. 
That year also saw a change in ownership for the "Herald" . The owners of the Mountain Eagle, Martha and Pearl Nolan, of Whitesburg, Kentucky, decided to sell their paper and bought the "Herald" . The Nolan’s turned the paper into a twice a week paper that printed on Mondays and Thursdays. W.P. Nolan was the Publisher and Fred W. Luigart Jr. managing editor.
While the Nolans owned the paper, they began running local sections like “Roscoe’s Roundup,” “Back thru the years” and “Women’s Section.”
“Roscoe’s Roundup” was written by Roscoe Davis, a famous and beloved Hazard native. It addressed local issues, gave opinions and had amusing rants. The section ran weekly on Thursdays. 
“Back thru the years” gave stories that had become part of Perry County history. The section gave headlines from that week in past issues of the "Herald". 
“Women’s Section” was promoted as “news of interest to women.” The section included primarily gossip, with the occasional birth or wedding announcement. The section had three reporters whose phone numbers and addresses were given in case someone had a good bit of gossip they felt should be put in the paper. 
In 1956, the Nolan’s moved the "Herald" offices to a building on North Main Street. Previous to the move, the newspaper had been in the Herald Building, which was built by the paper’s founder, Bailey P. Wootton. 
The largest flood recorded in Hazard happened on January 29, 1957. The North Fork of the Kentucky River rose 38 feet and flooded all of Main Street. Businesses all along Main Street were destroyed. According to records, over 50 homes were swept off their foundations.
"The Hazard Herald"’s new office was hit hard by the floodwater. The office lost a lot of equipment, but more importantly nearly all of the archived newspapers from the early days of the paper were destroyed. The only copies of the papers from before the 1940s that exist can be found on microfilm at the Perry County Library.
1960–1969.
In the early 1960s, "The Hazard Herald" was a “semi-weekly” newspaper, publishing twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays. Martha and Pearl Nolan remained as owners.
During this decade the staff also put out a weekly paper called the Mountain Messenger, which was slated as being “published in the interest of the people of Knott, Leslie, and Perry County.”
The Publisher was W. P. Nolan and Fred W. Luigart was the managing editor in 1960, but was replaced by W.P. Nolan who took on the role of both editor and publisher. Nolan remained the editor and publisher throughout the rest of the 1960s and into the 1970s. 
The only other person to hold an editor position during the 1960s was Gurney Norman. Norman was from Allais and went to the University of Kentucky and earned a degree in English and journalism. He then joined the army for two years.
In 1963 he returned to Eastern Kentucky and became a staff writer for the "Herald". He had written for the newspaper since the late 1950s but had not joined the staff. By 1964 he was listed as assistant editor. 
Norman was with the paper until 1966 when he left to focus on his fiction writing. He went on to become a well-known author and professor at the University of Kentucky. In 2009 he was named Kentucky’s poet laureate. 
In November 1963 President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. "The Hazard Herald" ran an article about the passing of the president on the front page their Thanksgiving issue. 
One of the largest changes to the community was the forming of Hazard ARH. The largest hospital in Hazard had been The Miners Memorial Hospital, which was operated by United Mine Workers Welfare and Retirement Fund. The Fund ran ten hospitals in the region since the mid-1950s. In 1963, Appalachian Regional Hospitals was formed and took over these 10 facilities, forming Hazard ARH and creating a well-rounded healthcare system. 
Ever since the Nolans took over the newspaper the focus shifted toward local content written by local reporters. This became an even larger part of the paper as more and more people had access to national television broadcasts and no longer counted on the newspaper for national news. 
Several local reoccurring columns emerged like “Hill Talk,” which focused on events at the area schools. 
There was also “Potpourri,” which was written by Louisa B Hatmaker. “Potpourri” was a gossip column that also had announcements as well as opinions marketed toward women. This column replaced “Women’s Section” of the 1950s.
“Roscoe’s Round-Up” had been first introduced in the 1956 and was written by Roscoe Davis. The column appeared weekly and gave opinions and discussed his experiences and the experiences of other residents. 
In February 1968 Robert F. Kennedy came to Hazard as a part of his Tour of Appalachia. He announced his candidacy for president within a week of coming to Hazard. 
According to news reports at the time, residents feared that Senator Kennedy’s visit was going to be a publicity stunt showing the people of Eastern Kentucky as backwards “and with out hope.” Once he announced his candidacy for president it became apparent that this tour was a campaign stop. 
In July 1969 Apollo 11 carried the first human to the moon. The "Herald" put the news on the front page of the July 24 issue with the headline reading “Apollo 11 Lands Safely.”
1970–1979.
W.P. Nolan was the publisher and editor of the "Herald" as the 1970s began, and a one-year subscription could be purchased for $10.50 for local residents.
For both the "Herald" and for its town, the decade marked a number of changes. In Hazard, several businesses sprang up and a new mayor was elected in 1978 who would help transform the face of the city over the next three decades.
Competition was also a steady influence on the "Herald" in the 1970s, especially from the East Kentucky Voice, owned and operated by former "Herald" reporter Oscar Combs, who has since gone on to head the successful and popular Cats Pause magazine. 
Combs operated the Voice until 1975 which, according to Charles Wooton, which “became a topnotch weekly and grew rapidly, making heavy inroads on all newspaper circulation and advertising in Perry County.”
The year 1975 was a busy one for the "Herald" as it was sold to Worrell Newspapers and Donald Gipson was named president and publisher. The paper’s office moved to East Main Street, and it was that same year the "Herald" and "The East Kentucky Voice" merged, forming the "Hazard Herald-Voice" newspaper, with Gipson staying on as publisher and Edmund Shelby as news editor.
In an editorial published in the October 20, 1975 edition of the "Herald-Voice", Gipson announced the merger and noted an “increased sense of responsibility for providing fair and thorough news coverage and responsible advertising.”
Billed as the “Courier of the East Kentucky Coal Fields,” the "Herald-Voice" continued publishing each week, just as the City of Hazard continued to grow.
New businesses and other areas of progress were springing up across the county. The Daniel Boone Parkway (now called Hal Rogers Parkway), extending from Hazard to London, opened in June 1975, while construction began on the Hazard Magic Mart three months later. The Citizens Bank, now known as Community Trust, opened a branch on Main Street in April 1975.
Perhaps the most defining event of the decade came in November 1977 as Hazard businessman William D. Gorman was elected mayor, defeating Lester Roberts by more than 800 votes. It was Gorman’s first term as an elected official in the city, and it was an office he would hold until his death in October 2010. 
Gorman’s tenure at City Hall was as successful as it was lengthy. He oversaw the construction of the new City Hall, the expansion of the city interests to what is now referred to as “Hospital Hill,” Jacklot Hollow and the Daniel Boone Shopping Center, and was present to help introduce a myriad of new businesses to the area. He also played an important role in the expansion of water service to several areas of the county, making water service one of his number one priorities while in office. 
Mayor Gorman would also become a frequent name on the front page of the "Herald" over the next 30 years, but change with the "Herald"’s staff was also continuing. The decade ended with Berkely F. Scott as publisher, Bobby Watson as general manager and editor, and Erin O’ Donnell as associate editor.
1980–1989.
"The Hazard Herald" became "The Herald-Voice" in 1975 and remained the "Herald-Voice" throughout the 1980s. The newspaper was weekly and came out every Thursday. 
Scripps Newspaper League bought the Newspaper in 1978 and continued to publish the paper until 1988 when it was then published by the Perry County Publishing Company. Jack Thomas was the editor and publisher of the paper throughout the 1980s. 
While Scripps owned the newspaper, the staff had more editors than they would have for the rest of the decade. They wrote more stories for the paper, making it a near entirely local paper. 
The newspaper began to run profiles of people within the community frequently. In 1981, they had the “Pep Spotlight” which showed members of the local cheer squads as well and the “Players of the week,” showing football and basketball players from M.C. Napier High School and Hazard High School. 
The newspaper also began showcasing the history of Hazard by running pieces about local historical events on the front page. Many of the pieces were taken from old papers. 
The paper also boasted a food and nutrition section. The section gave tips on creating healthy meals, how to keep leftovers and recipes. The food section also had news stories pertaining to raising food prices. This section was a great way for advertisers to focus on a specific consumer, so the section held all of the food ads as well as weekly coupons. 
In September 1981, for the Black Gold Festival the stars of the “Dukes of Hazzard” came to Hazard, Ky. The attendance for the festival was the highest it had ever been with thousands turning out to see the television stars. The "Herald-Voice" reported that 100,000 spectators turned out to see the “Dukes” opening parade of the festival. 
In 1988, plans were made for a mall to come to Hazard. The Black Gold Shopping Mall’s plans were revealed on May 18. Ground was broken for the center the same day, and the mall was to be the first of its kind in Perry County and was slated to cost $50 million. The shopping center was to hold a JC Penney, Watsons and Walmart. 
In October 1989 flooding hit Hazard, causing the North Fork of the Kentucky River to rise to 27 feet. According to the "Herald-Voice", the flooding was sudden and was the first major flood in over five years. 
"The Hazard Herald-Voice" celebrated its 200th paper under that name on September 14, 1989. The paper had changed names five times at this point in its 79-year existence.
1990–1999.
Still more changes were in store at the "Herald" as 1989 gave way to a new decade. 
Jack Thomas remained publisher while Rex Boggs continued as editor, a combination that would remain intact until October 1994.
The "Herald"’s sports pages also gained a now well-known name as Jay Crawford pulled double duty, reporting also for WYMT-TV. As many know, Crawford has since gone on to gain notoriety as the host of ESPN’s “Second Take.”
Much like the previous two decades, the City of Hazard saw a lot of progress during the decade, first in March 1990 as construction got underway at the Black Gold Mall for fast food restaurant Rax and the Watson’s and JC Penney department stores. Walmart had opened it doors there the year before.
In 1994, as several officials were sworn into office following the 1993 election, the staff at the "Herald" remained the same, but only 10 months later Editor Rex Boggs announced his departure on the front page, as Publisher Jack Thomas took over editing duties as well. 
During the 1990s, color also became a mainstay on the front page, where grayscale photography had been the norm. Red lettering marked the occasion when the M.C. Napier Lady Navajos took home the state basketball championship, while a story just below marked the end of an era for local radio broadcasting as Ernest Sparkman was set to call his final Sweet 16 game on radio station WSGS. 
The "Herald" also began reporting on a more disturbing trend in the mountains – illegal drug trafficking. A May 19, 1994 story written by Boggs details the arrest of 27 people in Perry County on suspicion of dealing illegal drugs. Such roundups would become a sad part of life in the mountains in the coming years. 
While several new businesses began during the decade, one in particular was celebrating a milestone. In October 1994, Home Lumber Company marked 80 years in business as a front page spread on the October 27 edition included comments and photos from the Morton family, who have been a part of the business since its beginning.
Another personnel change for the "Herald"’s staff was announced on October 2, 1997, as Mike Rindahl was named publisher and Paul David Taulbee was promoted to managing editor while Midge Bowling remained advertising manager. Owned by American Publishing Company out of Marion, Illinois, the "Herald-Voice", as it was known then, cost 50 cents per copy, and a one-year subscription could be purchased for $17. The following year, Jenny Jones was named circulation manager, a position which she still holds at the paper today.
It was on October 9, 1997, without any fanfare, that the paper reverted back to its old title, "The Hazard Herald", and dropped the “Voice” all together. 
The following year, the paper covered another significant local election during which a one-term Magistrate named Denny Ray Noble captured the county judge’s seat, an office he still holds today in an unprecedented fourth term.
On July 7, 1999, the "Herald" published its “Presidential Edition,” marking the visit of President Bill Clinton, who gave a speech to a welcoming crown during a very hot summer day on Hazard’s Main Street. 
“Pres. Clinton brings message of prosperity,” the headline read, and a special supplement to the paper contained photos and a detailed story on the president’s visit.
The 1990s closed with Rindahl still serving as the "Herald"’s publisher.
2000–2011.
The new millennium would bring with it a new set of challenges for an industry that for decades relied on a print product to keep the public informed. With the use of the Internet becoming much more widespread, other methods of news delivery became more and more popular. 
In 2000, the "Herald" continued its tradition of local news coverage, but in only a few years the Internet would push for one of the biggest changes the paper has undertaken.
"The Hazard Herald" launched the first version of its online presence in 2004. Since then, hazard-herald.com has remained an online presence for local news coverage and information, recently joining in on the popularity of social networking with pages on Facebook and Twitter.
Today, hazard-herald.com provides daily news updates, obituaries and other content, but at the turn of the century the "Herald" remained a print-only product.
Mike Rindahl remained as publisher until 2003, and after a few months without a publisher in name, parent company Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc. announced the promotion of Rodney Heath Wiley to the position on December 17, 2003. Wiley had served as the composing director at the "Herald"’s sister publication, the Floyd County Times, prior to his promotion to the Hazard property.
In 2004, the "Herald", along with sister publications in Harlan, Prestonsburg and Middlesboro, were sold to a newly formed company called Heartland Publications, which still owns the "Herald" today.
That same year, Wiley named former Times reporter Sheldon Compton the managing editor of the "Herald", a position he would hold for only a few months before departing the paper’s staff. Midge Bowling, who began her career in the composing room of the "Herald", continued to serve as advertising manager.
The first half of the decade included much controversy on the local scene, first with the local county school board and an investigation into the superintendent's contract, which ultimately turned up no wrongdoing. Another investigation saw a circuit judge indicted by a federal grand jury and subsequently convicted. 
Besides controversy, the "Herald" also chronicled growth in Perry County during that first half as well, from the extension of waterlines to outlying communities to the opening of the Daniel Boone Shopping Center along the Carl D. Perkins Parkway.
The second half of the decade began with Wiley remaining as publisher, but with no editor-in-name on staff. Cris Ritchie and Randy Walters, both staff reporters, made up the paper’s editorial staff at the time.
Much of the news coverage of the time dealt with the region’s ongoing problem with prescription drug abuse. With the inception of Operation UNITE, a federally funded drug task force formed in 2003, the fight against drug abuse continued making headlines throughout the decade, and continues today.
On March 8, 2006, Luke Keith, Jr., the former owner and operator of the Sentinel-Echo in London, was named publisher of the "Herald", while only a few months later Erica Slone took over as advertising manager.
In September of that year, Ritchie left the paper for a brief stint at WYMT-TV in Hazard before returning to the "Herald" in December to fill the open editor's position, a role in which he still serves today.
More controversy made the headlines in 2007, as two union strikes rocked the Hazard ARH, but it was other stories that had more lasting effects. Then state Senator Daniel Mongiardo became the first native of Perry County to hold statewide office as he ascended to his role as lt. governor’s.
The local community also lost big in 2007, with the passing of Dr. C. Vernon Cooper, Jr. and Charlie Hammonds, both important members of the community. The "Herald" staff also said goodbye to a longtime friend with the passing of Jean Craft, who had served in a variety of roles since the 1970s, including office manager. Craft died on March 10, 2007.
It was also in 2007 that Erica Slone left the "Herald" for a position at an Alabama newspaper, while Barbara Anderson was named advertising manager in Hazard.
In 2008, as the nation elected its first African American president and Hazard High School’s football team competed in the state championship, the issue of coal mining and its environmental effects again created a stir. A local pro-coal group called Coal Mining Our Future formed with Perry County Clerk Haven King as it director.
In 2008, Josh Byers, the publisher of the "Floyd County Times", was named publisher of the "Herald" as well, and continues to serve in that role today.
It was in 2010 that the "Herald" reported on the loss of three of the local community’s more well-known names, including longtime Mayor Bill Gorman, who died in October 2010. Ernest Sparkman, a name now synonymous with radio broadcasting in Perry County, died in January 2010 at the age of 84, and well-known land developer Roy Campbell was murdered in his Brownsfork home in November. His case remains unsolved to this day.
As for "The Hazard Herald", it remains a mainstay in the local community, continuing a tradition of a weekly print product that is now coupled with an ever-growing online presence. Some of the more traditional aspects of the paper’s history remain, such as the street vendors who brave the elements to sell papers on street corners in the city. Much, however, has also changed, and we expect much will continue to change as the "Herald" continues a tradition begun 100 years ago in this small but important town in Eastern Kentucky.

Afrocentric education

Afrocentric education is education designed to empower African people. A central premise behind it is that many Africans have been subjugated by limiting their awareness of themselves and indoctrinating them with ideas that work against them. To control a people's culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others. Like educational leaders of other cultures, proponents assert that what educates one group of people does not necessarily educate and empower another group—so they assert educational priorities distinctly for the "Africans" in a given context.
Philosophy.
Afrocentric education has, as one of its tenets, decolonizing the African mind. The central objective in decolonizing the African mind is to overthrow the authority that alien traditions may exercise. In order to achieve this, Eurocentric ideology must be dismantled from everyday African life. This is not to say that the African is to reject foreign tradition, but she or he is to deny its authoritative control in the culture of the African, and denounce allegiance to this authoritative control. Decolonizing the African mind seeks to mentally liberate Africans. Economic and political control can never be complete or effective without mental control. It is then clear that an Afrocentric education is essential based on the idea of mental liberation.
Education.
Education was understood to be a process of harnessing the inner potential, and thus it is imperative to equip the youth with an awareness of their identity. The term "miseducation" was coined by Dr. Carter G. Woodson to describe the process of systematically depriving African Americans of their knowledge of self. Dr. Woodson believed that miseducation was the root of the problems of the masses of the African American community and that if the masses of the African American community were given the correct knowledge and education from the beginning, they would not be in the situation that they find themselves in today. Dr. Woodson argues in his book, The Mis-Education of the Negro, that African Americans often valorize European culture to the detriment of their own culture.
The problem concerning formal education is seen by Afrocentrists to be that African students are taught to perceive the world through the eyes of another culture, and unconsciously learn to see themselves as an insignificant part of their world. An Afrocentric education does not necessarily wish to isolate Africans from a Eurocentric education system but wishes to assert the autonomy of Africans and encompass the cultural uniqueness of all learners.
A school based on African values, it is believed, would eliminate the patterns of rejection and alienation that engulf so many African American school children, especially males. The movement for African-centered education is based on the assumption that a school immersed in African traditions, rituals, values, and symbols will provide a learning environment that is more congruent with the lifestyles and values of African American families.
History.
This has been an active area of Afrocentrism for many decades.
19th and early 20th century.
Edward Wilmot Blyden, an Americo-Liberian educator and diplomat active in the pan-Africa movement, perceived a change in perception taking place among Europeans towards Africans in his 1908 book "African Life and Customs", which originated as a series of articles in the Sierra Leone "Weekly News". In it, he proposed that Africans were beginning to be seen simply as different and not as inferior, in part because of the work of English writers such as Mary Kingsley and Lady Lugard, who traveled and studied in Africa. Such an enlightened view was fundamental to refute prevailing ideas among Western peoples about African cultures and Africans.
Blyden used that standpoint to show how the traditional social, industrial, and economic life of Africans untouched by "either European or Asiatic influence", was different and complete in itself, with its own organic wholeness. In a letter responding to Blyden's original series of articles, Fante journalist and politician J.E. Casely Hayford commented, "It is easy to see the men and women who walked the banks of the Nile" passing him on the streets of Kumasi. Hayford suggested building a University to preserve African identity and instincts. In that university, the history chair would teach
The exchange of ideas between Blyden and Hayford embodied the fundamental concepts of Afrocentrism.
In the United States, during the early 20th century and the Harlem Renaissance, many writers and historians gathered in major cities, where they began to work on documenting achievements of Africans throughout history, and in United States and Western life. They began to set up institutions to support scholarly work in African-American history and literature, such as the American Negro Academy (now the Black Academy of Letters and Arts), founded in Washington, DC in 1874. Some men were self-taught; others rose through the academic system. Creative writers and artists claimed space for African-American perspectives.
Leaders included bibliophile Arthur Schomburg, who devoted his life to collecting literature, art, slave narratives, and other artifacts of the African diaspora. In 1911 with John Edward Bruce, he founded the Negro Society for Historical Research in Yonkers, New York. The value of Schomburg's personal collection was recognized, and it was purchased by the New York Public Library in 1926 with aid of a Carnegie Corporation grant. It became the basis of what is now called the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, based in Harlem, New York. Schomburg used the money from the sale of his collection for more travel and acquisition of materials.
Hubert Henry Harrison used his intellectual gifts in street lectures and political activism, influencing early generations of Black Socialists and Black Nationalists. Dr. Carter G. Woodson co-founded the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (as it is now called) in 1915, as well as the "The Journal of Negro History", so that scholars of black history could be supported and find venues for their work.
Among their topics, editors of publications such as NAACP's "The Crisis" and "Journal of Negro History" sought to include articles that countered the prevailing view that Sub-Saharan Africa had contributed little of value to human history that was not the result of incursions by Europeans and Arabs. Historians began to theorize that Ancient Egyptian civilization was the culmination of events arising from the origin of the human race in Africa. They investigated the history of Africa from that perspective.
In March 1925 Schomburg published an essay "The Negro Digs Up His Past" in the "Survey Graphic" in an issue devoted to Harlem's intellectual life. The article had widespread distribution and influence, as he detailed the achievements of people of African descent. Alain Locke included the essay in his collection "The New Negro".
Afrocentrists claimed "The Mis-Education of the Negro" (1933) by Carter G. Woodson, an African-American historian, as one of their foundational texts. Woodson critiqued education of African Americans as "mis-education" because he held that it denigrated the black while glorifying the white. For these early Afrocentrists, the goal was to break what they saw as a vicious cycle of the reproduction of black self-abnegation. In the words of "The Crisis" editor W. E. B. Du Bois, the world left African Americans with a "double consciousness," and a sense of "always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity."
In his early years, W. E. B. Du Bois, researched West African cultures and attempted to construct a pan-Africanist value system based on West African traditions. In the 1950s Du Bois envisioned and received funding from Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah to produce an "Encyclopedia Africana" to chronicle the history and cultures of Africa. Du Bois died before being able to complete his work. Some aspects of Du Bois's approach are evident in work by Cheikh Anta Diop in the 1950s and 1960s.
Du Bois inspired a number of authors, including Drusilla Dunjee Houston. After reading his work "The Negro" (1915), Houston embarked upon writing her "Wonderful Ethiopians of the Ancient Cushite Empire" (1926). The book was a compilation of evidence related to the historic origins of Cush and Ethiopia, and assessed their influences on Greece.
1960s and 1970s.
The 1960s and 1970s were times of social and political ferment. In the U.S. were born new forms of Black Nationalism, Black Power and Black Arts Movements, all driven to some degree by an identification with "Mother Africa." Afrocentric scholars and Black youth also challenged Eurocentric ideas in academia.
The work of Cheikh Anta Diop became very influential. In the following decades, histories related to Africa and the diaspora gradually incorporated a more African perspective. Since that time, Afrocentrists have increasingly seen African peoples as the makers and shapers of their own histories.
"You have all heard of the African Personality; of African democracy, of the African way to socialism, of negritude, and so on. They are all props we have fashioned at different times to help us get on our feet again. Once we are up we shan't need any of them any more. But for the moment it is in the nature of things that we may need to counter racism with what Jean-Paul Sartre has called an anti-racist racism, to announce not just that we are as good as the next man but that we are much better."
—Chinua Achebe, 1965
In this context, ethnocentric Afrocentrism was not intended to be essential or permanent, but was a consciously fashioned strategy of resistance to the Eurocentrism of the time. Afrocentric scholars adopted two approaches: a deconstructive rebuttal of what they called "the whole archive of European ideological racism" and a reconstructive act of writing new self-constructed histories.
At a 1974 UNESCO symposium in Cairo titled "The Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Decipherment of Meroitic Script", Cheikh Anta Diop brought together scholars of Egypt from around the world.
Key texts from this period include:
Some Afrocentric writers focused on study of indigenous African civilizations and peoples, to emphasize African history separate from European or Arab influence. Primary among them was Chancellor Williams, whose book "The Destruction of Black Civilization: Great Issues of a Race from 4500 B.C. to 2000 A.D." set out to determine a "purely African body of principles, value systems (and) philosophy of life".
1980s and 1990s.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Afrocentrism increasingly became seen as a tool for addressing social ills and a means of grounding community efforts toward self-determination and political and economic empowerment.
In his (1992) article "Eurocentrism vs. Afrocentrism", US anthropologist Linus A. Hoskins wrote:
The vital necessity for African people to use the weapons of education and history to extricate themselves from this psychological dependency complex/syndrome as a necessary precondition for liberation. [...] If African peoples (the global majority) were to become Afrocentric (Afrocentrized), ... that would spell the ineluctable end of European global power and dominance. This is indeed the fear of Europeans. ... Afrocentrism is a state of mind, a particular subconscious mind-set that is rooted in the ancestral heritage and communal value system.
American educator Jawanza Kunjufu made the case that hip hop culture, rather than being creative expression of the culture, was the root of many social ills. For some Afrocentrists, the contemporary problems of the ghetto stemmed not from race and class inequality, but rather from a failure to inculcate Black youth with Afrocentric values.
In the West and elsewhere, the European, in the midst of other peoples, has often propounded an exclusive view of reality; the exclusivity of this view creates a fundamental human crisis. In some cases, it has created cultures arrayed against each other or even against themselves. Afrocentricity’s response certainly is not to impose its own particularity as a universal, as Eurocentricity has often done. But hearing the voice of African American culture with all of its attendant parts is one way of creating a more sane society and one model for a more humane world. -Asante, M. K. (1988)
In 1997, US cultural historian Nathan Glazer described Afrocentricity as a form of multiculturalism. He wrote that its influence ranged from sensible proposals about inclusion of more African material in school curricula to what he called senseless claims about African primacy in all major technological achievements. Glazer argued that Afrocentricity had become more important due to the failure of mainstream society to assimilate all African Americans. Anger and frustration at their continuing separation gave black Americans the impetus to reject traditions that excluded them.
2000s.
Today, Afrocentricity takes many forms, including striving for a more multicultural and balanced approach to the study of history and sociology. Afrocentrists contend that race still exists as a social and political construct. They argue that for centuries in academia, Eurocentric ideas about history were dominant: ideas such as blacks having no civilizations, no written languages, no cultures, and no histories of any note before coming into contact with Europeans. Further, according to the views of some Afrocentrists, European history has commonly received more attention within the academic community than the history of sub-Saharan African cultures or those of the many Pacific Island peoples. Afrocentrists contend it is important to divorce the historical record from past racism. Molefi Kete Asante's book "Afrocentricity" (1988) argues that African-Americans should look to African cultures ""as a critical corrective to a displaced agency among Africans"." Some Afrocentrists believe that the burden of Afrocentricity is to define and develop African agency in the midst of the cultural wars debate. By doing so, Afrocentricity can support all forms of multiculturalism.
Afrocentrists argue that Afrocentricity is important for people of all ethnicities who want to understand African history and the African diaspora. For example, the Afrocentric method can be used to research African indigenous culture. Queeneth Mkabela writes in 2005 that the Afrocentric perspective provides new insights for understanding African indigenous culture, in a multicultural context. According to Mkabela and others, the Afrocentric method is a necessary part of complete scholarship and without it, the picture is incomplete, less accurate, and less objective.
Studies of African and African-diaspora cultures have shifted understanding and created a more positive acceptance of influence by African religious, linguistic and other traditions, both among scholars and the general public. For example religious movements such as Vodou are now less likely to be characterized as "mere superstition", but understood in terms of links to African traditions.
In recent years Africana Studies or Africology departments at many major universities have grown out of the Afrocentric "Black Studies" departments formed in the 1970s. Rather than focusing on black topics in the African diaspora (often exclusively African American topics), these reformed departments aim to expand the field to encompass all of the African diaspora. They also seek to better align themselves with other University departments and find continuity and compromise between the radical Afrocentricity of the past decades and the multicultural scholarship found in many fields today.
African Centered Leadership-Fellowship (ACL-F)
2000
Dr. Uhuru Hotep, co-director of the Kwame Ture Leadership Institute, established an ethnocentric approach to leadership specifically based on the four principles of restoration of sovereignty, Sankofa, Maat restoration, and Johari Sita installation.
Restoration of sovereignty is a concept that surrounds cultural, political and economic entities of society. Sovereignty is synyonmous with self-determination. In the tradition of a self-sufficient creation of communities, seshemet (leadership) was developed to restore the Moroon tradition of kilombo construction.
Sankofa is a leadership technique of Ghana that emphasizes living in the present to learn from the past. This concept requires its followers to learn about the contributions of their ancestral leaders and to continue with their struggles. It mandates that African centered leaders reconnect with their ancestors.
Maat restoration is a collaboration of the central themes of truth, justice, order, harmony, balance, reciprocity and propriety. which is based on the teachings of ancient Kemet. This concept is characterized by the restoring of public confidence and the promotion of psychological and fiscal prosperity among the leaders and their followers.
Johari Sita is a multifaceted Afrocentric approach to leadership-followership development. It can best be described as the processes, procedures and practices of ACL-F. This model of leadership is the foundation for nation-wide workshops called "Preparing African Youth for 21st Century Leadership and Service."
The internal loci of control for African centered leaders and followers are contrary to the political and financial dependency of followers of external loci of control of many mainstream middle class Black American leadership practices.

Hiera (mythology)

In Greek mythology, Hiera () is the wife of Telephus, the mythic founder of the city of Pergamum. She is depicted in the frieze on the interior of the Altar of Pergamum. 
During the Trojan War the Greeks attacked Pergamum, either because they mistook it for Troy, or because an alliance existed between Troy and Pergamum. Hiera was apparently an Amazon, and the Amazons united with the defenders of Pergamum to repel the attack. However, in the battle Hiera was killed by the Greek warrior Nireus. Telephus was so grief-stricken that he called a cease-fire to hold the funeral for Hiera, before restarting the battle and finally driving the invaders away. 
It is possible that the ancient city of Hierapolis (modern Pamukkale, Turkey) was named in her honor, though the name can also be read as just 'holy city'. She had by two sons by Telephus, Tarchon and Tyrsenus.

Caterham Racing

Caterham Racing is the practice of racing Caterham Seven-type sportscars.
History.
The Caterham Seven (or Caterham 7) is a small sports car produced by Caterham Cars in the United Kingdom. It is based on the Lotus Seven, a lightweight sports car sold in kit and pre-built form by Lotus Cars, from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. After Lotus ended production of the Lotus Seven, in 1972, Caterham bought the rights to the design, and today make both kits and fully assembled cars. 2007 marked the 50th year of production of the Lotus/Caterham 7.
The Lotus 7 was conceived by Colin Chapman as a car to be raced. Whilst still a prototype, in September 1957, it was raced at the Brighton Speed Trials and by the end of 1958 Graham Hill was winning races with the Coventry Climax-engined 'Super Seven' The car has had a strong racing history throughout its life under both Lotus and Caterham stewardship. Amongst the marques more famous races was victory in the Nelson Ledges 24-hour race in Ohio when, against a field including works teams from Honda and Mazda, a four-man team from Caterham (including both Jez Coates and Robert Nearn) won by seven laps (after 990 laps) in a modified Vauxhall HPC.
After dominating open class races for decades Caterham Super 7 Racing, a one-make championship for Caterhams, was begun in 1986. Caterham 7 races have since expanded to include club and competitive races in the United Kingdom, continental Europe, Canada, the United States and Asia.
The car was banned from racing in the USA in the 1960s, as being "Too fast to race" and again in the UK in the 1970s for the same reasons, which prompted Caterham Cars boss Graham Nearn to produce 'T' shirts with "Caterham Seven, the car that's "Too Fast to Race. ..". Both bans were later lifted. In 2002 an R400 won its class (and came 11th overall out of 200 starters) at the 24 Hours Nürburgring race by 10 laps, ahead of competition that included Porsche and BMW racecars, leading, once again, to a ban on entry in subsequent years.
Current Caterham Racing.
There are many Caterham Racing Championships across the world, the majority administered in some way by Caterham Cars. It is estimated that there are over 700 competitors in 20 Caterham championships across 11 countries, and many more that compete in sprint and hillclimb events.
The Caterham Motorsport Ladder.
The Caterham Motorsport Ladder is a progression through the various Caterham Cars championships, starting with the Caterham Academy, and moving through ultimately to their most prestigious European events. The championships which form the ladder are:
Caterham Academy.
In 1995 the Caterham Academy, a novices-only format, was introduced in the UK as the Caterham Scholarship. For £17,995 (2009 price), entrants get a modified Roadsport kit (a factory-built option is available for extra cost) with a sealed Ford Sigma engine engine and 5-speed gearbox. Having completed the ARDS (racing) licence qualification, the season then consists of a setup day, three speed events (sprints and hillclimbs), and four circuit races.
Since 2000, the popularity of the Academy has led to Caterham providing two parallel Academy championships (Group 1 & Group 2), each resulting in an Academy champion at the end of the year. Approximately 700 racing drivers have been created through the Caterham Academy.
Roadsport B.
Roadsport B is largely for drivers that have come through the previous season's Academy. Some minor modifications are permitted to the car, including fitting a rear anti-roll bar and sticky Avon CR500 tyres. Technical support is still provided by the factory, and professional team support is not permitted. RSB has 20-minute races at 7 or 8 'double-header' meetings over the course of the season, usually all in the UK. For 2009, RSB will be available exclusively to Sigma-engined cars.
Roadsport A.
Roadsport A cars are still ex-Academy cars, with no engine upgrades. However a number of performance upgrades such removing the windscreens and lights, widetrack front suspension and uprated dampers are allowed, as is professional team support. RSA races at the same events as RSB, but has longer 30-minute races.
Superlight R300.
The Superlight R300 is a new class for 2009, designed to bridge the gap between RSA and the existing Superlight R400 class. It is expected to be popular with experienced RSA racers wanting to move on to the next level in speed.
2009 Champion, Jon Walker - DPR Motorsport
Superlight R400.
The Superlight R400 series is Caterham Motorsport’s premier British championship. The R400 is a 220 bhp Cosworth powered dedicated race car with a Quaife six-speed sequential gearbox replacing the standard Caterham unit used in the R300. As with all series above Academy, it runs ons Avon CR500 tyres.
2009 Champion Dan Denis, Matt Blyth Racing
Superlight R500.

Caterham Graduates Racing Club.
Background.
The Caterham Graduates Championship was started in 1998 by competitors from the 1997 Caterham Scholarship. In its first two years, it was a multi-discipline series, with the rounds being made up of sprints, hillclimbs and circuit races, similar to the Caterham Scholarship format. The emphasis moved more and more towards circuit races, and from 2000-on the series has been entirely circuit races.
The Grads Club is independent of the Caterham Motorsport Ladder, and is run by its members. The series is one of the largest in the UK, if not the largest, with well over 100 registered competitors. The competitors come from a variety of backgrounds. A number have "graduated" from the novice Caterham Scholarship and Academy series, whilst many others have made it their first foray into motorsport.
Classes.
Current classes are:
Classic Graduate.
1600cc Ford or Vauxhall engined Caterham Sevens with a live axle, from the Caterham Scholarship or Academy 1997 - 2000. These cars are fully road legal and produce around 100 bhp.
Super Graduate.
1600cc Rover K-series Caterham Sevens with independent DeDion rear suspension from the Caterham Academy 2001 - 2008. These cars are fully road legal and produce around 125 bhp.
Mega Graduate.
Uprated 1600cc Rover K-series Caterham Sevens with independent (DeDion) rear suspension from the Caterham Academy 2001 - 2008. These cars are semi-road legal (no lights or windscreen) and with controlled modifications produce around 150 bhp.
Sigma Graduate.
Using the 1600cc Ford Sigma engined cars used in the Academy from 2008 onwards with around 120 hp. Screens are optional and normally removed but lights are required. The only other change from Academy specification (apart from tyres) is the optional rear anti-roll bar.
All classes run on Yokohama road legal tyres. Classic Graduates race on list 1A A539s, whilst Supers, Megas and Sigmas use the stickier list 1B A048R
The cars in the series are genuinely road-going, although Mega-Graduates spec is moving away from this with the deletion of lights, and indeed a few are driven to (and hopefully) from races. Many are used by drivers mid-week for transport to work and for shopping, needing no more than the covering up of competition numbers to make them road-legal. No changes from the standard specification are allowed, putting the emphasis firmly on driving ability rather than car development and set-up. Along with low consumable costs, this keeps the costs of running a car very much under control, making it one of the most cost-effective ways to go racing. The large grid sizes are a testament to this low-cost formula.
Affordability is a key ingredient to Caterham Graduates racing. Strict regulations allow only limited modifications and work on the sealed engines is limited to a single nominated engine builder.
Other Caterham Championships around the world.
There are a large number of championships around the world both exclusively for Caterham Seven cars, and in which Caterhams compete alongside other cars. Caterham Academies have been introduced in the Netherlands, Portugal, and other countries.

Sandvikselva

Sandvikselva, formerly known as Løxa, is a river in Bærum, Norway, originating at the intersection of the two rivers Lomma and Isielva at Wøyen. The river flows into the Oslo Fjord 4.5 km south at Sandvika, though the center of the city. At the mouth there are three bridges over the river.
There were formerly water mills for industry along the line, including at Franzefoss for Franzefoss Bruk. The river regularly floods, and landslides have occurred. There is a measuring station for water levels and pollution at Bjøregårdsvingen. 
Sandvikselva is the premier trout river of the Oslo Fjord, and a community of dedicated volunteers invest much time and energy to preserve the conditions for the fish to be able to travel up the river to spawn each autumn.

Canadian Pacific Railway in British Columbia

The Canadian Pacific Railway is a Canadian Class I Railroad that stretches from Montreal to Vancouver. The BC portion of the railway was constructed between 1881 and 1885, fulfilling a promise extended to British Columbia when it entered Confederation in 1871. For decades, it was the only practical means of long–distance passenger transport in Canada.
Background.
The Confederation League (which included such figures as Amor De Cosmos, John Robson, and Robert Beaven) led the chorus pressing for the colony to join Canada, which had been created out of three British North American colonies in 1867 (the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick). Several factors motivated this drive—fear of annexation by the United States, overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth, the need for government-funded services to support this population, and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush. With the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the Canadian Pacific Railway to British Columbia and to assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join Confederation on 20 July 1871. The borders of the province were not completely settled until 1903, however, when the province's territory shrank somewhat after the Alaska boundary dispute settled the vague boundary of the Alaska Panhandle.
Construction.
The Pacific Scandal.
Sir John A. Macdonald's government fell in 1872 due to corruption in railway contracts. Alexander Mackenzie succeeded Macdonald as Prime Minister and embarked on a very slow building process in Manitoba. At this time there was also a severe financial depression, due to the Credit Mobilier scandal and the building of the Union Pacific Railroad in the US. Also at this time, the government of Canada embarked on many surveys across the Rocky Mountains searching for the best route. Half a dozen routes were investigated, among them Pine Pass, Rocky Mountain Canyon, Yellowhead and Kootenay Crossing. These myriad surveys took time, effort and money—money which would have been better spent on just one or two surveys. 
Macdonald returned to power in 1878 and truly began to get on with the job of the railway. The government of Canada contracted with Andrew Onderdonk to build a railway two hundred miles from Port Moody on the Pacific tidewater to Savona's Ferry, some thirty miles west of modern Kamloops. Public Works Minister Sir Sandford Fleming had chosen the Fraser Canyon route with its fearsome Hell's Gate torrent, steep granite chasms, winding valleys and rockfalls. Other surveys had been conducted down Bute Inlet, Dean Channel, Howe Sound and Harrison Lake but were found wanting. Fleming favoured the Yellowhead Pass as the best route. At any rate the blasting and tunnelling through the tortuous Pacific Cascade Mountains would take half-a-dozen years, and the route could drive from Kamloops to Jasper after Onderdonk's crews had finished.
Canadian Pacific Railway.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Bill was approved by the House of Commons, and in February 1881 the company came into existence. It agreed to build the railway in exchange for $25,000,000 (approximately $625,000,000 in modern Canadian dollars) in credit from the Canadian government and a grant of of land. The government transferred to the new company those sections of the railway it had constructed. The government also defrayed the cost of surveying, and exempted the railway from property taxes for 20 years. The Montreal-based syndicate officially consisted of five men—George Stephen, James J. Hill, Duncan McIntyre, Richard B. Angus, and John Stewart Kennedy. Donald A. Smith and Norman Kittson were unofficial silent partners with a significant financial interest.
Chinese workers.
Due to a shortage of workers, Onderdonk contracted labour agents in Kowloon to supply thousands of Chinese coolies for the project. The province was outraged at the mass transfer of labour and "Asiatics", fearing that both would upset the white Anglo-Saxon classes in "British" Columbia. Macdonald ceded to Onderdonk, due to the savings in labour costs. BC at the time only had a population of two or three thousand Europeans—not nearly enough to build such a large project. Macdonald quipped that BC could either have Chinese workers and a railway, or no Chinese workers and no railway. Historians estimate he brought in several thousand Chinese from China and many thousands more from California. Chinese workers were kept on crews separate from the white workers and often given the most dangerous jobs, including tunnel-blasting using highly unstable nitroglycerin. Many Chinese laborers were killed in accidents or died of scurvy during the winter, though part of the blame for the scurvy deaths lay with the workers' reliance on rice as a staple. Unlike white workers, injured Chinese workers were not given access to the company hospital and were abandoned to the rest of the workers for help. Discrimination and racism led to fights between Chinese and white workers, including white foremen of Chinese crews. Chinese workers were generally seen by management as efficient, hardworking and well-behaved.
The Chinese crews worked year-round in the cliffs and forests, leveling grades. Navvies received between $1 and $2.50 per day but had to pay for their own food, clothing, transportation to the job site, mail and medical care. After two-and-a-half months of back-breaking labour, they could net as little as $16. Chinese navvies in British Columbia made only between $0.75 and $1.25 a day (not including expenses), leaving hardly anything to send home. They did the most dangerous construction jobs. The families of the Chinese who were killed received no compensation—not even notification of loss of life. Many of the men who survived did not have enough money to return to their families in China and spent years in lonely, sad and (often) poor conditions.
Michael Heney.
Onderdonk engaged Irishman Michael James Heney, a superior foreman. Heney saw the problem of the rivers, gorges, and cliffs and realized that Onderdonk would need extensive bridging. To solve this problem, Heney built a steam-powered sawmill at Haney to cut standardized timbers. Crews also cut bridge bents (framework reinforcements), so the advance crews only had to submit measurements to Heney and he would custom-build a woodwork for that mile marker of track. The prime Douglas Fir of the Fraser Valley provided ideal timber. Lumber for ties was also cut at Texas Creek, and timber was cut at the Chehalis river near Kilby. Other crews were engaged around the province cutting and squaring crossties by the million.
1885: the critical year.
The ongoing cost of construction crews, crossing mountains, rivers and the Canadian Shield completely undid construction estimates and the CPR was nearly bankrupt in 1885. To prevent financial ruin CPR crews stopped building in masonry and steel, opting for tree-pole construction with bridge trestles built from nearby trees. Snowsheds, easy routings and sidings were omitted to reduce costs. Only the intervention of Lord Revelstoke of Barings Bank of London with another loan gave the CPR enough financing to finish the job. The greatest disadvantage of the route was in Kicking Horse Pass. In the first west of the 1,625-metre(5,330 ft)-high summit, the Kicking Horse River drops 350 metres (1,150 ft). The steep drop would force the cash-strapped CPR to build a 7-km(4.5 mile)-long stretch of track with a very steep 4.5% gradient when it reached the pass in 1884. This was over four times the maximum gradient recommended for railways of this era; even modern railways rarely exceed a 2% gradient. However, this route was far more direct than one through the Yellowhead Pass and saved hours for both passengers and freight. This section of track was the Big Hill. Safety switches were installed at several points, the speed limit for descending trains was set at 10 km per hour (6 mph) and special locomotives were ordered. Despite these measures, several serious runaways still occurred. CPR officials insisted that this was a temporary expediency, but this state of affairs would last for 25 years until the completion of the Spiral Tunnels in the early 20th century.
Strike at Golden.
Money problems triggered a strike at a construction camp near Golden in late 1885. Work crews had not been paid for months, and downed their tools. The North-West Mounted Police and company foremen attempted to calm the situation. Promises were made by the company which ameliorated the stalemate, and the crews went back to work.
Last spike.
The North-West Rebellion in Saskatchewan was quickly put down with troops travelling over the CPR. Perhaps because the government was grateful for this service, it subsequently reorganized the CPR's debt and provided a further $5,000,000 loan—money which was desperately needed by the CPR. On November 7, 1885, the Last Spike was driven at Craigellachie, British Columbia, making good on the original promise. Four days earlier, the last spike of the Lake Superior section was driven just west of Jackfish, Ontario. While the railway was completed four years after the original 1881 deadline, it was completed more than five years ahead of the 1891 deadline issued by Macdonald in 1881.
Extension of the line from Port Moody.
After the completion of the through line to Montreal, Sir William Cornelius Van Horne looked at Port Moody and Burrard Inlet and decided to move the terminus to Gastown and False Creek. Land was secretly obtained from the provincial government and landowners to prevent speculation, and work crews extended the line 11 miles west to the City of Vancouver. Engine 374 pulled the first passenger train into Vancouver on May 23, 1887; it was a banner year for the city.
Canadian Pacific agents operated in many overseas locations. Immigrants were often sold a package that included passage on a CP ship, travel on a CP train, and land sold by the CP Railway priced at $2.50 an acre and up. Immigrants paid very little for a seven-day journey to the west. They rode in cars with sleeping facilities and a small kitchen at one end of each car. Children were not allowed off the train, lest they wander off and be left behind. The directors of the CPR knew that not only were they creating a nation, but also a long-term source of revenue for their company.
Since completion.
Founding of Vancouver.
Vancouver was founded in 1886 as an adjunct to the arrival of the railway. The CPR was given extensive lands in the Vancouver area—the West End, lands west of Cambie Street, False Creek and the Southlands area stretching to the Fraser River. Posh subdivisions were built, due to the railway's influence. The Drake Street Roundhouse was built on False Creek, and Yaletown emerged. The City of Vancouver was incorporated on 6 April 1886, the year the first transcontinental train arrived. The name (honouring George Vancouver) was chosen by CPR president William Van Horne, who arrived in Port Moody to establish the CPR terminus recommended by Henry John Cambie. A massive "slash burn" (clearing fire) broke out of control on 13 June 1886, razing the entire city. It was quickly rebuilt, and the Vancouver Fire Department was established that same year.
Enter the CPR Pacific Steamers.
The CPR chartered ocean steamers "Batavia", "Abyssinia" and "Parthia" to enter the China tea trade. The CPR then built their well-known Empress ships. The began liner service in 1891.
Profitability.
The completion of the line and extension of the steamers put the railway in the black. From this, it began a program of infrastructure upgrades; the temporary trestles were changed to stone and steel. Snowsheds were built, as were rail yards, spurs, coalsheds and watertowers. The CPR sought cargo for its trains—lumber from the Hastings mill, fish from Steveston, fruit from the Okanagan, minerals from the Kootenays and immigrants from Europe. With this in mind, the railway expanded with spurs to the Okanagan, the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway, and a southern link from Port Coquitlam to New Westminster and Eburne.
Various disasters.
While the CPR was doing well on the financial front, heavy slides in the Rogers Pass would often close the line in the month of March. Crews were dispatched to the area to shovel snow, which worked until 1910 when another slide came down on a work crew. Rains in 1894 washed out bridges and rail lines in a number of places. The line also had ongoing trouble with the Big Hill, including several runaway trains.
Turn of the century.
By the turn of the 20th century, the railway was a going concern and made its mark on the world stage. Major hotels were begun, such as the Empress Hotel in Victoria, the Second Hotel Vancouver, Glacier House, the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise. Heavier railway equipment was built and ordered to keep up with the increased tonnage, and with the heavier trains came heavier bridges. One ongoing problem was the onerous grade up the Kicking Horse Pass. The heavy trains needed batteries of engines to get over the Big Hill. From this the Spiral Tunnels evolved, and construction began to build the long tunnels under the mountains.
The Crow's Nest Pass.
The CP empire had driven south from Calgary in the 1890s to reach the coal mines of Lethbridge; also, a link was made to the US lines in Montana. From this, the CPR wanted to build a line to the rich coalfields of Fernie over the Rocky Mountains in BC. A line was built from Alberta across the Crow's Nest Pass to Fernie and Cranbrook, and the mountains became littered with colleries. By 1900, the CPR had purchased the smelter at Trail and sought to move Fernie coal around the Selkirk Mountains to Nelson and Trail. When the CPR bought the smelter, it also bought the large mining company of Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company and their many properties in the Kootenays.
The Canadian Pacific Railway built a line from Lethbridge, Alberta, to a lakehead near Nelson, British Columbia; it opened in 1897. This line was built to develop coal deposits in the Elk River valley and help to assert Canadian (and CPR) sovereignty in an area into which U.S. railroads were beginning to build. CPR sought and received construction funding from the federal government, subject to a freight-subsidy arrangement for farm exports from the prairies; this came to be called the "Crow's Nest Pass Agreement". The tough lakeshore section around the Creston Mountains (from Creston to Nelson) was not built until 1927. Barges and lake steamers connected the railway.
Crow Rate.
The Crow Rate or "Crow's Nest Freight Rate" was a subsidy offered to the Canadian Pacific Railway by the Canadian government. The subsidy was instituted by an 1897 agreement between the CPR and the federal government. The purpose of the subsidy was to enable the CPR to expand westward over the Canadian Rockies through the Crow’s Nest Pass, while reducing the transportation costs for farmers in the Canadian Prairies. In exchange for cash and perpetual title to the CPR over the lands which the railway would run, the CPR would reduce shipping rates for listed agricultural products "forever".
CP in the Kootenays.
The Columbia and Western Railway was a short-line, narrow-gauge railway running from the silver and gold mines at Red Mountain and Rossland down the hill to the smelter at Trail. It was bought by the CPR in 1898 for its charter; this gave it the authority to build westward to Grand Forks. Here it connected to the part of the original Kettle Valley Railway between Grand Forks and Midway which had also been purchased by the CPR. The Columbia and Western brought with it the smelter at Trail, which became the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company Limited (later Cominco Ltd). The CPR also purchased the Columbia and Kootenay Railway and Navigation Company, which had a charter to construct a railway from Nelson to Robson (Castlegar, BC). Another purchase was the charter for the BC Southern Railway, which authorized the construction of a railway from the Crow's Nest Pass to Nelson. This line was initially constructed as far as the south end of Kootenay Lake. The gap between there and Procter was not closed until around 1932.
The Arrow Lakes route was accessible from the north, by a rail connection with the Canadian Pacific Railway at Revelstoke, where the CPR crosses the Columbia River. The Arrow Lakes Route was also accessible from the south—at Northport, Washington, (also on the Columbia River) where there was a rail connection. The Columbia River crosses the border near Boundary, Washington, which is about 749 miles from the mouth of the Columbia.
The CPR also built rail lines to Sandon. The Nakusp and Slocan line went from Nakusp to Summit Lake, then down to Slocan Lake, past Rosebery, then up to Denver Canyon (New Denver). Then it drove up the hill along Carpenter Creek, to the mountainous mining town of Sandon. After the disastrous forest fire of 1911, the CPR bought the charred remains of the GN narrow gauge line Kaslo and Slocan Railway and rebuilt parts to standard gauge. The CPR then ran lake steamers and rail-car barges to link these disconnected lines over the lakes—from Kaslo to Nelson on Kootenay Lake; from Rosebery to Slocan City on Slocan Lake; and from Robson to Nakusp to Arrowhead (near Revelstoke) on the Arrow Lakes. The CPR attempted to build a connecting line from Lardeau, past Poplar Meadow—fifteen miles up the Lardeau River to Marblehead. Low traffic caused the line never to be finished to Trout Lake, Beaton and Arrowhead.
Building the Kettle Valley Railway.
The CPR desired to have a second railway line across BC to service the rich farm, timber and mining lands in the Kootenays. It also wanted to lessen the impact of its rival Great Northern, which had easy access to the area from low valleys in Washington state. Through a long series of purchases, political machinations, lobbying, and due to the appearance of the GN, the Kettle Valley Railway was constructed from 1910 to 1915. The Kettle Valley Railway began at Hope and transited the Coquihalla Mountains to Brookmere, Tulameen, Princeton, Summerland, Penticton, Beaverdell and Midway. An additional spur line from the junction at Brodie connected the line through Merritt, British Columbia to Spences Bridge, British Columbia on the CPR main line. The Kettle Valley Railway operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the CPR until it was absorbed by the CPR around 1937 as the Kettle Valley Division.
Lake steamers.
The CPR ran a fleet of lake steamers on the Arrow Lakes, Kootenay and Slocan Lakes. They also had palatial ships on Okanagan Lake.
Coastal service in BC.
BCCS was established when the CPR acquired the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company (and its large fleet of ships serving 72 ports along the coast of British Columbia, including Vancouver Island) in 1901. Service included the Vancouver-Victoria-Seattle Triangle Route, Gulf Islands, Powell River and a Vancouver-Alaska service. BCCS operated a fleet of 14 passenger ships made up of a number of Princess ships (pocket versions of the ocean-going Empress ships), a freighter, three tugs and five rail-car barges. Popular with tourists, the Princess ships were famous in their own right—especially the Princess Marguerite (II), which was the last coastal liner; it operated from 1949 until 1985. Three massive piers were built in Coal Harbour to service the boats—CPR Piers A, B and C, and D. B and C has since been converted to Canada Place Pier. Other impressive docks were built in Victoria and Nanaimo.
Silk trains.
Between the 1890s and the 1940s, the CPR transported raw silk cocoons from Vancouver (where they had been shipped from the Orient) to silk mills in New York and New Jersey. A silk train could carry several million dollars' worth of silk, and had its own armed guards. To avoid train robberies and minimize insurance costs, the silk trains traveled quickly and stopped only to change locomotives and crews (often done in under five minutes). The silk trains had right-of-way over all other trains; even passenger trains would be put in a siding to make the silk trains' trip faster.
Expansion.
The CPR embarked on facilities expansion during the Edwardian era. Large service yards were built at Port Coquitlam, Drake Street, Coal Harbour, and Cranbrook. Small feeder lines were built, such as the Marpole Line from Drake Street to Eburne and then to Steveston. A bridge was built southwards across the Fraser River at Mission, and a line was constructed to connect with the US Lines at Huntington (named for Collis P. Huntington, a US railway executive). The CP also built a hundred miles of rail down the Rocky Mountain trench from Golden to Creston, to more easily move heavy coal trains than over the winding and mountainous Kettle Valley Line. The coal was also needed on the main line for the steam engines. The Connaught Tunnel was built under Rogers Pass in 1913 to reduce grades there. Spur lines were built to various profitable mines around the province—to the Sullivan Mine at Kimberley, to copper mines at Phoenix, and south from Princeton to Allenby and Copper Mountain. A spur was built south of Penticton to Osoyoos. Large steel bridges were raised across the Fraser River at Hope and across the Columbia River at Revelstoke. The CPR embarked on a real estate expansion in Vancouver; it sold blocks of land to real-estate companies, which sold them for housing. The CPR also started the Shaughnessy Heights project of upscale estates, on a knoll at South Granville Street overlooking the city. Granville Street was established, and the finer residential suburb with curved streets, tree-lined avenues and strictly-controlled title deeds. The project did not sell as well as was hoped, due to the First World War and the Great Depression.
Competition.
The CPR held a 25-mile monopoly on train service in BC from 1886; no competitor could work nearer its main line than that distance. By 1910, there were other players who wished to repeat the success of the CPR—the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. Both lines arrived in BC but could not dislodge the CPR, which was firmly established in the southwest portion of the province. The CPR was given the Peace River Block in a land swap for acreage in the south; these lands turned out to be very rich in oil and gas.
First World War.
Its lines had been completed, and it had fleets of trains and ships; men, ships and machines were loaned to the war effort. Bridges and rail installations were guarded by Canadian troops. The CPR provided essential service moving men, food, and guns for the war. Railway shops were converted to shell factories.
Powerful engines.
The Selkirk locomotives were 36 steam locomotives of the 2-10-4 wheel arrangement built for the Canadian Pacific Railway by Montreal Locomotive Works in Montreal. The first of these large engines with 2-10-4 wheel arrangement were built in July 1929. A total of twenty were constructed before the end of the year, bearing numbers 5900 to 5919. The Canadian Pacific Railway's classification was T1a. These locomotives weighed 375 short tons (340 t) fully loaded. They were the largest and most powerful non-articulated locomotives in the British Empire. The CPR also put on a crack train in the 1920s—the Trans-Canada Limited. it was popular with Americans, as it was fast and it served alcohol (then illegal in the US).
Great Depression.
The Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1939, hit many companies heavily. While the CPR was affected, it was not crippled to the extent of its rival CNR because it (unlike the CNR) was debt-free. The CPR continued building the tunnel under Dunsmuir Street in Vancouver, joining its passenger station at Granville with the Drake Street yards and separating freight trains and streetcar lines. The CPR scaled back on some of its passenger and freight services, and stopped issuing dividends to its shareholders after 1932. One highlight of the 1930s (both for the railway and for Canada) was the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to Canada in 1939—the first time that the reigning monarch had visited the country in a Royal Tour. The CPR and the CNR shared the honours of pulling the royal train across the country, with the CPR undertaking the westbound journey from Quebec City to Vancouver. The CPR put semi-streamlined engines (among them Royal Hudson engine 2850) to the task of pulling the royal train. 
Legacy.
For those living outside British Columbia, it is difficult to convey the extent that the CPR empire covered BC. The railroad changed the province; it owned (and dictated to) a large section of it. The CPR's empire became part of BC—from the faux-Pict-Gothic-Palaces of its hotels, to its Tuscan-red cars and engines; from the CPR owning the center of town, to the CPR bloc establishing timber and mineral interests. The clapboard section houses and water towers and rusty rails of spurs, the thousands of wooden wheat boxcars sitting at sidings with the arcing, powerful script announcing "Canadian Pacific Railway"—all left an imprint.
In 1952, the CPR became the first North American railroad to introduce intermodal or "piggyback" freight service, where truck trailers are carried on flatcars. Containers later replaced most piggyback service. Beginning in the 1960s, the railroad started to discontinue much of its passenger service (particularly on its branch lines). Passenger service ended on its line through southern British Columbia and Crow's Nest Pass in January 1964. The Dominion was dropped in January 1966. On October 29, 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to Via Rail, a new federal Crown corporation now responsible for intercity passenger services in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presided over major cuts in Via Rail service on January 15, 1990. This ended service by the "Canadian" over CPR rails, and the train was rerouted on the former "Super Continental" route via Canadian National without a change in name. Where both trains had been daily prior to the January 15, 1990 cuts, the surviving "Canadian" was (and is) a thrice-weekly operation.
The CPR was in a powerful position during the First World War.
Canadian Pacific Railway currently operates three commuter services under contract. The West Coast Express comprises ten daily trains running into downtown Vancouver on behalf of TransLink, a regional transit authority. CNCP was created as a joint venture between Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway in 1967, replacing the different networks used by the two companies. CN Telegraph interchanged traffic with the Postal Telegraph Cable Company in the US, while CPR Telegraphs networked with Western Union. The two networks—former rivals—had been cooperating increasingly since the 1930s. By 1980, CNCP was no longer a telegraph company and emerged as an early telecom company. A 40% stake was acquired by Rogers Communications in 1984, and CP acquired CN's stake. The network was dissolved in 1988, and Rogers renamed the company Unitel Communications Incorporated in 1989.
Other holdings.
With the empire came timber, oil, gas, coal, airlines, and real estate. Much of the postwar holdings were in these fields, and the railroad moved into bulk commodities—wheat, potash, coal and sulphur. By the 1970s, the advent of jet aircraft and national highways finished the passenger business.
In the 1980s and '90s the railway continued with traffic expansion.
It double tracked most of its mainline, where the mountains and valleys let it.
A large tunnelling project under Mount MacDonald tunnel in Rogers Pass lowered the height the trains had to ascend to, and many rivetted bridges were replaced with
heavier welded bridges. The Vancouver Intermodal Yard in Pitt Meadows opened in
1996.

Max Wünsche

Max Wünsche (20 April 1914 — 17 April 1995) was a SS-"Standartenführer" (colonel) in the "Waffen-SS" during World War II who was awarded the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves.
Early life.
Max Wünsche was born on 20 April 1914 in Kittlitz. He went to school in Bautzen and later attended Mercantile school. He had an interest in agriculture, joining the agricultural union in 1928 and was for a short time employed as an estate manager.
In November 1932 Wünsche joined the "Hitlerjugend" (Hitler Youth), and in July 1933 he joined the SS where he attended the NCO training course at Jüterbog. Wünsche was selected to be an officer and attended "SS-Junkerschule" at Bad Tölz. He graduated in 1936 and was promoted to "Untersturmführer" (second lieutenant) in April. Wünsche was then posted to the "Leibstandarte" as a platoon leader in the 9th Company.
In October 1938, he was assigned to the "Begleitkommando des Führers" (a bodyguard unit of SS soldiers protecting the life of Adolf Hitler), as an Orderly Officer.
World War II.
In January 1940 he returned to the "Leibstandarte", as a platoon commander in the 15th Motor Cycle Company under the command of Kurt Meyer, for the invasion of the Netherlands and the Battle of France.
In December 1940 he was made the Adjutant to Sepp Dietrich where he stayed during the invasion of the Balkans, (Operation Marita) and the invasion of Russia, (Operation Barbarossa).
The LSSAH was attached to Army Group South, for Operation Barbarossa and Wünsche would carry out reconnaissance flights in a Fieseler Storch flying over the Russian positions.
One flight on the 31 July, contributed to the capture of Novoarkhangelsk, which closed the Uman pocket, trapping the encircled Russian Divisions.
"Sturmgeschütz" Battalion.
In February 1942 Wünsche was given the command of the LSSAH "Sturmgeschütz" (Assault Gun) Battalion, and was involved in stopping numerous Soviet Army attempts to break through the German lines.
In March his battalion was the Corps reserve at the Mius bridgehead and again prevented a Russian breakthrough. On 1 June Wünsche returned to Germany to study at the Staff College, where he successfully completed the General Staff training course and was promoted to "Sturmbannführer" (major).
In September 1942 he returned to the LSSAH and resumed command of the "Sturmgeschütz" Battalion until October when he was given command of the I/Battalion, SS Panzer Regiment 1 LSSAH which at the time was in the process of forming.
Kharkov.
His new battalion's first action was at Kharkov, fighting in blizzard conditions, with temperatures below freezing, they fought a number of battles which ended on 9 February, when they halted the Red Army advance and held the town of Merefa, at the same time inflicting heavy losses on the Russians.
On 10 February they went on the attack in an attempt to relieve the encircled 1st SS Reconnaissance Battalion LSSAH still commanded by his old commander, Kurt Meyer.
On 13 February Wünsche and his battalion succeeded in breaking through the lines to Meyer's beleaguered troops, saving them from destruction. Together the two battalions formed a "Kampfgruppe" (battle group) and continued the attack, defeating the Russian VI Guards Cavalry Corps by 15 February, the same day that Kharkov was abandoned by the Russians. For these actions Wünsche was awarded the German Cross in Gold.
On 25 February Wünsche's "Kampfgruppe" located an enemy force approaching the Division's southern flank. Acting on his own, Wünsche carried out an attack encircling the Soviets at Jeremejwka, destroying 52 heavy guns and causing over 900 casualties for the Russians. For this action he was awarded the Knight's Cross on the 28 February 1943.
"Hitlerjugend" Division.
In June 1943, "Sturmbannführer" Wünsche was ordered to transfer to a new division forming in France, which later became the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend (12th SS Panzer Division Hitler Youth), and take command of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment.
On 6 June 1944, the Allies landed in Normandy (Operation Overlord) on D Day and the 12th SS Panzer Division "Hitlerjugend" was committed to action on 7 June. In the following battles Wünsche's Regiment was credited with the destruction of 219 tanks up to the beginning of July, which gained Wünsche the award of the Oakleaves to his Knight's Cross.
The 12th SS Panzer was later trapped in what became known as the Falaise pocket, on the night of 20 August, Wünsche, his adjutant SS-"Hauptsturmführer" Isecke, SS-"Untersturmführer" Fritz Freitag and a wounded medical officer, escaped out of the pocket on foot. During the escape Wünsche was wounded in the calf and the doctor was captured. On 24 August, Isecke was captured, followed a short time later by the capture of Wünsche and Freitag.
Wünsche spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of war in camp 165 at Caithness, Scotland which was a special camp for high-ranking German officers.
Post war.
He was released in 1948 and returned to Germany.
He married, Ingeborg, had five sons and became a manager of an industrial plant in Wuppertal, until his retirement in 1980. He died a few days short of his 81st birthday, on 17 April 1995.

Radiofabrik

Radiofabrik is Salzburg’s community radio. It is an independent, non-commercial, non-profit radio station in Salzburg, Austria.
History.
Some of the founders, for example "Wolfgang Hirner" (who became CEO of the Radiofabrik later on) of Radiofabrik were broadcasting illegal pirate radio already in 1992. The programme was called «Radio Bongo 500».
Radiofabrik was the second Austrian community Radio, which started broadcasting immediately after the breakup of the radio broadcasting monopoly (Radio Helsinki at Graz, already started in 1995). In the beginning Radiofabrik had a five-hour broadcast-slot at the commercial radio station «Radio Arabella».
The daily broadcasting service started in January 2002, in alliance with the «Objektwerbung GmbH». After «Objektwerbung GmbH» faced financial turbulences, it retired from the broadcasting alliance in October 2003. By that time Radiofabrik received the full broadcasting licence.
Nowadays more than 280 volunteers create a twenty-four-seven radio programme, which is broadcast via the frequences 107,5 MHz and 97,3 MHz and via cable 98,6 MHz.
In the early days of Radiofabrik programme was produced in a container-studio. In 2005 the broadcast station moved into the «ARGE-Kultur Salzburg», the largest autonomic cultural centre of Western Austria, where professional infrastructure and equipment (office, studio, production rooms and workshop rooms) is available.
Programme and concept.
As a non-commercial, independent Community Radio Radiofabrik is intended for everyone, individuals and groups, especially for those, who tend to be underrepresented in both private and public media. Therefore there are programmes produced by and for people senior 50, a special programme produced by youth for people under 18, and also programmes in more than 10 different languages. Radiofabrik is the broadcasting service with the largest diversity of opinion in Salzburg.
Everyone who wants to create his own radio programme can become a community member and has to pass a workshop, in which media law, technical skills and basic journalistic skills are taught.
The person in charge of his own programme is free to choose  topic and content of his or her broadcast. There is definitely no space for programmes with racist, sexist, pro-violent or anti-democratic content as well as religious propaganda.
The journalist "Georg Wimmer", who has already won several journalistic awards, is responsible for the coordination of the programme. Georg Wimmer is on paternity leave since the end of 2008. In January 2009 project manager "Eva Schmidhuber" took on the programme administration.
Organisation.
The organization of Radiofabrik is based on two pillars: The „Verein Freier Rundfunk Salzburg“ is a registered association, in which all programme creators and supporters are members on institutional level. The association is responsible for the broadcasting service. The association owns a corporation in charge of the infrastructure (Sendeanlagen GesmbH), who also holds the broadcasting licence. 
The board of management consists of cultural scientist "Elke Zobl" (chairwoman of the association),  communication scientist "Alois Pluschkowitz", journalist "Michaela Gründler" (editor-in-chief of Street newspaper Apropos) and Anton Prlic (journalist of newspaper Salzburger Nachrichten) and management-consultant "Wolfgang Stöger".
Until 2007 Radiofabrik was managed by founder "Wolfgang Hirner". Adult educator "Andreas Wagner" was CEO from 2007 forward. In March 2008 media artist and media manager "Alf Altendorf" became CEO of Radiofabrik.
Project work.
Radiofabrik's local connection to NGOs and cultural sites in Salzburg is as vital for the programme of Radiofabrik as the orientation towards the European Union, which culminates in participating in many projects initiated by the EU. Radiofabrik shares its programs via online-platforms of Community Radios in Austria and Germany.
The significance of activities in the field of media-related education has increased. One example is the Interreg-IIIA-Project “EuRegio Medienzentrum”, where the “Aktion Film Salzburg” and the District Office of Traunstein are involved.
Technic.
Radiofabrik develops hard- and software for the editorial board of radio stations.
2005 IT-engineer "Hermann Huber" presented the Radio Automation Software YARM (Yet Another Radio Manager) at the Ars Electronica. Many Austrian community radios are now using YARM.
Production director, musician and innovater "Marcus Diess" created the signal monitoring system “Signal Watchdog”, which checks functioning of the Radiofabrik transmitters and immediately reports technical breakdowns via SMS. A sound editing software for blind editors (“Studioguard”) is under way.
Partnerships.
Radiofabrik 107,5 is a member of the "Association of Community Radios in Austria" (Verband Freier Radios Österreich – VFRÖ) and of the umbrella organization of Salzburg's cultural sites (Dachverband Salzburger Kulturstätten). The association is founder and holds a 24% share of the community television FS1.

Quotes.
"Each image is made with reverence for the subject. I want a person to feel at ease with me so that they remain themselves and are unchanged by a new or foreign element such as a stranger (myself) or a camera. In order for me to photograph a person in the unaffected environment of self there must be a trust between us. Without this, a stirring image cannot be created."

United States presidential election in New Jersey, 2008

The 2008 United States presidential election in New Jersey took place on November 4, 2008 throughout all 50 states and D.C., which was part of the 2008 United States presidential election. Voters chose 15 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
New Jersey was won by Democratic nominee Barack Obama with a 15.53% margin of victory. Prior to the election, all 17 news organizations considered this a state Obama would win, or otherwise considered as a safe blue state. No fundraising money was spent by either campaign, as the state has trended towards the Democratic Party in recent years. A highly affluent and predominantly urban state with an ethnically diverse population, New Jersey has become a reliably blue state, and this was evident again when Democrat Barack Obama comfortably won the state's 15 electoral votes with 57.14% of the vote.
Democratic primary.
The Democratic primary took place February 5, 2008, also known as Super Tuesday. Hillary Clinton won this primary.
Republican primary.
The Republican primary took place on February 5, 2008, with 52 national delegates.
Predictions.
There were 17 news organizations who made state by state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day:
Polling.
Pre-election polling was tight early on. However since October 12, Obama won each poll with a double digit margin of victory and with at least 52%. McCain didn't reach over 42% in that stretch. The final 3 polls found Obama leading with 55% to 39%.
Fundraising.
John McCain raised a total of $4,761,251 in the state. Barack Obama raised $13,624,081.
Advertising and visits.
Neither candidate spent anything here. The Republican ticket visited the state twice. Obama visited the state once.
Analysis.
New Jersey was once one of the most reliably Republican states in the Northeast. From 1948 to 1988, it voted Republican in all but two elections: John F. Kennedy in his narrow victory over Richard Nixon in 1960, and Lyndon Johnson's 44-state landslide of 1964. However, the brand of Republicanism practiced in New Jersey has historically been a moderate one. As the national party tilted more to the right, the state's voters became more friendly to Democrats. The state narrowly went for Bill Clinton in 1992 and has voted Democratic in every election since then. In all but one election since 1996, the Democrats have carried it by double digits. While Republicans remain competitive at the state and local level, at the presidential level New Jersey is now reckoned as part of the solid bloc of blue states in the Northeast.
Democrats have several structural advantages in New Jersey during presidential elections. The northeastern portion, including Newark, Jersey City, Elizabeth and Paterson, contains more than half the state's population and is heavily Democratic. The southwestern portion, including Camden and Cherry Hill, is also heavily Democratic. These regions have a total of over two million voters between them, making it extremely difficult for a Republican to carry the state. For instance, in 2004 George W. Bush held John Kerry to only a seven-point margin of victory, but was completely shut out in the northeast and southwest. Additionally, the state is split almost down the middle between the largest and fourth-largest markets in the country, New York City and Philadelphia. As a result, statewide races often feature some of the most expensive advertising budgets in the country.
In 2008, unlike in 2004, New Jersey was called for Obama almost as soon as the polls closed. Obama dominated the urban areas of the state, winning Essex County by over 50%, Hudson County by 47%, Camden and Mercer counties by 35%. Obama also won Somerset County, which had voted Republican in every election from 1968 to 2004. Most of the southern portion of the state voted Democratic.
McCain won most of Northwestern New Jersey, winning in Republican strongholds like Morris County and Sussex County (which McCain won by 21%). McCain also won most of the Jersey Shore counties.
At the same time, incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg was reelected over Republican Dick Zimmer by a 14.08-percent margin of victory. Lautenberg received 56.03% of the total vote while Zimmer took in 41.95%. Democrats also picked up a vacant U.S. House seat in New Jersey's 3rd congressional district that was previously held by a Republican; Democrat John Adler defeated Republican Chris Myers by a 3.30-percent margin of victory. Adler received 51.65% of the vote while Myers took in 48.35%.
Results.
By congressional district.
Barack Obama carried 10 of the state’s 13 congressional districts in New Jersey, including two districts held by Republicans.
Electors.
Technically the voters of NJ cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. NJ is allocated 15 electors because it has 13 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 15 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 15 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.
The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.
The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 15 were pledged to Barack Obama and Joe Biden:

The Canon de 12 Gribeauval was a French field artillery 12-pounder cannon which was part of the Gribeauval system. The system of Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval is said to mimic a concept pioneered by Justin Amedee Ethan de Musteve as early as 1765, who advocated altered gun-carriages to improve maneuverability.
The Gribeauval system, and the Canon de 12, was first used for major operations in the American Revolutionary War, in General Rochambeau's French expeditionary corps, from 1780 to late 1782, and especially at Yorktown in 1781. It was used extensively during the wars following the French Revolution and in the Napoleonic wars.
The Canon de 12 Gribeauval was manned by a crew of 15 and drawn by 6 horses.

Old English Gospel of Nicodemus

The Old English Gospel of Nicodemus is an Old English prose translation of the Latin "Gospel of Nicodemus". The "Old English Gospel of Nicodemus" is preserved in two manuscripts (the Cambridge University manuscript and the Cotton Vitelius A. 15 manuscript in the British Museum), both dating from the 11th century AD. In comparison to the Latin edition from which they are based, the manuscripts contain both minor and major differences, including various omissions and addition of numerous words, clauses, and sentences.
The "Old English Gospel of Nicodemus" contains "a sex-changed version of the grammatically masculine but otherwise ambiguous figure Inferus" referred to as "Seo hell", who engages in flyting with Satan, and orders him to leave "her" dwelling (Old English "ut of mynre onwununge"), and states that "her vivid personification in a dramatically excellent scene suggests that her gender is more than grammatical, and invites comparison with the Old Norse underworld goddess Hel and the Frau Holle of German folklore, to say nothing of underworld goddesses in other cultures." Bell says that "the possibility that these genders "are" merely grammatical is strengthened by the fact that an Old Norse version of Nicodemus, possibly translated under English influence, personifies Hell in the neuter (Old Norse "þat helviti")". 
Bell says that "to complicate the picture still further, personification itself is sporadic in the tradition" and that "in some redactions of the Latin and Old Norse Nicodemus, Hell's speaking part is taken by various loosely identified groups of denizens of the underworld," adding that Hell only appears additionally personified in the latest and most fragmentary of the four surviving Old Norse manuscripts of "The Gospel of Nicodemus".

Since its start in 1993, Apex Silver Mines Ltd. had become an exploration and development company and producer of silver, zinc and lead. 
On January 12, 2009, Apex Silver and its wholly owned subsidiary, ASMC, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on March 4, 2009. In connection with Apex' emergence from bankruptcy as a newly formed Delaware corporation named Golden Minerals Company, Apex sold their 65% interest in the San Cristóbal mine to Sumitomo but continue to operate the San Cristóbal mine. Golden Minerals also continue to own and explore their broad portfolio of exploration properties. Golden Minerals emerged from Apex Chapter 11 on March 24, 2009.
Under the Plan, all of the assets of Apex Silver, other than a small cash reserve for the payment of liquidation expenses, were transferred to Golden Minerals Company, a Delaware corporation that is Apex Silver’s successor, who emerged from Chapter 11 on March 24, 2009. Apex Silver was being liquidated in accordance with Cayman Islands law. Golden Minerals is virtually the same company as Apex, but without being the owner of San Cristóbal and without the debt. Golden Minerals resides in Golden, Colorado. Golden Minerals owns and controls a large number of exploration properties located primarily in the high potential mining districts in Latin America, including the feasibility stage El Quevar Project in northern Argentina.

Canon de 8 Gribeauval

The Canon de 8 Gribeauval was a French cannon and part of the Gribeauval system developed by Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. It was part of the field artillery.
The canon de 8 Gribeauval was used extensively during the wars following the French Revolution, as well as the Napoleonic wars. However, its first major operational use was even earlier, during the American Revolutionary War, in General Rochambeau's French expeditionary corps, from 1780 to late 1782, and especially at Yorktown in 1781.
The Canon de 8 Gribeauval was manned by 13 crews and drawn by 4 horses.

Fairy Cottage Halt

Fairy Cottage is an intermediate stopping place on the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man on the outskirts of the village of Laxey.
Location.
The stop is situated on the coast of Laxey Bay. It is only 500 yards from South Cape Halt, and this is the shortest distance between two main stations on the line. Access to the station is gained from the roadside behind a small local filling station and the halt caters almost exclusively for localised traffic.
Unusual usage.
In 1998 as part of the year-long Steam 125 event on the island marking the milestone anniversary of the Isle of Man Railway this tranquil setting served as the terminating point for steam locomotive No. 1 Sutherland" of 1873 which operated a number of special workings throughout the summer season to commemorate the birthday. There was some historical precedent for this, as the railway loaned out locomotives for use in conjunction with the construction of the electric line between 1893 and 1899.
Facilities.
Today, the halt sees little traffic but remains complete with its corrugated iron shelter.

Distributing artery

Distributing arteries (or muscular arteries) are medium-sized arteries that draw blood from an elastic artery and branch into "resistance vessels" including small arteries and arterioles. In contrast to the mechanism elastic arteries use to store energy generated by the heart's contraction, distributing arteries contain layers of smooth muscle.
Under the microscope distributing arteries can be identified by their clearly defined internal elastic lamina. In constricted vessels the elastic lamina of distributing arteries appears thick and kinky. The elastic lamina is best visualized using Verhoeff's stain, but can be easily detected in specimens stained using other techniques as a well-defined negative staining region.
Examples of distributing arteries include the radial artery and the splenic artery.

Agnieszka Pilchowa

Agnieszka Pilchowa pseudonym Agni P., one of the most famous Polish clairvoyants, bioenergotherapeutist and herbalist, was born on December 16, 1888 in village of Zarubek near Ostrava, present-day Czech Republic and died in 1944 in Ravensbrück, Nazi Germany, present-day Germany. She was ethnically Polish, although her family spoke Czech at home and she went to a Czech-language school. Her ability to see events before they happened was observed in many different places and under many different circumstances.
Early life.
Her supernatural abilities were visible from early years. As a child, she frequently broke into unusual condition, in which she saw exotic places, faraway countries and never-before seen people. She was then in a somnolence and did not react to external impulses. Her siblings would stop playing with her and Pilchowa withdrew into herself, gladly spending her time outside. As she later wrote:
"I had been born a clairvoyant. Whenever I am supposed to look into the world of the spirit, I do not need to fall into a trance. I do not need to use any medications; at first, I had to close my eyes. Now, I do not even have to do this".
When Pilchowa was a child, her mother remarried. The stepfather hated her so much that he would order the girl to do the heaviest chores on the family farm. She was always obedient and humble; as a child, she wanted to become a nun. Pilchowa would often find herself near a local convent, but at the age of 18, she changed her mind and joined the Spiritist Society of Cieszyn Silesia. However, other members of the Society, seeing the easiness with which she managed to get into a trance, came to the conclusion that Pilchowa was a cheater. After several heated arguments, the young woman left the organization.
Life in the interbellum.
In her late teens, Pilchowa married a local man. The post-World War I political situation made her life complicated. As an ethnic Pole, she was forced by the authorities of Czechoslovakia to leave her village and move to the Second Polish Republic. Her property was confiscated. Furthermore, in late 1910s she divorced her husband, citing rape as one of the reasons. 
Pilchowa settled in the town of Wisła, but in 1919 she returned to Czechoslovakia and went to Prague, where she took part in a series of scientific experiments at the University of Prague. Her powers of precognition, ability to see events before they happened, was officially confirmed. President Tomas Masaryk and his daughter Alicia were so impressed with her, that he asked her to stay in Prague and work for him, but the clairvoyant refused and returned to Wisła. 
Together with a new husband Jan and their two children, Agnieszka settled in a house in Wisła. She claimed that it was her guardian angel that had told her to live in this town. Also, the angel found her a spot on a hill in Wisła, where in 1931 the Pilch family completed a spacious villa called “Sfinks” (Sphinx). The name was a gesture towards Julian Ochorowicz, who lived nearby. The house also was the main office of the "Hejnal Spiritual Knowledge" monthly, where several people came asking for advice. After World War II it was turned into a popular rest-house. 
Moving to Poland was not easy for Pilchowa, who spoke limited Polish and had little knowledge of the Polish culture. As those who knew her later recalled, even after several years she spoke "a weird, outdated Polish, based on the 19th century authors, such as Andrzej Towianski".
In the 1920s Pilchowa became famous across southwestern Poland. She was not only a clairvoyant, but also a herbalist and a healer. She would prescribe herbs and diet to her patients, frequently using her paranormal skills to look into patients’ past events. She liked to sing religious songs and in her diary, Pilchowa wrote that while examining patients, she physically felt their pain. Her patients came mostly from Upper Silesia, Zaolzie and Podhale. Among the people she treated there were Michal Grazynski, voivode of the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship as well as President Ignacy Mościcki and Józef Piłsudski. "Agnes" (or "Agni P."), as she came to be known, shared her visions with Piłsudski; she also was invited to Belweder several times. 
In the 1930s, Pilchowa became famous across Poland. Her name was frequently mentioned on Polish Radio, mostly due to the broadcasts and articles of Zofia Kossak-Szczucka, who lived in the nearby village of Górki Wielkie. Pilchowa’s prophecies were widely known and discussed, with the most famous one, the Tegoborze Prophecy, published on March 27, 1939 in Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny daily. The publisher claimed that the Tegoborze Prophecy came from September 23, 1893, but Polish journalist and composer Stanisław Hadyna in his book "Through the windows of time" (Polish title: "Przez okna czasu") named Pilchowa as the author. The prophecy, whose author foresaw the outbreak of World War I and II:
In twenty years the will come dozens of time,
When the firm will pour forth from the sky.
Then meet Wernyhora songs,
The whole world is chockin with blood. 
When the black eagle sign of the cross filthy,
The wings spread across a sinister,
The two countries will fall, which no one save,
Strength is still against the law.
But the black eagle will come to crossroads;
When you turn your eyes to the east,
Teutonic spreading their customs,
With a broken wing back.
as well as the Polish Pope:
The three rivers of the world will give three crowns
Anointed from Kraków,
Four on the outskirts of the allied parties
Vow to supply his words.
was a sensation, mentioned multiple times in several sources as well as movies, such as Leonard Buczkowski’s film "Forbidden songs" (1946).
World War II and death.
Pilchowa’s numerous activities were terminated in September 1939, after joint Nazi and Soviet attack on Poland. Her prophecies became influenced by the horrific wartime reality and her visions were misunderstood by many, since they were regarded as too extravagant. In one session, she accurately foresaw outbreak of the war, also talked about Hitler’s attack on the Soviet Union. Since she mentioned it in late 1939 or early 1940, when the two powers were allied (see: Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), those present protested. In response, Pilchowa said: "I am just describing what I see".
During the same session, she saw a group of soldiers at the Brandenburg Gate, then a topographic map with miniature American and Japanese flags. Stanisław Hadyna, a witness of the session, asked then: "What are you talking about? Are you saying that the Japanese-American war will complete the Polish-German war? This is absurd". Pilchowa did not answer, and kept on talking: "I do not understand what it is. I see something terrible. It is a giant mushroom, made of clouds, which is growing in the skies. Where is it? What is it?" Then she opened her eyes widely and said that it was impossible: "It will result in the death of the planet", she added.
In another 1940 vision, Pilchowa said: "I see large countries filled with hatred and violence, confined with barbed wire. I see burning bodies, the smoke of hellish fires cover the sky. I see a swastika rolling eastwards, which wants to crush the country of the pentagram in vindictive satisfaction. The two criminals of humanity will fight each other using hordes of their slaves and masses of their weapons. The ground will shake under their steps".
At the beginning of 1940, Stanisław Hadyna met her for the last time, asking what would happen to the world. As he wrote in his book, Pilchowa began weeping and shaking, then she said in a quiet voice: "This all is horrible. They are burning people in furnaces. Thousands of people, whole trainloads. They are chased across the forests and snow, behind barbed wires of camps. They are shooting. Pits filled with dead bodies".
Pilchowa died on January 4, 1945 in the Ravensbrück concentration camp. She had been arrested by the SS and shot;

He played for Sunderland, Nelson, Huddersfield Town, Charlton Athletic, Chester City, Port Vale, and Southampton.
Playing career.
Kelly left Hylton Colliery at the age of 19 to sign for Sunderland in 1927. He never made the first team at Roker Park and the following year joined Nelson. He scored 11 goals in 38 appearances in the 1928–29 season, bagging his first goal in the Football League in a 5–1 win over Southport at Haig Avenue on 8 September. He scored four goals in nine Third Division North games in the 1929–30 campaign, before departing Seedhill. 
He signed with Huddersfield Town, and scored seven goals in 14 First Division games in the 1929–30 season. He scored eight goals in 20 appearances for the "Terriers" in the 1930–31 campaign, including a hat-trick against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 10 September. However he played just four games at Leeds Road at the start of the 1931–32 season, before signing with Charlton Athletic, and seeing out the 1931–32 season with six goals in 20 Second Division games for the "Addicks". 
He then left The Valley and joined Chester City. The "Seals" finished fourth in the Third Division North in 1932–33, before posting tenth and third place finishes in 1933–34 and 1934–35 He scored 27 goals in 73 league appearances in his time at Sealand Road. He joined Third Division North side Port Vale for a "substantial fee" in June 1936. Starting off firmly in the first 11, his place slipped away over the 1936–37 season and he went on to score twice in 21 league and cup games. In August 1937 he was given a free transfer from The Old Recreation Ground to Second Division club Southampton. 
A very quick right-winger who could also play as a centre-forward, he arrived at The Dell to add depth to the Southampton forward line. Although he brought a wealth of experience with him, he spent most of his time in the reserves and in his two years on the south coast, he made only 19 first-team appearances, scoring twice. Following the outbreak of the Second World War his professional career ended and he retired from the game.

Buckner Homestead Historic District

The Buckner Homestead Historic District, near Stehekin, Washington in Lake Chelan National Recreation Area incorporates a group of structures relating to the theme of early settlement in the Lake Chelan area. Representing a time period of over six decades, from 1889 to the 1950s, the district comprises 15 buildings, landscape structures and ruins, and over of land planted in orchard and criss-crossed by hand-dug irrigation ditches. The oldest building on the farm is a cabin built in 1889. The Buckner family bought the farm in 1910 and remained there until 1970, when the property was sold to the National Park Service. The Buckner Cabin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The rest of the Buckner farm became a historic district in 1989. Today, the National Park Service maintains the Buckner homestead and farm as an interpretive center to give visitors a glimpse at pioneer farm life in the Stehekin Valley.
Bill Buzzard.
The property that became the Buckner farm was originally settled by William (Bill) Buzzard. It is located several miles north of Lake Chelan along the Stehekin River. When Buzzard arrived in 1889, his parcel was the farthest homestead from the Stehekin settlement at the head of the lake. Buzzard built a one-story log cabin on the site, and cleared some land for pasture and cultivation. In 1892, Buzzard shipped 1,000 pounds of potatoes down Lake Chelan to the town of Chelan, Washington and sold the rest of his crop to local miners. By 1895, Buzzard had planted a small apple orchard and was growing cabbages as well as potatoes. Buzzard also cut cordwood on his property and sold it to the steamboat company that operated on Lake Chelan. According to a 1902 United States Forest Service report on "agricultural settlement" in the Stehekin area, William Buzzard had a three-room house, log barn, and of cultivated land. On 9 November 1903, Buzzard officially purchased his homestead from the United States Government. He later sold to a neighbor.
Buckner family.
In 1910, Buzzard sold his remaining property to a Californian named William Buckner for $5,000. Instead of a lump-sum payment, Buzzard wanted $50 per month until the total amount was paid. After selling the property, Buzzard moved to Chelan where he lived until his death in 1919. When Buzzard died, Buckner was only one payment short of completing the agreement so he used the final $50 payment to purchase a headstone for Buzzard, who was buried in the Old Fraternal Cemetery in Chelan.
In 1911, Buckner brought his wife and three sons to the farm (also call the “Buckner ranch”). Upon arrival, the family found most of the land covered with stumps because the timber had been cut and sold by the previous owner. Over the next several years, the family cleared enough stumps to plant a apple orchard. The Buckners also designed an irrigation system that diverted water from Rainbow Creek to their orchard. The main irrigation canal and watering ditches, totaling over four miles (6 km), were all dug by hand during the summer of 1911.
Initially, the Buckner family only lived on the ranch during the summer, moving back to California in the fall to avoid Stehekin’s harsh winters. However the family returned each spring to work their farm. Over the next few years, they constructed a variety of buildings for protecting animals, sheltering farm equipment, and preserving food. Eventually, the Buckner ranch had more than a dozen structures including a barn, workshop, milk house, smokehouse, root cellar, chicken coop, outhouse, sleeping cabins for guests or hired hands, and several general-purpose sheds. They also built a mile of wooden fence to enclose their entire property.
In 1915, Harry Buckner, one of William’s sons, took up permanent residence at the ranch. In 1919, Harry married a young lady from Stehekin and she joined him at the ranch. Since William Buckner and his wife continued to live in Bill Buzzard’s log cabin during the summer months until 1924, Harry expanded one of sleeping cabins into a home for himself and his new wife, Olive. Harry and Olive worked hard to make the farm a comfortable place to live. They raised pigs, cows and chickens. The family grew vegetables in their garden, and planted large flower beds. When the family decided they wanted electric lights, Harry converted a smokehouse into a power generator house. Harry also built a play house for his three young daughters; and when the girls were older, he constructed a concrete swimming pool, feed by farm’s irrigation system.
In 1922, the Buckners built a large packing shed to protect their apple harvest. In the 1930s and 1940s, the farm produced between 4,000 and 5,000 crates of apple each season. That was enough fruit to fill their by packing shed. This was the peak of the farm’s production.
Olive Buckner died in 1948. Harry continued to live on the ranch and eventually remarried. In 1953, the packing shed roof collapsed under a heavy winter snow load. In 1956, Buckner retired from farming and became Stehekin’s postmaster. In 1970, Buckner sold the homestead and most of his property to the National Park Service, retaining a parcel of land for his retirement home. He lived there until his death in 1976.
National Park Service.
After purchasing the Buckner property, the National Park Service incorporated it into the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. The Buckner homestead and farm has been preserved, and is used by the National Park Service as an interpretive center to show visitors what pioneer life was like in the Stehekin Valley. Although it is no longer a commercial farm, horses still graze in the Buckner’s pasture, water still flows through the irrigation ditches, and apples are still harvested from the orchard in the fall. While some changes have been made to the building in order to preserve them, many of the structures are still in use for their intended purpose, including the main house which is now home for a National Park Service employee.
Because of its unique historic value as an original settler’s homestead, the Buckner Cabin (originally built by William Buzzard) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (NRHP #74000912). In 1989, the remaining elements of the Buckner farm were joined with the cabin to create the Buckner Homestead Historic District. 
Historic structures.
The Buckner Homestead Historic District comprises 15 buildings, various landscape features, some old structural ruins, and approximately of apple orchard which is irrigated by hand-dug ditches. 
Other buildings on the Buckner farm include a sleeping house, tool and equipment sheds, root cellar, chicken coops, outhouse, and a children’s play house. The Buckner’s swimming pool is included on the National Park Services inventory of structures, however, it is kept empty for safety reasons. Old farm equipment, like the Buckner's 1911 Hercules Stump Puller and several farm trucks, are also on display. The National Park Service maintains the Buckner’s orchard, harvesting its apples every fall.

Garwick Glen Halt

Garwick Glen is a rural intermediate request stop on the east coast route of the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man.
Location.
The station lies between Douglas and Laxey and is situated in a small valley of the same name which opens into Garwick Bay. The place name derives from the Manx Gaelic meaning "pleasant bay" derived from an old Celtic word.
History.
The station was once one of the busiest on the whole railway being home to the sprawling pleasure gardens of the same name which operated successfully until the close of the 1965 summer season at which time the station fell into private ownership. The station itself once boasted its own station master and covered waiting shelter for passengers as well as a rustic souvenir stand similar to those still found at Laxey Station today. The glen, with its topiaries and well kept gardens led down to the beach where the shoreline caves were marketed in contemporary literature for the station. At the turn of the 20th century the area was marketed as featuring "smugglers' cove", "hermit's archway" and many other romantic names and the site was dominated by the hotel of the same name (now a private dwelling and not available for public viewing). There is also a large lake in the grounds, which are home to the island's only maze.
Decline.
Despite closure the station remained open as seldom used, and the structures were not demolished until 1978 at which time the site was cleared. There remains in situ a crossover set of points to facilitate short workings to and from Derby Castle but this has not been used for many years. From the passing tram a solitary overgrown section of brick wall is the only reminder of this once-busy station. The glen and its grounds have been open to the public on several special open days in recent times but such occasions have now ceased.

Bagnaccio

Bagnaccio is the name of the ancient thermal baths still in use 8 km northwest of Viterbo, in the Lazio region of Italy. It is also known as 'La città termale' aka the Thermal City because of its natural hot thermal springs, or the City of the Popes 'La città dei Papi' because the popes were based here in the Middle Ages. 
The Bagnaccio baths are located directly on what was the ancient via Cassia on the road to Montefiascone while the via Cassia now runs about 1 km east of the baths. The site was and is still marked by the ancient Roman ruins of Baccucco, a small baths complex on the same narrow unpaved road 'strada bianca' and these baths were recorded in designs by Michelangelo (Lille).
For two millennia these baths have functioned freely and openly to anyone, and traditionally they host families during the daylight hours while after sunset are openly gay and attract gay men from Northern Lazio, Southern Tuscany, Umbria and, on the weekends, also many Romans. The baths, or 'pozzi' are sited on land belonging to a well-respected, well-off and liberal family of Viterbo who believe that they should remain free to all. The baths are now 'administered' by a not-for-profit group: Friends of Bagnaccio comprising mainly the families who use it during the day. The area of the baths is delimited by fencing with one car park for cars and another for campers. This is reached at the end of a long 'strada bianca' or gravel road 'strada Garinei'. From Viterbo one heads north on the Cassia towards Montefiascone for three kilometres until the turn off, on the left, with signs indicating the town of 'Marta', after which one proceeds another kilometre until just after the curve one arrives at the 'strada Garinei' on the left.

TV-band device

TV band devices or TVBDs are new unlicensed radio frequency devices operating in the vacant channels or white spaces between US television channels in the range of 54 to 698 MHz. The rules defining these devices were announced on November 4, 2008, and published by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in a Second Report and Order on November 14, 2008. The rules were finalized in a Second Memorandum Opinion and Order on September 23, 2010. Much of the work behind the definition of these devices was done by the White Spaces Coalition. 
Types of TVBDs.
Fixed devices may use any of the vacant US TV channels 2, 5-36 and 38-51 with a power of up to 1 watt (4 watts EIRP). They may communicate with each other on any of these channels, and also with personal/portable devices in the TV channels 21 through 51. Fixed devices must be location-aware, query an FCC-mandated database at least daily to retrieve a list of usable channels at their location, and must also monitor the spectrum locally. They may transmit only within the TV channels where both the database indicates operation is permissible, and no signals are detected locally. Personal/portable stations may operate only on channels 21-36 and 38-51, with a power of 100 mW EIRP, or 40 mW if on a channel adjacent to a nearby television channel. They may either retrieve a list of permissible channels from an associated fixed station, or may accept a lower output power of 50 mW EIRP and use only spectrum sensing.<r
Power Spectral Density (PSD) Limits.
The maximum power transmitted in any 100 kHz segment of spectrum is subject to the following limitations
Transmit Power Control.
All TVBDs must incorporate a feature to reduce transmitted power to the minimum level necessary to maintain successful communication.
Antenna Height Restriction.
The transmit antenna used with fixed devices may not be more than 30 meters above the ground. Fixed devices may not be located at sites where the height above average terrain (HAAT) is greater than 76 meters.

Bradford Hotel (New York City)

The Bradford Hotel is a New York City establishment which opened on October 18, 1924, at 206 "-" 22 West 70th Street in Manhattan. It cost $2 million to build and was owned by the Lapidus Engineering Company. The same firm controlled the Hotel Oxford which opened in 1923.
The apartment hotel is sixteen stories and occupied a plot 150 by 100 between Broadway (Manhattan) and West End Avenue. It contains four hundred rooms., each with private bathrooms, kitchenettes, and many with terraces. It was being converted to a project for the elderly by January 1970.
Ownership history.
In January 1954 the Marson Corporation, headed by Morris and Rubin Marcus, purchased the lease on the Bradford Hotel. The lease ran for sixteen years and was sold through Des Gabor, vice-president of the M. Morgenthau Seixas Company, brokers. The lease mandated a yearly rental of more than $110,000. In March 1959 the lease was bought by the Lincoln Bradford Corporation headed by William Pitchford. The Pitchford group held it until August 1959 when it was purchased by a group headed by Jack Brooks. From the Brooks syndicate the lease was purchased by Jack Tish, Herbert Tenenbaum, and Aaron Rashap. A 1950s Lincoln Square development project left the Bradford and the adjoining Chalfonte Hotel intact.
Noteworthy resident.
Isidor Kiefer, a retired machine tools manufacturer from Worms, Germany, was a resident of the Bradford Hotel, when he died in October 1961. He came to the United States as a refugee in 1935. Kiefer was the author of a history of the Worms synagogue, to which he belonged. He assisted in rebuilding the synagogue which had been destroyed by the Nazis.

Les Bêtises

"Les Bêtises" (French translation for Stupid Things) is a 1985 song recorded by French artist Sabine Paturel. Released in March 1986 as her debut single from her album "Cœur Bébé", released two years later, on which it is the sixth track. The song was a smash hit in France, even if it failed to top the chart. It was covered by several artists throughout the years and became a popular song.
Song information.
Written and composed by Sylvain Lebel and Dominique Pankratoff, "Les Bêtises" is a song recorded as a nursery rhyme. It was qualified as full of mischievousness that could be subtitled "the rhyme of a calamity". In the lyrics, "the performer tells the disasters which she carried out to punish her boyfriend for having left her". Paturel performs the song with a childlike voice.
As proof of its notability, the song was included on many French compilations released in the 2000s, such as "Absolument 80 : Tubes français vol. 1", "Nostalgie Classiques 80", "Nos années 80 - Platinum Collection", "Top 50 - Vol. 2" and "Les 100 plus grands tubes 80's".
Chart performances.
In France, the single debuted at #50 on the SNEP Singles Chart on March 22, 1986. It climbed quickly and entered the top ten in its sixth week. It remained in it for 19 weeks, including a peak at #2 for five consecutive weeks, being unable to disloge Princess Stéphanie of Monaco's huge hit "Ouragan" which topped the chart then. The song fell off the chart (top 50) after 30 weeks. On the 1986 Year-End Chart, the song ranked #3, behind "Les Démons de minuit" and "Ouragan".
The song is currently the 260th best-selling single of all time in France.
Cover versions.
The song was covered in 2006 by Bébé Lilly. Produced by Teetoff, the song was the second single from the album "Mon monde à moi" and was released on June 2, 2006. This version, released in a CD single version containing the 3:02 cover version, the 4:33 song "Le Coupe du monde" and a techno version of the music video for "Les Bêtises", achieved success in France where it was a top 8 hit and remained on the chart (top 100) for twenty weeks. The song was ranked for two weeks in Switzerland and peaked at #90.
"Les Bêtises" was also covered by Leslie on her cover album "80 Souvenirs". In 2010, Les Enfoirés recorded a cover of the song for their album "La Crise de nerfs!" ; the singers on this version are Jean-Louis Aubert, Zazie, Jean-Jacques Goldman, Jean-Baptiste Maunier and Jenifer Bartoli.

Ciudad del Motor de Aragón

The Ciudad del Motor de Aragón, also known as Motorland Aragón, is a motorsport race track located near Alcañiz, Spain.
The circuit has been designed by well-known German architect Hermann Tilke in conjunction with the British architectural firm Foster + Partners. Formula One driver and Ferrari test driver Pedro de la Rosa is a technical and sporting consultant on the project.
The facility has been designed to incorporate three main zones – a technology park, a sports area and a leisure and culture area. The technology park will feature research and educational institutes based around the motor industry, the sports area will include the racing circuit (with multiple layouts), a karting track and various gravel circuits, whilst the leisure and culture section will feature a hotel, business centre and shopping facilities.
It was announced on 26 May 2008 that the circuit will host a round of the World Series by Renault in both 2009 and 2010, the first international championship to race at the venue. Renault Sport Technologies will also have access to the circuit for thirty days per year for testing and promotional events.
On 18 March 2010, Motorland Aragón was announced as a replacement for the Balatonring on the 2010 MotoGP calendar. Aragón was already in place as a reserve event and replaces the Hungarian race which was postponed because of overrunning construction work. This made the Aragon motorcycle Grand Prix the fourth Spanish race on the calendar. In March 2011 Dorna Sports signed a contract with the circuit to make it a permanent entry on the main calendar until at least 2016. On 19 May 2010, it was announced that the circuit will hold a round of the Superbike World Championship from 2011, with a three-year deal being agreed.
The circuit was used as part of stage seven of the 2012 Vuelta a España.

<doc id="20279439" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20279439" title="Shakespeare's Birthplace">
Shakespeare's Birthplace

Shakespeare's Birthplace is a restored 16th-century half-timbered house situated in Henley Street, Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England, where it is believed that William Shakespeare was born in 1564 and spent his childhood years. It is now a small museum open to the public and a popular visitor attraction, owned and managed by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. It has been referred to as "a Mecca for all lovers of literature".
Description.
The house itself is relatively simple, but for the late 16th century it would have been considered quite a substantial dwelling. John Shakespeare, William's father, was a glove maker and wool dealer, and the house was originally divided in two parts to allow him to carry out his business from the same premises.
The building is not outstanding architecturally, and typical of the times was constructed in wattle and daub around a wooden frame. Local oak from the Forest of Arden and blue-grey stone from Wilmcote were used in its construction, while the large fireplaces were made from an unusual combination of early brick and stone, and the ground-floor level has stone-flagged floors.
The plan of the building was originally a simple rectangle. From north-west to south-east, the ground-floor consisted of a parlour with fireplace, an adjoining hall with a large open hearth, a cross passage, and finally a room which probably served as John Shakespeare's workshop. This arrangement was mirrored on the first-floor by three chambers accessed by a staircase from the hall, probably where the present stairs are sited. Traditionally, the chamber over the parlour is the birthroom. A separate single-bay house, now known as Joan Hart's Cottage, was later built onto the north-west end of the house, and the present kitchen was added at the rear with a chamber above it.
History.
There are differing views concerning the origin of the building, which possibly dates back to the 15th century, but more likely was built in the mid-16th century.
Records show that in 1552 John Shakespeare was fined for leaving a pile of muck outside his home in Henley Street, proving that he resided in a house there at the time. The house remained in the family until it was handed down for the final time to William Shakespeare’s daughter and, given that he was born in 1564, it is fairly certain that he was born and brought up there.
Ownership.
The ownership of the premises passed to William on John Shakespeare's death. However, by that time William already owned New Place in Stratford and had no need for the Henley Street premises as a home for himself or his family. Consequently, the main house was leased to Lewis Hiccox, who converted it into an inn known as the Maidenhead (later the Swan and Maidenhead Inn), and the small, one-bay house to the north-west was put to residential use. By the time of Shakespeare's death in 1616 it was occupied by Joan Hart, his recently widowed sister.
Under the terms of Shakespeare's will, the ownership of the whole property (the inn and Joan Hart's cottage) passed to his elder daughter, Susanna. In 1649 it passed to her only child, Elizabeth, and then in 1670 to Thomas Hart. Hart was the descendant of Shakespeare's sister, Joan, whose family had continued as tenants of the smaller house after her death in 1646. The entire property remained in the ownership of the Harts until 1806, when it was sold to a butcher, Thomas Court, who also took over the running of the Swan and Maidenhead Inn. The smaller house remained occupied by Thomas Hornby, another butcher, to whom the Harts had let it when they moved away from Stratford in the 1790s. Mrs Hornby continued as a tenant and custodian of Shakespeare's Birthplace until her rent was increased in 1820. She left in a huff and moved across Henley Street, where she set up a shop displaying what she claimed were genuine Shakespeare curiosities, competing with the 'official' house across the road for the patronage of visitors.
Acquisition.
Once the family line had come to an end, the house was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair until a rekindling of interest in the 18th century. Isaac Watts, Charles Dickens, Sir Walter Scott and Thomas Carlyle were among the notables that visited the birthplace and autographed the walls and windows. Many of the signatures still remain on the windowpanes around the house, although the signed walls have long since been painted over. A guest registry book includes the signatures of Lord Byron, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, John Keats, and William Thackeray.
Interest in the property again increased when the whole premises were put up for sale on the death of Court's widow in 1846. The American showman P. T. Barnum proposed to buy the home and ship it "brick-by-brick" to the US. In response, the Shakespeare Birthday Committee (becoming the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust by a private Act of Parliament) was established and, with the help of such luminaries as Dickens, the Committee raised the necessary £3,000 and bought it the following year.
Restoration.
Once the Committee (Trust) had acquired the building, restoration work was able to proceed. Originally the Birthplace formed part of a terrace with later houses built either side, and the first stage in its conservation was their destruction, thought necessary to avoid the risk of any fire spreading from them to the Birthplace.
Old photographs reveal that early in the 19th century, part of the front of the Birthplace was faced with brick. This was an economical alternative to the common practice of replacing timber-framed buildings and rebuilding in brick in 18th century England. Referring to an engraving of 1769 as well as taking into account surviving architectural evidence, a reconstruction carried out by the Trust between 1857 and 1864 has restored the outside of the building to its 16th century state.
Present day.
Adjoining the Birthplace is the Shakespeare Centre, a contrasting modern glass and concrete visitors centre which forms the headquarters of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. The driving force behind its construction, and opening in 1964, was Dr Levi Fox, OBE, Director of the Trust from 1945 to 1989, with a view to properly housing its library, documents and collections. As well as showing Shakespeare-related displays, the Shakespeare Centre also provides public access to the Birthplace.
The Birthplace recreates a picture of family life at the time of Shakespeare complete with period domestic furnishings, a glass window inscribed with the signatures of visitors to the house over the centuries, and John Shakespeare's glove making workshop. There is also a display relating the tale of Mrs Hornby.
Other exhibitions illustrate the changing occupancy and functions of the Birthplace (from Shakespeare's time onwards): as a home, workshop, inn, butcher's shop, literary shrine and visitor attraction.
The walled garden at the back of the house has been specially planted with flowers and herbs that would have been known in Shakespeare's time.

<doc id="20279444" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20279444" title="Cold front">
Cold front

A cold front is defined as the leading edge of a cooler mass of air, replacing (at ground level) a warmer mass of air, which lies within a fairly sharp surface trough of low pressure. It forms in the wake of an extratropical cyclone, at the leading edge of its cold air advection pattern, which is also known as the cyclone's dry conveyor belt circulation. Temperature changes across the boundary can exceed . When enough moisture is present, rain can occur along the boundary. If there is significant instability along the boundary, a narrow line of thunderstorms can form along the frontal zone. If instability is less, a broad shield of rain can move in behind the front, which increases the temperature difference across the boundary. They are stronger in the fall and spring transition seasons, and weakest during the summer. When they catch up with the preceding warm front, the portion of the boundary which does so is then known as an occluded front.
Development of cold front.
The cooler and denser air wedges under the less-dense warmer air, lifting it. This upward motion causes lowered pressure along the cold front and can cause the formation of a narrow line of showers and thunderstorms when enough moisture is present. On weather maps, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel. A cold front's location is at the leading edge of the temperature drop off, which in an isotherm analysis would show up as the leading edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts move faster than warm fronts and can produce sharper changes in weather. Since cold air is denser than warm air, it rapidly replaces the warm air preceding the boundary.
In the northern hemisphere, a cold front usually causes a shift of wind from southwest to northwest clockwise, also known as veering, and in the southern hemisphere a shift from northeast to southwest, in a clockwise manner. Normally, cold fronts can be marked by these characteristics:
Precipitation.
A cold front commonly brings a narrow band of precipitation that follows along the leading edge of the cold front. These bands of precipitation are often very strong in nature, and can bring severe thunderstorms, hailstorms and/or tornadoes. In the spring, these cold fronts can be very strong, and can bring strong winds when the pressure gradient is tighter than normal. During the winter months, cold fronts sometimes come through an area with little or no precipitation. Wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts which tend to have more stratiform, and less convective, precipitation. These rainstorms sometimes bring flooding, and can move very slowly when the storm steering it is strong and embedded within a meridional flow pattern (with more pole to equator motion rather than west to east motion). In the winter, cold fronts can bring cold spells, and occasionally snow. In the spring or summer in temperate latitudes, hail may occasionally fall along with the rain. If moisture is not sufficient, such as when a system has previously moved across a mountain barrier, cold fronts can pass without cloudiness.
Undercutting.
The idea that cold air wedges, or undercuts, the warm air is often used to depict how advancing cold fronts force warm air to rise along the sloping cold air, much like a snow shovel scooping up snow, creating instability. Provided with sufficient moisture, the rising air would thus condense, creating storms, clouds, and/or rain. While this concept is used to generally describe frontal precipitation patterns, it is technically incorrect.
Frontogenetical Circulation.
Frontogenesis is the process of creating or steepening the temperature gradient of a front. During this process the atmosphere reacts in an attempt to restore balance, the consequence is a circular motion along the front where air is being lifted up, along the cold front and dropping downward, behind the frontal boundary. This is the actual force of upward motion along a front that is responsible for clouds and precipitation.
As the temperature gradient steepens during frontogenesis, the thermal wind becomes imbalanced. To maintain balance, the geostrophic wind aloft and below adjust, such that regions of divergence/convergence form. Mass continuity would require a vertical transport of air along the cold front where there is divergence (lowered pressure). Although this circulation is described by a series of processes, they are actually occurring at the same time, observable along the front as a thermally direct circulation. There are several factors that influence the final shape and tilt of the circulation around the front, ultimately determining the type and location of clouds and precipitation.
Temperature changes.
Cold fronts are the leading edge of cooler air masses, hence the name "cold front". They have stronger temperature changes during the fall (autumn) and spring and during the middle of winter. Temperature changes associated with cold fronts can be as much as 50°F (30°C). When cold fronts come through, there is usually a quick, yet strong gust of wind, that shows that the cold front is passing. In surface weather observations, a remark known as FROPA is coded when this occurs. The effects from a cold front can last from hours to days. The air behind the front is cooler than the air it is replacing and the warm air is forced to rise, so it cools. As the cooler air can′t hold as much moisture as warm air, clouds form and rain occurs.
Characteristics of boundaries around an extratropical cyclone.
Cold fronts form when a cooler air mass moves into an area of warmer air in the wake of a developing extratropical cyclone. The warmer air interacts with the cooler air mass along the boundary, and usually produces precipitation. Cold fronts often follow a warm front or squall line. Very commonly, cold fronts have a warm front ahead but with a perpendicular orientation. In areas where cold fronts catch up to the warm front, the occluded front develops. Occluded fronts have an area of warm air aloft. When such a feature forms poleward of an extratropical cyclone, it is known as a trowal, which is short for TRough Of Warm Air aLoft. A cold front is considered a warm front if it begins to retreat ahead of the next extratropical cyclone along the frontal boundary, and called a stationary front if it stalls.

Balladromma Beg Halt

Balladromma Beg is an intermediate stopping place on the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man.
Alias.
The halt is sometimes referred to as "Halfway House" in reference to the nearby public house and one-time coaching house, now known as the Liverpool Arms.
Facilities.
Today it remains as a request stop marked by a solitary sign denoting the fact, and a post box mounted in a concrete pillar, a remnant of the days when the railway held the contract for mail collection which it held until 1975 when winter closure necessitated its demise. The station once had a waiting shelter for passengers which took the form of a traditional M.E.R. style corrugated iron hut. This was installed circa 1900 but has long since been demolished. Nearby is a modern bus shelter used for the island's Bus Vannin services which doubles up as a shelter for waiting tram passengers at this rural location.
Traffic.
The majority of traffic at this spot is gleaned from customers to the nearby public house which was often reached by tramcar until relatively recently when timetable cutbacks and modifications ensured that this was no longer viable for most, bus services being preferred.
Location.
To the immediate north of the halt, the railway crosses the main Douglas-Laxey road for the first time, the halt itself sits to the north of an un-gated level crossing carrying the Douglas-Baldrine coast road. At one time this was a railway-operated toll road.

Caterham Academy

The Caterham Academy is a motor-racing championship exclusively open to novices, as their first foray into motorsport.
Scholarship years - 1995-1999.
In 1995 the Caterham Scholarship, a novices-only speed events and racing series, was established in the UK, to introduce new drivers to motorsport. The series format was a mix of sprints, hillclimbs and circuit races.
Ford Crossflow Cars 1995-97.
The initial cars were live axle 1600cc Ford 'Kent' Crossflows with rear-exit exhausts. The spec included a Caterham lightened & balanced flywheel, uprated competition clutch cover and drive plate, Caterham distributor with Ignitor electronic ignition, two Weber twin choke 40 DCOE 151 (sidedraft) carburettors, main jets size 120, 30mm venturi, with K&N performance filters. The maximum power was 100 bhp at 6000 rpm. They ran on list 1A Michelin MXT tyres.
Early Vauxhall Cars - 1998.
In 1998, the engine supplier changed to Vauxhall, with 1600 single overhead cam engines being used. They featured a ported & skimmed cylinder head, standard Vauxhall camshaft, flywheel and clutch cover plate, two Weber twin choke 40 DCOE 151 (sidedraft) carburettors, main jets size 115, with K&N performance filters. The maximum power was 101 ps at 5,500 rpm and a max torque of 107 lb ft at 3,600 rpm. The main visual difference between the Fords and the Vauxhalls was that the Vauxhalls had a side-exit exhaust, as opposed to the rear exit of the Fords.
The early Vauxhall cars used the same Spax dampers with manual adjusters as the Fords, with an option to adjustable spring platforms.
Later Vauxhall Cars.
The 1999 and 2000 Vauxhall cars had linear coil springs over Bilstein (rather than Spax) dampers, again with the option of adjustable spring platforms, to optimise corner-weighting.
Rebranding to 'Academy'.
For the 2000 season, the Scholarship was rebranded the "Caterham Academy"
Academy Years - 2001-2006.
For the 2001 Academy, cars were supplied with the more modern Dedion chassis, and a Rover K series engine. An increasing number of cars were supplied with full rollover cages by this point, although it was not until 2003 that all Academy cars came with a full cage rather than a FIA-spec rollover bar and supporting strut in the passenger footwell.
Cars were supplied with the Caterham (Arch Motors) race chassis in 2001 and 2002. This is recognisable by a shorter passenger footwell (to accommodate the battery in the engine bay) and the handbrake under the dash on the passenger side. Cars from 2003 to 2006 were supplied with a centre (tunnel) handbrake.
From 2004, the Academy chassis was modified slightly and made more rigid. The transmission tunnel was raised slightly, and all cars were supplied with a lowered floorpan, giving the driver a couple of inches more headroom under the rollcage. The rollcage supplier changed at this point, as cars were supplied with 'Caged' rollover cages with slightly curved bars and different frontal load protection, rather than the 'Safety Devices' cages with straight diagonal bars of 2001 to 2003.
2005 cars were supplied with the new style combined side-impact and wheel intrusion bar, which allows the doors to open (the older style bar does not).
2006 cars were supplied with a new D-style 'Caged' rollcage. 2006 was the last year of the Arch Motors Academy chassis.
Move to Metric Chassis - 2007.
In 2007, manufacture of the Academy chassis was moved to 'Caged' in Bristol, and the chassis were now largely computer-made and metric rather than imperial in their measurements. Other than that, the chassis were much the same as the 2004-onwards ones, albeit with some modifications in the engine bay area to accommodate the upcoming Sigma engines. The engines remained the Rover K-series for 2007.
Move to Sigma Engines - 2008.
In 2008, Caterham moved from the K-series to the Ford Sigma engine, supplied in a 1.6 litre format. The Caged chassis was modified to incorporate the new engine (such as the exhaust exiting on the right via a 4-branch system with separate catalytic converter), and a number of new parts were manufactured.
The current Academy package (2014) is that for £21,495, entrants get a modified Roadsport kit (although a factory-built option is available for extra cost) with a sealed Ford Sigma engine and 5-speed gearbox. Having completed the ARDS (racing) licence qualification, the season then consists of a setup day, three speed events (sprints and hillclimbs), and four circuit races.
In recent years there have been 2 Academy groups, each of 28 drivers. For 2009, there were plans to run 3 groups of 28 entrants, but ultimately this did not come to pass. 2010's Academy also has two groups.
Post-Academy Racing.
There is now a considerable amount of racing choice available for cars and drivers who have completed the Academy, both in the Caterham Motorsport Ladder and in the Caterham Graduates Racing Club.
A number of drivers leave the Caterham Academy and move on to other forms of racing, and an equal number sell up and never race again. But most move into either Roadsport B or Roadsport A or into Grads racing.

The Reporter (newspaper)

The Reporter is an American weekly community newspaper based in the Chicago suburb of Palos Heights, Illinois, and serves the Illinois communities of Oak Lawn, Evergreen Park, Worth, Chicago Ridge, Palos Hills and Hickory Hills. It has both print and online editions, with a print circulation of 18,000. It is a Thursday newspaper delivered to subscribers via mail, but hits news stands Wednesday.
The newspaper is produced and printed by Regional Publishing Corp., which also publishes "The Regional News" and many high school and college newspapers including those of Joliet Catholic Academy, Oak Lawn Community High School, Carl Sandburg High School, Moraine Valley Community College, Elmhurst College and the City Colleges of Chicago.
History.
It was founded in 1960 to serve Worth, Chicago Ridge, Palos Hills and Hickory Hills. The newspaper was known for many years as the Worth-Palos Reporter, the name signifying the two townships the newspaper serves (and still referred to as such by many older readers, despite not carrying that name since the mid-1980s). The paper eventually added Alsip, Crestwood and Bridgeview to its coverage area. The paid-circulation newspaper expanded again in 1983 into Oak Lawn – one of the largest municipalities today in south suburban Cook County – and Evergreen Park.
Charles Richards, then-owner of Regional Publishing Corp., purchased the newspaper in 1986. Most of the existing staff was retained as was the office in Chicago Ridge. A year later, the newspaper's office was moved to Regional Publishing's office at 12247 S. Harlem Ave. in Palos Heights. The newspaper eventually dropped Alsip, Crestwood and Bridgeview from its coverage area.
It established an online edition in January 2006. The website includes videos and sports blogs, as well as news updates during the time between print editions.
Coverage.
The newspaper publishes three editions: Palos Hills-Hickory Hills, Worth-Chicago Ridge and Oak Lawn-Evergreen Park. The only differences among the three editions are the front pages, which each carry news most specific to the two towns each edition serves. The newspaper places a strong emphasis on local news and is known as a "hyperlocal" newspaper, meaning it covers almost exclusively news and events relevant only to the people in the communities it serves, and rarely covers news outside those communities regardless of the magnitude. For example, the paper did not cover the 2008 presidential election; however, did write localized stories related to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 because members of the communities the newspaper serves participated in relief efforts in Louisiana and Mississippi.
It also has an award-winning sports section that covers local high-school and college athletics. Some subscribers get the newspaper solely for this section, called Sports Southwest. Sports editor Ken Karrson does most of the writing and managing editor Jason Maholy doubles as sports photographer.
The newspaper's arts and entertainment section, Out & About, includes movie reviews, an events calendar, and the occasional restaurant review. The section received second place in its class (Division C, which includes the largest non-daily newspapers in Illinois) in 2008 from the Illinois Press Association.
Staff.
The newspaper is published by Amy Richards, who took over Regional Publishing from her father, Charles, in 2005. Its managing editor is Jason Maholy and its staff writers include Bob Jaderberg and Kevin Olsen. Contributing writers are movie reviewer Jase Howell, and health columnists Dee Woods (alternative medicine) and Anthony "The Wine Guy" Scarano (naturopathic medicine).

Molecular modeling on GPUs

Molecular modeling on GPU is the technique of using a graphics processing unit (GPU) for molecular simulations.
In 2007, NVIDIA introduced video cards that could be used not only to show graphics but also for scientific calculations. These cards include many arithmetic units (currently up to 1536) working in parallel. Long before this event, the computational power of video cards was used to accelerate calculations. What was new is that NVIDIA made it possible to develop parallel programs in a high-level language. This technology substantially simplified programming by enabling programs to be written in C/C++.
Quantum chemistry calculations and molecular mechanics simulations (molecular modeling in terms of classical mechanics) are among beneficial applications of this technology. The video cards can accelerate the calculations tens of times, so a PC with such a card has the power similar to that of a cluster of workstations based on common processors.

Escola Brasileira de Administração Pública e de Empresas

The Escola Brasileira de Administração Pública e de Empresas (EBAPE, "Brazilian School of Public and Business Administration") is a Brazilian private higher education institution founded in April 1952 and linked to the Fundação Getúlio Vargas. The School also works as a research institution. Its academic programs include: Undergraduation in Administration, Online Undergraduation in Technological Management Processes (FGV Online), Master of Public Administration, Executive Master of Business Administration, Doctor of Administration and Post-Doctorate in Administration.
EBAPE has played an important role in training university and government personnel both in Brazil and in other countries in Latin America and Africa, also fostering cooperation between institutions and exchange programs. Over the years, these programs have been an incentive for developing joint research efforts and technical counseling projects with other Administration Schools.
It's academic policy is formulated by the Consultative Council made up of its faculty members. The Board of Directors is responsible for administration of the School, though its Academic Training and Research Centers, Lato Sensu Graduate Center and Consultancy, Training and Managerial Development Centers.
In addition to the activities conducted at its head offices in Rio de Janeiro, EBAPE has extended and consolidated its work in regional centers around the country and abroad. Special programs in technical training and consultancy are held in Brasília and other Brazilian cities.
Undergraduation.
Located at the headquarters of the foundation, the undergraduate program of EBAPE is recognized as one of the best business schools of Brazil and even Latin America, although being part of a great and famous university, it is a school for a very restricted number of students. The school offers only 50 seats per year and currently has less than 400 students. <br>
Despite the little number of students, EBAPE is one of the few schools of Brazil that has about 50 full-time professors. <br>
All professors are PhDs and virtually all recent graduated students are already employed.
The program is divided in two cycles. The first two years constitute the Basic Management Cycle comprises courses that are the core issues and concepts central to the formation of the administrator. Matters concerning the area of mathematics develop the habit of logical and objective.
During the past two years that comprise the Professional Cycle, that provides students with the tools and expertise related to business administration and public policy. The disciplines to be taught in the last four semesters of course complement the knowledge acquired in Basic Cycle. The Professional Cycle also features two distinct emphases in Public Administration and Business Administration. The student, upon entering the 7th period, should choose which branch he would like to take to further the studies.
The college has strong rules of conduct and behavior, where no student or employee can enter the building dressed in shorts or slippers. It also hardly supports festivals or sporting events.
Online Courses.
EBAPE regulates the graduate course in technological management processes in partnership with FGV Online.
This course is recognized by Associação Brasileira dos Estudantes de Educação a Distância (ABE-DL, "Brazilian Association of Students of Distance Education") as the best distance learning course in the country, where only the FGV has received top marks in the assessment.
Publications.
RAP (Revista de Administração Pública).
The EBAPE publishes since 1967, the Revista de Administração Pública ("Public Administration Magazine"), printed bimonthly, with high circulation on the technical-scientific sector.
The publication receives sponsorship financing from:
RPBG (Revista Portuguesa e Brasileira de Gestão).
The Revista Portuguesa e Brasileira de Gestão ("Brazilian and Portuguese Journal of Management"), is a joint publication of INDEG/ISCTE and the Fundação Getulio Vargas since 2002, with simultaneous distribution in Portugal and Brazil, is a quarterly that provides a scientific approach and also disseminates the various areas of Management .

<doc id="20279608" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20279608" title="Distant Star">
Distant Star

Distant Star ("Estrella distante" in Spanish) is a novella by Chilean author Roberto Bolaño, first published in Spanish in 1996. Chris Andrews’s English translation was published by New Directions in 2004. The story is based on the chapter "The Infamous Ramírez Hoffman" from Bolaño's book "Nazi Literature in the Americas", where the protagonist's name is Carlos Ramírez Hoffman.
Plot summary.
The book is narrated from a distance by Arturo B. (probably Arturo Belano, Bolaño's frequent stand-in) and tells the story of Alberto Ruiz-Tagle, an aviator who exploits the 1973 Chilean coup d'état to launch his own version of the New Chilean Poetry: a multi-media enterprise involving sky-writing, torture, photography, murder, and verse. The narrator first encounters him in a college poetry workshop, where Ruiz-Tagle only has eyes for the beautiful Garmendia twins, Veronica and Angelica. As the novel progresses it becomes clear that Ruiz-Tagle is far more and far less than a mere poet through progressively darker and ironic twists and turns.
The next sighting comes as the narrator stands in prison camp for political undesirables, gazing up at a WWII Messerchmitt skywriting over the Andes. The aviator is none other than Ruiz-Tagle, now serving in the Chilean force under his actual name, Carlos Wieder, and writing nationalist slogans in the sky. The narrator becomes obsessed with Ruiz-Tagle, suspecting that he is behind every evil act in Pinochet’s regime. After his release the narrator struggles to survive and make sense of his situation, but his destiny is eventually reconnected with that of Ruiz-Tagle/Wieder when a Chilean private detective seeks his help in tracking Wieder down by trying to identify the airforce pilot's hand behind various articles printed in neo-fascist publications.
"The Infamous Ramírez Hoffman".
As stated in its introduction, "Distant Star" is an expansion of the final chapter of Bolaño's earlier work, "Nazi Literature in the Americas", an encyclopedic novel composed of short biographies of imaginary Pan-American authors on the political right. The section, entitled "The Infamous Ramírez Hoffman", is the longest in the novel and is markedly different than the other sections of the book, taking on a less encyclopedic and more personal tone. In the expansion of the text some of the characters' names remained unchanged (e.g. the narrator's fellow prisoner Norberto and the detective Abel Ramirez) but for most of the main characters the names were altered:
In spite of the differences between the texts Bolaño places them within the same fictional world, claiming that the story was narrated to him by Arturo B. in "Nazi Literature in the Americas", but Arturo was displeased with the outcome:

<doc id="20279635" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20279635" title="Groudle Glen railway station">
Groudle Glen railway station

Groudle Glen Station is the first mandatory stopping point and major station on the Manx Electric Railway which serves the village of Groudle Glen in the Isle of Man, and is situated between Groudle Lane and Eskadale on the route to Laxey and Ramsey.
Beginnings.
The station was the first terminus of the line in 1893, the following year an extension was opened as far as Laxey and the station became an intermediate one. The building that still occupies the site, consisting of a large open waiting shelter incorporating ticket office, dates from the beginning of the railway, but has been unmanned for many years. Despite its somewhat basic appearance and lack of facilities, the station was one of the most popular on the line, serving the glen which operated as pleasure grounds, the adjacent hotel and nearby narrow gauge railway. The hill figure next to it reading "GROUDLE" was placed next to the shelter in a more recent date.
Centenary.
The station was considerably refurbished in 1993 for the island's Year Of Railways to mark the centenary of the electric line; at this time, as well as receiving remedial attention to the shelter itself (including paving of the area and repainting, and the addition of old-fashioned advert signs) the surrounding area was also smartened up, with stone walling put in place denoting the station environs, and cast concrete letters being installed in the banking denoting the station name. A plaque marking the occasion of the centenary was unveiled by the Lieutenant Governor Sir Laurence Jones and remains in situ today.
Postbox.
The station also features a post box, dating from the early part of the 20th century when the Manx Electric Railway held the contract for collection of mail at all stations and halts along its routes. The contract was lost in 1975 when the railway closed for the winter and could therefore not provide year-round collection facilities. Despite this, the station retains the post box, which is now cleared by Post Office staff in road vehicles. This practice continues at the other stopping places on the line, and is one of the distinctive features of even the most basic and remote of the line's stopping places.
Connections.
One of the main draws to the area today is that Groudle Glen has its own heritage railway nearby, the Groudle Glen Railway, which was built in 1896 to serve the zoo which had opened 1893 on the outer edge of the glen. The two-foot gauge line ran intermittently after the Second World War and finally closed in 1962. It was restored in the 1980s by the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association and reopened fully in 1992. The line now operates each weekend in the summer and for certain other events. The railway's main station is a short but steep walk from Groudle Glen Station through the glen.
Groudle Glen Hotel.
Directly opposite the station is the now closed Groudle Glen Hotel which was built upon the arrival of the railway in 1893 and designed by the renowned architect Baillie Scott. It operated as a public bar for many years before being sold by the local brewery in 1999 and converted into a restaurant known as "La Casa". Its remote location ensured that the venture was not entirely successful; however, the new owners did much aesthetic work on the building, restoring stained glass windows, recreating historical signage and completely repainting the building including much of the original detailing such as the "three legs" motifs in the cornice work.

A prototype single locomotive, No. 151 Grosvenor, was designed by Stroudley and produced by Brighton railway works in December 1874. This was extensively tested before a second, scaled down locomotive No. 325 Abergavenny, was ordered in June 1876 and completed in January 1877. Both locomotives performed adequately, but Abergavenny was significantly less powerful than Grosvenor. A modified design was developed and twelve further locomotives were built between December 1880 and November 1881.
The members of this class worked express trains between London and South Coast towns such as Portsmouth, Brighton and Eastbourne, and covered large mileages. The introduction of the Billinton B2 class made the singles redundant on the Portsmouth line and so several were transferred to Tunbridge Wells.
Withdrawals began in May 1905 and the last locomotive survived until May 1914. No examples have been preserved, but there is a model of No.331 Fairlight in the museum at Sheffield Park on the Bluebell Railway.

Klaus Schmiegel

Klaus Schmiegel (born June 28, 1939) is most famous for his work in organic chemistry, which led to the invention of Prozac, a widely used antidepressant. Born in Chemitz, Germany, he moved to the U.S. in 1951 to continue his education. After he finished his schooling, Schmiegel joined Eli Lilly as a senior organic chemist; he worked there from 1968 until his retirement in 1993. There, he collaborated with Bryan Molloy to create a new group of compounds. One of them, fluoxetine hydrochloride, became the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used in the antidepressant medication, Prozac. The drug, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1988, has revolutionized treatment for depression. In 1999, Schmiegel and Molloy were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and given the American Innovator Award. Throughout his career, Schmiegel garnered eighteen patents related to the synthesis of compounds.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Klaus Schmiegel was born in Chemitz, Germany on June 28, 1939. After he immigrated to the United States in 1951, Schmiegel received a B.S. in chemistry from the University of Michigan, an A.M. in organic chemistry from Dartmouth College, and a Ph.D in organic chemistry from Stanford University. His strong educational background secured him a prestigious position as a senior organic chemist at Eli Lilly, a prominent pharmaceutical company.
Primary accomplishment.
At Eli Lilly in the 1960s, scientists Klaus Schmiegel and Bryan Molloy, with the help of David Wong and Ray Fuller, searched for a compound to combat depression. Because depression and similar psychiatric disorders are associated with reduced serotonin levels, they focused their approach on prohibiting serotonin reuptake. During a regular nerve signal transmission, a neurotransmitter such as serotonin travels from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic neuron; the neurotransmitter returns to the presynaptic neuron after fulfilling its function, the reuptake process. Therefore, slowing and diminishing serotonin reuptake boosts serotonin levels in the brain. 
The scientists based their search on the template of the antihistamine drug diphenhydramine hydrochloride, commonly known as Benadryl. After many failures, the research team synthesized a group of compounds called aryloxyphenylpropylamines. Upon testing, a member of the group, fluoxetine hydrochloride, proved to affect only the neurotransmitter serotonin. This compound became the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and the active ingredient in the vastly popular and effective drug Prozac.
Prozac, the "Wonder Drug".
Eli Lilly recognized the potential of its new drug, but the company first tested it as a high blood pressure medication, an anti-obesity drug, and a remedy for severe depression. After those testing failures, Eli Lilly succeeded in treating five mildly depressed people; fluoxetine had found its niche. Eli Lilly announced its findings in 1974 and launched Prozac in 1987 after receiving FDA approval.
The “wonder drug” replaced earlier medications, tricyclic antidepressants, which were less effective with serious side effects such as headaches, blurred vision and hypertension. By 1999, Prozac was bringing in $2.5 billion per year, 25% of Eli Lilly’s revenue. The drug helped erase the stigma of depression, inspiring celebrities and public figures to flaunt rather than hide their sufferings.
Prozac, which is recognized by "Fortune" magazine as a “Product of the Century,” has few side effects; it has been widely beneficial for those suffering from depression, obsessive compulsive disorders, panic disorders, eating disorders and premenstrual dysphoric disorders. However, some contend that Prozac has been doled out too liberally—it has even been prescribed for animals. Peer drugs, including Zoloft and Paxil, which are also SSRIs, have experienced similar successes.
Unfortunately for Eli Lilly, its patent on Prozac expired in 2001, causing massive revenue losses. The company hopes to bounce back with its newest drug, Cymbalta, a painkiller and an antidepressant combined.
Other scientific work.
While Schmiegel is listed as an inventor on all eighteen of his patents, his patents are assigned to his company, Eli Lilly. As detailed by the list of patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office website, Schmiegel's chemical work concentrated on supplements to bolster the health of animals (growth promotion), weight control agents, and antidepressants.
Awards and recognition.
In 1999, both Schmiegel and Molloy were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for their fluoxetine compound that revolutionized depression treatment. In addition, the same year, the pair received the U.S. Department of Commerce's Ronald H. Brown American Innovator award, honoring their great contribution to society.
Later years.
Schmiegel worked for Eli Lilly until his retirement in 1993. Though Schmiegel is retired, he still lives in Indianapolis near the Eli Lilly headquarters.

Howstrake Camp Halt

Howstrake Camp (occasionally "Howstrake Holiday Camp Station", with or without the station suffix) is a stop on the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man located at the line's first summit on the climb from the terminus, before descending into the nearby valley.
Usage.
The station was used almost exclusively in conjunction with the nearby holiday camp from which it gained its name and despite the closure of the camp in 1985 remains open as a functioning request tram stop today. It also retains its original stone-built waiting shelter albeit in a poor state of repair, which has its name painted on the rear wall facing out to sea and bears the legend "Howstrake Holiday Camp Station" along its roof line. The building has been in a poor state of repair for a number of years. Originally the building was erected by and maintained by the owners of the holiday camp.
Today.
The station has remained nominally open in recent times since the closure of the adjacent holiday camp but facilities have not been maintained on site for many years. Tramcars do still stop here but only on request of passengers, or by flagging down a passing car to board. Being situated on an exposed coastal headland the shelter now provides welcome respite for walkers, the coastal road being a popular walk.
Locality.
Today the area is in a state of decay as can be seen from the dilapidated state of this once-grand entrance area. The station is something of an oddity, being that the shelter is on the "wrong side" compared to the entrance gates meaning that the road must be crossed between the two when there is in fact sufficient land for the shelter on the railway side of the road which is taken up by large entrance gates; upon first glance these gates appear to lead nowhere, but they actually once led to an underground tunnel which was the official entrance to the camp proper, located on the rocks below the tramlines, and the entrance point to the tunnel can be seen from the passing trams a few yards further down the line, noted by a substantial stone wall to the left of the running lines. The tunnel had however been sealed off since the closure of the camp, but the small toll cottage can still be made out in the undergrowth on the other side of the line.
Holiday Camp.
The camp itself sprawled across the hillside overlooking the Groudle Glen Railway on the adjacent hillside and some of the chalets remain today; the area is private property but reasonable views of it can be achieved from the outer terminus of the aforementioned railway, and some information about the site is also available here. The camp was first developed as a male-only tented village with all accommodation being in the form of distinctive looking bell tents. In the late 19th century it caused scandal by becoming the first camp on the island available to both sexes and it was operated by the same company that ran the enormously successful Cunningham's Camp in Douglas some four miles away. During the Second World War the camp was used as a music school by the Royal Naval School of Music before returning to holiday use upon cessation of the hostilities. Latterly it was a seasonal affair and after a fire ripped through the main dining hall in 1985 it closed.

Majestic Halt

Majestic Halt is a request stop on the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man and is the third stopping place on the line.
Origins.
The halt gains its name from the large Baillie Scott-designed hotel which was once located across the road from the tramlines. When the railway was first installed, the road which runs alongside was laid as well, but there was very little motor transport and the tram service provided the most popular link to this, one of the island's premier hotels.
Status.
The tram station was only ever denoted by a "Request Stop" board and no passenger facilities were provided until 1999 when, in line with management policy to provide passenger waiting facilities wherever possible, a modern shelter was erected, in conjunction with the bus services. Prior to this a simple park bench had sufficed as accommodation for over a century. Despite the closure, demolition and redevelopment of the nearby hotel, the station has remained open, albeit not appearing officially on timetables and literature.
Hotel.
The imposing Majestic Hotel that occupied the land now taken by exclusive apartments, was for many years a popular destination for tourists, being open to non-residents and boasting among other facilities, an outdoor swimming pool. Having declined in the 1980s it latterly served as an auction house prior to lying empty for some time before being razed to the ground to make way for the development that remains today.

Lasertank

Lasertank (also known as "Laser Tank") is a computer puzzle game requiring logical thinking to solve a variety of levels. It is open source and careware and can be used for free. The player must be able to concentrate and think ahead as in playing chess or checkers. Contradicting its name, "Lasertank" is in no way an action game. Although a player may try to solve a level quickly, there is no requirement to do so, so poor coordination and poor reflexes will not impede a player. Experience allows the player to learn a number of techniques and tricks that need to be used to solve difficult levels.
Gameplay.
"Lasertank" is played on a 16 x 16 grid. The player must use the tank to reach a flag in every level without "dying". The player can move the tank in four directions and can fire a laser that is used to move or destroy objects. The amount of moves and shots it takes to complete a level are recorded in a high score list. The scores are then compared with the current "Global High Score" file.
Expansion.
Thousands of new levels can be downloaded. A level editor is available that has enabled players to create thousands of new levels. Players may upload their new levels for others to download and solve. Other tools are available that have enabled players to create many new LTG (LaserTank Graphics) visual themes. A setup tool for assisting in the updating of the game is also available, and is useful in that it keeps track of high scores and level modifications contained in downloaded updates. A number of other applications and downloads are available at the official "Lasertank" website.
Genres (level types).
The variety of objects within the game enables the creation of a great variety of levels. Easy levels are grouped into a "Beginner" collection for younger or less-skilled players. Typical levels of varying difficulty are grouped into a series of "Challenge" collections. There is also a collection of levels requiring the pushing of blocks around, resembling another computer puzzle game called Sokoban.
Another "Special" collection contains unconventional levels that are not typical of the game. Some may be repetitive. Other levels have been created that are machine-like, or function as virtual computers that perform simple mathematical calculations or sequential tasks. Some of these so-called special levels may only serve as demonstrations or artwork, and may not even be solvable since they may require more shots or moves than the game can record.
There are also collections of downloadable tutorial levels that have been created to demonstrate the many tips and tricks of "Lasertank" to help other players learn the details of gameplay.
Languages.
The Lasertank Translation Kit can be used to create language kits in order to play "Lasertank" in languages other than the default English. The following language kits are currently available:
Lasertank community and forum.
There is an online Yahoo! "Lasertank" group that provides game support. Help can be requested from other players and downloadable documents are also available. "Lasertank" gameplay, level editing, occasional new game versions, as well as a wide variety of other topics are discussed.
History.
"Lasertank" was created by Jim Kindley (JEK Software) who started writing "Lasertank" in 1995. Kindley's main goal was to make the game for free, but have people all over the world send levels to add to it. Kindley is not currently involved with "Lasertank", but has stated "Maybe someday I will re-enter the world of LaserTank". Donald Drouin of Canada is now the official "Lasertank" manager who gathers new levels and regularly updates the official "Lasertank" website, as well as providing interesting statistics to other players regarding current records and high scores.

<doc id="20279863" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20279863" title="Nicholas Ribich">
Nicholas Ribich

An ethnic Serb, Nikola "Nicholas" Ribich was born in Alberta, Canada and fought in the Bosnian Serb Army for several years. In 1995, he took four United Nations peacekeepers hostage and used them as a human shield to try to force a halt to the ongoing bombing of Bosnia by NATO forces.
He was the first Canadian to be prosecuted for a hostage-taking committed outside the country.
In Serbia.
Ribich travelled to Serbia in 1992, ostensibly because he "want to fight Muslims". There he joined the Bosnian Serb Army as a volunteer.
On May 24, 1995, British General Rupert Smith, leading a United Nations contingent, warned both the Bosnians and Serbs in Pale to cease street fighting and shelling, or risk an air strike from NATO aircraft. The Serbian faction ignored the warning, and was hit by a retaliatory airstrike which dropped two bombs on their base ten kilometres south of the city the next day.
The day after the bombs were dropped, it is alleged that Ribich and other Bosnian Serbs walked into the United Nations office with AK-47s and took several staff members hostage, including Russians Capt. Zidlik and Capt. Pavel Teterevsk, and Canadian Capt. Patrick Rechner. They demanded that Major Guy Lavender phone Smith, and subsequently warned the General that bombing of Serb targets had to cease or the hostages would be killed.
The hostages were taken to the Serbian base south of the city, where Rechner was handcuffed to a lightning rod outside a warehouse being used to store mortar rounds. Ribich then allegedly phoned the United Nations and warned that "The three UN observers are at the site of the warehouse. Any more bombings, they'll be the first to go.".
The prisoners were noted to have been "treated well" during their confinement, and were voluntarily returned to the United Nations office on June 18.
In Canada.
The majority of Serbs perceived the Nichlas Ribich case this way: Politics can manifest itself in many ways for those who are born in Canada and yet feel kinship for their ancestral home and people, let alone those who are not. Ribich had to choose one country over another. He made a conscientious decision, but got caught in the maelstorm of war and uncertainty, trying to make sense of the chaos that surrounded him in both the country of his birth and his ancestral homeland.
The Canadian Government, of course, saw it differently.
Arrest and trial.
In 2000, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police traced Ribich down to his new home in Germany, and he was arrested in February. Nine months later, he was extradited to face charges in Canada, where he was defended by lawyer D'Arcy DePoe. Here Ribich was facing four charges of hostage taking under Canadian law for his alleged involvement to prevent air strikes by NATO on Bosnian Serb enclaves during the NATO bombing of Bosnia in May 1995. The Canadian Criminal Code was amended in 1989 to allow for prosecutions of hostage-taking committed abroad, but this was believed to be the first time a Canadian was being prosecuted under this new provision, which provided for maximum sentence of life in prison, if found guilty.
His trial began in October 2002, However, the trial unraveled three months later when judge Douglas Cunningham of the Ontario Supreme Court declared a mistrial on 20 January 2003, after only nine days of testimony.
Ribich was later tried again in 2005 for hostage taking and allegedly threatening death. His layer, D'Arcy DePoe, called it ""one of the most unusual criminal trials in Canadian history"" as it was the first time a Canadian had been tried in this manner. "While this is an unusual form of trespass, it is submitted that NATO dropping 2,000-pound bombs on this property was clearly a trespass." This time, there was no mistrial declared and Ribich was convicted. Two witnesses from the Canadian Forces, known only as Witness A and Witness B, were only allowed to testify by transcript during Ribich's 2005 trial. D'Arcy objeced to this but to no avail.

It'll Never Work

"It'll Never Work" was a television programme for children showcasing new inventions and developments in scientific technology. Produced by Roy Milani for BBC Children's, the show ran for seven series between 9 November 1993 and 23 August 1999 on weekdays within the Children's BBC, later CBBC, strand on BBC One. "It'll Never Work" was presented throughout its run by children's television presenter Sally Gray, who would go on to present children's quiz "50/50", Jez Nelson, who would go on to front the related primetime BBC technology series "Tomorrow's World", and science presenter Angela Lamont. This team was augmented during later series by presenters Adrian Johnson (series 5, 1997) and Rick Adams (series 6, 1998).
For each episode the presenters travelled worldwide to discover new gadgets and to test out whether new inventions worked or not, hence the show's title. Depeche Mode's 1984 hit single "People Are People" was used as the theme music.
The show was critically and commercially lauded, winning the 1994 BAFTA TV Award in the category of 'Best Children's Programme (Factual)' for Roy Milani, and nominated again in the same category the following year. The series moreover achieved ratings of up to four million viewers.
Series.
There were seven series of "It'll Never Work" produced in total, all appearing on BBC One. The first six series each consisted of six episodes of 25 minutes length and were screened as part of Children's BBC's autumn season, running on Tuesday afternoons in the six weeks before school Christmas holidays. The final series in 1999 comprised only five episodes and was screened on Mondays as part of CBBC's line-up for school summer holidays. All episodes premiered in the 4:35pm slot preceding "Newsround".
Design Awards.
The third series introduced a competition for young inventors to submit ideas to the "It'll Never Work" Design Awards. The first awards ceremony was televised from the Science Museum in London on 17 March 1996, with the judging panel including astronomer Patrick Moore. This segment returned in the same form a year later on 16 March 1997, featuring Kevin Warwick.

Last Evenings on Earth

Last Evenings on Earth ("Llamadas Telefonicas" in Spanish) is a collection of short stories by the Chilean author Roberto Bolaño, published in 1997 with a translation into English by Chris Andrews published in 2006. The stories in this volume were selected from two Spanish language collections, "Llamadas Telefonicas" (1997), and "Putas Asesinas" (2001). The remaining stories in these two collections were later gathered in "The Return".
Summary.
Set amid the diaspora of Chilean exiles in Latin America and Europe, the fourteen stories in "Last Evenings on Earth" are peopled by Bolaño's beloved "failed generation" and demonstrate the complexities of and Latin American identity and history. The narrators are usually writers grappling with private (and often unlucky) quests, speaking in the first person as if giving a deposition—like witnesses to a crime. These protagonists tend to take detours and narrate unresolved efforts. They are characters living at the margins. Other stories find themselves narrated in the third person by the author "B.", which is one of many cases of Bolaño writing himself into his own fiction.
The Stories.
"Sensini".
The unnamed narrator comes in fourth in a short story contest. In the collection of finalists, he reads a story by Luis Antonio Sensini. He begins a correspondence with the much-older writer. When Sensini moves back to Argentina, the two stop writing each other. After Sensini dies, his daughter Miranda visits the narrator.
"A Literary Adventure".
The author B writes a book which includes a mocking portrayal of another, and far more famous, author - A. to B's surprise A writes a positive review of B's book, and B is left to wonder the possible implications of this. After a second book by B receives a long, considered and insightful review by A, B decides that he has to meet him.
"The Grub".
17 year old Arturo Belano spends his days in Mexico City browsing bookstores and watching movies. He strikes up an odd friendship with a man, whom he calls "the grub" ("El Gusano") who sits on the same bench every day, doing nothing. The character of the grub, "with his straw hat and a Bali cigarette hanging from his bottom lip" is also the subject of Bolaño's poem of the same name ("El Gusano" in Spanish, though translated as "the Worm" rather than "the Grub" in Laura Healy's translation of "The Romantic Dogs")
"Gómez Palacio".
A 23 year old poet becomes a creative writing teacher in the town of Gómez Palacio and goes on a strange car-ride with the director of the writing program.
"Last Evenings On Earth".
a Chilean father and his son vacation in Acapulco and visit a whorehouse bar, where they get into a fight. Giles Harvey named this story, along with the title story of "The Return", as "the greatest things Bolaño ever wrote".
"Dance Card".
The narrator returns from Mexico to Chile in 1973 "to help build socialism;" he is arrested during a road check and imprisoned for being a "Mexican terrorist" but released a few days later thanks to a pair of former classmates who had become police detectives.

Serena Ortolani

Serena Ortolani (born on January 7, 1987 in Ravenna) is an Italian volleyball player.
She has played plays as an opposite hitter for Foppapedretti Bergamo from 2008 to 2011. Despite being of a young age, Ortolani has already made several appearances for the Italian national volleyball team in international competitions and is considered by numerous experts to being one of the biggest promises of Italian women's volleyball. Her debut for the national team came on the 2005 edition of the European Championships, held in Croatia, when the team was then coached by Marco Bonitta. In the 2005/06 season, she won her first Coppa Italia and Scudetto with Foppapedretti Bergamo. In 2006, she was selected again for the national team for the 2006 FIVB Women's World Championship, held in Japan, where she helped Italy win fourth place. She began the 2006/2007 season for Bergamo, but after the first half of the season, she was loaned to Rebecchi Piacenza, to improve her game further. In 2007, she helped the Italian volleyball team win the Women's European Volleyball Championship, held in Belgium and Luxembourg and repeated this success a few months later at the World Cup in Japan, thereby helping Italy gain qualification for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where she subsequently competed.
She won the 2008–09 CEV Indesit Champions League playing with Volley Bergamo and was awarded "Most Valuable Player".

<doc id="20279982" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20279982" title="Hemoglobin E">
Hemoglobin E

Hemoglobin E or haemoglobin E (HbE) is an abnormal hemoglobin with a single point mutation in the β chain. At position 26 there is a change in the amino acid, from glutamic acid to lysine. Hemoglobin E has been one of the less well known variants of normal hemoglobin. It is very common in Southeast Asia but has a low frequency amongst other races. HbE can be detected on electrophoresis.
The βE mutation affects β-gene expression creating an alternate splicing site in the mRNA at codons 25-27 of the β-globin gene. Through this mechanism, there is a mild deficiency in normal β mRNA and production of small amounts of anomalous β mRNA. The reduced synthesis of β chain may cause β-thalassemia. Also, this hemoglobin variant has a weak union between α- and β-globin, causing instability when there is a high amount of oxidant.
Hemoglobin E disease (EE).
Hemoglobin E disease results when the offspring inherits the gene for HbE from both parents. At birth, babies homozygous for the hemoglobin E allele do not present symptoms due to HbF (fetal hemoglobin) they still have. In the first months of life, fetal hemoglobin disappears and the amount of hemoglobin E increases, so the subjects start to have a mild β-thalassemia. People who are heterozygote for hemoglobin E (one normal allele and one abnormal allele) do not show any symptoms (there is usually no anemia or hemolysis). Subjects homozygous for the hemoglobin E allele (two abnormal alleles) have a mild hemolytic anemia and mild splenomegaly.
Hemoglobin E trait: heterozygotes for HbE (AE).
Heterozygous AE occurs when the gene for haemoglobin E is inherited from one parent and the gene for hemoglobin A from the other. This is called hemoglobin E trait, and it is not a disease. People who have hemoglobin E trait (heterozygous) are asymptomatic and their state does not usually result in health problems. They may have a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and very abnormal red blood cells (target cells). Its clinical relevance is exclusively due to the potential for transmitting E or β-thalassemia. 
Heterozygotes for HbE (SE).
Compound heterozygotes with hemoglobin sickle E disease result when the gene of hemoglobin E is inherited from one parent and the gene for hemoglobin S from the other. As the amount of fetal hemoglobin decreases and hemoglobin S increases, a mild hemolytic anemia appears in the early stage of development.
Hemoglobin E/β-thalassaemia.
People who have hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia have inherited one gene for hemoglobin E from one parent and one gene for β-thalassemia from the other parent. Hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia is a severe disease, and it still has no universal cure. It affects more than a million people in the world. The consequences of hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia when it is not treated can be heart failure, the enlargement of the liver, problems in the bones, etc.
There is a variety of genotypes depending on the interaction of HbE and α-thalassemia. The presence of the α-thalassemia reduces the amount of HbE usually found in HbE heterozygotes. In other cases, in combination with certain thalassemia mutations, it provides an increased resistance to malaria ("P. falciparum").
Epidemiology.
Hemoglobin E is most prevalent in Southeast Asia (Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam), where its prevalence can reach 30 or 40%, and North-East India, where in certain areas carrier rates reach 60% of the population. In Thailand the mutation can reach 50 or 70%, and it is higher in the North-East of the country. It is also found in China, the Philippines, Turkey, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, etc. The mutation is estimated to have arisen within the last 5,000 years. In Europe there have been found cases of families with hemoglobin E, but in these cases, the mutation differs from the one found in South-East Asia. This means that there may be different origins of the βE mutation.

Kálmán Kubinyi

Kálmán Mátyás Béla Kubinyi (June 29, 1906 Cleveland – September 3, 1973 Stockbridge, Massachusetts) was an influential etcher, engraver and enamelist and a member of the so-called Cleveland School, a number of relatively prominent artists in Northeast Ohio that existed from about 1910 to 1960.
Kubinyi was a modernist whose interpretations of the machine age through “ash can” subjects and industrial scenes often bear the stamp of Social Realism. His work was widely exhibited throughout the 1930s, including at the Venice Biennale (1937) and the New York World's Fair (1939).
Biography.
As a child he attended art classes taught by William Zorach, later graduating from the Cleveland School of Art in 1926 and briefly engaging in further art studies in Munich.
Kubinyi supervised the graphic arts division of the Works Progress Administration in Cleveland from 1935 until 1939, when the W.P.A. named him to head the entire Cleveland W.P.A. arts project. During the 1930s, Kubinyi reportedly engaged in politics as a member of the Communist Party USA, and taught printmaking at the Cleveland School of Art (now the Cleveland Institute of Art), the Cleveland Museum of Art and the John Huntington Polytechnic Institute.
Kubinyi founded the Cleveland Print Makers in 1930 and served as its president for 11 years. In 1932, the group established the "Print-a-Month" series, the first of its kind in visual art, and apparently modeled on the 1926 Book-of-the-Month Club. For an annual fee of $10, subscribers received a monthly etching, lithograph or woodcut. Artists obtained $50 for each commission, printed in signed editions limited to 250 impressions. Contributors included Emil Ganso, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Rockwell Kent, Kubinyi and many others during the series' five-year life span. Considering inflation, the $50 commission fee in 1932 might be worth about $752 in 2007 according to one calculation.
Between 1930 and 1948 Kubinyi took top prizes on five occasions at the Cleveland Museum of Art's May Show, an annual event which helped to define the Cleveland School over much of its life. He exhibited at the show in various media over a nearly 30-year period, beginning in 1928.
At age the age of 27, Kubinyi married Doris Hall (1907–2000) a successful artist in her own right, who first trained as a painter with Charles Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and later at the Cleveland School of Art where she graduated in 1929. While studying in Cleveland, she met Kubinyi who was teaching printmaking. They later collaborated on a long and successful career in enameling beginning in the 1940s. The couple had two children. Their son, Laszlo Kubinyi became a great Illustrator as well. Their Daughter, Moisha married the illustrator R.O. Blechman. His grand daughter Natalia Kubinyi also is an Illustrator, who now goes by the name of Natalia Aura Tova Kadish.
Kubinyi reportedly once said of their collaboration, "Control of color, design and most of the application of the enamel is done by Doris. I beat out the large sculptural forms, the metal forming, fabrication, ground coats, compounding of enamels, spraying and burning of undercoats. I take the brunt of the preparation."
During the 1940s, Kubinyi and his wife opened a gallery and studio in Gloucester, Massachusetts. They later opened a studio/gallery in downtown Boston, and finally a studio in Stockbridge, where Kubinyi also directed the art department for Hans Maeder's Stockbridge School.
Today Kubinyi’s work is found in various private collections and in several museums and other public venues, including the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Kelvin Smith Library at Case Western Reserve University, the Western Reserve Historical Society and the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. Three 1957 enamel works depicting signs of the Zodiac, are installed on the exterior of Michigan State University's Brody Dormitories. These three works are primarily by Doris Hall, but with contributions from Kubinyi. As of 2009, the Brody works appeared to be in need of maintenance. "The Goldsmith of Florence: A Book of Great Craftsmen" and a few other volumes were illustrated by Kubinyi.

Father Goose's Year Book

"Father Goose's Year Book: Quaint Quacks and Feathered Shafts for Mature Children" is a collection of humorous nonsense poetry written by L. Frank Baum, author of the Oz books. It was published in 1907.
The book was illustrated by Walter J. Enright; he was the husband of Maginel Wright Enright, the artist who illustrated Baum's "The Twinkle Tales" (1906), "Policeman Bluejay" (1907), and "L. Frank Baum's Juvenile Speaker" (1910).
As its title indicates, "Father Goose's Year Book" was an attempt to capitalize on the prior success of "", the 1899 collaboration between Baum and W. W. Denslow that was the dominant best-seller in children's literature at the turn of the twentieth century. Baum had made similar attempts, with uneven results; "The Songs of Father Goose" (1900) had been a respectable seller, but other ventures, including a "Father Goose Calendar", failed to materialize. The "Year Book" was a belated version of the calendar: it was a date book with humorous poems and pictures on the left (the verso side of each leaf), faced with blank pages on the right (the recto side) for making notes.
Baum's poems for the collection are similar to his verses in the original "Father Goose", but aimed at adults (the "mature children" of the subtitle). The "Year Book" was described as "the first book for grown-ups by the author of "The Wizard of Oz", "Ozma of Oz", etc." Unfortunately, Baum's rhymes in the "Year Book" are tainted with the racial and ethnic prejudices and stereotypes of his era; indeed, it is this aspect of the book that is most striking to a modern sensibility. This problem of ethics and taste is probably insurmountable for modern readers; it is not surprising that the book was not reprinted in the century after its publication.

Jimi Hendrix posthumous discography

At the time of his death on September 18, 1970, American musician Jimi Hendrix left behind a large body of unreleased recordings in varying stages of completion. Over the years, his producers and record companies have continued to issue his music in various formats. Since Experience Hendrix, a family company, took control of his recording legacy in 1997, over 15 Hendrix albums have appeared in the main U.S. "Billboard" magazine's Top 200 albums chart. Several of these have also placed in charts in more than 18 countries around the world.
Besides compilations and live albums, several attempts have been made to complete the album that he was working on when he died. With several proposed titles, including "First Rays of the New Rising Sun", it was to be Hendrix's fourth studio album and the first after the breakup of the Jimi Hendrix Experience and the short-lived Band of Gypsys. He was working on enough material for a double album and sketched out possible track lists, although only about six songs were nearing completion, with an additional twenty or so in different stages of development. Released as "The Cry of Love" in 1971, it reached number three in "Billboard"'s album chart; as 1995's "Voodoo Soup" it appeared at number 66; and the latest iteration, "First Rays of the New Rising Sun", reached number 49 in 1997.
After his death, Hendrix's record companies Reprise Records in the U.S. and Track Records in the UK continued to issue his albums. These comprise demos, studio outtakes/alternate takes, jams, and live recordings. MCA Records took over in 1992, during the controversial tenure of subsequent producer Alan Douglas. In 2010, Sony/Legacy Recordings became the label that handles releases produced by Experience Hendrix. 
In addition to legitimate releases, a large number of bootleg and gray market albums have appeared over the years. Many of these have been re-released several times with different album titles, packaging, and song titles; some purporting to feature Hendrix as a sideman have been shown to be fake. To meet the demand, Dagger Records was established to issue "official bootlegs" of albums "that don't meet the technical recording criteria" and standards for mainstream release. These have included live recordings from various points in his career as well as demo and rehearsal recordings.

Isaac de Porthau

Isaac de Porthau (also Portau or Portaut; January 30, 1617, Pau – July 13, 1712) was a Gascon black musketeer of the Maison du Roi in 17th century France. In addition, he was the first cousin once removed of the Comte de Troisville, captain of the Musketeers of the Guard, and first cousin of Armand d'Athos. Porthau served as the inspiration for Alexandre Dumas's character "Porthos" in the d'Artagnan Romances.
Life.
Born in Béarn to Isaac de Porthau de Camptort de Campagne de Castetbon (Secretary of the Parliament of Béarn) and Clémence de Brosser, as the eldest of four children: Jean, Jeanne, and Sarah. His brother Jean also became a black musketeer, and may be in part responsible for the fictional representations of Porthau.
Porthau served in the company of Alexandre de Essarts, cousin of the Comte de Troisville, before joining the Musketeers of the Guard in 1642. He had two sons: Arnaud and Jean.
Following his father's death in 1654, he resigned from the Guard and took over as Secretary of the Parliament of Béarn. He died of a stroke on July 13, 1712, and was buried in the Chapelle du Saint-Sacrement in the church of St. Martin, Pau.
Pedigree and arms.
According to an issue of "Macmillan's Magazine" from 1899:
The Porthaus were an ancient family of Béarn, taking their name from one of the old "porthaux" or "portes" (small frontier towers resembling the peel-towers of the British Border) with which the French and Spanish Pyrénées were studded.
Clearly the Porthaus accepted this interpretation of their name, since the blazon of their arms (without tinctures, as the source is a seal) was: A lion rampant and in chief two towers crenellated, masoned and inflamed, one to the dexter and the other to the sinister.
These arms were granted to the Porthaus on November 24, 1674. It is unrecorded what, if anything, their arms were prior to this date.

Port Jack Halt

Port Jack Halt is the name of the first official stopping place on the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man and is situated a short distance from the terminus.
Environs.
Today, the site is known for being the location of the chip shop of the same name, but in the busy tourist days of the island it was a popular stopping off point for visitors on their way to the White City located a few yards along the coast. It remains open today but is only demarkated by a small bus stop-type sign fitted to one of the green overhead poles. The site is also served by the island's Bus Vannin service. Whilst never appearing in the railway's timetables or scheduling, the halt has long been established as a dropping-off point for local traffic and tramcars stop on either side of the road that bisects the railway at this point, either on the southerly side outside the chip shop, or the northerly which directly leads to a set of public conveniences.
Douglas Bay Hotel and development into Skandia House.
The station was once the closest to the Douglas Bay Hotel which dominated the skyline until gutted by a devastating fire in 1988. The hotel was the focal point of the headland and built from red brick with a tower at its centre; it was famous for the Texas Bar, a Wild West-themed saloon that was open to both residents and non-residents. In latter years, a small swimming pool was built in the grounds nearby to the passing tramlines. 
Skandia House opened on the site on 31st January 2003 following development by Dandara. The redevelopment of the site included digging down into the rock to facilitate the space for an underground carpark. The primary tennant of the four floor building from opening has been Royal Skandia Life Assurance, a company who had a presence on the island in various guises for the previous 20 years. In 2005, Royal Skandia sub-let a small unoccupied floor of the office to Poker Stars who were moving their business from the warm Caribbean to the middle of the cold Irish Sea for tax and reputational reasons. In 2012 Poker Stars purchased the building to help reassure their permanent residency on the island to external parties. By this stage PokerStars has purchased the Guernsey based Full Tilt Poker to consolidate themselves as the largest online poker company in the world. The PR for this circled around the Isle of Man Chief Minister Allan Bell toasting sparkling wine in the reception of Skandia House. Skandia International (renamed since the Skandia business was in 2006 by the FTSE100 company Old Mutual) remain the primary tennant of the building for the foreseeable future employing over 300 people in two thirds of the building space. PokerStars employ around 200 people in the remaining space (including reclaimed and converted carpark spaces) within Skandia House.
A large stone sign at the entry of the building confirms the name of the building as Skandia House however Poker Stars have always referred to the building as the grand "Douglas Bay Complex".
A circular tower was incorporated into the design of horse shoe shape building, both slightly echoing the hotel structure it replaced. The staff restroom in Skandia House was called the "Texas Bar" to also recall the previous occupancy of the site. A smart redevelopment of the restroom in 2012 by PokerStars led to the name unimaginatively being changed to "The Ocean".
Facilities.
The area was once a bustling place for tourists to visit and featured a penny amusement arcade with slot machines and the like, a milk bar known as the "Moo Kow" and other shops that traded in souvenirs and the like. Being above a stony beach of the same name, previously known as "Port-E-Vada Creek" the shops traded largely in seaside equipment as one would expect. The distinctive Mock Tudor-style buildings remain today, now location for a tanning shop, tapas bar and the famous "Port Jack Chippie" chip shop; in the terrace behind is a convenience store and hairdressers' salon. It was once a busy area for tourists, with many of the buildings that now form private dwellings or apartments being bed-and-breakfasts or guest houses.

Press Start -Symphony of Games-

Press Start -Symphony of Games- is a series of Japanese video game music concerts introduced in 2006. It was initiated by several industry professionals and is sponsored by the Japanese publishing company Enterbrain.
Development.
Inspired by the big success of earlier events, such as the Orchestral Game Music Concerts and the Symphonic Game Music Concerts, several industry professionals collaborated to create a new Japanese game concert series. In 2006, conductor Taizo Takemoto, game designer Masahiro Sakurai, scenario writer Kazushige Nojima and composers Nobuo Uematsu and Shogo Sakai formed an executive committee to develop "Press Start". Hoping to distinguish the performances from foreign concerts and making it better than the other series, Uematsu preferred to select only music from Japanese games, though "Press Start" was always designed not to be limited to just one game series or console.
Press Start 2006 -Symphony of Games-.
Date: September 22
Venue: Bunkamura Orchard Hall
Conductor: Taizo Takemoto
Orchestra: Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra
"Press Start 2006" marked the first Japanese orchestral performance of music from various game series after the ten-year hiatus following the "Orchestral Game Music Concert 5". The event took place one day before the Tokyo Game Show opened for the public and was presented by Rie Tanaka, with Sakurai and Uematsu joining her as commentators. Additionally, every track featured guest appearances of the respective composers telling an anecdote from the time they composed that specific soundtrack. The executive committee expressed its satisfaction with the concert afterwards and announced there were plans for another event at a bigger concert hall in 2007.
Press Start 2007 -Symphony of Games-.
Date and venue (Yokohama): September 17, Pacifico Yokohama
Date and venue (Osaka): September 22, Umeda Arts Theater
Conductor: Taizo Takemoto
Orchestra: Press Start Gadget Orchestra and Press Start 2007 Chorus
Due to positive reactions and support from fans, the series was expanded to offer two performances in Yokohama and Osaka, allowing more people to attend the event in 2007. Both concerts featured exclusive tracks that were not performed at the other venue and were accompanied by game footage on a big screen. "Press Start 2007" was presented by Chisa Yokoyama.
Press Start 2008 -Symphony of Games-.
Date and venue (Tokyo): September 14, Bunkamura Orchard Hall
Date and venue (Shanghai): October 31, Shanghai International Gymnastic Center
Conductor: Taizo Takemoto
Orchestra: Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra
In 2008, the series expanded again to hold one concert in Tokyo and one in Shanghai, China. Both performances were presented by Keiko Washino. The event in China dropped some of the new arrangements and replaced them with tracks from earlier "Press Start" concerts.
Press Start 2009 -Symphony of Games-.
Date: August 2
Venue: Tokyo Metropolitan Art Space
Two concerts were held at the same venue in the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo, with one performance beginning in the early afternoon and the other one in the evening.

Xmove

xmove is a computer program that allows the movement of X Window System applications between different displays and the persistence of X applications across X server restarts. It solves a problem in the design of X, where an X client (an X application) is tied to the X server (X display) it was started on for its lifetime. Also, if the X server is shut down, the client application is forced to stop running.
xmove lets the client disconnect from its current X server, and connect to a new one, at any time. The transition is completely transparent to the client. xmove works by acting as a proxy between the client and server. It is a "pseudoserver" which stores enough server state so that clients can connect to a new server without being disrupted.

The Romantic Dogs

The Romantic Dogs ("Los perros románticos" in Spanish) is a collection of poems by the Chilean author Roberto Bolaño. It was published in 2006. The bilingual edition, with English translations by Laura Healy, was published by New Directions in 2008. 
These 43 poems span nearly twenty years, from 1980 to 1998, embracing a wide variety of topics. Bolaño's obsession with detectives is evident in several poems, but the collection suggests other preoccupations, as in the poem "Godzilla in Mexico."
Reception.
According to Charles Bainbridge, writing for The Guardian:
"The collection is dominated by a series of sustained reminiscences, fuelled by rage and a sense of cornered idealism [...] at key moments the writing pitches a kind of visionary anger. Bolaño seems most at home when describing the sparse Mexican towns near the border with the US [...] and much of the best writing evokes characters, such as "The Worm" or "Lupe", who inhabit this violent world. But the book ends on a very different note with two sudden love poems – lyrical, even gentle – that celebrate the possibility of a kind of salvation"
Sarah Kerr, writing for "The New York Review of Books" found the poems to be "wonderfully unreserved" while Boyd Tonkin of "The Independent" states that Bolaño "can sound like a Whitman-esque visionary, as in "The Last Savage", or erotically star-struck, as with "La Francesa" and her love "brief as the sigh of a guillotined head", or lyrically touching, recalling teenage hooker "Lupe" and her lost baby."

Alexander Ramsay (architect)

Alexander Ramsay ("circa" 1777 – 18 May 1847) was a Scottish builder and architect, born in Edinburgh. He rebuilt Craigend Castle, near Milngavie, for James Smith of Craigend, in a Gothic revival style. Craigend was built on land that Smith's father had purchased from the Duke of Montrose, and which formerly formed part of the Mugdock Castle estate. The house was completed in 1812, but was gutted and partly demolished in 1968. The ruins form a picturesque part of Mugdock Country Park.
There is a memorial stone in Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh, recording Ramsay's death on 18 May 1847.

Joseph White (psychologist)

Joseph L. White is Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of California, Irvine and "godfather" of the field of Black Psychology.
Early Life and Family.
Joseph White was born on October 19, 1932 in Lincoln, Nebraska to Dorothy Lee and Joseph L. White. At a very young age his family moved to Minneapolis where they remained until White's mother sent him to San Francisco to live with his aunt after completing high school. White only dreamed of becoming a waiter but his aunt suggested that he go to college. His first wife and mother to his three children, Lori, Lisa, and Lynn, was Myrtle Escort White. His second wife of over thirty years is Lois White.
Education.
Joseph White received his BA from San Francisco State University, and his PhD in clinical psychology at Michigan State University in 1961. When he went to San Francisco State the total cost of admission for him was $14.25. College was so affordable at that time in California that if a student did not have the money at that moment the student could sign a waiver promising to pay the current tuition and fees the next semester. White was always a good athlete in high school and that earned him a job working at a playground in a city neighborhood. This is where he found his love for psychology. Ivan Pavlov was an influential psychologist for White and he was very interested in learning about the unconscious mind. This would probably be his earliest influence in regards to psychology.
 After he finished at San Francisco State White served 24 months in the military. He did not immediately get accepted into graduate school. Luckily San Francisco State was creating a Master’s program and agreed to admit him to the program and help him gain admission to a doctorate program. Two years later, he was accepted at Michigan State.
 White recalls the reactions of people in psychology to him as hesitant since he was the only Negro at the program. People did not think that Negro students had the advanced capacity to do graduate level work. He attempted to get some of his required classes waived because of his work at San Francisco State but Michigan State would not honor this request. He was well rounded and took many classes in his major at San Francisco and as a result ended up at the top of his class at Michigan State.
Career.
While his main field of study was clinical psychology, Dr. White focused a lot of his attention on aiding and supporting disadvantaged students of color in their path to acquire knowledge by developing curriculum that caters to the needs of students of color. In his quest to reform the education system, White rejects the use of white middle class norms in determining the standards of education. While at California State University, Long Beach, White helped in establishing the Educational Opportunities Program (EOP) which became a program implemented across the California State University campuses.
In 1968, White helped found the Association of Black Psychologists along with a few other Black Psychologists during the 1968 conference of the American Psychological Association. "We cannot depend on them to define us. We have to take charge and define ourselves. We need to build our own psychology." This quote was a result of the meeting of those few Black Psychologists who saw a need for change in how psychology is applied to Blacks. During this same time, while serving as a professor and dean of undergraduate studies, White yielded to the needs of the students in helping to establish the first Black Studies Program during the 1968 strike at San Francisco State University.
In addition to his research, Joseph White is a professor who has been a practicing psychologist as well as a consultant. White has worked as a psychologist to five hospitals and three clinics in Southern California and over the years has served as a consultant for school districts, universities, private organizations, drug prevention programs, and government agencies.
Toward a Black Psychology.
Joseph White's 1970 article "Toward a Black Psychology", published in Ebony Magazine, was a seminal document in the formation of African-American Psychology as a professional field and the rise of ethnic and cultural psychology. The article argued that whatever the future of race relations and the destiny of black people, the creation of a Black Psychology was necessary because the psychology created by white people could never adequately apply to African-Americans. Dr. White went further to point out that the application of mainstream white psychology to black people resulted in weakness-oriented deficit finding, rather than an accurate appraisal of the situation of people of African descent.
Awards.
In 1994 Dr. White was awarded a Citation of Achievement in Psychology and Community Service from President Bill Clinton. Dr. White was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Minnesota in 2007.Joseph White is Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of California, Irvine where he spent most of his career. Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. appointed White as chairman to the California State Psychology Licensing Board where he served for three years and he is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas. On May 23, 2008, Joseph L. White was honored as Alumnus of the year at San Francisco State University. White is also the recipient of the honorary degree Doctor of Laws from the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota. This is the highest award given to individuals who are distinguished for their accomplishment in cultural affairs, public service or a field of knowledge and scholarship.

Multiculturalism without Culture

Multiculturalism without Culture is a book written by Anne Phillips. The topic of multiculturalism is explored by Phillips with reference to such subjects as Feminism, Anthropology, Political Theory, Law, and Philosophy. Her inspiration to write the book stemmed from the contrasting concerns of multiculturalism challenging the rights of women and feminism encroaching upon the well-being of cultures. While Phillips presents many different perspectives on multiculturalism, her general argument in the book can be summed up as: “It is time for elaborating a version of multiculturalism that dispenses with reified notions of culture, engages more ruthlessly with cultural stereotypes, and refuses to subordinate the rights and interests of women to the supposed traditions of their culture.”
Summary.
In the book, Phillips elaborates on the idea of a multiculturalism without culture. In this model, the conception of culture as unchanging and domineering (A view that Phillips argues is held by many governments and people alike) is disposed in favor of the idea that culture is fluid and that the individual in the culture, not the culture group itself, has rights and is the most important element. A central part of her theory rests on the idea that people in minority cultures have autonomy. Her discussion weighs many different perspectives on multiculturalism provided by an array of modern writers on the subject. She consistently keeps feminist theory as a primary foundation from which she structures her arguments. The book ends with her vouching for the increasing of consultative services for minority groups and increase of dialogue between them and governments.

Ed Callahan

Edgar F. Callahan (March 23, 1929 – March 18, 2009) was an American civil servant, who served as Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) under President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1985.
Early life and career.
Born in Youngstown, Ohio, Callahan graduated from Ursuline High School in 1946. He went on to play college football at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he received a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1951 and a master's degree in educational administration in 1952.
From 1970 - 1975, Callahan was principal of Boylan Catholic High School, and in 1971 he became the first superintendent of the Rockford Area Catholic Schools. Prior to this, Callahan served a variety of positions at Boylan, including the first athletic director, first head coach in football, basketball, and chair of the mathematics department.
In 1975, Callahan became the Assistant Secretary of State for Illinois under Secretary Michael Howlett.
Immediately prior to his presidential appointment, Callahan served as director of the Illinois Department of Financial Institutions under Governor James R. Thompson. As director, he was responsible for the supervision of 2,000 consumer finance companies, 1,200 currency exchanges, and 1,000 Illinois-chartered credit unions.
Chairman of the NCUA.
In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed Callahan as Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, which made him the highest-ranking credit union regulator in the country.
As chairman of the NCUA, Callahan was one of the president's key advisors on domestic economic policy. He is credited with guiding the credit union movement into deregulation, allowing it to take flight.
Callahan made three key decisions while at the helm of the NCUA: to deregulate saving and loan rates, to allow a credit union to serve multiple ‘groups’ with a common bond (which allowed membership in credit unions to grow exponentially since), and to challenge credit unions to capitalize their own share insurance fund. As a result of these decisions, many feel he single-handedly saved the U.S. credit union movement.
Private sector career.
After leaving the NCUA, Callahan went on to found Callahan & Associates in Washington, DC, the nation's leading provider of independent financial data concerning credit unions in the United States. The group publishes "Callahan's Credit Union Report", which is a monthly publication that focuses on strategic concepts, thought-provoking ideas, and trends in the credit union industry. Callahan & Associates also seeks to promote the industry by facilitating cooperative endeavors among the nation's credit unions.
Callahan later became CEO of the San Francisco-based Patelco Credit Union. Due in large part to Callahan's leadership, Patelco grew from a regional credit union with $280 million in assets to a national one with more than $2.8 billion when he retired in 2002. Today, Patelco is currently the 14th largest credit union in America, with $4.2 billion in assets.
Awards and accolades.
Among the many accolades that Callahan was awarded, he was inducted into the Cooperative Hall of Fame in 2000 and was awarded the Wegner Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003 by the Credit Union National Association, which is the highest national honor given in the credit union industry.
At Callahan's retirement party on October 19, 2002, it was announced that more than $100 million had been pledged in his honor by the nation's credit unions to a newly created program, the Callahan Fund, at the National Credit Union Foundation. Proceeds from the investments of the fund support grant requests in the areas of cooperative development and financial literacy.
Death and legacy.
Callahan died on March 18, 2009, in Sacramento, California.
At his funeral on March 27, 2009, at the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament in Sacramento, it was announced that the Edgar F. and Kathleen M. Callahan Memorial Fund has been established at Marquette University in the honor of he and his late daughter, Kathleen.

Yao Ximing

Yao Ximing () (born 1956) is a former badminton player from China and current coach at the Vancouver Racquet Club in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.
Career.
A doubles specialist, Yao and partner Sun Zhian captured the men's doubles title at the 1979 World Championships in Hangzhou run by the short-lived World Badminton Federation, a China-led organization then in competition with the older International Badminton Federation. When the political complaints against the International Badminton Federation were resolved, Yao and Sun won men's doubles at the 1981 World Games in Santa Clara, California, the first major IBF sanctioned tournament in which China's players participated. In 1982 Yao and Sun helped China wrest the coveted Thomas Cup (men's world team trophy) from Indonesia, by defeating Indonesia's Kartono and Heryanto and thus gaining the critical fifth point in a best of nine match series. Yao and Sun participated in the 1983 IBF World Championships in Copenhagen but they were eliminated in the quarterfinals. Yao later migrated to the USA where he coached and played, winning the 1986 U.S. Open men's doubles with former Pakistani star Tariq Wadood. A few years later he moved to Canada where he became a coach at the Vancouver Racquet Club.

1931–32 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1931-32 campaign was a season that saw Town continue their impressive run of success under Clem Stephenson, by finish 4th in Division 1. The season is mostly noted for 2 reasons. The first is the impressive record of 42 goals scored by Dave Mangnall, a club record still to this day and for the record crowd set during Town's 6th round FA Cup clash with Arsenal during the season.
Review.
After finishing 5th the previous season, Town's reimbursed team carried their rich vein of form and managed an impressive run up the table, mainly thanks to the 33 league goals supplied by Dave Mangnall, which saw Town climb up to 4th place in the table. Combined with the 9 goals in the FA Cup, Mangnall's 42 goals give him the individual record of goals for a season in Town's history.
The season is also notable for Town's impressive FA Cup run. After wins over Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers and Preston North End, Town met Herbert Chapman's Arsenal in the 6th round at Leeds Road. The match was watched by over 67,000 people and saw Town lose to a goal in the 2nd minute.

<doc id="20280494" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20280494" title="Cyclopropenylidene">
Cyclopropenylidene

Cylopropenylidene, or c-C3H2, is an aromatic molecule belonging to a highly reactive class of organic molecules known as carbenes. Due to its reactivity, cyclopropenylidene is only seen terrestrially in the laboratory. However, it is found in significant concentrations in the interstellar medium (ISM) due to the extreme environment. The linear isomer of c-C3H2 is also found in the ISM, but its column density is generally about an order of magnitude lower.
History.
The astronomical detection of c-C3H2 was first confirmed in 1985. Four years earlier, several ambiguous lines had been observed in the radio region of spectra taken of the ISM, but the observed lines were not identified at the time. These lines were later matched with a spectrum of c-C3H2 using an acetylene-helium discharge.
Surprisingly, c-C3H2 has been found to be ubiquitous in the ISM. Detections of c-C3H2 in the diffuse medium were particularly surprising because of the low densities. It had been believed that the chemistry of the diffuse medium did not allow for the formation of larger molecules, but this discovery, as well as the discovery of other large molecules, continue to illuminate the complexity of the diffuse medium.
More recently, observations of c-C3H2 in dense clouds have also found concentrations that are significantly higher than expected. This has led to the hypothesis that the photodissociation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) enhances the formation of c-C3H2.
Formation.
The major formation reaction of c-C3H2 is the dissociative recombination of c-C3H3+.
c-C3H3+ is a product of a long chain of carbon chemistry that occurs in the ISM. Carbon insertion reactions are crucial in this chain for forming C3H3+. The protonation of NH3 by c-C3H3+ is the second most important formation reaction. However, under typical dense cloud conditions, this reaction contributes less than 1% of the formation of C3H2.
Destruction.
Cyclopropenylidene is generally destroyed by reactions between ions and neutral molecules. Of these, protonation reactions are the most common. Any species of the type HX+ can react to convert the c-C3H2 back to c-C3H3+. Due to rate constant and concentration considerations, the most important reactants for the destruction of c-C3H2 are HCO+, H3+, and H3O+.
Notice that c-C3H2 is mostly destroyed by converting it back to C3H3+. Since the major destruction pathways only regenerate the major parent molecule, C3H2 is essentially a dead end in terms of interstellar carbon chemistry. However, in diffuse clouds or in the photodissociation region (PDR) of dense clouds, the reaction with C+ becomes much more significant and C3H2 can begin to contribute to the formation of larger organic molecules.
Spectroscopy.
Detections of c-C3H2 in the ISM rely on observations of molecular transitions using rotational spectroscopy. Since c-C3H2 is an asymmetric top, the rotational energy levels are split and the spectrum becomes complicated. Also, it should be noticed that C3H2 has spin isomers much like the spin isomers of hydrogen. These ortho and para forms exist in a 3:1 ratio and should be thought of as distinct molecules. Although the ortho and para forms look identical chemically, the energy levels are different, meaning that the molecules have different spectroscopic transitions.
When observing c-C3H2 in the interstellar medium, there are only certain transitions that can be seen. In general, only a few lines are available for use in astronomical detection. Many lines are unobservable because they are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. The only lines that can be observed are those that fall in the radio window. The more commonly observed lines are the 110 to 101 transition at 18343 MHz and the 212 to 101 transition at 85338 MHz of ortho c-C3H2.

Constantine Richard Moorsom

Constantine Richard Moorsom (1792–1861) was a Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy. He commanded HMS "Fury" a "Hecla"-class bomb vessel which saw wartime service in the Bombardment of Algiers, an attack on Barbary pirates at Algiers in HMS "Fury" in August, 1816. Moorsom was the son of Admiral Sir Robert Moorsom, a veteran of Trafalgar. Moorsom was on the roster of HMS "Revenge", his father's ship, when it was at the Battle of Trafalgar. However records show that Constantine was actually at school at the time of the battle. Moorsom rose to be chairman of the London & North Western Railway.
Biography.
Early life.
Moorsom was born on 22 September 1792, the son of Admiral Sir Robert Moorsom who was to be a Knight Commander of the Bath and a veteran of the Trafalgar. His mother was born Eleanor Scarth.
Royal Navy.
Moorsom entered the Royal Navy College in Portsmouth where he was awarded a first medal and three prizes for mathematics. His service was noted by not only his progression but the record of his innovation. Moorsom's younger brothers also joined the navy. Henry Moorsom was killed in 1826 whilst in command of the sloop . His other brother William Scarth Moorsom left the navy in 1832 and became a successful railway engineer after training with Robert Stephenson. It is said that the brothers inherited their fathers talent for drawing and poetry. His sister, Maria Margaret, married in 1815 and had seven children with the Rev. Longueville Massell. His naval career started with his first posting to HMS "Revenge" which at the time was in the Atlantic off Portugal. The ship was involved in the defence of Cadiz. He became a lieutenant in 1816 after returning to England on board HMS "Warspite". He was then with until 1814 when he was rewarded with his own command of a sloop at Bermuda - HMS "Goree". He was with the boat a year then another year with HMS "Terror", before taking on the bomb vessel, .
He commanded HMS "Fury", a "Hecla"-class bomb vessel, in the Bombardment of Algiers, an attack on Barbary pirates at Algiers in August, 1816. As a result of the bombardment slaves were released and Moorsom's use of his vessel was put under investigation. It was found that the "Fury" had fired twice as many mortars as any other boat and that this was due to the fitting which Moorsom had devised. His methods were adopted as standard practice.
Moorsom became a post captain in 1818 and in 1822 his innovation came again to notice when he was put in command of HMS "Ariadne". "Ariadne" had been a problem vessel after she was converted into a corvette with the addition of a quarter deck to her original frigate frame. This increased her draught and made her difficult to manage, however Moorsom redistributed the storage and not only reported that she was now seaworthy, he sailed her around the Cape of Good Hope to prove the point. He was briefly an acting Commodore in Mauritius, but in 1825 he served for two years as the captain of his father's flagship at Chatham. He took no further sea missions but rose through the ranks to rear-admiral. In 1843 he published an essay on the "Principles of Naval Tactics" which he updated three years later.
Abolitionist.
In 1840, Moorsom attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. It was held at the Freemasons Hall on 12 June 1840 The meeting was attended by leading abolitionists from around the world. The portrait above is taken from the commemorative painting where he can be seen behind the head of Joseph Sturge of the Anti-Slavery International, who organised the conference. The painting hangs in the National Portrait Gallery.
Railways.
Constantine also went into the railway business as company secretary at the same company where his brother, William, was engineer. He was elected to the board of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway in 1841 and almost immediately became its chairman. He remained in this position until his resignation just before the company became part of the Midland Railway in 1843.
He served as a director of the London & Birmingham Railway from 1837 to 1839. He was promoted on 29 August 1851 to be a Rear-Admiral of the Blue. From 1852 until the time of his death on 26 May 1861, he was chairman of the London & North Western Railway. During this time he also chaired a committee for the British Association on steamship performance. He died at Russell Square in London after becoming a vice admiral in 1857 and having fathered a large family with his wife Mary Maude of Silaby Hall in Durham.

U.S. Route 522 in Maryland

U.S. Route 522 (US 522) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from Powhatan, Virginia to Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. In Maryland, it runs from the West Virginia state line at the Potomac River north to the Pennsylvania state line within Hancock in western Washington County. US 522 crosses Maryland at its narrowest north–south point, meeting Maryland Route 144 (MD 144), Interstate 70 (I-70), US 40, and I-68 before entering Pennsylvania concurrent with I-70. It is part of the National Highway System for its entire length in Maryland.
Warfordsburg Road from US 40 (now MD 144) north to Pennsylvania was paved around 1920 and designated US 522 in the late 1920s. US 522 was extended south into West Virginia shortly after a new bridge was completed over the Potomac River in the late 1930s. It was moved onto I-70 north of Hancock when the Interstate highway was completed in the area in the mid 1960s.
Route description.
US 522 enters Maryland by crossing the Potomac River on a long bridge at Hancock in western Washington County. The two-lane undivided bridge begins in West Virginia immediately after an intersection with River Road, then crosses CSX's Cumberland Subdivision and intersects a road to Potomac Airpark. The bridge crosses the state line on the south bank of the Potomac River, then continues above the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, Berm Road, the Western Maryland Rail Trail, and South Street before the bridge ends. Southbound US 522 receives a two-way ramp (unsigned US 522B) from MD 144 (Main Street) before bridging MD 144, Little Tonoloway Creek, and Limestone Road, which is unsigned MD 894. It becomes a divided highway immediately before northbound US 522 has a right-in/right-out interchange with High Street (unsigned US 522C), which leads to MD 144 via Virginia Avenue. Southbound US 522 has an exit ramp to Limestone Road used to access MD 144. US 522 meets I-70 and US 40 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) at a three-level directional interchange where US 522 becomes concurrent with the two other highways. Immediately to the north, I-70 and US 522 meet the eastern terminus of I-68 (National Freeway) at another three-level directional interchange (where westbound US 40 leaves I-70 and goes onto I-68). Southbound US 522 exits I-70 via a left exit (unsigned US 522A) prior to US 40 joining eastbound I-70, so southbound US 522 does not have a concurrency with US 40. I-70 and US 522 continue north as a four-lane freeway to the Pennsylvania state line.

Warfordsburg Road from Main Street at the west end of Hancock north to the Pennsylvania state line was paved in 1920. When the first number designations in the U.S. Highway System were released in 1926, US 622 was proposed for the highway between Hancock and Mount Union, Pennsylvania. Another proposed number for the highway may have been US 11W, which appears marked on Warfordsburg Road on official Maryland maps in 1927 and 1928. By 1930, the highway was marked as US 522. The March 1936 flooding of the Potomac River destroyed the pre-existing bridge over the river at Church Street. A temporary timber trestle was constructed while a new bridge was planned at the western edge of the town of Hancock. The new bridge and approach roads were completed in 1939. US 522 was extended south of Hancock by 1946. US 522 was moved from Warfordsburg Road to a concurrency with I-70 when the Interstate highway and the associated directional interchanges were completed in 1965.

The Nutty Professor (2008 film)

The Nutty Professor is a 2008 Canadian/American computer-animated comedy sequel to the 1963 Jerry Lewis comedy of the same name, produced by The Weinstein Company & Rainmaker Entertainment for Genius Products, LLC. Lewis reprises his role of Julius Kelp and produces the film. Drake Bell plays the voice of Harold Kelp, Julius' grandson. The film bears no relation to the Eddie Murphy series of comedies that Lewis also produced.
Synopsis.
To impress a beautiful girl, Harold Kelp, the grandson of professor Julius Kelp, who created a potion to transform his personality, gets his hands on his grandfather's secret elixir and unleashes his destructive alter ego, Jack.
Production.
On August 8, 2006, Mainframe Entertainment announced The Weinstein Company acquired the rights to produce an animated version of The Nutty Professor, which was distributed direct-to-video by Genius Products Inc.
The film was produced under the working title "The Nutty Professor 2: Facing the Fear". There is still some resemblance of the former title in the film. It was made 45 years after the original film and this sequel represents the longest gap in motion picture history for a sequel in which the original star reprises his same role. There are several references to the original film including the place where Zeke and Ned perform is called "The Pit". In the original film the nightclub is called "the Purple Pit". In addition, Jack (referring to pizza instead of his hand) paraphrases Buddy Love and says to Polly, "Want some?" Among the cast is Danielle Lewis, the daughter of Jerry Lewis, who cameos as the voice of Harold's neighbor, Suzy Perkins.

Other People's Children (TV series)

"Other People's Children" is a four-episode 2000 British television drama, adapted by Leigh Jackson from Joanna Trollope's 1998 novel of the same name. The series tells the story of how three women and two men deal with new marriages and the consequences of the new spouses or partners having to deal with their partner's children of different ages from previous marriages.
Plot.
When Josie (Emma Fielding) marries Matthew (Frank Harper), she already has a child, eight-year old Rufus (Jacob Engelberg), from her previous marriage to Tom (Denis Lawson). But Josie's patient determination crumbles as Matthew's three children turn against both her and Rufus. Things seem at first to be a lot easier for Josie's ex-husband, Tom, an architect who has two other children besides Rufus (Tom's first wife died when his children were small). Tom has a new partner, the calm, reasonable high-management career woman Elizabeth (Serena Gordon), whom Rufus (who visits Tom regularly) seems to like rather well. However, it's Tom's 25-year-old daughter, Dale (Emilia Fox), who can't bear to see her father in love, and moves back in with him in order to disrupt the romance and their possible future marriage. Indeed, Dale had earlier managed to drive away Josie. Meanwhile, Matthew's former wife, Nadine, very bitter after the divorce and living on very little income, has moved to the countryside, taking over a half-dilapidated old house. Her children leave the relative comfort of their home in order to escape their father's new wife, Josie, only to find themselves in deprived circumstances. The story moves back and forth between Josie, Nadine and Elizabeth. The stories eventually play themselves out: Elizabeth breaks the relationship with Tom, Matthew's children come to accept Josie, and Nadine finally makes peace with her countryside existence, even being befriended by a local farmer, with implications of a possible future romance.
Award nominations.
For her role as Nadine, Lesley Manville was nominated for Best Actress in the 2001 Royal Television Society Awards.

Fred Castle

Frederick Castle, born 8 April 1909 at Elham, Kent and died 17 May 1997 at Portscatho, Cornwall, was a schoolmaster in Bath, Somerset, who played first-class cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club in the school holidays for the four summers immediately after the Second World War.
A right-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional leg-break bowler, Castle played second eleven cricket for his native Kent in the Minor Counties in the early 1930s. According to a history of Somerset cricket, he was offered a contract as a professional by Kent "who liked the look of his assertive mid-order batting".
Moving to Somerset as headmaster of Oldfield Boys' School, a secondary modern school in Bath, he made his first-class cricket debut in 1946 in the Whitsun match against Gloucestershire, scoring 30 in his only innings. He reappeared in the three matches of the Bath cricket festival and then played regularly in the summer holidays. In 13 matches in the 1946 season, he scored 311 runs at an average of 18.29 runs per innings, with a highest score of 60 not out in an overwhelming two-day victory over Surrey at Weston-super-Mare. This remained his highest first-class score. He captained the side in the match against Lancashire at Old Trafford, but Somerset were bowled out twice in a day and lost the match by an innings.
In his three other seasons, he played much less often, and seven of his 10 first-class matches in 1947, 1948 and 1949 were at Bath. He scored one fifty in each of the three seasons, but never reached 60 again. In 1948, when Somerset failed to find an amateur captain who could spare the time to lead the side throughout the summer, he captained the county again in one match, declaring when he was 59 not out and then leading his side to an innings victory over Nottinghamshire.
Castle was an all-round sportsman, playing field hockey for both Kent and Somerset and football for Crystal Palace F.C. He had non-sporting interests too: as a baritone in amateur concerts and dramatics, and as a conjurer.

InBev

InBev is a brewing company that resulted from the merger between Belgium-based company Interbrew and Brazilian brewer AmBev that occurred in 2004. It existed independently until the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch in 2008, that formed Anheuser-Busch InBev (abbreviated AB InBev). InBev had operations in over 30 countries and sales in over 130 countries. In 2006, it had a market capitalization of €30.6 billion and net profit of €3.2 billion on sales of €13.3 billion.
On July 13, 2008, InBev agreed to buy Anheuser-Busch for a total value of $52 billion, which would create a new company to be named Anheuser-Busch InBev. It was reported that Anheuser will get two seats on the combined board. To obtain antitrust approval in the United States, InBev agreed to divest itself of the company that imports Labatt's beer, another InBev brand, into the United States; this transaction was completed on March 13, 2009.
The all-cash agreement, for $70 per share, or almost $52 billion, would create the world's largest brewer, uniting the maker of Budweiser and Michelob with the producer of Stella Artois, Bass and Brahma. The two companies would have yearly sales of more than $36.4 billion, surpassing the current number one brewer, London-based SABMiller.
History.
InBev was created in 2004 from the merger of the Belgian company Interbrew and the Brazilian company AmBev. Before the merger with Ambev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume; Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
Interbrew.
Interbrew's roots can be traced back to 1366 in Den Horen in Leuven when "Brouwerij Artois" was founded. Starting as early as the 1960s, the Artois brewery acquired several local breweries and hence consolidated its position in Belgium, until they expanded internationally by acquiring two Dutch breweries, Dommelsch in 1968 and Hengelo Bier in 1974. Finally in 1987, Artois and the Walloon-based brewer Piedboeuf, came together to form Interbrew. The move onto the global scene only happened when Interbrew acquired the Canadian beer brand Labatt. The transaction also included Labatt's sports-related assets, namely the Toronto Blue Jays baseball club, the Toronto Argonauts football club, and The Sports Network. At the time, Labatt was not much smaller than Interbrew, and since then the company has been considered a multinational with both Canadian and Belgian roots.
Some important Interbrew brands are Tennents, Stella Artois, Boddingtons, Beck's, Staropramen, Jupiler, Leffe, Labatt, Hoegaarden and Bass.
In December 2001 Interbrew, Danone (former owner of Kronenbourg, and two other smaller brewers) were fined €91m for operating a cartel in Belgium while four Luxembourg companies were fined €448,000 the same month.
AmBev.
AmBev is a Brazilian beer company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America.
Post-merger history.
InBev announced in 2005 and confirmed in 2006 that it would move the brewing of Hoegaarden, whose brewery they found to have become obsolete, to the Piedboeuf brewery in Jupille, which resulted in huge protests and great disappointment in the town of Hoegaarden. The beer, though, is made with a very special yeast that is difficult to cultivate and keep alive. The Jupille-based brewery proved not being capable of attaining desired levels of quality and InBev's sole alternative was to bring production back to the original Hoegaarden-brewery, causing great sarcasm in the media that, by that time, had become openly hostile towards the beer-giant. In September 2007 however, it was announced that brewing would continue at the Hoegaarden Brewery in Hoegaarden.
On June 12, 2008, InBev announced that it made a US$46 billion offer for the brewing firm Anheuser-Busch. This merger joined two of the world's four largest brewing companies (based on revenue) and created a company that brews three of the top beers in the world - Bud Light, Budweiser and Skol. InBev also stated that the merger would not result in any U.S. brewery closures and they would also attempt to keep on management and board members from both companies.
On Sunday, July 13, 2008, Anheuser-Busch announced that they had agreed to an acquisition by InBev valued at about US$52 billion in cash, or $70 per share. As a condition, InBev will be renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev and Anheuser-Busch would retain two seats on the board of directors.
Corporate governance.
Brazilian Carlos Brito is the current chief executive officer. Brito replaced John Brock at the end of 2005.
InBev's current Board of Directors include Allan Chapin, Carlos Alberto da Veiga Sicupira, Arnoud de Pret Roose de Calesberg, Jean-Luc Dehaene, Philippe de Spoelberch, Jorge Paulo Lemann, Roberto Moses Thompson Motta, Kees J. Storm, and Peter Harf (chairman of the Board).
Organization.
InBev is a global company which divides operations into five zones - North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, and Asia Pacific. In addition there is a Global Exports/Licenses section which comes under the responsibility of the central international department.
Operations.
Western Europe.
The Western Europe zone has 16 brewing plants producing 36.1 million hectolitres. The trading companies are InBev Belgium, InBev France, Brasseries de Luxembourg, Mousel-Diekirch SA, InBev Nederland, InBev UK, InBev Germany and InBev Italia.
InBev's operations in the UK began in 2000 when Interbrew acquired Tennent Caledonian Breweries and Whitbread PLC. The Western Europe Zone President is Alain Beyens.
InBev UK holds the number 3 market position in the UK with a 16.9% market share. 10.8 million hectolitres of beer are produced at three breweries - Magor in Wales, Samlesbury in England, and Stag in Mortlake, London. In August 2009 it was announced that Irish drinks company C&C had agreed to purchase Tennents for £180m, a deal which included the Wellpark brewery.
North America.
There are seven breweries in Canada.
Latin America.
Production was 131.1 million hectolitres in 2007.
Brands.
InBev has over 200 beer brands produced and sold throughout the world. The flagship brands are Stella Artois, Brahma, Beck's, Corona, and Leffe.
