Douglas Wellesley Morrell

Douglas Wellesley Morrell , (6 February 1917 - 6 February 1996) was an English electrical engineer and deputy managing director of Racal.
Education and Early Life.
Douglas was born in Plymouth on 6 February 1917, but was adopted and baptised nearly a year later, on 9 January 1918, as Douglas Wellesley Morrell at Emmanuel, Compton Gifford, Plymouth, Devon.
His father, Arthur Wellesley Morrell, was a paymaster for the Royal Navy at the Plymouth Dockyard.
Douglas was educated at Dauntsey's School in Wiltshire, and later at Faraday House in London, where he earned a bachelor of science (engineering) with honours, as well as a Gold Medal.
Both sons from his first marriage would later attend Dauntsey's, then an all-boys public school.
Career.
Douglas joined Marconi as an installation engineer in 1938, and would go on to travel around the British Empire throughout the war years installing radio direction-finding equipment as part of the war effort.
After the war, Douglas went on to work for Redifon as a sales engineer. It was with Redifon that he met Ray Brown, who would eventually join Calder Cunningham in starting Racal in 1950.
In April 1953, Douglas left Redifon to join Racal as their first sales manager, at the invitation of Ray Brown. Douglas became an investor and joined the board of directors in 1955. Douglas was instrumental in negotiating an exclusive licencing agreement between Racal and the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which had invented an improved high frequency receiver circuitry, in a Racal radio set that eventually "became the standard HF receiver for all the armed forces and monitoring agencies of the United Kingdom".
When he retired in 1982, Douglas was a Deputy Managing Director, though he remained closely involved in the company's activities during his early retirement in Germany.
During his lengthy career, Douglas became a member of the Society of British Aerospace Companies, and of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, having first joined as a Member in 1936, later becoming a Fellow in 1962.
Douglas was also a long serving Liveryman with the Worshipful Company of Scientific Instrument Makers, having been first clothed in the livery on 14 November 1961.
Honours.
Douglas was Gazetted as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 12 June 1982, following his retirement, and was invested later that year.

Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile

"Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile" is a 1979 album by Cliff Richard. It featured his biggest-ever single, "We Don't Talk Anymore", which was a UK No. 1 Hit, his first since 1968's "Congratulations" and his only one of the 1970s.
Background.
Recording sessions for the album began on 18 July 1978, before his previous album had been released. Over the next few days, the backing tracks of many of the songs were recorded, while the vocals weren't begun until January 1979 and continued on sporadically for the next few months, with the final vocal to be completed being for "Falling in Love" on 30 June 1979 (almost a year after the backing track). The final song to be considered for inclusion was "We Don't Talk Anymore", which had been recorded completely in one day in May 1979.
The album was produced largely by Terry Britten, a regular songwriter for Richard, but this was his first production work with him. Richard himself was named as co-producer, while "We Don't Talk Anymore" was credited to Bruce Welch, although this had also been heavily worked upon by Alan Tarney, the song's composer and Richard's future producer.
In July 1979, "We Don't Talk Anymore" was the first single to be released. Its fresh and contemporary pop sound made it an obvious choice and the public response was highly enthusiastic. The single quickly hit the number one spot, becoming Richard's first chart topper for more than a decade. It remained at the top for four weeks and became his biggest selling single in the UK, with sales just short of one million. It also became a big hit worldwide, including a top 10 entry in America. It eventually sold three million copies.
With the failure of his previous album, " Green Light, " behind him, EMI released the new album in September 1979 and it was an immediate top 10 hit. The album reached a peak position of No. 3 and remained on the charts for 21 weeks, making it his most successful studio album since the early 1960s. It also gained his highest placing in the US album charts at No. 74, where it was released under the title "We Don't Talk Anymore" with a slightly different track listing.
A second single was released in October, the less commercial "Hot Shot". Surprisingly, this only managed to chart at No. 46, but a third release, the harder-edged "Carrie" put Richard back into the top 10, reaching a high of No. 4 in March 1980. The latter single is one of his most highly regarded works, Allmusic calling it "one of the most electrifying of all Cliff Richard's recordings". It also became a hit in the US.
This album continued Richard's revival, which had begun in 1976 with the "I'm Nearly Famous" album and would now increase in strength for the next few years into the 1980s.
"Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile" was remastered and re-issued on compact disc in 2001.

Government of Goa

The Government of Goa has a unicameral legislature consisting of a forty member Legislative Assembly, headed by a Chief Minister who wields the executive power. The ruling government consists of the party or coalition garnering the most seats in the state elections and enjoying the support of a simple majority of the House. The governor is appointed by the President of India. The governor's role is largely ceremonial, but plays a crucial role when it comes to deciding who should form the next government or in suspending the legislature as has happened in the recent past. After having stable governance for nearly thirty years up to 1990, Goa is now notorious for its political instability having seen fourteen governments in the span of the fifteen years between 1990 and 2005. In March 2005 the assembly was dissolved by the governor and President's Rule was declared, which suspended the legislature. A by-election in June 2005 saw the Congress coming back to power after winning three of the five seats that went to polls. The Congress party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are the two largest parties in the state. In the assembly pole of 2007, Congress-led coalition won and started ruling the state. Other parties include the United Goans Democratic Party, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party. In the 2012 election the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) defeated the Indian National Congress government in Goa, led by Chief Minister Digambar Kamat. The election was won by the BJP-Maharashtrawadi Gomantak alliance which won 24 seats in the 40-seat assembly. The Bharatiya Janata Party won 21 seats, while the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party won 3 seats.
Manohar Parrikar, leader of the BJP, was sworn in as Chief Minister of Goa on 9 March 2012.

Stöckli

A Stöckli (Switzerland), "Korbhaus, Austragshaus, Ausgeding(e)haus, Nahrungshaus" or "Auszugshaus" (Germany) is a multifunctional agricultural building that is traditionally a part of farms in Switzerland and parts of Germany.
Etymology.
The Swiss German term "Stöckli" is a diminutive form of "Stock", a term used in the Middle Ages for any stone building in the countryside. The terms used in Germany make reference to the principal function of the building as a residence for aged farmers after turning over the farm to their heirs.
Construction.
Stöcklis were generally only built on larger farms. Often, they were created through the expansion of existing buildings such as oven sheds. If newly built, they were generally provided with large cellars to store the farm's produce in, replacing separate cellar houses or field cellars. The attic was often also used as storage space for grain, while the ground floor and upper floor (if any) were residential areas.
Stöcklis in historically poorer areas tend to be simple, wooden constructions. In more prosperous areas, such as in the Swiss plateau near Bern, they were often prestigious buildings, imitating the architecture and style of aristocratic country estates or country inns.

Implementation.
Following the publication of the Report a further document called "Design for Scouting" was published, outlining which of the Advance Party's recommendations had been accepted by the Committee of the Council. Only a few of the proposals were amended. Notably, it was decided against the deletion of "On my honour" from the Scout Promise; this obviated the need for the first of the proposed eight Scout Laws, leaving only seven. The suggestion that the Wood Badge insignia (for adult leader training) be replaced by a cloth emblem was also not adopted.
The first changes to be implemented were the adoption of the new Laws and Promises in October 1966 followed in May 1967 by the formal name change from "The Boy Scouts' Association" to "The Scout Association". In October of that year, the new uniform was introduced along with the new training schemes, including the launch of the Venture Scout section.
Outcomes.
Such radical change was not welcomed by all members and a reply, "A Boy Scout Black Paper", was produced in 1970 by "The Scout Action Group". This provided some alternative proposals for the development of the Movement and asked for Groups that wished to continue to follow Baden-Powell's original scheme to be allowed to do so. The content of this paper was not accepted by The Scout Association, resulting in a split developing in the Movement and the formation of the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association.
The front cover of the Black Paper featured a photograph of a Scout Group in South East London which, according to the forward of the document, was forced to close under APR due to the leader being aged 65 despite no replacement leader being available. The Paper concludes with a copy of the letter from North and Central Lambeth Scout Council refusing to re-register and, therefore, forcing the closure of the Group.
Following several years of reduction in overall numbers, the annual census of 31 March 1969 (18 months after the implementation of the Report) showed modest increases across two sections of the Association. The total of 531,011 included 249,561 Cub Scouts, 188,379 Scouts and 21,698 Venture Scouts in 11,704 Scout Groups. The total number of young people in the Association who were within the reduced Statutory Youth Service age range of 14 to 21 was over 81,000.
The Advance Party Report failed to recover the losses of older boys, with 55,206 Senior Scouts and Rover Scouts recorded in 1966 having been replaced by 21,698 Venture Scouts in the 1969 figures. The highest recorded membership of the Venture Scout section was 39,307 in 1989 (after the 1976 admission of girls into the Venture Scout section).
By March 1978, a decade after implementation, the overall Scout Association total had risen to 636,148, including 308,152 Cub Scouts, 207,276 Scouts and 27,905 Venture Scouts (of whom, 2,218 were girls). The number of Scout Groups had fallen to 11,464, reflecting the policy of amalgamating smaller units which had been proposed by the Advance Party. By 1998 the majority (68%) of members of The Scout Association were under 11 years old.
Further reviews.
The training schemes of the Scout Association were reviewed several times in the succeeding decades. A new training scheme and proress awards for the Scout section were launched in April 1985, Against the recommendations of APR, the Beaver Scout section for 6 and 7 year olds launched in April 1986 after a trial scheme and in February 1990, it was decided in principle that the Association would become fully co-educational. A new training scheme for Cub Scouts was launched in September 1990.
In May 2000 a new report called simply 'The Programme Review' was received by the Committee of the Council after extensive consultation with members of the Association and focus groups. A uniform review was conducted shortly afterwards. The new uniforms were launched during London Fashion Week in 2001 and implementation of the new training programmes began in 2002. This included splitting Ventures back into two sections, Explorer Scouts (14−18) and Scout Network (18−25); effectively restoring the pre-APR age boundaries by December 2003.

Eliseu Pereira dos Santos

Eliseu Pereira dos Santos (born 1 October 1983), simply known as Eliseu, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Málaga CF in Spain. A left winger who can also operate as a left back, he is mostly known for his speed.
Early years.
Eliseu was born in Angra do Heroísmo, Azores, to a Cape Verdean mother, Néné Pereira, a restaurant owner, and a Portuguese father, an ambulance driver. The couple divorced when their child was a teenager.
Club career.
Belenenses.
Eliseu moved to Portugal's mainland in 2002, moving from Sport Clube Marítimo de Angra do Heroísmo to C.F. Os Belenenses. He gradually broke into the Lisbon-based club's first team, appearing in 19 top division games in his second season.
After a loan with Varzim S.C. in the second level, Eliseu continued to be a relatively important offensive player for Belenenses, but being used mainly as a substitute.
Málaga.
For the 2007–08 campaign Eliseu, alongside countrymen Hélder Rosário and Paulo Jorge, moved to Málaga CF, helping the Andalusians return to La Liga after a two-year absence, with the Portuguese trio totalling 108 matches and six goals combined (three from Eliseu).
The following season he continued to be firmly established in the side's starting XI, scoring his first Spanish top flight goal(s) in a 4–0 away win over neighbours Recreativo de Huelva on 5 October 2008. The following month he also netted, in a 3–4 loss at Real Madrid.
On 25 June 2009, Eliseu joined S.S. Lazio in Italy for exactly €1 million. However, after receiving few opportunities, he joined Real Zaragoza on 7 January of the following year, on loan until the end of the season. He scored in only his second match for the Aragonese, which lost 2–4 at Villarreal CF.
After majorly contributing to Zaragoza avoiding relegation – he also scored in the last matchday, netting a thunderous 35-yard free kick against the same opponents, in a 3–3 home draw – Eliseu returned to Málaga, sharing teams with compatriot Duda.
Eliseu started the 2010–11 season firmly established in the starting XI. On 27 September 2010 he scored from 25 meters against Villarreal to open the score; minutes later, however, he headbutted Carlos Marchena and was sent off, in an eventual 2–3 home loss. As his suspension was lifted he was able to appear in the next fixture, at UD Almería, but the player again received his marching orders after elbowing Juan Manuel Ortiz (1–1 draw). When available, he was an undisputed starter, scoring in a 4–1 home win against Racing de Santander on 5 December 2010 from a volley and also providing two assists to Salomón Rondón; following the arrival of Manuel Pellegrini, who replaced sacked Jesualdo Ferreira, he was mostly used as a left back.
After the arrival of Nacho Monreal, Eliseu played in midfield more often then not. On 3 October 2012 he netted a brace in a 3–0 away win against R.S.C. Anderlecht for the season's UEFA Champions League group stage, the first coming from 20 meters with a thunderous volley and the second through a lob over the goalkeeper.
International career.
Courtesy of his Málaga performances, Eliseu was first called to the Portuguese national team for an exhibition game with Finland on 11 February 2009, but did not leave the bench. He finally made his debut on 10 June in a 0–0 friendly against Estonia.
Although not part of the provisional 24-player list for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Eliseu was named in a backup list of six players. He scored his first international goal on 7 October 2011, in a 5–3 home win against Iceland for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifiers where he featured as a left defender and also made two decisive passes.

Chhoya

Chhoya is a village placed at approximately 55 km southwest of Dipayal, Doti, Nepal. The altitude of the village is 1294 m (4246 feet) above the mean sea level and geographic locators - 29°15′58″N and 80°46′52″E. The village is located in Jijodamandau VDC of Doti District of Nepal. This is 2 ward of the village development committee. The population of this village is about of 400 individuals residing in 50 individual households. The chhoya is divided into two Mallo and Tallo Chhoya. 
The village are resided by four casts - Rosyara, Paneru, Bhul, and Damai. The village has beautiful panoramic view of typical mountains and Saipal Himalayan range can be viewed. Also there is also a small beautiful river (Ghatai garh)and newly establishing community forest. A five grade primary school for kids and a temple dedicated to Radha Krishana are located there. There is also an ancient forest sacred to the local goddess "Panere". The residents of Chhoya worship their local god every year.
History.
Rosyara, Paneru and Bhat have resided in Chhoya prior to the 14th century. Their origins are not known, but they may be from India. Historically Rosyara were royal priests of Doti district. Paneru are people who assist with carry and managing drinking water. The Bhatu Rosyara was one of ancestors who have very big house, horse and large number of "Jajman". Religious clients are known as “Jajman”. The Chhoya was gift of King of Doti (Regmi Research report). The inscribed in stone says that -
""Chaitra Badi 7, 1887 (44/221-22)
Royal order to Naran Rosyara: "Formerly, the village of Chhoyagaun in the Dankot garkha of Doti had been granted to your ancestors by the King of Doti through a copper plate inscription. The lands were subdivided in your family, and the prescribed pota tax was duly paid. Subsequently, Jyami Rosyara and Hiruwa Rosyara died without leaving any heirs behind, and a dispute arose among the other brothers about their share of the lands. It was eventually decided that you should cultivate the lands by rotation. In the year 1882 Vikrama, the lands were registered in the course of a revenue settlement in the name of Naran Rosyara. We hereby issue this order under the royal seal reconfirming the lands in your name. pay the prescribed taxes through the appropriate jimmawal and mukhiya and use the lands as your property (bepoti).""
Doti district was historically a separate country ruled by the Shah family. Rosyara are pandits of the Shah family. The Shah family of Doti district is different from the current King of Nepal. Doti was independent after 1376 extended from Kali Kumaon in west to Karnali in the east, Thakurji in the North and the terai in South. In 1797 V.S. Mandhata Shah reestablished Doti as independent state and Shah were ruling. Deep Shahi ruled Doti when the Nepalese troops attacked. His copper plate says that up to 1780 AD (Baishakh, 5,1847 VS) proved that he was not conquered till that date. Amar Singh Thapa succeeded to defeated the King of Doti in two battles at Dumrakot and Narimghat. Thus the Bhadur shah did victory over the Doteli king, still the King remained head of the administrative unit of the district as minor ruler (Rajaouta). This shows that Rosyara were already in the place at this time.
The present King of Doti is Raja Mahendra Chand of Kumaon, married to Rani Gita Chand of Rina and has three childrens. Rajkumari Aakanksha Chand, Rajkumari Mallika Chand and Rajkumar Aryan Chand.

<doc id="20428902" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20428902" title="Revati (raga)">
Revati (raga)

Revati is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is an "audava" rāgam (or "owdava" rāgam, meaning pentatonic scale). It is a "janya" rāgam (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven "swaras" (musical notes).
In Hindustani music a raga that closely resembles "Revati" is "Bairagi Bhairav". It is said to evoke "Karuṇa" rasa (pathos). This scale has also been used in chanting Vedas.
Structure and Lakshana.
"Revati" is a symmetric rāgam that does not contain "gāndhāram" or "dhaivatam". It is a pentatonic scale ("audava-audava" ragam in Carnatic music classification – "audava" meaning 'of 5'). Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
"Revati" is considered a "janya" rāgam of "Ratnangi", the 2nd "Melakarta" rāgam, though it can be derived from other melakarta rāgams, "Vanaspati", "Hanumatodi", "Natakapriya", "Vakulabharanam" or "Chakravakam", by dropping both "gāndhāram" and "dhaivatam".
Popular compositions.
"Revati" rāgam lends itself for elaboration and exploration and has many compositions. Here are some popular "kritis" composed in "Revati".
Lalgudi Jayaraman has also composed a melodious "Thillana" in this rāgam.
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Graha bhedam".
"Revati's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 2 other pentatonic rāgams, namely, "Shivaranjani" and "Sunadavinodini". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. See "Graha bhedam on Shivaranjani" for more details and an illustration.

Norwegian art

Norwegian art came into its own in the 19th century, especially with the early landscape painters. Until that time, the art scene in Norway had been dominated by imports from Germany and Holland and by the influence of Danish rule. Initially with landscape art, later with Impressionism and Realism.
The beginnings.
Johan Christian Dahl (1788–1857) is often said to be the "father of Norwegian landscape painting". After a period in Copenhagen, he joined the Dresden school to which he made an important contribution. He eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.
Another important early contributor was Johannes Flintoe (1787–1870), a Danish-Norwegian painter, known for his Norwegian landscapes and paintings of folk costumes. He taught at the School of Drawing ("Tegneskolen") in Christiania from 1819 to 1851 where his students included budding romanticists such as Hans Gude and Johan F. Eckersberg.
Adolph Tidemand (1814–1876) studied in Copenhagen, in Italy and finally in Düsseldorf where he settled. He often returned to Norway where he painted the old Norwegian farm culture. His best known painting is "The bridal procession in Hardanger" (together with Hans Gude, 1848) and "Haugianerne" ("Haugeans") painted in 1852.
Norway’s new-found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as Kitty Kielland, 1843–1914, an early female painter who studied under Gude and Harriet Backer, 1845–1932, another pioneer among female artists, influenced by impressionism.
Impressionists and neo-romanticists.
Frits Thaulow, 1847–1906, an impressionist, was initially a student of Hans Gude. He was later influenced by the art scene in Paris where he developed impressionist talents. Returning to Norway in 1880, he became one of the leading figures on the Norwegian art scene, together with Christian Krohg and Erik Werenskiold.
Christian Krohg, 1852–1925, a realist painter, was also influenced by the Paris scene. He is remembered for his paintings of prostitutes which caused something of a scandal.
Thorolf Holmboe (1866–1935) studied under Hans Gude in Berlin between 1886 and 1887 and Fernand Cormon in Paris between 1889 and 1891. He was inspired by many different styles at different points in his career, including Naturalism, Neo-romanticism, Realism and Impressionism.
Nikolai Astrup (1880–1928) grew up in Jølster in the west of Norway. After studying art in Oslo and spending some time in Paris and in Germany, he returned to Jølster where he specialised in painting neo-romantic landscapes with clear, strong colors. He is remembered as one of the greatest Norwegian artists from the early 20th century.
Lars Hertervig (1830–1902) from Tysvær in south-western Norway painted semi-fantastical works inspired by the coastal landscape in Ryfylke.
Harald Sohlberg, (1869–1935), a neo-romanticist, is remembered for his paintings of Røros, and the Norwegian "national painting" "Winter's Night in Rondane".
Edvard Munch.
Perhaps Norway's most famous artist is Edvard Munch, (1863–1944), a symbolist/expressionist painter who became worldfamous for The Scream which is said to represent the anxiety of modern man. Painted in 1893, The Scream is Munch's most famous work and one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man. With this painting, Munch met his stated goal of “the study of the soul, that is to say the study of my own self”.
Other names.
Other noteworthy 19th century painters are: August Cappelen, Peder Balke, Peter Nicolai Arbo, Eilif Peterssen, Gustav Wentzel, Oscar Wergeland, Erik Werenskiold, Asta Nørregaard, Amaldus Nielsen, Oda Krohg, Fritz Thaulow, Carl Sundt-Hansen, Christian Skredsvig, Gunnar Berg, Halfdan Egedius, Theodor Kittelsen, Harald Sohlberg.
Noteworthy painters from 20th century Norwegian art are: Harald Sohlberg, Reidar Aulie, Per Krohg, Arne Ekeland, Kai Fjell, Jacob Weidemann, Håkon Bleken, Jens Johannessen, Ludvig Karsten, Henrik Sørensen, Kjartan Slettemark, Anna-Eva Bergman, Anders Kjær, Svein Johansen, Svein Bolling, Bjørn Carlsen, Bjørn Ransve, Kåre Tveter, Frans Widerberg, Odd Nerdrum, Ida Lorentzen, Knut Rose, Ørnulf Opdahl, Håvard Vikhagen, Leonard Rickhard, Håkon Gullvåg, Kira Wager, Lars Elling, Vibeke Barbel Slyngstad.

He scored notable wins over Edwin Max and Dave Chisnall to earn a spot into the televised stages which were shown live on Setanta Sports. He then defeated Gary Robson in the quarter-finals and Mareno Michels in the semis before avenging his defeat over Anderson twelve months previously by beating him in the final to win the £3,000 top prize.

On 15 January 2011 Henderson came through qualifying at the PDC Q-School event and has therefore left the British Darts Organisation. On joining the PDC he said "It means everything to me the first two days were hard and I felt a lot of pressure today but to qualify, so I’m delighted I did it."

He qualified for the 2014 World Championship through the ProTour Order of Merit having claimed the ninth of sixteen places that were available to non-qualified players. Henderson started his first round match brightly as he took a 2–0 lead against seventh seed Dave Chisnall which included a 132 finish of bull, bull, double 16. He threw for the match in the third set but lost the leg and the set as Chisnall fought back to level the game. Henderson survived four match darts from Chisnall in the final set as he pulled off a big shock win in a performance he rated as the best of his career. Another tight match followed against Mark Webster with Henderson missing three darts at tops to seal a 4–2 win, and then went on to lose the deciding set to bow out of the tournament 4–3.
Personal life.
Outside darts he makes and tests slings for chemical offshore companies as he is only a part-time darts player. He has expressed his desire to go full-time on the circuit, which joining the PDC has potentially allowed him to do.

United States presidential election in the District of Columbia, 2008

The 2008 United States presidential election in the District of Columbia took place on November 4, 2008 throughout all 50 states and D.C., which was part of the 2008 United States presidential election. Voters chose 3 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
The District of Columbia went to Democrat Barack Obama by a margin of 210,403 votes out of 225,224 votes cast, about 92 percentage points of the total vote. Obama's margin was wider than John Kerry's in 2004, when Kerry won the District of Columbia by a margin of about 80 percentage points. D.C. has voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election by large margins since 1964.
Results.
Bob Barr was certified as a write-in in the District of Columbia, but votes for him weren't counted. Litigation is ongoing to have the votes counted. 
Results Breakdown.
Each candidate's best result is shown in bold.
Electors.
Technically the voters of D.C. cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. D.C. is allocated 3 electors. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 3 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 3 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.
The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. 
The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 3 were pledged to Barack Obama and Joe Biden:

Peter of Cornwall

Peter of Cornwall (1139/1140–1221) was a medieval scholar and prior of Holy Trinity, Aldgate. 
He was born near Launceston, Cornwall, the son of Jordan of Trecarrel (died c. 1180). He studied in London under Master Henry of Northhampton, a canon of St Paul's. He was received as an Augustinian canon sometime after 1170 at Holy Trinity, Aldgate. 
His first work was inspired by a synod in London where he heard the bishop of London, Gilbert Foliot, preach. This was the "Pantheologus", a collection of biblical material assembled as a sourcebook for preachers, which he finally completed in 1189.
He became prior of Holy Trinity in 1197 and remained in office until his death on 7 July 1221. In 1210 Peter was one of two intermediaries between King John of England and Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, during a series of negotiations which failed to achieve an end to the interdict. Peter dedicated his "Liber disputationum contra Symonem Iudeum" to the exiled Stephen Langton.
Peter also compiled the "Liber revelationum" (Lambeth Palace Library, MS 51). This is a vast collection of visions relating to the next world, compiled between the years 1200 and 1206. The work includes several personal stories which provide much evidence for Peter's life and career. 
He is buried at Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate.

Koinup

Koinup is an image and video hosting service, web portal and online community for virtual world users. It is used both as a photo and video repository platform and as a tool to share virtual world screenshots, photographs and machinima. , it claims to host more than 100,000 items uploaded by its members and reaches about 100,000 visitors monthly.
Centered around the concept of “Share your Virtual Life", Koinup offers a social networking platform for all virtual world inhabitants.
History.
Koinup was developed by Koinup Srl, a Brescia, Italy-based company founded in March 2007. The service was launched in September 2007, preceded by a four-month beta period. Initially, the two founders Pierluigi Casolari and Edoardo Turelli served respectively as chief executive officer and chief technical officer. Along with competitors such as gamerDNA, Koinup followed a trend in the social network scenery at that time by building a social network for online games.
Features.
Koinup is a free service, allowing members to upload up to 1.5 gigabytes of photo and video content. Currently, Koinup does not offer a paid premium plan. Uploaders can add tags to their entries and create photo or video galleries. Uploaded content can be shared either by embedding web widgets on websites, or by using a set of social media sharing tools.
Koinup also features tools aimed at creating a bridge between virtual worlds and the website. These tools allow users to interact with their Koinup account while they are in virtual worlds. Particularly, members can send postcards directly from the clients to their Koinup galleries without leaving the virtual worlds.
One of the most popular features on the website is the Koinup Places Section. Koinup Places allow users to geotag virtual world locations and upload them on Koinup. This feature creates a user-generated directory of the best places hosted in virtual worlds. According to a recent publication, more than 1,000 virtual places have already been suggested by the Koinup community.
On April 22, 2010, Koinup expanded their service by launching a paid application on the Nokia Store featuring wallpapers of virtual world related image content. With the launch of "Metaverse Wallpapers" on March 11, 2011 on Apple's App Store, a similar application became available for iOS devices.
Interoperability.
One of the main challenges faced by Koinup is the issue of interoperability between virtual worlds.
Right now, the virtual world scene is made up of numerous standalone walled gardens that do not communicate with each other. There are neither standardized tools for moving and sharing the avatar identity from one world to another nor ways to interact with multiple virtual worlds from a single dashboard. In response to this problem, one of Koinup's goals is to allow users to manage both the content and the friends they have in various virtual worlds with a single account.

European Council of Religious Leaders

European Council of Religious Leaders (ECRL) is a European interreligious council for cooperation between senior leaders of religious traditions represented in Europe (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Zoroastrianism). The ECRL is one out of five regional interreligious councils within the global movement, Religions for Peace. The Council held its inaugural meeting in Oslo in 2002.
Vision and Work.
Vision: The major religious communities in Europe cooperate effectively for peace and reconciliation, in Europe and beyond.
This vision grows out of the shared commitment of faith traditions to human dignity and the right to live in peace. On this basis religious leaders have committed themselves to work together in order to prevent conflict, promote peaceful coexistence
and encourage their communities to do the same. European Council of Religious Leaders works on the basis of mutual respect and appreciation for religious diversity.
Based in the different religious traditions and Holy Books, the Council encourages a common moral responsibility for the prevention of conflict and the promotion of dialogue. Values that are deeply held and widely shared offer guidance to the work. In a continent where religion has often been seen as a source of conflict, the European Council of Religious Leaders seeks to be a resource for peace.
The ECRL aims at promoting inter-religious cooperation in Europe and beyond. The work of the Council includes annual council meetings, participation in conferences, delegation visits to conflict areas and maintaining contacts across religious boundaries.
The secretariat of the ECRL is situated in Oslo and the Moderator is Bishop Emeritus Gunnar Stålsett.
The European Council of Religious Leaders' Berlin Declaration on Interreligious Dialogue.
As a guideline for the work of the Council and to spread knowledge of inter-religious dialogue, the ECRL, on its Council meeting in Berlin in 2008, issued a declaration:
Members.
The council consists of senior religious leaders representing: 7 per each religion/denomination of longer history of presence in Europe, 6 of religious traditions with shorter presence in Europe and 4 "ex officio" members representing different entities of Religions for Peace movement.
Moderator.
2002-2012: Gunnar Stålsett

Ptitim

Ptitim () is an Israeli toasted pasta shaped like rice or little balls. Outside of Israel, it is known as Israeli couscous or Jerusalem couscous. In Israel it is sometimes colloquially and jokingly called "Ben-Gurion rice" (Hebrew: אורז בן-גוריון "órez Ben-Gurion").
History.
"Ptitim" was invented during the austerity period in Israel (from 1949 to 1959). Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, asked Eugen Proper, one of the founders of the Osem food company, to quickly devise a wheat-based substitute to rice. Consequently, it was nicknamed "Ben-Gurion's rice" by the people. The company took up the challenge and developed ptitim, which is made of hard wheat flour and roasted in an oven. The product was instantly a success, after which ptitim made in the shape of small, dense balls (which the company termed "couscous") was added to the original rice-shaped ptitim.
Preparation.
Ptitim is popular among Israeli children, who eat it plain, or mixed with fried onion and tomato paste. Ptitim are now produced in ring, star, and heart shapes for added appeal. For health conscious consumers, there are also whole-wheat and spelt flour ptitim.
While considered a children's food in Israel, ptitim is sometimes treated as an ingredient for "trendy delicacies". In the United States, it can be found on the menus of contemporary American chefs, and can be bought in gourmet markets.
Ptitim can be used in many different types of dishes, both hot and cold. They retain their shape and texture even when reheated, and they do not clump together.
Commonly, ptitim are prepared with sautéed onions or garlic (vegetables, meat, chicken or sausages can also be added); the ptitim are then added, and fried for a short time before adding water. Ptitim can also be used as a substitute for pasta or rice. They can also go in soup, can be baked, served in a pie, or made as a risotto. American chef Charlie Trotter has produced a recipe for ptitim with spinach, artichoke, and Kalamata olives.
Similar products.
Pearl-shaped ptitim are somewhat similar to the Levantine pearled couscous known as "maftoul" or "mograbieh" in Lebanon. It is also similar to the Kabyle "Abazine" and the Sardinian "Fregula". Rice-shaped ptitim are similar to "orzo".

<doc id="20429444" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20429444" title="Orleans Collection">
Orleans Collection

The Orleans Collection was a very important collection of over 500 paintings formed by the French prince of the blood Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans, mostly acquired between about 1700 and his death in 1723. Apart from the great royal-become-national collections of Europe it is arguably the greatest private collection of Western art, especially Italian, ever assembled, and probably the most famous, helped by the fact that most of the collection has been accessible to the public since it was formed, whether in Paris, or subsequently in London, Edinburgh and elsewhere. 
The core of the collection was formed by 123 paintings from the collection of Queen Christina of Sweden, which itself had a core assembled from the war booty of the sacks by Swedish troops of Munich in 1632 and Prague in 1648 during the Thirty Years War. After the French Revolution the collection was sold by Louis Philippe d'Orléans, "Philippe Égalité", and most of it acquired by an aristocratic English consortium led by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. Much of the collection has been dispersed, but significant groups remain intact, having passed by inheritance. One such group is the Sutherland Loan or Bridgewater Loan, including sixteen works from the Orleans Collection, in the National Gallery of Scotland, and another is at Castle Howard, Yorkshire. There are twenty-five paintings formerly in the collection now in the National Gallery, London, which have arrived there by a number of different routes.
The collection is of central interest for the history of collecting, and of public access to art. It figured in two of the periods when art collections were most subject to disruption and dispersal: the mid-17th century and the period after the French Revolution.
Rudolf and Christina.
The paintings looted from Prague Castle had mostly been amassed by the obsessive collector Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1552–1612), whose own bulk purchases had included the famous collection of Emperor Charles V's leading minister Cardinal Granvelle (1517–86), which he had forced Granvelle's nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the "greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of Titian and Leoni and many other artists", including his protégé Antonis Mor. The Swedes only skimmed the cream of the Habsburg collection, as the works now in Vienna, Madrid and Prague show. 
Most of the booty remained in Sweden after Christina's departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art. She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to Antwerp in a ship before she abdicated. 
Christina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small Raphael predella panels from the Colonna Altarpiece, including the "Agony in the Garden" now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome. She was apparently given Titian's Death of Actaeon by the greatest collector of the age, Archduke Leopold William of Austria, Viceroy in Brussels - she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion, and gave some generous gifts herself, notably Albrecht Dürer's panels of "Adam" and "Eve" to Philip IV of Spain (now Prado). 
On her death she left her collection to Cardinal Decio Azzolino, who himself died within a year, leaving the collection to his nephew, who sold it to Don Livio Odescalchi, commander of the Papal army, at which point it contained 275 paintings, 140 of them Italian. The year after Odescalchi's death in 1713, his heirs began protracted negotiations with the great French connoisseur and collector Pierre Crozat, acting as intermediary for Philippe, duc d'Orléans. The sale was finally concluded and the paintings delivered in 1721. The French experts complained that Christina had cut down several paintings to fit her ceilings, and had over-restored some of the best works, especially the Correggios, implicating Carlo Maratti.
Collection in Paris.
The Orleans collection was housed in the magnificent setting of the Palais-Royal, the Paris seat of the Dukes of Orléans. Only 15 paintings in the printed catalogue of 1727 had been inherited by Philippe II from his father, Philippe de France, Duke of Orléans, "Monsieur" (1640–1701); the "collection" as catalogued was by no means all the art owned by the Dukes, but recorded only that part kept together in the Palais-Royal for public viewing. He also inherited small but high quality collections from Henrietta Anne Stuart, his father's first wife, in 1701 and his father's lover, the Chevalier de Lorraine in 1702. 
According to Reitlinger, his most active phase of collecting began in about 1715, the year he became Regent on the death of his uncle Louis XIV, after which he no doubt acquired an extra edge in negotiations. He also began to be presented with many paintings, most notably the three Titian "poesies" now in Boston and shared by Edinburgh and London, which were given by Philip V of Spain to the French ambassador, the Duc de Gramont, who in turn presented them to the Regent. 
Christina's collection only joined Philippe's shortly before the end of his life and most of the other works were bought in France, like the Sebastiano del Piombo "Raising of Lazarus", with some from the Netherlands or Italy, like the Nicolas Poussin set of the "Seven Sacraments", bought from a Dutch collection by Cardinal Dubois in 1716. Other sources included the heirs of Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin, and Cardinal Dubois, with an especially important group from Colbert's heir the Marquis de Seignelay, and others from the Dukes of Noailles, Gramont, Vendôme and other French collectors. 
The paintings were housed in two suites of large rooms running side-by-side down the west or library wing of the palace, with the smaller Dutch and Flemish works in smaller rooms. The gallery suites of rooms still retained much of their original furniture, porcelain and wall-decorations from their use by Phillippe's father as grand reception rooms and according to a visitor in 1765 it was "impossible to imagine anything more richly furnished or decorated with more art and taste". Rearrangements had been made to accommodate the paintings; connoisseurs particularly praised the "Galerie à la Lanterne", with its even, sunless top light diffused from the cupola overhead. For most of the 18th century it was easy to visit the collection, and very many people did so, helped by the printed catalogue of 1727, republished in 1737, "Description des Tableaux du Palais Royal". This contained 495 paintings, though some continued to be added, and a few disposed of. 
Paintings were hung, not by 'schools' or by subject but in order to maximise their effects in juxtaposition, in the 'mixed school' manner espoused by Pierre Crozat for his grand private collection in his Parisian "hôtel"; the mixture on a wall of erotic and religious subjects was disapproved of by some visitors. The collection was most notable for Italian paintings of the High and Late Renaissance, especially Venetian works. The collection included no fewer than five of the "poesies" painted for Philip II of Spain, of which two are now shared between Edinburgh and London, two always in London (Wallace Collection and National Gallery), and one in Boston. A series of four mythological allegories by Veronese are now divided between the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, and the Frick Collection (with two, one illustrated above) and Metropolitan Museum in New York. Another Veronese series, the four "Allegories of Love" now in the National Gallery, hung as overdoors in the central salon, which also held the larger Veronese series, three of the Titian "poesies" and Correggios.
The collection included (on the contemporary attributions) 28 Titians, most now regarded as workshop pieces but including several of his finest works, 12 Raphaels, 16 Guido Renis, 16 Veroneses, 12 Tintorettos, 25 paintings by Annibale Carracci and 7 by Lodovico Caracci, 3 major Correggios plus ten no longer accepted as by him, and 3 Caravaggios. Attributions no longer accepted, and probably regarded as dubious even then were 2 Michelangelos, and 3 Leonardos. There were few works from the 15th century, except for a Giovanni Bellini. The collection reflected the general contemporary confusion outside Spain as to what the works of the great Velázquez actually looked like; the works attributed to him were of high quality but by other artists such as Orazio Gentileschi.
French works, of which the catalogued collection included relatively few, included a set of the "Seven Sacraments" and 5 other works by Poussin. There were paintings by Philippe de Champaigne now in the Wallace Collection and Metropolitan Museum, and a Eustache Le Sueur which turned up in 1997 over a door in the Naval & Military Club and is now in the National Gallery. The Flemish works were dominated by Rubens with 19 paintings, including a group of 12 studies now widely dispersed, van Dyck with 10 works and David Teniers with 9. The Dutch paintings included 6 Rembrandts, 7 works by Caspar Netscher (one now Wallace Collection) and 3 by Frans van Mieris (one now National Gallery) that were more highly regarded then than they are now. There were 3 Gerrit Dous and 4 Wouwermans. 
Philippe's son Louis d'Orléans, religious and somewhat neurotic, attacked with a knife one of the most famous works, Correggio's "Leda and the Swan", now in Berlin, and ordered the painter Charles-Antoine Coypel to cut up all three of the great Correggio mythological works in the presence of his chaplain, which Coypel did, but saving and repairing the pieces. The "Leda" went to Frederick the Great of Prussia, the "Danäe" to Venice, where it was stolen and eventually sold to the English consul at Leghorn, and "Jupiter and Io" went to the Imperial collection in Vienna. Some of the Flemish paintings were sold at auction in Paris, June 1727.
Beginning in 1785, a series of 352 engravings of the paintings were published on a subscription basis, until the series was abandoned during the Terror, by which time the paintings themselves had been sold. It was finally published in book form in 1806. These prints have greatly reduced the uncertainty that accompanies the identity of works in most dispersed former collections. There had already been many prints of the collection; the "Seven Sacraments" were especially popular among the middle classes of Paris in the 1720s.
Gonzagas and Charles I.
Another famous collection whose history was entwined with the Orleans Collection was that assembled by the Gonzagas of Mantua, especially Francesco II (1466–1519) and his son Federico II (1500–1540). Their court artists included Mantegna and Giulio Romano, and they commissioned work directly from Titian, Raphael, Correggio and other artists, some of which were given as gifts to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, to whom Mantua was effectively a client state. The most important of these gifts were the mythological works by Correggio, later to be mutilated in Paris. By the early 17th century the dynasty was in terminal decline, and the bulk of their portable art collection was bought by the keen collector Charles I of England in 1625-27. Charles's other notable purchases included the Raphael Cartoons and volumes of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, and his own most notable commissions were from Rubens and van Dyck. By the time his collection of paintings was seized and sold after his execution in 1649 by the English Commonwealth it was one of the finest outside Italy. Meanwhile, three years after the sale to Charles, Mantua was sacked by Imperial troops, who added much of what was left there to the Imperial collection in Prague, where they rejoined the diplomatic gifts of a century earlier. 
Some Mantuan paintings therefore passed from Prague via Christina to the Orleans Collection, while more were bought by French collectors in the London "Sale of the Late King's Goods" in 1650, and later found their way to the Palais-Royal. For example, an "Infancy of Jupiter" by Giulio Romano, bought from Mantua, left Charles' collection for France, passed to the Orleans Collection and the London sales, and after a spell back in France returned to England and was later bought by the National Gallery in 1859.
Other paintings in the same series were recovered for the Royal Collection in 1660; Charles II was able to exert pressure on most English buyers of his father's collection, but those gone abroad were beyond his reach. One important Rubens of Charles', the "Landscape with St George and the Dragon" (of 1630 - St George has Charles's features, the rescued princess those of his Queen), which passed via the Ducs de Richelieu to the Palais-Royal and London, had always been recognised for what it was, and was bought back for the Royal Collection by George IV in 1814.
Another picture commissioned by Charles, the "Finding of Moses" by Gentileschi, painted for the Queen's House, Greenwich, was returned to Charles' widow Henrietta Maria in France in 1660. By the time it entered the Orleans Collection a half-century later, it was regarded as by Velázquez. It then was one of the Castle Howard paintings, and was only correctly identified after the existence of Gentileschi's second version in the Prado became known in England. After a sale in 1995 it is now on loan to the National Gallery from the current owner. Phillippe's father's first wife, Henrietta Anne Stuart, was Charles I's daughter, and her small but select collection had been mostly given to her by her brother Charles II from the reclaimed royal collection on her marriage in 1661. On her death forty years later this was left to Phillippe.
Dispersal in London.
In 1787 Louis Philippe d'Orléans, the Regent's great-grandson, whose huge income could not keep pace with his gambling habit, had sold his equally famous collection of engraved gems to Catherine the Great of Russia, and in 1788 he was in serious negotiations with a syndicate organized by James Christie, founder of Christies, the London auctioneer, for the sale of the paintings. Christie got as far as arranging that the collection should be made over to him upon the deposit of 100,000 guineas in the Bank of England, before the negotiations collapsed when the Prince of Wales having subscribed his name in the book for 7,000 guineas, and his brothers the dukes of York and Clarence for 5,000 each, no further subscribers were to be found. It was Dawson Turner's opinion that the failure was owing to the general sense that at the division of the spoils the lion's share would go to the Royals.
In 1792 Philippe Égalité impulsively sold the collection "en bloc" to a banker of Brussels who immediately sold it at a huge profit to the enlightened connoisseur Jean-Joseph de Laborde de Méréville, who set about adding a gallery to house it attached to his "hôtel" in rue d'Artois. Ruined by events, he was forced to sell it once more.
The 147 German, Dutch and Flemish paintings were sold by Orléans to Thomas Moore Slade, a British dealer, in a syndicate with two London bankers and the 7th Lord Kinnaird, for 350,000 "livres" in 1792, and taken to London for sale. There were protests from the French artists and public, and from the Duke's creditors, and Slade found it prudent to tell the French the pictures were going overland to Calais, but actually to sneak them onto a barge by night, and ship them down the Seine to Le Havre. These paintings were exhibited for sale in London's West End in April 1793 at 125 Pall Mall, where admissions at 1 shilling each reached two thousand a day, and sold to various buyers.
"Philippe Égalité", as he had renamed himself, was arrested in April 1793 and was guillotined 6 November, but in the meantime sale negotiations for the Italian and French paintings were renewed, and they were sold for 750,000 "livres" to Édouard Walkiers, a banker of Brussels, who soon after sold them on, unpacked, to his cousin, Count François-Louis-Joseph de Laborde-Méréville, who had hoped to use them to add to the French national collection. After the start of the Terror, and the execution of his father as well as the Duke of Orléans, Laborde-Méréville saw he had to escape France, and brought the collection to London in early 1793.
The French and Italian paintings then spent five years in London with Laborde-Méréville, the subject of some complicated financial manoeuvres, including the failure of an attempt supported by King George III and the Prime Minister Pitt the Younger to buy them for the nation. They were finally bought in 1798 by a syndicate of the canal and coal-magnate Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, his nephew and heir, Earl Gower, later 1st Duke of Sutherland, and the Earl of Carlisle. Gower, who was perhaps the prime mover and must have known the collection well from his time as British ambassador in Paris, contributed 1/8 of the £43,500 price, Carlisle a quarter, and Bridgewater the remaining 5/8s.
The pictures were put on exhibition for seven months in 1798, with a view to selling at a least a part of them, in Bryan's Gallery in Pall Mall, with the larger ones at the Lyceum in the Strand; admission was 2/6d rather than the 1s. usual for such events. On first seeing the collection there, William Hazlitt wrote "I was staggered when I saw the works ... A new sense came upon me, a new heaven and a new Earth stood before me." In 1798, 1800 and 1802 there were auctions of those paintings not sold via the galleries, generally achieving rather low prices, but 94 out of 305 of the paintings were retained by the syndicate, as seems always to have been intended, and these largely remain in their families today. However these paintings represented over half of the valuations placed on the whole portion bought by the syndicate. Even at the often low prices realized, the sales to others, and entry receipts to the exhibitions, realized a total of £42,500, so even allowing for the expenses of the exhibitions and auctions, the syndicate got their works very cheaply. Castle Howard, home of the Earls of Carlisle, originally had fifteen works, now much reduced by sales, donations, and a fire, but the Bridgewater/Sutherland group remain intact to a large degree.
The London market in these years was flooded by both other collections from France itself, and those dislodged by the French invasions of the Low Countries and Italy—by 1802 including Rome itself. As is often the case with old collectors, their choices of what to keep and what to sell seem in many cases very strange today: the two "Michelangelos" were only sold in the auctions, and for only 90 and 52 guineas. Many Titians were sold, but many Bolognese Baroque works, as well as most of the later (but not the earlier) Raphaels, were retained. The single Watteau went for only 11 gn, while one Carracci was valued at £4,000 for the galley sale, where all 33 Carraccis were sold, while works attributed to Giovanni Bellini and Caravaggio remained at the auction stage. The current location of many of the pictures can no longer be traced, and many are now attributed to lesser artists or copyists. Overall the prices realized for the better pictures were high, and in some cases their level would not be reached again for a century or longer. As an extreme case, a Ludovico Carracci valued at 60gn in 1798 was auctioned by the Duke of Sutherland in 1913 raising 2gn.
An example of a work now only known from a replica (in the Galleria Borghese in Rome) and studies is "Aeneas and his Family Fleeing Troy", the only secular history painting by Federico Barocci. The prime version was given in 1586 by Francesco Maria II, the last Duke of Urbino, to Rudolph II in Prague, and was later looted by the Swedes. It was taken to Rome by Queen Christina, passed to the Orleans collection, and finally sold at auction in London for 14 guineas in 1800 (the price probably reflecting the poor condition some sources mention), since when its whereabouts are unknown. The Rome version was painted in 1598, presumably for Cardinal Scipio Borghese.
The paintings of both portions of the collection were bought by a wide range of wealthy collectors, the great majority English, as the wars with France made travelling to London difficult for others. Major buyers included Thomas Hope, a Dutch banker (distantly of Scottish extraction) sheltering in London from the Napoleonic Wars, who with his brother (of Hope Diamond fame) bought the two large Veronese allegories now in the Frick, and works by "Michelangelo", "Velásquez" and Titian, John Julius Angerstein, a Russian-German banker whose collection later became the foundation of the National Gallery, the Earl of Darnley, the Earl of Harewood, who bought Titian's "The Death of Actaeon", and Earl FitzWilliam, whose collection was to found the Fitzwilliam Museum.
An analysis by Gerard Reitlinger of "most" of the buyers (of the Italian and French pictures) divides them as follows:
- a breakdown he describes as "quite unlike anything in Europe and grotesquely unlike pre-revolutionary France", where the main collectors were the tax farmers. Many of the same figures appear in the similar list of buyers of the Northern paintings.
Much of our information about the sales comes from the "Memoirs of Painting, with a Chronological History of the Importation of Pictures of Great Masters into England by the Great Artists since the French Revolution", by William Buchanan, published in 1824, of which the first 200 pages of Volume I are devoted to the Orleans sales, listing the works and most prices and buyers. Buchanan was himself involved in the import of art from 1802 onwards, and had his information from the dealers involved. He presents his own "exertions", and those of others, in the area in a thoroughly patriotic light, by implication as a part of the great national struggle with the French. Nicholas Penny notes the "somewhat comic" disparity between Buchanan's "sonorous words" on the subject and the "coarse and mercenary business letters" he reprints—many by himself.
Bridgewater collection.
On Bridgewater's death five years after the purchase, he bequeathed his collection to Gower, who put it and his own paintings on at least semi-public display in Bridgewater House, Westminster; it has been on public display ever since. The collection contained over 300 paintings, including about 50 Orleans paintings, and was known as the "Stafford Galley" in Cleveland House until the house was rebuilt and renamed as Bridgewater House in 1854, and then as the "Bridgewater Gallery". It was opened in 1803, and could be visited on Wednesday afternoons over four, later three, months in the summer by "acquaintances" of a member of the family (in practice tickets could mostly be obtained by writing and asking for them), or artists recommended by a member of the Royal Academy. Angerstein's paintings were on display on similar terms in his house in Pall Mall, which from 1824 became the first home of the National Gallery.
On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the collection was moved from London to Scotland. Since 1946 26 paintings, sixteen from the Orleans Collection, known collectively as "the Bridgewater loan" or "the Sutherland Loan" have been on loan to the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh, though up to 2008 five from this group had been bought by the Gallery. 
The collection has passed by descent to the 7th Duke of Sutherland, (most of whose wealth is contained in the paintings collection), but in late August 2008 the 7th Duke announced that he wished to sell some of the collection in order to diversify his assets. He has at first offered "Diana and Callisto" and "Diana and Acteon", two works by Titian as a pair to the British national galleries at £100 m (a third of their overall estimated market price) over a period. The National Gallery of Scotland and the National Gallery in London announced they would combine forces to raise the sum, initially in the form of £50 m to purchase "Diana and Actaeon" paid over three years in instalments and then £50 m for "Diana and Callisto" paid for similarly from 2013. The campaign gained press support, though it received some criticism for the Duke's motives or (from John Tusa and Nigel Carrington of the University of the Arts) for distracting from funding art students In 2009 it was announced that the first £50M for "Diana and Actaeon" had been raised - the painting will rotate every five years between Edinburgh (first) and London. The sale of "Diana and Callisto" for £45M was announced in 2012.
Current locations.
Other works are in: Berlin, Vienna, Dresden, Malibu, Paris, Rome, Boston (Titian "Rape of Europa"), Tokyo, Kansas City, and many other cities.

Nicolas Sarrabat

Fr. Nicolas Sarrabat or Sarabat (February 7, 1698 – April 27, 1739), also known as Nicolas Sarrabat de la Baisse, was an eighteenth-century French mathematician and scientist. He was born in Lyon, the son of the painter Daniel Sarrabat (1666–1748), and the nephew of engraver Isaac Sarrabat. The Sarrabats had been a prosperous Protestant bourgeois family of clock- and watchmakers, though Nicolas's father had converted to Catholicism.
Sarrabat showed a love of learning from an early age. He was said to have started his studies without his parents' knowledge; they only became aware of them when Nicolas submitted and defended a thesis at the Lyon Collège de la Trinité in the presence of his father, who had been tricked into attending. He went on to enter the Jesuit order, and was employed as the Royal Professor of Mathematics at Marseille. 
Scientific papers.
Sarrabat's scientific interests seem to have been very varied, and the "Academie Royale des Belles-lettres, Sciences et Arts de Bordeaux" awarded him several prizes for his work: one was for an essay on magnetism, the "Nouvelle hypothèse sur les variations de l'aiguille aimantee", which argued that a spherical fire at the Earth's core was the driving force behind the expulsion of magnetic matter.
In 1730, he published the "Dissertation sur les causes et les variations des vents", which sought to explain wind patterns by the action of the Sun on the atmosphere. His most famous experiments involved immersing the roots of living plants in the red juice of "Phytolacca" berries in order to observe circulation. As the Academy, mainly to stop Sarrabat's presence discouraging other authors, had ruled that an author could not win the same prize three times, he submitted this work, "Sur la circulation de la sève des plantes", under the pseudonym "Monsieur de la Baisse", but eventually confessed his true identity. The plant genus "Baissea" is named after him - or rather after his pseudonym - in honour of this work.
In 1735-36 Sarrabat travelled with the Chevalier de Caylus - a ship's captain and the brother of the Comte de Caylus - through the Mediterranean on an archeological excursion to the island of Milos and to Malta, describing his experiences in a series of excited and spirited letters to the Marquis de Caumont. Though Caylus came from a famously Jansenist family, the Jesuit Sarrabat struck up a great friendship with him, describing him as "un très aimable homme". Caylus and Sarrabat walked into the interior of Milos, discovering and partly unearthing a series of ancient ruins very close to where the "Venus de Milo" was discovered many years later.
Astronomy.
Sarrabat also had an interest in astronomy, and is remembered in the field for having discovered an unusual comet, the Comet of 1729 (Comet Sarabat): it is thought to have been the largest, with the greatest absolute magnitude, on record. Sarrabat discovered the comet without the aid of a telescope, though he was initially unsure if it was in fact a detached part of the Milky Way. In astronomical literature his name is often spelt "Sarabat", following the spelling used by Jacques Cassini, who made further observations of the same comet.
A colleague remembered him as "tall, with a countenance that showed the passion of the loftiness of his thought, and with a very gentle manner".
Sarrabat died in 1739 while visiting Paris on official business, or according to some sources, while seeking treatment for a liver ailment.

The Pattern of Painful Adventures was a 1576, prose novel. A later edition, printed in 1607 by Valentine Simmes and published by Nathaniel Butter, was drawn on by William Shakespeare for his play "Pericles, Prince of Tyre". There was at least one intermediate edition, around 1595.
It was a translation by Lawrence Twine of the tale of Apollonius of Tyre from John Gower's "Confessio Amantis" (in Middle English verse). It is also said to be translated from a French version. William Henry Schofield stated that Shakespeare used both sources.

<doc id="20429570" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20429570" title="Motor imagery">
Motor imagery

Motor imagery is a mental process by which an individual rehearses or simulates a given action. It is widely used in sport training as mental practice of action, neurological rehabilitation, and has also been employed as a research paradigm in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology to investigate the content and the structure of covert processes (i.e., unconscious) that precede the execution of action.
Definition.
Motor imagery can be defined as a dynamic state during which an individual mentally simulates a given action. This type of phenomenal experience implies that the subject feels herself/himself performing the action. It corresponds to the so-called internal imagery (or first person perspective) of sport psychologists.
Mental practice of action.
Mental practice refers to use of visuo-motor imagery with the purpose of improving motor behavior. Visuo-motor imagery requires the use of one’s imagination to simulate an action. It has come to the fore due to the relevance of imagery in enhancing sports performance.
Sports.
Mental practice is frequently used by athletes and coaches to increase performance.
Motor deficits.
Mental practice has been used to rehabilitate motor deficits in a variety of neurological disorders. Mental practice of action seems to improve balance in individuals with multiple sclerosis, and balance in elderly women (Fansler, Poff, & Shepard, 1985). For instance, mental practice has been used with success in combination with actual practice to rehabilitate motor deficits in a patient with sub-acute stroke. Several studies have also shown improvement in strength, function, and use of both upper and lower extremities in chronic stroke.
Functional equivalence of motor preparation and motor imagery.
Motor imagery has been studied using the classical methods of introspection and mental chronometry. These methods have revealed that motor images retain many of the properties, in terms of temporal regularities, programming rules and biomechanical constraints, which are observed in the corresponding real action when it comes to execution. For instance, in an experiment participants were instructed to walk mentally through gates of a given apparent width positioned at different apparent distances. The gates were presented to the participants with a 3-D visual display (a virtual reality helmet) which involved no calibration with external cues and no possibility for the subject to refer to a known environment. Participants were asked to indicate the time they started walking and the time they passed through the gate. Mental walking time was found to increase with increasing gate distance and decreasing gate width. Thus, it took the participant longer to walk mentally through a narrow gate than to walk through a larger gate placed at the same distance. This finding led neurophysiologists Marc Jeannerod and Jean Decety to propose that there is a similarity in mental states between action simulation and execution.
The functional equivalence between action and imagination goes beyond motor movements. For instance similar cortical networks mediate music performance and music imagery in pianists.
Neurophysiological mechanisms.
Measurements of cardiac and respiratory activity during motor imagery and during actual motor performance revealed a covariation of heart rate and pulmonary ventilation with the degree of imagined effort.
Motor imagery activates motor pathways. Muscular activity often increases with respect to rest, during motor imagery. When this is the case, EMG activity is limited to those muscles that participate in the simulated action and tends to be proportional to the amount of imagined effort.
The effects of motor imagery.
Motor imagery is now widely used as a technique to enhance motor learning and to improve neurological rehabilitation in patients after stroke. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in musicians.
Simulation and understanding mental states.
Motor imagery is close to the notion of simulation used in cognitive and social neuroscience to account for different processes. An individual who is engaging in simulation may replay her own past experience in order to extract from it pleasurable, motivational or strictly informational properties. Such a view was clearly described by the Swedish physiologist Hesslow. For this author, the simulation hypothesis states that thinking consists of simulated interaction with the environment, and rests on the following three core assumptions: (1) Simulation of actions: we can activate motor structures of the brain in a way that resembles activity during a normal action but does not cause any overt movement; (2) Simulation of perception: imagining perceiving something is essentially the same as actually perceiving it, only the perceptual activity is generated by the brain itself rather than by external stimuli; (3) Anticipation: there exist associative mechanisms that enable both behavioral and perceptual activity to elicit other perceptual activity in the sensory areas of the brain. Most importantly, a simulated action can elicit perceptual activity that resembles the activity that would have occurred if the action had actually been performed.
Mental simulation may also be a representational tool to understand the self and others. Philosophy of mind and developmental psychology also draw on simulation to explain our capacity to mentalize, i.e., to understand mental states (intentions, desires, feelings, and beliefs) of others (aka theory of mind). In this context, the basic idea of simulation is that the attributor attempts to mimic the mental activity of the target by using her own psychological resources. In order to understand the mental state of another when observing the other acting, the individual imagines herself/himself performing the same action, a covert simulation that does not lead to an overt behavior. One critical aspect of the simulation theory of mind is the idea that in trying to impute mental states to others, an attributor has to set aside her own current mental states, and substitutes those of the target.

Kāśyapīya

Kāśyapīya (Sanskrit: काश्यपीय; Pali: "Kassapiyā" or "Kassapikā"; ) was one of the early Buddhist schools in India.
Etymology.
The name "Kāśyapīya" is believed to be derived from Kāśyapa, one of the original missionaries sent by King Ashoka to the Himavant country. The Kāśyapīyas were also called the "Haimavatas".
History.
The Kāśyapīyas are believed to have become an independent school ca. 190 BCE. According to the Theravadin "Mahāvaṃsa", the Kāśyapīya were an offshoot of the Sarvāstivāda. However, according to the Mahāsāṃghika account, the Kāśyapīya sect descended from the Vibhajyavādins.
Xuanzang and Yijing note small fragments of the Kāśyapīya sect still in existence around the 7th century, suggesting that much of the sect may have adopted the Mahāyāna teachings by this time.
In the 7th century CE, Yijing grouped the Mahīśāsaka, Dharmaguptaka, and Kāśyapīya together as sub-sects of the Sarvāstivāda, and stated that these three groups were not prevalent in the "five parts of India," but were located in the some parts of Oḍḍiyāna, Khotan, and Kucha.
Appearance.
Between 148 and 170 CE, the Parthian monk An Shigao came to China and translated a work which describes the color of monastic robes (Skt. "kāṣāya") utitized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called "Da Biqiu Sanqian Weiyi" (Ch. 大比丘三千威儀). Another text translated at a later date, the "Śāriputraparipṛcchā", contains a very similar passage corroborating this information. In both sources, members of the Kāśyapīya sect are described as wearing magnolia robes. The relevant portion of the Mahāsāṃghika "Śāriputraparipṛcchā" reads, "The Kāśyapīya school are diligent and energetic in guarding sentient beings. They wear magnolia robes."
Doctrines.
In Vasumitra's history "Samayabhedoparacanacakra", the Haimavatas (Kāśyapīya sect) are described as an eclectic school upholding doctrines of both the Sthaviras and the Mahāsāṃghikas.
According to the "Kathāvatthu" commentary, the Kāśyapīyas believed that past events exist in the present in some form.
According to A.K. Warder, the Kāśyapīya school held the doctrine that arhats were fallible and imperfect, similar to the view of the Sarvāstivādins and the various Mahāsāṃghika sects. They held that arhats have not fully eliminated desires, that their "perfection" is incomplete, and that it is possible for them to relapse.
Texts.
Some tentatively attribute the Gāndhārī "Dharmapada" to the Kāśyapīya school.
An incomplete translation of the Saṃyukta Āgama (T. 100) that is in the Chinese Buddhist canon is believed to be that of the Kāśyapīya sect. This text is different from the complete version of the Saṃyukta Āgama (T. 99), which came from the Sarvāstivāda sect.

Knowledge broker

A Knowledge broker is an intermediary (an organization or a person), that aims to develop relationships and networks with, among, and between producers and users of knowledge by providing linkages, knowledge sources, and in some cases knowledge itself, (e.g. technical know-how, market insights, research evidence) to organizations in its network.
While the exact role and function of knowledge brokers are conceptualized and operationalized differently in various sectors and settings, a key feature appears to be the facilitation of knowledge exchange or sharing between and among various stakeholders, including researchers, practitioners, and policy makers.
A knowledge broker may operate in multiple markets and technology domains.
The concept of knowledge brokers is closely related to the concept of knowledge spillovers.
In the fields of public health, applied health services research, and social sciences, knowledge brokers are often referred to as bridges or intermediaries
that link producers of research evidence to users of research evidence as a means of facilitating collaboration to identify issues, solve problems
and promote evidence-informed decision making (EIDM), which is the process of critically appraising and incorporating the best available research evidence, along with evidence from multiple other sources into policy and practice decisions
Using a knowledge broker to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and the adoption of insights is one strategy in the broader field of Knowledge Management.
Function.
Knowledge brokers facilitate the transfer and exchange of knowledge from where it is abundant to where it is needed, thereby supporting co-development and improving the innovative capability of organizations in their network. In the field of public health, knowledge brokers facilitate the appropriate use of the best available research evidence in decision making processes, enhancing individual and organizational capacity to participate effectively in evidence-informed decision making. In this setting, knowledge brokers promote research use.
Knowledge brokers are typically involved in the following activities below:
Expertise.
Knowledge brokers provide a link between the producers and users of knowledge. To facilitate this knowledge exchange, knowledge brokers are required to build rapport with their target audiences and forge new connections across domains.
A successful knowledge broker will possess:
Examples of knowledge brokers.
Every individual or organization, which has access to knowledge from several, unconnected entities, can theoretically act as a knowledge broker. Certain types of organizations have been identified to be acting primarily as knowledge brokers:
Climate change knowledge broker initiative.
A project funded by the Climate & Development Knowledge Network is aiming to integrate sources of climate change information and tailor data into relevant information products. Access to reliable information and data, and the ability to share lessons and experience, are considered key ingredients in tackling climate change, particularly within developing countries. However, although numerous websites, portals and online platforms have been set up to provide such information, the ‘knowledge infrastructure’ within the climate and development sector is still weak. The project aims to fill some of the gaps and provide bridges between isolated initiatives.
A study by IISD investigated the value of knowledge brokers within the climate change sphere. Interviews and surveys were conducted with more than 200 online climate change information users to understand their needs, preferences and behaviours. The findings were published in the paper "A user-oriented analysis of online knowledge brokering platforms for climate change and development". This publication identifies potential areas for innovation in online knowledge brokering and highlights the need for taking climate knowledge brokering beyond its online functions.

Sunadavinodini

Sunadavinodini is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is an "audava" rāgam (or "owdava" rāgam, meaning pentatonic scale). It is a "janya" rāgam (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven "swaras" (musical notes).
Structure and Lakshana.
"Sunadavinodini" is a symmetric rāgam that does not contain "rishabham" or "panchamam". It is a pentatonic scale ("audava-audava" ragam in Carnatic music classification – "audava" meaning 'of 5'). Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
"Sunadavinodini" is considered a "janya" rāgam of "Kalyani", the 65th "Melakarta" rāgam, though it can be derived from 2 other melakarta rāgams, "Gamanashrama" or "Kosalam", by dropping both "rishabham" and "panchamam".
Popular compositions.
"Sunadavinodini" rāgam lends itself for elaboration and exploration and has many compositions. Here are some popular "kritis" composed in "Sunadavinodini".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Graha bhedam".
"Sunadavinodini's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 2 other pentatonic rāgams, namely, "Shivaranjani" and "Revati". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. See "Graha bhedam on Shivaranjani" for more details and an illustration.

The Pattern of Painful Adventures (radio play)

The Pattern of Painful Adventures is a 90-minute 2008 radio play by Stephen Wakelam on the circumstances surrounding the writing of the play "Pericles, Prince of Tyre" by William Shakespeare and the sickness of his brother Edmund's child, introduced by a flashback by his daughter Susannah, playwright John Marston and William's secretary Robinson. It links the play to the marriage of Susannah and the birth of her daughter and to the similar themes of daughters, forests, storms, shipwrecks and lost infants from "As You Like It", "The Winter's Tale", and "The Tempest". It is named after "The Pattern of Painful Adventures", a main source for "Pericles". It was first broadcast on BBC Radio 3 at 8pm on 23 November 2008, directed and produced by Jeremy Mortimer, and was followed in the same slot on 30 November by a repeat of a 2005 radio production of "Pericles", with Tom Mannion as Pericles and Benjamin Zephaniah as Gower.

Karol Sikora

Dr Karol Sikora (born 1948) is a controversial and outspoken British physician specialising in oncology. He is currently Medical Director of CancerPartnersUK, Director of Medical Oncology at the Bahamas Cancer Centre, a partner in and dean of the University of Buckingham's medical school.
Early life.
Karol Sikora was born in 1948. His father was a Captain in the Polish Army who arrived in Great Britain during World War II. He was brought up in Edinburgh, Stafford and London. He had a London County Council scholarship to Dulwich College before going to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge where he became a Foundation Scholar and obtained a double first. He received his PhD at Stanford University where he also served a clinical fellowship.
Career.
After leaving Stanford, Dr. Sikora returned to Cambridge to direct the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. From 1985-1997, he served as the clinical director for cancer services at Hammersmith Hospital in London, where he established a cancer research laboratory and still serves as an honorary consultant oncologist. In 1997, he accepted a position as the Chief of the Cancer Program of the World Health Organization, which he held for two years. He served as the Vice President of Global Clinical Research in Oncology at the Pharmacia Corporation from 1999 to 2002. He has also been a member of the UK Health Department’s Expert Advisory Group on Cancer, as well as the Committee on the Safety of Medicines.
He is currently Medical Director of CancerPartnersUK and dean of the University of Buckingham's medical school; the only private medical school in the UK. He is an unpaid member of the Meat Advisory Panel, an industry-backed group of researchers, scientists and health care professionals that provide information and advice about meat as part of a balanced diet. He is a member of the Oncology Scientific Advisory Board at biopharmaceutical company Cyclacel Limited, and serves as an oncology consultant for AstraZeneca. Dr. Sikora will also serve as the Interim Director of Radiation Oncology for the newly constructed Cancer Centre Eastern Caribbean in Antigua, filling in after the original director, Dr. Arthur Porter, was diagnosed with cancer.
Sikora has co-authored or edited twenty books, including "Treatment of Cancer" and "the Economics of Cancer Care". Sikora is known for his outspoken views, and has written for "the Times", "the Observer", the "Daily Mail", the "New Statesman", and other publications.
Criticism of National Health Service.
Sikora is very critical of cancer care available on the National Health Service. During President Obama's campaign for healthcare reform, he appeared in a Republican Party attack ad in the United States criticizing the NHS. Sikora told "The Guardian" that he did not know he would be used in the ad campaign, and that he agreed with Obama about the American health care system.
Promotion of Alternative Medicine.
Sikora and the School of medicine at Buckingham have in the past been supportive of alternative medicine. Buckingham for a short time offered a diploma in "integrated medicine" (a relatively recent euphemism for alternative medicine). Sikora was a Foundation Fellow of Prince Charles' now-defunct alternative medicine lobby group "The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health" and Chair of the "Faculty of Integrated Medicine", which is unaffiliated with any university and also includes Drs Rosy Daniel and Mark Atkinson, who led Buckingham's "integrated medicine" course. Sikora is also a "professional member" of the ""The College of Medicine"", a patient-oriented healthcare lobby group also linked to the Prince of Wales that appeared shortly after the collapse of the Prince's "Foundation". The "College" has been criticised extensively in the British Medical Journal for its promotion of alternative medicine. These claims have been contested by the College. He is on the advisory panel of complementary cancer care charity "Penny Brohn Cancer Care," formerly the Bristol Cancer Help Centre of whom the Prince of Wales is patron, and is a patron of the Ian Rennie Hospice at Home. Statements by Sikora have been critical of unproven methods of alternative medicine, after Parliament member Lord Maurice Saatchi proposed a bill allowing doctors to use unproven experimental therapies, and when he spoke out against claims that an alkaline diet can cure cancer.
Controversies.
Release of Lockerbie bomber.
In September 2009, the convicted Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds. It was common knowledge that Sikora was one of three different doctors hired by the Libyan government to report to them about Megrahi's condition. Sikora's report concluded that Megrahi had only 3 months to live due to terminal prostate cancer. Sikora's medical diagnosis was not used by the Scottish Justice Minister and his diagnosis agreed with the medical evidence that "was" used. Once released, Megrahi returned to Libya and though he outlived the 3-month prognosis Megrahi subsequently died from his illness.

Thomas Alexander Harris

Thomas Alexander Harris (1826 - April 9, 1895) was a United States Army officer at the end of the Mexican–American War and a Missouri State Guard (Confederate) brigadier general during the early months of the American Civil War (Civil War). He then became a prominent Confederate politician, serving in the First Confederate Congress from 1861 to 1864. Among other occupations, he was a Missouri State Representative before the Civil War and a Kentucky State Representative in 1885–1886.
Thomas A. Harris was born in Warren County, Virginia in 1826. His family moved to Missouri when Harris was a young boy. An orphan, he fought in the 1838 Mormon War at the age of 12. Harris attended the United States Military Academy in 1843–1845 but did not graduate. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 12th U.S. Infantry Regiment in 1848 but peace was declared to end the Mexican-American War on the day he reported for duty. He participated in two filibustering expeditions in the early 1850s. He then returned to Hannibal, Missouri where he became attorney for a railroad, city attorney and a newspaper editor. He was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1860 and became chairman of the military committee.
As a brigadier general in the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard, he fought at the First Battle of Lexington, Missouri. Between late 1861 and 1864, he represented Missouri in the First Confederate Congress. He then smuggled equipment for the Confederate States Army from Europe through the Union blockade of the Confederacy.
After the Civil War, Harris worked for the Life Insurance Association of America in St. Louis, Missouri and opened an office in Texas in 1870. Then he worked for a New Orleans, Louisiana newspaper. After this, he moved to Kentucky, where his friendship with the governor gained him an appointment as assistant secretary of state. Harris won a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives from Oldham County in 1885–1886.
Thomas Alexander Harris died on April 9, 1895 in Pee Wee Valley, Kentucky near Louisville, Kentucky. He is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

David Railton

Reverend David Railton MC MA, (13 November 188413 June 1955) was a Church of England clergyman, a Military chaplain and the originator of the idea of the tomb of The Unknown Warrior.
Early life.
Railton was the son of George Scott Railton, the first Commissioner of The Salvation Army and Second in Command after its Founder General William Booth, and his wife, Marianne Deborah Lydia Ellen Parkyn. Although he saw little of him, David Railton shared his father's faith and concern for the poorest in society. He was educated at Keble College, Oxford, matriculating in 1904 and obtaining his BA degree in 1908; and was further educated at Bishop's Hostel, in Liverpool. Having joined the Church of England he was ordained in Liverpool in 1908 and took up the curacy of Edge Hill in Liverpool.
World War I.
In 1910 he moved to Ashford, Kent, and in the following year became temporary chaplain to the Forces. He was curate of Folkestone in 1914–20, but had leave of absence to serve in France. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1916 for saving an officer and two men under heavy fire.
Railton first had the idea of arranging for the body of an unknown serviceman to be transported back to England, and buried with full honours, in 1916, while he was serving on the Western Front during World War I. Later in the War he wrote to Lord Douglas Haig expressing this idea. He received no response, but felt reluctant to let it go.
The Unknown Warrior.
After the War Railton became the vicar of St. John the Baptist Church at Margate, but he still hoped to impress the authorities with his idea. In August, 1920 he wrote to Bishop Ryle, the Dean of Westminster, about the possibility of giving an unidentified soldier a national burial service in Westminster Abbey. Ryle took up the idea and his and Lloyd George's enthusiasm won over the initially hesitant King George V. In October 1920 Railton heard that his idea had been accepted by the Government. A committee headed by Lord Curzon, the then Foreign Secretary, was arranging for an unknown “warrior” to be disinterred in France and brought to Westminster Abbey. On 7 November 1920 six, or according to other accounts four, working parties visited the battlefields of Ypres, the Marne, Cambrai, Arras, the Somme, and the Aisne, where units of the Royal Naval division as well as the Army had died: each party exhumed an unidentified body which was examined to ensure that it was British before being placed in a plain coffin. 
At midnight one of these coffins was chosen by Brigadier General L.J. Wyatt, General Officer Commanding troops in France and Flanders, and thus became the official 'Unknown Warrior', placed in a new coffin bearing the inscription ‘A British Warrior who fell in the Great War 1914–1918 for King and Country’.
In 1916 Railton was an experienced and mature man in his thirties and was appalled at the sufferings and loss caused by the War. He later tried to explain why he had felt it was so important to commemorate the individual in this way. He recalled an incident near Armentieres where he came across a grave with a rough wooden cross inscribed "An unknown British soldier, of the Black Watch":
"How that grave caused me to think!... But, who was he, and who were they folk?... Was he just a laddie... . There was no answer to those questions, nor has there ever been yet. So I thought and thought and wrestled in thought. What can I do to ease the pain of father, mother, brother, sister, sweetheart, wife and friend? Quietly and gradually there came out of the mist of thought this answer clear and strong, “Let this body - this symbol of him - be carried reverently over the sea to his native land”. And I was happy for about five or ten minutes."
Later years.
After the war Railton returned briefly to Folkestone before being successively vicar of St John the Baptist, Margate (1920–25), curate of Christ Church, Westminster, vicar of St James's, Bolton, Yorkshire, vicar of Shalford, near Guildford (1931–5), rector of St Nicholas's, Liverpool, and archbishop's visitor to the RAF (1943–5) before his retirement in 1945. In addition he worked with the Revd Geoffrey Anketell Studdert Kennedy (better-known as the First World War padre poet 'Woodbine Willie') for the Church of England's Industrial Christian Fellowship, among workers at their places of work.
'Padre' Railton made his home in retirement at Ard Rhu, Onich, Inverness-shire, and was returning there on 13 June 1955 from Battle, Sussex, where he had been helping the Rural Dean, when he accidentally fell from a moving train at Fort William railway station and died from his injuries. He was survived by his widow, one son, and four daughters; Dame Ruth Railton, the founder of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, was one of his daughters.

Edmund Shakespeare (1580, Stratford-upon-Avon – buried 31 December 1607, London) was a 16th- and 17th-century English actor.
Life.
He was the son of John Shakespeare and Mary Arden and thus the youngest brother of the playwright William Shakespeare. He followed William to London to become an actor. While an actor, he had an affair with an unknown woman, though there is no evidence it was around 1600, and fathered a son, Edward Shakespeare, in one record noted wrongly as Edmund Sharksbye. He died in 1607, at the age of 27, four months after that baby boy, and in the same year Susanna Shakespeare was married, William's daughter, and 20 shillings was paid for his burial (possibly by William) at St Saviour's in Southwark "with a forenoone knell of the great bell".

Quotes.
Commenting on the text of the Greek New Testament, he said:
The text is changing. Every time that I make an edition of the Greek New Testament, or anybody does, we change the wording. We are maybe trying to get back to the oldest possible form but, paradoxically, we are creating a new one. Every translation is different, every reading is different, and although there’s been a tradition in parts of Protestant Christianity to say there is a definitive single form of the text, the fact is you can never find it. There is never ever a final form of the text.
Regarding a textual change in Codex Sinaiticus:
There is also a fascinating place in the codex in the Sermon on the Mount where we can see a change to the text altering the attitude to anger. Jesus says the person who is angry with his brother deserves judgement. But there is a variation on that. If you look at the page in Codex Sinaiticus you will see that somebody’s added a little word in the margin in Greek which changes it to “the person who is angry with his brother without good reason deserves judgement,” and there you’ve got two very different views of Christian life.

Royalty, presidents and the Remington collection.
Remington carriages have transported kings, queens, princes with their princesses, dukes and duchesses, earls, countesses, marquesses, lords and ladies, presidents and world heads of state. Celebrities worldwide have found themselves behind the reins of a Remington carriage. Remington Carriages were a part of the world-famous Calgary Stampede and the 1988 Winter Olympic Games. Calgary Heritage Park Days and Spruce Meadows International Equestrian Horse Shows often feature the Remington collection. Remington carriages have attended hundreds of parades worldwide.

Role of carriages and funerals.
insert image Hearse1900 manufactured by A.B. Greer of London Ontario.
Funerals were an important rituals in the Victoria era. With all the pomp and pageantry a family could afford, the deceased was laid to rest. The etiquette of morning was tied very closely to a formal social code of dress and behavior.
By the mid-19th century the hearse had evolved from a wagon draped with mourning cloth complete with carved pillars, urns, lamps and interior draperies. The glass panels in the sides of the hearses made the casket visible, thereby accentuating the ceremonial aspects of funerals. For many people, a hearse was the only elegant vehicle they ever got to ride in.
Hollywood and The Remington Collection.
The popular Fox television show "The Simpsons" episode 17 of the 17th season, "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore", features sisters Patty and Selma kidnapping Richard Dean Anderson, the actor who played action hero MacGyver. Selma and Patty show Dean slides of their summer vacation, including various carriages from the Remington Museum with a front image of Patty and Selma standing next to a bronze statue of the museum's visionary, Don Remington.
Hollywood has made the covered wagon and stagecoach icons of the idealized Old West, and the Remington Carriage Museum has both, including coaches used in past and present Hollywood productions. Visitors can climb aboard the stagecoach used by Jackie Chan in Disney's "Shanghai Noon" and by Tom Selleck in "Crossfire Trail".
The Fay Wray Fountain Memorial is located one block from the Remington Carriage Museum. Fay Wray rose to fame as the dame in distress in the immortal 1933 film "King Kong". When Fay Wray returned to Cardston in 1967, she rode in a Remington Concord Stagecoach. Cowboy Country Television profiled Don Remington, season 4 episode 12.
Horses and The Remington Collection.
The story of 19th century transportation would be incomplete without the horse, and the museum's herd of Clydesdales, Quarter Horses and Canadians are a major feature of daily programs. An elegant equestrian eventing program is also featured at the museum, demonstrating the skill and protocol of competitive driving horses in harness. Each horse breed is selected to support the ride program at the museum.
The Clydesdale breed is a widely recognized draft horse used in teams of two, three or four to pull large vehicles seating up to 18 passengers. This breed is known famously as the Budweiser Clydesdale horses.
The American Quarter Horse is bred for speed and for distance, up to a quarter mile, and they are well suited to pulling wagons, buggies and sleighs.
The Canadian Horse was bred from horses shipped to Quebec from France in 1665. Their stamina and quiet temperament make this breed a perfect choice for carriage work.
Pairs of Quarter Horses and Canadians are used at the museum to pull smaller carriages up to six people.
Tack is also an important part of the carriage,
Don Remington made thousands of unique one of a kind tack...
The Remington Carriage Museum is part of a network of historic sites and museums in Alberta which include Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the Frank Slide Centre.

<doc id="20430062" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20430062" title="Creative peacebuilding">
Creative peacebuilding

Creative Peacebuilding is the larger name for creative therapies used to create peace, within individuals, groups, and societies. These therapies are used with many different demographic groups and in various types of situations. Although used primarily to overcome violence, creative peacebuilding can also be used as a preventative measure to make the foundations of peace stronger, especially when used with children. Creating an environment of lasting peace is the primary goal of peacebuilding.
Types of Creative Peacebuilding.
Music.
Music therapy can be used in several different fashions to build peace. It can be used to help individuals express themselves or to foster communication between individuals or groups of people. It can be used to nurture healing and reconciliation. Music is something that transcends language and national or ethnic boundaries. It has unique styles depending on the community it originates in and can also be adapted to fit individual's tastes. When two groups who have been in conflict or have the potential for conflict make music together communication and healing become possible. When individuals listen to or play music, they can reduce their stress levels and express their feelings.
Visual Art.
Visual art therapy can be used to help individuals cope with their feelings resulting from violent experiences. It is also used to treat Post-traumatic stress disorder. Art therapy is especially useful for people who are having trouble verbalizing their feelings and are keeping them bottled up. By sharing their experiences and processing them through a tactical and visual activity, people are able to heal. No prior experience with visual art is needed to participate in and gain benefits from art therapy —it is about the process of creation, not about the aesthetic appeal of the product. Art therapy can be used in group settings as well—creating a collaborative art project can be an experience that bridges differences between people and builds feelings of trust.
Visualization and Technology.
If people who have lived through traumatic or violent experiences can relive them and change the situation or their response to the situation they can come to terms with their past. Virtual technology and especially virtual reality simulations can be especially useful in cases like these and have been used to treat veterans of the Iraq war who are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. If the technology needed for these simulations is too expensive to be practical, mental visualization, in which the victim uses their imagination to create situations and feel as if they are gaining control of the way events play out, can be used as an alternative.
When it is Used.
When Working with Children.
Creative peacebuilding can be especially powerful when used with a young demographic. It lays the roots for a peaceful lifestyle when used with at-risk youth, and can help children who have already experienced trauma in their lives become fully functional adults. Art therapy has been used to help rehabilitate child soldiers in Uganda as well as to help children who lost their homes in the tsunami of 2004 cope with their feelings. Many youth centers catering to impoverished children use art forms to build community, discipline and trust.
Post-trauma.
Whether bringing about reconciliation between conflicting groups or allowing individuals to express their feelings so that they can move past the pain caused by violent events, creative peacebuilding is a necessary measure to bring society back to health and vibrancy. Because sometimes words are not sufficient to express grief, frustration, or pain, sometimes other methods are the most conducive to communication. This also allows health-care professionals to gain insight needed to treat individuals and to evaluate mental health and healing.
As a Preventative Measure.
The arts can be used to build peace before violence breaks out. It can be used to reinforce cooperation skills and develop proficiency in communications. It can overcome language barriers and make people more aware of points of view that are different from their own. Creative therapies can also allow individuals to feel connected to a community history or tradition and develop their own sense of constructive purpose. This helps to build lasting peace because when individuals are at peace with themselves and their own histories, conflict is less likely to arise within the community.
Who Provides Services.
Private therapy practices can provide services to foster creative peacebuilding, but more often it is facilitated through non-profits, religious organizations, and community centers or school systems. Although sometimes creative peacebuilding is used unilaterally, most of the time it is incorporated with already existing programs as part of a holistic approach to healing or community building.
Examples.
Create Peace Project.
Create Peace Project is an arts-for-peace education organization working to promote the practices of peace and spread the message of hope and goodwill to children around the world using creativity. Create Peace Project was founded in San Francisco, California in 2007 by artist and peace activist Ross Holzman in response to the overwhelming amount of violence in the world, on the news, and in our communities. Violence, coupled with the lack of creativity in peoples lives sparked the creation of projects such as Banners for Peace and The Peace Exchange. Create Peace Project has included more than 25,000 children from around the world in its arts-for-peace projects since its inception and continues to work with schools in the US and beyond promoting peace through creativity to children of all ages. www.createpeaceproject.org
Barefoot Artists.
Artist Lily Yeh has helped to heal the wounds genocide left on a village of widows and orphans through her work with Barefoot Artists. The members of the community were provided with a chance to honor their lost loved ones through their construction of a beautiful and expressive monument commemorating the mass grave of the local victims of the genocide. The construction process also provided a sense of closure to their mourning. Other aspects of the peacebuilding process in the village included paintings on building walls created by the village children of things that they hoped to see in the future as well as things important to their everyday existence. On the economic side of this peacebuilding effort, the people of the village learned how to mosaic and pour concrete, two useful and marketable skills to help provide economic stability.
River City Drum Corps.
In the United State, creative peacebuilding is used in many inner-city areas in places such as New York, Philadelphia, and Louisville. The River City Drum Corps in Louisville, Ky provides a musical outlet for children who perhaps are not listened to in other parts of their lives. It is also a structured program where discipline and the importance of both uniqueness and teamwork are taught. The children learn drumming patterns and perform for different events and groups of people throughout the city. Both the children in the program and their audience benefit from the cultural exchange and communication that take place during drum corps performances.

Blue-Spotted Grouper

Cephalopholis argus, also known as: Roi, Blue-spotted Grouper, Argus Grouper, Peacock Hind, Peacock Grouper or Peacock Rockcod is a fish from the Indo-Pacific which is variously a commercial gamefish, an invasive species and occasionally an aquarium resident. Its species name comes from its resemblance to the "hundred staring eyes" of the monster Argus in Greek mythology.
Description.
A medium sized fish that can reach a length of . Small individuals are dark brown with hundreds of small, dark-edged iridescent blue spots. Larger specimens sometimes develop four to six lighter vertical bars on the back half of its body.
Behavior.
Roi typically sit on a coral head, retreating when startled.
Red Sea males defend harems of 2-6 females in territories ranging up to . Each female defends part of the territory from the other females. The male visits each female daily, raising his dorsal fin to signal his approach. The females emerges from hiding, erecting her own dorsal fin and changing to a lighter color. They swim together, rubbing flanks before he departs until the next day.
Territorial disputes may involve "color fights" in which two males positioning themselves at right angles to each other. They then darken their color and repeatedly switch their bars from dark to light. The loser becomes pale and retreats. If the color fight ends in a draw, the two males may attack each other.
Reproduction.
In Micronesia, spawning usually occurs territorially at dusk. During courtship, both sexes darken except for a white keyhole-shaped patch at the center of the body.
Ecology.
Feeding.
Hunting, they lie on the bottom and surge forward, preferring juvenile surgeonfish and crustaceans. Alternatively they may hover motionless in the water column before attacking.
This grouper may follow and cooperate with another predator species, such as an octopus or eel or camouflage themselves in a school of surgeonfish. Multiple individuals may cooperate to harass an eel to get it to flush prey for them.
In the Red Sea, they hunt in the morning and evening.
In the aquarium.
"Cephalopholis argus" is a hardy aquarium fish for those who have a large marine aquarium. Its large size combined with its aggressive nature means it is best housed either alone or with other large aggressive fish such as lionfish, and moray eels. As a predator it will eat any smaller aquarium inhabitants such as damselfish.
In Hawaii.
Known in Hawaii as Roi, the state introduced them in the 1950s to enhance local fisheries. Hawaii’s Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR) finds that roi have become the reefs' dominant predator. The roi population there has increased 15 fold since the 1980s.
These predators threaten native reef fish such as parrotfish and goatfish. A University of Hawaii study estimated that in a three-square-mile area off the Kona Coast of Hawaii Island, roi eat of reef fish annually— equivalent to 8.2 million fish.
Ciguatera.
Prized as delicious eating in other Pacific regions, in Hawaii’s waters roi may contain the ciguatera toxin, which builds up in humans and causes serious illness.
Roundups.
On Maui spearfishers participate in "Roi Roundup" tournaments that target these problematic fish, attempting to reduce their numbers and impact.

Holtzberg was born in Israel to Nachman and Freida Holtzberg. He and his family moved to the Crown Heights neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, when he was nine years old. He had eight siblings. During his years in elementary school, he memorised the entire Second Order (Hebrew: Seder) of the Mishnah, Moed, verbatim and was a two-time champion in a competition of memorizing the Mishnah. During his high school years, Holtzberg was known for his knowledge of the Talmud. He traveled to Jerusalem for an international Talmudic competition, where he came in second.
He studied at yeshivas in New York and Argentina, and as a rabbinical student served communities in Thailand and China under the Summer Rabbinical Visitation Program run by Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, the educational arm of Chabad-Lubavitch.
Holtzberg had long desired to become a Chabad emissary. He spent time as a student in the Chabad house in Bangkok, and helped open a Chabad house in south Thailand.
His future rebbetzin, Rivka Holtzberg née Rosenberg (, born 1980, died 2008) was born in Israel to Rabbi Shimon and Yehudit Rosenberg, and was raised in Afula. She studied at a Bais Rivka seminary in Kfar Chabad, Israel. Her uncle was Rabbi Yitzchak Dovid Grossman, Chief Rabbi of Migdal Ha'Emek, Israel.
The Holtzbergs married in 2002. Their firstborn son, Menachem Mendel, was born a year later, afflicted with Tay-Sachs disease. He died of this disease at the age of 3. Their second son, DovBer, was born with the same ailment and was institutionalized in a pediatric long-term care facility in Israel under the care of his grandparents. He died at the age of 4 in December 2008, one month after his parents' murder. Their third son, Moshe, was born healthy and lived with them in Mumbai. They lived together on the fifth floor of the Chabad House. It was revealed by her father during her funeral that Rivka was five months pregnant with her fourth child at the time she was slain.
Work in Mumbai.
Chabad House.
After Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg married, they subsequently moved to Mumbai to serve as Chabad emissaries and open the first Chabad House in Mumbai. Under his leadership, he acquired the Nariman House. He ran the synagogue in addition to him and his wife being directors of the Chabad house, it was also the Mumbai Chabad headquarters. He installed a kosher kitchen and a mikvah at the Chabad house, and taught Torah, offered drug prevention services, and ran a hostel there. They led Shabbat meals every week at the Chabad house with between 50-60 people and 30-40 people per night during the week, where they hosted Jews from all walks of life from notable figures such as Sir Martin Gilbert and Rabbi Joseph Telushkin, to humanitarian workers, business people and Israeli backpackers visiting India.
In an article published in 2006, the Rabbi said he understood the nature of the Israeli traveler's needs saying they "need relief" from the army, from work, from real life. He said, "they come here to do everything the army didn’t allow them to do. Their shoes had to be polished and tied – here they wear sandals. They had to cut their hair – here they grow their hair long."
Local Jewish community.
Between 4,500 and 5,000 Jews live in Mumbai ("see Indian Jews"). Rabbi Holtzberg was a religious leader for that community, leading Friday night services at the Knesset Eliyahoo synagogue, also performing marriages for them, acting as the shochet (the kosher slaughtering of animals) and supplying the community with kosher meat, answering halakhic principles for them, such as what is to be done in the rites and customs of Judaism, as well as being a trained Mohel (performing the circumcision or "bris" of Jewish babies). In addition to helping to gather donations and do fund-raising for one of their synagogues, T'feret Israel, and helping them build an additional mikvah for that synagogue, he and his wife also taught Jewish studies and Torah to local Jews and tourists, and provided their mikveh to be used by local Jews, and made challah available to them.
Attack.
On Nov. 26, 2008, terrorists invaded the Chabad House and took the Holtzbergs hostage. Sandra Samuel, a cook at the house and the nanny for their two-year-old son, Moshe, managed to escape with the boy. As the siege began, Sandra locked the doors and hid in a room. She heard Rivka screaming, "Sandra, Sandra, help, Sandra," The gunmen reportedly went door-to-door, searching for targets, so Samuel unlocked her door, but they did not find her. She then ran upstairs to find the Holtzbergs shot and lying on the ground with their son crying over them, so she picked him up and ran to the exit. The Holtzbergs and other Israeli hostages were reportedly tortured by the terrorists.
Two days after the siege of the house began, Indian security forces seized the house and found the Holtzbergs and six others dead. It was concluded that the Rabbi's wife had been killed many hours before, and several of the bodies were covered in tallit, including Rivka Holtzberg, leading witnesses to speculate that the rabbi managed to cover the bodies before he was killed.
Response from the United States.
Several high-ranking American politicians released statements on the Mumbai attacks, specifically referencing Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg by name, including US President-elect Barack Obama, Senator Hillary Clinton, Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, and Governor David Paterson of New York.
Response from Australia.
In December 2008, Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd told more than 1,000 people at a memorial service at the Yeshiva Center in New South Wales that Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife, Rivkah, had “devoted their lives to acts of goodness and kindness and compassion for others ... but they lost their lives in a senseless act of hatred. In the face of this terror we must not bow to fear. We must respond by spreading our own message of tolerance and respect for people of other backgrounds and other beliefs.” Federal Opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull and U.S. Consul-General Judith Fergin also spoke at the memorial service. A representative from the Indian Consulate was also present.
In a speech to Federal Parliament, Michael Danby, a Jewish member of the Labor Party, said it was important to remember the names of the innocent victims of Mumbai attacks, stating that “I raise my voice in this national parliament and praise the memory of those innocent kedoshim who were killed in the Chabad House in Mumbai only because they were Jews.”
Funeral.
Thousands of people attended the funeral of Holtzberg and his wife, with eulogies delivered in the town of Kfar Chabad followed by a procession to Jerusalem's ancient Mount of Olives cemetery, where the couple was buried. Among those who attended were the two Chief Rabbis of Israel, President Shimon Peres, former Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak, former Prime Minister and Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu, several Shas ministers and MKs, government ministers, Knesset members, Chabad emissaries from around the world, the American and Indian ambassadors to Israel, and Rabbi Abraham Shemtov, head of Agudas Hassidei Chabad International, the movement's umbrella organization.
Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky vice chairman of Chabad's educational arm, "Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch", from New York, eulogized the couple at the funeral, saying "I vow that we will avenge the deaths of Gabi and Rivki. But not with AK-47s, not with grenades and tanks. We will take revenge in a different way. We will add light. We will add good deeds. We will make sure that there is not one Jewish man who does not put on tefillin. We will make sure that there is not one Jewish woman who does not light candles," speaking of one of the aims of the Chabad movement. Kotlarsky also said that the Chabad House would be rebuilt, and that it would be named after the Holtzbergs. Kotlarsky also aimed his message at the couple's surviving son, Moshe, saying "You don't have a mother who will hug you. You are the child of all of Israel." In Toronto, Ontario, Canada, a memorial service was held for the Gavriel and his wife at a Chabad synagogue, where almost 1,500 people attended.
Child.
The Holtzbergs' son Moshe, who survived the attack, and his nanny Sandra Samuel, subsequently moved to Israel where Moshe's grandparents live. The Israeli Government under Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni awarded Samuel a special visa offering immigration status. Samuel has stated she will continue to care for Moshe for as long as necessary. Israel is considering honouring her as a Righteous Gentile, the highest Israeli award that may be presented to non-Jews, allowing her to remain in Israel for an extended period of time.
A video of Moshe crying at the funeral service for his parents and crying "Imma, Imma," which means "Mommy, Mommy" in Hebrew was widely published.

Rhodogorgonales

The Rhodogorgonales are an order of red alga, a sister group to the corallines. They are always thalloid and calcified; their calcification is very different from the corallines, as individual calcite crystals are deposited in the cell wall of specialised cells; this suggests that the evolution of calcification may have been independent from the corallines. They have no fossil record.
Unlike the corallinales and sporolithales, their closest relatives, these thalli are loose aggregations of hair-like cells, with the middle portion formed of rhizoid-like filaments. Spores are borne on the end of hair-like cells (cortical fascicles).

Sick of Life

"Sick of Life" is a song by the Heavy Metal band Godsmack. It was released on the band's second studio album "Awake". The song is best known for its use in the U.S. Navy's "Accelerate Your Life" commercials, following a similar use of the album's title track. "Sick of Life" was written during Godsmack's tour supporting their self-titled album.
"Accelerate Your Life" commercials.
Godsmack frontman Sully Erna told ArthurMag.com about the use of "Sick of Life" in U.S. Navy commercials:
"The military came to us, believe it or not. Somebody in the Navy loves this band, because they used "Awake" for three years and then they came to us and re-upped the contract for another three years for "Sick of Life." So, I don’t know. They just feel like that music, someone in that place thinks that the music is very motivating for recruit commercials I guess."
War support.
However, Erna insists that Godsmack doesn't support any war:
"By no means has this band ever supported any war for any country or that we support government decisions or why we're sticking our nose in other people's business at times. What we support is our troops. And the women and men that go over there — or anywhere — to fight for our country and our lives and protect our freedom and I feel that."
"I actually sympathize with a lot of the soldiers, and the military in general, that are trained to go out and protect for us, and what they have to go through, it's really kind of shitty in a sense that these young kids have to go over there and die, sometimes, for something that isn't our problem. And that kind of sucks. So what I have to do is at least support them, because they don't have the choice that we do."
Some critics say that the band's young audience will now be influenced to join the military because of the popular tunes. However, Erna doubts very seriously that a kid is going to join the Marines or the US Navy because he heard Godsmack as the underlying bed music in the commercial.

Turn Hole Tunnel

The Turn Hole Tunnel is an abandoned railroad tunnel near Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. Built by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, it carried part of that railroad's main line until 1912, and was used as part of a passing siding for several decades thereafter. It is now an attraction in Lehigh Gorge State Park.
The tunnel takes its name from the "Turn Hole" in the Lehigh River, a deep eddy where the river makes a turn at the base of a high cliff, known as Moyer's Rock. When the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (a subsidiary of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company) extended its line from White Haven to Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe) in 1866, it crossed the Lehigh River at the Turn Hole and tunneled through the face of the cliff, proceeding southward through the gorge. The parallel line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad crossed the river just to the west, but swung around the point of Moyer's Rock instead of tunneling. The Lehigh and Susquehanna was leased to the Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1871.
The tunnel carried two tracks of the CNJ main line until about 1910, when it was condemned. The railroad began contracting to bypass it in 1911, grading a new alignment parallel with the Lehigh Valley. The new alignment was opened in 1912, but the two tracks in the tunnel and over the old bridge were kept intact as a passing siding until the 1950s, when they were abandoned.
The CNJ main line through Lehigh Gorge was abandoned in late 1964. While most of it has become the Lehigh Gorge Trail, the new alignment around Turn Hole Tunnel was paved as an access road to the Glen Onoko trail head of Lehigh Gorge State Park. The tunnel remains largely intact, with ties from the double track remaining "in situ", occasionally covered by rockfall. At the north portal, overlooking the river, a safety railing has been built across the tunnel. The piers of the old bridge still stand in the river.

Heliodorus of Catania (... – Catania, 778; , ) is a demi-legendary personage accused by his coevals of being a necromancer addicted to witchcraft.
Son of a noble Sicilian family, he at first professed his Christianity, and he was even a candidate to assume the "Episcopal Diocese of Catania". In that period the "Etnean City" came under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Roman Empire governed by then-Emperor Leo III the Isaurian.
Having failed to achieve this religious appointment, conferred on an Archdeacon 
from Ravenna (Saint Leo of Catania), he apostatized to begin taking an interest in magic. Leo later became a ""Saint"", a ""Miracles' Operator"", and the ""Fifteenth Bishop of Catania"".
Besides the accusation of necromancy, Heliodorus was pointed to as an ""idolmaker"" and ""a Disciple of Jews"". He remained a vocal opponent of Saint Leo the Thaumaturgus (=""The Wonderworker""), Bishop from 765 to 785 AD.

Somersall Hall

Somersall Hall is a small country house near Brampton, Chesterfield, Derbyshire. It is a Grade II listed building.
The Clarke family owned the estate in the 16th century. Godfrey Clarke and his son Sir Gilbert Clarke served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1652 and 1676 respectively. Sir Gilbert bought an additional estate at Chilcote Hall in 1672. His son Godfrey Clarke was Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. He left the estate to his nephew, also Godfrey Clarke, who lived at Chilcote, was High Sheriff in 1740, bought Sutton Scarsdale Hall and built a new house at Somersall.
The new house was built in 1763 on the site of an earlier 17th-century house and incorporates some of the early features. The new work created a three-storey three-bayed house with an east-facing entrance front. In the 19th century a two-storey wing was added to the north of the frontage.
Sutton became the family seat and Somersall was let out as a farmhouse. Godfrey Bagnall Clarke died without issue and his estates passed to his sister and then to her daughter who married Walter Butler, 18th Earl of Ormonde. On the Earls death in 1824 the estates were broken up.
The Hall has had many owners and occupiers since that time. Eliot Stanton is one of these.

Historic Blakeley State Park

Historic Blakeley State Park is a park located on the site of the former town of Blakeley in Baldwin County, Alabama on the Tensaw River delta. The park encompasses an area once occupied by settlers in what was a thriving community on the river. Later, Confederate soldiers were garrisoned here and fought in the last major battle of the U.S. Civil War against superior Union forces.
History.
The park was created in 1976 as a private not-for-profit foundation. The goal was to preserve and re-develop the area. In 1981, the Alabama Legislature named Blakeley a state park and created a separate state authority to oversee operations. Although it is called a state park, it is not operated by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. State funding was suspended during 2011, and the park is now fully funded by private contributions and gate receipts.
In 1993, Blakeley was named a Class A Civil War site by the United States Congress. The park is part of the Civil War Discovery Trail due to it being the site of the Battle of Fort Blakely. Some remnants of battlefield operations remain including the Confederate breastworks that cross the park. Some effort is underway to restore the Confederate and Union constructs that supported the Battle of Fort Blakeley. That battle, involving over 16,000 soldiers occurred on the same day as the Confederate surrender. African-American troops made up a significant number of the Union forces.
Little evidence remains today of the previous town of Blakeley. A few historical markers designate important locations such as brick kiln and an old oak tree used as a hanging tree for the local courts. A river crossing here once linked Mobile and Baldwin counties. Prior to the establishment of the town of Blakeley, an ancient Native American village existed and, later, a large plantation occupied this location.
Location and activities.
The park is located on Alabama 225 just north of the town of Spanish Fort, Alabama. The park is bounded on the east by the highway and by the river to the west. Mobile, Alabama can be seen in the distance across the river. Camping, both primitive and RV, is available year round. Group campsites are also available. Numerous picnic areas and over ten miles (16 km) of hiking trails are found within the park. The park charges a fee for admission and for camping. A motorized launch takes guests on a tour of the delta region during warmer months.
Gatra Wehle Nature Center.
The Gatra Wehle Nature Center, located on Green Street in Historic Blakeley State Park, features conservation and environmental educational exhibits about the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta. The building includes an audiovisual theater and conference area/exhibit room.

Castell Du

Castell Du, also known as Sennybridge Castle or Castell Rhyd-y-Briw, is located approximately eight miles west of Brecon in Powys, Wales, and is believed to be the work of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales. Its history is largely obscure, but a reference to a castle at Rhyd-y-Briw in a document of 1271 is believed to refer to the fortification, and it is not unreasonable to assume that work commenced on it during Llywelyn's triumphal years in the 1260s. Its life would seem to have been short, as there is no further reference to it in thirteenth-century documents, and it seems likely that it was captured by the forces of Edward I of England during the war of 1276-7 and subsequently abandoned. Much of the site remains to be excavated; the remains of a D-shaped tower are visible, and two other towers may lie under pill-boxes erected during the Second World War.

Global Hands-On Universe

In a paper published in 2007 by Dr. Carl Pennypacker, the Global Hands-On Universe (GHOU) is presented as an educational program that enables students to investigate the Universe while applying tools and concepts from science, math, and technology. Using the Internet, G-HOU participants around the world request observations from an automated telescope, download images from a large image archive, and analyze them with the aid of user-friendly image processing software, as described by Dr. Miller. 
About.
Global Hands-On Universe is a worldwide project, with extensions over all the continents, the root project being GHOU. The project is based on observations, possibly acquired by the pupils themselves in classrooms thanks to a worldwide network of automatic telescopes operated via Internet or didactic tools (webcam system, radio telescope) developed within this project. These observations can be manipulated in classrooms with a specific software designed to be pupil-friendly. They are integrated into pedagogical resources constructed in a close collaborative work between researchers and teachers. The resources developed in the course of this project are posted on the Web site.
History.
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) launched in 2009 the Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP), a Cornerstone project of the International Year of Astronomy 2009. GHOU is a major component of GTTP.
GHOU, among which EU-HOU is the leading consortium, is now officially included in the Astronomy for the Developing World Strategic Plan 2010-20 of IAU, under Section 3.4.2 Astronomy for Children and Schools. During the next decade the IAU will concentrate more resources on education activities for children and schools designed to advance sustainable global development.
In Europe, the EU-HOU project is led by Dr. Ferlet & Dr A.-L. Melchior. EU-HOU has been funded through the European Community (EC) program MINERVA (SOCRATES) for a two-year period (2004–2006), and through the European Community (EC) program COMENIUS (LifeLong Learning Program) for two two-year periods (2008–2010, 2010-2012). EU-HOU has extended up to 15 EC countries, with national websites. The Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris is the educational centre for the EU-HOU project. The EU-HOU project has developed numerous (free) pedagogical resources tested in classrooms and posted on the project's website. The most ambitious ones are: (1) the multilingual SalsaJ software: it enables secondary school pupils to handle astronomical data and analyse them. An exercise series based on this software has been developed. Associated data can be downloaded directly from the software. (2) The EUHOUMW Small Radiotelescope Network developed in the framework of the Comenius project "Connecting classrooms to the Milky Way" enables secondary school pupils to access the instruments installed in five different European countries (France, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain). Kids can observe the hydrogen from the Milky Way with these 3-metres radiotelescopes. Every operation can be performed from the Web interface, available in 17 different languages, which enables the learners to reconstruct the rotation curve of the Milky Way as well as its spiral arms. Pedagogical resources (teacher's manual, simulator of observation, archives, kinesthetic activities) have been tested in teacher's training, secondary school level and also at undergraduate level. 
In America, the US HOU project is led by the USA with support from the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy. In the USA, HOU has developed and pilot tested an educational program that enables high school students to request their own observations from professional observatories. Students download telescope images to their classroom computers and use the powerful HOU image processing software to visualize and analyze their data. High school curriculum developed by HOU integrates many of the science and math topics and skills outlined in national standards into open-ended astronomical investigations. HOU has also developed activities and tools for middle school students and products for informal science education centers. The Lawrence Hall of Science at University of California, Berkeley, is the educational center for the HOU project.
In Asia, the AS-HOU section have China and Japan strongly involved. They have their own web sites.
In Africa, AF-HOU is now extending to Kenya with a recently launched pilot, researchbased astronomy and astrophysics curriculum into Kenya High in Nairobi, Kenya as a vehicle to introducing the methodologies of scientific research into secondary education.
Teacher training sessions.
In the context of the European Commission Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013, EU-HOU proposes regular European training sessions in France, at Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University in Paris, since 2010. These sessions are published on the Comenius training database (reference numbers: FR-2010-314-003, FR-2011-359-006, FR-2013-408-003).
The main goal of these training sessions is to re-awake the interest for science in the young generation with inquiry-based methods. Active methods based e.g. on kinesthesia (Proprioception) have been recently introduced to introduce modelling concepts. Renewing of the teaching of science is fulfilled through astronomy as a well-established source of motivation, and through the use of new Information and Communication Technologies - ICT. Involving teachers in a variety of research-based astronomical projects, they will get excited, enthused and motivated to teach science/technology/maths. The training is intended to enhance basic competencies of teachers and develop higher level skills and expertise, primarily in Information and communication technologies in education (ICT), maths and physics area. 
These sessions are financed through European Commission Comenius national Agencies (Comenius programme). Information related to scheduled training sessions are posted on the EU-HOU Website and its news. 
A dedicated forum in English has been opened to favour feed-back from trained teachers and interaction with a wider educator and researcher community.

<doc id="20430612" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20430612" title="SureSmile">
SureSmile

SureSmile is a type of braces used by orthodontists to straighten teeth. With SureSmile the orthodontist combines 3-D imaging, treatment planning software and a robot to create the wires. The technique is reported in "ORTHODONTICS The Art and Practice of Dentofacial Enhancement" to decrease the time required to complete orthodontic treatment by 34% and increase the precision of the results.
Design.
The orthodontists first take digital images of a patient's mouth and teeth using either a white light scanner or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). The 3D scanner transforms physical teeth into virtual teeth. The virtual model enables the orthodontist to visualize teeth not only from the front as with conventional orthodontics, but from all angles seeing roots, gums, things they never would have seen before without the imaging and software. Then as described on the Science Channel, with the software tools the orthodontist takes the teeth and individually aligns them into the proper position. Dr. Michael B. Stewart an orthodontist at Atlanta Orthodontic Specialists explained on Good Morning America that “have more control over how these teeth are moved than [they ever had before." 
Once the orthodontist has virtually designed the smile and bite, SureSmile software plans the most efficient and direct route for moving teeth into the proper place and sends this information to a robot that bends and shapes the wires specifically for that patient. The wire with all of the custom bends is then sent back to the 
orthodontist ready to place on the patient.
SureSmile 6.0.
SureSmile 6.0 released in March 2012 is the most important update since the SureSmile orthodontic treatment system was developed. SureSmile 6.0 provides orthodontists with 3-D data illustrating the positions in which tooth roots fit into surrounding bone. 
Until now, orthodontists could only estimate how their treatment will affect root positions in the supporting bone. Orthodontists can now use 3 planes of space to simulate outcomes with respect to bone and they can know if the roots will be in the target zone prior to executing a plan. 
SureSmile 6.0 also enhances an orthodontists ability to collaborate with oral surgeons and dentists by providing interactive data models that integrate with surgical and restorative planning.
Outcome quality.
Note: Both studies used consecutively treated, non-extraction cases.
Treatment time and cost.
The range of treatment time for SureSmile varies from patient to patient. Generally however, finish times with SureSmile range from 6 months to 20 months. In the study also referenced above, it was shown that on average SureSmile treatment is completed 33% faster than conventional treatment. The cost of SureSmile varies from orthodontist to orthodontist. Some orthodontists include the cost of using SureSmile in their standard fees and some charge a separate fee. The price variance typically ranges fro 0-10%.
Lingual braces.
SureSmile has a lingual or behind teeth braces option called SureSmile QT. With lingual braces, brackets are adhered to the underside of the teeth on the to arch, bottom arch or both arches. Most patients choose lingual braces for aesthetic reasons, as they cannot be seen. Orthodontists that offer lingual braces will often suggest putting lingual braces on the upper teeth and clear ceramic braces on the bottom though patients can choose to have lingual braces on both arches. A news segment on WGN-TV Medical Watch recently featured SureSmile QT and explains that the same SureSmile robotic technology is used for the behind teeth braces.
History.
The SureSmile technology was developed and is owned by OraMetrix, a company founded in 1998 through the merger of two medical technology companies, one U.S. based and the other German. The company was launched globally in 1999 with the help of a $150,000 investment from STARTech Early Ventures LLC. Other key investors include Brentwood Venture Capital, CenterPoint Ventures, Rho Ventures and STAR Ventures. 
The SureSmile System received 510K marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2000. In 2003, OraMetrix relocated its U.S. corporate headquarters from Dallas to a larger, 25,000-square-foot facility in Richardson, Texas. Today, more than 100,000 patients have received or are in treatment with SureSmile at over 400 practices nationwide.
Further reading and studies.
The editor of Techno Bytes, Dr. Robert Scholz, provides an in-depth interview with the Chief Clinical Officer of OraMetrix, Inc., Dr. Rohit Sachdeva.
According to the study, when compared with conventional finishing, SureSmile patients had significantly lower DI scores, less treatment time (,7 months), and better CRE scores for first-order alignment-rotation and interproximal space closure.
Dr. Ed Lin gives an in-depth lingual case study using SureSmile QT.
The research shows that the SureSmile process results in a lower mean ABO OGS score and a reduced treatment time than conventional approaches with great potential to both decrease treatment time and improve quality.
This article describes the use of both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ tools in managing the orthodontic care of a patient with SureSmile technology.

Mary Taylor (Coronation Street)

Mary Taylor (previously Gibbs) is a fictional character from the British soap opera, "Coronation Street" played by Patti Clare, who made her first onscreen appearance on 26 November 2008 and departed on 15 May 2009 but returned in March 2010 and has appeared on the show ever since. The character of Mary was originally a guest character who appeared in November 2008, as a love interest for Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden). The character proved popular and was brought back in 2009 for another short stint. She was brought back full-time in 2010.
Storylines.
Backstory.
Mary was bullied at school by a girl named Tracy O'Connor. She was physically and mentally bullied, with Tracy chanting, "Hairy Mary, Fat and Scary" while holding Mary by her hair. This left Mary emotionally scarred for life, as she regularly explains to the residents of Coronation Street about her bullying days. Her mother, Maureen, brought Mary up unusually, telling her always to have fish suppers on the last Friday of every month.
2008-09.
In 2008, Mary begins to visit Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) regularly after initially being his rival in a series of competitions. Norris's fellow lodger, Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope), enjoys flirting with her, but Mary only has eyes for Norris. Norris invites her to his home for Christmas. Near the end of January 2009, Mary returns, telling Norris they have won a motor home. Norris is pleased, but begins to be concerned about how far she wants to take their relationship. On 13 February, in the Rovers, they say an awkward goodbye to each other, Mary is expecting a kiss or a hug from Norris, but gets nothing, leaving her devastated. 
2010—.
In March, she returns and she asks Norris if he would like to go travelling. This leaves his friends Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) and Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) unsure how they'd feel if he left. In April, Mary tells Norris that her mother has died but she admits that she feels a sense of relief as she had been a very domineering woman. On 15 May, she and Norris say goodbye, as she sets off to travel around the world. She drives off in the motor home, but not before promising to keep in touch with Norris via postcards.
Norris begins doing competitions with Emily's niece Freda (Ali Briggs), and they both win £1,000. They get a picture taken before splitting the money and Freda leaves the street. However, Mary reads it and returns to Weatherfield and surprises Norris. After briefly meeting him, she goes up to Scotland, but returns a few days later. When Norris begins getting tired and needing a break, Mary suggests that she does some work in The Kabin so he can take a break. Mary enters a competition for them and if they win, they would win a week at a cottage in the countryside. She manages to win it and persuades Norris to attend, which he agrees to. Norris is delighted when Rita returns to Weatherfield and offers her a job at The Kabin. She volunteers to look after the shop when he goes away with Mary. During a night at the cottage, Norris thinks that she is trying to ensure that he cannot escape, like Paul in the Stephen King novel "Misery". He even witnesses Mary saying that the two of them are married - a horrific thought for Norris. He becomes even more scared of Mary's antics when he hears her talking to her "dead" mother who it later transpires is alive. Norris then calls the police and Mary is taken to the station for holding Norris against his will. However, just when Norris thinks he has evaded Mary, she is released from the police station and returns to Weatherfield to try to make amends with Norris who wants nothing more to do with her. She also has made several attempts to try to talk to Norris since the event but he refuses to listen. 
On 10 May 2010, she attends Blanche Hunt's (Maggie Jones) funeral and also tries to talk to Norris. However, he leaves to go to The Kabin. On 31 May, she turns up at Gail Platt's (Helen Worth) trial for the murder of Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale), and sits behind Norris in the court and again tries to talk to him. Mary and Norris quickly begin gossiping about the trial and are present for the duration, much to the annoyance of the Platts and Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). On the day of the verdict she bets Norris £5 that Gail would be found guilty. She then forms a friendship with Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) and offers her assistance with the preparations for her forthcoming marriage to Roy Cropper (David Neilson). Mary quickly begins to hijack the situation - picking very expensive venues and dresses. Hayley tries to tell her to back down but finds it very difficult, much to Roy's annoyance. On 30 August, Mary, upset at not being invited to Roy and Hayley's wedding, unbuckles the bolt keeping Hayley's carriage on the steam train that they were travelling to the church in. Later, Mary's motor home was stolen, and she launches her own investigation, believing Gary Windass (Mikey North) is responsible. Kylie Turner (Paula Lane) turns out to be the one responsible for the theft but the motor home is returned the following morning to Mary's delight.
Realising there is no possible romance with Norris, in the summer of 2012, Mary begins playing chess with Roy but her feelings run deeper than the game. She develops feelings for him but he does not notice. Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) does and she warns Mary to stay away from Roy. However Mary later realises that Roy deeply and truly loves Hayley and so Mary decides to stop pursuing Roy. When Mary sends Roy and Hayley away on a holiday, she manages the café. Mary attempts to get more customers in by doing a Spanish-themed evening, which is a success. As Mary starts doing more themed nights, this angers Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), Gail Platt (Helen Worth), David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) and Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) as they lose customers at their Bistro. When Kylie calls Mary a 'greasy spoon', she decides to do her themed nights daily which angers Anna. When Mary decides to do seating upstairs in Roy and Hayley's flat, Anna walks out on her, so Mary employs Norris for 'French Night'. As Mary bosses Norris around, he mocks her and walks out on Mary, much to the delight of David and Kylie.
After Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) dies suddenly, Mary helps out at the Alahan household by babysitting Sunita's children, Aadi (Zennon Ditchett) and Asha (Tanisha Gorey). Mary also helps Sunita's husband Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) through grief and the children take a shine to her. Mary also helps out when Norris' lodger Emily falls off a ladder and badly injures her leg. Mary catches Faye Windass (Ellie Leach) stealing from Dev's corner shop and stops her with the aid of Dev's colleague and friend, Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent). Mary cooks her some noodles and tries to get Faye to talk, but she leaves the shop quickly. In November 2013, Faye and her friend Grace Piper (Ella-Grace Gregoire) plot revenge on Mary after she lectures them about not eating enough fruit and vegetables. Faye and Grace then start throwing stones at Mary's motorhome, so she confides in Norris and Emily. The trio catch Grace and Faye graffiting on the motorhome, so Grace runs off, and Faye is caught. Faye's guardian Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) apologises to Mary, so she confides in him about the days when she enduring both physical and mental bullying from children at school. She then orders for an apology from Faye.
Mary is upset in 2014 when she learns that Hayley has died. She tries to help Hayley's husband, Roy, through grief and attends Hayley's funeral. When Roy disappears, Mary helps Anna and Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) find him.
Creation and development.
Casting.
The character was introduced for a specific storyline as both herself and Norris have an obsession with entering competitions. Mary lives with and takes care of her disabled mother and uses the competitions as a way to enjoy life. Norris initially resents Mary, as she often beats him in competitions, but when they meet, they quickly become close, and Mary offers Norris one of the tickets she has won for a Cliff Richard concert.
In May 2009, it was reported that Mary had been axed form "Coronation Street" due to cost cuts but executives have denied reports that characters have been axed from the show in order to cut back on costs. Corrie producers this afternoon insisted that the departing characters were only ever intended to remain with the show for the duration of their ongoing storylines, which all happen to come to an end within the next few weeks. A show spokesperson said: "The affected actors were all involved in storylines that were due to run for a finite time. If every new character stayed in the show, the Street would be a little crowded to say the least." In September 2009, it was announced Patti Clare was to reprise her role as Mary Taylor. A spokesperson confirmed: "Mary will be back to rekindle her relationship with Norris."
Storyline development.
Malcolm Hebden (Norris Cole) said in an interview with the soap's official website, the star claimed that his friendship with Clare makes it easier to create chemistry and humorous moments when they film scenes together. Hebden commented, "I think when Patti and I get together it's comedy all the way. We love working together which is a good start for comedy. Oddly enough, you can play a love relationship with someone you hate - I've done it - but comedy you can't do. So I love her to death and it helps with the comedy."
Pattie Clare revealed that she was obsessed with joining the cast of "Coronation Street". She said, "I used to write and write to the casting director asking for a job and he'd write back saying, 'Nothing doing at the moment'. I could really see myself in Corrie and was very persistent." She confessed that she had been so desperate to land a role that she had created a new character and written a scene for her. "So I wrote him a scene making up a character for myself called Cherise, who was to be Raquel's half-sister," she said. "She sat in the bar and didn't say anything and wore glasses and was quite dowdy and then Raquel gives her a make-over. I thought it was brilliant, but he wrote back and said, 'No, no, no, no, no, it's not going to happen'." "I had a lot of theatre experience, but I'd wanted to go into television for a while. I was told I had to take a gamble for a year and turn theatre work down and sit it out," she explained. "It was terrible. I didn't do any acting for nine months so I worked in an office and the job came in the September."
Reception.
For her portrayal of Mary, Clare was nominated for Funniest Performance at the 2010 and 2011 Inside Soap Awards. She lost out to Tameka Empson who plays Kim Fox in "EastEnders" in 2011 Clare won Best Comedy Performance at the British Soap Awards in 2011. Of Mary, the "Daily Mail's" Jaci Stephen stated "Every time she opens her mouth, a gem pours forth. The writers do a great job with this character, but it is also Patti Clare's exquisite delivery that induces side-splitting hilarity – and, brilliantly, hilarity laced with a sense of the sinister."

Milton Keynes urban area

Milton Keynes is a large town in (ceremonial) Buckinghamshire. The Milton Keynes urban area or Milton Keynes Built-up Area is a designation established by the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics. As with other urban areas, it includes settlements that regard themselves as being outside Milton Keynes. 
2011 Urban sub-areas.
These are the subdivisions of the Milton Keynes urban area (built-up area):<br>
2001 Urban sub-areas.
Unlike other long established towns and cities that have historic boundaries which the ONS can use, Milton Keynes does not have any such readily usable boundaries and consequently it is assigned a number of new urban sub-areas. Accordingly, it has defined a Milton Keynes urban area to be composed of the contiguous built environment, with 'urban sub-areas' that map to the original urban and rural districts (and sometimes to the chronological phases of urbanisation within them).
Some of the "Urban Sub-areas" largely match the boundaries of the legacy local government areas that existed before its 1967 designation as a "new town". These were:
The corresponding modern Urban Sub-areas (with links to the relevant articles) are
Newport Pagnell Rural was subdivided as development proceeded
The fragment of Winslow Rural in the designated area, Shenley Church End, was added to "Central Milton Keynes Urban Sub-area".
Note that the areas covered by these Urban Sub-area designations are larger (sometimes far larger) than the modern districts that share their names. This is particularly true of Central Milton Keynes US-a.
The Milton Keynes urban boundary.
Although Milton Keynes does not have statutory boundary, the 1967 "Designated Area" boundary (plus subsequent expansions to the east, north and west) is treated as the de facto boundary. This contains the ONS Urban Sub-areas of Bletchley, Wolverton/Stony Stratford, Central Milton Keynes, North Milton Keynes, Walnut Tree and Browns Wood.

Introducing A. R. Rahman

Introducing A. R. Rahman is a compilation album of score and songs composed by Chennai film composer A. R. Rahman. It was released in 2006 on Times Square Records. It includes excerpts from soundtracks spanning 1993–2001 that changed the face of Indian film music and the cinema of India. "Introducing A. R. Rahman" features twenty-five tracks compiled by Iain Scott, taken from seventeen pictures in Tamil cinema.
Indian compositional forms, instrumentation, with train whistles, bells, looped bee–like vocals and dramatic percussion are coupled with orchestral sweeps and Carnatic accents with veena, pullanguzhal and chanting employed on the tracks.
Reception.
Richie Unterberger writing for AllMusic felt that the net grouping of tracks "by intention or design is not to establish an identifiable style, but to demonstrate Rahman's versatility," saying it was a contrast to the "stereotypes many viewers have of the flashy, sometimes cheesy music heard in much Indian cinema, the material here is thoughtfully assembled and dignified."

Hildenbrandiales

Hildenbrandiales is an order of crustose forms red alga which bear conceptacles and produce secondary pit-connections. They reproduce by vegetative gemmae as well as tetrasporangia, which are produced inside the conceptacles. The way in which the tetraspores are produced is unusual enough to justify the formation of this distinct order.
Some members of the order are known from freshwater rivers as well .
Systematics.
Hildenbradiales are difficult to discriminate on morphological grounds; tetrasporangia morphology is the only vaguely reliable character, but molecular techniques have indicated a monophyletic "Apophlaea" within a paraphyletic "Hildenbrandia", with many "Hildenbrandia" species being recognized as non-monophyletic.

McColo

McColo was a San Jose-based web hosting service provider. In late 2008, the company was shut down by the two upstream providers, Global Crossing and Hurricane Electric, because a significant amount of malware and botnets had been trafficking from the McColo servers.
History.
McColo was formed by a 19-year-old Russian hacker and student named Nikolai. Nikolai's nickname was "Kolya McColo;" hence the name of the provider.
Malware traffic.
At the time of termination of its upstream service on November 11, 2008, it was estimated that McColo customers were responsible for a substantial proportion of all email spam then flowing and subsequent reports claim a two-thirds or greater reduction in global spam volume. This reduction had been sustained for some period after the takedown. McColo was one of the leading players in the so-called "bulletproof hosting" market — ISPs that will allow servers to remain online regardless of complaints.
According to "Ars Technica" and other sources, upstream ISPs Global Crossing and Hurricane Electric terminated service when contacted by Brian Krebs and "The Washington Post"’s "Security Fix" blog, but multiple reports had been published by organisations including SecureWorks, FireEye and ThreatExpert, all naming McColo as the host for much of the world's botnet traffic. According to Joe Stewart, director of malware research for SecureWorks, the Mega-D, Srizbi, Pushdo, Rustock and Warezov botnets all hosted their master servers at McColo; numerous complaints had been made but McColo simply moved offending servers and sites to different subnets. Spamhaus.org reportedly finds roughly 1.5 million computers infected with either Srizbi or Rustock sending spam in an average week.
Following the shut down, details began to emerge of the ISP's other clients, which included distributors and vendors of child pornography and other criminal enterprises, including the notorious Russian Business Network.
McColo gained reconnection briefly on November 19, 2008 via a backup connection agreement common in the industry, but was rapidly shut down again.
The McColo takedown especially affected Srizbi, the world's largest botnet, with around 500,000 infected nodes as of November 2008. The botnet is reported to be capable of sending around 60 billion spam messages a day, which is more than half of the global total of 100 billion.
Symantec's monthly state of spam report for April 2009 stated that spamming was now back to what it was before McColo was taken offline. Due to botnets being created and old ones being brought back online, it estimated that about 85 percent of all email traffic is spam.

<doc id="20430828" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20430828" title="Bernstein–Mahler cycle">
Bernstein–Mahler cycle

The Bernstein–Mahler cycle usually refers to two separate audio recordings of the symphonies of composer Gustav Mahler, as performed by conductor/composer Leonard Bernstein in the 1960s and 1980s respectively.
The First Cycle.
Bernstein's first Mahler cycle was the first (of now many) complete Mahler cycles with symphonies 1-9 recorded between 1960 and 1967 on the CBS now Sony label. Although they were not the first recordings of the individual symphonies, Bernstein's advocacy was an important part of the Mahler boom of the 1960s (especially in the US) and helped increase the popularity of the less commonly played symphonies like the third, sixth, and seventh. The cycle used performances by the New York Philharmonic—the same orchestra that Mahler led during a brief tenure between 1909 and his death in 1911—as well as a performance of the 8th symphony by the London Symphony Orchestra. Bernstein subsequently re-recorded Symphony No. 2 for CBS with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1973; sometimes this recording has been included in CD editions of the cycle. Bernstein refused to conduct the complete tenth, rendered posthumously from Mahler's sketches by the musicologist Deryck Cooke, although he did record the opening adagio with the New York Philharmonic in the 1970s.
The Second Cycle.
Bernstein's second Mahler cycle recorded for Deutsche Grammophon took advantage of the newly developed digital recording technologies of the 1980s. The new cycle also involved recordings by orchestras closely linked to Mahler's compositional and conductorial output, including the New York Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Bernstein utilized his preferred latter-day technique of recording several live performances with patchup sessions to correct minor mistakes, believing it to be more satisfactory than a full studio recording. The 8th symphony was still to be recorded at the time of Bernstein's death, and a 1975 radio tape of a Salzburg Festival performance was used to complete the cycle. The performances of the fifth and first symphonies are often seen by critics as an improvement over the first cycle, as well as the recording of the fourth, despite sharp criticism of Bernstein's use of a boy soprano in the fourth movement. Although there are many similarities between the two cycles, Bernstein's later conducting style is often slower and more heavily expressive that his more youthful approach in the 1960s.
Other Recordings.
In addition to the two audio cycles, Bernstein recorded a filmed cycle for Unitel in the 1970s with the Vienna Philharmonic and the London Symphony Orchestra (in Symphony 2 - in conjunction with the audio recording by CBS mentioned above). The film of the 8th symphony (recorded in Vienna) is a different performance to the Salzburg performance released in the second audio cycle.
Bernstein made two recordings of "Das Lied von der Erde": in Vienna (1966) for Decca and in Israel (1972) for CBS. He also made various recordings of Mahler's song cycles including "Kindertotenlieder" and "Lieder aus "Des Knaben Wunderhorn" (The Youth's Magic Horn)".
Since Bernstein's death, several other Mahler recordings have emerged from broadcast sources and have been released commercially, including a Second Symphony with the Orchestre de Radio France from 1958, and a Ninth Symphony with the Berlin Philharmonic from 1979.

Berwickshire High School

Berwickshire High School is a six-year comprehensive school located west of Duns, Scotland.
History.
It was first opened in 1896, by Walter John Mabbott, who was the first Rector of the school. It started out with accommodation for 80 pupils in which extensions were built on to accommodate the rise in pupil numbers.
By the 1950s the school had become very overcrowded so plans were made to create a new school. The new school opened in 1958. 
The school has a large catchment area stretching all over Berwickshire including Duns, Greenlaw, Chirnside, Coldstream, Foulden, Paxton, Eccles, Leitholm and Swinton. 
The school motto is from the famous poem Ulysses, ""To Strive, To Seek, To Find and not to yield"" basically meaning to make the most of your life.
House system.
The school has four 'houses' into which the students are split. This is not only a way to organise classes but is also intended to encourage a rivalry, being the basis of inter-house competitive events. The houses are named after notable people from Berwickshire. The three original houses were Scott, Home and Douglas and in 2008 the fourth house, Clark, was created (named after racing driver Jim Clark). Each has its own colour, Head of House (Staff), House Captains and Vice Captains (derived from pupils in S5/S6) and House Representatives. Each earn points throughout the year in which the winner will receive the Interhouse Trophy.
Change of buildings.
The new high school was officially opened in February 2009. Work started in October 2006 on the new school which is located opposite the old building. The design was similar to Eyemouth High School and Earlston High School which were all built at the same time under a Public Private Partnership with the Scottish Borders Council.

Iraqi Status of Forces Agreement referendum, 2010

A referendum on the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the United States and Iraq was due to be held in Iraq in 2010. Contrary to expectations, it was not held on 7 March 2010 together with parliamentary elections; it was originally due on 30 July 2009.
Agreement.
The Agreement was necessary as the legal authority for the presence of the United States' troops - the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1790 - expired on 31 December 2008. 
Under the agreement, the United States' Army must withdraw from all cities by mid-2009 and from Iraq altogether by the end of 2011. Iraqi courts will be able to try crimes committed by off-duty soldiers outside their bases. The United States would not be allowed to use Iraq as a base to attack any other state - a response to a recent bombing of Syria - and the Iraqi Army would have control over the operations and movements of the United States' army.
The Prime Minister of Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki, said the agreement would restore "full sovereignty" to Iraq by 2011.
The draft Bill was approved by the Council of Ministers of Iraq on 16 November and sent to the Council of Representatives for approval. The agreement was initialled by Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker on 17 November.
Before the vote in the Council of Representatives of Iraq, the most senior cleric, Ali al-Sistani, said the agreement should have ""broad consensus"" across all political groups. Following this call, the al-Maliki government tried to persuade the Sunni Arab parties to support the agreement, despite having a sufficient majority in parliament without them.
When the bill came up for its second reading in November, many MPs left the country to go on the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. This was strongly criticised by Sistani, who said MPs should ""assume their national and historical responsibility to give their opinion frankly about the agreement"". When first debated the vote was shouted down by opponents from the Sadrist Movement, but it was passed the following day.
The Sunni Arab coalitions, the Iraqi Accord Front and the Iraqi National Dialogue Front were reported to be concerned that the departure of the United States' Army would allow the Shi'ite majority to dominate them. They called for the end of the prosecution of Baath party members, the abolition of the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal and that the agreement be put to a referendum the following year. In the end the Maliki government agreed to the referendum and the two groups dropped their other demands. 
The small Islamic Virtue Party and the Iraqi National Dialogue Front also opposed the agreement, arguing it ""infringed Iraqi sovereignty"" 
If the referendum result would have been against the SOFA, the Iraqi government would have given notice to end the agreement and US troops would have been required to leave Iraq within one year. "If the Iraqi people reject the pact in the referendum ... the government of Iraq will be committed, according to the law, to the result of the referendum and will convey this will to the American administration. The pact will be annulled," Iraq's Sunni Vice-President Tareq al-Hashemi said. The deal can be terminated if either signatory gives the other side a year's notice.

American Hellenic Institute

The American Hellenic Institute ("AHI"') is a Greek American organization created in 1974 to strengthen US-Greece and US-Cyprus relations, as well as relations within Hellenic-American community. The group has a lobbying focus, which distinguishes it from the other organizations associated with AHI.
History.
The American Hellenic Institute was created on August 1, 1974, by Eugene Rossides in response to the Turkish occupation of Cyprus. The Institute argued that Turkey had violated the US Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Foreign Military Sales Act, in that Turkish forces were purportedly using American weapons. They called upon Henry Kissinger, who would be a perennial obstacle to the AHI's goals, to condemn Turkey and to deny it further sales and aid until all Turkish troops were withdrawn from the soil of Cyprus. This petition was denied, but under continued pressure from AHI, Congress decided on an arms embargo toward Turkey. In December 1974, an AHI-sponsored $25 million Congressional aid package to Cyprus was approved.
Other groups under the American Hellenic Institute.
Other groups include:
Major activities (including those taken as part of AHI).
AHI has been a part of many political activities and lobbying actions. Representatives of AHI have testified before Congress with great frequency on topics related to their interests, usually foreign aid proposals for Cyprus, Greece, Albania, Turkey, or the Republic of Macedonia. was integral in the movement to change the 7:10 power-sharing ratio on Cyprus to 1:1, which they perceived as more equitable. AHI both opposed American support of the 2004 Annan Plan for unification of Cyprus, calling the plan "undemocratic" and "unworkable." Each presidential election year, a policy statement is sent to the candidates by AHI and its affiliates informing them of issues of interest to the Greek-American community. In September 2008, the American Hellenic Institute contacted all members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asking them to submit questions about American policy toward Cyprus to the new US Ambassador to Turkey, James F. Jeffrey. AHI has sponsored legislative conferences, notably in 1997, when three one-day Legislative Policy Conferences were held in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago to highlight contributions by grassroots activists in the Greek-American community and to coordinate stances among Greek-American groups.
Major Issues of Concern.
The issues outlined in the AHI policy letters sent to presidential candidates Obama and McCain were typical of policy points that AHI advocates. First and foremost was the question of American policy on Cyprus. The removal of all Turkish troops and the peaceful unification of the island feature prominently as goals in most Greek-American lobbying. In the event of continued Turkish military presence on Cyprus, AHI advised the application of economic sanctions and an arms embargo against Turkey because of restriction of human rights and lack of cooperation with American aims. The letter also called for reinforcement of maritime borders and airspace in the Aegean, which Turkey has purportedly repeatedly violated. AHI also urges the Republic of Macedonia to negotiate in good faith with Greece to resolve the name issue and find a mutually-acceptable solution to the name to be used by the Republic of Macedonia for all purposes. AHI maintains that the Republic of Macedonia should immediately cease their propaganda against Greece, propaganda which violates the U.N.-brokered Interim Accord between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece, as stated in Article 7 paragraph 1 of the Accord which was signed in New York, September 13, 1995. Since antiquity the name Macedonia has referred to a geographical region and not to a nationality. Geographic Macedonia is within the borders of at least three countries. Only a small portion of geographic Macedonia lies within the Republic of Macedonia, whose population is one-third Albanian and two-thirds Slavic in origin, yet the government of the Republic of Macedonia continues to make territorial claims on parts of Greece (the largest part of geographic Macedonia lies within Greece in the Greek province of Macedonia). Finally, the policy letters strongly suggested the inclusion of Greece in the American visa waiver program and the application of American pressure to ensure protection of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and Greek Orthodox theological centers in Turkey.
Changes in Level of Influence.
AHI reached its peak of power in the late 1970s, due to the urgency of the situation on Cyprus at the time, in accordance with the theory of functionalism. Additional factors in AHI's high levels of influence at the time include the demise of the divisive Greek junta, a "new wave" of Greek immigration to the US, and the placement of many Greek-Americans in high levels in American politics and business. The organization did, however, face considerable opposition from the executive branch of government, notably as represented in the person of Henry Kissinger. By the 1980s and after, AHI had declined somewhat in influence, although, as mentioned earlier, they continued to be active in the political arena. Their relative decline can be attributed to a variety of factors, among them the fact that the Greek-American community had more issues by then to collectively tackle than that of the Cyprus conflict.

Pigeon toe

Pigeon toe (also known as metatarsus varus, metatarsus adductus, in-toe gait, intoeing or false clubfoot) is a condition which causes the toes to point inward when walking. It is most common in infants and children under two years of age and, when not the result of simple muscle weakness, normally arises from one of three underlying conditions, a twisted shin bone, an excessive anteversion (femoral head is more than 15° from the angle of torsion) resulting in the twisting of the thigh bone when the front part of a person's foot is turned in. 
Severe cases are considered a form of clubfoot.
Causes.
The cause of in-toeing can be differentiated based on the location of the disalignment. The variants are:
Metatarsus Adductus.
The most common form of being pigeon toed, when the feet bend inward from the middle part of the foot to the toes.
Tibial Torsion.
The tibia or lower leg slightly or severely twists inward when walking.
Femoral Anteversion.
The femur or thigh bone turns inward when walking.
Treatment.
Most of these conditions are self-correcting during childhood. In the worst cases surgery may be needed. Most of the time this involves lengthening the achilles tendon. Less severe treatment options for pigeon toe include keeping a child from crossing his or her legs, use of corrective shoes and casting of the foot and lower legs, which is normally done before the child reaches 12 months of age or older.
If the pigeon toe is mild and close to the center, treatment may not be necessary. 
Ballet has been used as a treatment for mild cases. Dance exercises can help to bend the legs outward.

Queen Triggerfish

The queen triggerfish ("Balistes vetula") is a reef dwelling triggerfish of the Atlantic Ocean. It is occasionally caught as a gamefish, and sometimes kept in marine aquaria.
Appearance.
The queen triggerfish reaches , though most only are about half that length. It is typically blue, purple, turquoise and green with a yellowish throat, and light blue lines on the fins and head. It can change colour somewhat to match its surroundings, or if subjected to stress.
Ecology and range.
The queen triggerfish is typically found at coral and rocky reefs in depths of , but it can occur as deep as and sometimes over areas with sand or seagrass. 
In the West Atlantic, it ranges from Canada to southern Brazil, and in the East Atlantic it is found at Ascension, Cape Verde, Azores and south to Angola. It is reasonably common in Florida, the Bahamas and the Caribbean.
It preys on a variety of invertebrates, notably sea urchins.
In the aquarium.
As one of the largest and most aggressive of the triggerfish, this fish is rarely a good choice as a resident in a marine aquarium. It is however a hardy fish for those who can provide it with a proper environment. Because it grows so large and so quickly the ideal aquarium for this fish is a 500 gallon aquarium. Although some sources argue it can be kept in as little a tank as 125 gallons, when it achieves its adult size of two feet it is unlikely to thrive.
Its diet consists of invertebrates. In aquariums shrimp, squid, clams, octopus, scallops, and crab are all good choices of food.
Cuba.
This fish is called "cochino" in Cuba, and this is the probable origin of the name "Bahía de Cochinos", which is known as the Bay of Pigs in English.

Malayalam – Island of Mysteries

Malayalam – Island of Mysteries is a puzzle adventure video game developed by MJK Games in 2007-2008, and released as freeware for PC/Windows on November 10, 2008. The game is a vague crossover between a Robinson Crusoe-themed survival game and a mysterious adventure similar to the Lost (TV series), presented in a cartoonesque style with hand-drawn graphics and animation.
Concept.
The player controls a character named Thomas Paine, a 34-year old fisherman, who has shipwrecked somewhere in the Eastern Indian Ocean. He drifts onto an unknown desert island named Malayalam, where the adventure takes place. The initial goal for the player is to stay alive and secure sufficient living conditions to enable further progress in the game. This involves finding food, hunting, constructing tools, building shelters, sleeping, and other everyday activities on the island. 
The second goal is about solving quests, which are often some sort of puzzle or riddle presented to the player in form of pergaments and bottle posts. In these, the player needs to seek solutions using objects or information he has discovered on the island. The ultimate goal is to solve all missions on the island, and find a way off.
The game awards Malayalam Points for each day survived and for each quest solved. Players can compete with each other in an online high score table, which ranks every contender by the number of Malayalam Points earned. Other than that, Malayalam – Island of Mysteries is purely a single-player game.
Gameplay.
Most of the gameplay is about exploration of unknown areas. In order to either survive or solve quests, the player needs to wander around the island and explore different regions. The scale of exploration is dependent on how the player decides to play the game; if he concentrates on survival and everyday living, a smaller playing area and less exploration is required. But when the goal is to solve as many quests as possible and reach the ultimate goal of finding a way off the island, dozens of different regions need to be investigated.
The player moves around the island by walking from one region to another, or teleporting over multiple regions at once by using a teleport. Quests are read by walking over a pergament or a bottle post. It's up to the player to decide which quests to accept and when, so the gameplay is relatively dynamic in this regard. Three quests can be accepted and worked on simultaneously. When quests are completed, Malayalam Points and sometimes additional reward objects are given to the player.
The Island.
The island of Malayalam is roughly 3 km square in real size and 50,000 x 50,000 pixels on the computer screen, and comprises roughly 120 unique regions. There are basically five main types of terrain on the island: jungle, forest, desert, savannah and "mud". Each has its own set of notes, pergaments, bottle posts, buildings, objects and animals. The player can freely explore any of them at any given time, but it's more effective to start from the middle of the island and proceed outward later on.
The game begins at the center of the island in a region called Kozhencherry. This region features four quests; 'First Meal', 'Shelter', 'Jane's Message' and 'The Menhir Whispers'. Kozhencherry also has the first two buildings in the game: Hatch #1 in a small southwestern island, and Cabin #2 in the North. Together with several of its neighbouring regions, Kozhencherry provides the player with sufficient objects to construct some essential tools and assets for himself, including a rod, an axe, a shelter, a cannon and a slingshot.
Quests & Notes.
The game contains almost 200 quests and missions spread over the island. Each region has 1-4 quests, which can be either normal or time-limited. In time-limited quests, the player needs to solve the task inside the given time, measured in game's own time system and not in real time. Three missions can be worked on simultaneously but only one of these can be a time-limited mission. Quests can be roughly divided in the following groups:
Find certain objects based on clues
Find certain locations based on clues
Solve a riddle or a task by entering the correct answer in a building
Decrypt a secret code
Sacrifice an animal
Perform an activity using tools
Collect, combine and utilize information
Other
The difficulty level of the quests varies greatly. The first quest, 'First Meal', is representative of the easiest tasks on the island, in which the player just needs to kill a crab, one of game's harmless animals, and eat it. By contrast, some of the harder missions are multiphased problem solving puzzles, where the player needs to spend a lot of time and effort. Each quest has a score weight of 1-10, meaning that the basic score for solving a task (100 Malayalam Points) will be multiplied by this weight. Usually, the easier quests reward the player with only 100 or 200 MP's whereas the harder ones award 500 MP's or more.
Objects.
The game has dozens of objects that the player can interact with. Each of them can be picked up, added to the inventory and carried around. Some can be combined with other objects, and food items, naturally, are edible.
Here are two examples of how important objects form a chain of activities in the game:
- Log + axe head = axe -> chop more logs + match = fireplace + food = roasted food
- Branch + line = rod + lure = more efficient rod = bigger fish
Shelter is one of the most important assets in the game. It can be constructed from logs and palm leaves anywhere on land where there are no obstacles in the way.
Shelter has multiple advantages: sleeping is faster and the player doesn't catch a flu, unlike sleeping outside. Especially on cold nights, in can be very crucial to have a shelter in which to spend the night (unless there are lots of health pack objects in use that make it possible to take risks with health). Shelter provides safety from many predators and harmful animals like lions, scorpions and snakes. Every food item gives double nutritional values when it's eaten inside the shelter. Food items can also be stored for future use, and they won't vanish, as they do outside the shelter, if placed inside the shelter area. One of shelter's biggest benefits is its healing effect; by spending time in a shelter, the player will regain his health without having to consume health packs. Finally, shelter allows some specific actions to be taken, such as reading a newspaper, which can provide important new knowledge about the island.
Food & Nutrition System.
There are 42 food items available in total, which are divided into five nutrition groups: fish, protein, fruit, meat and iron. Fish is the largest group consisting of 20 different fish species, like sardines (small, under 1 kg in weight), salmon (medium, 3–8 kg in weight) and giant gourami (from 25 to even over 100 kg in weight). The player can improve his fishing skills by finding ability objects.
Protein, as the second nutrition group, is gained from eating smaller animals like crabs and turtles. Fruits on the island include bananas, coconuts and oranges. The first two can be shaken from some palm trees, and the latter from some orange trees. Meat is obtained mainly from birds, but also from bigger predators like lions. Iron, the fifth group, includes 11 different mushroom species, of which some eight are edible. Mushrooms are easy to get from the regions where they're available, but many regions, such as the Great Desert, don't have any mushrooms.
The player always has certain nutritional requirements. These can be viewed via the ”Functions” tab's ”Nutrition” button. Nutritional requirements are specific for each nutritional group. For example, if the player has a high requirement for fish, then it's beneficial to start fishing and eat some fish to satisfy the hunger. Of course, the player may eat food items from some other nutrition groups as well, but it can take more time and effort to satisfy the same hunger than with fish. But when the player eats many fish in a row, their nutritional requirement will lower accordingly. 
This, in turn, will make other food items relatively more appetizing. In order to survive efficiently, so that time will be left for other activities such as quest solving, it is necessary for the player to monitor nutritional requirements and utilize multiple sources of food throughout the game. Moreover, if many of the nutritional requirements will stay on a high level, this will increase food consumption, so in some cases, even though your nutrition is at maximum, it might be beneficial to still eat to lower the requirements.
Solving The Game.
It is possible to beat the game and get off the island. This is the ultimate goal for the player, but it depends on a very complex set of actions and dozens of hours of gameplay. The player first needs to solve the most, but not all, of the quests on the island to activate certain equipment. This equipment must be used to free the island of its "tyrant of centuries", as the game describes the process. Once the island is free, the last chain of tasks is accessible. A quest called "Last Question" appears. Once it is answered correctly, someone will want to meet the player's character. When in the correct place, something will appear after a moment of waiting, and that something enables the player to get off the island.
Up to date, only one player is known to have completed the game and escaped the island.

The Kendriya Vidyalayas have a fourfold mission:
Features.
There is a common syllabus and bilingual instruction in all schools. They are all co-educational. Sanskrit was taught as a compulsory subject from classes VI to VIII and as an optional subject until class XII, and these days students can elect French, German or the regional language of the resident Indian state. BBC micro computers were introduced as part of the scheme by the government. The quality of teaching is kept reasonably high by an appropriate teacher-pupil ratio. There are no tuition fees for boys up to class VIII, girls up to class XII and SC/ST students and children of KVS employees. 
In a bid to showcase its impressive results in national-level examinations, the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has started seeking a quality accreditation for its schools. Recently,the school had tied up with Oracle to start the Thinkquest initiative which is website that allows students from specific schools all over the world to interact with each other, share ideas and also develop projects.

Metropolitan Television Alliance

The Metropolitan Television Alliance, LLC (MTVA) was organized in the wake of the loss of the transmission facilities atop the World Trade Center in 2001. Its mission is to identify, design and build a facility suitable for the long term requirements of its member stations to meet their over-the-air digital broadcast requirements. This could include designing facilities for the Freedom Tower in Lower Manhattan, assessing alternative sites and technologies and dealing with local, state and federal authorities on relevant issues.
The group, which includes stations WABC-TV 7, WCBS-TV 2, WFUT–TV 68, WNBC–TV 4, WNET–TV 13, WNJU–TV 47, WNYE-TV 25, WNYW–TV 5, WPIX–TV 11, WPXN-TV 31, WWOR-TV 9 and WXTV–TV 41, signed a memorandum of understanding in 2003 with the developer, Larry A. Silverstein, to install antennas atop the Freedom Tower. Broadcasters have used the Empire State Building (and, to a lesser degree, 4 Times Square) since the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001. In 2006, control of the project was transferred to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, with which further discussions have been ongoing. 
The group received a grant from the NTIA to study distributed transmission system (DTS) in New York City. Multiple tests were run from various sites in the New York and Newark region in 2006 and 2007 by MTVA and individual member stations, with the use of distributed transmission on a permanent, non-experimental basis ultimately approved for US stations by the Federal Communications Commission on November 7, 2008.
In 2008, Saul Shapiro was appointed President.

Contrahens

The contrahentes (singular contrahens) are muscles widely present in the hands of mammals, including monkeys. They are on the palmar/plantar side. There is one each for digits I II IV V but not III. They pull the fingers/toes down and together.
Human anatomy.
In humans, the adductor pollicis muscle (and the adductor hallucis in the foot) is a well-developed remnant of the first contrahens though it has lost the insertion on the distal phalanx of the thumb.
The other contrahentes only appear as rare atavistic abnormalities.
In other mammals, the contrahentes may have their origin either on the carpus or the metacarpus, which suggests that the palmar interossei muscles also contain elements of the contrahentes.
They appear in the human fetus as a layer of flesh which mostly disappears.
In other animals.
The contrahentes of the fourth digit is absent in dogs but present in cats and rabbits.
In primates, the contrahentes vary in number between zero and four. By their insertion onto the proximal phalanges they facilitate convergence of the digits.
In tarsiers, they facilitate the grip by increasing the pressure between the large distal pads and the gripped surface by simultaneously flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints and the proximal interphalangeal joints and extending the distal interphalangeal joints.

Hans Victor von Unruh

Hans Victor von Unruh ( March 28, 1806 - February 4, 1886) was a Prussian civil servant and politician, President of the Prussian National Assembly of 1848 and Member of the "Reichstag" of the German Empire.
Biography.
Unruh was born in Tilsit, East Prussia to Majorgeneral Friedrich-Wilhelm von Unruh (1766–1835) and Karoline, née Freiin von Buttlar (1776–1858). He visited school in Königsberg and studied at Karl Friedrich Schinkel's Bauakademie Berlin, where he passed his exam in 1834. On September 14, 1828 Unruh married Ernestine von Risselmann, née von Knobloch (1802–1869) in Breslau, but was divorced soon after. In 1834 he married Marie Clement (1816–1849) in Frankfurt (Oder). Unruh started to work as an hydraulic engineer in Breslau and became a governmental engineer in Gumbinnen in 1839 and after an apply for transfer in Potsdam in 1843. In 1844 he took a voluntary leave of absence and became the head of the railroad construction Magdeburg-Potsdam and a member of the board of Directors of the Magdeburg-Wittenberg Railway Company, himself moving to Magdeburg with his family.
Unruh made several foreign study trips with August Borsig.
After the Revolution of 1848 Unruh was elected as Magdeburg's Member of the Prussian constitutional convention as a modest Liberal. He joined the left centre, later the right centre parliamentary group.
On October 17, 1848 Unruh was elected as the Deputy President, on October 28, 1848 President of the constitutional convention, a position he kept until the convention was dissolved in 1852. 
In January 1849 Unruh became the delegate of Magdeburg at the Second Chamber of the Prussian Landtag, which was dissolved in April 1849 after its opposition against the Prussian three-class franchise. As a result of Unruh's position King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia declined his appointment even though the Magdeburg town councillors had elected him as First Mayor.
In 1855 Unruh moved to Anhalt, at that time another component state of Germany, where he founded the Deutsche Continental Gasgesellschaft in Dessau and was responsible for the construction of the municipal gasworks at Mönchengladbach, Magdeburg und Lviv and the water supply works at Magdeburg.
Unruh was a Co-founder of the German National Association in 1859 and the liberal Deutsche Fortschrittspartei in 1861, becoming its first President until 1863. In 1863 he was reelected as a member of the Prussian Parliament. The Fortschrittspartei was split after a conflict on the support of Otto von Bismarck and Unruh founded the National Liberal Party jointly with Rudolf von Bennigsen in 1867. 
Unruh was a member of the Parliament of the North German Confederation in 1867 and the Reichstag until 1879. On April 9, 1874, as a vice-president of the Reichstag, he implemented the "Hammelsprung" (lit: mutton skip), a special kind of division, still used in the modern German Bundestag. 
Unruh died on February 4, 1886 in Dessau.

Komar-class missile boat

The Soviet Project 183R class, more commonly known as "Komar" (meaning "mosquito"), is a class of missile boats, the first of its kind, built in the 1950s and 1960s. Notably, they were the first to sink another ship with anti-ship missiles in 1967.
Design.
The Project 183 MTB was designed just after World War II. These boats were armed with two 533 mm torpedo tubes and were used extensively by Soviet coastal forces in the 1950s. The torpedo boat had a wooden semi-planing hull and was fitted with radar. Over 622 MTBs were built. A sub-chaser variant fitted with sonar and depth charges was also built as was a radio controlled target boat.
In 1956, the P-15 Termit missile became available (NATO reporting name: SS-N-2 "Styx"). The Project 183 proved to be a natural choice for mounting the new missiles, giving the small, fast boats great firepower for their size. The new combination was designated Project 183R, the first missile boat in service anywhere in the world. The missiles could be fired in sea state 4.
A total of 112 Komars were built between 1956 and 1965 and served in the Soviet Navy, along with several allied navies, until the 1980s, when they were replaced by newer, more capable fast attack craft.

Extriplex joaquinana

Extriplex joaquinana is a species known by the common name San Joaquin saltbush. It was formerly included in genus "Atriplex".
Distribution.
It is endemic to California, where it grows in alkaline soils in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and adjacent parts of the Central Valley and eastern Central Coast Ranges.
Description.
This is an annual herb growing erect to a maximum height near one meter. The leaves are 1 to 7 centimeters in length, often scaly, green to gray-green in color, and oval to triangular in shape. The leaves are mostly located lower on the erect plant; those further up the stem are reduced in size. The inflorescences of male flowers are dense, heavy spikes, and the female flowers are held in smaller clusters.
Systematics.
The first publication of this taxon was in 1904 by Aven Nelson as "Atriplex joaquinana" A.Nelson (in: "Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington" 17(12): 99). (It has sometimes been wrongly spelled "Atriplex joaquiniana"). In 2010, after phylogenetic research, Elizabeth H. Zacharias classified it in a new genus "Extriplex", as "Extriplex joaquinana" (A.Nelson) E.H.Zacharias.
"Extriplex joaquinana" belongs to the tribe Atripliceae in the Chenopodioideae subfamily of Amaranthaceae.

Sail switch

A sail switch, vane switch or flow switch is a mechanical switch that is switched on or off in response to the flow or non-flow of a fluid such as air or water. A sail switch typically operates through the use of a paddle which gets displaced due to the force of fluid moving past it. Sail switches find application in the detection of fluid flow and measurement of fan speeds. A sail switch might be used to protect a central heating system electric heating element from being energized before the air flow from the blower is established. Sail switches might also be used to alarm if a ventilation fan in a hazardous location fails and air flow has stopped.

Seven people were aboard, two Germans (pilot and co-pilot from XL Airways) and five New Zealanders (one pilot, three aircraft engineers and one member of the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand). Two bodies were recovered within hours of the crash; the others were found during later weeks.
The extent of shattering of the wreckage indicated that the crash occurred at high speed.
The crash area was declared a crime scene and the French justice system opened a manslaughter investigation.
The aircraft had been overhauled by a local French company located at the Perpignan–Rivesaltes Airport prior to its return off lease.
Investigation.
On 30 November 2008, divers recovered the second "black box" flight recorder and a third body, unidentified at the time. Although the cockpit voice recorder was damaged, experts said that there was a good probability of recovering data from it.
In late December, French investigators attempted to retrieve data from both black boxes, but the data could not be read. Usable data from the flight recorders was later recovered at the manufacturer's facility.
The investigators' interest focused on the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit following recent similar Qantas incidents on A330s, exhibiting sudden uncommanded maneuvering ("see: Qantas Flight 72"). The investigation was led by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), with the participation of its counterparts from the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation (BFU), the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC), and the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Specialists from Airbus and from International Aero Engines (IAE), from XL Airways Germany, operator of the airplane and from Air New Zealand, the owner of the airplane, were associated with the work of the technical investigation.
Analysis of the data led to an interim finding that the crew lost control of the aircraft. While conducting a planned test of low-speed flight at low altitude, the aircraft was descending through 3000 feet on full autopilot for a go-around. Landing gear was just extended when at 15:44:30 UTC the speed dropped from 136 to 99 knots in 35 seconds. The stall warning sounded four times during violent maneuvering to regain control. By 15:46:00 the warning had silenced as the aircraft regained speed in a rapid descent, but six seconds later, at 263 knots, the aircraft had only 340 feet elevation and was 14 degrees nose down. A second later it was in the water.
In September 2010, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile published their final report into the accident. The primary cause was incorrect maintenance procedures which allowed water to enter the angle of attack (AOA) sensors. The water then froze in flight, rendering the sensors inoperative and thus removing the protection they provided from the aircraft's flight management system. When the crew attempted an improvised test of the AOA warning system (which was not functioning due to the blocked sensors) they lost control of the plane. The crew was unaware that the AOA sensors were blocked, but they also disregarded the proper speed limits for the tests they were performing, resulting in a stall. Five safety recommendations were made.
Date coincidence.
The crash was highly publicised in New Zealand due to a date coincidence with another Air New Zealand crash. Due to differing time zones, the crash of Flight 888T occurred in the morning of 28 November New Zealand time - 29 years to the day after Air New Zealand Flight 901 crashed into Mount Erebus in Antarctica, killing all 257 on board.

Wu Yulu

Wu Yulu is a Chinese farmer and inventor of home-made robots. He has become widely known for his fanciful creations made from scrap metal and other materials. He lives in Mawu Village, near Beijing.
Career.
He started making robots at about 11 years of age. With a different upbringing or education perhaps, Wu might have become an engineer. But his teachers were no good when he was school-aged, he said, so he stopped going. He learned to make robots by making mistakes.
In the late 1970s, Wu got a job at a farm machinery factory, and the small income helped him turn used sewing machine parts and some steel wire into his first robot. "Until now, I don't know the theory of physics, but I knew that electricity can drive motors and power can be transferred to the robot's hands and legs with levers and wires," Wu said. After his first robot turned out to be "disabled," Wu continued to experiment. In 1982, the first movable robot, Wu Laoda (the first son of the Wu), was born.
Robots.
Wu's robots' given names indicate the order they are created, and they are all given his own family name (Wu). His most famous robot is named Wu . He has built robots capable of climbing walls, serving water, lighting cigarettes, playing musical instruments and writing calligraphy.
"I can invent robots able to carry a sedan chair, and next I will make robots of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. "There are so many good things in life, and they become the basis for my robots".

IAP statement on population growth

The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth is an international scientist consensus document discussing and demanding a halt of the population expansion. This was the first worldwide joint statement of academies of sciences, and their cooperative InterAcademy Panel on International Issues. It was signed by 58 member academies and hence ratified in 1994.
Background.
Between October 24 and October 27, 1993, an international "scientist's top summit" was held in New Delhi, India, with representatives from academies of sciences from all over the world. This grew out of two previous meetings, one joint meeting by the Royal Society of London and the United States National Academy of Sciences, and one international meeting organised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The scientists discussed the environmental and social welfare problems for the world population, and found them closely linked to the population expansion.
In the year 1950, there were approximately 2.5 billion (2,500 million) humans alive in this world. By 1960, the number had reached 3 billion, and by 1975 was at 4 billion. The 5 billion mark was reached around 1987, and in 1993, at the New Delhi meeting, academics estimated the population to be 5.5 billion. For some time, world food production had been able to roughly match population growth, meaning that starvation was a regional and distributional problem, rather than one based on a total shortage of food. The scientists noted that increased food production on land and on sea in the previous decade was less than the population increase over the same period. Moreover, by increased food production and otherwise, the population growth was contributing to a loss of biodiversity, deforestation and loss of topsoil, and shortages of water and fuel. The academics noted that the complex relationships between population size and various environmental effects were not fully understood, but that "there is no doubt that the threat to the ecosystem is linked to population size and resource use". They were aware of the problems with increasing greenhouse emissions and other environmental threats, and found these linked to the population growth.
The scientists decided to adopt a resolution on the problems and on the means to solve them, and that this resolution should be put to vote by the respective national academies of science. In 1993, they also established the InterAcademy Panel, in order to coordinate this and future similar consensus resolutions on important global issues.
Statement summary.
The academies note that "the world is undergoing an unprecedented population expansion", and that it is necessary to stop it. In fact, we must reach "zero population growth within the lifetime of our children", if we are to achieve the "common goal", which was defined as "the improvement of the quality of life for all, both now and succeeding generations", including "social, economic and personal well-being while preserving fundamental human rights and the ability to live harmoniously in a protected environment".
Moreover, these goals are achievable, but in order to achieve them it is not sufficient to halt the population expansion. At the same time, a number of actions need to be taken, in order to improve health and welfare, and lessen the negative human impact on the environment. Finally, more research in these areas is needed.
The proposed actions are codified in 21 points. Those directly dealing with halting the population growth include furthering equal opportunities for women, easy access to cheap and safe contraceptives, family planning programmes, broad primary health care and education, and increased research on cultural, religious, and other factors, which "affect reproductive behavior". In accordance with the respect for fundamental human rights, the measures do not include any kind of coercion, but enabling and encouragement for choosing to limit the number of children in a family.
Other points include governmental policies recognizing longer-term environmental responsibilities; assistance from the industrialised to the developing world for environmental problems; pricing and taxing that take environmental cost into account, and thus influence consumer behaviour, and transitions to less energy consumptive economies.

Siege of Constantinople (1204)

The Sack of Constantinople or Siege of Constantinople (also called the Fourth Crusade) occurred in 1204; it destroyed parts of the capital of the Byzantine Empire as the city was captured by Western European and Venetian Crusaders. After the capture the Latin Empire was founded and Baldwin of Flanders was crowned Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople in the Hagia Sophia.
Before the Siege.
The Massacre of the Latins (; ), a large-scale massacre of the Roman Catholic or "Latin" inhabitants of Constantinople, by the Eastern Orthodox population of the city in May 1182 had a dramatic effect on the schism between the Western and Eastern Christian churches. The massacre also further worsened the image of the Byzantines in the eyes of the Western powers, and although regular trade agreements were soon resumed between Byzantium and Latin states, the underlying hostility would remain; leaving many westerners seeking some form of revenge.
Following the first siege of Constantinople in 1203, on 1 August 1203, the pro-Crusader Alexios Angelos was crowned Emperor Alexios IV of the Byzantine Empire, who then tried to pacify the city. But riots between anti-Crusader Greeks and pro-Crusader Latins broke out later that month and lasted until November, during which most of the populace began to turn against Emperor Alexios IV.
On 25 January 1204, the death of co-Emperor Isaac II set off rioting in Constantinople in which the people deposed Alexios IV, who turned to the Crusaders for help but was imprisoned by the imperial chamberlain, Alexios Doukas, who declared himself Emperor on 5 February. Emperor Alexios V then attempted to negotiate with the Crusaders for a withdrawal from Byzantine territory, but they refused to abandon their old treaty with Alexios IV. When Alexios V ordered Alexios IV's execution on 8 February, the Crusaders declared war on Alexios V. In March 1204, the Crusader and Venetian leadership decided on the outright conquest of Constantinople, and drew up a formal agreement to divide the Byzantine Empire between them.
Siege.
By the end of March, the combined Crusader armies were besieging Constantinople as Emperor Alexios V began to strengthen the city's defences while conducting more active operations outside the city. By the first week of April, the Crusaders had begun their siege from their encampment in the town of Galata across the Golden Horn from Constantinople.
On 9 April 1204, the Crusader and Venetian forces began an assault on the Golden Horn fortifications by crossing the waterway to the northwest wall of the city, but, because of bad weather, the assault forces were driven back when the troops that landed came under heavy archery fire in open ground between Constantinople's fortifications and the shore.
Capture of the city.
On 12 April 1204, weather conditions finally favoured the Crusaders as the weather cleared and a second assault on the city was ordered. A strong north wind aided the Venetian ships near the Golden Horn to come close to the city wall, which enabled the attackers to seize some of the towers along the wall. After a short battle, approximately 70 crusaders managed to enter the city. Some Crusaders were eventually able to knock holes in the walls, small enough for a few knights at a time to crawl through; the Venetians were also successful at scaling the walls from the sea, although there was extremely bloody fighting with the Varangians. The crusaders captured the Blachernae section of the city in the northwest and used it as a base to attack the rest of the city, but while attempting to defend themselves with a wall of fire they ended up burning down even more of the city. This second fire left 15,000 people homeless. Emperor Alexios V fled from the city that night through the Polyandriou (Rhegium) Gate and escaped into the countryside west of the city.
Sack of Constantinople.
The Crusaders looted, terrorized and vandalized Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient and medieval Roman and Greek works were either stolen or destroyed. The famous bronze horses from the Hippodrome were sent back to adorn the facade of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, wherein they still remain. As well as being stolen, works of immeasurable value were destroyed merely for their material value. One of the most precious works to suffer such a fate was a large bronze statue of Hercules, created by the legendary Lysippos, court sculptor of no lesser than Alexander the Great. Like so many other priceless artworks made of bronze, the statue was melted down for its content by the Crusaders whose greed blinded them.
The Library of Constantinople was destroyed. Despite their oaths and the threat of excommunication, the Crusaders systematically violated the city's holy sanctuaries, destroying or stealing all they could lay hands on: nothing was spared. The civilian population of Constantinople were subject to the Crusaders' ruthless lust for spoils and glory: thousands of them were killed in cold blood. Women, even nuns, were raped by the Crusader army, which also sacked churches, monasteries and convents. The very altars of these churches were smashed and torn to pieces for their gold and marble by the warriors who had sworn to fight in service of Christendom without question. Although the Venetians engaged in looting too, their actions were by far more restrained. Doge Dandolo still appeared to have far more control over his men. Rather than wantonly destroying all around like their comrades, the Venetians stole religious relics and works of art which they would later take to Venice to adorn their own churches with.
It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks. The Venetians received 150,000 silver marks that was their due, while the Crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the Crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many Crusader knights. Latin residents of Constantinople, meanwhile, in their own ways exacted retribution for the Massacre of the Latins of 1182.
Aftermath.
According to a prearranged treaty, the empire was apportioned between Venice and the crusade's leaders, and the Latin Empire of Constantinople was established. Boniface was not elected as the new emperor, although the citizens seemed to consider him as such; the Venetians thought he had too many connections with the former empire because of his brother, Renier of Montferrat, who had been married to Maria Comnena, empress in the 1170s and 80s. Instead they placed Baldwin of Flanders on the throne. He was crowned Emperor in the Hagia Sophia as Baldwin I of Constantinople. Boniface went on to found the Kingdom of Thessalonica, a vassal state of the new Latin Empire. The Venetians also founded the Duchy of the Archipelago in the Aegean Sea.
Most of the Byzantine aristocracy fled the city. Amongst the ordinary people of the former empire, there was no sympathy for the Byzantine elite, who were seen as having ruled the empire increasingly badly. The contemporary Byzantine historian and eye-witness, Nicetas Choniates closed his account of the fall of the city with the following description of a column of aristocratic refugees, including the Patriarch, making their way to Selymbria: 
Byzantine aristocratic refugees founded their own successor states, the most notable of these being the Empire of Nicaea under Theodore Lascaris (a relative of Alexius III), the Empire of Trebizond, and the Despotate of Epirus.
The sack weakened the Byzantine Empire, which allowed neighboring groups like the Sultanate of Rum, and later the Ottoman Turks, to gain influence (see the Byzantine–Ottoman Wars).
Legacy.
Eight hundred years after the Fourth Crusade, Pope John Paul II twice expressed sorrow for the events of the Fourth Crusade. In 2001, he wrote to Christodoulos, Archbishop of Athens, saying, "It is tragic that the assailants, who set out to secure free access for Christians to the Holy Land, turned against their brothers in the faith. The fact that they were Latin Christians fills Catholics with deep regret." In 2004, while Bartholomew I, Patriarch of Constantinople, was visiting the Vatican, John Paul II asked, "How can we not share, at a distance of eight centuries, the pain and disgust." This has been regarded as an apology to the Greek Orthodox Church for the slaughter perpetrated by the warriors of the Fourth Crusade.
In April 2004, in a speech on the 800th anniversary of the city's capture, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I formally accepted the apology. "The spirit of reconciliation is stronger than hatred," he said during a liturgy attended by Roman Catholic Archbishop Philippe Barbarin of Lyon, France. "We receive with gratitude and respect your cordial gesture for the tragic events of the Fourth Crusade. It is a fact that a crime was committed here in the city 800 years ago." Bartholomew said his acceptance came in the spirit of Pascha. "The spirit of reconciliation of the resurrection... incites us toward reconciliation of our churches."

Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg

The Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg (Museum of Fine Arts of Strasbourg) is the old masters paintings collection of the city of Strasbourg, located in the Alsace region of France. The museum is housed in the first and second floors of the baroque Palais Rohan since 1898. The museum displays works by non-Upper Rhenish artists from between the 14th century and 1871 and by Upper Rhenish artist from between 1681 and 1871. The museum owns circa 865 works (as of 2009), of which 250 are on permanent display. The old masters from the upper-Rhenish area until 1681 are exhibited in the neighboring Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame.
Historical overview.
The first municipal art collection of the city of Strasbourg was the result of the French Revolution, and was a consequence of the expropriation of churches and cloisters. Through the years, the collection, which was founded in 1801, grew by private donations, as well as government loans from the inventory of the Louvre. On August 24, 1870, the museum, which was housed in the "Aubette" on Place Kléber, was set on fire by Prussian artillery fire and completely destroyed. After the end of the Franco-Prussian War, it was resolved to re-establish the museum, and the imperial art historian Wilhelm von Bode was commissioned with the task in 1889. In 1890, the museum was launched and was re-stocked since that time by acquisitions and gifts. In 1931 under the leadership of Hans Haug (1890–1965), the collection of medieval art and upper-Rhenish painting (Konrad Witz, Hans Baldung, Sebastian Stoskopff) was transferred to the newly founded Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame. The collection of modern art went to the Musée d’Art Moderne et Contemporain de Strasbourg (Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Strasbourg).
On August 13, 1947, fire destroyed part of the re-established collection, including works of Francesco Guardi, Thomas de Keyser, Antonio del Pollaiolo and Lucas Cranach the Elder. However with the money from the insurance, it was possible to acquire other artistically valuable paintings. The collection of the museum is also regularly being expanded by donations, notably in 1987 and 1994 by collectors Othon Kaufman and François Schlageter (Italian paintings), in 2004 by collectors Roger and Elisabeth Eisenbeth (Dutch paintings) and in 2009 by the collector Ann L. Oppenheimer (Italian, Flemish and Dutch paintings).

Siege of Constantinople (1203)

The Siege of Constantinople in 1203 was a Crusader siege of the capital of the Byzantine Empire, in support of the deposed emperor Isaac II Angelos and his son Alexios IV Angelos. It marked the main outcome of the Fourth Crusade. 
The siege.
To take the city by force, the Crusaders first needed to cross the Bosphorus. About 200 ships, horse transports and galleys would undertake to deliver the crusading army across the narrow strait, where Alexius III had lined up the Byzantine army in battle formation along the shore, north of the suburb of Galata. The Crusaders' knights charged straight out of the horse transports, and the Byzantine army fled south. 
The Crusaders followed south, and attacked the Tower of Galata, which held one end of the chain that blocked access to the Golden Horn. As they laid siege to the Tower, the Greeks counterattacked with some initial success. However, when the Crusaders rallied and the Greeks retreated to the Tower, the Crusaders were able to follow the soldiers through the Gate, and the Tower surrendered. The Golden Horn now lay open to the Crusaders, and the Venetian fleet entered. 
On July 11, the Crusaders took positions opposite the Blachernae palace on the northwest corner of the city. Alexios IV was paraded outside the walls, but the citizens were apathetic, as Alexios III, though a usurper and illegitimate in the eyes of the westerners, was an acceptable emperor for the Byzantine citizens. The siege began in earnest on July 17, with four divisions attacking the land walls, while the Venetian fleet attacked the sea walls from the Golden Horn. The Venetians took a section of the wall of about 25 towers, while the Varangian guard held off the Crusaders on the land wall. The Varangians shifted to meet the new threat, and the Venetians retreated under the screen of fire. The fire lasted for 3 days and destroyed about of the city, leaving 20,000 people homeless.
Alexius III finally took offensive action, and led 17 divisions from the St. Romanus Gate, vastly outnumbering the Crusaders. Alexius III's army of about 8,500 men faced the Crusader's 7 divisions (about 3,500 men), but his courage failed, and the Byzantine army returned to the city without a fight.
On July 18, 1203 the Crusaders launched an assault on the city, and Alexios III immediately fled into Thrace. The next morning, the Crusaders were surprised to find that the citizens had released Isaac II from prison and proclaimed him emperor, despite the fact that he had been blinded to make him ineligible to rule. The Crusaders forced Isaac II to proclaim his son Alexios IV co-emperor on August 1, effectively ending the siege.
After the 1203 siege.
Following the end of the first siege of Constantinople in 1203, on 1 August 1203, the pro-Crusader Alexios Angelos was crowned Emperor Alexios IV of the Byzantine Empire, who then tried to stabilize the city. But riots between anti-Crusader Greeks and pro-Crusader Latins broke out later that month and lasted until November, during which most of the populace began to turn against Emperor Alexios IV.
On 25 January 1204, the death of co-Emperor Isaac II set off rioting in Constantinople in which the people deposed Alexios IV, who turned to the Crusaders for help but was imprisoned by the imperial chamberlain, Alexios Doukas, who declared himself Emperor Alexios V on 5 February. Emperor Alexios V then attempted to negotiate with the Crusaders for a withdrawal from Byzantine territory, but they refused to abandon their old treaty with Alexios IV. When Alexios V ordered Alexios IV's execution on 8 February, the Crusaders declared war on Alexios V. In March 1204, the Crusader and Venetian leadership decided on the outright conquest of Constantinople, and drew up a formal agreement to divide the Byzantine Empire between them. By the end of that month, the combined Crusader armies had begun the Siege of Constantinople (1204) as Emperor Alexios V began to strengthen the city's defences while conducting more active operations outside the city.

Osmia rufa

Osmia rufa or Osmia bicornis is a species of mason bee, and is known as the red mason bee due to its covering of dense gingery hair.
The species is most active during the spring and early summer although it can be seen as far as late June. Despite being classed as solitary, these bees can be seen gathering, or aggregating. The female is larger/broader than the male and has two large horns on the head. The male has a white tuft of hair on its face. The female has a much smaller sting than honeybees or wasps.
"Osmia rufa" nest in preexisting hollows, choosing not to excavate their own, and have been known to nest in key holes, empty snail shells, plant stems and empty beetle hollows. Male larvae are placed in front of the females within the nest allowing the males to emerge first in the spring. These bees store mostly pollen moistened with a small amount of nectar which is eaten by the larvae during the summer before they rest through the winter in a cocoon. The female will create six to eight cells in four to five different nests in her short life.
Red mason bees are excellent pollinators, particularly of apple trees.
These bees are not aggressive and will only sting if handled very roughly between the fingers and they are safe to be closely observed by children.
Distribution.
"Osmia rufa" is found in England, southern Scotland (possibly northern Scotland as well), Wales, mainland Europe, Sweden, Norway, North Africa, Georgia, Turkey and Iran.

Edith Kent

Edith Kent (born 24 November 1908) was an electrical welder from Plymouth, England during the Second World War. She is notable for being the first woman in Great Britain to be given equal pay.
History.
Kent took a job as a welder at Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth in 1941, where she was paid £5 6s a week. She became the first woman to be employed at the dockyard. Kent has the advantage of being only 4 feet 11 inches tall, meaning that she was small enough to weld in places her male colleagues could not such as torpedo tubes.
In 1942, she gave birth to her only child, a daughter called Jean. She returned to work soon after she gave birth, however, leaving Jean in the care of one of her sisters. In 1943, she was given a pay rise, earning £6 6s. This was higher wage than the average for a male manual worker, which was £5 8s 6d. After the war had finished in 1945, she left her job when the male workforce returned from the front. She took up a new job as a barmaid. She lived with her husband Bill, who ran a shoe repair business. He died in 1996, aged 86.
Kent herself has said that she was embarrassed at the time of her achievement saying: "I got the job because my brothers worked at the dockyard and they thought I would be good at it. I was the first woman to work as a welder there. It made me a bit uncomfortable that I was the first woman to earn the same as the men - and in some cases I was earning more than them. All the men I worked with were marvellous and they didn't seem to mind me earning the same. None of them ever dared say it, but I think they knew I was worth as much as them, if not more."
Kent had an elder sister, Minna Algate, who died aged 106.

Atriplex lentiformis

Atriplex lentiformis (Quail bush, big saltbrush, big saltbush, quailbrush, lenscale, len-scale saltbush and white thistle) is a species of saltbush.
Distribution.
"Atriplex lentiformis" is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it grows in habitats with saline or alkaline soils, such as salt flats and dry lake beds, coastline, and desert scrub. It can also be found in nonsaline soils on riverbanks and woodland.
Description.
"Atriplex lentiformis" is a spreading, communal shrub reaching one to three meters in height and generally more in width. It is highly branched and bears scaly or scurfy gray-green leaves up to 5 centimeters long and often toothed or rippled along the edges. This species may be dioecious or monoecious, with individuals bearing either male or female flowers, or sometimes both. Male flowers are borne in narrow inflorescences up to 50 centimeters long, while inflorescences of female flowers are smaller and more compact. Plants can change from monoecious to dioecious and from male to female and vice versa.
Uses.
This saltbush species, "A. lentiformis", and "Atriplex canescens" are the food plants for the saltbush sootywing "Hesperopsis alpheus", a butterfly. 
"Atriplex lentiformis" is used in restoration of riparian habitats, one of the native plants in riparian zone restoration projects in its native ranges.
Lower Gila River and Colorado River regions.
"Atriplex lentiformis" grows in the Mesquite Bosque vegetative association with the native Arrowweed - "Pluchea sericea", Velvet mesquite - "Prosopis velutina", and others in the Lower Colorado River Valley and Gila River valleys of southwestern Arizona, southeastern California, and northwestern Mexico. 
The maximum height occurs where a groundwater source supplies plentiful moisture, and saline soil conditions are optimal for the quailbush with other plants losing from the competition. However, the invasive species Tamarisk - "Tamarix ramosissima" and tumbleweed, Tumbling oracle - "Atriplex rosea" are successful and problematic competitors. The "Saltbush" can reach tall and wide in advantageous growing locales, with the form becoming a large flattened hemisphere, with adjacent hemispheres merging into an impenetrable thicket mass.

Hipólito Lázaro

Hipólito (or Hipòlit) Lázaro (Barcelona, Spain, September 13, 1887 – May 14, 1974) was a Spanish/Catalan opera singer. Lázaro was born in Barcelona, Spain.
His professional debut was in 1910 at Teatre Novedades in Barcelona, in "La favorite". His Italian debut came late 1910 in "Rigoletto" at the Teatro Tosi-Borghi in Ferrara. During the summer of 1911 he appeared in a series of concerts held in England as Antonio Manuele.
Lázaro created the tenor roles of Mascagni's "Parisina" (1913, Scala) and "Il piccolo Marat" (1921, Costanzi), and Romani's "Fedra" (1915, Costanzi). While in Philadelphia in 1924, he received a letter from Umberto Giordano who was working on his next opera, "La cena delle beffe", asking him to create the tenor role. The premiere was held in December 1924 at La Scala with Lázaro, under the baton of Toscanini. His career was based on verismo roles, Verdi (specially "Rigoletto", "Aida", "Il trovatore"), "Carmen", some bel canto roles ("La favorite", "I puritani", "Les huguenots") and Spanish zarzuela (Arrieta's "Marina", specially).
He had a "wide-ranging, timbred, considerably vibrant, extended, bold, resilient even if slightly guttural voice" (Paolo Padovan) with a brilliant metallic shine, and a passionate approach to singing. When he sang at the Metropolitan Opera House he was overshadowed by Caruso to whom he was compared. He also maintained a strong rivalry with Miguel Fleta.
The second part of Lázaros career, stretching from the mid 20's to his retirement in 1950 (actually, he retired in 1940, with some performances after), consisted of concerts and performances held within Spain, France (Paris) and Italy, apart from his various trips to South America (he was very popular there) and in particular Cuba.
His repertoire was becoming narrower and narrower from the 30's and onwards, and the voice showed clear signs of decline. Yet he conserved some of his glory and acclaim through the zarzuela. During the 30's he performed in "Curro Vargas", "Doña Francisquita", "La Tempestad" and starred in Spanish operas as Bretón's "La Dolores", Vives' "Euda d'Uriach" (1934) and Gaig's "El estudiante de Salamanca" (1935).
Lázaro's career ended in La Habana, Cuba, 1950, with the performances of "Marina", "Aida" and "Rigoletto". Then, he wrote two books: "El libro de mi vida" (1968, "My life book"), an autobiographical work, and "Mi método de canto" (1947, "My singing method"), didactical work for tenor students.
He died 24 years later in his native Barcelona, on May 14, 1974, at the age of 87.

Dee Palmer

Dee Palmer (formerly David Palmer) is an English composer, arranger, and keyboardist best known for having been a member of the rock group Jethro Tull.
Early career.
Palmer studied composition at the Royal Academy of Music with Richard Rodney Bennett, winning the Eric Coates Prize and The Boosey and Hawkes Prize. She was appointed a Fellow of The Royal Academy of Music in 1994.
Jethro Tull and other works.
Going about her early career as a jobbing arranger and conductor of recording sessions, Palmer recorded her first album project, "Nicola", in 1967 with Bert Jansch. She was then referred to Terry Ellis, then manager of the early Jethro Tull, which was making its first album at Sound Techniques Studio in Chelsea, London. At short notice, Palmer came up with arrangements for the horns and strings on the Mick Abrahams composition, "Move on Alone" from the "This Was" album. This work and professional performance endeared her to the band and she was soon to visit them again, with a string quartet arrangement to "A Christmas Song". Palmer arranged string, brass, and woodwind parts for Jethro Tull songs in the late 1960s and early 1970s, before formally joining the group in 1976 and primarily playing electronic keyboard instruments. In 1980, leader Ian Anderson intended to release the album "A" with other musicians as a solo project (under the name 'Ian Anderson') but was persuaded by his record label to release it instead under the 'Jethro Tull' name. This resulted in every member of the group, including Palmer, leaving except guitarist Martin Barre and Anderson himself. Palmer formed a new group, Tallis, with former Jethro Tull pianist and organist John Evan. The new group was not commercially successful, and Palmer returned to film scoring and sessions.
Beginning in the 1980s, Palmer produced several albums of orchestral arrangements of the music of various rock groups, including Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, The Beatles and Queen.
Gender transition.
In 2003, Palmer came out as transsexual and intersex, changing her name to Dee. Palmer was born with genital ambiguity, assigned female at birth, and underwent several surgeries, the last in her late twenties.

Archconfraternity of the Order of the Holy Ghost

The Archconfraternity of the Order of the Holy Ghost of Montpellier of Jerusalem of Cyprus and of Cilicia is an independent Greek Byzantine Catholic confraternity of laymen and clergy organized as a charitable organization. Despite the fact that the Archconfraternity confers the rank of knight upon its senior members and uses the terminology, ceremony and insignia similar to those used by the well known Roman Catholic orders of chivalry, such as the Order of Malta and the Order of the Holy Sepulcher, the organization does not consider itself to be an order of chivalry.
History & Organization.
Founded in 1998 by a group of Anglican and Catholic laymen. The Archconfraternity is a private group, of modern origins, and has no historical connection to the medieval Order of the Holy Ghost founded in France in 1178.
The Archconfraternity is headquartered in Washington D.C. and is organized in a manner similar to that which was used by the Catholic Military Orders during the late Middle Ages. It currently has members in 14 countries.
The Militia of the Holy Ghost was in December 2010 merged with the Royal House Order of Jerusalem and formed a new combined order known as Order of Jerusalem - Militia of The Holy Ghost. The Order of Jerusalem-Militia of The Holy Ghost is a hereditary and dynastic order of the House of La Rochelle - Murat. Deriving it's Fons Honorum from the Kingdom of Naples founded in 1808, the Order of Jerusalem-Militia of The Holy Ghost is a lay religious confraternity, by practice and tradition, both military and chivalrous.

Savage Republic

Savage Republic (originally named Africa Corps) is a Los Angeles based Art Punk band formed in the early 1980s. The group reformed in 2002 and remains active with a different line-up. 
History.
The band was originally named Africa Corps, and was formed by UCLA students Bruce Licher (guitar) and Mark Erskine (drums/percussion). They were joined by Philip Drucker (aka Jackson Del Rey), Robert Loveless, and Jeff Long. Shortly before the release of debut album "Tragic Figures" in 1982 (on Licher's own Independent Project label) they changed their name to Savage Republic. Licher was also responsible for the groups sleeve designs, which were hand-letterpressed and numbered by him. The group split up towards the end of 1983 with a second album partially completed; Loveless and Drucker completed it and it was released as an album ("Jedda By the Sea") by their side-project 17 Pygmies. "Tragic Figures" was issued in Europe in 1984 on the Sordide Sentimental label.
The band returned in 1985 with the album "Ceremonial", followed in 1986 with the "Trudge" mini-LP. A live double album followed later that year. Brad Laner joined prior to the 1988 album "Jamahiriya Democratique et Populaire de Sauvage", and a further studio album ("Customs") was released prior to the band splitting up in 1990. 
Licher continued to run his label, and received a Grammy nomination for the artwork for For Against's debut album. He formed Scenic in the mid-1990s, the group also featuring Loveless and former Shiva Burlesque member James Brenner. Laner went on to form Medicine.
Savage Republic reformed in 2002 with original member Licher and members from the mid-1980s including Greg Grunke, Thom Fuhrmann and Ethan Port, although Licher left after a first tour. The remaining members recorded the album "1938", released by Neurot Recordings in 2007.
Musical style.
The band's music has been described as industrial, with Allmusic's Richie Unterberger describing it as music that "grafted tribal percussion, industrial drones, and raga-like guitar lines together". Unusual percussion was a large part of their sound, incorporating oil cans, and metal pipes. "Trouser Press" described the debut album as "a combination of industrial drone with deep machine-like swaths of dragging bass, Halloween horror-movie screams and some of the most delightfully tribal and tropical percussion found on disc". When the band reformed in 1985 they incporporated more Arabic influences. Later work also incorporated Greek influences. The band's music was described in "Music USA: The Rough Guide" as "hypnotic post-modern raga-rock instrumentals" and "clattering noise-rock jams".

In 1938 Ivan studied in Sevastopol railroad trade school. In 1940 he began his studies in anti-aircraft artillery military academy.
In June 1941, Turkenich graduated from the academy and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Red Army. From May to June 1942 he was a deputy executive officer (помощник начальника штаба) in the 614th anti-tank artillery regiment.

George H. W. Bush Supreme Court candidates

Speculation abounded over potential nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States by George H. W. Bush even before his presidency officially began, given the advanced ages of several justices.
On July 20, 1990, this speculation became newsworthy, due to the announcement of the immediate retirement (and assumption of senior status) of Associate Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. President George H. W. Bush announced David Souter as Brennan's replacement just four days later, and Souter was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 2, 1990 in a 90–9 vote.
On June 27, 1991, Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement (and assumption of senior status), effective October 1, 1991. President George H. W. Bush announced Clarence Thomas as Marshall's replacement just five days later. After a confirmation process filled with allegations of sexual harassment, Thomas was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 15, 1991 in a 52–48 vote.
Overview.
Throughout much of the history of the United States, the Supreme Court of the United States was clearly the least powerful branch of the government, just as is often considered the Founding Fathers' intention, and nominations to that body, although important, were not the source of great political controversy as they are today. Furthermore, Bush's Supreme Court nominations came shortly after the controversial and failed nomination by President Ronald Reagan of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987.
Politics.
Bush showed less interest in issues relating to the Supreme Court than other presidents before and after him. Upon Souter's nomination, Bush made clear that he had no litmus test for court appointees. "You might just think that the whole nomination had something to do with abortion," Bush told reporters upon nominating Souter. "It's something much broader than that. I have too much respect for the Supreme Court for that."
David Souter nomination.
After William Brennan announced his retirement on July 20, 1990, Bush moved swiftly to identify a replacement. The New York Times published a story with a long list of potential nominees whose names had been mentioned. However, ultimately, Bush narrowed down his list on Sunday, July 22, 1990 to just five candidates, all federal appeals court judges: Edith Jones, Laurence H. Silberman, David Souter, Kenneth Starr and Clarence Thomas. Bush was most interested in nominating Thomas, but he and his staff struggled with four issues surrounding Thomas: 1) his short tenure as a judge up to that point (just eight months on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit); 2) the fact that Thomas' appointment at that time would mean that there would be two African-American men on a court of just nine individuals; 3) Bush was saving Thomas for Thurgood Marshall's seat when he eventually retired; and 4) both Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Counsel to President Bush C. Boyden Gray told the president that they felt that Thomas was not yet ready. There were also challenges involving several of the other candidates on Bush's short list. Gray's favorite choice for the seat was Jones, whom Bush formally interviewed for the job. However, Jones was expected to provoke a confirmation battle, given her active history in partisan politics, her frequent appearances at meetings of the Federalist Society and her work with the Andrews Kurth law firm where then-Secretary of State James Baker had been a partner. Silberman also was thought to provoke a confirmation battle in part because his legal views were thought to be similar to those of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Associate Justice Antonin Scalia and also because Silberman had joined a ruling overturning one of Oliver North's convictions regarding the Iran-Contra affair.
Ultimately, Bush chose Souter on July 24, 1990, and Souter was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 2, 1990 in a 90–9 vote. The senators voting against the Souter nomination were Brock Adams (D-WA), Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Bill Bradley (D-NJ), Quentin Burdick (D-ND), Alan Cranston (D-CA), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), John Kerry (D-MA), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD). Senator Pete Wilson (R-CA) did not vote.
Clarence Thomas nomination.
After Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, Bush considered only two choices: Thomas and United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit judge Emilio M. Garza. Bush's strategists told the New York Times that all things being equal, Bush would have preferred to choose Garza. And while White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu strongly favored Garza, Gray and Thornburgh had argued that Garza was "not ready," given that Garza had only been on the Fifth Circuit for a few weeks.
In addition, Thomas had been widely believed to be in the process of being groomed for an eventual Supreme Court appointment since his 1989 appointment by Bush to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Ultimately, on July 2, 1991, Bush chose Thomas as Marshall's replacement. And after a contentious confirmation process that involved allegations of sexual harassment by Thomas, the United States Senate confirmed Thomas in a 52–48 vote on October 15, 1991.
Names frequently mentioned.
Following is a list of individuals who were mentioned in various news accounts and books as having been considered by Bush or being the most likely potential nominees for a Supreme Court appointment under Bush:

Enid Charles (29 December 1894 – 26 March 1972) was a socialist, feminist and statistician who was a pioneer in the fields of demography and population statistics.
She was born Dorothy Enid Charles in Denbigh, Wales. She obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics, economics and statistics at Newnham College, Cambridge University and a Ph.D. in physiology from the University of Cape Town, South Africa. 
Charles met the conscientious objector Lancelot Hogben while at Cambridge; they married in 1918. Out of a dozen or so socialist and feminist couples in Britain in the early 20th century, Charles was the only wife to keep her name. The couple who had two sons and two daughters, separated in 1953 and divorced in 1957.
Charles worked on fertility rates and nuptiality for the Dominion Bureau of Statistics in Canada. In 1934, Charles projected drastic decline in population of the United Kingdom should the fertility rates continue to fall. These results led her to speak out against the then commonly accepted principle of eugenics. She subsequently worked as a Regional Adviser in Epidemiology and Health Statistics and as a Population Statistics Consultant for the World Health Organization in Singapore and New Delhi.
She died in Torquay, England, in 1972, aged 77.

Aldred Building

The Aldred Building (French: Édifice Aldred; also known as Édifice La Prévoyance) is an Art deco building on the historic Place d'Armes square in the Old Montreal quarter of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
Completed in 1931, the building was designed by Ernest Isbell Barott, of the firm Barott and Blackader, with a height of 96 metres (316 ft) or 23 storeys. Built at a cost of $2,851,076.00, Barott endeavored to design a modern building which would, at the same time, fit with the square's historic surroundings. The building's setbacks at the 8th, 13th, and 16th floors allow more light on the square and create a cathedral-like massing, reflecting the adjacent Notre-Dame Basilica. The building uses limestone, common to other buildings in the area. The Aldred Building also attempts to address both Place d’Armes and Notre-Dame Street which do not meet at right angles, aligning with both streets until the third floor, where it then steps back and becomes square to Notre-Dame. The odd angle is small and not immediately noticeable from street-level.
The building resembles New York's Empire State Building, completed the same year, and was built for Aldred and Company Limited, a New York City-based international finance company.
Barott began work on the Aldred Building around 1927, with original design for a building only 12 storeys tall, as building heights were limited to in Montreal until the passing of a bylaw allowing taller buildings provided they made use of setbacks to reduce their overall mass, similar to one in New York City.
Barott was able to take advantage of a 1929 clause in the bylaw that allowed buildings on public squares to exceed the then maximum height by up to , if certain restrictions were adhered to. The building’s total floor area is .
Materials.
The exterior utilizes Indiana limestone set on a granite base in combination with aluminum spandrels. The interior doors are inlaid with white metal, with the exterior gates in bronze. Surrounding the doors and covering the walls and floors of the entrance lobby are a variety of marbles, including Belgian Black, Yellow Sienna, Tinos Greek, St. Genevieve Golden Vein, Verde Antique, and Moutonelle. Flooring above the ground level is made of terrazzo with brass strips. Bronze also makes up the frames for windows of the ground floor bank, and is used in trim throughout the building along with stainless steel. 
The steel structure of the building is supported two floors below street level on a solid concrete mat which is nine feet thick. The steel is fireproofed with terra-cotta tiles and supports reinforced concrete floors. The steel structure allows for a total of 840 windows, which cover approximately 20 percent of the building’s surface area. Numerous services in the Aldred Building identify it as a modern structure, including conditioned ventilation in the basement and first nine floors, with fresh air ‘washed’ and filtered in an air-cleaner. Aldred Building features a central vacuum system, an electric time-clock system, an incinerator, paper baler and an ozone machine in the kitchen to eliminate odours. All the floors contain built-in ducts for electrical and telephone cables. The six high-speed elevators were the most modern available in the day, and were installed by Otis Fensom. The cars travel at per minute and have teak interiors.

Faurea saligna

Faurea saligna is a graceful, semi-deciduous tree of the Proteaceae family growing to about 10 metres, or up to 20 metres under forest conditions. Found from tropical Africa south to the Transvaal, Swaziland and Natal, often in large communities on sandy soil and along stream beds. 
Its dark-grey to black bark is rough and deeply fissured, while the narrow drooping leaves are reminiscent of a willow ("saligna" meaning Salix-like). The timber was much-prized by the Voortrekkers for furniture and they named it "Transvaal Boekenhout" for its resemblance to European Beech. There are some 15 species of "Faurea" occurring in Africa and Madagascar. 
William Henry Harvey named the genus after William Caldwell Faure (1822-1844), a young soldier and enthusiastic botanist who was killed in India, and was the son of a Cape Town Dutch Reformed minister. Faure had accompanied Harvey on numerous botanising excursions, and had left the Cape for India in 1844 having received a commission in the East India Company's military service. He contracted cholera on arriving and was fortunate to recover. A few months later and in the company of a few fellow soldiers, he was shot by a sniper while crossing a ravine in a patch of forest, on the way to rejoining his regiment. He died after some twelve hours.

Flag of Saxony

Both the civil and state flag of the German state of Saxony feature a bicolour of white over green, similar to the Austrian province of Styria. The state flag is similar to the civil flag, except it is defaced in the centre with the coat of arms of Saxony. The colours of both flags were officially decided as state colours in 1815. The aristocracy used mostly and in first time the quadrangular and later the rectangular form. 
Overview.
The civil bicolour flag of white over green was used before World War II, and formally abolished in 1935, under the reforms of the Third Reich. It was readopted 1947 when Saxony became a state again, and abolished 1952 under governing reforms of the German Democratic Republic. When Germany was reunited, Saxony became a state again, and so the flag was finally officially readopted in 1991, having been a much used symbol during the demonstrations in the German Democratic Republic in 1989/90.

The Game (Queen album)

The Game is the eighth studio album by British rock band Queen released on 27 June 1980. It was the only Queen album to reach #1 in the US and became their best selling studio album in the US with four million copies sold to date, tying "News of the World"'s US sales tally. The album received very favourable reviews. Notable songs on the album include the bass-driven "Another One Bites the Dust" and the rockabilly "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", both of which reached #1 in the US. "The Game" was the first Queen album to use a synthesiser (an Oberheim OB-X).
"The Game" features a more pop sound than its predecessor, "Jazz". The album's style would be augmented on Queen's next release "Hot Space", and future Queen albums. At approximately 35 minutes 39 seconds, "The Game" is the second shortest of Queen's studio albums, with their subsequent soundtrack for the film Flash Gordon being shorter by 39 seconds. It is estimated to have sold twelve million copies worldwide, including over 4.5 million copies in the US.
Reissued on May 2003 on DVD-Audio with Dolby 5.1 surround sound and DTS 5.1. The 5.1 mix of "Coming Soon" features an alternate backing track, because the final master tapes were not found when mixing the album to 5.1.
The photo on the cover of the EMI CD is different from that originally used on the LP and cassette even though the Hollywood CD still has the original photo. The original photo (with Roger Taylor having folded arms and Brian May not having a hand resting upon his exposed hip) is shown in the article. This alternate photo was also used on cover of the DTS DVD-Audio edition of the album released in 2003.
"Crazy Little Thing Called Love", "Sail Away Sweet Sister", "Coming Soon" and "Save Me" were recorded from June to July 1979. The remaining songs were recorded between February and May 1980.
Reception.
"Record Mirror" awarded "The Game" 4/5 stars, writing: "After Zeppelin and even before The Scorpions, Queen are the most exciting band I've ever seen or heard. And I'm sure all you lovers of quality music will agree." "Rolling Stone" felt that it was "nice to hear a Queen album with songs, not 'anthems'," but opined that "these guys know how this music should sound and feel, but they can't bend enough to get with it." "The Washington Post" gave a scathing review, writing: "After five years of unchallenging, dismal albums, this was supposed to be Queen's comeback. But no such luck." Steve Taylor, writing for "Smash Hits", was equally as dismissive, writing "sandwiched between two slabs of Queen's usual symphonic and/or choral pomp-rock [...] lies a filling of utterly unoriginal corn". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the album's "disco rock blends" showed a band that has "turned away from rock and toward pop", "turning decidedly, decisively pop, and it's a grand, state-of-the-art circa 1980 pop album that still stands as one of the band's most enjoyable records."
"Creem" readers voted "The Game" the seventh greatest album of 1980. At the Grammy Awards in 1981, Queen and Mack were nominated for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical) while "Another One Bites the Dust" was nominated for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Queen received an American Music Award nomination for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group, while "Another One Bites the Dust" received the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single. In 2008, "Out" ranked the album #28 of 100 in a poll of "more than 100 actors, comedians, musicians, writers, critics, performance artists, label reps, and DJs, asking each to list the ten albums that left the most indelible impressions on their lives." Allmusic would go on to name "The Game" as Queen's best album of the 1980s.

Eleanor Lerman

Eleanor Lerman (born 1952) is an American poet, novelist, and short story writer.
Life and career.
Lerman was born in the Bronx, and raised there and in Far Rockaway. She is a lifelong New Yorker. Lerman is of Jewish heritage.
In 1973 her first book of poetry, "Armed Love", was nominated for a National Book Award. Much attention came to this new and lauded poet. In one of the more controversial reviews of her work, the "New York Times" described her first book as "XX rated" for its frank discussion of sexuality and gender. Although Lerman published a second book in 1975, she stopped publishing poetry in response to the backlash against her work.
She published her third book of poetry twenty-five years later in 2001 when Sarabande Books commissioned "The Mystery of Meteors". Sarabande also published her fourth book of poetry, "Our Post-Soviet History Unfolds" which won the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize in 2006, given by the American Academy of Poets and "The Nation" magazine. In awarding the prize, Tony Hoagland cited Lerman's "vernacular resilience."
For one of her recent books, "The Blonde on the Train," the author has experimented with creating a web site devoted specifically to the book and its contents, including excerpts: http://www.blondeonthetrain.com
Awards.
She has been nominated for a Lambda Literary Award, and in 2006 her fiction collection "Observers and Other Stories" was published by the Lesbian press Artemis Press.
Lerman is also the recipient of the inaugural Juniper Prize, the 2002 Joy Bale Boone Award for Poetry, the 2006 Milton Dorfman Poetry Prize, and a fiction grant from the New York Foundation for the Arts. In 2007, she received a Literature Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2011, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.

<doc id="20432638" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20432638" title="EPUB">
EPUB

EPUB (short for "electronic publication") is a free and open e-book standard by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Files have the extension ".epub".
EPUB is designed for reflowable content, meaning that an EPUB reader can optimize text for a particular display device. EPUB also supports fixed-layout content. The format is intended as a single format that publishers and conversion houses can use in-house, as well as for distribution and sale. It supersedes the Open eBook standard.
History.
EPUB became an official standard of the IDPF in September 2007, superseding the older Open eBook standard.
In August 2009, the IDPF announced that they would begin work on maintenance tasks of the EPUB standard. Two broad objectives were defined by this working group: "One set of activities governs maintenance of the current EPUB Standards (i.e. OCF, OPF, and OPS), while another set of activities addresses the need to keep the Standards current and up-to-date." The working group expected to be active through 2010, publishing updated standards throughout its lifetime. On April 6, 2010, it was announced that this working group would complete their update in April 2010. The result was to be a minor revision to EPUB 2.0.1 that "...corrects errors and inconsistencies and does not change functionality." On July 2, 2010, drafts of the version 2.0.1 standards appeared on the IDPF website.
On April 6, 2010, it was announced that a working group would form to revise the EPUB specification. In the working group's charter draft, 14 main problems with EPUB are identified, which the group will address. The group was chartered through May 2011, and was scheduled to submit a final draft on May 15, 2011. An initial Editors Draft for EPUB3 was published on November 12, 2010, and the first public draft was published on February 15, 2011. On May 23, 2011, the IDPF released its proposed specification for final review. On October 10, 2011, the IDPF announced that its membership had approved EPUB 3 as a final Recommended Specification.
In September 2012, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 re-established Ad Hoc Group 4 on EPUB of IDPF to prepare the creation of a Joint Working Group (JWG) for EPUB. EPUB 3 will be submitted as a Draft Technical Specification by the Korean National Body via the JTC 1 fast-track procedure and it will be assigned to the SC 34/JWG when approved. It is currently under a standardization process under the formal name "ISO/IEC DTS 30135-1 - Information technology - Digital publishing - EPUB3 -- Part 1: EPUB3 Overview".
File format.
Version 3.0 (current version).
The EPUB 3.0 Recommended Specification was approved on 11 October 2011. EPUB 3.0 supersedes the previous release 2.0.1 of EPUB. Detailed descriptions of the differences between 3.0 and 2.0.1 can be found on the IDPF website.
EPUB 3 consists of a set of four specifications:
The EPUB 3.0 format is intended to address the following criticisms:
Version 2.0.1.
EPUB 2.0 was approved in October 2007, with a maintenance update (2.0.1) intended to clarify and correct errata in the specifications being approved in September 2010. EPUB version 2.0.1 consists of three specifications:
EPUB internally uses XHTML or DTBook (an XML standard provided by the DAISY Consortium) to represent the text and structure of the content document, and a subset of CSS to provide layout and formatting. XML is used to create the document manifest, table of contents, and EPUB metadata. Finally, the files are bundled in a zip file as a packaging format.
Open Publication Structure 2.0.1.
An EPUB file uses XHTML 1.1 (or DTBook) to construct the content of a book as of version 2.0.1. This is different from previous versions (OEBPS 1.2 and earlier), which used a subset of XHTML. There are, however, a few restrictions on certain elements. The mimetype for XHTML documents in EPUB is codice_2. For a table of the required XHTML modules and a description of the restrictions, see Section 2.2 of the specification.
Styling and layout are performed using a subset of CSS 2.0, referred to as "OPS Style Sheets". This specialized syntax requires that reading systems support for only a portion of CSS properties and adds a few custom properties. Custom properties include codice_3 and codice_4. Font-embedding can be accomplished using the codice_5 property, as well as including the font file in the OPF's manifest (see below). The mimetype for CSS documents in EPUB is codice_6. For a table of supported properties and detailed information, see Section 3.0 of the specification.
EPUB also requires that PNG, JPEG, GIF, and SVG images be supported using the mimetypes codice_7. Other media types are allowed, but creators must include alternative renditions using supported types. For a table of all required mimetypes, see Section 1.3.7 of the specification.
Unicode is required, and content producers must use either UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding. This is to support international and multilingual books. However, reading systems are not required to provide the fonts necessary to display every unicode character, though they are required to display at least a placeholder for characters that cannot be displayed fully.
An example skeleton of an XHTML file for EPUB looks like this:
<syntaxhighlight lang="html4strict">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">
</html>
</syntaxhighlight>
Open Packaging Format 2.0.1.
The OPF specification's purpose is to "... the mechanism by which the various components of an OPS publication are tied together and provides additional structure and semantics to the electronic publication." This is accomplished by two XML files with the extensions codice_8 and codice_9.
.opf file
The OPF file, traditionally named codice_10, houses the EPUB book's metadata, file manifest, and linear reading order. This file has a root element codice_11 and four child elements: codice_12 and codice_13. All of these except codice_13 are required. Furthermore, the codice_11 node must have the codice_16 attribute. The .opf file's mimetype is codice_17.
The codice_18 element contains all the metadata information for a particular EPUB file. Three metadata tags are required (though many more are available): codice_19 and codice_20. codice_21 contains the title of the book, codice_22 contains the language of the book's contents in RFC 3066 format or its successors, such as the newer RFC 4646 and codice_20 contains a unique identifier for the book, such as its ISBN or a URL. The codice_20's codice_25 attribute should equal the codice_16 attribute from the codice_11 element. For a full listing of EPUB metadata, see Section 2.2 of the specification.
The codice_28 element lists all the files contained in the package. Each file is represented by an codice_29 element, and has the attributes codice_30. All XHTML (content documents), stylesheets, images or other media, embedded fonts, and the NCX file should be listed here. Only the codice_8 file itself, the codice_32, and the codice_33 files should not be included. Note that in the example below, an arbitrary codice_34 is given to the included font file, even though no mimetype exists for fonts.
The codice_35 element lists all the XHTML content documents in their linear reading order. Also, any content document that can be reached through linking or the table of contents must be listed as well. The codice_36 attribute of codice_35 must contain the codice_25 of the NCX file listed in the manifest. Each codice_39 element's codice_40 is set to the codice_25 of its respective content document.
The codice_13 element is an optional element for the purpose of identifying fundamental structural components of the book. Each codice_43 element has the attributes codice_44. Files referenced in codice_45 must be listed in the manifest, and are allowed to have an element identifier (e.g. #figures in the example). A list of possible values for codice_46 can be found in Section 2.6 of the specification.
An example OPF file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package version="2.0" xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" unique-identifier="BookId">
</package>
</syntaxhighlight>
.ncx file
The NCX file (Navigation Control file for XML), traditionally named codice_47, contains the hierarchical table of contents for the EPUB file. The specification for NCX was developed for Digital Talking Book (DTB), is maintained by the DAISY Consortium, and is not a part of the EPUB specification. The NCX file has a mimetype of codice_48.
Of note here is that the values for the codice_49 and codice_50 elements should match their analogs in the OPF file. Also, the codice_51 element is set equal to the depth of the codice_52 element. codice_53 elements can be nested to create a hierarchical table of contents. codice_54's content is the text that appears in the table of contents generated by reading systems that use the .ncx. codice_53's codice_56 element points to a content document listed in the manifest and can also include an element identifier (e.g. #section1).
A description of certain exceptions to the NCX specification as used in EPUB can be found in Section 2.4.1 of the specification. The complete specification for NCX can be found in Section 8 of the "Specifications for the Digital Talking Book".
An example .ncx file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE ncx PUBLIC "-//NISO//DTD ncx 2005-1//EN"
"http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx-2005-1.dtd">
<ncx version="2005-1" xml:lang="en" xmlns="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx/">
</ncx>
</syntaxhighlight>
Open Container Format 2.0.1.
An EPUB file is a group of files that conform to the OPS/OPF standards and are wrapped in a ZIP file. The OCF specifies how to organize these files in the ZIP, and defines two additional files that must be included.
The codice_33 file must be a text document in ASCII that contains the string codice_58. It must also be uncompressed, unencrypted, and the first file in the ZIP archive. This file provides a more reliable way for applications to identify the mimetype of the file than just the codice_1 extension.
Also, there must be a folder named codice_60, which contains the required file codice_32. This XML file points to the file defining the contents of the book. This is the OPF file, though additional alternative codice_62 elements are allowed.
Apart from codice_33 and codice_64, the other files (OPF, NCX, XHTML, CSS and images files) are traditionally put in a directory named codice_65.
An example file structure:
An example container.xml, given the above file structure:
<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<container version="1.0" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:container">
</container>
</syntaxhighlight>
Digital rights management.
An EPUB file can optionally contain DRM as an additional layer, but it is not required by the specifications. In addition, the specification does not name any particular DRM system to use, so publishers can choose a DRM scheme to their liking. However, future versions of EPUB (specifically OCF) "may" specify a format for DRM.
The EPUB specification does not enforce or suggest a particular DRM scheme. This could affect the level of support for various DRM systems on devices and the portability of purchased e-books. Consequently, such DRM incompatibility may segment the EPUB format along the lines of DRM systems, undermining the advantages of a single standard format and confusing the consumer.
When present, DRMed EPUB files must contain a file called codice_66 within the codice_60 directory at the root level of the ZIP container.
Validation.
An open source tool called "epubcheck" exists for validating and detecting errors in the structural markup (OPS, OPF, OCF) as well as the XHTML and image files. The tool can be run from the command line, or used in webapps and applications as a library. A large part of the original work on the tool was done at Adobe Systems.
Software.
Software reading systems.
The following software can read and display EPUB files:
See also the Wikipedia category for articles about EPUB readers.
Hardware reading systems.
Most dedicated e-book readers support the EPUB format, although the Amazon Kindle line of devices is a notable exception. EPUB reading software is also available for all modern smartphones. Devices that support EPUB include:

"I'm No Hero" is a 1980 album by Cliff Richard. It featured the singles "Dreamin'" and "A Little in Love", which were top 20 hits in both the UK and the US.
Background.
Following the success of his 1979 single "We Don't Talk Anymore" which was written and arranged by Alan Tarney, the record company were keen to use his services again. For the follow-up album in 1980, he was employed as producer for the entire album. This gave "I'm No Hero" a cohesive sound but was criticised at the time for being too unadventurous. The songs on the album were similar in style to "We Don't Talk Anymore", but it was also a success, generating two top 20 singles, while the album itself made the top five in the UK.
With the lead single "Dreamin'" released in August 1980, the album came out a few weeks later. "Dreamin'" became a top 10 hit in both the UK and US, while follow-up "A Little in Love", released belatedly in January 1981 reached No.15 in the UK and No.17 in the US. The album itself made No.4 in the UK album charts, but due to the lack of singles, failed to sustain as lengthy a run in the Top 75 as his previous album. The delayed release of the second single was most likely due to the release of "Suddenly", a duet with Olivia Newton-John, which had been featured on the " Xanadu " soundtrack. This was also a top 20 hit in the UK and US - making this the most successful period for Cliff Richard in the American market.
The album received positive reviews and kept Richard high in the charts during this, his revival period. It was also the last time he would appear in the US top 20. Album track "Give a Little Bit More", which was co-written by Andy Hill, who was about to become famous as writer and producer for Bucks Fizz, was released in some countries as a single, as was "In the Night" - although this wasn't the same as the Barbara Dickson song which was released around the time (and was also produced by Tarney). "Give a Little Bit More" gave Richard a third hit from the album in the US, peaking at No.41.
"I'm No Hero" was remastered and re-issued on compact disc in July 2001.

A Man Who Was Superman

A Man Who Was Superman () is a 2008 South Korean film directed by Jeong Yoon-chul. The film applies techniques of Magical realism to problems arising from the Narcissism of small differences that plagues the modern Korean conscience.
Plot.
Song Soo-jung is a producer going on her third year at a small company. Her speciality is filming human interest stories. She is driven to produce these shallow stories for the sake of her ambition of one day becoming Korea's own Oprah Winfrey. However, she is reaching the end of what's left of her pride. After months of not getting paid, one day she leaves her office as usual with the company camera to produce a story on a lion apparently refusing to eat its meal. On her way, however, she comes across a robber, but she is saved somehow by "Superman" in a Hawaiian shirt. Superman claims he's unable to tap into his superhuman powers because "bad guys" have placed kryptonite inside his head. However, he doesn't let that get in his way of helping others, and saving the world from global warming and rescuing a lost puppy. Soo-jung can see this will make a good story and, with a little tweaking and a little fabricating, she produces the "Superman Saves the World" documentary which goes on to be a ratings hit. After an X-Ray examination of "Superman's" skull, it becomes clear that there really is something stuck in his head - a bullet.
However, the true story behind this Superman (whose real name is Lee Hyuk-Suk), is revealed: two major tragedies that befell Hyun-Suk traumatized him and left him believing he was, in fact, Superman. When Lee was a boy, he saw "Superman" with his father, who told him that if he counted to one-hundred, he would become Superman. Caught in a skirmish during the Gwangju Democratization Movement, Lee's father is killed, and the young Lee is shot in the back of the head. Miraculously, he lived with the bullet still lodged in his skull. Years later Lee, his wife, and daughter were hit in a car accident. His wife died instantly, but his daughter survived. In the burning wreckage, Lee told his daughter if she counted to one hundred, he'd turn into Superman to save her. Unfortunately, just as he was running to the car with a fire extinguisher, the bullet in his head caused a seizure, causing him to collapse on the road. As he writhed on the ground in pain, the car exploded with his daughter still inside. None of the onlookers in the crowd attempted to help Lee or his daughter. It was at this moment when mental trauma caused Lee to believe he was Superman. 
Lee lives his life with the belief that he is indeed Superman. Soo-jung follows Lee around as he attempts to help the community in his bizarre fashion. With his "super-deeds" Lee inspires hope within the community and people begin to follow his example. But this change Lee inspired only manifests when he has lost all hope in attempting to rescue a police officer from underneath a burning car. It's at this moment that people help Lee in trying to rescue the police officer. But when Lee attempts to save a child from a burning building, he ends up going in alone. In the collapsing building Lee couldn't find any way to escape, so he ends up jumping out of a window with the child, landing on his head. From there he flies and goes back in time to save himself from the bullet that hits Lee in his childhood. He returns to the present (Sadly, it was all a dream...) where in actuality he died landing on his head saving the child. No one in the crowd helped as they just looked on. In the hospital there appeared to be an "S" when they were about to take his organ. Soo-jung is inspired by Lee's sacrifice and follows his example by helping an old woman. From then on Soo-jung remembers a phrase used by Lee Hyun-Suk when they first met - "Strength doesn't open big iron doors but a small key." This helps the frosty, calculating Soo-jung to awaken to what's truly important in life.
Release.
"A Man Who Was Superman" was released in South Korea on 31 January 2008, and on its opening weekend was ranked fourth at the box office with 206,858 admissions. As of 31 March 2008 it had received a total of 559,867 admissions, and as of 17 February 2008 had grossed at total of $3,848,034.

<doc id="20433024" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20433024" title="Ueli Maurer">
Ueli Maurer

Ulrich "Ueli" Maurer (born 1 December 1950 in Wetzikon) is a member of the Swiss Federal Council and head of the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports (the Swiss defence minister). As a leading figure in the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party, he was elected by the Swiss Federal Assembly to succeed Federal Councillor Samuel Schmid in the Swiss Federal Council election of 10 December 2008 and took office on 1 January 2009. He serves as President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 2013.
Personal background and professional career.
Maurer grew up as the son of a poor farmer in the Zürcher Oberland. After a commercial apprenticeship, Maurer received a federal accountant's diploma. He was director of the Zürich Farmers' Association from 1994 to 2008, and was president of the Swiss Vegetable Farmers' Association and the Farmers' Machinery Association ("Maschinenring") until his election to the Federal Council.
Currently resident in Hinwil in the canton of Zürich, Maurer is married and has six children. He has served in the Swiss Army with the rank of major, commanding a bicycle infantry battalion.
Political career.
Cantonal politics.
From 1978 to 1986, Maurer was a member of the municipal government of Hinwil. He was elected to the cantonal parliament of Zürich in 1983, which he presided over in 1991. In that year, he lost an election to the cantonal government against Moritz Leuenberger, as his opponents derided Maurer's campaign as inept and himself as a naïve devotee of party strongman Christoph Blocher. In the same year's national election, though, Maurer was elected to the National Council.
National career and party presidency.
In 1996, at Blocher's behest, Maurer was elected president of the Swiss People's Party. Not taken seriously at first and parodied by TV comedian Viktor Giacobbo as Blocher's servile sycophant so memorably that his taunted children regularly returned from school in tears, his presidency saw the party double its voter base, establish itself in the French-speaking part of Switzerland and become the country's strongest political party. These successes have been largely credited to Maurer's leadership, who was able to make up a lack of charisma with astonishingly hard work, the imposition of strict party discipline, a keen sense for promising populist issues (such as opposition to European integration, foreigners and political correctness) as well as a penchant for headline-grabbing soundbites, as attested by an often-cited statement of his: "As long as I talk of negroes, the camera stays on me".
As president of the People's Party, Maurer was a leading force behind the party's aggressive and successful populist campaigns – campaigns that drew the ire of the Swiss political mainstream and the concern of foreign observers – signing off on cartoonish posters attacking leftists, foreigners and other undesirables. In a breach with Swiss political etiquette, he did not shy away from direct personal attacks on fellow politicians, labeling the center-right Free Democrats as "softies", Social Democratic voters as deranged, and renegade Federal Councillors Schmid and Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf as "appendices" requiring excision. Nonetheless, Maurer was able to keep his public persona separate from the way his colleagues in Parliament perceived him. In the National Council, his personal stature grew during his service and even political opponents credited his personal integrity, collegial demeanour and solid grasp of political issues. His good professional relations with Social Democratic women representatives were particularly noted by puzzled political observers.
Even as his and his party's star rose, however, relations between Maurer and his longtime mentor Blocher slowly cooled, even though the two men remained strong allies in public. Blocher, used to exercising authoritarian leadership as the party's undisputed leading figure, did not approve of Maurer questioning some of his strategic approaches, and increasingly exercised power through a close-knit circle of followers instead of through Maurer and the party secretariat. In October 2007, after the People's Party won its greatest electoral victory in history, Maurer resigned as party president and was succeeded against his wishes by Toni Brunner, one of Blocher's close confidants, on 1 March 2008. After losing a run-off election for a Council of States seat against Verena Diener, Maurer contented himself with the presidency of the Zürich section of the People's Party.
Federal Council candidacy.
On 27 November 2008, the party's parliamentary group unanimously nominated both Maurer and Blocher as candidates to succeed Schmid as Federal Councillor. With Blocher – who was ousted from the Council in 2007 – considered unelectable by all other parties, the "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" and other Swiss media called Maurer the clear frontrunner for the Council seat even before his nomination. On 10 December 2008 Maurer was elected to the Federal Council in the third round of voting with 122 votes, a margin of a single vote. Maurer was elected Vice President of the Confederation for 2012, alongside President Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf. On 5 December 2012 he was elected President of the Confederation for 2013.

POF Eye

POF Eye is a special-purpose hand-held weapon system similar in concept to the CornerShot that can fire weapons around corners. It was first revealed at the 5th International Defence Exhibition and Seminar (IDEAS 2008), held at the Karachi Expo Centre in November 2008. It is designed for SWAT and special forces teams in hostile situations, particularly counter-terrorism and hostage rescue operations. It allows its operator to both see and attack an armed target without exposing the operator to counter-attack.
Overview.
The system, especially designed for urban combat, anti-terrorist operations and police SWAT operations, was developed by Pakistan Ordnance Factories. Chairman of the POF board, Lt. Gen. Syed Sabahat Husain, told the visiting delegates at IDEAS 2008 that this new product of POF may meet the requirements of law enforcing agencies in order to curb the terrorist activities. The live demonstration of this gun was also shown to the delegates. According to one of the designers, Ashfaq Ahmad, the overall designing and finalizing of this gun took 6 months. Several domestic and international participants and delegates took keen interest in the newly introduced anti-terrorist weapon. Once the weapon is put into mass production, POF would take orders for its supply to prospective local and international buyers.
Variations.
The POF Eye is available in several variations. It can be mounted with
It includes a small high-resolution camera, laser sight and a colour LCD monitor, which can observe and view a target from various vantage points. The video camera enables forces to scan an area prior to pinpointing a target and broadcast the footage directly, in real time, to the operating team behind, or to a Command Post monitor. Its head can turn 75 degrees.

Unique Device Identification

The Unique Device Identification (UDI) System is intended to assign a unique identifier to medical devices within the United States. It was signed into law on September 27, 2007, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. This act includes language related to the establishment of a Unique Device Identification System. When implemented, the new system will require:
A national UDI system will create a common vocabulary for reporting and enhance electronic tracking abilities. Currently, analysis of adverse event reports is limited by the fact that the specific devices involved in an incident are often not known with the required degree of specificity. Without a common vocabulary for medical devices, meaningful analysis based on data from existing voluntary systems is problematic. Reliable and consistent identification of medical devices would enable safety surveillance so that the FDA and manufacturers could better identify potential problems or device defects, and improve patient care.
The UDI is expected to improve patient safety (in part by helping to identify counterfeit products and by improving the ability of staff to distinguish between devices that are similar in appearance but serve different functions), facilitate and improve the recall process, and create efficiences within the medical system.
In the most basic format, the UDI would be a coded number registered with standards organizations, and would incorporate a variety of information, including (but not limited to) the manufacturer of the device, expiry dates, the make and model of the device, and any special attributes that the device may possess. In a medical sense, "device" refers to any product that is not pharmaceutical in nature, and while the FDA have been given approval to exempt some devices, Jay Crowely (who was responsible for implementing the UDI requirements in the Act), has expressed an intent to apply the UDI to "everything until somebody gives us good reason not to", (excluding devices which won't need identification).
Since the passing of the Act, there have been calls for the FDA to publish a timeline for the implementation of the UDI.

It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year

"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year" is a popular Christmas song written in 1963 by Edward Pola and George Wyle. It was recorded and released that year by pop singer Andy Williams for his first Christmas album, "The Andy Williams Christmas Album". However, the song was not released as a promotional single by Williams' record label (Columbia Records) that year, as they instead opted to promote his cover of "White Christmas" as the official promo single from the album.
Background.
The song is a celebration and description of activities associated with the Christmas season, focusing primarily on get-togethers between friends and families. Among the activities included in the song is the telling of "scary ghost stories," a Victorian Christmas tradition that has mostly fallen into disuse, but survives in the Seasonal popularity of numerous adaptations of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol". Other activities mentioned include hosting parties, spontaneous visits from friends, universal social gaiety, spending time with loved ones, sledding for children, kissing under the mistletoe, roasting marshmallows (presumably over a fireplace and not a campfire as in the summer), sharing stories about previous Christmases (including, presumably, the first Christmas), and singing Christmas carols in inclement weather.
In a 2005 interview, Williams discusses how "The Andy Williams Show" figured into his recording of "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year": "George Wyle, who is a vocal director, who wrote all of the choir stuff and all of the duets and trios and things that I did with all the guests, he wrote a song just for the show -- I think the second Christmas show we did -- called "Most Wonderful Time of the Year". So I did that, you know, every Christmas, and then other people started doing it. And then suddenly it's become—not suddenly but over 30 years—it's become a big standard. I think it's one of the top 10 Christmas songs of all time now."
In the issue of "Billboard" magazine dated November 28, 2009, the list of the "Top 10 Holiday Songs (Since 2001)" places the Williams recording of "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year" at No. 5. 2001 also marked the first year in which the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (also known as ASCAP) started compiling data regarding the radio airplay of holiday songs, and although the Williams classic started out at No. 25 of twenty-five songs that were ranked that year, it gained steam over the next ten years, reaching No. 18 in 2002, No. 13 in 2003, and eventually getting to No. 4 in 2010.
The song was also selected as the theme song for Christmas Seals in both 2009 and 2012.
Use in advertising and parodies.
For years, the song was used in a humorous fashion in the Staples office supply retail chain's annual back to school advertising campaign. In the commercials, the parents joyously shop for school supplies to this song in anticipation of the upcoming school year while their children sullenly follow.
Williams returned to the UK singles charts with his 1963 recording in December 2007, thanks to an advertisement for Marks & Spencer, reaching No. 21 in its first appearance in the British charts, also reaching No. 108 on the EU Top 200. It was also used for a Marks & Spencer Christmas advert in 2002.
In the Autumn and early winter of 2011, Nissan Motors advertising for their annual sale included a production number featuring an Andy Williams-like voice actor, with lyrics modified to promote the sale event.
In 2008, Bob Rivers teamed up with Richard Simmons to record a parody version, "It's the Most Fattening Time of the Year." The song is the lead track to the album "More Twisted Christmas". In the parody, Simmons appears as himself, panicked at numerous indulgences occurring in the song, scolding Rivers when he (Rivers) asks for a hot buttered roll, ominously warning him that "I'm watching!!"
The song is also used for promotional reasons during "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"'s "12 Days of Giveaways." Generally, Ellen DeGeneres segues into her giveaways segment by tricking her audience with something embarrassing or dramatic, with the song starting the segment.
In 2013, The Co-Operative's Summer advertising campaign features the song with all Christmas references taken out.

Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs).
The vast majority of laptops on the market (94% in 2011) are manufactured by a small handful of Taiwan-based Original Design Manufacturers (ODM), although their production bases are located mostly in mainland China.
Major relationships include:
ODM Laptop Units sold and Market Shares.
There is a discrepancy between the 2009 numbers due to the various sources cited; i.e. the units sold by all ODMs add up to 144.3 million laptops, which is much more than the given total of 125 million laptops. The market share percentages currently refer to those 144.3 million total. Sources may indicate hard drive deliveries to the ODM instead of actual laptop sales, though the two numbers may be closely correlated.
