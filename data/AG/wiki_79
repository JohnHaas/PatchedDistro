Ajmal Kasab

Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab (Punjabi/‎; 13 July 1987 – 21 November 2012) was a Pakistani militant and a member of the Lashkar-e-Taiba Islamist group, through which he took part in the 2008 Mumbai attacks in India. Kasab was the only attacker captured alive by police.
Kasab was born in Faridkot, Pakistan to a family belonging to the Qassab community. He left his home in 2005, engaging in petty crime and armed robbery with a friend. In late 2007, he and his friend encountered members of Jama'at-ud-Da'wah, the political wing of Lashkar-e-Taiba, distributing pamphlets, and were persuaded to join.
On 3 May 2010, Kasab was found guilty of 80 offences, including murder, waging war against India, possessing explosives, and other charges. On 6 May 2010, the same trial court sentenced him to death on four counts and to a life sentence on five counts. Kasab's death sentence was upheld by the Bombay High Court on 21 February 2011. The verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court of India on 29 August 2012. Kasab was hanged on 21 November 2012 at 7:30 a.m. and buried at Yerwada Jail in Pune.
Early life.
Kasab was born in Faridkot village in the Okara District of Punjab, Pakistan, to Amir Shahban Kasab and Noor Illahi. His father ran a snack cart while his elder brother, Afzal, worked as a labourer in Lahore. His elder sister, Rukaiyya Husain, was married and lived in the village. A younger sister, Suraiyya, and brother, Munir, lived in Faridkot with their parents. The family belongs to the Qassab community.
Kasab briefly joined his brother in Lahore and then returned to Faridkot. He left home after a fight with his father in 2005. He had asked for new clothes on Eid, but his father could not provide them, which made him angry. He engaged in petty crime with his friend Muzaffar Lal Khan, moving on to armed robbery. On 21 December 2007, Eid al-Adha, they were in Rawalpindi trying to buy weapons when they encountered members of Jama'at-ud-Da'wah, the political wing of Lashkar-e-Taiba, distributing pamphlets. They decided to sign up for training with the Lashkar-e-Taiba, ending up at their base camp, Markaz Taiba.
An interrogator and deputy commissioner of the Mumbai Police stated that Kasab spoke rough Hindi and almost no English. Some sources said his father asked him to join Lashkar-e-Taiba so that he could use the money they gave him to support the family. But Kasab's father told reporters, "I don't sell my sons." Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a senior commander of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, reportedly offered to pay his family Rs.150,000 for his participation in the attacks. Another report said the 23-year-old was recruited from his home, in part, based on a pledge by recruiters to pay Rs.100,000 to his family if he became a martyr. Other sources put the reward at US $4,000.
Villagers of Okara claimed on camera that he was at their village six months before the Mumbai attack. They said that he asked his mother to bless him as he was going for Jihad, and claimed that he demonstrated his wrestling skills to a few village boys that day.
Training.
Ajmal Kasab was alleged to be among a group of 24 men who received training in marine warfare at a remote camp in mountainous Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir in Pakistan. Part of the training was reported to have taken place on the Mangla Dam reservoir.
Involvement in 2008 Mumbai attacks.
Kasab was seen on CCTV during his attacks at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus along with another recruit, Ismail Khan. Kasab reportedly told the police that they wanted to replicate the Islamabad Marriott hotel attack, and reduce the Taj Hotel to rubble, replicating the 9/11 attacks in India.
Kasab and his accomplice Abu Dera Ismail Khan, then aged 25, attacked the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus) railway station. They then moved on to attack a police vehicle (a white Toyota Qualis) at Cama Hospital, in which senior Mumbai police officers (Maharashtra ATS Chief Hemant Karkare, encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar and Additional Commissioner of Mumbai Police Ashok Kamte) were travelling. After killing them in a gun battle and taking two constables hostage in the Qualis, Kasab and Ismail Khan drove towards the Metro cinema. Kasab joked about the bulletproof vests worn by the police and killed one constable when his mobile phone rang. The two fired some shots into a crowd gathered at the Metro Cinema. They then drove to Vidhan Bhavan where they fired more shots. Their vehicle had a tire puncture, so they stole a silver Škoda Laura and drove towards Girgaum Chowpatty.
The D B Marg police had received a message from police control at about , that two heavily armed men had gunned down commuters at CST. 15 policemen from D B Marg were sent to Chowpatty to set up a double barricade on Marine Drive. The Škoda reached Chowpatty and halted 40 to 50 feet from the barricade. It reversed and attempted a U-turn. A shootout ensued and Ismail Khan was killed. Kasab lay motionless playing dead. Assistant sub-inspector Tukaram Omble, armed only with a lathi, charged the vehicle, being shot five times. Omble held onto Kasab's weapon, enabling Omble's colleagues to capture Kasab alive. Omble died from the bullet wounds. A mob gathered and attacked the two terrorists, which was captured on video.
Initially Kasab pretended to be dead and was being transported to the Nair Hospital when a police officer discovered Kasab was breathing. Seeing the mutilated body of another slain terrorist Kasab begged doctors to put him on saline, saying "I do not want to die". The doctors who treated Kasab said he had no bullet wounds.
Kasab told police he was trained to "kill to the last breath", Later, after interrogation in the hospital by the police, he said: "Now, I do not want to live", requesting the interrogators to kill him for the safety of his family in Pakistan, who could be killed or tortured for his surrender to Indian police. (Fidayeen suicide squad terrorists were instructed not to be captured and interrogated, use aliases instead of their real names, and hide their nationality. He is also quoted as saying "I have done right, I have no regrets". Reports also surfaced that the group planned to escape safely after the attack.)
Kasab told interrogators that all through the operation, the Lashkar headquarters from Karachi, Pakistan, remained in touch with the group, calling their phones through a voice-over-internet service. Investigators succeeded in reconstructing the group's journey through the Garmin GPS that was found on Kasab. The email sent from a group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen claiming responsibility was traced to a Russian proxy which was traced back to Lahore with the help of the FBI.
Nationality.
Police announced Kasab was a Pakistani national based on his confession and other evidence. Several reporters visited Kasab's village and verified the facts provided by him. Former Pakistan Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif confirmed that Kasab was from Faridkot village in Pakistan, and criticised President Zardari for cordoning off the village and not allowing his parents to meet anyone.
Journalist Saeed Shah travelled to Kasab's village and produced national identity card numbers of his parents. His parents left town on the night of 3 December 2008. Mumbai Joint Police Commissioner of Crime Rakesh Maria said Kasab was from the Faridkot village in the Okara district of Pakistan's Punjab province, and was the son of Mohammed Amir Kasab.
The Mumbai Police said much of the information that Kasab provided proved to be accurate. He disclosed the location of a fishing trawler, MV "Kuber", that the terrorists used to enter Mumbai's coastal waters. He told investigators where his team put the ship captain's body, a satellite phone and a global-positioning device, which the police found.
Pakistani officials, including President Asif Ali Zardari, initially denied Ajmal Kasab was Pakistani. Pakistani government officials attempted to erase evidence that there was a Lashkar-e-Taiba office in Deepalpur. The office was hurriedly closed in the week of 7 December. On the night of 3 December 2008, the parents were whisked away by a "bearded Mullah", and since then, there was evidence of a cover-up by plainclothes police. Villagers changed their stories, and reporters who visit there were intimidated. In early December, Kasab's father admitted in an interview that Kasab was his son.
In January 2009, Pakistan's National Security Advisor Mahmud Ali Durrani admitted to Kasab being a Pakistani citizen while speaking to the CNN-IBN news channel. The Pakistan Government then acknowledged that Ajmal Kasab was a Pakistani, but also announced that Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani had fired Durrani for "failing to take Gilani and other stakeholders into confidence" before making this information public, and for "a lack of coordination on matters of national security."
Police interrogation.
Naming confusion.
On 6 December 2008, "The Hindu" reported that the police officers who interrogated him did not speak his language, Urdu, and misinterpreted his caste origin "kasai", meaning butcher, to be a surname, writing it as "Kasav".
"The Times of India" reported a different version of the error. The paper stated that the police officers correctly understood that Ajmal Kasab does not have a surname. In order to satisfy an administrative requirement that people have surnames, the officers asked Kasab for his father's profession, and decided to use "butcher", or "Kasab" in Urdu, as his surname.
"The Hindu" referred to him as either "Mohammad Ajmal Amir, son of Mohammad Amir Iman" or "Mohammad Ajmal Amir 'Kasab'".
List of various names used to refer to Kasab:
Confessions.
Ammunition, a satellite phone and a layout plan of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus was recovered from Kasab. He described how his team arrived at Mumbai from Karachi via Porbandar. He said that they had received revolvers, AK-47s, ammunition and dried fruit from their coordinator. Kasab told the police that they wanted to replicate the Marriott hotel attack in Islamabad, and reduce the Taj Hotel to rubble, replicating the 11 September attacks in US. Kasab told police that his team targeted Nariman House, where the Chabad center was located, because it was frequented by Israelis, who were targeted to "avenge atrocities on Palestinians."
Kasab told the police that he and his associate, Ismail Khan, were the ones who shot Anti-Terror Squad chief Hemant Karkare, encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar and Additional Commissioner Ashok Kamte. Kasab entered the Taj posing as a student from Mauritius and stored explosives in one of the hotel's rooms. In December 2009, Kasab retracted his confession in court, claiming he had come to Mumbai to act in Bollywood films and was arrested by the Mumbai police three days before the attacks.
Confessions on video.
Kasab repeatedly asked the interrogators to turn the camera off and warned them he would not speak otherwise. Nonetheless the following confessions were recorded on video:
When police asked Kasab what he understood about jihad, Kasab told the interrogators "it is about killing and getting killed and becoming famous." "Come, kill and die after a killing spree. By this one will become famous and will also make Allah proud."
According to an officer Kasab spoke Pathani Hindi, and told the police that he threw up the moment he saw all the blood and gore. "Kasab said that he could not bear the sight of dead bodies and after creating enough havoc wanted to go back to Pakistan," the officer said.
"We were told that our big brother India is so rich and we are dying of poverty and hunger. My father sells dahi wada in a stall in Lahore and we did not even get enough food to eat from his earnings. I was promised that once they knew that I was successful in my operation, they would give 150,000 rupees (around US$ 3,352), to my family," said Kasab.
Police said they were shocked by his readiness to switch loyalties after he was apprehended. "If you give me regular meals and money I will do the same for you that I did for them," he said.
"When we asked whether he knew any verses from the Quran that described jihad, Kasab said he did not," police said. "In fact he did not know much about Islam or its tenets," according to a police source.
Face to face with Abu Jundal.
On 9 August 2012, Kasab was brought face-to-face with Abu Jundal, the handler of Mumbai attacks, at the Arthur Road jail where they identified each other. Kasab also admitted that Jundal had taught him Hindi.
Other reports.
In a press conference, the Mumbai city police commissioner said "The person we have caught alive is certainly a Pakistani. They were all trained by ex-army officers, some for a year, some for more than a year". On 23 November 2008 they set sail from Karachi unarmed to be picked up by a larger vessel. They hijacked the Indian fishing trawler "Kuber" and set sail for Mumbai.
"The Times" reported on 3 December 2008 that Indian police were going to submit Kasab to a narco analysis test to definitively determine his nationality.
According to "DNA India", Kasab began reading the autobiography of India's non-violent leader Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in early March 2009, in response to coaxing by prison guards.
Legal issues.
Several Indian lawyers refused to represent Kasab citing ethical concerns. A resolution was passed unanimously by the Bombay Metropolitan Magistrate Court's Bar Association, which has more than 1,000 members, saying that none of its members would defend any of the accused of the terror attacks. Other bar associations passed similar resolutions. The Hindu nationalist group Shiv Sena threatened lawyers against representing him. When one attorney, Ashok Sarogi, hinted that he would be willing to represent Kasab, Shiv Shena members protested outside his home and pelted it with stones, forcing him to retract. In December 2008, the Indian Chief Justice K. G. Balakrishnan said that for a fair trial, Kasab needed a lawyer.
Kasab wrote to the Pakistani High Commission in India requesting help and legal aid. In the letter, he confirmed he and the nine slain terrorists were Pakistani. He asked the Pakistani High Commission to take custody of the body of fellow terrorist Ismail Khan. Pakistani officials confirmed the receipt of the letter and were reported to be studying it. No further updates were given.
On April 1, 2009, Senior Advocate Anjali Waghmare agreed to represent Kasab, despite Shiv Sena activists having protested and stoned her home.
Trial.
His conviction was based on CCTV footage showing him striding across the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus with an AK-47 and a backpack. Towards the end of December 2008, Ujjwal Nikam was appointed as Public Prosecutor for trying Kasab and in January 2009 M. L. Tahiliyani was appointed the judge for the case. Indian investigators filed an 11,000 page Chargesheet against Kasab on 25 February 2009. Due to the fact that the chargesheet was written in Marathi and English, Kasab requested an Urdu translation of the charge sheet. He was charged with murder, conspiracy and waging war against India along with other crimes. His trial was originally scheduled to start on 15 April 2009 but was postponed as his lawyer, Anjali Waghmare was dismissed for a conflict of interest. It resumed on 17 April 2009 after Abbas Kazmi was assigned as his new defence counsel. On 20 April 2009, the prosecution submitted a list of charges against him, including the murder of 166 people. On 6 May 2009, Kasab pleaded not guilty to 86 charges. The same month he was identified by eyewitnesses who testified witnessing his actual arrival and him firing at the victims. Later the doctors who treated him also identified him. On 2 June 2009, Kasab told the judge he also understood the Marathi language.
In June 2009, the special court issued non-bailable warrants against 22 absconding accused including Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafeez Saeed and chief of operations of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Zaki-ur-Rehman Laqvi. On 20 July 2009 Kasab retracted his non-guilty plea and pleaded guilty to all charges. On 18 December 2009, he retracted his guilty plea and claimed that he was framed and his confession was obtained by torture. Instead he claimed to have come to Mumbai 20 days before the attacks and was simply strolling at Juhu beach when police arrested him. The trial concluded on 31 March 2010 and on 3 May the verdict was pronounced — Kasab was found guilty of murder, conspiracy, and of waging war against India (which also carried the death penalty). On 6 May 2010, he was sentenced to death.
A Bombay High Court bench, composed of Justice Ranjanaa Desai and Justice Ranjit More, heard Kasab's appeal against the death penalty and upheld the sentence given by the trial court in their verdict on 21 February 2011. On 30 July 2011, Kasab moved to Supreme Court of India, challenging his conviction and sentence in the case. Thus, a bench composed of Justice Aftab Alam and Justice Chandramouli Kr. Prasad stayed the orders of the Bombay High Court so as to follow the due process of law, and started hearing the case.
On 29 August 2012, Kasab was found guilty of waging war and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India.
Execution.
Kasab's plea for clemency was rejected by President Pranab Mukherjee on 5 November 2012. On 7 November, Minister of Home Affairs Sushilkumar Shinde confirmed the President's rejection of the petition. The following day, the Maharashtra state government was formally notified and requested to take action. The date of 21 November was then fixed for the execution, and the Indian government faxed their decision to the Pakistani Foreign Office.
Everything so far on secret basis, Kasab was formally informed of his execution on 12 November, after which he requested government officials to inform his mother. On the night of 18–19 November, a senior prison official at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai read Kasab's death warrant to him, informing him at the same time that his petition for clemency had been rejected. Kasab was then asked to sign his death warrant, which he did. He was secretly transferred under heavy guard to Yerwada Jail in Pune, arriving in the early morning of 19 November. The death and funeral of nationalist politician Bal Thackeray also aided in diverting attention from Kasab. An officer at Arthur Road Jail stated anonymously: "Throughout the journey from Mumbai to Pune, he did not cause any trouble. Kasab's attitude was of resignation when he came to know that his mercy petition was rejected by the president. Kasab did not shed a single tear during the last few days."
Only the jail superintendent at Yerwada was made aware of Kasab's identity. Kasab was placed in a special cell when he was at Yerwada and no other inmates were informed of his presence. It was only a few minutes before Kasab's execution that the executioner was informed whom he would be hanging.
Though reportedly nervous in the final minutes before his execution, Kasab remained quiet and offered prayers. He was hanged on 21 November 2012 at 7:30, according to an announcement by Home Minister Shinde. Kasab's execution by the Maharashtra government happened barely two weeks after President Pranab Mukherjee rejected his mercy petition on November 5."
After the government contemplated burial at sea, the decision was finally made to bury Kasab at Yerwada Jail. Following his execution, Kasab's body was given to a maulvi for burial in accordance with Islamic rites. Ansar Burney, a human rights activist in Pakistan, later offered to help repatriate Kasab's body to Pakistan citing humanitarian reasons. The Indian government stated it would consider a formal application if offered. Shinde later stated that Kasab's body was buried in India because Pakistan had refused to claim it.
Reaction.
Authorities in Uttar Pradesh banned all celebrations and public gatherings and placed the state on high alert in response. Similarly, the Coimbatore City Police took a group of people in Coimbatore into preventive custody for celebrating Kasab's death. K. Unnikrishnan, father of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, said though the execution was necessary, it was not something to "rejoice over" and that the ensuing celebrations were "foolishness."
In Pakistan, the general and official government response was muted, with the media treating the execution as another news item, according to "The Hindu". Though some journalists attempted to elicit statements from villagers in Kasab's village of Faridkot, they met with a hostile response. A senior LeT commander issued an anonymous statement, saying Kasab was a hero who would "inspire more fighters to follow his path." The Pakistani Taliban's spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan issued a statement threatening Indians with retaliation and declaring Kasab would be avenged. Ehsan also made demands for Kasab's body to be returned to his family. "If they don't return his body to us or his family we will capture Indians and will not return their bodies."
While commending on the well appreciated role of two women officers in the smooth handling of the execution, Patil later responded to threats to avenge Kasab's death by stating that anybody daring to attack the soil of Maharashtra would meet the same fate.
Hafiz Saeed and thousands of others offered "ghayabana namaz-e-janaza" (funeral prayers in absentia) for Kasab at a Jamaat-ud-Dawah session in Muridke. Hundreds of others in Srinagar also offered similar prayers at the appeal of Syed Ali Geelani.

Jack Watts (footballer)

Jack Watts (born 26 March 1991) is an Australian rules footballer for the Melbourne Football Club, in the Australian Football League (AFL). He was the number one draft pick in the 2008 AFL Draft.
Early life.
Though a skilled junior footballer, Watts was also a very promising junior basketball player who could have pursued a professional career in the sport after representing Victoria in under 18 state titles but decided instead to focus on an AFL career.
Junior career.
TAC Cup and APS.
Watts played under 18 football with the Sandringham Dragons in the TAC Cup, and attended Brighton Grammar School competing in the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS). He represented Vic Metro in 2008, winning the Larke Medal and All-Australian honours and performed well at the 2008 AFL Draft Camp. He recorded the second fastest time by a non-indigenous player in the 20 metres sprint with 2.82 seconds.
AFL career.
2008 Draft.
In the lead up to the 2008 AFL Draft, it was widely tipped that Melbourne, possessing the first overall selection would take either Watts, Nic Naitanui of Swan Districts, or Daniel Rich of Subiaco. Ultimately on 29 November 2008, Melbourne selected Watts with the first pick.
2009.
Watts was awarded Melbourne's No. 4 guernsey, a guernsey previously worn by club legends Norm Smith and Ron Barassi, in a ceremony at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Watts made his debut for the Melbourne Football Club against the Collingwood Football Club in the annual AFL Queen's Birthday Clash at the MCG on Monday, 8 June. Melbourne was defeated by 66 points (11 goals) by Collingwood.
2010.
After a small injury in the pre-season Watts began the 2010 season slowly, playing for the Casey Scorpions, Melbourne's affiliate club, in the VFL. Watts played his first match for Melbourne in 2010, in round 8, against the West Coast Eagles, at the MCG. Watts had 15 possessions and took several contested marks, in a solid performance. The match was notable for the fact that it was the first time Watts had played against his draft contemporary; Nic Naitanui. Naitanui was the number two pick from the 2008 draft, where opinion was divided on who would be taken at number one.
2011.
Watts showed solid improvement in the 2011 season, he played all 22 games and kicked 21 goals which included kicking a career high 3 goals on two occasions. At the end of the season, Watts finished equal 9th with Jordie McKenzie in Melbourne's Best and Fairest.
2012.
After showing inconsistency in the forward line for the first few weeks of the season, Watts was dropped to the VFL until he made his return to the Demons side as a defender. While taking on the role, Watts arguably played the best football of his career between rounds 8 and 15 which included a career high 34 possessions against the Sydney Swans. Undoubtedly, Watts' career highlight was to lead the league in intercept marks over a three week period during 2012. After round 15, Watts suffered an injury and didn't return to the side until round 21.
2013.
Watts had a poor start to the 2013 AFL season with some underwhelming performances in the back line. Despite stating that Watts would play as a defender during the 2013 AFL season, Mark Neeld returned Watts to the forward line before his sacking. During the second half of the season, Watts found form as a forward where he kicked 18 goals in 11 games including two hauls of 4 goals against the Western Bulldogs in rounds 14 and 23. Watts earned three votes in the 2013 Brownlow Medal for his efforts in round 14 which included a match saving mark in defence in the dying stages of the game.
During the 2013 season, there was much speculation that Watts was unhappy with the Melbourne Demons and would request a trade to another club. Shortly after the appointment of Paul Roos as senior coach, Watts re-signed with the Demons for three years.
Style of play.
Watts is an athletic, strong-marking tall forward with pace who is an excellent shot on goal.

Probabilistic data association filter

The probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) is a statistical approach to the problem of plot association in a radar tracker, in which all of the potential candidates for association to a track are combined in a single statistically most probable update, taking account of the statistical distribution of the track errors and clutter and assuming that only one of the candidates is a target, and the rest are false alarms. An extension of the PDAF is the Joint Probabilistic Association Filter which takes account of the situation where more than one of the potential candidates represents an actual target.

In his second season, Naitanui played every game, primarily as a back-up ruckman to Dean Cox, taking over the position of Mark Seaby, who was traded the previous season. Having started the season as the favourite for the AFL Rising Star, Naitanui finished 5th overall. In the 2011 season, he played 23 games, including his first finals matches, and was also nominated for Mark of the Year. He was named in the All-Australian team the following season, as the first-choice ruckman.
Early life.
Along with his twin brother, Mark, Naitanui was born to Bola and Atetha Naitanui on 4 May 1990 in Penrith, New South Wales, New South Wales. His parents, originally from Suvavou, a small village near Suva, had emigrated to Australia from Fiji the previous year, with his two elder siblings, Georgie and Laisani, remaining in Fiji. His father died from cancer the year after Naitanui and his brother were born. After his father's death, his mother moved the family to Perth, Western Australia, where her brother lived. His mother began working at Homeswest, a public housing authority, and also volunteered at a homeless shelter. Naitanui grew up in Midvale, near Midland, and attended Midvale Primary School. He took up playing football at the age of nine, when he began playing for the Midvale Junior Football Club. As a child, he lived on Bushby Street in Midvale, along with Michael Walters and Chris Yarran, who would both go on to play AFL football, for and , respectively. Two further future AFL players, David Ellard and Jeff Garlett (both Carlton), also played with Naitanui, Walters and Yarran at the Midvale Junior Football Club.
Naitanui attended Governor Stirling Senior High School and played football there, as well as for his club, the Swan Districts Colts (underage) side in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). During his time in junior and colts football, he played predominantly in the ruck, however he also was used on the wing or at full-back. Naitanui also excelled at basketball and track and field events, particularly high jump, and was asked by recruiters to trial with American universities, but declined to do so.
In the 2007 Under-18 AFL National Championships, Naitanui was dominant in the ruck for Western Australia, and was named Best On Ground in the final. Following his performance, he was hotly pursued by several AFL clubs. However, he was born just a few days too late to qualify for the 2007 AFL draft. He was named in the Under-18 All-Australian Team in both 2007 and 2008, and was awarded a scholarship with the Australian Institute of Sport to become a member of the AIS/AFL Academy Squad.
A much-hyped Naitanui was invited to the 2008 AFL Draft Camp and his results were impressive. He managed to equal the running vertical jump record previously set by Jared Brennan, but just fell short of Trent Croad's standing jump record. His sprint, agility and endurance tests were also impressive.
Many media commentators believed that Naitanui was in contention to be taken as the number 1 pick in the 2008 AFL Draft. The Melbourne Football Club, who retained that pick, had looked at Naitanui, but raised concerns about his skill level, in particular his kicking, and instead selected Victorian Jack Watts.
AFL career.
Naitanui was taken at pick No. 2 overall in the 2008 AFL Draft by the West Coast Eagles in 2006. As a highly rated future player by John Worsfold, Naitanui was given the number 9 guernsey, becoming the first West Coast Eagles player to wear the number since Brownlow Medalist and former captain Ben Cousins left the club at the end of the 2007 season. His first game at the senior level was on 13 June 2009 when he was named to play against Richmond in game 12 of the 2009 season.
His career suffered a setback, however, during pre-season training when he experienced knee soreness and had precautionary surgery.
Naitanui impressed enough in the WAFL in a game where he accumulated 15 possessions, 21 hit-outs, 4 goals and a spectacular mark, to earn his selection in the Round 12 against Richmond at Etihad Stadium.
His debut game impressed many, demonstrating his athletic ability with another spectacular mark as well as 3 kicks, 8 handballs, 3 marks and 7 hitouts. In his second game against premiers Hawthorn at Subiaco, Naitanui was quiet for the first three quarters but dazzled in the fourth, kicking three goals and leading his team to a come-from-behind win.
Naitanui was honoured with a nomination for the NAB Rising Star in Round 4, 2010 in the West Coast Eagles win over the Essendon Bombers, a match where Natanui dominated with 13 disposals, 5 tackles and 17 hitouts. Naitanui took out the West Coast's Rookie of the Year Award for the 2010 Season and finished fifth in the 2010 Club Champion Award.
In March 2012, a viral video of Naitanui performing a slam dunk at a Perth Wildcats basketball game received over 100,000 views on YouTube.
On 17 September 2012 Naitanui earned his first All Australian Team nomination being named as the starting Ruckman.
On the Friday Night game against North Melbourne in Round 8, 2013, Naitanui took a memorable pack mark 30m out with seconds left on the clock. He proceeded to kick a goal after the siren to win the game by 2 points, becoming the 35th AFL player to do so.

Adam Stanisław Grabowski

Adam Stanisław Grabowski (; Wielki Buczek, near Debrzno, 3 September 1698 – 15 December 1766, Lidzbark Warmiński), of the "Zbiświcz" coat-of-arms, was Bishop of Chełmno 1736–39, Bishop of Kujawy 1739–41, Prince-Bishop of Warmia 1741–66.
Life.
Grabowski was the son of Schlochau assessor (Człuchów "iudex terrestris" district judge) Andreas Theodor Grabowski and his wife Barbara Sofia von Kleist. He attended Jesuit schools in Chojnice and Toruń, then studied law in Rome. For a time he was a court scribe "(pisarz sądowy)" in Skarszewy, then was secretary to Crown Deputy Chancellor Andrzej Lipski and became an official in the Crown Chancellery.
In 1730 Grabowski took holy orders and, as a trusted associate of Chancellor Jan Aleksander (?) Lipski, quickly accumulated lucrative benefices. He received canonicates in Lwów and Włocławek, a deanery in Chełmno, and presbyteries in Jaworowo, Skaryszew and Tujce. In 1733 he became the Poznań suffragan.
During the 1733–34 interregnum, Grabowski backed August III, later taking part in his coronation. In 1734 he worked to win the Royal Prussia "szlachta" (nobility) for August III, then was the king's envoy to Rome, where he obtained Pope Clement XIII's support for August III's election as King of Poland.
As a reward for his mission to Rome, in 1736 Grabowski was appointed Bishop of Chełmno. In 1737 he returned to Poland. In 1739 he was transferred to the more lucrative Kujawy Bishopric. He participated actively in the 1738 and 1740 "sejm"s (parliaments). On 14 April 1741 he was preconized Bishop of Warmia.
Grabowski allied himself with the Czartoryski "Familia" and carried out in Royal Prussia
the court's policy of blocking the general sejmiks. In 1743–44 he was president of the Radom Treasury Tribunal. In a speech before the Grodno Sejm in 1744, he conditioned an expansion of the army on improvement in the national economy. He participated in the sejms of 1746 and 1748.
In 1749 he was royal commissioner in Gdańsk, where he resolved disputes between the Council and the burgher opposition. From 1746 he headed a commission that oversaw the reconstruction of a sluice dividing the Vistula River into the Nogat and Leniwka Rivers. 
During the Seven Years' War, Grabowski gave financial assistance to King August III and sought to protect Warmia from armies marching across her territory. In the face of mounting conflict between the Czartoryskis and the royal court, he declared in favor of the King and gradually withdrew from politics, maintaining his neutrality in a dispute between "Prussian patriots" and Pomeranian Governor "(Wojewoda)" Paweł Mostowski. During the 1763–64 interregnum, he recognized Stanisław August Poniatowski as king. In 1765 he sold his Warsaw palace for a national mint. At King Stanisław August's request, not long before his death in 1766 he accepted Ignacy Krasicki as his coadjutor with right of succession.
During his reign over Warmia, Grabowski was the first to use the metropolitan's pallium and cross, granted in Pope Benedict XIV's bull of 24 September 1742. Bishop Grabowski was a good husbandman and patron of the arts. At a 1748 conference of cities, he brought about a revision of 1718 tax rates and a more equitable distribution of fiscal burdens. At a conference of Warmia estates in Orneta on 4 July 1766, he issued ordinances regulating the everyday lives of Warmians in relation to agriculture, trade and crafts. The ordinances had been discussed with the Warmia chapter. In the realm of cartography and land reclamation he collaborated with Jan Suchodolec, son of a Protestant Polish Brother who had found refuge at Alt Rosenthal (today Stara Różanka), near Rastenburg (today Kętrzyn) in the Lutheran Kingdom of Prussia.
At Grabowski's initiative, the chapel at Lidzbark Castle received a Rococo decor, and before the castle's eastern wing there appeared a new structure, "Grabowski's palace." Grabowski also founded a church at Franknowo, financed the rebuilding of churches in Lamkowo, Bisztynek and Königsberg, and bestowed main altars upon the Dobre Miasto collegiate church, St. Nicholas' Church in Elbląg, and Frombork Cathedral. Grabowski also restored the bishops' summer residence at Smolajny.
He gave financial support to Stanisław Konarski's initiatives such as the Collegium Nobilium. He maintained close contacts with men of learning such as Jan Daniel Janocki. He passed on to Gottfried Lengnich for printing a 1426 manuscript of Kadłubek's "Chronicles" that he had found, and the "Heilsberg manuscript" of Gallus Anonymus. It was thanks to Grabowski that Johann Friedrich Endersch's map of the diocese (the "Map of Holy Warmia") was published. He himself took an interest in the history of art and gathered extensive collections of books, statues, paintings and porcelain.
He was a representative of the early Catholic Enlightenment in Poland.
Grabowski was interred at Frombork Cathedral.

Tamisier

François Tamisier (1809, Lons-le-Saunier, Jura – 1880) was a French artillery captain of the 19th century. He invented various methods to improve the rifled gun, particularly ball grooves (not to be confused with the Minié ball). 
Ball grooves.
Captain Tamisier obtained a patent in 1841 for a method to improve the accuracy of cylindro-conical shot, by cutting three sharp grooves (French: ""cannelures"") on the cylindrical part of the shot.
Compared to round shots, which offered a rather inefficient but symmetrical and stable aerodynamic round profile, the aerodynamic stability of the cylindro-conical shot had been an issue in early rifled weapons of the type developed by Delvigne. Through Tamisier's method, the resistance of the air behind the center of gravity of the shot was increased, thereby increasing its stability, in a manner similar to that of arrow feathers in an arrow (fletching), or shuttlecocks. The shot would thus remain stable in flight and increase greatly in efficiency. Tamisier had experimented with the ball developed by Delvigne to discover the effect of aerodynamic resistance on the trajectory of a bullet.
The Tamisier grooves greatly improved the efficiency of the cylindro-conical bullet. However they rendered the forcing of the bullet against the grooves of the rifle bore in the Delvigne system rather difficult. To accommodate this difficulty, the stem rifle was developed by Thouvenin. These principles were later incorporated in the design of the Minié ball.
Progressive rifle grooves.
Tamisier also developed a method for making rifle grooves, which was original in that the grooves were deeper at the breech and progressively shallower towards the muzzle. This provided for a progressive forcing of the ball as it moved through the barrel, greatly improving its efficiency.

Zhidu Temple Pagoda

The Zhidu Temple Pagoda () of Zhuozhou, Hebei province, China, is a pagoda dating from the Liao dynasty.
History.
For thirty years during the 20th century, the pagoda remained intact. In 1925, as a result of Chiang Kai-Shek’s Northern Expedition, fighting erupted in the Zhuozhou area. Amid fighting, the pagoda was repeatedly shelled which resulted in heavy damage. In 1976 nearby Tangshan experienced a massive earthquake which caused the pagoda to crack. Because of all the damage to the pagoda, its height had been reduced from 44 meters to 39 meters. In order to repair all the damage, the pagoda was renovated by the Hebei government in 2005. 
Pagoda.
The pagoda is eight-sided, has five floors and is built from black bricks. The tapering of the pagoda is not large, with the first floor’s diameter being 6.5 meters and the top’s being 5.05 meters. Each floor’s support pillars are not tapered, a particular feature of many Liao dynasty pagodas.

History of Pomerania (1806–1933)

History of Pomerania (1806–1933) covers the History of Pomerania (, ) from the early 19th century until the rise of Nazi Germany.
The name "Pomerania" comes from Slavic po more, which means Land at the Sea.
From the Napoleonic Wars to the end of World War I, Pomerania was administered by the Kingdom of Prussia as the Province of Pomerania (Western (Hither) and Farther Pomerania) and Province of West Prussia (Pomerelia). After World War I Pomerania was divided between Poland and Germany. After the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II as Emperor of Germany and King of Prussia, Western Pomerania was part of the Free State of Prussia within the Weimar Republic, while the eastern part (Pomerelia) became a part of Poland, and organized into the Pomeranian Voivodeship. The Polish Corridor of the Second Polish Republic was established from the bulk of West Prussia, causing an exodus of the German minority there. Poland build a large Baltic port at Gdynia (Gdingen). The Danzig (Gdansk) area became the city state Free City of Danzig.
The industrial revolution had an impact primarily on the Stettin area and the infrastructure, while most Pomerania retained a rural and agricultural character. Since 1850, the net migration rate was negative, German Pomeranians emigrated primarily to Berlin, the west German industrial regions and oversees. Many also immigrated to the United States, especially the state of Wisconsin, which was founded in 1848.
Napoleonic Wars and its consequences.
After Prussia lost the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in late 1806, French troops marched north into the Pomeranian province. Fortified Stettin surrendered without battle, and the province became occupied by the French forces. Only fortified Kolberg resisted, and the French laid a siege in March 1807. Ferdinand von Schill was among the defendants. The siege was not successful and was lifted only when Prussia surrendered to Napoleon Bonaparte in the Peace of Tilsit on July 2.
Napoleonic occupation also thwarted Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden's plans to construct a fortified port city on Rügen, Gustavia. Constructions had begun in 1806, but the unfinished town was levelled by the French forces already in the following year.
The terms of surrender included high war reparations (25,000,000 Taler from the Province of Pomerania alone). The agreed on withdrawal of the French troops was delayed repeatedly. In November 1808, the French troops left the province except for Stettin, which forced the provincial government to move to Stargard in 1809. The Kriegs- und Domänenkammer was renamed Royal-Prussian government ("Königlich Preußische Regierung"), while the former government ("Regierung") was renamed Supreme State Court ("Oberlandesgericht").
In 1812, French troops invaded Swedish Pomerania, and also occupied Prussian Pomerania again. The Prussian troops took quarter in Kolberg. After Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, who commanded a Prussian corps with a significant Pomeranian share, had left the coalition with France in the Convention of Tauroggen of December 30, 1812, the Prussian military called the Pomeranians to arms in February 1813. Also in February, Russian troops reached Farther Pomerania. In March, all French forces left Pomerania, except for Stettin, which was held by the French until December 5, 1813. After the war, Prussia after diplomatic efforts of Karl August von Hardenberg in the Congress of Vienna gained Swedish Pomerania by paying 2,6 million Taler to Denmark and granting her the Duchy of Lauenburg, and paying an additional 3,5 million Taler to Sweden on June 7, 1815. On October 23, Swedish Pomerania was merged into the Prussian province, both now constituting the Province of Pomerania.
After Napoleon's break-up of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Western Part was the member of the German Confederation. After foundation of the German Empire of 1871, the whole of Pomerania was included into the newly created state.
The Pomeranian provinces between 1815 and World War I.
Province of Pomerania before World War I.
The Province of Pomerania () was a province of the Kingdom of Prussia and the Free State of Prussia from 1815 until 1934.
Creation and administration of the province within the Kingdom of Prussia.
Although there had been a Prussian Province of Pomerania before, the Province of Pomerania was newly reconstituted in 1815, based on the "decree concerning improved establishment of provincial offices" (), issued by Karl August von Hardenberg on 30 April, and the integration of Swedish Pomerania, handed over to Prussia on October 23.
The Hardenberg decree reformed all Prussian territories, which henceforth formed ten (later eight) provinces with similar administration. After the implementation of the reform, the new Province of Pomerania consisted basically of her predecessor and Swedish Pomerania, but also of the Dramburg and Schivelbein counties.
The province was headed by a governor ("Oberpräsident", literally "superior president") with his seat in the capital, Stettin. It was subdivided into government regions ("Regierungsbezirke") headed by a president ("Regierungspräsident"). Initially, two such regions were planned (Regierungsbezirk Stettin, comprising Western Pomerania, and Regierungsbezirk Köslin, comprising Farther Pomerania). Hardenberg however, who as the Prussian chief diplomat had settled the terms of session of Swedish Pomerania with Sweden at the Congress of Vienna, had assured to leave the local constitution in place when the treaty was signed on June 7, 1815. This circumstance led to a creation of a third government region, Regierungsbezirk Stralsund, for the former Swedish Pomerania at the expense of the Stettin region.
In early 1818, governor Johann August Sack had reformed the county ("Kreis") shapes, yet adopted the former shape in most cases. Köslin government region comprised nine counties, Stettin government region thirteen, and Stralsund government region four (identical with the previous Swedish Amt districts).
The new parliament ("Landtag") assembled first on October 3, 1824. Based on two laws of June 5 and July, 1823, the "Landtag" was constituted by 25 lords and knights, 16 representatives of the towns, and eight from the rural communities.
Subordinate to the provincial "Landtag" were two "Kommunallandtag" assemblies, one for former Swedish Pomerania (Western Pomerania north of the Peene river) and one for the former Prussian part.
The counties each assembled a "Kreisstand", where the knights of the county had a vote each and towns also just one vote.
Throughout its existence, the province was a stronghold of the conservative parties.
Reorganisation of Catholic Church institutions in Pomerania.
With the conversion of most Pomeranians to Lutheranism in the 16th and 17th centuries the Duchy of Pomerania turned into a Catholic diaspora. However, the repopulation policy under Frederick II of Prussia brought about the settlement of Palatine Catholics in Pomerania in 1748. So their three newly founded villages of Blumenthal (a part of today's Ferdinandshof), Hoppenwalde (a part of today's Eggesin) and Viereck formed the first new post-Reformation Catholic congregations in Pomerania. The Catholic Northern Missions took care of Catholic Pomeranians. Between 1709 and 1780 then Brandenburgian Pomerania was part of the "Vicariate Apostolic for Upper and Lower Saxony", before this merged into the Vicariate Apostolic of the North, then also comprising other Lutheran states.
The affairs of the Roman Catholic Church in the Kingdom of Prussia had been reorganised by the Bull "De salute animarum", issued in 1821. By that time there were six new Catholic congregations in the Prussian Province of Pomerania, besides the above mentioned three also one in Demmin, Stettin (est. 1809), and Stralsund (est. 1785). In the eastern, rather newer parts of the province, in the districts of Bütow and Lauenburg (Pommern), which had not been part of the Duchy of Pomerania during the Reformation, the Catholic faith had survived. These districts, however, belonged to the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Culm (until 1922). In 1821 the rest of Pomerania was disentangled from the "Vicariate Apostolic of the North" and subordinated to a new jurisdiction of the Diocese of Breslau. This jurisdiction was titled the Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania (, ), since Emanuel von Schimonsky was invested to Breslau's see under the new honorary rank of prince-bishop in 1824. The delegate resided in Berlin and served in personal union as provost of then St. Hedwig's Church.
Breslau's Prince-Bishop Heinrich Förster (1853–81) gave generous aid to the founding of churches, monastic institutions, and schools, especially in the diaspora regions. Pope Leo XIII appointed as his successor Robert Herzog (1882–86), till then "Prince-Episcopal Delegate for Brandenburg and Pomerania".
According to the "Prussian Concordat" of 1929 Pope Pius XI elevated the "Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania" to the Diocese of Berlin on August 13, 1930, becoming a suffragan of the Diocese of Breslau simultaneously elevated to archdiocese. So all of Pomerania became part of the "Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province", with Bütow and Lauenburg being part of the new "Territorial Prelature of Schneidemühl" ().
Infrastructure.
In the 19th century, the first overland routes ("Chaussee") and railways were introduced in Pomerania. In 1848, 126.8 Prussian miles of new streets had been built. On October 12, 1840, construction of the Berlin–Stettin railway began, which was finished on August 15, 1843. Other railways followed: Stettin-Köslin (1859), Angermünde-Stralsund and Züssow-Wolgast (1863), Stettin- Stolp (1869), and a connection with Danzig (1870).
In rural areas, many narrow-gauge railways were built for faster transport of crops. The first gas, water, and power plants were built. Streets and canalisation of the towns were modernized.
The construction of narrow-gauge railways was enhanced by a special decree of July 28, 1892, implementing Prussian financial aid programs. In 1900, the total of narrow-gauge railways had passed the 1,000 kilometer threshold.
From 1910 to 1912, most of the province was supplied with electricity as the main lines were built. Plants were built since 1898.
The Swine and lower Oder rivers, the major water route to Stettin, were deepened to 5 meters and shortened by a canal (Kaiserfahrt) in 1862. In Stettin, heavy industry was settled, making it the only industrial center of the province.
Stettin was connected to Berlin by the Berlin-Stettin waterway in 1914 after eight years of construction. The other traditional waterways and ports of the province however declined. Exceptions were only the port of Swinemünde, which was used by the navy, the port of Stolpmünde, from which parts of the Farther Pomeranian export was shipped, and the port of Sassnitz, built in 1895 for railway ferries to Scandinavia.
With the infrastructural improvements, mass tourism to the Baltic coast started. The tourist resort ("Ostseebad") Binz had 80 visitors in 1870, 10,000 in 1900, and 22,000 in 1910. The same phenomenon occurred in other tourist resorts.
Agricultural reform.
Already in 1807, Prussia issued a decree ("Steinsches Oktoberedikt") abolishing serfdom. Hardenberg issued a decree on September 14, 1811, defining the terms by which serfs were to be released ("Hardenbergsches Regulierungsedikt"). This could either be done by monetary payment or by letting soil to the former lord. These reforms were applied during the early years of the province's existence. The so-called "regulation" was applied to 10,744 peasants until 1838, who paid their former lords 724,954 Taler and handed over 255,952 hectares of farmland to bail themselves out.
Tumults arose in 1847 in the towns of Stettin and Köslin due to food shortages, as a result, prices for some foods were fixed.
On March 2, 1850, a law was passed settling the conditions on which peasants and farmers could capitalize their property rights and feudal service duties, and thus get a long-term credit (41 to 56 years to pay back). This law made way for the establishment of "Rentenbank" credit houses and "Rentengut" farms. Subsequently, the previous rural structure changed dramatically as farmers, who used this credit to bail out their feudal duties, were now able to self determine how to use their land (so-called "regulated" peasants and farmers, "regulierte Bauern"). This was not possible before, when the jurisdiction had sanctioned the use of farmland and feudal services according not to property rights, but to social status within rural communities and estates.
From 1891 to 1910, 4,731 "Rentengut" farms were set up, most (2,690) with a size of 10 to 25 hectar.
Bismarck era administrative reforms.
Otto von Bismarck inherited from his father the Farther Pomeranian estates Külz, Jarchelin and Kniephof. Aiming at a farming career, he studied agriculture at the academy in Greifswald-Eldena. From 1867 to 1874, he bought and expanded the Varzin estates.
In 1869, Friedrich Albrecht Graf zu Eulenburg drafted a county reform ("Kreisreform") that was promoted by Bismarck. The reform passed the House of Lords on December 7, 1872. Most important, the reform cut the linkage between noble status and the right to vote, the latter now depended on property (one had to be above a certain tax threshold) and not on status, aiming against the overrepresentation of the knights compared to burghers.
On June 29, 1875, a new constitution for the province was passed ("Provinzialordnung"), which entered into force in 1876. It redefined the responsibilities of the provincial administration (headed by the Oberpräsident) and the self-administrative institutions ("Provinzialverband", comprising the provincial parliament ("Provinziallandtag"), a "Landeshauptmann" (head) and a "Landesausschuß" (commission)). The Provinzialverband was financed directly from the Prussian state budget. The Landtag was responsible for streets, welfare, education, and culture. Landownership was not a criterion to become elected anymore. The provincial Landtag (Provinziallandtag) was elected by the county representative assemblies ("Kreistag" for counties, "Stadtverordnetenversammlung" for town districts) for a six years' term. A subordinate Kommunallandtag only existed for Regierungsbezirk Stralsund, until it was abolished in 1881.
In 1891, a county reform was passed, allowing more communal self-government. Municipalities hence elected a "Gemeindevorstand" (head) and a "Gemeindevertretung" (communal parliament). Gutsbezirk districts, i.e. estates not included in counties, could be merged or dissolved.
Effect of Treaty of Versailles on territorial size.
In contrast to the provinces of West Prussia and East Prussia, the Peace Treaty of Versailles of 1919 had comparatively little influence on the territorial size of the province of Pomerania. In the framework of the treaty some parts of the eastern rural administrative districts of Landkreis Bütow, Landkreis Lauenburg and Landkreis Stolp, amounting to altogether 9,64 km², where in 1910 a population of 224 inhabitants had been counted, went lost to Poland.
Administrative subdivisions.
Until 1932, the province was subdivided into the government regions (Regierungsbezirk) Köslin (Eastern part, "Farther Pomerania"), Stettin (Southwestern part, Old Western Pomerania or "Altvorpommern"), and Stralsund (Northwestern part, New Western Pomerania or "Neuvorpommern"). The Stralsund region was merged into the Stettin region in 1932. The provincial capital was Stettin ("now Szczecin"), the "Regierungsbezirk" capitals were Köslin ("now Koszalin"), Stettin, and Stralsund, respectively.
Province of West Prussia.
From 1807–1813 during the Napoleonic Wars, southern parts of West Prussia were added to the Duchy of Warsaw, a Napoleonic client state. In 1815 the province, restored to the Kingdom of Prussia, was administratively subdivided into the "Regierungsbezirke" Danzig and Marienwerder. From 1829–1878 West Prussia was combined with East Prussia to form the Province of Prussia, after which they were reestablished as separate provinces. The region became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany.
World War I and aftermath.
As a result of the Versailles Peace Treaty (1919) after World War I, Pomerania was divided between Poland and Germany. Most of the German-Prussian province of West Prussia fell to Poland as the so-called Polish Corridor, and constituted the Pomeranian Voivodeship (województwo pomorskie) with the capital at Toruń (Thorn). The western remainder were merged into Posen-West Prussia in 1922, while the eastern remainder became part of Regierungsbezirk West Prussia within East Prussia. The Danzig (Gdansk) area was made the Free City of Danzig.
Polish Corridor.
In the course of the reestablishment of the previously partitioned Polish state as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, the Polish corridor" was established from 70% of the dissolved former province of West Prussia, comprising Pomerelian areas and the Chelmno (Kulmer) Land. It cut Germany off from her province of East Prussia while at the same time it allowedinterwar Poland access to the Baltic Sea. Within Poland the corridor mostly constituted the Pomeranian Voivodeship ("województwo pomorskie"). The term was first used by Polish politicians and came into international use.
After the seaport workers of the Free City of Danzig harbour went on strike throughout the Polish-Soviet War the Polish Government decided to build a new seaport at Gdynia (Gdingen) in the territory of the Corridor. A large part of the German population of the Polish Corridor left the area after its cession to the Second Polish Republic in June 1919. Poland took over complete control on January 20, 1920. Those people who wanted to stay in their hometowns had to take Polish citizenship, as Poland refused to accept German citizens living in its territory. Former public officials were not accepted as Polish citizens and had to leave the area. Other people, declining to give up German citizenship, had also to leave the Corridor. Due to the reduced population German schools were closed and property of former Germans residents was confiscated.
Throughout the East Prussian plebiscite in July 1920 Polish authorities tried to prevent traffic through the Corridor, interrupting any postal, telegraphic and telephonic communication. On March 10, 1920, the British representative on the Marienwerder Plebiscite Commission, H.D. Beaumont, wrote of numerous continuing difficulties being made by Polish officials and added "as a result, the ill-will between Polish and German nationalities and the irritation due to Polish intolerance towards the German inhabitants in the Corridor (now under their rule), far worse than any former German intolerance of the Poles, are growing to such an extent that it is impossible to believe the present settlement (borders) can have any chance of being permanent... It can confidently be asserted that not even the most attractive economic advantages would induce any German to vote Polish. If the frontier is unsatisfactory now, it will be far more so when it has to be drawn on this side (of the river) with no natural line to follow, cutting off Germany from the river bank and within a mile or so of Marienwerder, which is certain to vote German. I know of no similar frontier created by any treaty."
Due to these difficulties, ongoing after the East Prussian Plebiscite ended with a significant German success, the German Ministry for Transport established the "Seedienst Ostpreußen" ("Sea Service East Prussia") in 1922 to provide a ferry connection to the German exclave of East Prussia, independent of transit through Polish territory.
Land reform.
In 1925, the Polish government enacted a land reform program intended to redistribute land from large landowners to small farmers. Because German landowners generally owned the biggest tracts of land, they were the first to be affected. The Polish voivode, Wiktor Lamot, stressed that "the part of Pomorze through which the so-called Corridor runs must be cleansed of larger German holdings." Because the German landholders who had remained in the Polish part of Pomerania resented their loss of status and the privileged position they had enjoyed before the land reform, they then became nationalistic and anti-Polish in their outlook.
Ethnic composition.
Most of the area was inhabited by Poles, Germans, and Kashubians. Since 1886, a Settlement Commission was set up by Prussia to enforce German settlement while at the same time Germans migrated west during the Ostflucht. In 1910 42,5% of the population was German (421,029 Germans) including German soldiers stationed in the area and public officials sent to admnistrate the area. In 1921 Germans counted 18,8% (175,771). Over the next decade, the German population decreased by another 70,000 to a share of 9,6%. Also, there was a Jewish minority. in 1905, Kashubians numbered about 72,500.
Exodus of the German population.
The Versailles treaty had stipulated that Germans in the part of German Reich territory to be ceded to Poland, the Polish Corridor, had until 1922 to make the choice for Polish or German citizenship.
The book, "Orphans of Versailles", states that as result of disloyalty of German citizens, who openly expressed their joy at Polish defeats in Polish-Soviet war, "Other places witnessed violent demonstrations against the minority; in Chełmno/Culm, the Starost reportedly encouraged Poles, 'If a German or Jew dares to say anything against the Polish State, tie him up and drag him through the streets to the starost's office or to the court.' Although the Versailles Treaty gave Germans until January 1922 to make their choice for Polish or German citizenship, many were compelled to declare right away, either for Germany (and expulsion) or for Poland and induction into the Polish army." In one village, four Germans were killed in mob violence and numerous others arrested on basis of denunciations by Polish neighbors.
In addition, the area was abandoned by numerous Germans (a number estimated at 10% of Germans) who were public officials and other workers with no ties to the province or military personnel (German garrisons were included in Prussian censuses as part of population).
Free City of Danzig.
The Free City of Danzig included the major city of Danzig (Gdańsk) as well as Zoppot (Sopot), Tiegenhof (Nowy Dwór Gdański), Neuteich (Nowy Staw) and some 252 villages and 63 hamlets. Covering a total area of 1,966 square kilometers (754 sq mi), the territory was roughly twice the size of the Napoleonic statelet.
Polish rights declared by Treaty of Versailles.
The Free City was to be represented abroad by Poland and forced to be in a customs union with it. The German railway line that connected the Free City with newly created Poland was to be administered by Poland. Similarly, the Westerplatte (until then a city beach), was also given to Poland, which created a military post within the city's harbour. There was also a separate Polish post-office established besides the existing municipal one.
League of Nations High Commissioners.
Unlike mandated territories, which were entrusted to member countries, Danzig like the Territory of the Saar Basin remained under the authority of the League of Nations itself, with representatives of various countries taking on the role of High Commissioner:
Population.
The Free City had a population of 357,000 (1919), 95% of whom were German-speakers, with the rest mainly speaking either Kashubian or Polish.
The Treaty of Versailles, which had severed Danzig and surrounding villages from Germany, now required that the newly formed state had its own citizenship, based on residency. German inhabitants lost their German nationality with the creation of the Free City, but were given the right within the first two years of the state's existence to re-obtain it; however, if they did so they were required to leave their property and make their residence outside of the Free State of Danzig area in the remaining part of Germany.
It became clear almost at once that the overwhelming German majority population of the Free State resented the concessions which had been made to Poland and their dismemberment from Germany. Professor Burckhardt, the League of Nations' High Commissioner in Danzig found, by 1939, his position as absolute arbiter in the endless disputes almost untenable.
Province of Pomerania.
During the First World War, no battles took place in the province.
Nevertheless, the war had an impact on society, economy, and administration. During the war, the provincial administrative institutions were subordinate to the military and headed by military officials. Mobilization resulted in work force shortage affecting all non-war-related industry, construction, and agriculture. Women, minors and POWs partially replaced the drafted men. Import and fishing declined when the ports were blocked. With the war going on, food shortages occurred, especially in the winter of 1916/17. Also coal, gas, and electricity were at times unavailable.
When the Treaty of Versailles entered into force on January 10, 1920, the province's eastern frontier became the border to the newly created Second Polish Republic, comprising most of Pomerelia in the so-called Polish Corridor. Minor border adjustments followed, where 9,5 km2 of the province became Polish and 74 km2 of former West Prussia (parts of the former counties of Neustadt in Westpreußen and Karthaus) were merged into the province.
Province of the Free State of Prussia.
After the Kaiser was forced to resign, the province became part of the Free State of Prussia within the Weimar Republic.
German Revolution of 1918–1919.
During the German Revolution of 1918–1919, revolutionary councils of soldiers and workers took over the Pomeranian towns (Stralsund on November 9, Stettin, Greifswald, Pasewalk, Stargard, and Swinemünde on November 10, Barth, Bütow, Neustettin, Köslin, and Stolp on November 11). On January 5, 1919, "Workers' and Soldiers' Councils" ("Arbeiter- und Soldatenräte") were in charge of most of the province (231 towns and rural municipalities). The revolution was peaceful, no riots are reported. The councils were led by Social Democrats, who cooperated with the provincial administration. Of the 21 Landrat officials, only five were replaced, while of the three heads of the government regions ("Regierungspräsident") two were replaced (in Stralsund and Köslin) in 1919.
On November 12, 1918, a decree was issued allowing farmworkers' unions to negotiate with farmers (Junkers). The decree further regulated work time and wages for farmworkers.
On May 15, 1919, street fights and plunder occurred following Communist assemblies in Stettin. The revolt was put down by the military. In late August, strikes of farmworkers occurred in the counties of Neustettin and Belgard. The power of the councils however declined, only a few were left in the larger towns in 1920.
Counter-revolution.
Conservative and right-wing groups evolved in opposition to the revolutions achievements. Landowners formed the Pommerscher Landbund in February 1919, which by 1921 had 120,000 members and from the beginning was supplied with arms by the 2nd army corps in Stettin. Paramilitias ("Einwohnerwehr") formed throughout the spring of 1919.
Pommerscher Landbund units participated in the nationalist Kapp Putsch in Berlin, 1920.
Members of the "Iron Division" ("Eiserne Division"), a dissolved Freikorps in the Baltic, reorganized in Pomerania, where the Junkers hosted them on their estates as a private army.
Also, counter-revolutionary Pomeranians formed Freikorps participating in fights in the Ruhr area.
Constitution of 1920.
In 1920 (changed in 1921 and 1924), the Free State of Prussia adopted a democratic constitution for her provinces. The constitution granted a number of civil rights to the Prussian population and enhanced the self-government of the provinces.
The provincial and county parliaments (Landtag and Kreistag) were hence elected directly by the population, including women, in free and secret votes.
The "Provinzialverband", which included all self-governmental institutions of the province such as the provincial parliament ("Provinziallandtag"), gained influence on the formerly Berlin-led provincial government: The Provinzialverband would hence elect the "Oberpräsident" (head of the administration) and appoint representatives for the Reichsrat assembly in Berlin. Furthermore, the Provinzialverband officials could hence self determine how to spend the money they received from Berlin.
Economy.
The border changes however caused a severe decline in the province's economy. Farther Pomerania was cut off Danzig by the corridor. Former markets and supplies in the now Polish territories became unavailable.
Farther Pomeranian farmers had sold their products primarily to the eastern provinces, that were now part of the Second Polish Republic. Due to high transport costs, the markets in the West were unavailable too. The farmers reacted by modernizing their equipment, improving the quality of their products, and applying new technical methods. As a consequence, more than half of the farmers were severely indebted in 1927. The government reacted with the Osthilfe program, and granted credits to favourable conditions.
Stettin particularly suffered from a post-war change in trade routes. Before the territorial changes, it had been on the export route from the Kattowitz industrial region in now Polish Upper Silesia. Poland changed this export route to a new inner-Polish railway connecting Kattowitz with the new-build port of Gdingen within the corridor.
As a counter-measure, Prussia invested in the Stettin port since 1923. While initially successful, a new economical recession led to the closure of one of Stettin's major shipyard, Vulcan-Werft, in 1927.
The province also reacted to the availability of new traffic vehicles. Roads were developed due to the upcoming cars and buses, four towns got electric street cars, and an international airport was built in Altdamm near Stettin.
The Pomeranian agriculture underwent a crisis. Programs were started to regain soil that had turned into swamps during the wartime, and even to establish new settlements by setting up settlement societies. The results were mixed. On the one hand, 130,858 hectare of farmland were settled with 8,734 new-build settlements until 1933. The settlers originated in Pomerania itself, Saxony and Thuringia, also refugees from the former Province of Posen settled in the province. On the other hand, people left the rural communities en masse and turned to Pomeranian and other urban centers (Landflucht). In 1925, 50.7% of the Pomeranians worked in agricultural professions, this percentage dropped to 38.2% in 1933.
With the economic recession, unemployment rates reached 12% in 1933, compared to an overall 19% in the empire.

Margarete Steffin

Margarete Emilie Charlotte Steffin (21 March 1908, Rummelsburg, now part of Berlin - 4 June 1941, Moscow) was a German actress and writer, one of Bertold Brecht's closest collaborators, as well as a prolific translator from Russian and Scandinavian languages.
Born to a proletarian family, at the age of fourteen she went to work for the phone company but her interest in Social Democratic politics got her fired. She worked in publishing and agitprop theatre, and became secretary of the party's Lehreverband (1930) and worked at the "Rote Revue". In 1931, she took a diction class from Brecht's wife Helene Weigel and became his lover. She was introduced to the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm, playing a maid in "Die Mutter" (1932). 
In 1933 Brecht and Weigel went into exile in Denmark. Though soon replaced as Brecht's lover by Ruth Berlau, Steffin entered an arranged marriage to a Danish citizen to stay as Brecht's secretary and followed the Brechts to Finland and Moscow when war broke out. She died from tuberculosis (diagnosed already in 1931) while awaiting an American visa. Brecht wrote six short poems on hearing of her death, eventually published together as "Nach dem Tod meiner Mitarbeiterin M. S." The second reads:
My general is fallen
My soldier is fallen
My pupil has left
My teacher has left
My nurse is gone
My nursling is gone.
Brecht's 1955 "Collected Works" names Steffin as the collaborator on "Roundheads and Peakheads", "Señora Carrar's Rifles" and "The Horatians and the Curiatians". In addition Brecht acknowledged her role in "Fear and Misery in the Third Reich", "Life of Galileo" and "Mother Courage". She is also thought to have had a large hand in "Mr Puntila and his Man Matti", "The Good Person of Szechwan", "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui", and "The Caucasian Chalk Circle".
Steffin also corresponded with Walter Benjamin and Arnold Zweig.

Durban Review Conference

The Durban Review Conference is the official name of the 2009 United Nations World Conference Against Racism (WCAR), also known as Durban II. The conference ran from Monday 20 April to Friday 24 April 2009, and took place at the United Nations Office in Geneva, Switzerland. The conference was called under the mandate of United Nations General Assembly resolution 61/149 (passed in 2006) with a mandate to review the implementation of the The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action from the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance which took place in Durban, South Africa. 
The conference was boycotted by Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, and the United States. The Czech Republic discontinued its attendance on the first day, and twenty-three other European Union countries sent low-level delegations. The western countries had expressed concerns that the conference would be used to promote anti-Semitism and laws against blasphemy perceived as contrary to the principles of free speech, and that the conference would not deal with discrimination against homosexuals. European countries also criticized the meeting for focusing on the West and ignoring problems of racism and intolerance in the developing world. 
Controversy surrounded the attendance of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the conference due to his past statements on Israel and the Holocaust. On the first day of the conference, Ahmadinejad, the only head of state to attend, made a speech condemning Israel as "totally racist" and accusing the West of using the Holocaust as a "pretext" for aggression against Palestinians. The distributed English version of the speech referred to the Holocaust as an "ambiguous and dubious question". When Ahmadinejad began to speak about Israel, all the European Union delegates left the conference room, while a number of the remaining delegates applauded the Iranian President. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed dismay at both the boycotts and the speech.
Durban III, a follow-up conference that took place on 22 September 2011 in New York, was boycotted by the ten aforementioned countries (including the Czech Republic), along with Austria, Bulgaria, France and the United Kingdom.

Boycotts.
Nine countries boycotted the conference entirely.
Boycott threats and limited participation.
Several countries sent only low level delegations that included no senior government officials. Some of these had originally considered boycotting the conference.
Ahmadinejad's participation.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was the only head of state to attend the conference and hence delivered a speech on its first day. European countries had expressed fears that a commotion in regard to Israel's right to exist and the Holocaust would be raised by Ahmadinejad and some of the other delegates attending the event.
A collection of human rights groups challenged the Iranian leader at the meet, charging that religious discrimination was widespread in Iran, notably affecting Baha'is, Christians, Jews, Sufis, Sunni Muslims, and other minorities, through arbitrary arrests, intimidation and harassment. The human rights groups called on governments taking part in the conference, as well as the media, to hold Ahmadinejad accountable for violations in Iran.
A meeting between Ahmadinejad and Swiss President Hans-Rudolph Merz before the conference created a minor diplomatic row between Switzerland and Israel. Jerusalem recalled its ambassador to Bern "for consultations" in protest at the meet, an Israeli Foreign Ministry official explaining: "We understand the Swiss are obliged to host the conference as part of their UN commitments, we understand that the Iranian President has to be given a visa. What we don't understand is why the Swiss President greeted Ahmadinejad on arrival." Speaking at a state ceremony marking the beginning of Holocaust Remembrance Day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed a question at the Swiss president, saying "I turn to you, the Swiss president, and ask you: How can you meet someone who denies the Holocaust and wishes for a new holocaust to occur?" In response, the Swiss foreign ministry released a statement saying it "deplores the excessive language used in this context by different Israeli representatives," and summoned the Israeli representative to Bern.
Speech.
In his opening speech, Ahmadinejad said that the Zionist creation of Israel in the British Mandate of Palestine was accomplished by "military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of Jewish suffering." He said that migrants from around the world descended on Palestine and set up "a totally racist government", and that "in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe, they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in Palestine."
The speech was disrupted at the start by members of the French Union of Jewish Students as Ahmadinejad opened with a Muslim prayer. The two rainbow-wigged protesters tossed red clown noses at Ahmadinejad and shouted "racist, racist" before being escorted from the room. The protesters said that they had been trying to convey "the masquerade that this conference represents." 
Within minutes of the speech's opening, dozens of delegates from at least thirty countries, including all the European Union countries in attendance, left the room to return when Ahmadinejad's speech was over. The Czech Republic announced that it would join the boycott of the conference in protest over the speech. The BBC described the exit as a "public relations disaster" for the United Nations. Many of those who remained to listen to Ahmadinejad's speech applauded his remarks. The countries whose delegates participated in the walkout were: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic (which left the conference for good), Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, St. Kitts and Nevis and the United Kingdom.
The English text version of the speech, handed out by the Iranian delegation, stated that after World War II the Allies had created the state of Israel "on the pretext of Jewish sufferings and the ambiguous and dubious question of holocaust." On the following day, the UN revealed that the Iranian president had originally intended to include the phrasing in his speech, rather than "the abuse of the question of the holocaust" he used. 
The speech was deplored by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Navi Pillay, High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the speech, but also objected to the walkout. European Union presidency said the remarks were "unacceptable" while European Jewish groups condemned the speech. Concern was also expressed that the speech would derail the conference or divert attention from its purposes.
Ahmadinejad received a hero's welcome upon his return to Tehran on 21 April, where he was greeted by supporters at the airport with "Death to Israel" slogans. The conservative media in Iran hailed Ahmadinejad's speech, while the reformist press focused on the walkout and demonstrations, but without criticizing the president. The speech was also supported by Lebanese militant group and government participant Hezbollah and by Gazan ruling group Hamas. On the day of Ahmadinejad's return, the Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned a European Union representative in Tehran to protest what Iran called the EU's "double standard" with regards to racism. On the following day, Iran sent a letter of protest to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for criticizing Ahmadinejad's speech, claiming the Iranian president "was subjected to unfair and unwarranted harsh criticism."

Other events and incidents.
Alternative summits.
On 19 April, the day before the opening of the UN conference, UN Watch and other non-governmental organizations hosted the "Geneva Summit for Human Rights, Tolerance and Democracy," in order to raise public awareness to the issues of discrimination and racially-motivated torture. Invited speakers included survivors of the genocide in Rwanda and former dissidents from Iran, Cuba and Burma. UN Watch also hosted a "Conference Against Racism, Discrimination, and Persecution" in Geneva. Speakers at the latter conference included former Canadian Justice Minister Irwin Cotler, French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy and former Miss Canada and President of Stop Child Executions Nazanin Afshin Jam. Other events in Geneva opposing the UN conference were attended by Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, Harvard law professor and liberal activist Alan Dershowitz, former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, and film star Jon Voight.
A "Durban II counter-conference" was held in New York on the same dates as the conference in Geneva. The counter-conference was sponsored by the American Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists and co-sponsored by more than 20 organizations. According to the organizers, the event was held to "address the real issues of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance which the Durban I and Durban II were officially convened to address; but as happened at Durban I, the Durban II proceedings in Geneva will likely ignore, distort, or misrepresent these issues."
Parallel summits.
Palestinian and anti-Israel NGOs held a parallel meeting to official events, entitled the "Israel Review Conference: 'United Against Apartheid, Colonialism and Occupation, Dignity & Justice for the Palestinian People,'" in a Geneva hotel on 19 April, before the Durban Review Conference had begun. The anti-Israel conference was organized by the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, the International Coordinating Network on Palestine and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Committee, and was attended by some 160 participants. A related initiative was the "NGO Civil Society Forum March against Racism," attended by Israeli Arab Member of Knesset Jamal Zahalka, who presented himself as a Palestinian victim of "Israeli racist apartheid," and by former UN Human Rights Council Rapporteur on Racism Doudou Diene. Yet another event was the "Civil Society Forum for the Durban Review Conference," in which Diene also spoke.
Statement by Libyan torture victim.
In a pre-summit planning meeting, Ashraf Ahmed El-Hojouj, a Palestinian doctor who had been tortured in Libyan prisons after being accused of deliberately infecting children with HIV, announced he was filing a legal complaint to the UN Human Rights Council. "The United Nations should condemn countries that scapegoat, falsely arrest, and torture vulnerable minorities," said Hojouj, who addressed Najjat Al-Hajjaji, the Libyan chairwoman of the proceedings. Hajjaji was reported to have been visibly uncomfortable during the proceedings and interrupted Hojouj three times during his testimony. She then gave Libya the floor to make an objection, and finally cut Hojouj off. Hojouj was slated to testify before the summit on 17 April.
Expulsions.
The UN expelled from the conference three activist groups for "unacceptable disruptive behavior." The Iranian Neda Institute for Political and Scientific Research was kicked out for distributing inflammatory material to meeting participants, while the Union of Jewish Students of France and the London-based group The Coexist Foundation were removed for disrupting Ahmadinejad's speech. In all, the credentials of 64 representatives from the three groups were revoked. Two journalists representing the conservative magazine and website Townhall were also expelled for disrupting the proceedings after one tried to take over the podium while the other filmed the scene.
Outcome document.
On 21 April, the second day of the conference, the delegates agreed on a 143-point declaration to combat racism and discrimination against minorities. The declaration also warned against stereotyping people because of their religion, a key demand of Islamic states who said that Muslims have been unfairly targeted since the 11 September attacks on the United States. In addition, the declaration reaffirmed principles agreed at the 2001 Durban Conference. The document did not include the concept that the defamation of religion is racist and should be banned.
Approval of the declaration was originally scheduled for 24 April. Delegates said that the controversial opening speech by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad strengthened their resolve to adopt the declaration as soon as possible, so they advanced the adoption to 21 April. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay described the declaration as an answer to Ahmadinejad's tirade. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner echoed Pillay's comment, saying, "The text was adopted, therefore he has failed."
Amos Wako, president of the meeting in Geneva, described the 16-page document as a "historic outcome." Navi Pillay called the declaration a "carefully balanced and yet meaningful" final document, which enshrined "a common aspiration to defy racism in all its manifestations and work to stamp it out wherever it may occur."

Ghazi II Saif ud-Din

Saif ud-Din Ghazi II (Arabic: سيف الدين غازي بن مودود; full name: Saif ad-Din Ghazi II Bin Mawdud Bin Imad ad-Din Atabeg Zengi; died 1180) was a Zangid emir of Mosul, the nephew of Nur ad-Din Zengi. 
He became emir of Mosul in 1170 after the death of his father Qutb ad-Din Mawdud. Saif had been chosen as successor under the advice of eunuch ’Abd al-Masish, who wanted to keep the effective rule in lieu of the young emir; the dishinerited son of Mawdud, Imad ad-Din Zengi II, fled to Aleppo at the court of Nur ad-Din. The latter, who was waiting for an excuse to annex Mosul, conquered Sinjar in September 1170 and besieged Mosul, which surrendered on 22 January 1171. After ousting al-Masish, he put Gümüshtekin, one of his officers, as governor, leaving Saif ud-Din nothing but the nominal title of emir. The latter also married the daughter of Nur ad-Din. 
At Nur ad-Din's death (May 1174), Gümüshtekin went to Damascus to take control of his son and entitled himself of atabeg of Aleppo. Saif ud-Din rejected his tutorage and restored his independence. The nobles of Damascus, worried by Gümüshtekin's increasing power, offered Saif ud-Din their city, but he could not intervene since he was busy in retaking Mosul. Thenceforth Damascus was given to Saladin.
and Saladin took control of Biladu-Sham (Syria), Saif ud-Din wanted to take over Aleppo, so he sent his brother Izz ad-Din Mas'ud at the head of an army to fight Saladin: they met in an area near Hama called Kron Hama (Arabic: قرون حماه), where Saif ud-Din was defeated. Later he prepared for another battle at Tell al-Sultan (Arabic: تل سلطان) near Aleppo, where he was also defeated; he want back to Mosul and send massengers to Saladin offering his alliance, which was accepted.
Saif ud-Din died from tuberculosis, and his brother Mas'ud I 'Izz ud-Din succeeded him in 1180.

Maria Albin Boniecki

Maria Albin Bończa-Boniecki (1908–1995) was a Polish artist. A survivor of the Nazi concentration camp Majdanek, he emigrated to the United States of America in 1957.
Biography.
Early life.
Boniecki's father, a Polish patriot, was deported to Siberia when Boniecki was five. Boniecki's mother chose to follow with her children. The circumstances following the Russian Revolution produced an opportunity for Boniecki, his mother and his siblings to slip away. With much difficulty they found a way to Poland, arriving in 1921.
Boniecki studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, and graduated in 1929. He produced many sculptures before the war, notably "Birth of Thought", presently held at the National Museum, Warsaw. He was awarded a permanent membership of Zachęta, the Polish Masters National Museum of Fine Arts.
World War II.
He was arrested by the Gestapo in October 1942 and imprisoned and interrogated at the infamous Pawiak prison. Thence he was sent to Majdanek concentration camp.
Despite being a subject of Nazi experiments and appalling conditions at the camp, Boniecki continued fashioning sculptures out of whatever he could find to encourage hope and endurance in his fellow prisoners, and in memory of those murdered. His heavily symbolic sculptures included:
When presented with an opportunity, Boniecki proposed a sculpture of three eagles to the camp officials, who accepted the offer, believing the eagles were a German symbol. But the Three Eagles Mausoleum that he produced symbolized, among other things, the freedom of Poland, brotherhood, and triumph. Some human ashes of the victims of the gas chambers were secretly placed within the sculpture.
The Three Eagles Mausoleum was destroyed after the war and a reconstruction was created in 1962 by Stanisław Strzyżyński, by order of the Polish government and against Boniecki's wishes. This reconstruction (see External links) remains on display at the Majdanek Museum.
At the same time, Boniecki was the chief of section V of Wachlarz, and gathered information within the camp for delegates of the Polish government-in-exile. Information was smuggled in and out of the camp routinely.
With the help of the Polish Home Army, Boniecki escaped in 1944 and, rather than fleeing the country, resumed his counterintelligence activities. He took part in the Warsaw Uprising and was again captured by the Nazis. He passed through the German prisoner-of-war camps at Lamsdorf, Gross Born, and finally Sandbostel, where he was liberated by British forces.
Post-war.
Boniecki settled in Paris where he met his wife Krystyna Boniecki (née Binental), also an artist. They continued sculpting and painting, and also developed educational toys for children, among them a tactile alphabet for the blind.
In 1957 the couple moved to Denver, USA, and became US citizens in 1964. Later they moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Knarsdale

 
Knarsdale, historically Knaresdale, is a village in Northumberland, England about north of Alston. The village takes its name from the Knarr Burn: Knarr means 'rugged rock'.
History.
The manor of Knarsdale was held in medieval times by the Swinburn family, and in 1313 Hugh de Swinburn was rector of Knarsdale. It was later held by the Wallis family, who sold it in 1730 to John Stephenson, a Newcastle merchant. One of the Stephenson family built Alston market cross. But in 1769 Knarsdale was sold to James Wallace, a distinguished lawyer. His son Thomas, for services to his country, was created Baron Wallace of Knarsdale. The family also owned Featherstone Castle, and Hodgson described Knarsdale Hall as having declined in importance — a gentleman's place of the 17th century now and for a long time since occupied by the farmer of the adjoining grounds... The garden walls have lost their trimness, the malt kilns and the brewhouse are gone. Today, however, the stone buildings on top of a high mound dominate the scene and are strongly built. The mullioned windows seem to have been inserted into an older hall.
Governance.
Knarsdale is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham.
Religious sites.
The church is dedicated to St. Jude, and Hodgson saw it in a ruinous condition, with stone lying about. It had been rebuilt in the seventeenth century, and old grave slabs were used in the building. In 1833, however, it was rebuilt at a cost of £300 and a new rectory was erected at this time. On the south wall of the church, beneath the sundial, is a stone carved with Erected 1833. Rev. Thomas Bewsher, Rector. William Parker and Joseph Richardson, Church Wardens. Enlarged 1882. Vestry and Porch added 1906. There is a fine collection of gravestones and one carried a strange inscription, which Hodgson called 'disgraceful doggerel'.
It was the epitaph of Robert Baxter, who died October 4, 1796. A man with whom he had a quarrel left a poisoned wrapped sandwich for him. The gravestone is now cut off.

Netherwitton

Netherwitton is a village in Northumberland, England about west of Morpeth.
A former cotton-mill now converted into residential housing, the old village school also converted into a house, an old bridge whence the pretty little church is visible, and a number of cottages and gardens comprise the village. The old cross, dated 1689, still stands in a garden beyond the green. Most of the common about it has been appropriated and planted with trees.
History.
During the Civil War, Cromwell quartered a large force in the grounds of the stately Netherwitton Hall for one night, and later awarded a sum of £95-5s-6d. as compensation for the damage done by his troops. After Culloden in 1746 Lord Lovat, a Jacobite leader, for a long while lay concealed in a "Priest's Hole" in an upper room of the Hall. Roger Thornton, a great merchant-prince of Newcastle at the beginning of the 15th century, was a native of Netherwitton and built a castle by the river, but no trace of it remains.
Landmarks.
The Devil's Causeway passes the village less than to the east. The causeway is a Roman road which starts at Port Gate on Hadrian's Wall, north of Corbridge, and extends northwards across Northumberland to the mouth of the River Tweed at Berwick-upon-Tweed.
Devils Causeway Tower, Netherwitton, also known as, or recorded in historical documents as Highbush Wood. King writes ‘Marked on some OS maps as tower but now considered to be remains of cottage.’ SMR still records as ‘site of tower’. Long records as ‘remains of an irregular shaped tower.’ This site has been described as a Pele Tower. The confidence that this site is a medieval fortification or palace is Questionable.
Netherwitton Hall is a Grade I listed building. There has been a house on the site since the 14th century. The present house, which was built in about 1685, to a design by architect Robert Trollope has an impressive three storey, seven bayed frontage with balustrade and unusual irregular window pediments. The rear presents some earlier features including a stairway tower which may contain remnants of ancient fortifications. The gardens contain a folly and masonry features.

Municipal Park (Luxembourg City)

The Municipal Park () is a public urban park in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg. The eastern edge flanks the "boulevard du Prince Henri" and, along with the valleys of the Alzette and Pétrusse, forms a boundary that separates the central Ville Haute quarter from the rest of the city.
This green arc is segmented into separate sections by the "avenue Monterey", the "avenue Émile Reuter", and the "avenue de la Porte-Neuve". The area bordered by these roads is approximately . The southern-most section of the park is called "Edmund Klein Park" (Parc Ed. Klein). The park was created after the demolition of the fortress under the 1867 Treaty of London.
The park is the location of the Villa Louvigny, in the southern-most section, and the Villa Vauban, across the "avenue Émile Reuter". The Villa Louvigny was the seat of the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion, the forerunner of RTL Group, and hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in 1962 and 1966. The Villa Vauban was the original seat of the European Court of Justice, and is now an art museum.
During the excavation for the construction of the underground Monterey car park, the remains of the fort was uncovered. Named the Lambert Redoubt, the pentagonal fortress can now be seen just south of "avenue Monterey". The Lambert Fortress was originally built in 1685, renovated in 1835-6, and razed between 1868 and 1874.

Frank P. Armstrong

Francis Patrick Armstrong (circa 1859–1923) was a steamboat captain in the East Kootenay region of British Columbia. He also operated steamboats on the Kootenay River in Montana and on the Stikine River in western British Columbia. Steam navigation in the Rocky Mountain Trench which runs through the East Kootenay region was closely linked to Armstrong's personality and career. In addition to being a steamboat captain, Armstrong was also a prospector, white-water boat pilot and guide in the Big Bend country of the Columbia River.
Early life.
Armstrong had been born in Sorel, Quebec about 1859. He moved to Winnipeg in 1881, and then came west working with a Canadian Pacific Railway surveying crew in the Columbia Valley from Cranbrook to Golden.
Character.
Lewis R. Freeman, a journalist, adventurer, movie-maker, and football coach, came to know Armstrong well in 1920 during a boat trip down the Columbia. Freeman described Armstrong, and as "one of the most picturesque personalities in the pioneering history of British Columbia":
Beginning of steam navigation.
In 1882 Armstrong homesteaded on the east side of Columbia Lake and planted potatoes, with the plan of selling them to the workers building the CPR downriver at Golden. He built two flat-bottomed boats, (called "bateaux") to transport his crop on the river. Armstrong decided a steamboat would be a good way to tow the bateaux back upstream. He arranged to have steam engines shipped west from a steam ferry built in 1840 that operated at his home town in Quebec. Once the engines arrived, and a boiler was could be located, Armstrong assembled a steamboat from miscellaneous planks and timbers that were lying around at an old sawmill. The result was the "Duchess", launched in 1886 at Golden. Two early passengers wrote that her appearance was "somewhat decrepit" and Armstrong himself later agreed that she was "a pretty crude steamboat."
Building the second "Duchess".
"Duchess" sank at least once, but Armstrong was eventually able to raise her from the river. He then applied the odd-shaped steamer to make enough money in 1887 to have an new sternwheeler built, also called "Duchess". Armstrong hired the veteran shipbuilder Alexander Watson, of Victoria, BC to build the new steamer, which although small, was well-designed and looked like a steamboat. Armstrong also had built a second steamer, "Marion", which although smaller than the second "Duchess", needed only six inches of water to run in. This was an advantage in the often shallow waters of the Columbia above Golden, where as Armstrong put it, "the river's bottom was often very close to the river's top".
The Baillie-Grohman Canal.
A curious feature of the Rocky Mountain Trench is that two of the major rivers that flow through it, the Columbia, flowing north, and the Kootenay flowing south, are separated by only about a mile of low marshy prairie at a place now known as Canal Flats. As the name implies, a shipping canal was built across Canal Flats by William Adolf Baillie-Grohman, a European adventurer and promoter from wealthy and privileged background. The canal was completed in 1889, but it was only used three times by steamboats, every time under the command of Captain Armstrong.
In 1893, Armstrong built "Gwendoline" at Hansen's Landing on the Kootenay River, and took the vessel through the canal north to the shipyard at Golden to complete her fitting out. By this time it appears that the canal had been damaged or deteriorated to the boat where at least some of the transit of "Gwendoline" had to be accomplished by pulling the vessel of the water, partially dismantling the boat, and pulling her along on rollers. Over the winter, Armstrong, it is reported, was able to prevail on the provincial government to expend funds to repair the canal. In late May 1894 Armstrong returned the completed "Gwendoline" back to the Kootenay River, this time transiting normally the rehabilitated canal.
The canal remained unused until 1902, when Armstrong brought "North Star" north from the Kootenay to the Columbia. The transit of "North Star" was only made possible by the destruction, by dynamite, of the lock at the canal.
Mining boom on the upper Kootenay River.
A mining boom along the upper Kootenay river in the early 1890s led to a demand for shipping to transport miners and supplies into, and ore out of, the region surrounding the river. The Great Northern Railway at Jennings, Montana was the nearest downriver railhead for upper Kootenay shipping. 
Armstrong moved south from the Columbia to the Kootenay, and built the small sternwheeler "Gwendoline" at Hansen's Landing, about north of the present community of Wasa. Instead of taking the ore south to the Jennings, Armstrong's plan was to move the ore north across Canal Flats and then down the Columbia to the CPR railhead at Golden. Armstrong took "Gwendoline" through the Baillie-Grohman Canal in the fall of 1893 (or rolled her across Canal Flats), fitted her out at Golden, and returned through the canal in the spring of 1894.
The difficulty of moving "Gwendoline" through the Canal convinced Armstrong that the only feasible route was south to Jennings. By early 1896, Armstrong joined with veteran Willamette River steamboat captain James D. Miller and built "Ruth" (named after Armstrong's daughter) at Libby, Montana. "Ruth" was the largest steamer yet to operate on the upper Kootenay River. Later, Armstrong and Miller associated with Wardner, and, when their competitors, DePuy and Jones suffered the misfortune of having their new vessel "Rustler" (125 tons) sunk after just six weeks of operation, the three men were able to dominate the river traffic.
Jennings Canyon.
Once in the United States, the Kootenay river, in its natural state before the construction of the Libby Dam, flowed through Jennings Canyon to the settlement of Jennings, Montana. Jennings has almost completely disappeared as a town, but it was near Libby, Montana. Above Jennings, the Kootenay River narrowed as it ran through Jennings Canyon, which was a significant hazard to any river navigation. A particularly dangerous stretch was known as the Elbow. Jennings Canyon was described by Professor Lyman as "a strip of water, foaming-white, downhill almost as on a steep roof, hardly wider than steamboat".
No insurance agent would write a policy for steamboats and cargo transiting the Jennings Canyon. Armstrong once persuaded an agent from San Francisco to consider making a quote on premiums. The agent decided to examine the route for himself, and went on board with Armstrong as the captain's boat shot through the canyon. At the end of the trip, the agent's quote for a policy was one-quarter of the value of the cargo. Faced with this quote, Armstrong decided to forgo insurance.
The huge profits to be made seemed to justify the risk. Combined the two steamers could earn $2,000 in gross receipts per day, a lot of money in 1897. By comparison, the sternwheeler "J.D. Farrell" (1897), cost $20,000 to build in 1897. In ten days of operation then, an entire steamboat could be paid for. Armstrong and Miller unsuccessfully tried to get the U.S. Government to finance clearing of some of the rocks and obstructions in Jennings Canyon. Without government help, they hired crews themselves to do the work over two winters, but the results were not of much value. 
Despite the work on the channel, every steamboat Armstrong ever took through Jennings Canyon was eventually wrecked in the canyon. The wreck "Gwendoline" and "Ruth" on May 7, 1897, resulted in the destruction of "Ruth" and the sinking of "Gwendoline", fortunately with no losses other than severe financial ones. When the new steamer "North Star" was launched a few weeks later, Armstrong was able to make up for some of the losses with 21 completed round trips on the Kootenay between Fort Steele and Jennings before low water forced him to tie up on September 3, 1897.
Move to the Stikene River.
In January 1898, Armstrong went north to Alaska to participate in the Klondike Gold Rush, with Armstrong deciding to try his chances at making money as a steamboat captain on the Stikine River then being promoted as the "All-Canadian" route to the Yukon River gold fields. On the Stikine River, Armstrong served with the famous steamboat captain John Irving. Together with A.F. Henderson, Armstrong built a steamboat, "Mono" for the Teslin Transportation Company of Victoria, BC. As might be expected from a vessel designed by Armstrong, "Mono" had excellent shallow water performance. When the Stikine river route collapsed as an alternate access to the Klondike in July 1898, "Mono" was taken under tow to St. Michael, Alaska for service on the Yukon River.
Return to the Columbia River.
"North Star" was sold back to Captain Armstrong when he returned from his Klondike adventure, and on June 4, 1902, he took her north to the Columbia River on his famous dynamite-aided transit of the decrepit Baillie-Grohman canal. With "North Star" gone, steamboating on the upper Kootenay ended for good. While Armstrong had been engaged in the Kootenay and the Klondike mining booms, a few competitors had appeared on the upper Columbia. In 1899, Harold E. Forster (d.1940) a wealthy mountain climber, businessman, politician and occasional steamboat captain, brought "Selkirk" by rail from Shuswap Lake to Golden, where he launched her but used her as a yacht and not, at least initially, as commercial vessel. Also, Captain Alexander Blakely bought the little sidewheeler "Pert" and operated her on the river.
In 1902 Armstrong dismantled "Duchess". Armstrong built a new steamer, "Ptarmigan", using the engines from "Duchess" which were by then were over 60 years old.
Service in the Great War.
Many men from British Columbia served in World War I which began in 1914. Steamboat men were no exception, even Armstrong although he could easily have stayed home because of his age. Instead, Armstrong supervised British river transport in the Middle East, on the Nile and Tigris rivers. The Tigris in particular was in a difficult and hard-fought theater of war. Armstrong was not the only one of the small community of steamboat men of Golden to serve. Armstrong's apprentice, John Blakely (1889–1963), the son of his former competitor, enlisted and went to Europe, where he became one of only six survivors when his ship was torpedoed in the English Channel.
End of steam navigation on the upper Columbia river.
The construction of railroads and the economic dislocations caused by the war had doomed steamboats as a method of transportation on the upper Columbia. With Armstrong in command, "Nowitka" made the last steamboat run on the upper Columbia in May 1920, pushing a barge-mounted pile-driver to build a bridge at Brisco, which when complete was too low to allow a steamboat to pass under it.
Last years and legacy.
Armstrong found employment with the Dominion government on his return from the war. He was seriously injured in an accident in Nelson, BC and died in an hospital in Vancouver, BC in January 1923. His own life had spanned the entire history of steam navigation in the Rocky Mountain Trench from 1886 to 1920. An older riverman who had known Captain Armstrong said of him: "With Armstrong those who could pay were expected and those who couldn't were never left behind".

William Henry Hance

William Henry Hance (circa 1952 – March 31, 1994) was a U.S. soldier who is believed to have murdered four women in and around military bases before his arrest in 1978. He was convicted of murdering three of them, and not brought to trial on the fourth. He was executed by the state of Georgia in the electric chair.
Investigation.
In 1978, Columbus, Georgia was undergoing a wave of murders of women. Several elderly white women had been killed by a perpetrator nicknamed the Stocking Strangler. In addition, the bodies of two young black prostitutes had been found outside of Fort Benning nearby. 
The disparate groups of victims were linked by a letter to the local police chief written on United States Army stationery. The handwritten note purported to be from a gang of seven white men who were holding a black woman hostage and would kill her if the Stocking Strangler were not apprehended. The Stocking Strangler was believed to be a black man, and this had been widely reported at the time. 
The seven white vigilantes wished to be known as the "Forces of Evil," and wanted the police chief to communicate with them via messages on radio or television. The first letter was followed by others; eventually, a ransom demand of $10,000 was also made to keep the alleged hostage, Gail Jackson, alive. (Jackson was also known as Brenda Gail Faison and other aliases.) The letters were followed by phone calls.
The letters and calls were a hoax intended to divert attention from the real killer. Gail Jackson, the supposed hostage, had been murdered five weeks before she was found, and before the first letter was sent. Her body was discovered in early April, 1978. She was 21 years old. Soon afterward, following instructions in yet another call from the "Forces of Evil," a second black woman's corpse was found at a rifle range at Fort Benning. Her name was Irene Thirkield. She was 32. 
FBI profiler Robert K. Ressler created a profile which asserted that the killer was one man, not seven; black, not white; single, not well-educated, and probably a low-ranking military man at the fort in his late twenties.
Using the profile and aware that both Jackson and Thirkield were prostitutes, Georgia Bureau of Investigation officers searched near the fort for bars which had generally black patrons. They were quickly able to identify William Hance and arrest him. He was a Specialist Four attached to an artillery unit at the fort as a truck driver. Hance had begun his military career as a Marine before joining the Army. 
When confronted with evidence including his handwriting, voice recordings, and shoe prints from the crime scenes, Hance confessed to killing both women and to the killing of a third woman at Fort Benning in September 1977. Karen Hickman, 24, was a white Army private known to date black soldiers and socialize in black pubs. Hance was not charged with Hickman's murder in the civilian system, but was tried, charged, and convicted by a court martial for her death.
Eventually, Hance was also identified as the killer of a young black woman at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana. Hance was not charged with this murder.
However, despite his four known femicides, he was innocent of the Stocking Strangler murders, eventually attributed to another black man, Carlton Gary.
Legal cases.
Hance's convictions resulted in several legal cases in three different court systems—courts martial, Georgia state courts, and the federal court system—of which these are a partial list. The flurry of last-minute attempts to secure a stay of execution are not included in this section. "See "Controversy" below."
Execution.
Hance was sentenced to death in civilian court for the murder of Gail Jackson and in military court for the death of Irene Thirkield. His military death sentence for Thirkield was overturned. His civilian death sentence for Jackson was not. He was executed by the state of Georgia on March 31, 1994, via the electric chair. He was the 231st inmate executed nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976 and the 18th in Georgia.
In the hours before his death, the Supreme Court voted, 6-3, not to consider his appeal. In dissent, Justice Harry Blackmun said that that even if he had not recently 
Hance had an IQ of 75-79 points, which classifies him as "borderline intellectual functioning" on modern medical scales of mental retardation.
Controversy.
Other issues besides Hance's mental and psychiatric status had created controversy prior to the day of his electrocution, and one—the question of racial bias in the state sentencing jury—veritably exploded afterwards. The Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles had not even proofread its order denying his stay of execution, and conflated it with another document about some other prisoner. The Georgia Supreme Court denied his appeal by only one vote, 4-3. 
One of his jurors at his second sentencing (after the first was reversed for prosecutorial misconduct), a white woman named Patricia Lemay, came forward to report that other jurors made racial remarks about Hance such as "just one more sorry nigger that no one would miss" and, if executed, he would be "one less nigger to breed."
There was only one black juror, a 26-year-old woman named Gayle Lewis Daniels. According to Lemay, Daniels was subjected to racial invective in the jury room. According to both Lemay and Daniels herself, Daniels refused to vote for the death penalty. The other jurors ignored her and reported to the judge that they were unanimous. When the jury was polled in the presence of the court, Daniels was by then too frightened to speak up. The other jurors had told her that she could be convicted of perjury if she continued to hold out, since she had testified, during jury selection, that she could vote for the death penalty.
The evidence of Lemay and Daniels outraged many press outlets. Said one newspaper afterwards, 
At a law school conference the following year, attorney Ronald J. Tabak stated at some length his opinion that Hance's race contributed to the sentence.

School Certificate (United Kingdom)

The School Certificate was a United Kingdom educational attainment standard qualification, established in 1918 by the Secondary Schools Examinations Council (SSEC). The School Certificate Examination was usually taken at age 16 and it was necessary to pass Mathematics, English and three other subjects in order to gain the certificate. The School Certificate was graded by the following: Pass, Credit and Distinction. To gain the School Certificate, the pupil was required to gain a minimum of six Passes and five Credits; anything less meant a Fail. If the pupil failed, then they would have to retake the School Certificate Examination. The School Certificate's layout is, essentially, similar to the BTEC Extended Diploma of today. Some pupils who did so then stayed on at school to take the Higher School Certificate at age 18. 
It was abolished in 1951 following the introduction of GCE O-Level examinations. The School Certificate also existed in a number of Commonwealth countries such as Australia and Singapore at various times.

Duvauchelle

Duvauchelle () is a small town situated at the head of Akaroa Harbour on Banks Peninsula in New Zealand. State Highway 75 passes through the town. The Onawe Peninsula separates Duvauchelle bay from Barry's Bay.
Duvauchelle is now part of Christchurch City Council jurisdiction since the city's amalgamation with Banks Peninsula District in 2006. From 1910 until 1989, Duvauchelle was the seat of the Akaroa County Council.
Statistics: New Zealand groups Duvauchelle in with other settlements fringing Akaroa Harbour, including French Farm, Wainui, Robinson's Bay and Takamatua. Together, they had a population of 735 at the 2006 census.
History.
The site of an ancient Māori pā or fortified settlement is at Oinako, where the Duvauchelle Hotel stands today. At Te Wharau creek, a taua or war party of Ngāti Awa warriors camped during the battles led by Te Rauparaha in 1831.
The name of the town and bay comes from the surname of two brothers, who held land there from the Nanto-Bordelaise Company, at the time of the French settlement at Akaroa in the 1840s. It is thought that the brothers never lived there. In the following decade, land alongside Duvauchelle Bay was leased from the Canterbury Association by British settlers, including William Augustus Gordon, who was the brother of Charles George Gordon, the famous soldier and colonial administrator, known as "Gordon of Khartoum" after his death. The first freeholds were bought in 1857; economic activity was focussed on timber extraction and sawing, mostly totara trees. Domestic pigs were grazed in the forest, who mingled with the feral pigs that were already present. As the tree cover was cleared, it was replaced with pasture. The first settler at the Head of the Bay, the location of the present town, was a Frenchman called Libeau, who arrived in 1841. Timber exploitation was also the main activity, as well as boat building. The sawn timber was all carried out of the bay by locally built vessels. A public house and a shop were built in the 1850s. A small building that served as both church and school was built by local people on a half-acre plot of land donated by Lord Lyttleton. The first permanent roads began to be constructed in the 1860s and 1879 saw the arrival of the County Council offices and the Post Office.
Both the devauchelle pub and the post office were both badly damaged by the earthquakes that struck the region in 2010 and 2011. The oldest parts of the pub were demolished after the earthquakes. The pub has not re-opened. The Post Office was demolished in late 2012.

Fortescue River

The Fortescue River is an ephemeral river in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is the third longest river in the state.
The river rises near Deadman Hill in the Ophthalmia Range about 30 km south of Newman. The river flows in a northerly direction parallel with the Great Northern Highway until it crosses the highway just south of the Marble Bar turn-off. The river then runs north-west then west crossing the Great Northern Highway again, north of the Auski Roadhouse. Approximately north of Newman, the river flows through the Fortescue Marsh, an important wetland. The river continues to head west crossing Highway 1 at the Fortescue Roadhouse () and discharges into the Indian Ocean at Mardie Station about 40 km south-west of Dampier
The river was named in 1861 during an expedition by the explorer and surveyor Francis Thomas Gregory, after Chichester Fortescue, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.
The traditional owners of the area that the river flows through are the "Indjibandi" peoples.
Tributaries.
The river is known to have 24 tributaries that include: Western Creek, Warrawanda Creek, Shovelanna Creek, Kalgan Creek, Fortescue River South, Cowcumba Creek, Macklin Creek and Tanga Tanga Creek.
During Cyclone Joan in 1975 many of these tributaries also flooded. Weeli Wolli Creek and Weelumurra Creek both overflowed and caused floods and washaways on the Hamersley Iron and Mount Newman railway lines.
The river flows through a number of permanent water pools on the latter part of its journey including; Tarda Pool, Mungowarra Pool, Crossing Pool and Deep Reach Pool.
Catchment.
The Fortescue Catchment area drains from the southern side of the Chichester Plateau and the northern side of the Hamersley Range making use of the trough between the two. The valley plains are composed of earthy clays with some cracking clays, loams and hard red soils.
Water is stored at Ophthalmia Dam which holds a total volume of 32,000ML, and a total of 6,290 ML/year are drawn from the surface water for use in the town of Newman.
Fortescue Marshes.
The catchment area at the headwaters of the river is particularly flat and marshy where the Western Creek, Warrawanda Creek and Fortescue River converge, the river then flow through a poorly defined channel as far as Gregory Gorge when the river starts to form a well defined channel and flows through a number of pools before reaching the estuarine area.
The 960 km2 Fortescue Marshes (} have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because, when the area is flooded it supports up to 270,000 waterbirds, including over 1% of the world populations of 14 species. The site is also the location for one of the only two records made since 1990 of the critically endangered Night Parrot.
Estuary.
The mouth of the river is a large estuarine area. The estuary is mostly unmodified, and functions primarily as a result of river energy. The delta formed by the river is tide dominated.
The estuary covers a total surface area of 
The majority of the estuarine area is made up of salt marsh and intertidal flats. A colony of mangroves use the estuary as habitat and occupy an area of . Large female Barramundi are known to inhabit the estuary.

Cercle Municipal

The Cercle Municipal or Cercle-Cité is a building in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg, It is located at the eastern end of the Place d'Armes, in the historic central Ville Haute quarter of the city.
History.
On a site where there had previously been a building intended as a "Cercle littéraire" but which finally housed a restaurant by the name of "Beim Gréitchen", the city decided to construct a grand administrative building. The design competition launched in 1902 was won in 1904 by Pierre and Paul Funck, a father and son team. The administration started to move into the neo-baroque building in 1909 but the official inauguration was in 1910. On the front, above the balcony, is a frieze depicting the granting of the city charter to Luxembourg City in 1244.
The building hosted the Court of Justice of the European Coal and Steel Community, which was established in Luxembourg in 1952, until 1969. It was used as the venue of public hearings of the court until a more permanent venue could be found, whilst other work was conducted at the Villa Vauban, in the Municipal Park.

Troy Tate

Troy Tate is a musician and record producer who was a member of several bands including The Teardrop Explodes and Fashion as well as working as a solo artist, for which he is best known for the single "Love Is ..."
Biography.
Born in Liverpool, England, Tate's first band was the Cheltenham-based punk rock band Index, who released one single, "Jet Lag" c/w "Total Bland" in 1978. He moved on to join former members of The Rezillos in the band Shake, recording two singles with this band. In 1981 he first recorded as a solo artist, releasing the "Thomas" single on the RCA label Why-Fi. He joined The Teardrop Explodes in late 1980, replacing Alan Gill on guitar, and playing on the "Wilder" album. While with the band, he continued his solo career, releasing "Lifeline" in 1982. He left The Teardrop Explodes, and joined Fashion in October 1982, leaving in 1983 when he signed to Rough Trade Records, for whom he debuted that year with "Love Is ...".
Tate moved on to Sire Records in 1984, who issued a remixed version of "Thomas", which was followed by his debut solo album, "Ticket To The Dark" the same year. The album featured contributions from former-Teardrop Explodes member David Balfe, Nicky Holland, Virginia Astley and Rolo McGinty of The Woodentops, and was described by "Trouser Press" as "an exceptionally good record". A second album, "Liberty", followed in 1985, which proved to be Tate's swansong.
The Smiths: The Troy Tate Sessions.
When The Smiths (also on Rough Trade) were looking for a producer for their debut album, Tate was chosen, although after the album was recorded, the band decided to reject these recordings and re-record the album with producer John Porter. The original version of the album is widely known as "The Troy Tate Sessions" and has only been released on bootlegs. "Jeane" from these sessions was released as the b-side of the "This Charming Man" single, and the version of "Pretty Girls Make Graves" was the b-side to "Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me". Tate's version of "Reel Around the Fountain" had been scheduled for release as a single in 1983, a disc of which was included in a collectors edition of "Complete" in 2011.

The Five Mysteries Program

The Five Mysteries Program was an audience participation radio series broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System from August 10, 1947 to March 27, 1950. In 1947-48 it aired on Sundays at 2pm.
Such mysteries were produced and syndicated (1945-48) to individual local radio stations as a "barter-trade" program to sell advertising to local merchants or trade the advertising announcements for goods, services or premiums, such as prizes awarded to listeners in radio station contests or promotions. To facilitate personalizing the shows to individual stations and insert the local ads, the producers put musical interludes in the shows with enough time for a local announcer to introduce the episode, present the advertiser's message and wrap things up with other local information.
Each 30-minute show featured five mini-mysteries dramatized with actors, organ music and sound effects. Solutions to each mystery were then suggested by a panel of listeners and studio guests. The panelists sometimes shared a common background; for example, on the April 14, 1949 program, the amateur sleuths were gas industry officials.
Cast members included Jackson Beck, Staats Cotsworth, Michael Fitzmaurice, Timmy Hyler, Abby Lewis, Frank Lovejoy and Ian MacAllister. Organist Rosa Rio provided the music.
While the premise was simple, the mysteries were well written, requiring some thought to come up with the right answer. Similar to the "Ellery Queen's Minute Mysteries", one listened to the story, evaluated the clues, and at the conclusion, matched wits with the sleuths to correctly identify the suspect. It was one of the few interactive radio shows.

Samuel Kamakau

Samuel Manaiākalani Kamakau (October 29, 1815 – September 5, 1876) was a Hawaiian historian and scholar. His work appeared in local newspapers and was later compiled into books, becoming an invaluable resource on the Hawaiian people, Hawaiian culture, and Hawaiian language during a time when they were disappearing.
Along with David Malo and John Papa Īī, Kamakau is considered one of Hawaii's greatest historians, and his contributions to the preservation of Hawaiian history have been honored throughout the state of Hawaii.
Life.
Kamakau was born in Mokulēia, Waialua on the North Shore of the island of Oahu. He traveled to the island of Maui and enrolled at Lahainaluna Seminary in 1833, where he became a student of Reverend Sheldon Dibble. Dibble instructed Kamakau and other students to collect and preserve information on the Hawaiian culture, language, and people. To further this goal, Kamakau helped form the first Hawaiian historical society in 1841. According to Kamakau: 
A society was started at Lahainaluna according to the desire of the teachers. As the people of Alebione (Albion) had their British history and read about the Saxons and William, so the Hawaiians should read their history...The King said he thought the history of all the islands should be preserved from first to last.
Kamakau married S. Hainakolo and moved to his wife's hometown of Kīpahulu. Their daughter, Kukelani Kaaapookalani, was born in December 1862, after which the couple moved to Oahu.
From 1866 to 1871, Kamakau wrote a series of newspaper articles about Hawaiian culture and history: "Ka Moolelo o Kamehameha I", a history of Kamehameha I; "Ka Moolelo o Nā Kamehameha", a history of the House of Kamehameha; and "Ka Moolelo Hawaii", a history of Hawaii. The articles were published in the Hawaiian language newspapers, "Ke Au Okoa" and "Ka Nūpepa Kūokoa".
During his life, Kamakau served as a district judge in Wailuku, Maui and was a legislator for the Hawaiian Kingdom. From 1851 to 1860 he represented Maui in the House of Representatives, and from 1870 to 1876 represented Oahu.
He died at his home in Honolulu on September 5, 1876, and was buried in the Maemae Chapel Cemetery in Nuuanu Valley.
Legacy.
On October 29, 1994, the Hawaii & Pacific Section in the Hawaii State Library was named the "Samuel Manaiakalani Kamakau Room" in honor of Kamakau's legacy as a "great Hawaiian historian who also served his community as an outstanding writer, scholar, jurist, and legislator." In 2000, a Hawaiian immersion school in Kaneohe, Oahu recognized Kamakau's contributions by naming their school Ke Kula o Samuel M. Kamakau. The Hawaii Book Publishers Association's annual Ka Palapala Pookela ("excellent manuscript") competition presents the Samuel M. Kamakau Award for the best Hawaii Book of the Year.
In 2005, the Hawaii State Legislature passed H.R. No. 55, declaring October 29, 2005 "Samuel Manaiakalani Kamakau Day":
WHEREAS, SAMUEL MANAIAKALANI KAMAKAU, born October 29th, 1815, in Mokuleia, Waialua, Oahu, has been noted by many as one of Hawaii's greatest historians of Hawaiian culture and heritage; and
WHEREAS, as a noted writer, SAMUEL MANAIAKALANI KAMAKAU authored books in Hawaiian that would later be translated by esteemed organizations such as the Bishop Museum and Kamehameha Schools, for future generations to learn from; and
WHEREAS, by his actions and through his passion for accurately recording native Hawaiian history, SAMUEL MANAIAKALANI KAMAKAU teaches our keiki, both Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian, what life was like as a Hawaiian, and thereby preserves for posterity, the legacy of a storied people; and
WHEREAS, along with maintaining a record of Hawaiian history, SAMUEL MANAIAKALANI KAMAKAU through his birth and affiliation with Waialua, solidifies Waialua's position as a stronghold for Hawaiian culture; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2005, that this body commemorates SAMUEL MANAIAKALANI KAMAKAU's contributions to memorializing Hawaiian history by proclaiming October 29, 2005, as SAMUEL MANAIAKALANI KAMAKAU Day.
Works.
In 1961, the Kamehameha Schools Press published Kamakau's first two series as a book entitled "Ruling Chiefs of Hawaii". Three years later, in 1964, the Bishop Museum Press published his last series as a trilogy, entitled "Ka Poe Kahiko: The People of Old", "The Works of the People of Old: Nā Hana A Ka Poe Kahiko", and "Tales and Traditions of the People of Old: Nā Moolelo A Ka Poe Kahiko".
A revised edition was published in 1991.

<doc id="20460837" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20460837" title="Siege of Kolberg (1807)">
Siege of Kolberg (1807)

The Siege of Kolberg (rarely also: "Siege of Colberg" or "Siege of Kołobrzeg") took place from March to 2 July 1807 during the War of the Fourth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. An army of the First French Empire and several foreign auxiliaries (including Polish insurgents) of France besieged the Prussian fortified town of Kolberg, the only remaining Prussian-held fortress in the Prussian province of Pomerania. The siege was not successful and was lifted upon the announcement of the peace of Tilsit.
After Prussia lost the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in late 1806, French troops marched north into Prussian Pomerania. Fortified Stettin (Szczecin) surrendered without battle, and the province became occupied by the French forces. Kolberg resisted, and the implementation of a French siege was delayed until March 1807 by the freikorps of Ferdinand von Schill operating around the fortress and capturing the assigned French commander of the siege, Victor-Perrin. During these months, the military commander of Kolberg, Lucadou, and the representative of the local populace, Nettelbeck, prepared the fortress's defensive structures.
The French forces commanded by Teuliè, composed primarily of troops from Italy, succeeded in encircling Kolberg by mid-March. Napoleon put the siege force under the command of Loison, Frederick William III entrusted Gneisenau with the defense. In early April, the siege forces were for a short time commanded by Mortier, who had marched a large force from besieged Swedish Stralsund to Kolberg but was ordered to return when Stralsund's defenders gained ground. Other reinforcements came from states of the Confederation of the Rhine (Kingdom of Württemberg, Saxon duchies and the Duchy of Nassau), the Kingdom of Holland, and France.
With the western surroundings of Kolberg flooded by the defenders, fighting concentrated on the eastern forefield of the fortress, where Wolfsberg sconce had been constructed on Lucadou's behalf. Aiding the defense from the nearby Baltic Sea were a British and a Swedish vessel. By late June, Napoleon massively reinforced the siege forces to bring about a decision. The siege force then also concentrated on taking the port north of the town. On 2 July, fighting ceased when Prussia had agreed on an unfavourable peace after her ally Russia suffered a decisive defeat at Friedland. Of the twenty Prussian fortresses, Kolberg was one of the few remaining in Prussian hands until the war's end. The battle became a myth in Prussia and was later used by Nazi propaganda efforts. While prior to World War II the city commemorated the defendants, it honoured the commander of the Polish troops after becoming Polish.
Prelude.
Within two weeks after the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt (14 October 1806), Napoleon's Grande Armée had pursued the defeated Royal Prussian Army to Pasewalk in Prussian Pomerania. The provincial capital Stettin (now Szczecin), one of twenty Prussian fortresses, capitulated on 29 October making Kolberg, which at that time had about 5,000 inhabitants, the province's only fortress remaining in Prussian hands. Pierre Thouvenout was appointed French governor of Pomerania and sent his envoy Mestram to accept Kolberg's expected capitulation and take control of it.
On 8 November 1806, Mestram met with the Prussian commander of Kolberg Louis Maurice de Lucadou (Ludwig Moritz von Lucadou) before its walls. Lucadou's refusal to hand over the fortress came as a surprise to the French generals and the Prussian administration in Stettin, who had already pledged allegiance to the French; it further led part of the defeated Prussian army to take refuge in Kolberg and reinforce the two musketeer battalions of the von Owstien and von Borcke regiments and the 72 guns garrisoned there. Lucadou ordered the Persante (Parseta) river west of Kolberg to be dammed up to flood the area around the fortress, and arranged the construction of Wolfsberg sconce east of the town. Coordination of these measures with Joachim Nettelbeck, representative of the Kolberg citizens, was however impaired by the latter's personal grievances against Lucadou.
Among the Prussian soldiers who had retreated to Kolberg after Jena and Auerstedt was secondelieutenant Ferdinand von Schill, who after his recovery from a severe head injury in the house of Kolberg senator Westphal was ordered to patrol the areas west of the fortress with a small cavalry unit. Supplied with information about French movements by local peasants, he succeeded in capturing a number of French officers and soldiers, gathering food and financial supplies in neighboring towns and villages, and recruiting volunteers to his unit from inside and outside Kolberg.
Schill's victory in the skirmish of Gülzow (7 December 1806), though insignificant from a military point of view, was widely noted as the first Prussian success against the French army - while Prussian king Frederick William III praised Schill as the "kind of man now valued by the fatherland", Napoleon referred to him as a "miserable kind of brigand". As a consequence of these successes and Schill's increasing fame, Prussian king Frederick William III ordered him to establish a freikorps on 12 January 1807, which in the following months defended the fortress against French attacks allowing its defenders to complete their preparations for the expected siege with Swedish and British support via the Baltic. 
Time for preparation was needed since Kolberg lacked sufficient defensive structures, manpower and armament to withstand a siege. The defensive works of the fortress had been neglected, only the port and Kirchhof sconce had been prepared for defense when Prussia feared war with Russia and Sweden in 1805 and 1806, but they had been disarmed in September. By early December 1806, the Kolberg garrison numbered 1,576 men, but increased steadily during the next months due to the arrival of Prussian troops and new recruits from nearby areas. Armament shortages were in part relieved by Charles XIII of Sweden, who sent rifle components from which local gunsmiths made 2,000 new rifles. As of late October 1806, a total of 72 guns were mounted on Kolberg's walls: 58 metal/iron cannons (8x 24 lb, 4x 20 lb, 40x 12 lb, 6x 6 lb), six iron howitzers (10 lb) and eight iron mortars (5x 50 lb, 3x 25 lb); in addition, there were four mobile 3-pounder cannons. While a convoy with artillery reinforcements was held up and captured by French forces near Stettin, twelve 12-pounder cannons reached Kolberg from the Prussian fortress of Danzig and the Swedish fortress of Stralsund, who each sent six guns. Since no further artillery reinforcements came in, the Kolberg garrison mounted an additional 92 guns on the walls which previously had been deemed unusable and withdrawn from service; these guns were positioned at the flanks at it was speculated that they might still serve to fire rocks and canister shots at short distances. Six guns captured by Schill's freikorps were also sent to Kolberg.
Claude Victor-Perrin, whom Napoleon Bonaparte had entrusted with taking Kolberg, was captured by Schill's forces in Arnswalde (12 January), detained in Kolberg and later exchanged against Prussian general Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher. With Victor-Perrin captured, the attack on Kolberg was to be led by Pietro (Pierre) Teulié's Italian division, who in February began the march on the fortress from Stettin. Schill's freikorps further delayed the French advance by provoking several skirmishes and battles, the largest of which took place near Naugard (Nowogard). Teulié reached the Kolberg area by early March, and by the mid of the month (14 March) had cleared the surrounding villages of Schill's forces and encircled the fortress.
Siege.
Mid-March to April.
When the French encirclement of Kolberg rendered Schill's strategy moot, Lucadou sent three cavalry units to aid the Krockow freikorps in the defense of Danzig, while Schill departed to aid in the defense of Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania. The suburbs, most notably Geldernerviertel, were burned down as it was customary.
Because of the delay in the French advance, Napoleon replaced Teulié as the commander of the siege forces with division general Louis Henri Loison; Frederick William III replaced Lucadou as the commander of the fortress with major August Neidhardt von Gneisenau after complaints by Nettelbeck and out of considerations for an envisioned British landfall at Kolberg - he feared that a French-born commander might irritate his British supporters, while on the other hand Gneisenau had been in British service during the American Revolutionary War.
In April, Napoleon withdrew the forces of Edouard Mortier from the siege of Stralsund and sent them to take Kolberg, however, Mortier soon had to return when the defenders of Stralsund pushed the remaining French troops out of Swedish Pomerania.
The French siege army was reinforced by troops from Württemberg and Saxon states (Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Hildburghausen and Saxe-Weimar) as well as a Polish regiment. The Saxon and Württemberg regiments were part of the army of the Confederation of the Rhine, which - like the Kingdom of Italy, whose troops were already present at the siege - was a French client. The Polish regiment, led by Antoni Paweł Sułkowski, with a strength of 1,200 had been transferred from the siege of Danzig (Gdańsk) on 11 April and arrived on 20 April; it was the 1st infantry regiment of the Poznań legion raised by Jan Henryk Dąbrowski on Napoleon's behalf), after a Polish uprising against Prussian occupation and French liberation of Prussian controlled Poland had resulted in the creation of a French client state in part of partitioned Poland.: "Shortly after his victories over Prussia, Napoleon invaded Prussian Poland. The emperor invited Dabrowski and Wybicki to appeal to the Polish people to revolt but made no commitment to support Polish independence. [...] Wybicki and Dabrowski called on their countrymen to rise up. Many Poles [...] supported the proclamation and welcomed the French. [...] An insurrection quickly liberated western Poland from Prussian rule. In early November 1806, Marshal Davout seized Poznan and soon Dabrowski entered the city. He ordered conscription and assembled an army of 30,000 men. On 2 January 1807, Napoleon triumphantly entered Warsaw. [...] Aware of the enormous power of the Polish nobility, Napoleon intended to acquire its support rather than rely solely on the masses. Indeed, rallying the Polish nobility around his rule was a major characteristic of the Napoleonic government in Poland. [...] For the time being, the Emperor delayed his decision on the establishment of a Polish state. He did set up a provisional government, however, to organize the war effort and run the Polish areas conquered from Prussia.": "3 After western Poland was liberated from Prussian rule in 1806, General Dombrowski was 4 recalled from Italian service and directed to establish the new Polish army. He began on 16 November 1806. On 29 November, Napoleon directed him to form eight regiments of infantry, each with two bataillons. Four were to be raised in Posen, four in Kalisz. [...] 6 The Posen (Dombrowski) legion. [...] Regiment[:] 1st[,] Colonel[:] A. Sulkowski[,] Major[:] S. Jakubowski"</ref>
May to June.
Throughout May and June, the siege was characterized by heavy fighting around Wolfsberg sconce east of Kolberg.
In early May, the siege forces numbered circa 8,000 troops. The siege force's blockade corps was since 4 May divided into four brigades:
The remaining forces, except for the grenadiers, were entrusted with the defense of other sconces in the vicinity of Kolberg. The headquarters of the siege force was in Tramm (now Stramnica), where also the grenadiers were concentrated. The artillery, under command of general Mossel, was concentrated near Zernin (now Czernin), and defended by a Saxon detachment stationed in Degow (now Dygowo). The construction of the siege works, was since 5 May supervised by brigade general Chambarlhiac of the 8th corps on Napoleon's behalf.
Schill returned to the town in early May, but left for Stralsund again after discord with Gneisenau, taking most of his freikorps with him (primarily the cavalry units). After Schill's departure, the defenders numbered about 6,000 men and consisted of
On 7 May, in a French reconnaissance attack, troops from the 1st Italian line infantry as well as the Polish, Württemberg and Saxon regiments assaulted Wolfsberg sconce. During the fight, a Polish unit repelled a charge from the cavalry squadron of Schill's Freikorps (113 troopers). General Loison in a report to Marshal Berthier on 8 May stated that the Poles had stopped a charge of 600 Prussian cavalry in that action. In another attack, launched during the night of 17/18 May, siege force troops managed to take part of Wolfsberg sconce, but had to retreat when in the resulting chaos, Württemberg troops shot at Italian units. The Prussian forces launched a counter-attack and drove them from the sconce once again. After this, the French general lost confidence in Wurttemberg troops and removed them from the battlefield. Polish troops were extensively used, and according to Louis Loison, showed exceptional determination in the attacks on Wolfsberg sconce.
On 20 May, an arms replenishment for the defenders arrived by sea from Great Britain, containing inter alia 10,000 rifles, 6,000 sabres and ammunition. Some of those supplies, including 6,000 rifles, were however redirected to the defenders of Stralsund.
On 30 May, Napoleon ordered the redeployment of Jean Boudet's division to enable it to reach Kolberg on demand within 36 hours, one regiment of the division was ordered to reinforce the siege forces.
Wolfsberg sconce, overrun by the French army on 17 May but recovered by the defenders the next day, capitulated on 11 June. Among others, Waldenfels was killed at the Wolfsberg sconce. Also, Teulié was lethally injured when a cannonball hit his leg - according to the French "Biographie universelle", he died five days later, on 12 May, and his death caused the parties to agree on a 24-hour truce in his honor; according to Höpfner's "History of the Prussian Army" however, Teuliè was hit when a 24-hour truce on 11/12 June was concluded after the capitulation of the Wolfsberg sconce, but not observed; and according to the Italian "Biografie di Pietro Teulie" however, the cannonball hit Teuliè after 13 June, and five to six days later, he died in Loison's arms in the nearby village of Tramm. 
Temporarily, the defenders were supported by the British corvette "Phyleria" and the Swedish frigate "af Chapmann", the latter had arrived on 29 April, was commanded by major Follin and armed with 46 guns (two 36-pounders, else 24-pounder cannons and carronades). Also, three fishing boats had been armed with guns and supported the defenders from the sea. A 3-pounder gun was mounted on each of these boats, which had been prepared by Nettelbeck; later, a fourth boat was similarly prepared by lieutenant Fabe. On 3 June during the evening the supporting ships directed artillery fire on the Polish camp, which proved to be ineffective due to strong winds, three hours later an armed expedition of estimated 200 Prussians attempted to land on the beach, and was repulsed in intense fighting by the Polish regiment
On 14 June, British artillery replenishments arrived for the defenders, including 30 iron cannons, 10 iron howitzers and ammunition. The guns replaced "the many unusable guns on Kolberg's walls". Since the fortress had experienced a shortage of light artillery while at the same time it had sufficient cannonball supplies in storage, a Kolberg smith had forged an operative iron 4-pounder gun; further efforts to forge artillery pieces in the fortress were rendered moot by the arrival of the British guns.
Final days.
In mid-June, the siege forces were reinforced by two Nassau bataillons with a strength of 1,500 to 1,600, Napoleon ordered the narrowing of the encirclement to cut off Kolberg from its port. By the end of June, Napoleon sent in battle-tried French regiments and heavy guns to bring about a decision: on 21 June arrived further artillery pieces and the 4th Dutch line infantry regiment (Anthing) with a strength of 1,600 to 1,700; on 30 June arrived the 3rd light, 56th line and 93rd line regiments of the Boudet division with a strength of 7,000. Overall, the strength of the siege force had risen to about 14,000 men in the final days. 
The French forces took the Maikuhle forest held by the remaining soldiers of Schill's freikorps on 1 July. Kolberg was heavily bombarded - of a total of 25,940 cannonballs fired by the siege force, 6,000 were fired on 1 and 2 July.
On 2 July at noon, fighting ceased upon the announcement of the Prusso-French agreement to the Peace of Tilsit.</ref> A Prusso-French truce had been signed already on 25 June following the decisive Russian defeat in the Battle of Friedland. Kolberg was one of the few Prussian fortresses which withstood Napoleon's forces until the peace was signed - others were Glatz (Kłodzko) and Graudenz (Grudziądz).
Casualties.
Based on data from the Prussian Military Archive, Höpfner lists the casualties for the Prussian garrison of Kolberg (saying it is uncertain whether they included the losses of the Schill freikorps) as follows:
Höpfner further reports that
Regarding the casualties of the siege force, Höpfner says that the Prussian archives reports list a total of 7,000 to 8,000 dead and wounded, 1,000 of whom were killed and injured during the last two days. Höpfner does not cite the number claimed by the French, which he dismissed as "worthless," and says that the beforementioned Prussian claim for the total siege force casualties might be exaggerated.
The casualty figures cited by Smith in "The Greenhill Napoleonic Wars Data Book" match Höpfner's numbers for the Prussian garrison, as they were used as a source; for the siege force casualties, Smith lists 102 officers and 5,000 men dead and wounded or died of sickness.
Aftermath.
After the announcement of the peace, Kolberg was not occupied by the French army. Already on 3/4 July, Napoleon ordered the bulk of the siege force to march west to Swedish Pomerania and reinforce, under command of Guillaume Brune, the French forces besieging Stralsund. The commander of the siege forces in Kolberg, Louis Henri Loison, likewise departed to the Stralsund pocket and was put in command of a division near Demmin. Ferdinand von Schill and Neidhardt von Gneisenau received the highest Prussian military decoration ""pour le mérite"" for their service. 
During the siege, Kolberg's suburbs had been levelled, more than half of the Old Town was damaged or destroyed by artillery fire, and Kolberg's economy with its two important branches sea trade and salt mining declined. A shortage of coins had led to the circulation of paper money, hand-written by students from the local lyceum on Gneisenau's behalf. The overall damage was at 155,000 reichstalers. Only in the mid-19th century began the reconstruction and modernization of the town and its port. The ruins of the destroyed medieval town hall were replaced by the current building, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Kolberg ceased to be a fortress in 1872 - by 1873, most of the defensive works were levelled.
In popular memory.
The siege itself became a myth in military history of Prussia, which was partially deflated in modern research by Hieronim Kroczyński.
Nobel laureate Paul Heyse described the events in his successful drama "Colberg" (1865). 
Before World War II, a monument in the town's center was dedicated to Gneisenau, Nettelbeck and Schill; Schill's house was marked with a memorial plaque, a redoubt and a street were named after him, and 2 July was a local holiday celebrated by an annual procession. After the war, when the town became Polish, a street in Kołobrzeg was named after Antoni Sułkowski, the commander of the Polish troops taking part in the siege.
Nazi propaganda movie.
Paul Heyse's drama was exploited in the Nazi propaganda movie Kolberg, which was begun in 1943 and released in 1945 near the end of World War II. At a cost of more than eight million marks, was the most expensive German film of the Second World War. Part of the plot did not match the events - for example, while the actual siege had ended because Prussia surrendered, in the movie it ended because the French generals concluded Kolberg could not be taken. 187,000 soldiers, 6000 sailors and 4000 horses were drawn from the front for the production of the movie.

Swami Adbhutananda

Swami Adbhutananda (died 1920), born Rakhturam, was a direct monastic disciple of Ramakrishna, a mystic of nineteenth century Bengal. He is familiarly known as Latu Maharaj among the followers of Ramakrishna. Swami Adbhutananda was the first monastic disciple to come to Ramakrishna. While most of Ramakrishna's direct disciples came from the Bengali intelligentsia, Adbhutananda's lack of formal education made him unique among Ramakrishna's direct disciples. He was a servant boy of a devotee of Ramakrishna, and he later became his monastic disciple. Though unlettered, Adbhutananda was considered as a monk with great spiritual insight by Ramakrishna's followers, and Swami Vivekananda regarded him as "the greatest miracle of Ramakrishna".
Biography.
Early life.
Adbhutananda was born in North-Eastern India in the Chhapra district of Bihar, around the middle of the nineteenth century. He was given the name Rakhturam, meaning "child who is protected by Lord Rama". His parents were poor, humble villagers. Both his father and mother died before Rakhturam was five years old and he was left in the care of an uncle who was affectionate towards him.
Growing up in the village, Rakhturam led a carefree life, tending cows and sheep in the fields. In later years he said, "I used to wander freely with the cowherd boys. How simple and guileless they were! You can't have real joy unless you are like that." Poverty forced Rakhturam and his uncle to travel to Calcutta in search of a livelihood. Rakhturam came in contact with Dr.Ramachandra Datta, a householder devotee of Ramakrishna, and he joined as his servant. As a servant, Rakhturam was considered energetic and faithful. Rakhturam became known as "Latu" in his new Calcutta surroundings, and he was called by that name thereafter.
Meetings with Ramakrishna.
Ramakrishna lived at the Dakshineswar Kāli Temple, a few miles north of Calcutta on the eastern bank of the Ganges. Ram Chandra Datta, Latu's employer, was one of the first householder disciples to visit Ramakrishna. Datta loved to speak about Ramakrishna and his sayings and Latu heard about Ramakrishna from him and was attracted by Ramakrishna's teachings, It is reported that inspired by the teachings of Ramakrishna, he was often found lying covered with his blanket, quietly wiping tears from his eyes thinking of God. Latu waited eagerly for an opportunity to meet Ramakrishna, and he met Ramakrishna on a Sunday in 1879 or 1880.
When Ramakrishna saw Latu, he reportedly said to Ramchandra that Latu had "holy signs in him." and it is reported that when Ramakrishna touched him, Latu entered an ecstatic state, "tears trickled from his eyes and his lips began to quiver with emotion" and he gradually returned to normal state of consciousness. Latu began to visit Ramakrishna regularly, and he lost the enthusiasm with which he worked before at Datta's house. In June 1881, he joined Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar as his personal attendant and helper. He also used to help Sarada Devi in her chores.
With Ramakrishna in Dakshineswar.
At Dakshineswar Latu began a life of rigorous spiritual discipline under Ramakrishna's guidance, and also continued his service as his servant to him. His day began first seeing Ramakrishna and saluting him. As Latu had received no formal schooling, Ramakrishna hoped that he might acquire at least a rudimentary education, so he tried to teach him the Bengali alphabets himself. However, Latu's Bihari accent was different from that of a Bengali and he could not read even the first vowel correctly. Ramakrishna corrected him repeatedly with much amusement, and the experiment was later discontinued. According to Swami Saradananda, Ramakrishna's monastic disciple Latu was seen "praying and meditating the whole night and sleeping during the day. His life was a literal example of the teaching of the "Gita":'In that which is night to all beings, the man of self-control is awake; and where all beings are awake, there is night for the sage who sees (2.69)."
At Shyampukur and Cossipore.
In the middle of 1885 Ramakrishna's throat became sore, which later developed into throat cancer. To conveniently treat him, the devotees moved Ramakrishna from Dakshineswar to Shyampukur, in North Calcutta. Latu, being his personal attendant went with him. He later moved on with Ramakrishna to Cossipore on 11 December 1885. He took care of nursing Ramakrishna during his final days, reminiscing about which Latu said, "Serving the Master was our worship. We didn't need any other spiritual disciplines." Before Ramakrishna's death, Latu even received an ochre cloth and rosary from Ramakrishna. After Ramakrishna's death on 16 August 1886, Latu went on a pilgrimage visiting Vrindaban, Varanasi, Ayodhya with Holy Mother Sarada Devi, and other lay and monastic disciples of Ramakrishna.
At Calcutta.
After Ramakrishna's passing away, Narendra (Swami Vivekananda) and some of the other disciples established the first Ramakrishna monastery at Baranagore in an old dilapidated house. Here some of the disciples including Naren took their monastic vows and were engaged in the study of the scriptures, practicing meditation and austerity. Latu joined them later in 1887 and accepted the monastic vows. Swami Vivekananda gave him the monastic name Swami Adbhutananda, meaning, "He who finds bliss in the wonderful nature of the Atman." According to his brother monks, Adbhutananda lead a very austere life at the monastery practicing meditation and "japa". He led the life of a wandering monk around Calcutta area, unattached to people and places. Sometimes he stayed at the home of other householder devotees, but most often was found living simply on the bank of the Ganges. Sometimes he stayed at Alambazar Math and Belur Math.
He also went on several pilgrimages to North India with his brother disciples including Swami Vivekananda. In 1903 he moved to the house of Balaram Bose, a householder devotee of Ramakrishna and stayed there till 1912. Here he was visited by people from different walks of life—judges, doctors, teachers, learned monks, and householders for spiritual instructions.
At Varanasi.
In October 1912 Adbhutananda left Balaram's hose for Varnasi, never to return again. Here he first stayed at Ramakrishna Advaita Ashrama and later at different locations. As was characteristic of him, he was so often absorbed in meditation that he rarely had fixed time for meals. In Varanasi he continued to teach and people visited him for spiritual instructions.
Last days.
During his last days, according to his devotees Adbhutananda seemed to be gradually withdrawing from the world. He spoke occasionally with people, and when he spoke it was generally of spiritual matters. As reported by this disciples, his body, which had once been remarkably strong, had been gradually weakened by age and years of intense spiritual disciplines and his indifference towards the physical world. During the last few years he suffered from diabetes and minor physical ailments. During the last year of his life he developed a blister on this leg, which developed into gangrene. He was visited by his brother disciples—Swami Turiyananda, Swami Saradananda. Eventually the gangrene worsened and the doctors operated several times on successive days, but were unsuccessful. Adbhutananda died in the holy city of Varnasi at 12:10 p.m on Saturday, 24 April 1920. Regarding his death, Swami Turiyananda wrote in a letter to Miss Josephine MacLeod, an American devotee of Vivekananda, "He showed no signs of pain during his illness. But the wonder of all wonders was that after this death when his body was placed in a sitting position to conform with some of the funeral rites, we found him looking so beautiful, so serene, so full of peace and bliss. His face beamed with light and an intelligence unspeakable, as if he were taking leave from his friends for the last time with an exhortation of affectionate benediction."
Teachings and sayings.
Swami Adbhutananda, being illiterate, did not write any books; his teachings and sayings have been recorded by this disciples and devotees. Adbhutananda taught that "the true being in man is ever free, ever pure, and remains ever untouched by good or evil. Good and evil have no absolute reality. They exist only so long as man identifies himself with the ego, the false self. When the ego is completely annihilated, man is freed from the false knowledge of duality or relativity--of good and evil." 
His other teachings were,

Hilton Glasgow hotel

Hilton Glasgow Hotel is a 20-storey high-rise hotel in Glasgow, Scotland. It is one of Glasgow's five-star hotels. It is located eight miles from Glasgow International Airport and three blocks away from Glasgow City Centre. The hotel can be seen in the Glasgow Skyline. It is located in Anderston close to the M8 Motorway. It officially opened on November 30, 1992.
Background and construction.
Construction of the current hotel began in 1990. It stands on a site within the Anderston Commercial Zone, an area cleared during the 1960s and designated by the then Glasgow Corporation for "comprehensive development". Originally the land was earmarked for the second phase of the Anderston Centre complex (early plans show that a public housing tower was planned for the spot where the hotel stands), however this was abandoned, and the site lay derelict until the late 1980s. 
As well as being Hilton's first foray into Glasgow (it later took over the prestigious Stakis Grosvenor in the city's West End, and a third hotel was added to the portfolio in Finnieston), the hotel was notable for being the first high rise building over 20 storeys to be constructed in Glasgow since its tower block building boom of the 1960s and early 1970s. The hotel has the largest banqueting hall in the city.
Famous Guests.
The hotel is notable for having accommodated many celebrities, including the former United States President Bill Clinton. The local actor and comedian Billy Connolly is also a regular guest, who was born a few streets away in the (now demolished) tenements of Anderston.
When American boxer Mike Tyson had a match at nearby Hampden Park, he booked 150 rooms for himself and his entourage. Hollywood actor Robert Duvall also stayed in one of the hotel's luxury suites for several weeks during filming of the movie "A Shot at Glory", which was shot in and around the city.

HMAS Vigilant

HMAS "Vigilant" (later known as HMAS "Sleuth" and HMAS "Hawk") was an auxiliary patrol boat serving with the Royal Australian Navy during the Second World War. Notably it was the 120th ship built by the Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the first aluminium ship built in Australia.
History.
PV "Vigilant" was a prototype ship designed and built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in 1937–38. The hull and wheelhouse were constructed entirely of aluminium to save weight. As a result, the ship had a total displacement of only 106 tons.
It was built for the Department of Trade and Customs, intended for use patrolling waters to the north of Australia in conjunction with the "Kuru". It was initially based at Townsville.
Naval service.
The ship was still undergoing sea trials when it was requisitioned by the Royal Australian Navy in October 1940, commissioning as HMAS "Vigilant" on 12 November1940. It was classed as an auxiliary patrol vessel. It was initially equipped with a 3 pounder QF gun but this was replaced with a 20 mm Oerlikon. As well as the mounted gun, it carried a variety of light arms including a Bren light machine gun.
"Vigilant" was transferred to Darwin, Northern Territory in 1941 and was used for protecting the harbour approaches. During the Bombing of Darwin, "Vigilant" engaged some of the attacking aircraft with its 20 mm Oerlikon and later assisted in picking up survivors from the water in Darwin Harbour.
"Vigilant", with a hold capacity of 7 tons, played an important role in the Battle of Timor from May 1942 and made several supply trips to the island. During one of these supply voyages, it assisted in the search for survivors from HMAS "Armidale". During this time, it also resupplied corvettes operating in the Timor Sea, notably resupplying HMAS "Deloraine" with depth charges.
HMAS "Vigilant" was renamed HMAS "Sleuth" on 17 April 1944 and HMAS "Hawk" on 13 March 1945. "Hawk" was paid off on 12 November 1945.
Post-war service.
After the war, the ship was returned to the Department of Trade and Customs as PV "Vigilant", and served as a whaling patrol ship off Western Australia until 1965. Despite attempts to save the ship for preservation, it was scuttled off Sydney in April 1966.
Legacy.
Vigilant Close in Bentley Park, Queensland is named after HMAS "Vigilant".
Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, the RAN decided that, in recognition of the vessel's wartime service, future ships named HMAS "Vigilant" would be entitled to carry the honours "Darwin 1942–43" and "Pacific 1942–43".

Right to Dream

"Right to Dream" is a song from the film "Tennessee". It was written by Mariah Carey and Willie Nelson, and released as a single in late 2008.
Background.
Deconstructing her songwriting process, Carey explains: "It was a different experience from an album project. I was very close to the story and in particular my character's struggle, so it made it easier for me as a writer. I just began channeling Krystal's pain and hope."
"The song is basically a three-act play and chronicles the evolution of Krystal," says Carey.
"I was humming different melodies while I was on the set and stuff," Carey says. "I was just thinking that Willie Nelson would be somebody fabulous to collaborate with. I reached out to him, and we met after one of his concerts."
The song, says Carey, is from the perspective of her "Tennessee" character Krystal, an aspiring singer. "The song has its own arc," Carey said. "She begins by telling us where she started, like she lays in bed and wonders where she left herself. A lot of people go through that sort of thing. It's kind of about empowerment."
Release.
The song went for adds at Adult Contemporary radio on October 20, 2008. The song has already been released on the Canadian iTunes Store. It was digitally released in the U.S. on December 2, 2008.
Critical reception.
When the "Los Angeles Times" named "Right to Dream" as a contender for the Academy Award for Best Original Song the paper described the song as "restrained elegance, with some light, finger-picked guitar flourishes and a dash of late-night soul." Forty-nine songs from eligible feature-length motion pictures contended for nominations in the Original Song category for the 81st Academy Awards. "Right to Dream" was on the list, but did not make the final nominations.
Music video.
A music video was shot and released to promote the single and the film. It premiered on December 8, 2008. The video features clips from the movie as well as shots of Carey in the studio recording the song.

Rosie!

Rosie! is a 1967 comedy film directed by David Lowell Rich, based on Ruth Gordon's play "A Very Rich Woman".
Plot.
Rosie Lord (Russell) is a widowed millionaire who, much to the dismay of her daughters Mildred (Meadows) and Edith (Brown), spends her money generously. When she announces to buy a $2.5 million closed theater in a run-down part of Los Angeles, because it's the location where her late husband proposed to her and it's now threatened to be turned into a parking lot, her daughters decide that they have had enough. Edith and her husband Cabot (Nielsen) complain that they are only granted $100.000 a year, and work together with cold-hearted and recently divorced Mildred to discourage Rosie from making the buy. They are unable to convince her and her legal advisor Oliver (Aherne) to let them take care of their money, and thus decide to try to declare her incompetent, thereby hoping to put her in an insane asylum. Edith and Cabot's young daughter Daphne (Dee) is appalled to overhear the scheme, and vows to help her grandmother.
Daphne rushes to Oliver's office, but runs into his much younger associate David Wheelwright (Farentino), who promises to help her after an emotional conversation. Oliver is upset to find out that one of his workers is taking matters in own hands, and meets with David to hear him out. David advises that they should put someone with Rosie to prevent her from doing anything outrageous, because their daughters are sending a private investigator to the case. Oliver takes his advice, but sends him on the job. David reluctantly starts the job, but is quickly drawn to Rosie's extraverted personality. Simultaneously, he goes on a few romantic dates with Daphne and they fall in love.
After attending a piano recital, Rosie is abducted by two men, and later awakes in a locked rest home for the mentally unstable in the Santa Monica Mountains. Rosie is heartbroken to learn that her daughters committed her to a sanitarium, and rejects an offer from Cabot to sign the papers for her release in exchange for making them responsible of her finances. He assures her that they can keep her in the sanitarium indefinitely if she does not obey their wishes, prompting Rosie to reconsider. Meanwhile, Daphne finds out what has happened, and furiously leaves the home, despite her mother's plea not to leave her.
With the help of Oliver and David, Daphne enters the rest home and breaks Rosie out. Rosie, who cannot believe what her own daughters did to her, is next sued in court. Mildred and Edith's lawyer puts Rosie's sanity at debate, and Rosie is ready to announce her defeat during the process. Daphne and Oliver console her during the trial, and when Oliver announces his love for her, Rosie decides to fight again. She faints in court and pretends to be dying, to get her daughters to admit that she is sane (in order for Rosie to change her will just before dying). The case is thereby dismissed and Rosie is now free to marry Oliver.

The Land of Heart's Desire

"The Land of Heart's Desire" is a play by Irish poet, dramatist, and 1923 Nobel laureate William Butler Yeats. First performed in the spring of 1894, at the Avenue Theatre in London, where it ran for a little over six weeks, it was the first professional performance of one of Yeats' plays.
In this theatrical lament on age and thwarted aspirations, a faery child encounters the newlyweds Shawn and Mary Bruin at their home, shared with Maurteen Bruin and Bridget Bruin, Shawn's parents. The child, who at first is thought of by the Bruins as of gentle birth, denounces God and shocks Father Hart. She expounds on the ephemeral nature of life, in a bid to entice the newly-wed Maire to leave with her to the world of faery:
<poem>
You shall go with me, newly-married bride,
And gaze upon a merrier multitude.
White-armed Nuala, Aengus of the Birds,
Feacra of the hurtling foam, and him
Who is the ruler of the Western Host,
Finvarra, and their Land of Heart's Desire,
Where beauty has no ebb, decay no flood,
But joy is wisdom, Time an endless song.
I kiss you and the world begins to fade.
</poem>
Shawn implores the previously listless Maire to remain in the real world, but she dies in his arms, surrendering herself to the laughter and eternal, youthful dance of the otherworld, and to the seductive draw of immortality and mindless joy.
Influence.
The title of the album "Like a Flame" by Frederik Magle is derived from a quote from "The Land of Heart's Desire".

Eikonoklastes

Eikonoklastes (from the Greek εἰκονοκλάστης "iconoclast") is a book by John Milton, published October 1649. In it he provides a justification for the execution of Charles I, which had taken place on 30 January 1649. The book's title is taken from the Greek, and means "Iconoclast" or "breaker of the icon", and refers to "Eikon Basilike", a Royalist propaganda work. The translation of "Eikon Basilike" is "icon of the King"; it was published immediately after the execution. Milton's book is therefore usually seen as Parliamentarian propaganda, explicitly designed to counter the Royalist arguments.
Background.
Milton was commissioned to write "Eikonoklastes" as a response to Charles I's supposed "Eikon Basilike" (1649). The tract was intended to be the official argument by the Commonwealth government.
"Eikon Basilike" was published just after Charles I's execution, and the work portrayed him as a martyr. The piece was written with straightforward political aims, to stir up popular sentiment in support of the former monarch and to undermine the control of the Commonwealth government. The work proved so popular that there were 35 editions produced that year. Milton's approach was different from that of "Eikon Basilike", which may have in fact been a composite work with John Gauden involved in ghostwriting: instead of appealing to popular sentiment, Milton's work was closely argued and tried to meet each of the points in the "Eikon".
Milton believed, certainly, that the "Eikon Basilike" created a false idol and he wanted to destroy it with truth. "Eikonoklastes", titled "Eikonolastes in Answer to a Book Intitl'd Eikon Basilike, The Portrature of his Sacred Majesty in his Solitudes and Sufferings", was issued in two versions in October 1649, in English, and was enlarged in 1650. It was quite soon translated into Latin and French. In 1651 a reply appeared, "Eikon Aklastos" ("the icon unbroken"). It was written by Joseph Jane, involved in royalist organisation.
Tract.
Milton begins his work by mentioning that he was commissioned to write "Eikonoklastes" and that he did such for the good of the Commonwealth: "I take it on me as a work assign'd rather, then by me cho'n or affected" The central argument of "Eikonoklastes" involves the tyranny inherent in all monarchies, and Milton attacks the idea put forth by Charles I that the liberty of individuals consists "in the enjoyment of the fruits of our industry, and the benefit of those Laws to which we our selves have consented". Milton's response is to point out how such a definition cannot actually separate different kinds of governments:
First, for in the injoyment of those fruits, which our industry and labours have made our own upon our own, what Privilege is that, above what the 'Turks", "Jewes", and "Mores" enjoy under the Turkish Monarchy? For without that kind of Justice, which is also in "Argiers", among Theevs and Pirates between themselvs, no kind of Government, no Societie, just or unjust could stand; no combination or conspiracy could stick together. We expect therfore something more, that must distinguish free Government from slavish
To Milton, Charles I was able to coerce the English people and actually made them his slaves, especially through his veto power which established him "as the transcendent and ultimat Law above all our Laws; and to rule us forcibly by Laws to which we ourselves did not consent".
Milton attacks Charles I's rhetorical flourishes throughout "Eikon Basilike", and he claims that "the whole Book might perhaps be intended a peece of Poetrie". Milton criticises every aspect of "Eikon Basilike" to the point that when Charles I claims that he was with gentlemen, Milton responds "Gentlemen indeed; the ragged Infantrie of Stewes and Brothels". However, the criticism was not limited to just style and images. In response that Charles I coining the term "demagogue", Milton claimed that the word as an attack on the English language and the English people and says, "the affrightment of this Goblin word; for the King by his leave cannot coine English as he could Money, to be current".
In the second edition, Milton expanded his claim that the supporters of Charles I were an "inconstant, irrational, and Image-doting rabble" to declare: 
that like a credulous and hapless herd, begott'n to servility, and inchanted with these popular institutes of Tyranny, subscrib'd with a new device of the Kings Picture at his praiers, hold out both thir eares with such delight and ravishment to be stigmatiz'd and board through in witness of thir own voluntary and beloved baseness.
Milton also altered an epigraph by Sallust on the title page that comes from Gaius Memmius's speech in "Bellum Iugurthinum". The speech penned by Sallust for Memmius describes various abuses, and is used to argue that all monarchs are corrupt.
In addition to a discussion of Charles I and monarchy, Milton added response to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, who wrote "The History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars".
Themes.
Milton argues that there is a potential in all monarchical governments for the potential of enslaving a population, which was an argument he previously relied on in his "The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates". Milton's view of freedom was not limited to just having the right to property, but to be free from the potential of arbitrary domination by a monarch. Monarchy was not the only subject of importance to Milton within "Eikonoklastes"; Milton also defended Calvinistic principles, and he claims that reformation cannot accept episcopal or monarchical control. Instead, a presbyterian based religion was the only proper type of religion. To John Shawcross, Milton's experience while writing the piece, along with the two "Defences" "supplied the experience with the world, that dark world and wide, that seems to have been needed for Milton to move beyond the defiant to degrees of understanding, if not acceptance, of humankind."
Starting in 1649, Milton began to connect his various prose publications with the plan of a future epic to be composed, and "Eikonoklastes" was one such work. As such, there are multiple parallels between the actions of Charles I monarchy and Satan's rule in hell found within "Paradise Lost". The description of a rise of an antichristian monarchs near the end of "Eikonoklastes" declares that such individuals rely on an ambiguous language to gain power. Likewise, Milton's Satan relies on the same kind of rhetoric. Likewise, the deviant followers of Charles I are connected to demons in hell who drink and blaspheme.
Critical review.
The work failed: it is the general view that Milton's work did not succeed, at least in terms of rebutting the "Eikon Basilike." On the other hand scholars still debate exactly what the polemic intention of Milton's work was. This book was the first work by Milton to be at all widely read. Public sentiment still supported Charles I, but the tract was able to appeal to a larger audience than many of Milton's previous works. 
After the English Restoration of 1660, Milton's readers primarily were vindictive, and " Eikonoklastes" had justified regicides. The Act of Oblivion was enacted on 29 August 1660, and Milton was not among those who were listed to suffer the death penalty for their part in Charles I's execution. On the other hand, a proclamation by the king demanded that "Eikonoklastes" and "Defensio pro Populo Anglicano" be burned. The works were soon after burned in public by the public hangman. This did not stop the work attracting readers, and there was a new edition in 1690 after the Glorious Revolution.

Halal-TV

Halal-tv is a Swedish television show, based on the Dutch show "De Meiden van Halal". The program is hosted by three young veiled Muslim women who portray the Swedish society from their perspective. It consisted of eight episodes and was broadcast on SVT2 in the fall of 2008.
The program sparked controversy before the first episode had been broadcast. For example, one of the hosts, Cherin Awad, had made a statement in the show "Existens" five years earlier which some interpreted as her condoning stoning because of sexual infidelity.
Another controversy surrounded the politician Carl B Hamilton who was interviewed in one episode. When meeting the hosts, he insisted on shaking their hands. Two of the hosts, did however refuse to shake Hamiltons hand, as they thought that violated their religious beliefs. This sparked a heated discussion between Hamilton and the hosts which was later published by SVT and spread on the Internet.

Walddeutsche

Walddeutsche (, meaning "Forest Germans" or "Taubdeutsche", meaning "Speechless Germans"; ; meaning "speechless people" (from Polish "głuchy" - deaf, i.e. "unable to communicate" or "głusz" from wood), sometimes simply called Polish Germans, the name for a group of people, mostly of German origin, who settled during the 14th-17th century on the territory of present-day Sanockie Pits, Poland, a region which was previously only sparsely inhabited because the land was difficult to farm.
Nomenclature.
The term "Walddeutsche" - coined by the Polish historians Marcin Bielski, 1531, Szymon Starowolski 1632, Bishop Ignacy Krasicki and Wincenty Pol - also sometimes refers to Germans living between Wisłoka and the San River part of the West Carpathian Plateau and the Central Beskidian Piedmont in Poland.
History.
In the 14th century a German settlement called Hanshof existed in the area. The Church of the Assumption of Holy Mary and St. Michael's Archangel in Haczów (Poland), the oldest wooden Gothic temple in Europe, was erected in the 14th century and was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 2003.
Germans settled in the territory of the Kingdom of Poland (territory of present day Subcarpathian Voivodeship) from the 14th to 16th centuries ("see Ostsiedlung"), mostly after the region returned to Polish sphere of influence in 1340, when Casimir III of Poland took the Czerwień towns.
Marcin Bielski states that Bolesław I Chrobry settled some Germans in the region to defend the borders against Hungary and Kievan Rus' but the arrivals were ill-suited to their task and turned to farming. Maciej Stryjkowski mentions German peasants near Przeworsk, Przemyśl, Sanok, and Jarosław, describing them as good farmers. 
Some Germans were attracted by kings seeking specialists in various trades, such as craftsmen and miners. They usually settled in newer market and mining settlements. The main settlement areas were in the vicinity of Krosno and some language islands in the Pits and the Rzeszów regions. The settlers in the Pits region were known as "Uplander Sachsen". Until approximately the 15th century, the ruling classes of most cities in present day Beskidian Piedmont consisted almost exclusively of Germans.
The Beskidian Germans underwent Polonization in the latter half of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century.
According to Wacław Maciejowski, writing in 1858, the people did not understand German but called themselves Głuchoniemcy. Wincenty Pol wrote in 1869 that their attire was similar to that of the Hungarian and Transylvanian Germans and that their main occupations were farming and weaving. He stated that in some areas the people were of Swedish origin, however, they all spoke flawlessly in a Lesser Poland dialect of Polish. In 1885, Józef Szujski wrote that the Gluchoniemcy spoke only Polish, but there were traces of a variety of original languages which showed that, when they arrived, the term "Niemiec" was applied to "everyone". In the modern Polish language, "Niemiec" refers to Germans, however, in earlier centuries, it was sometimes also used in reference to Hungarians, possibly due to similarity with the word "niemy" or plural "niemi" for "mute" or "dumb". In addition, "nie my" literally means "not us" in Polish.
Settlement.
Important cities of this region include Pilzno, Brzostek, Biecz, Gorlice, Ropczyce, Wielopole Skrzyńskie, Frysztak, Jasło, Krosno, Czudec, Rzeszów, Łańcut, Tyczyn, Brzozów, Jaćmierz, Rymanów, Przeworsk, Jarosław, Kańczuga, Przemyśl, Dynów, Brzozów, and Sanok.

Erma Werke

Erfurter Maschinenfabrik (ERMA) was a German weapons manufacturer founded in 1922 by Berthold Geipel. Prior to and during World War II they manufactured many firearms, including the K98k, MP40, and several other submachine guns.
They are also noted for having produced various forms of military training rifle, including the famous EL-24 and other models of subcaliber training device that allowed .22 long rifle ammunition to be fired from many infantry rifles such as the K98k and Steyr-Mannlicher M1895 through use of a special action conversion kit and a thin-walled .22 caliber barrel inserted within the larger rifle's bore.
History.
Erfurter Maschinenfabrik B. Geipel GmbH was formed in 1922 in Erfurt, Thuringia, by Berthold Geipel.
Post war.
In 1954 Geipel was arrested and imprisoned by the Allied occupation forces in Germany due to his involvement with the Nazi party. He was eventually freed and underwent denazification, after which he worked for Vollmer GmbH as Assistant Director to Heinrich Vollmer.
Following the end of the war, the Thuringen region found itself in the Soviet occupation zone. Marshal Shukow of the Soviet occupation forces ordered what was left of ERMA Werke to be liquidated on 31 August 1948.
Geipel re-established Erma Werke in Bavaria in 1949 and in 1952 the company moved to Dachau, near Munich. Geipel's son Rudolf became the chief Engineer of the new company and for the first few years production was devoted to household appliances. Around 1952 ERMA was awarded a contract by the government of West Germany to service and produce parts for the various Allied forces weapons that had been supplied to the German police.
Following the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1955, the Federal government gave Erma permission to research and develop a new submachine gun, as West Germany's police and army wished to replace the weapons given to them by the Allied forces. ERMA's design was, however, outbid and out-performed by a submission by Walther. The financial resources expended in developing the submachine gun had been quite substantial, and as a consequence ERMA was taken over in 1961 by Fiberglide, a division of Lear-Siegler, who traded under the Erma Werke name.
In October 1997 Erma Werke commenced bankruptcy proceedings and in 1998 was taken over by Suhler und Sportwaffen, a division of Steyr-Mannlicher, following which the ERMA Werke name ceased to exist.

Stainmore

Stainmore is a remote geographic area in the Pennines on the border of Cumbria, County Durham and North Yorkshire. The name is used for a civil parish in the Eden District of Cumbria, England, including the villages of North Stainmore and South Stainmore. The parish has a population of 253.
Geography.
Stainmore is drained by the River Belah and the River Balder. It is crossed by the Roman road from Bowes to Brough, now part of the A66, and formerly by the Stainmore Railway. Each of these lines of communication has made use of the relatively low broad saddle between the higher hills to north and south which is commonly referred to as the Stainmore Gap. The summit of the former railway is around above sea level, though the roads climb to slightly higher elevations. The Gap is coincident with the Stainmore Summit Fault which throws the relatively flat-lying Carboniferous rocks of the area down to the south. It acted as a conduit for Lake District-originated ice to pass eastwards during one or more glacial periods. 
There are several RIGS sites in the Stainmore area.
History.
According to Roger of Wendover, it was where Eric Bloodaxe (d. 954), recently expelled from York, was betrayed and killed, an event which some historians believe to have taken place in a great battle.
Ancient monuments include a Roman marching camp at Rey Cross (), and the Rey Cross itself (), also called Rere Cross (Scheduled monument, no. 32713).

Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters

The Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters (, DKNVS) is a learned society based in Trondheim, Norway.
History.
DKNVS was founded in 1760 by bishop of Nidaros Johan Ernst Gunnerus, headmaster at the Trondheim Cathedral School Gerhard Schøning and Councillor of State Peter Frederik Suhm under the name "Det Trondhiemske Selskab" (the Trondheim Society). From 1761 it published academic papers in a series titled "Skrifter". It was the northernmost learned society in the world, and was established in a time when Norway did not have universities or colleges.
It received the royal affirmation of its statutes on 17 July 1767, and was given its present name at a ceremony on 29 January 1788, the king's birthday. In 1771, when Johann Friedrich Struensee took over the de facto rule of Denmark-Norway, Johan Ernst Gunnerus was summoned to Copenhagen, where he was given the mission to establish a university in Norway. Gunnerus did not suggest that the university be established in Trondhjem, but in southern Christianssand (Kristiansand), due to its proximity to Jutland. If this happened, he would have the Society of Sciences and Letters moved to Christianssand, to correspond with the new university. However, the plan was never carried out. Struensee's reign ended in 1772, but he reportedly dismissed the plan before this. (Kristiansand got its university in 2007.)
The society was housed in the premises of Trondheim Cathedral School until 1866, when it acquired its own localities. Since 1903 its main task was to run a museum. In 1926 there was a split in which the museum became a separate entity, receiving the assets of the learned society. Also in 1926, another publication series "Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskab Forhandlinger" was inaugurated. Ownership of the museum was transferred to the University of Trondheim in 1968, today the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, but DKNVS re-received some assets in a 1984 reorganization, and now controls these assets through the foundation DKNVSS.
A history of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters was written in 1960 by Hans Midbøe, and released in two volumes.
Organisation.
The board of directors consists of seven people, five men and two women. It is led by praeses Steinar Supphellen and vice-praeses Kristian Fossheim. Other board members are Hanna Mustaparta, Britt Dale, Ola Dale, Joar Grimsbu and Asbjørn Moen. The daily administration is led by a secretary-general; Kristian Overskaug. The board is responsible for awarding the Gunnerus Medal for academic achievement. The medal was inaugurated in 1927.
Before 1815, the sitting King held the title of praeses, while the highest-ranked non-royal member was vice praeses. In the tradition of Gunnerus the bishop, the latter post was filled by clerics until 1820, when Christian Krohg took the seat. From 1815 the King holds the title of "protector". Today King Harald V of Norway is protector of the society.
Members of the learned society are divided into two divisions, Letters and Sciences. In 2005 there were 470 members, of whom 134 were foreign. This is a marked increase from 1996, when it had 399 members, of whom 94 were foreign.
Awards.
The society awards the following prizes
1. The Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters annual prize for young researchers (funded by IK Lykkes Fund)
2. The Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters scientific annual prize
3. Gunnerus Sustainability Award

Capillaria (nematode)

Capillaria is a genus of nematodes in the family Capillariidae (or, according to classifications, in the family Trichinellidae).
Since the taxonomy of the Capillariidae is disputed, species are included within the single genus Capillaria or 22 different genera ("Amphibiocapillaria, Aonchotheca, Baruscapillaria, Calodium, Capillaria, Capillostrongyloides, Crocodylocapillaria, Echinocoleus, Eucoleus, Freitascapillaria, Gessyella, Liniscus, Paracapillaria, Paracapillaroides, Pearsonema, Paratrichosoma, Pseudocapillaria, Piscicapillaria, Pseudocapillaroides, Pterothominx, Schulmanela", and "Tenoranema"). 
Some species parasitic in fish, previously classified within "Capillaria", are now included in "Huffmanela" (family Trichosomoididae).
Old literature, and sometimes modern medical literature, use "Capillaria" as a genus for species included in all these genera.
The term Capillariasis is generally used for diseases produced by species of "Capillaria", even if the species is now placed in another genus.

RBL 40 pounder Armstrong gun

The Armstrong RBL 40 pounder gun was an early attempt to use William Armstrong's new and innovative breechloading mechanism for medium artillery.
Design history.
The Armstrong "screw" breech had already proved successful in the RBL 12 pounder 8 cwt field gun, and the British Government requested it be implemented for heavier guns despite Armstrong's protests that the mechanism was unsuited to heavy guns.
The first version weighed 32 cwt, followed by the 35 cwt version which introduced a longer and stronger breech-piece.
Variants.
A 32 cwt variant having a horizontal sliding wedge breech instead of the Armstrong screw with vertical vent-piece was introduced in 1864 as an attempt to address the perceived weaknesses of the screw-breech design. It was withdrawn from service by 1877.
From 1880 a small number of 35 cwt guns had their trunnion rings rotated to the left to allow the vent-piece to open horizontally to the right, being known as "side-closing" guns. They differed from the wedge guns in that the vent piece was still locked in place by tightening the screw behind it.
Naval service.
The gun was recommended in 1859 for the Navy as a broadside or pivot gun.
An officer from HMS "Euryalus" described the gun's performance at the Bombardment of Kagoshima of August 1863:
Land service.
British Service.
The guns were typically employed mounted on high "siege travelling carriages" for use as semi-mobile guns in forts, firing over parapets. Many were mounted on travelling carriages and used by many Volunteer Artillery Batteries to whom they were issued after 1889. Most remained in use in this role until 1902. A number were used for some years afterwards as saluting guns.
Colony of Victoria service.
The Australian colony of Victoria received six 35 cwt guns in August 1865. They were used as mobile coast fortification guns with one gun being fitted to the colonial sloop "Victoria" during 1866 & 1867. Later four of the guns were used as field guns at Hastings. Three of these guns are known to survive.
Colony of Tasmania service.
As a result of the Jervois-Scratchley reports of 1877 into the defence of Australian colonies following the withdrawal of British troops, the Launceston Volunteer Artillery Corps in Tasmania acquired 2 guns on late-model iron carriages with iron wheels, which they continued to operate until at least 1902.

Albion press

The Albion press is a model of early iron hand printing press, originally designed and manufactured in London by Richard Whittaker Cope (d. 1828?) around 1820. It worked by a simple toggle action, unlike the complex lever-mechanism of the Columbian press and the Stanhope press. Albions continued to be manufactured, in a range of sizes, until the 1930s. They were used for commercial book-printing until the middle of the nineteenth century, and thereafter chiefly for proofing, jobbing work and by private presses. Francis Meynell often used an Albion to take proof impressions of his designs for Nonesuch Press books, and printed some small books and ephemera using the press. 
After Cope's death, Albions were manufactured by his heirs and members of the Hopkinson family (trading initially as 'Jonathan and Jeremiah Barrett' and later as 'Hopkinson and Cope'), who are said to have improved the design. From the 1850s onwards Albion presses were manufactured under licence by other firms, notably Harrild and Sons, Miller and Richard, and Frederick Ullmer Ltd. The toggle-action, and the distinctive shape and 'crown' finial of the Albion, make it instantly recognizable.

Allen's

Allen's (est. 1955) is a hamburger joint and nightclub originally in the Normaltown neighborhood of Athens, Georgia, now located at the corner of Hawthorne and Oglethorpe Avenues.
History.
Allen's was opened by Allen Saine. Saine later sold the business to Athens businessman Billy Slaughter. Slaughter hired Danny Self to run the business and eventually sold it to Self while keeping the real estate.
Allen's got its "World Famous" nickname because of its proximity to the Navy Supply School. The student officers frequented Allen's. They wear Allen's T-Shirts in ports all over the world.
In 2002, Self died and Slaughter ended up with the business eventually closing it in 2004 and later demolishing the building. In 2007, two University of Georgia alumni (Mark Hammond and Hilt Moree, III) acquired the rights to Allen's from Slaughter and re-opened it in a new location with much of the original memorabilia, recipes, and live music. It is across the street from the Athens YMCA location but still on the edge of Normaltown. There are various framed memorabilia on the walls.
Notable patrons and employees.
Zell Miller worked there while attending the University of Georgia before going on to become a Governor and later a U.S. Senator.
Notable patrons of Allen's include the late writer Lewis Grizzard, professional wrestler Bill Goldberg, lead guitarist/singer John Bell of Athens band Widespread Panic, R.E.M. lead singer Michael Stipe and The B-52's who namecheck Allen's in their 1990 single "Deadbeat Club".

Tatton Park Gardens

Tatton Park Gardens consist of formal and informal gardens in Tatton Park to the south of Tatton Hall, Cheshire, England (). Included in the gardens are an Italian garden, a walled garden, a rose garden and the Japanese garden. The buildings in the garden are the Conservatory, the Fernery and the Showhouse. The gardens are owned by the National Trust and administered by Cheshire East Council. They are on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens and have been designated at Grade II*. The gardens are open to the public at advertised times.
History.
The first formal gardens were created around the early 18th-century house and consisted of a walled garden to the south of the house, a formal semicircular pond to its north and formal lines of trees to the east and west. Later Samuel Wyatt set out an avenue of beeches to the south, which is now the Broad Walk. An arboretum was created during the 18th century and additions have been made to it since. The earliest reference to the arboretum is in 1795 when between five and ten species were present. The first formal garden to be created for the present house was Charlotte's Garden, designed by Lewis William Wyatt in 1814. Lewis also designed the sandstone Conservatory which was originally joined to the house by a glass passageway. This was also known as the Orangery because for a time it was used for growing oranges. In the 1830s a copy of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens was placed at the end of the Broad Walk. Gardens were established along the sides of the Broad Walk, including the Leech Pool and the area containing the Golden Brook.
In 1847 the terraces to the south of the house were laid out as an Italian Garden by Edward Milner to a design by Joseph Paxton. Later in the century, in 1883, Wilbraham Egerton added the stone balustrade. The statue of Neptune, which came from Venice, was added in 1920. Over the years changes have been made to this garden, and it was restored to its original design in 1986. In 1859 the Fernery had been built to a design by George Stokes, Paxton's assistant and son-in-law, to the west of the Conservatory to house tree ferns from New Zealand. The Fernery was seen in the TV miniseries Brideshead Revisited.
In 1910, inspired by a visit to the Anglo-Japanese Exhibition in London, Alan de Tatton created the Japanese Garden. Artifacts within the garden, including the Shinto shrine, are believed to have been brought from Japan for the construction of the garden. In 1913 Alan de Tatton laid out the Rose Garden for his wife which contained a pool for bathing. Maintenance work in this garden had to be completed by 10.00 am. to allow Lady Egerton to enjoy it without being disturbed. Later in the 20th century Maurice Egerton built the African Hut to the east of the Broad Walk as an association with his visits to Africa. He also planted large numbers of azaleas and rhododendrons. By the end of the 20th century the Japanese Garden had become overgrown and it was restored in 2001. Since then the kitchen garden has been restored and the head gardener is planning to construct a new garden to reflect garden design in the 20th and 21st centuries.
Layout.
The present garden entrance leads from the stable yard into the Walled Garden. On top of the north-facing wall are objects which look like urns, but which are actually chimney pots for what was once a heated wall. The ancillary buildings, including the mushroom sheds, onion stores, barns and glasshouses, have been restored to their former uses. The vegetable garden contains varieties of plants which were known to have be grown at Tatton in the Edwardian era. Some of the fruit in the garden was also grown during that time, while other varieties of fruit had been grown elsewhere in Cheshire. The glasshouses contain a representation of what would have been originally grown in them, including a restored pinery vinery for growing pineapples.
The Walled Garden leads into the "Pleasure Gardens" which were for enjoyment rather than utility. These contain the L Borders which include plants formally arranged to replicate the style of border developed by Gertrude Jekyll. To the south of the L Borders is Charlotte's Garden. This was designed as a Gardenesque type of garden, including a conservatory, an arbour, a fountain, a rockery and a snake path. These five elements can still be found in this garden. The L Border, the Broad Walk and Beech Avenue form the main path through the gardens to the south which lead to the Monument. Opposite Charlotte's Garden is the Topiary which leads to the Rose Garden. This garden contains artifacts, including a Tea House, many of which were taken from the estate of Rostherne Manor. To the south of the Rose Garden is the Tower Garden which contains a brick tower whose original purpose was to watch for sheep-stealing on the park land. This garden also contains articles from Rostherne Manor. Along the western border of the garden is the Arboretum which contains 880 plants in 281 species. Its important trees include a Giant Redwood, a Weymouth Pine, a Mexican White Pine, an Ernest's Fir and a Chilean Incense Cedar.
The Japanese Garden is to the west of the southern end of the Broad Walk and is considered to be the finest Japanese garden in the United Kingdom, if not in Europe. Artefacts in the garden include a Shinto Shrine, a tea house, a bridge over the Golden Brook, and a number of lanterns. The garden contains plants, stones and rocks which have been placed to provide a natural balance. The stones and rocks are selected for their shapes, and a mound has been formed to replicate Mount Fuji with its snow-capped summit. The plants include specimens of Japanese maple and various mosses. To the east of the Broad Walk is Maurice Egerton's African Hut. To the north of this is the Maze, which is planted with hornbeam and beech
To the southeast of Tatton Hall is the Italian Garden, a formal garden on two terraces. Its centrepiece is the statue of Neptune, which is unusual in that its pipework is visible at the back. To the south of the east end of the family wing are the Conservatory, the Fernery and the Showhouse.
Present day.
The gardens are owned by the National Trust and administered by Cheshire East Council. They are open to the public at advertised times. The Fernery still contains tree ferns and the Showhouse has changing displays of flowering plants. Produce from the Walled Garden can be purchased in the garden shop. A group of volunteers work to maintain the gardens. Courses are held on various aspects of gardening.

The Meaning of Witchcraft

The Meaning of Witchcraft is a non-fiction book written by Gerald Gardner, the, known to many in the modern sense as the "Father of Wicca", based around his experiences with the religion of Wicca and the New Forest Coven. It was first published in 1959, not long after laws punishing witches were repealed, and proved to be Gardner's final book. 
It is a sequel to Gardner's previous book on the subject, "Witchcraft Today", which was published in 1954. Chapters include: Witch's Memories and Beliefs, The Stone Age Origins of Witchcraft, Druidism and the Aryan Celts, Magic Thinking, Curious Beliefs about Witches, Signs and Symbols, The Black Mass, Some Allegations Examined. When Gardner died in 1964, the copyright for the book was left to the High Priestess of his coven, Monique Wilson.
Gardner wrote the book in order to publicise Wicca, which he believed would die out unless more converts could be attracted. Gardner himself believed that Wicca was the survival of an ancient pagan Witch-cult, a theory originating from historian Margaret Murray which has now largely been discredited by historians like Ronald Hutton and Jeffrey Russell.

History of Scottish devolution

The decision of the Parliament of Scotland to ratify the Treaty of Union in 1707 was not unanimous and from that time, individuals and organizations have advocated the reinstatement of a Scottish Parliament. Some have argued for devolution – a Scottish Parliament within the United Kingdom – while others have advocated complete independence. The people of Scotland first got the opportunity to vote in a referendum on proposals for devolution in 1979, and though a majority of those voting voted 'Yes', the referendum legislation also required 40% of the electorate to vote 'Yes' for the plans to be enacted. A second referendum opportunity in 1997, this time on a strong proposal, resulted in an overwhelming 'Yes' victory, leading to the Scotland Act 1998 being passed and the Scottish Parliament being established in 1999. Since then, additional powers have been devolved, and the Calman Commission is considering whether further powers should be transferred.
1707 to 1999.
Having agreed to pass the Union with England Act, the Parliament of Scotland 'adjourned' on 25 March 1707. The new united Kingdom of Great Britain came into being on 1 May 1707, with a single parliament of Great Britain which in effect was the Parliament of England with the addition of Scottish representation. The post of Secretary of State for Scotland existed after 1707 until the Jacobite rising of 1745. Thereafter, responsibility for Scotland lay primarily with the office of the Secretary of State for the Northern Department, usually exercised by the Lord Advocate. The Secretaries of State were reorganized in 1782 and the duties now came under the Secretary of State for the Home Department.
Administrative devolution (1885).
1885 saw the creation of the Scottish Office and the post of Secretary for Scotland. From 1892 the Secretary for Scotland sat in cabinet, but the position was not officially recognized as a full member of the cabinet of the United Kingdom until the Secretary for Scotland post was upgraded to full Secretary of State rank as Secretary of State for Scotland in 1926.
Government of Scotland Bill 1913.
In May 1913 the House of Commons passed the second reading of the Government of Scotland Bill 1913 or the Scottish Home Rule Bill by 204 votes to 159. The bill was supported by Liberals and opposed by Unionists.
Scottish Covenant Association (1940s and 1950s).
The Scottish Covenant Association was a non-partisan political organization that sought the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly. It was formed by John MacCormick who had left the Scottish National Party in 1942 when they decided to support all-out independence for Scotland rather than devolution as had been their position. 
The Association was responsible for the creation of the Scottish Covenant, which gathered two million signatures in support of devolution. Members of the organization were also responsible the removal of the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey in 1950 that attracted huge publicity for the cause of Scottish home rule.
1979 devolution referendum.
The Scottish referendum of 1979 was a post-legislative referendum to decide whether there was sufficient support for the Scotland Act 1978 that was to create a deliberative assembly for Scotland. The Act required that for the Act not to be repealed at least 40% of the electorate would have to vote "Yes" in the referendum. The referendum resulted in a narrow "Yes" majority but fell short of the 40% requirement.
1997 devolution referendum.
The Scottish devolution referendum of 1997 was a pre-legislative referendum over whether there was support for the creation of a Scottish Parliament within the United Kingdom and whether there was support for such a parliament to have tax varying powers. In response to the clear majority voting for both proposals, the United Kingdom Parliament passed the Scotland Act 1998, creating the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive.
The Scotland Act 1998.
The Act was introduced by the Labour government in 1998 after the 1997 referendum. It created the Scottish Parliament, setting out how Members of the Scottish Parliament are to be elected, making some provision about the internal operation of the Parliament (although many issues are left for the Parliament itself to regulate) and setting out the process for the Parliament to consider and pass Bills which become Acts of the Scottish Parliament once they receive Royal Assent. The Act specifically asserts the continued power of the UK Parliament to legislate in respect of Scotland.
The Act devolves all powers except over matter it specifies as reserved matters. It further designates a list of statutes which are not amenable to amendment or repeal by the Parliament which includes the Human Rights Act 1998 and many provisions of the Scotland Act itself. Even when acting within its legislative competence, the Act further constrains the powers of the Parliament by inhibiting it from acting in a manner incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights or European Community law. The same constraints apply to acts of the Scottish Executive.
Scottish Parliament established, May 1999.
The Scottish Parliament met for the first time on 12 May 1999 and began its first session with SNP member Winnie Ewing stating "the Scottish Parliament, adjourned on 25th day of March in the year 1707, is hereby reconvened"
Opening of new Scottish Parliament building (2004).
Construction of the Scottish Parliament building began in June 1999 and the first debate in the new building was held on Tuesday 7 September 2004. The formal opening by the Queen took place on 9 October 2004. Enric Miralles, the Catalan architect who designed the building, died before its completion. 
From 1999 until the opening of the new building in 2004, committee rooms and the debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament were housed in the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland located on The Mound in Edinburgh. Office and administrative accommodation in support of the Parliament were provided in buildings leased from the City of Edinburgh Council. The new Scottish Parliament Building brought together these different elements into one purpose built parliamentary complex, housing 129 MSPs and more than 1,000 staff and civil servants.
The building aims to conceive a poetic union between the Scottish landscape, its people, its culture and the city of Edinburgh, an approach that won the parliament building numerous awards including the 2005 Stirling Prize, and it has been described as "a tour de force of arts and crafts and quality without parallel in the last 100 years of British architecture".
Powers over Scottish railways transferred (2005).
As a result of provisions in the Railways Bill, powers were transferred from the Department of Transport to the Scottish Executive, a move described by then First Minister, Jack McConnell as "...the most significant devolution of new powers to Scottish ministers since 1999."
Scottish Executive becomes Scottish Government (2007).
A Scottish Executive was created under section 44 of the Scotland Act 1998. Following the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the Scottish Executive was rebranded as the Scottish Government by the new Scottish National Party administration. The Scottish Executive was legally renamed to the Scottish Government in the Scotland Act 2012.
Calman Commission (2007).
The Calman Commission was established by a motion passed by the Scottish Parliament on 6 December 2007. Its terms of reference are: "To review the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 in the light of experience and to recommend any changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to better serve the people of Scotland, that would improve the financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament and that would continue to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom." However, concerns have been expressed that its final report will not have "much legitimacy" because it was skewed towards preserving the status quo.
Powers transferred over planning and nature conservation matters at sea (2008).
During 2008, agreement was reached to transfer responsibility for all planning and nature conservation matters at sea up to 200 miles from the Scottish coast to the Scottish Government. The change has implications for the offshore industry, wind and wave power and to a lesser extent, fishing, though responsibility for fishing quotas remains an European Union issue and oil and gas licensing and permitting remains a reserved matter.
Referendum Bill 2010.
In August 2009 the SNP announced a Referendum Bill would be included in its package of bills to be debated before Parliament in 2009–10, with the intention of holding a referendum on the issues of Scottish independence in November 2010. The bill was not however expected to pass due the SNP's status as a minority administration, and due to the initial opposition to the Bill from all other major parties in the Scottish Parliament.

Thomas Jefferson Hotel

The Thomas Jefferson Hotel (later the Cabana Hotel, then Leer Tower) is a 19-story building, formerly a 350-room hotel, completed in 1929 at 1623 2nd Avenue North on the western side of downtown Birmingham, Alabama. It is well known for having the last rooftop zeppelin mooring mast in the world.
The hotel was planned and developed by the Union Realty Company, headed by Henry Cobb. The company was organized in November 1925 in the office of architect David O. Whilldin, who prepared the design for the $1.5 million project. The Foster-Creighton Company of Nashville, Tennessee was selected as contractor and work began on the site in May 1926. Progress was halted in April 1927 when one of the projects financiers, the Adair Realty and Trust Company of Atlanta, Georgia failed. A new holding company was formed and work resumed in July 1928. Costs reached $2.5 million before it opened on September 7, 1929. The hotel's opening week featured nightly banquets and dances featuring an orchestra from New York.
Interiors.
The hotel featured an ornate marble lobby, a large ballroom, and a rooftop mooring mast intended for use by dirigibles. The ground floor incorporated space for six shops and the basement included a billiard room and barber shop. The ballroom and dining rooms on the second floor opened out onto roof terraces from which the main tower rose. A Corinthian colonnade in glazed white terra-cotta set off the base of the tower, with the hotel entrance marked by a metal canopy. The fourth floor created an entablature, punctuated by the rhythm of windows that continued in brick for 13 more floors. The tower was capped on the top two floors with ornamented terra-cotta, including a balustrade and arched deep-set openings. The corners of the tower were clad in white brick to provide visual supports for the upper portion of the tower, while the narrow strips of brick between the windows were tan in color, each capped with a white acanthus leaf at the top. The edge of each corner was softened with a twisted-rope moulding, rising to a sculpted satyr at the top. The cornice rests on tightly spaced brackets with a shallow overhang of red mission tile suggesting a sloped roof.
A $35,000 improvement project was undertaken in 1933. Some of the retail spaces were subsumed into a larger hotel lobby with an electric fireplace. The dining room was similarly expanded and a banquet room was constructed over part of the roof terrace. It was only the first of several renovations for numerous owners. The Stirrup Cup lounge opened at the hotel on October 4, 1940. Birmingham newspapers declared the 200-room Thomas Jefferson Hotel as one of the finest in the country. Built to host huge gatherings, the $2.5 million facility was stocked with 7,000 pieces of silverware, 5,000 glasses and 4,000 sets of linen. As an affiliate of the National Hotels chain and under the management of Austin Frame, the Thomas Jefferson advertised rooms from $9 to 18 a night and multi-room suites for $18 to 35. All rooms were air conditioned and provided with a private bath, radio, television and Muzak. The hotel operated a laundry and valet service and housed a coffee shop, lounge, pharmacy and barber shop. Nightly dinner dances were held in the Windsor Room. Other rooms available for events included the Terrace Ballroom, Jefferson Room, Green Room, Gold Room, Board Room and Director's Room. 
"Southern charm and hospitality at its happy best, wonderful best. That's the pride of Birmingham The Hotel Thomas Jefferson," an early newspaper ad boasted.
A large vertically oriented painted sign for the Thomas Jefferson Hotel is still visible on the brick-clad west side of the tower. At one time the letters were outlined with neon tubes, fabricated and installed by Dixie Neon.
"It had an excellent chef. Among the bellboys, they were especially known for pecan pies," a man who was a bellboy in 1943 says with a smile, as if just being offered a piece. "Oh man, they were delicious."
Its luxury status made the Thomas Jefferson a prime spot for celebrities visiting the city, including Mickey Rooney and Ethel Merman. U.S Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover and singer Ray Charles have also stayed at the hotel. But most of the guests were businessmen, often salesmen who rented one room for sleeping and another as an office for peddling their inventory.
The hotel was a showplace with unparalleled amenities. And when the employees were not carrying luggage and serving guests, they operated a popular side business at the hotel. In the age of Prohibition, clever methods were used to meet the needs of thirsty guests. Bellboys would buy "Pensacola rye" from the nearby police station to sell to hotel guests.
Cabana Hotel.
The 1970s marked a period of decline for the aging luxury hotel, renamed as the Cabana Hotel in 1972. A new rooftop sign advertising the hotel was then added, along with a main hotel sign. The original ornate carpets were now replaced with shag carpets, and dropped ceilings were added. The economy had slowed, and a shift of attention to the northern end of town left older hotels, such as the Cabana, struggling. The scene was typical nationwide, as corporate mergers and new projects prompted the closing of many old buildings.
During its peak, the Cabana hosted Mickey Rooney and Ethel Merman during visits to Birmingham. A special suite was reserved for Bear Bryant during games at Legion Field. In Birmingham, the Cabana was the last of the perennial hotels to fade away following the demise of the original Tutwiler Hotel in 1974, and the Bankhead Hotel conversion into senior housing. Its demise was also quickened by the opening of the BJCC complex to the north, taking all of its business to the Hyatt House Birmingham Hotel (now Sheraton Birmingham) and the Holiday Inn Civic Center as well. It was a slow death that stripped it of most of its former glory. The hotel had suffered two major fires during this period of decline: one large one in 1980 and a smaller one in 1981. By 1981, the Cabana was a second-rate, $200-a-month apartment building with fewer than 100 residents. The hotel was shut down on May 31, 1983, by city health officials after it was declared uninhabitable on account of "bad plumbing, insufficient lighting, some inoperative smoke detectors and failure to upgrade to city fire codes".
Leer Tower.
In 2005 the Leer Corporation of Modesto, California, announced a $20 million proposal to convert the building into upscale condominiums, to be known as the Leer Tower. That proposal was delayed by a dispute over control of the building and the owner's inability to secure local financing. The property went into foreclosure in July 2008. Subsequently the property has fallen further into disrepair, with the basement only now recently drained of water and vagrants squatting in the upper floors.
Non-Profit seeks to renovate.
In 2012, it was reported that a nonprofit corporation, Thomas Jefferson Tower Inc., was raising funds to buy the building and renovate it into a hotel, possibly as part of a mixed-use development including retail, a grocery store, and apartments. These efforts would ultimately prove unsuccessful.
Purchase and Renovation Plans.
In August 2013, the building and its annex were acquired by TJTower LLC, a group of investors from Little Rock, Arkansas and New Orleans including former professional basketball player Brian Beshara. The former hotel will be one of the first projects in Alabama to utilize new state and federal tax credits designed to spur redevelopment of historic structures. Announced plans call for mixed-use conversion into 100 apartments, ground floor restaurant and retail space, and event/entertainment space in the former dining room and ballroom. It is one of multiple revitalization projects occurring in downtown Birmingham, along with the renovation of the long-closed Lyric Theater and the nearby Pizitz Building.

French weapons in the American Civil War

French weapons in the American Civil War had a key role in the conflict and encompassed most of the sectors of weaponry of the American Civil War (1861–1865), from artillery to firearms, submarines and ironclad warships. The effect of French weapons was especially significant in field artillery and infantry. These weapons were either American productions based on French designs, or sometimes directly imported from France.
Field Artillery.
The "canon obusier de 12", introduced in the French Army in 1853, an early type of "canon obusier", or gun howitzer developed during the reign of Napoleon III, was the primary cannon used in the American Civil War, under the name of "12-pounder Napoleon Model 1857". Over 1,100 such Napoleons were manufactured by the North, and 600 by the South.
The twelve-pound cannon "Napoleon" was the most popular smoothbore cannon used during the war. It was widely admired because of its safety, reliability, and killing power, especially at close range. It did not reach America until 1857. It was the last cast bronze gun used by an American army. The Federal version of the Napoleon can be recognized by the flared front end of the barrel, called the muzzle swell. Confederate Napoleons were produced in at least six variations, most of which had straight muzzles, but at least eight cataloged survivors of 133 identified have muzzle swells. Additionally, four iron Confederate Napoleons produced by Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia have been identified, of an estimated 125 cast.
Firearms.
The Minié rifle as well as the ammunition going with it, the Minié ball, developed by the French Army captain Claude-Étienne Minié, was the most widely used firearms system of the American Civil War. The Minié system was also used extensively by various manufacturers, such as Springfield, so that Springfield Model 1861 became most widely used rifle of the American Civil War.
The Minié ball produced terrible wounds on those struck in battle. The large-caliber rounds easily shattered bones, and in many cases the attending surgeon simply amputated the limb rather than risk a typically fatal secondary infection. The American Civil War, which often had many thousands of infantrymen armed with this type of ammunition, resulted in mass casualties on a scale which was inconceivable to contemporary strategists.
Submarines.
During the American Civil War, the Union-built and French-designed submarine "Alligator" was the first U.S. Navy submarine and the first to feature compressed air (for air supply) and an air filtration system. Initially hand-powered by oars, it was converted after 6 months to a screw propeller powered by a hand crank. With a crew of 20, it was larger than Confederate submarines. "Alligator" was 47 feet (14.3 m) long and about 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter. The submarine was lost in a storm off Cape Hatteras on April 1, 1863 with no crew and under tow to its first combat deployment at Charleston.
Ironclads.
As the Confederacy struggled against the North, it attempted to purchase one of the latest ironclads from France, the "Stonewall" (later to be acquired by Japan after the end of the war). The ship, built in Bordeaux, France by the L'Arman shipyard in 1864, was an ironclad ram warship. However, the French government embargoed the sale of the ship to the Confederacy in February 1864 (prior to her launch in June 1864), and then sold the ship to the Royal Danish Navy as the Stærkodder. However, L'Arman and the Danish Navy could not agree on a price for the ship, and sometime shortly after January 7, 1865 the vessel took on a Confederate crew and was commissioned the CSS "Stonewall" while still at sea; L'Arman had secretly resold her to the Confederacy.
The arrival of the "formidable" "Stonewall" in America was dreaded by the Union, and several ships tried to intercept her, among them the USS "Kearsarge" and the USS "Sacramento". In February and March, the USS "Niagara" and the "Sacramento" laid up at Ferrol, Spain, to prevent "Stonewall" from departing, but the much more powerful Confederate ship was able to make good her escape.
After an eventful crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, she eventually arrived in North American waters near the end of the American Civil War, too late to have a significant effect. (By the time of her October 1864 commissioning the Confederacy was in disarray and near defeat, its navy disintegrating, along with most other Confederate institutions.) To avoid surrendering the vessel, Captain Page sailed her into Havana harbor and turned her over to the Captain General of Cuba for the sum of $16,000.
The vessel was then turned over to United States authorities in return for reimbursement of the same amount. She was temporarily de-commissioned, stationed at a US Navy dock, until she was offered for sale to the Japanese government of the Tokugawa shogunate.

A Frozen Flower

A Frozen Flower () is a 2008 South Korean film. It is directed by Yoo Ha and stars Jo In-sung, Joo Jin-mo and Song Ji-hyo. The historical film is set during Goryeo Dynasty and is loosely based on the reign of Gongmin of Goryeo (1330–1374), but it does not strictly comply with historical facts. The controversial story is about the characters’ violation of royal family protocol and their pursuit of love.
It was released in South Korea on 30 December 2008 and was the 6th most attended film of 2008 with 3,772,976 tickets sold.
Plot.
The Goryeo King (Joo Jin-mo) is married to a Yuan Dynasty princess (Song Ji-hyo), but they do not have any children. There is constant pressure on the King both from the Yuan emperor and the Goryeo Kingdom to produce a crown prince and ensure the continuity of its royal dynasty. The King's palace guard is composed of thirty six young soldiers, led by military commander Hong-rim (Jo In-sung), who is also the King's gay lover. The King finally decides to charge Hong-rim, with a strange commission: make love to the Queen and beget a child. Hong-rim and the Queen are uncomfortable accepting the royal order, but they finally comply. However, their relationship does not stop at procreation, but genuinely true and intense romance soon blossoms between the two, and in this strong and close intimate relationship there is no place for the King.
The two passionate, intimate lovers surpass their "official mission" and continue to meet each other at midnight in the library in secret. The King begins to suspect Hong-rim's infidelity and soon gains evidence through another subordinate. To punish them and to also gauge the depth of Hong-rim's affection for the Queen, the King brings the two together to his chamber. The king tells them that he has decided that the Queen's "consummation" for an heir will continue, but only with another subordinate. The king remains firm in his decision despite entreaties from both the Queen and Hong-rim.
In despair, the Queen attempts to kill herself by slitting her wrists, but fails. In a last-ditch effort to change the King's mind, Hong-rim asks the Queen to stay away from him, and goes to the King to offer his own life in exchange for forgiveness. The King pardons him, believing Hong-rim's claim that his involvement with the Queen was purely lust. He decides to overlook everything that had happened, and instead orders Hong-rim to go away for a while to clear his mind and settle his emotions.
The night before Hong-rim's departure, the Queen's personal maid secretly informs him that the Queen wishes to meet him one last time. She also bears news that the Queen has finally conceived a child. Hong-rim sneaks out from the King's bedside to meet the Queen in the library. They end up making passionate love in the library, but the King has by now realised what is happening and catches them in flagrante delicto. When the two lovers attempt to save each other by begging the King to "kill me instead," the King realizes how strong and genuinely intimate their romantic love for each other is. In a jealous rage, he has Hong-rim castrated and sent to prison. 
The Queen now realises that the King will eliminate everyone who knows their secret, so she sends her maid to warn Hong-rim's loyal subordinates, and they manage to free Hong-rim from prison and flee the city with him.
Upon learning of the escape, the King demands to know Hong-rim's whereabouts from the Queen, but she refuses to answer. In response, he kills her maid. The King is then informed that the Queen is pregnant, and as the Queen had predicted, he then orders the execution of everyone who knows that he is not the child's father. Only his Junior commander, who taken over from Hong-rim, is spared. 
Some time later, and having recovered from his wound, Hong-rim realizes that the Queen is still in the palace, and not on the run, as his subordinates were ordered to tell him. Furious, he starts out for the city on horseback, despite their protests, but then he stops in his journey, realizing how futile it would be. However, on returning to the refuge, he finds that his men have been tracked down and captured.
At the palace, the King tortures the subordinates to discover the whereabouts of Hong-rim, but they remain silent, so the King has them killed and their heads are put up on posts on the palace gates, along with that of the Queen's maid. Her head bears the Queen's necklace, in order to trick Hong-rim into believing the queen is dead and forcing him to return to enact revenge. When Hong-rim returns to the city he sees this, and indeed becomes enraged and determines to kill the King. Disguising himself as a soldier, he enters the palace grounds during the celebrations for the Queen's pregnancy and hides out, awaiting his chance to reach the King and kill him. 
Meanwhile, as the King returns to his private quarters, he encounters the Queen, but he snubs her, and orders his Junior Commander to escort her back to her room. As the Commander is about to leave the Queen's chamber, she warns him that the King will surely have him killed as soon as the baby is born; she then says that if the Commander assassinates the King, and her father takes over the throne, she will guarantee that his life will be spared. The Junior Commander then calls a meeting of his most trusted subordinates and reveals the truth about the King, the Queen and Hong-rim. However, before they can carry out the Queen's plan, Hong-rim goes into action.
Ignoring the palace guards, who plead with him to leave before he is captured and killed, he fights his way to the King's quarters, cutting down all who oppose him. Reaching the King's chamber, Hong-rim confronts the King and demands that he fight him. An intense duel ensues, during which Hong-rim slashes the through the King's favourite painting, which depicts him and Hong-rim hunting together. As the desperate duel continues, the Junior Commander and his men arrive (presumably with the intention of killing the King, as the Queen had suggested) but the King orders them not to intervene, and the Junior Commander holds them back and awaits the outcome of the fight. At the climax of the duel, the King manages to break Hong-rim's sword, and stabs him in the shoulder. While Hong-rim is pinned by his sword, the King asks him a last question: whether or not Hong-rim had ever felt love for him. Hong-rim replies 'no'. Hearing this, the King is shocked, giving Hong-rim time to throw himself forward on the blade and kill the King with the shard of his own sword.
As the King dies, Hong-rim staggers to his feet, pulls the King's sword from his shoulder and charges at the guards, but he is fatally stabbed by the Junior Commander. Moments later the Queen comes upon the scene with the guards at her heels, trying to hold her back. Horrified, she tearfully calls out for Hong-rim. As she is taken away by the guards, Hong-rim realizes that the king had not killed her after all. He turns his head from her and dies facing the king, his eyes filled with realization of the King's test. The Junior Commander then declares that the King has been killed by an assassin, and he orders his men to quickly remove the bodies, and to tell no-one of what has transpired.
The final scenes of the film show a flashback to when the King showed young Hong-rim the view of the city and asked if Hong-rim wished to live together, to which the young Hong-rim replied "Yes." The film ends on a montage of the King and Hong-rim happily hunting together, referring back to a dream the King once had, as depicted in the King's painting.

According to historical records, after the death of his Mongolian-born queen, Noguk, King Gongmin descended into a life of homosexual debauchery, hiring a team of handsome male bodyguards of noble birth to serve in the palace in 1372. When one of the bodyguards made King Gongmin’s second wife pregnant, Gongmin tried to kill him to quell the scandal, but was killed by the bodyguard’s friends instead. But some historians disagree with this account, insisting that Gongmin was slandered in an attempt to justify the founding of the Joseon Dynasty, and that the youths were just bodyguards.
"A Frozen Flower" takes its title from a song of that era which described the sexual relationships between men and women. It is the fifth feature film by director Yoo Ha, who wanted to make a change from his previous works by doing a historical film, saying, "I always felt uncomfortable with the genre but I felt I should try to overcome those feelings. It is also a new challenge for me to focus on a melodrama." He also stated that the film was "a love story between men."
Jo In-sung was on board from the beginning of the project, and turned down other acting roles to make "A Frozen Flower" his last work before enlisting for military service. He chose to appear in the film without knowing the exact details, having faith in the director following their earlier collaboration in 2005 on "A Dirty Carnival". Jo began training for the role in August 2007, learning martial arts, fencing, horse riding and geomungo. The casting of Joo Jin-mo as the king was announced in December 2007.
The budget for "A Frozen Flower" was $10 million, and the film went into production on 16 April 2008. It was the first film to shoot at the newly built Jeonju Cinema Studio.
International.
The rights of the film were sold to Japan, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg before it was completed, and also a further seven countries at the European Film Market.

RBL 20 pounder Armstrong gun

The Armstrong Breech Loading 20 pounder gun, later known as RBL 20 pounder, was an early modern 3.75 inch rifled breech-loading light gun of 1859.
History.
The gun was effectively a larger version of the successful RBL 12 pounder 8 cwt Armstrong gun. There were different versions for land and sea service.
Sea service.
The RBL 20 pounder of 13 cwt and 15 cwt for sea service was introduced in 1859. It is 2½ feet shorter than the land version giving it a bore of only 54 inches (14.43 calibres), and hence a short stubby appearance. Its short barrel only allowed it to attain a muzzle velocity of 1,000 ft/second. 
The 15 cwt gun, identifiable by the raised coil in front of the vent slot, was intended for broadside use in sloops. The more lightly constructed 13 cwt gun was known as a pinnace gun and was intended for boat use.
Land service.
The RBL 20 pounder of 16 cwt for land service was introduced in 1860. It has a bore of 84 inches (22.36 calibres) and hence has the appearance of a typical field gun.

Robert Howlett

Robert Howlett (born 1831 in Theberton, Suffolk, died 10 Bedford Place, Campden Hill, Kensington, London, 2 Dec 1858), was a pioneering British photographer whose pictures are widely exhibited in major galleries. Howlett produced portraits of Crimean War heroes, genre scenes and landscapes. His photographs include the iconic picture of Isambard Kingdom Brunel which was part of a commission by "The Times" (or Illustrated Times) to document the construction of the world's largest steamship, the SS "Great Eastern".
He exhibited at the London Photographic Society and published "“On the Various Methods of Printing Photographic Pictures upon Paper, with Suggestions for Their Preservation.”" He worked in partnership with Joseph Cundall at "The Photographic Institution" at New Bond Street, London.
Howlett made photographic studies for the artist William Powell Frith's painting of "The Derby Day" which was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art.
Howlett was commissioned by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to photograph the frescoes in the new drawing-room at Buckingham Palace, make copies of the paintings by Raphael and make a series of portraits called 'Crimean Heroes' which was exhibited in 1857 the Photographic Society of London's annual exhibition.
Howlett died in 1858, aged 27. The cause of death was probably as a result of over-exposure to the arsenic and mercury used in the photographic process. The Illustrated Times praised him as "one of the most skillful photographers of the day".
Prints from Howlett's photographs were published posthumously by the London Stereoscopic and Photographic Company.
Life and work.
Robert Howlett was the second of four sons of Reverend Robert Howlett and Harriet Harsant. Two brothers died in infancy and his younger brother Thomas became a farmer. Robert was born in Theberton, Suffolk and the family had moved to Longham, Norfolk by the time he was 9 years old. Robert's maternal grandfather, Thomas Harsant, a surgeon, owned telescopes, microscopes, electrical machines, implements and instruments. Robert built his own microscope. Circa 1845, the parsonage in Longham had an electrical telegraph link to the local Manor House, this was only eight years after Samuel Morse filed his telegraphy patent in America. Thomas Harsant died in 1852 and left Robert £1000 plus his “turning lathe and all the apparatus and tools belonging thereto.” Robert was thus able to move to London He rose to prominence while working for the Photographic Institution at 168 New Bond Street, London, which was a leading establishment for the commercial promotion of photography through exhibitions, publications, and commissions. Although the Photographic Institution was established in 1853 by Joseph Cundall and Philip Henry Delamotte, it is believed that Howlett replaced Delamotte, who became professor of drawing at King's College London.
By 1856 Howlett was mentioned in the photographic press. He sent prints to the annual exhibitions of photographic societies in London, Manchester, and Norwich. These included landscape studies, "In the Valley of the River Mole, Mickleham", and "Box Hill, Surrey", which are presumed to have been taken in 1855.
He exhibited at the London Photographic Society and in 1856 published a booklet "“On the Various Methods of Printing Photographic Pictures upon Paper, with Suggestions for Their Preservation.”" He also designed and sold 'dark room tents' and worked in partnership with Joseph Cundall at "The Photographic Institution" at 168 New Bond Street, London.
Howlett undertook the first of a number of commissions for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1856, working for the Photographic Institution. These included copying the works of Raphael for Prince Albert, and making a series of portraits of heroic soldiers from the Crimean War. These were first exhibited in 1857 as 'Crimean Heroes' at the Photographic Society of London's annual exhibition. In 2004 Cundall and Howlett’s portraits of Crimean war veterans, were used by the Royal Mail for a set of six postage stamps to mark the 150th anniversary of the conflict.
Howlett's studio portraits at 'The Photographic Institute' included eminent 'fine artists' such as William Powell Frith, Frederick Richard Pickersgill, John Callcott Horsley, and Thomas Webster which were among a larger group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857.
Howlett was commissioned to make photographic studies of the crowd at the 1856 Epsom Derby for the painter William Powell Frith, who used them in 1858 for his painting of "The Derby Day" which was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art in 1959. The photographs were taken from the roof of a cab.
The "Great Eastern".
Howlett's major work was the commission by "The Times" (or "Illustrated Times") to document the construction of the worlds largest steamship the SS "Great Eastern". His images were translated into engravings for "The Illustrated Times". They reflected and stimulated the widespread interest in this feat of engineering.
This project included the well known portrait of the "Great Eastern"’s creator and engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, standing in front of the giant launching chains on the 'checking drum' braking mechanism at John Scott Russell’s Millwall shipyard. It was taken to celebrate the launch of the world’s largest steamship, in November 1857.
This image, which depicts Brunel in an industrial setting instead of a more traditional background for a portrait, has been described as "one of the first examples of environmental portraiture".
Death.
Howlett died in 1858, aged 27, in lodgings at 10 Bedford Place, Campden Hill, shortly after returning from a trip to France to try out a new 'wide angle lens'. The cause of death was probably as a result of over-exposure to the arsenic and mercury used in the Collodion photographic process that was invented by Frederick Scott Archer in about 1850. The Illustrated Times praised him as "one of the most skillful photographers of the day". However, the death certificate simply states 'febris' (fever), 20 days. Howlett had originally told a friend he had a cold. Typhus was also surmised as 1858 was the year of ‘The Great Stink.
Modern tribute.
In 2008, photojournalist David White recreated both Howlett's camera and the Brunel commission, travelling across south and west England. <br>
In 2009, the article The Light Shone and Was Spent: Robert Howlett and the Power of Photography by David White was published on PHOTO HISTORIES.

JDTic

JDTic is a drug that acts as an opioid antagonist, which is highly selective for the κ-opioid receptor, and blocks this receptor without affecting the μ- or δ-opioid receptors. It is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative, distantly structurally related to analgesic drugs such as meperidine and ketobemidone, and more closely to the μ opioid antagonist alvimopan, and is structurally distinct from other κ antagonists such as norbinaltorphimine. It has a very long duration of action, with effects in animals seen for up to several weeks after administration of a single dose, although its binding to the κ opioid receptor is not irreversible and its long-acting effects are instead caused by altered activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinases. Animal studies suggest that it may produce antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, as well as having possible application in the treatment of addiction to cocaine and morphine.
The high affinity of JDTic for the κ-opioid receptor suggested that it might be a suitable ligand for promoting the crystallization of this receptor for X-ray crystallographic studies. Such experiments were successful and lead to the publication of the first report of a high-resolution structure of an opioid receptor [ ].
The first human trial of JDTic was halted abruptly in May 2012 due to instances of ventricular tachycardia experienced by participants.

Hendrick Zwaardecroon

Hendrick or Henricus Zwaardecroon (26 January 1667 – 12 August 1728) was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1718 until 1725.
Early career.
Zwaardecroon left for the East Indies as a midshipman aboard the "Purmer" in December 1684 and arrived in Batavia in October 1685. During the trip he had several times been employed as secretary to Commissioner-General Van Rheede, which enabled him to make quick progress in his career with the Dutch East India Company (VOC). In 1686 he became Bookkeeper ("boekhouder") and subsequently Underbuyer ("onderkoopman"). In 1694, he was promoted to Buyer ("koopman") and in 1694 to Senior Buyer ("opperkoopman"). In the same year he was appointed Commander ("commandeur") in Jafnapatham in Ceylon. He was Commissioner ("commissaris") on the Malabar Coast and acting Governor of Ceylon in 1697. He became, in 1703, Secretary to the High Government of the Indies ("Hoge Regering") in Batavia, and in 1704, through the influence of the Governor-General, Joan van Hoorn, an extraordinary member of the Dutch Council of the Indies ("Raad van de Indië"). Through that membership, and later because the Governor-General Christoffel van Swoll had been trying to get him removed from the Council, preferably by promotion elsewhere, it took until 1715 before the Lords Seventeen ("Heren XVII") named him as full member ("gewoon lid").
Governor-general of the Dutch East Indies.
The day after the death of Christoffel van Swoll, on 12 November 1718, Zwaardecroon was named Governor-General. Only on 10 September 1720, was he confirmed in this post. His dismissal, by his own desire, came on 16 October 1724, though he handed the actual office to Mattheus de Haan only on 8 July 1725. 
During his term of office, Zwaardecroon had to deal with a lot of unrest in Batavia, including arson in the dockyards and an attack on the gunpowder stores. The wealthy Pieter Eberveld, had inherited some land from his father. The government laid claim to a part of this estate. Eberveld planned an attack on the Dutchmen but some of his slaves warned the government and the attack was thwarted. He confessed on the rack and was condemned to death, along with other plotters. His house was destroyed and a wall erected around where it had stood.His head was stuck on a lance and attached to the wall. A stone with an inscription was erected, indicating that never again would anything be built on that spot.

Zwaardecrood had always had a great interest in developing new products. He encouraged coffee-planting in Priangan in Java so that coffee production grew quickly. From 1723, the whole of the harvest had to be delivered to the Company. Then Zwaardecroon introduced silk production into Java as well as the production of vegetable dyes. Silk production was not so successful. In 1772 he re-established the Chinese tea trade, which had been disrupted. 
In 1719, Pakubuwono I of Kartasura in East Java died and was succeeded by his son, Amangkurat IV. Two of his brothers did not recognise his succession and rose in revolt, attacking Kartasura. This was repulsed by the Dutch occupying troops, but Zwaardecroon felt himself compelled to send more troops to East Java. The revolt was put down by 1723, but it took until 1752 until real peace was restored in the area. (Second Javanese War of Succession 1719 - 1723 [http://www.studybuddy.nl/nederlands/contentindo2.html]). Zwaardecroon took action against private traders, and thus got better relations with local Company top shareholders ("Bewindhouders"). In 1726, he had 26 Company servants brought to Batavia on charges of corruption. 
Zwaardecroon died on 12 August 1738 in his estate at Kaduang near Batavia. He said he felt more at home with ordinary townsfolk, and so at his request he was not buried with his predecessors as Governor-General, but in the graveyard of the "Portuguese Church Outside the Walls at Batavia" (Portuguese Buitenkerk) in Batavia, where his grave can still be visited.

St Breock

St Breock () is a village and a civil parish in north Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The spelling St Breoke was also formerly in use.
St Breock village is 1 mile (1.6 km) west of Wadebridge immediately to the south of the Royal Cornwall Showground. The village lies on the eastern slope of the wooded Nansent valley. The civil parish of St Breock is in Bodmin Registration District and the population in the 2001 census was 703. The parish extends approx five miles (8 kilometres) south of Wadebridge. To the north, the parish is bounded by the River Camel, to the west by St Issey parish and to the east by Egloshayle parish.
Together with Egloshayle it was one of the two parishes within which the town of Wadebridge developed.
Parish Church.
The parish church is dedicated to St Briocus and dates back to the 13th century although it was extensively rebuilt in 1677. (The aisle, south transept and porches are additions of the 15th and 16th centuries.) The church has a battlemented tower with a ring of five bells. It is situated beside the stream in the valley bottom and in 1965 suffered damage in a major flood. The nave is longer than usual in a parish church: this may be connected to the fact that the Bishops of Exeter owned the manor of Pawton before the Reformation and had a palace there. The church contains some fine monuments to members of the Tredeneck family and one of 1598 to William and Jane Viell. There is a brass probably also to a Tredeneck, ca. 1520. The church organ was the work of 'Father' Willis. Seth Ward, afterwards a bishop, was briefly the incumbent here.
Manor of Pawton.
The Manor of Pawton, already established in Saxon times, was very large, extending to six whole parishes and parts of four others. It was granted to the Bishops of Sherborne by King Egbert of Wessex and held by their successors until it was alienated under Henry VIII. In 1086 there were 44 hides of land, land for 60 ploughs, 40 villagers and 40 smallholders; pasture 12 sq leagues, woodland 2 sq leagues. Charles G. Henderson wrote in 1925 that slight remains of the bishop's palace and deer park were still to be seen. On the down above Pawton is a very large barrow with massive dolmen. At Nanscowe Farm a pillar stone of the 5th or 6th century with inscription meaning 'To the son of Ulcagnus; and to Severus' (in Latin).

Joel Erhardt

Joel Benedict Erhardt (February 21, 1838 - September 8, 1909) was an American politician, civil servant, lawyer and businessman. He served as the police commissioner for the New York Police Department, U.S. Marshal for the Southern Port of New York, the Collector of the Port of New York and was the Republican candidate who ran against Hugh J. Grant for the Mayor of New York in 1888.
Biography.
Joel Benedict Erhardt was born in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and moved with his parents, John Erhardt and Louisa Benedict, to New York City at the age of three. He came from a poor background, it being necessary for him to work in order to pay for the costs of public schooling, and was employed as messenger and clerk. Erhardt continued to work his way though college, becoming a schoolteacher in Upper Jay, New York, attending the University of Vermont as a law student. He continued his studies up until the start of the American Civil War whereupon he volunteered to enlist in the Union Army.
He initially joined the Ninth Militia Regiment, but reportedly anxious for active duty, he left the unit for the Second and then Seventy-First Regiments until finally leaving for the front lines with the Seventh Regiment. He had to borrow the money to pay for his uniform. After his enlistment period was up, he returned to his home state to raise the First Vermont Cavalry serving with them until 1863. He had reached the rank of Captain by that time and, that summer, he was appointed a provost marshal and assigned to New York City where he would oversee enforcing conscription in the Tenth District. Although criticized for the low number of recruits compared to the other provost marshals in the city, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton defended Erhardt's efforts stating "The men he enlists my be few but they go to the front and fight, every one of them. They are not bounty jumpers". In the days before the New York Draft Riots, he was confronted by several men with iron bars while trying to collect names in a new tenement building at Broadway and Liberty Street. Erhardt held the men off for three hours while waiting for reinforcements, armed only with his pistol, but was eventually forced to retreat without the names.
After the war, Erhardt became a lawyer and remained in New York serving as Assistant U.S. District Attorney in Brooklyn. In 1876, Erhardt was named as police commissioner of the New York Police Department by Governor Samuel J. Tilden after the dismissal of George Washington Matsell and Abram Disbecker by Mayor William H. Wickham. Erhardt was a strong advocate of introducing a style of military discipline within the department. He also criticized the substitution of one police commissioner as a replacement for the old four-man committee, commenting that "it was an absurdity to have a removable Commissioner at the head of an irremovable force", however it was widely speculated that for political reasons Mayor Edward Cooper insisted that charges be brought against the previous police commissioners. Nothing would came of the trial, however. 
In 1883, Erhardt was appointed U.S. Marshal for the Southern Port of New York by President Chester A. Arthur. He also became receiver of the New York City and Northern Railroad and, by 1888, the annual receipts of the road had risen from $24,000 to $400,000 when he returned control of the line to its owners. He was made its president of the company following its reorganization. That same year, he was nominated by the Republican Party to run for the Mayor of New York. Elihu Root, then U.S. District Attorney and a personal friend of Erhardt while a U.S. Marshal, publicly endorsed his candidacy stating: 
One of seven candidates, it was suggested at the time that Erhardt had merely been placed on the ticket as a political sacrifice for the Republicans. In spite of this, he made a strong showing in the race but was defeated by the Tammany Hall candidate Hugh J. Grant. Partly due to his popularity in the election, Erhardt was made Collector of the Port of New York shortly afterwards. His appointment was only reluctantly made by Thomas C. Platt, then a leader the Republican Party in New York, and because of Erhardt's resistance against the city's political machine he and his followers did everything within their power to interfere with and otherwise undermine Erhardt. He finally resigned in 1891 announcing that "the Collector has been reduced to a position where he is no longer an independent officer with authority commensurate with his responsibility". This was the last position he would ever hold.
He was a successful businessman in his later years, serving as the president and director of the Public Accountants' Corporation, trustee of the Bowery Savings Bank, director of Echo Lake Ice Company and interested in several other major corporations. Erhardt was also the director for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals until 1906 when he resigned due to a dispute with the management of the society. He was involved with a member of the Union League Club, Loyal Legion, New England Society, Saint Nicholas Society, Sphinx and Downtown Clubs.
In September 1909, Erhardt was staying at the Union League Club while his wife, Nora Belle Jewett, was visiting their daughter at York Harbor, Maine for part of the summer. He had told his private secretary that he had not been feeling well, believing he may have developed rheumatism, and his friends at the club noticed that he had been in ill health during the last month but appeared well while staying at the club. On the morning of September 7, at about 1:00 a.m., the club watchman was passing Erhardt's room and saw him sitting at the side of his bed and was told by him to get a doctor at once. His family physician, Dr. John Solley, was called from his home on West Fifty-Eighth Street but Erhardt died at 1:20 a.m. At the time of his death, he was the president of the Lawyers' Surety Company and a director in a number of corporations.

Hyman "Hy" Larner was an American gangster associated with Sam Giancana and the Chicago Outfit. Known in the newspapers as the "The Ivy League Mobster", he was the head of the Chicago Outfit's slot machine racket.
Hyman, a Jew, kept a low profile but was very powerful with the Chicago underworld. After Eddie Vogel retired from the gambling machine business, Larner became the power behind the scenes.
When he testified before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management in 1959, he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights fifty times. 
Larner expanded The Outfit's gambling and smuggling operations to Latin America, moving the organization's Miami operation to Latin America, headquartering in Panama, where money laundering was more easily facilitated by local banks. These operations were conducted as a partnership between the Mafia and the CIA. By 1966, this partnership had developed into arms smuggling to the Middle East for the Israeli Mossad, all via Panama. 
Hy Larner had friends among world leaders and key players in the CIA and the U.S. military, and he was also well connected with the Las Vegas bosses like the Teamsters' Allen Dorfman and media mogul Hank Greenspun. One of Larner's closest friends was Meyer Lansky and the two shared in their passionate Zionism and defense for the Jews' divine right to the land of Israel.

Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy

Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy (or myotonic hypertrophy) is a rare genetic condition characterized by reduced body fat and increased skeletal muscle size. Affected individuals have up to twice the usual amount of muscle mass in their bodies. They also tend to have increased muscle strength. Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is not known to cause any medical problems, and affected individuals are intellectually normal. The prevalence of this condition is unknown.
Mutations in the MSTN gene cause myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. The MSTN gene provides instructions for making a protein called myostatin, which is active in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) both before and after birth. This protein normally restrains muscle growth, ensuring that muscles do not grow too large. Mutations that reduce the production of functional myostatin lead to an overgrowth of muscle tissue. Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy has a pattern of inheritance known as incomplete autosomal dominance. People with a mutation in both copies of the MSTN gene in each cell (homozygotes) have significantly increased muscle mass and strength. People with a mutation in one copy of the MSTN gene in each cell (heterozygotes) also have increased muscle bulk, but to a lesser degree.

Djargurd Wurrung

The Djargurd wurrung are Indigenous Australian people who traditionally occupied the territory between Mount Emu Creek and Lake Corangamite, extending to Mount Emu and Cressy in the North, and to Cobden and Swan Marsh in the South in central Victoria and are still represented in the region. The town of Camperdown is in the middle of their territory. The territory was bordered by the Wada wurrung in the north, the Girai wurrung in the west and south west, the Gadubanud in the south, and the Gulidjan in the east.
Clan System.
The Djargurd wurrung people had 12 clans under a matrilineal system with a descent system based on the Gabadj (black cockatoo) and Grugidj (white cockatoo) moieties. The clans intermarried with Gulidjan, Girai wurring, Djab wurrung and Wada wurrung peoples.
History.
The Western District Lakes, now a Ramsar site, have been a focus for the Djargurd Wurrung and Gulidjan Aboriginal people for thousands of years. There are many archaeological sites registered that include fish traps, surface scatters, middens and burial sites. 
At the time of European settlement in the 1830s and 1840s the Djargurd suffered from massacres from European settlers, and also from attacks by the neighbouring Wada wurrung tribe. Dispossession from their land led to starvation and their theft of sheep resulted in murderous reprisals. In 1839 one clan, the "Tarnbeere gundidj", was massacred by Frederick Taylor and others in a site that came to be known as Murdering Gully.
When Framlingham Aboriginal Station was established in 1865 near Warnambool many of the surviving members of the Djargurd wurrung were forcibly relocated, however a number of elders refused to abandon their traditional country and stayed eking out a meagre living on the edge of towns like Camperdown. They were assisted by people like James Dawson, a Scotsman, who acted as guardian and supported them with his own money.
In 1883 Wombeetch Puuyuun (also known as Camperdown George) died at the age of 43 and was buried in a bog outside the bounds of Camperdown Cemetery. On Dawson's return from a trip to Scotland he was shocked at where his friend had been buried and personally reburied Wombeetch in Camperdown Cemetery. He appealed for money to raise a monument, but with little public support, primarily funded the monument himself. The 7 metre obelisk was erected as a memorial to Wombeetch Puuyuun and the aborigines of the district, and has been described as still inspiring today.

Cook Memorial Public Library District

The Cook Memorial Public Library District (CMPLD) serves six communities in northern Lake County, Illinois: Green Oaks, Indian Creek, Libertyville, Mettawa, and parts of Mundelein and Vernon Hills. There are two library facilities: Cook Park Library in Libertyville and Aspen Drive Library in Vernon Hills. CMPLD is a member of the Reaching Across Illinois Library System (RAILS).
The former Cook Memorial Library building, in Cook Park at 413 N. Milwaukee Ave., Libertyville, Illinois, is a classical revival building constructed in 1879 as the home of area businessman Ansel Brainerd Cook; it is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
History.
Local library service began in 1909 when the Alpha Club (now the Libertyville Woman’s Club) began a subscription library in Decker and Bond, a local drugstore. The small collection soon outgrew the few shelves in the drugstore and in 1914 found a new home in the Libertyville Village Hall. In 1921, the home and property of Ansel B. Cook were left to the village of Libertyville for library and park purposes; Cook Memorial Library opened to the public in November of that year. The first head librarian, Blanche Mitchell, lived with her husband in one of the upstairs rooms of Cook House.
In 1924, the Libertyville Township Library Board was organized to operate Cook Memorial Library, and library service continued to be offered to the community from the Cook House. As the library’s collection expanded to meet the demands of a growing population, the Children’s Department was moved offsite.
In 1968, a new brick building was constructed behind the Cook House, bringing the collection back together in one facility. The township library board was dissolved in 1973 with the formation of the Cook Memorial Public Library District. Shortly thereafter, parts of northern Vernon Township were annexed into the library district. In 1974, an automated circulation system was installed. In 1984, the basement was expanded by to house the Children’s Department, office space, and a public meeting room. Public internet stations were installed in 1995.
As the population served by CMPLD continued to grow, library space became crowded: By 1996, the library district’s population was more than 47,000 and its annual circulation was more than one million items. Three unsuccessful referenda left the southern part of the library district underserved. In 2002, then serving a population of more than 58,000, CMPLD entered into an agreement with Vernon Hills to rent space in the lower level of its Village Hall on Evergreen Drive. The Evergreen Interim Library, , opened on January 13, 2003.
To alleviate a continued lack of adequate space, in 2007 the CMPLD board adopted an expansion proposal calling for the addition of to the district's facilities. The $14-million project called for the construction of a library on Aspen Drive in Vernon Hills and adding about to Cook Park Library, along with renovating existing space at the site. 
While the Cook Park site was being remodeled, a temporary library location was established in order to continue services and programming. The new Aspen Drive Library opened on July 10, 2010. The remodeled Cook Park Library reopened on January 8, 2011.
In 2013, the Cook Memorial Public Library District was serving 60,000 people in Libertyville, Vernon Hills, Green Oaks, and Mundelein. The District continues to operate two full-service libraries at 413 N. Milwaukee Avenue in Libertyville and 701 Aspen Drive in Vernon Hills, a digital collection, as well as a Bookmobile and Outreach.

Iggesund Paperboard

Iggesund Paperboard is a commission company of the Holmen Group and Europe's third largest manufacturer of high quality virgin fibre paperboard. Iggesund has a market share of about 20% in this sector.
History.
Iggesund is an industrial village in Sweden. Isak Breant Sr, a businessman and former court commissioner to Queen Kristina, established there a mill in 1685. Iggesunds Bruk (English:mill) was originally an ironworks, and the nearby forests were used to produce charcoal for the factory. In 1771, Iggesund Bruk acquired a small nearby company that made paper, Östanå paper mill. It was one of the first to try to use sawdust and wood to produce paper. However, the technique remained experimental. The mill burnt down in 1842. In 1869, Baron Gustav Tamm became the owner of Iggesunds Bruk, and built a large sawmill. It was a major transformation for the factory, which had always been an ironworks. 
Iggesund’s shares were first listed on Stockholmsbörsen in 1949. Lars G. Sundblad introduced paperboard manufacturing at Iggesund, which started in 1963. The merger of MoDo, Holmen and Iggesund resulted in the delisting of Iggesund shares from Stockholmsbörsen (1988), making Iggesund part of the holding, which was renamed to Holmen AB in 2000 
Products.
Iggesund Paperboard's product range consists of two product families:

Mortier de 12 Gribeauval

The Mortier de 12 pouces Gribeauval (Gribeauval 12-inch mortar) was a French mortar and part of the Gribeauval system developed by Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. It was part of the siege artillery. The measurement of the mortar is expressed by the diameter of the ball, using the French ancient system of measurement, in which 1 pouce (1 inch) is worth 2.707 cm. 
The Mortier de 12 pouces Gribeauval was used extensively during the wars following the French Revolution, as well as the Napoleonic wars. However, its first major operational use was even earlier, during the American Revolutionary War, in General Rochambeau's French expeditionary corps, from 1780 to late 1782, and especially at Yorktown in 1781.
The Mortier de 12 pouces used a cylindrical chamber, which, although quite efficient used to wear easily. It was superseded by the Gomer system using a conical chamber, which was incorporated in Gribeauval's system in 1789.
Some of the Mortier de 12 pouces were used in coastal defenses, in which case they were fixed on solid metal platforms.

Rampant Lions Press

The Rampant Lions Press was a fine letterpress printing firm in Britain, operating from 1924 to 2008. The firm was founded by Will Carter (1912–2001), and was continued by his son, Sebastian (b. 1941).
It started life as a private press in 1924, when Will was still a schoolboy. After the war, his interest in printing was such that he decided to try to establish the Press on a commercial footing, and did so in Cambridge in 1949. From that date until the formal closure of the Press at the end of 2008, Rampant Lions has been among the most highly regarded letterpress printing-offices in Britain. The skills of Will and Sebastian Carter in design and press-work have been recognized by publishers, who commissioned work from them, and by collectors, who have sought out their publications since the 1950s. Sebastian Carter also has an international reputation as a writer on type and typography.

William Edward Hodgson Berwick

William Edward Hodgson Berwick (11 March 1888 in Dudley Hill, Bradford – 13 May 1944 in Bangor, Gwynedd) was a British mathematician, specializing in algebra, who worked on the problem of computing an integral basis for the algebraic integers in a simple algebraic extension of the rationals.
Academic career.
Berwick was educated at a small private school before entering Bradford Grammar School. He completed his schooling in 1906, securing a Brown Scholarship to assist him in his university studies; he was also awarded an Entrance Scholarship by Clare College, Cambridge, where he went to study for the Mathematical Tripos. He took Part I of the degree in 1909, placing joint fourth in the class, and Part II in 1910.
During his undergraduate years, under the tutelage of G B Matthews, Berwick became interested in number theory. He submitted an essay entitled "An illustration of the theory of relative corpora" for the Smith's Prize in 1911; the essay was placed second in the prize competition. He then co-wrote, with Matthews, a paper "On the reduction of arithmetical binary cubics which have a negative determinant": it was published after Berwick had left Cambridge to take up an assistant lectureship at the University of Bristol, and was the only paper Berwick co-authored in his career.
Berwick taught at Bristol until 1913 when he took up another lectureship at the University College of Bangor. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Berwick began war work on the Technical Staff of the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section of the Munitions Inventions Department at Portsmouth. For the 1919–20 academic year Berwick was appointed acting head of the Bangor mathematics department; he then took up a lectureship at the University of Leeds, earning promotion to a Readership in Mathematical Analysis there in 1921. He was also elected to a fellowship at Clare College, Cambridge, in 1921.
In 1926, with thirteen research papers to his name, Berwick returned to Bangor to serve as Chairman of Mathematics. He had in 1925 become a member of the Council of the London Mathematical Society; in 1929 he was appointed Vice-President. He retired the post in 1941, at which point he was created Emeritus Professor.
Research and publications.
Berwick was an algebraist, and worked on the problem of computing an integral basis for the algebraic integers in a simple algebraic extension of the rationals, and studied rings in algebraic integers. In 1927 he published "Integral Bases", an ambitious account that used heavy numerical computations in place of practical proofs. 
He published sixteen papers, ten of them — including a 1915 paper giving sufficient conditions for a quintic expression to be solved by radicals — in "Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society". Much of his work gained recognition only in the 1960s, when it was republished.
Personal life.
Berwick was described as a tall man with a distinctive voice and forthright personal style. He was a keen chess player, participating in the clubs at his various universities. He had a keen interest in teaching, publishing a number of mathematical recreation articles and giving several addresses at meetings of the British Association.
In 1923, while living in Leeds, Berwick married Daisy May Thomas, the daughter of Dr W R Thomas. His health began to fail after his 1926 return to Bangor; he published only five further papers after taking up this position. He died in Bangor, Maine in 1944.
Legacy.
Berwick endowed funds for two prizes to the London Mathematical Society; after his death they were used to create the Senior Berwick prize and Junior Berwick prize, both of which are still awarded.

<doc id="20462318" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20462318" title="Aeroflot Flight 3352">
Aeroflot Flight 3352

Aeroflot Flight 3352 was a Tupolev Tu-154 airline flight on a domestic route from Krasnodar to Novosibirsk, with an intermediate landing in Omsk. While landing at Omsk Airport on Thursday, October 11, 1984, the aircraft crashed into maintenance vehicles on the runway, killing 174 people on board and 4 on the ground. While a chain of mistakes in airport operations contributed to the accident, its major cause was an air traffic controller falling asleep on duty. As of 2013, this remains the deadliest aviation accident in Russian territory.
Accident details.
At 5:00 am local time (UTC/GMT + 7 hours), Flight 3352 was preparing to land at Tsentralny Airport in Omsk, a key Russian city in southwestern Siberia, which has a population of over 1 million and is the administrative center of Omsk Oblast. At the time, this was the only aircraft approaching Omsk, and it was cleared for landing when it contacted the airport.
At 5:20 am, worried that the continuing rain would make the runway overly slippery, the airport ground maintenance crew requested permission to dry the runway. The ground controller on duty gave permission and proceeded to fall asleep soon after, in the process forgetting to switch on the "runway occupied" warning. In any case, under airport regulations, this whole procedure should never have happened; permission to close and do maintenance on a runway could only be given by the chief controller, and he was absent.
The maintenance crew, following the airport's routine, moved three vehicles to the runway: a UAZ-469 all-terrain vehicle with an attached trailer, operated by a driver and crew manager in front; followed by KrAZ and Ural trucks. The latter were equipped with dry air compressors and loaded with fuel, and weighed 16–20 tons. The drying detail then proceeded to violate their own safety rules while performing their tasks: all of their vehicles should have their top, flickering lights on continuously. However, the lights were too bright for the maintenance workers' liking, so they kept them lit only until they started and after they finished their work.
This intentional oversight was to play a part in the pilots being unable to see the vehicles on the runway (they could not from the air). In contrast, the runway crew saw the Tu-154 coming at them from a good distance, its landing lights on. They did attempt to contact ground control three times about the lights, but received no response and so ignored them, thinking they were being tested by a plane not on final approach.
Around 5:36 am, Flight 3352 requested permission to land from the approach controller. The request was sent twice; the pilots noticed vague contours on the runway and wanted to double check for obstacles. The controller verified the runway status, which remained apparently unoccupied, then contacted the ground controller and received no response, and subsequently contacted the flight controller on internal radio and received an inaudible reply that sounded like "..ree" (original, ) and was taken as "free" (; communications were being taped and were analyzed later). The approach controller cleared the landing, though unable to see the runway, and in spite of regulations that required him to keep the flight in the air and double check the runway's status. Both the ground controller and secondary controller should have been able to see the runway, but the former was asleep, and the latter was absent due to staff shortages.
At 5:38 am, the flight passed the lowest height at which the flight crew could abort the landing. The aircraft landed at a normal 240 km/h (149 mph/130 knots). On touchdown, the flight crew saw the array of drying vehicles and attempted to turn the aircraft, but were unable to avoid the collision. The plane crashed into the Ural truck and then 200 m down the runway crashed into the KrAZ, igniting the 7 tons of fuel in each truck and the aircraft's fuel tank. The plane overturned and broke into pieces, some of which crashed into the UAZ-469. A catastrophic fracture of the fuel tanks caused burning fuel to leak into the fuselage, incinerating all but one passenger. The cockpit section detached and flew past the burning vehicles. It suffered no major damage, and all four crew members survived, suffering only minor injuries. They escaped from the cabin and ran to the crash site in an attempt to help the passengers. Four ground maintenance crew were killed instantly inside the vehicles. One survivor in the passenger seat of the UAZ caught on fire, which was extinguished.
Investigation.
A State investigation concluded that the accident was caused by a chain of mistakes owing to the negligence of air traffic controllers, as well as disobedience of basic airport maintenance and safety regulations. The ground controller was found directly responsible, as he fell asleep on the job and thus did not respond to emergency queries; he also allowed the service trucks to move onto the runway and did not mark the runway as occupied. At a hearing, he could not recollect his actions during the time in question, but did not deny the charges. He was sentenced to 15 years and committed suicide in prison. In addition, the flight operations manager was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the approach controller to 13 years, and the head of airport maintenance to 12 years. All three appealed their sentences, to no avail. Future inspections at numerous other Soviet airports also found similar types and numbers of violations of safety regulations, resulting in the firing of several high-level officials thereafter.
No pilot error or aircraft deficiency was found. Flight mass and centering were within norms. Owing to poor visibility, the crew could not detect the obstructions on the runway. While they did have some reasonable doubts as to whether or not the runway was occupied, these were allayed by the approach controller's reassurances. The crew had only a few seconds to avoid the collision on the ground; they took evasive action, but could not possibly save the aircraft. They were thus absolved of any blame.
The flight controller and approach controller were experienced professionals with at least 10 years of service. The ground controller on duty, who was 23 years old, was new. He supposedly had not gotten enough sleep in the days before the accident, having had to care for his two young children.
The formal hearing of the case occurred only 3 months after the accident, due to the obvious set of circumstances; most of that time was spent on identifying the victims and locating their relatives. All of the accused, as well as their attorneys, received threats and were moved to the hearings under heavy security.
Technical data and statistics.
The Tupolev Tu-154B-1 was operated by Aeroflot (later becoming East Siberia). It was equipped with three Kuznetsov NK-8-2U engines, and first flew in 1977.
The flight carried 170 passengers, including 8 teenagers and 16 young children; 2700 kg of luggage, 306 kg of post, and 1600 kg of cargo.
The flight had a crew of 9. The captain was highly experienced, with 16,365 hours in the air (including 4303 hours of night flights).
The flight was approaching Omsk in poor weather: light rain, visibility 2 miles with a 300 foot ceiling.
At the time it took place, the accident was the deadliest one in Soviet aviation history. It was surpassed on 10 July 1985 by Aeroflot Flight 7425, another Tu-154, which crashed in Uzbek SSR (modern day Uzbekistan), and killed 200 people.

Football career.
During the vast majority of his career, Gaspar rarely played more than one season with the same club. He represented C.D. Trofense, F.C. Tirsense (where he made his first division debuts), Vitória de Setúbal, F.C. Porto (which were crowned league champions at the end of the 1997–98 campaign, but he was only fourth of fifth-choice in his position), Leça FC – in a brief return to the second level – F.C. Alverca (he represented the Lisbon club on two occasions), F.C. Paços de Ferreira and Gil Vicente FC, amassing totals of 185 top flight games (with 16 goals scored) in his first eight years as a professional.
In the 2004–05 campaign Gaspar played for AC Ajaccio in France, appearing in 16 Ligue 1 matches, then switched back to his country with C.F. Os Belenenses. At the age of already 32 he would settle at Rio Ave FC, helping the Vila do Conde side return to the top division in his first season while adding a round-of-16 presence in the domestic cup.
From 2008 to 2011 Gaspar only missed five league matches for Rio Ave combined, also netting three goals as the club consecutively managed to maintain its division status. In July 2012, after having appeared in a total of 322 games in the main category of Portuguese football (19 goals), he signed for one year with S.C. Covilhã in division two.

Samson Press

The Samson Press was a small letterpress printing business or private press run by Joan Mary Shelmerdine (1899–1994) and Flora Margaret Grierson (1899–1966). They began printing in 1930, at a cottage in Stuart Road, Warlingham in Surrey, and produced a number of small books and a good deal of ephemera before the Press was destroyed by fire in late 1936. They subsequently moved to Woodstock in Oxfordshire, where they re-established the Press in 1937. They ceased printing for a while during the war, but re-opened the Press in 1946 and continued to work, mostly producing greetings cards and other ephemera, until 1967, when the Press was formally closed (following the death of Grierson in the previous year). Shelmerdine subsequently presented the Press's archive, along with its type and printing equipment, to the Bodleian Library in Oxford.
The Samson Press was unusual for being run by two women, on a commercial footing, at a time when women found it very hard to find practical employment in the printing industry. It was also notable for its patronage of young and unknown artists, who were commissioned to provide wood-engravings, linocuts and drawings for the Press's publications.

Hann River

The Hann River is a river in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. 
The traditional owners of the areas around the river are the "Ola" peoples.
It was named after the first European to discover the river, Frank Hann, who had seen it during his expedition to the region in 1898 and named it the Phillips River. It was renamed in 1900 by the Surveyor General H F Johnston to honour Hann; a Philips River already existed in the south of the state.
The river rises below Mount Lacy and Sir John Gorge and then flows in a southerly direction past Mount Elizabeth then crossing the Gibb River Road. The river then cuts through the Barnett Range and then passes through the Phillips Range via Moll Gorge and flows through the Barnett Range until it flows into the Fitzroy River, of which it is a tributary, near Pinnamutta-Murrawong Hill.
The Hann has 12 tributaries including Traine River, Barnett River, Harris Creek, Bella Creek, Macnamara Creek, Crocodile Creek and Grey Mare Creek.
The river has the only known specimens of the grass-like "Whiteochloa sp. Hann River", a threatened species of Poaceae, located along its course.
Fish such as the Western rainbowfish, the Kimberley archerfish, Greenway's grunter and the False spotted gudgeon have all been found within the river system.

Coelacanthopsis

Coelacanthopsis is an extinct genus of lobe-finned fish which lived during the Carboniferous period.
The Coelacanth is the only living example of the fossil Coelacanth fishes Actinistia. They are also the closest link between fish and the first amphibian creatures which made the transition from sea to land in the Devonian period (408-362 Million Years Ago). That such a creature could have existed for so long is nearly incredible, but some say that the cold depths of the West Indian ocean at which the Coelacanth thrives, and the small number of predators it has, may have helped the species survive eons of change.
The Coelacanth was first discovered in 1938 by Marjorie Courtenay Latimer, the curator of a small museum in the port town of East London, as she was visiting a fisherman who would let her search through his boat's catch for interesting specimens. Ironically, Marjorie was only visiting the sea captain to wish him a happy Christmas when she first spotted the Coelacanth's oddly shaped, blue-gray fin protruding from beneath a mountain of fish. Marjorie brought back the specimen to the museum where she compared it against images of known species, and ultimately realized what she had was no ordinary fish. 
After sending a rough drawing of the fish to Professor J.L.B. Smith, at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, who in turn confirmed that the creature she had discovered on the boat's deck was indeed a prehistoric fish, a Coelacanth to be exact.
Since then, Coelacanth populations have been found near Indonesia, South Africa, and other unexpected places. While there have been enough sightings of the creature to indicate that there is more than one area where the species exists, it remains a highly protected and mysterious animal, a living fossil which may, or may not be the only creature from our past which has survived millions of years of evolution.
Some place it in the family Rhabdodermatidae.

Germania Brötzingen

Germania Brötzingen is a German association football club from the district of Brötzingen in Pforzheim, Baden-Württemberg. Together with the 1. FC Pforzheim and VfR Pforzheim, it is one of three clubs in the city who have played higher league football.
On 1 July 2011, the club merged with 1. FC Eutingen to form SV Kickers Pforzheim, with the new side playing in the tier seven Landesliga.
History.
The club was established in December 1906 as "Fuβball-Club Germania Brötzingen". In 1913, it was merged briefly with "Ballspielclub 05 Brötzingen" as "BC Germania Pforzheim", but the union quickly fell apart. Following World War I, in 1920, several clubs including "Turnverein Brötzingen", "KSV Achilles Brötzingen", and "Radfahrclub Sturm Brötzingen" joined with "FC" to create the current club.
"FC" enjoyed a steady string of successes in local play that soon saw the club promoted to the senior regional circuit, the "Kreisliga Südwest" and then the "Bezirksliga Württemberg-Baden", where they took part in qualification for the national playoff round in 1928–29. Following the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich into 16 top flight divisions, "Brötzingen" became part of the Gauliga Baden. A poor campaign led to the 
club's demotion after their debut season, but they returned to the Gauliga to play three more seasons between 1935–38.
After World War II, "FC" became part of the Amateurliga Nordbaden-Süd, later the Amateurliga Baden (II), where they fared poorly through the late 40s and 50s. The side improved in the 60s and enjoyed local title and cup wins on their way to promotion to the Amateurliga Nordbaden (III) in 1968. "FC" was relegated after a 16th place result there in 1971 and returned to the Bezirksliga (VIII) level.
Spending its final four seasons at Kreisliga level, where the side achieved a second place finish in 2011, the club eventually disappeared through a merger with 1. FC Eutingen to form SV Kickers Pforzheim on 1 July 2011.

Meshterski

Meshterski () or Meshtrenski (мещренски) was the cant, or secret sociolect, of the south Bulgarian builders, bricklayers and masons. The name comes from the word мещра "meshtra", "master", from Latin "magister". Meshterski served a linguistically isolating purpose, enabling the builders to communicate in secrecy, and a socially isolating purpose, emphasizing the builders' perceived supremacy over their contractors.
Distribution and vocabulary.
The sociolect emerged among the Bulgarian masons in southwestern Macedonia, adjacent to the Albanian lands. As a result, it includes a large number of Albanian loanwords, e.g. бука "buka", "bread", from "bukё"; гяхта "gyahta", "cheese", from "djathë"; мерам "meram", "to take", from "marr". There are much fewer loans from Greek (e.g. лашма "lashma", "mud", from λάσπη "laspi"; карекла "karekla", "chair", from καρέκλα "karékla") and Turkish (e.g. пиринч "pirinch", "rice", from "pirinç"; сакал "sakal", "beard", from "sakal"). Later, the language spread through migration to northeastern Macedonia (the region of Gotse Delchev), the Rhodope Mountains around Smolyan, and the areas of Asenovgrad, Kazanlak and the sub-Balkan valleys.
Although loanwords often remained semantically unchanged, the Bulgarian vocabulary in the sociolect was substituted with native metaphors, metonyms and words from different roots, so as to conceal the true meaning to outsiders, e.g. мокра "mokra" ("wet", fem.) for вода "voda", "water"; гледач "gledach" ("looker") for око "oko", "eye", обло "oblo" ("round", neut.) for яйце "yaytse", "egg". The lexis of Meshterski included not only professional terms and basic vocabulary, but also other words, including religious terms, such as Светлив "Svetliv", "Luminous", referring to God or a saint.
Meshterski also spread to other social areas: it was borrowed by tinsmiths in at least one village in the Rhodopes, although with a much reduced vocabulary and renamed to "Ganamarski". Albanian words mediated through Meshterski have also entered informal Bulgarian; these included кекав "kekav", "weak, sickly" (from "keq"); кинти "kinti", "money, dough" (from "qind", "hundred"), скивам "skivam", "to see, to take a look" (from "shqyrtoj"), келеш "kelesh", "squirt, mangy fellow" (from "qelesh").

Ivor Brown (speedway rider)

Ivor John Brown (30 May 1927-30 March 2005) was a motorcycle speedway rider and captain of Cradley Heath Heathens speedway team during the 1960s. After retiring from riding he became promoter of Long Eaton and Scunthorpe speedway. His off-track occupation was postmaster and grocer of the village General Stores in Wymeswold.
Career.
Born in Wymeswold, Leicestershire, Ivor Brown started speedway racing at Long Eaton in 1952, following earlier grasstrack riding, and moved to second-half rides at Birmingham and then Leicester. He made a few team appearances for Leicester Hunters between 1953 and 1959, but it was at Yarmouth that he first made regular team appearances, when he was skipper of the Yarmouth Bloaters team in the Southern Area League and the 1960 inaugural Provincial League competition, scoring 176 points from 18 matches. 
With the closure of Yarmouth he transferred to Cradley Heath Heathens for 1961. He topped the Provincial League averages and led the team to three Knockout Cup finals (including two wins) in four years. In 1965 and the formation of an amalgamated British League he sustained serious injuries to his lower spine at the Wimbledon Internationale in a clash with Ove Fundin. Although he returned to racing the same season, his subsequent form suffered at this level and, with further injuries, he retired at the end of the 1968 season. In eight seasons at Cradley he averaged close to ten points per match. He was a regular holder of the Silver Sash, the Provincial League match race championship.
Brown died in 2005. A trophy named in his honour was contested in a challenge match between the successors to two of his former clubs, the Leicester Lions and the Dudley Heathens, in 2011.

Kivlemøyane

Kivlemøyane, (English: The Kivle Maids), is the popular name of three dairy maids in Seljord, Telemark, who was turned to stone according to legend. Their image is presented in a natural formation in the mountain of Skorve in the valley Kivledalen. To the legend is also a number of Norwegian folk tunes.
The legend.
This known Norwegian legend tells of three maids, who played their clarions during mass. Their music was so beautiful that all the attendants were distracted, and went out to listen to them instead of the priest. This angered the priest, who cursed the girls and turned them to stone. They are still visible in the mountain. After some sources, this happened in late catholic times, and the priest involved was the last catholic parson in Seljord.
The legend presents an orphic theme, and also indicates that the maids may have been fairies (Hulderpeople). It is also related to the legends of the Stanton Drew stone circles.
Music connected to the legend.
There are a number of folk tunes and dance tunes connected to this legend. In Seljord, a regular suite was performed and preserved, consisting of four separate tunes. The music was played on bort willow pipe and hardanger fiddle. Most of this music derives from Seljord, and is played in unbroken tradition from fiddlers there. Many of the dances are fairly old. Edvard Grieg has arranged one of those dances for piano, and Eivind Groven played and arranged another. There is in all some twelve to fifteen tunes sorted in three separate suites connected to the legend.
References.
The legend was first recorded by Andreas Faye, who published the first collection of Norwegian tales and legends in 1837. Later, versions of the tale is recorded by a number of folklorists, among then Magnus Brostrup Landstad, Rikard Berge and Knut Loupedalen. This version is from a collection of Norwegian folk tales and legends dated 1995 (Det Norske Samlaget). The folk tunes connected to the story is collected by Eivind Groven and Arne Bjørndal, as well as Johan Halvorsen.

FV Ekawat Nava 5

FV "Ekawat Nava 5" was a hijacked Kiribati-flagged, Thai-owned deep sea fishing trawler that was sunk by of the Indian Navy on 18 November 2008. The trawler sank when a fire broke out on the vessel after "INS Tabar" retaliated to being fired upon by pirates on board. All but one crew member of the trawler were believed killed.
Accounts of the incident.
The "Ekawat Nava 5" had a crew of 15 Thais and one Cambodian. It was traveling from Oman to Yemen when it was hijacked on November 18, 2008.
On the evening of November 18, "INS Tabar" was on patrol southwest of Salalah, Oman (near ), when it spotted the hijacked trawler. The vessel was identified by the frigate as a pirate mother ship, as it had two speed boats in tow and men armed with rocket-propelled grenades (RPG) and assault rifles on its deck. The frigate ordered the trawler to be boarded for inspection. Upon being refused and threatened by the pirates, the frigate continued to follow the trawler.
The official account from the Indian Navy states that the pirates fired at the frigate with an RPG. The frigate fired back in retaliation. Explosions were later heard on board the trawler, possibly due to ammunition or fuel stored on its deck. The trawler sank as a result of the fire.
The Indian Navy reported that following the fire on board the vessel, it spotted only the two speed boats fleeing from the scene. It pursued the boats and found one abandoned. It lost track of the other boat in the darkness.
An account of the incident narrated by the Thai representative of its owner, Sirichai Fisheries, based on information provided by a surviving Thai crew member, states that Somali pirates had boarded and just taken control of the trawler when "INS Tabar" arrived on the scene. The crew member's account stated that the trawler had not been used as a pirate mother ship.
Of the original crew members of the trawler, the one survivor was picked up by a passing merchant vessel, one was later confirmed dead, while 14 others were reported missing by the owner. The crew of "INS Tabar" reported seeing only the two motor boats fleeing from the scene of the incident in the darkness. They did not spot any of the original crew of the trawler. The fate of the remaining crew was unknown.
An account of the incident from the U.S. Department of State, may have originally stated that the Indian Navy captured some of the pirates. This was however not confirmed by the Indian Navy.

<doc id="20462548" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20462548" title="Romantic Pieces (Dvořák)">
Romantic Pieces (Dvořák)

Antonín Dvořák composed his cycle of four Romantic Pieces (in Czech: "Romantické kusy") for violin and piano (Op. 75, B. 150) in January 1887. These four pieces are arranged from his previous composition, a trio for two violins and viola, known as Miniatures (in Czech: "Drobnosti"), (Op. 75a, B. 149).
Background.
The composer's family was living in that time in Prague 2, 564, Žitná Street, in the same house as Dvořák's mother-in-law. She hired out a room to a young chemistry student, Josef Kruis. Kruis was also an amateur violinist who studied the violin with Jan Pelikán, a member of the orchestra of the National Theatre in Prague. They often played violin duets together. Dvořák, a viola player, heard them and got the idea to compose a new chamber work for two violins and viola in order to play with them. The resulting composition was the "Terzetto in C Major", Op.74, B.148, composed from 7 to 14 January 1887. It was, however, too difficult for Kruis, and Dvořák therefore composed another trio, but considerably simpler. The second trio, "Miniatures", was written in four movements, which he entitled: "Cavatina", "Capriccio", "Romance" and "Elegy" ("Ballad"). In the letter dated 18 January 1887 to his German publisher Simrock, Dvořák stated: ""I am writing little miniatures — just imagine — for two violins and viola, and I enjoy the work as much as if I were writing a large symphony — what do you say to that? Of course, they are meant rather for amateurs, but didn't Beethoven and Schumann also express themselves sometimes with quite simple means — and how?..."" Though he was apparently satisfied with this version of the trio, he nevertheless immediately began to rearrange it for violin and piano. He called the new version "Romantic Pieces", Op. 75. The only date appears at the end of the manuscript — 25 January 1887. Dvořák later completely forgot about the existence of the trio, and years later in 1901 explained to Simrock that ""...what is supposed to be a trio...cannot be the Romantic Pieces"". Dvořák's original manuscript of the trio version (and Kruis' copy of individual parts) was only rediscovered in 1938, and it was proven that he himself was mistaken.
The first performance of the "Romantic Pieces" took place on 30 March 1887 at the chamber concert at the "Umělecká beseda" in Prague. The violin part played by Karel Ondříček, at that time leader of the orchestra of the National Theatre (he was a younger brother of the legendary violinist František Ondříček), with Antonín Dvořák at the piano. The trio version was premiered by members of the "Prague Quartet" on 24 February 1938 at a concert of Dvořák's chamber music at the Prague City Library. The individual parts played by Vilibald Schwejda, Herbert Berger and Ladislav Černý.
The "Romantic Pieces" were published in 1887 by the Berlin publishing house of Simrock, the "Miniatures" in 1945 by Hudební Matice Umělecké Besedy.
Structure.
Miniatures, trio for two violins and viola.
Originally the set was untitled, but Dvořák called it "Miniatures" in the aforementioned letter to Simrock. Kruis added the titles to the individual movements, apparently in agreement with the composer. Dvořák completed the cycle of four non-related little pieces with different themes, with apparent influence of Robert Schumann. A performance of the four pieces would take approximately 14 minutes.
The first movement opens in the calm mood of the first violin; only in the middle part is the expression more passionate. The movement is accompanied with a rhythmical ostinato in the second violin and with a "bass" accompaniment in the viola. The second movement is written in an optimistic mood, with simple harmonic variations. It also contains some reminiscences of folk music, particularly at the end. The shape and mood of the third movement is rather dreamy. The melodic line of the first violin is accompanied by triplets in the second violin. The last movement is the most complicated; its elegic mood develops from short opening passage. Dvořák probably intended to create another movement, but it was unfinished, only eight bars are preserved. The whole composition ends with a slow movement, which is rather atypical.
Romantic pieces for violin and piano.
Dvořák left the musical content of the arrangement for violin and piano almost unchanged; he only slightly altered the harmonic foundations in the first movement (bars 30–36), and extended the end of the third movement with an additional four bars. He also renamed the second and third movements.

Gurkha Justice Campaign

The Gurkha Justice Campaign is a campaign group in the United Kingdom fighting for the rights of the Gurkhas. 
It wants the Gurkhas who fought for the UK to gain the same rights as their British and Commonwealth counterparts. Essentially the group wants the law to be changed so that all Gurkhas who fought for the UK will gain a right of abode, whereas under previous legislation they only had a right of abode if they retired after 1997. They took their case to the high court, and have the support of a number of celebrities including perhaps most famously Joanna Lumley.
Background.
Until 2004 Gurkhas were not allowed to settle in the United Kingdom. However, the Labour government under Tony Blair changed the rules so that Gurkhas who retired after 1997 would be allowed to settle in the UK, 1997 being the date when the Gurkha Brigade headquarters moved from Hong Kong to Britain. Soldiers who retired before this date, however, were only allowed the same settlement rights in exceptional circumstance. The Gurkha Justice Campaign wanted the same settlement rights for all Gurkha soldiers.
In 2008, the high court ruled that the policy had been illegal since the process used to determine pre-1997 applications was deemed arbitrary. The Government of Gordon Brown agreed to produce new rules. However, when these were unveiled on 24 April 2009, the Gurkhas were furious because there was no automatic right to settle in the UK for all veterans. Indeed, Gurkhas who wanted to settle in the UK would have to meet one or more of five requirements. These were;
Campaigners claimed that under the rules, only around 100 Gurkhas would qualify for residence, although the government figures suggested that as many as 4,300 would be eligible to settle. The rules would disqualify many from being able to settle in the United Kingdom, as indicated by an article which appeared in "The Economist":
Veterans would be allowed to settle only if they met one or more conditions based on length of service, gallantry or related illness. Many of the requirements seemed designed to frustrate: for example, one way to qualify automatically was by soldiering for at least 20 years, though most rank-and-file Gurkhas serve for only 15. Another was to prove that a long-term medical condition was caused or worsened by active service—a tall order for those whose injuries were sustained decades ago.
The campaign is also supported by the Liberal Democrats.
Joanna Lumley and the Gurkhas.
In 2008 the actress Joanna Lumley, whose father served in the 6th Gurkha Rifles, became the public face of the campaign to provide all Gurkha veterans who served in the British Army before 1997 the right to settle in Britain, and ran a highly publicised and successful campaign. Those serving after 1997 had already been granted permission but the UK Government has not extended the offer to all of the Gurkhas, who are natives of Nepal. They have served Britain for almost 200 years with over 50,000 dying in service, and 13 have been awarded the Victoria Cross. On 20 November 2008, Lumley led a large all party group including Gurkhas starting from Parliament Square to 10 Downing Street with a petition signed by 250,000 people. She supports the Gurkha Justice Campaign. On 24 April 2009 she stated that she was "ashamed" of the UK administration's decision to affix five criteria to the Gurkhas' right to settle in the UK. With the support of both Opposition parties and Labour rebel MPs on 29 April 2009 a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas be offered an equal right of residence was passed, allowing Gurkhas who served before 1997 residence in the UK. Following the Government defeat, the Minister for Immigration Phil Woolas announced that a further review would be completed by the middle of July. 
On 5 May Joanna Lumley said that she had received private assurances of support from a senior member of the Royal Family, and attended a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street the following day. Afterwards she described the meeting as "extremely positive", and praised Brown, saying, "I trust him. I rely on him. And I know that he has now taken this matter into his own hands and so today is a very good day".
However, on the day following the meeting with Brown, five Gurkha veterans who had applied for residency in the United Kingdom received letters telling them that their appeals had been rejected. Lumley confronted Phil Woolas at the BBC Westminster studios about the issue and, after pursuing him around the studio, the pair held an inpromptu press conference in which she pressured him into agreeing to further talks over the issue.
Following a Commons Home Affairs Committee meeting in which talks were held between campaigners, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office on 19 May, Gordon Brown announced to the House of Commons on 20 May that the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith would make a statement on the issue the following day. Smith subsequently announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain.

Serenianus

Serenianus (died in Lydia, 366) was an officer of the Roman Empire, involved in the death of Caesar Constantius Gallus and in the usurpation of Procopius.
Biography.
Serenianus was born in Pannonia. attended at the court of Roman Emperor Constantius II (337-361). It is known that he had been a former general, in charge of the defence of Phoenicia, whose laxity had been the reason for the devastation of the city of Celsein. He was put under trial for treason: he had sent one of his men with an enchanted hat to ask oracles on the Emperor's life. However, even if the charge was demonstrated, he was declared not guilty, thanks to his friends.
In 354 he was sent to Pula, where Caesar Constantius Gallus was under trial for treason, to tell the prisoner that he had been condemned to death; then, together with Apodemius and Pentadius, he executed the Caesar.
In 364, Emperor Valentinian I proclaimed his brother Valens co-emperor.The two rulers divided among themselves the army and the officers. In this occasion, Serenianus, who had been returned to the reserve for long time, entered at Valens' service as "comes domesticorum" ("commander of the imperial bodyguard").
In 366 he was killed by Marcellus, "protector" of usurper Procopius, who, in 365, rebelled against Emperor Valens. The story is told differently by the two sources survived, Ammianus Marcellinus and Zosimus.
According to Ammianus, Serenianus stayed loyal to Valens. That year Serenianus went to Cyzicus, where he found that an imperial officer called Venustus had brought in that city, for fear of the usurper, the money to pay the troops; Serenianus, confident in the city garrison and in the strength of the city walls, fortified in Cizycus. To obtain that money, Procopius collected a strong army and put under siege Cyzicus, capturing the city and Serenianus, who was sent, as a prisoner, to Nicaea. After Procopius was killed, Marcellus, who was in command of the garrison of Nicaea, during the night entered the Palace, where Serenianus was held, and killed him.
According to Zosimus, who follows Eunapius, Serenianus was in Bithynia, leading some cavalry units, and Procopius sent Marcellinus to Bithynia to neutralize this menace. Serenianus occupied Cyzicus, but Marcellinus put under siege and captured the city, pursued the fleeing Serenianus in Lydia and killed him.
Ammianus had a mad opinion of Serenianus, whom he describes rude and cruel, and says that Marcellus' only merit was to have killed Serenianus and saved thus many lives, as Serenianus, once free, would have damaged many people.

Under 15 Bayernliga

The Under 15 Bayernliga (German: "C-Jugend Bayernliga") is the highest level of competition for under 15 football teams in Bavaria and the second tier of the Southern German league system, set below the "Under 15 Regionalliga Süd".
History.
The competition was established in 1975, as a championship rather than a league, alongside the Bavarian Under 17 championship. Since then, the winner of the competition is determined by an on-off final.
To qualify for the championship, a club had win one of the seven "Bezirksoberligas" in Bavaria, the highest football leagues at this level and age.
The seven champions played a quarter final round with home-and-away games, whereby six clubs are drawn against each other for three games. The three winners plus the team that had a bye in this round reach the semi-finals, now played at a neutral ground. The two semi-finals winner enter the Bavarian championship final. Semi-final and final are held on the same weekend and location.
There is no national German championship at this level but an Under 15 Southern German championship exists since 1979, where the regional champions of Bavaria, Württemberg, North Baden, South Baden and Hesse compete.
Below this level, at the under 13 (German: "D-Jugend"), no Bavarian championship exists. The under 15 level is currently, as of 2008, the highest level of play where clubs like FC Bayern Munich and 1. FC Nuremberg still compete with their first teams at state level.
In 2008, the Bavarian football association had 2,630 registered under 15 teams, a marginal increase from the previous year. All up, 20,699 junior teams were registered with the "BFV" in 2008
Since 1994, a knock-out cup competition, the "Bau Pokal", is also played.
Bayernliga.
In 2005, following the example of the under 19 and under 17 "Bayernligas", two regional leagues, north and south, were formed. From then on, the two league winners would meet in the Bavarian final. The northern division operates with 14, the southern with 12 clubs. This difference results from the fact that the north has four "Bezirksoberligas" as the leagues below while the south only has three.
The bottom four clubs in the north and the bottom three clubs in the south are relegated while the seven "Bezirksoberliga" champions earn direct promotion. In 2008, there were five clubs promoted to the northern division due to SV Memmelsdorf withdrawing at the end of season.
In the 2006-07 season, FC Bayern Munich remained unbeaten throughout the league season, winning the Bavarian final, too, ending the season with 18 wins and five draws.
In the 2007-08 season, Bayern Munich remained unbeaten throughout the league season again, only losing the final to 1. FC Nuremberg. "1. FCN" in turn only lost one regular season game, drew one and won all 24 others.
On 24 September 2008, with a 0-1 loss to TSV 1860 Munich in the 2008-09 seasons first round, Bayern Munichs unbeaten run of 44 league games came to an end. Previously, the club had lost 0-2 in the league on 10 June 2006 to TSV 1860 Rosenheim in the last round of the 2005-06 season.
Regionalliga.
In October 2008, the Southern German football federation decided that, from 2010 onwards, an "Under 15 Regionalliga South" would be established, a step similar to what had been taken for the under 19 in 1996 and the under 17 in 2000. "Regionalligas" already exist in the two regions west and north and the south was concerned it would fall behind. After a lengthy debate, 86 of 131 delegates voted for the new league which will include five clubs from Bavaria, alongside clubs from Hesse and Baden-Württemberg. In this vote, the delegates from Baden-Württemberg, where a united "Oberliga" already exists since 2008, voted against while the other two regions plus the delegates from the professional clubs voted for the proposal.
Geography.
Below the "Bayernliga", there is seven "Bezirksoberligas", roughly organised within the boundaries of the seven Bavarian "Regierungsbezirke", these being:
Champions.
Winners & Finalists.
As of 2013, this is the standing in the all-time winners list:

Great Big Mouth Records is a record label based in Des Moines, Iowa, which was founded by Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor and Denny Harvey. The label was conceived to help bring attention to Midwestern bands, Taylor explains; "basically we're just trying to unify the scene and really bring more attention to the Midwest than there is right now.".
History.
The label was launched in Des Moines, Iowa in 2006. Great Big Mouth Records was initially conceived while Corey Taylor was producing local band Facecage's album "Facecage III" and was the result of the lack of major-label interest in Midwestern bands. Taylor explains; "If I've learned anything, it's that the industry has to be led by the fucking hand to what kind of music people want. And that's what we’re trying to do." The label was described as "grass-roots yet high-tech" by Denny Harvey (Facecage's manager and label co-founder), he also went on to explain that; "eventually, we hope to make a big enough dent to secure major distribution. Until then, we will focus on Internet sales and independent promotion." Facecage are the only band on the label's roster and Taylor says he currently has no plans to add to it. In 2008 Taylor began working with Facecage on a second album, which was due for release in 2010.

SM U-20 (Austria-Hungary)

SM "U-20 or U-XX" was the lead boat of the of submarines or U-boats built for and operated by the Austro-Hungarian Navy () during the First World War. The design for "U-20" was based on submarines of the Royal Danish Navy's "Havmanden" class (three of which had been built in Austria-Hungary), and was largely obsolete by the beginning of the war.
"U-20" was just over long and was armed with two bow torpedo tubes, a deck gun, and a machine gun. "U-20" had no wartime successes and was sunk in early July 1918 by the Italian submarine "F-12". The wreck of "U-20" was located in 1962 and salvaged. A portion of her conning tower is on display in a military museum in Vienna.
Design and construction.
When it became apparent to the Austro-Hungarian Navy that the First World War would not be a short war, they moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for Denmark's "Havmanden" class submarines, three of which had been built at Whitehead & Co. in Fiume. Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete, it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards. The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for "U-20" and her three sister boats on 27 March 1915.
"U-20" was one of two boats of the class to be built at the Pola Navy Yard. Due to demands by the Hungarian government, subcontracts for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, but this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design and resulted in numerous modifications and delays for the class in general.
"U-20" was an ocean-going submarine that displaced surfaced and submerged and was designed for a complement of 18. She was long with a beam of and a draft of . For propulsion, she featured a single propeller shaft, a single diesel engine for surface running, and a single electric motor for submerged travel. She was capable of while surfaced and while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for "U-20", the "Havmanden" class, upon which the "U-20" class was based, had a range of at , surfaced, and at submerged.
"U-20" was armed with two torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. She was also equipped with a 66 mm/26 (2.6 in) deck gun and an machine gun.
"U-20" was laid down on 29 September 1915, six months after she was ordered, and was launched on 18 September 1916.
Service career.
Upon completion, "U-20" began diving trials. On her 15 March 1917 trial, she was accidentally rammed by in the Fasana Channel. The collision with the Austro-Hungarian light cruiser twisted "U-20"s periscope, extensively damaged the conning tower, and knocked off her deck gun. After seven months of reconstruction, "U-20" was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 20 October.
After initially operating out of Pola, "U-20" was transferred to Trieste in February 1918. Over the next three months, the U-boat patrolled in the northern Adriatic between the Tagliamento estuary and Venice. "U-20" had an encounter with an enemy submarine on 7 April but was not able to successfully launch an attack.
On 3 July, "Linienschiffsleutnant" Ludwig Müller sailed "U-20" out from Trieste for the Gulf of Venice. A day later, "U-20" was spotted by the Italian submarine "F-12", which was on patrol in the northern Adriatic. "F-12" initially pursued "U-20" underwater, and then on the surface. At a range of , "F-12" torpedoed "U-20" at position , sinking her with all hands. There was no wreckage on the surface, only an oil slick. Like all of her sister boats, "U-20" had no wartime successes.
In mid 1962, the wreck of "U-20" was discovered in the northern Adriatic. Italian salvage crews raised the boat's rear portion on 22 July and her front section on 21 November. The conning tower and a small midships section of "U-20" were donated to the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum in Vienna, where they are on display, while the rest of the boat was scrapped. The remains of the crewmen were buried on the grounds of the Theresian Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt.

The shrine is situated on the waterfront of the Kanmon Strait, between the centre of Shimonoseki and the tourist restaurants of Karato, Kanmon Wharf. The bright red main gate makes it a very visible sight.
Description.
The colours and style of the gate are inspired by Ryūgū-jō, according to the Shimonoseki Tourist Guidebook published by the Shimonoseki City Tourism Department. This source states that Antoku's grandmother, Nii-no-Ama, who drowned with Antoku, wished for their palace to be created underwater as she jumped into the sea. Ryūgū-jō is a mythical underwater palace, belonging to the dragon god of the sea. In the Tale of Heike, Nii-no-Ama told Antoku, before jumping, that they would go to an underwater palace, without referring to Ryūgū-jō. Then, Antoku's mother (Kenreimon-In, aka Taira no Tokuko) had a dream, in which they were living in Ryūgū-jō.
Inside, in the Hoichi Hall, is a statue of Hoichi the Earless, one of the characters in a traditional ghost story which was made known in the west by Lafcadio Hearn.
The grounds also contain the Nanamori-zuka (seven mounds), which represent the Heike warriors also lost in the Battle of Dan-no-Ura.

Kawakaze-class destroyer

The were a class of two destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The class is sometimes referred to as the "Tanikaze" class in some sources; however, "Tanikaze" was launched and commissioned later than "Kawakaze".
Background.
Construction of the new "Kawakaze"-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's 8-4 Fleet Program in fiscal 1915. A large destroyer with long range, capable of providing escort to the new battleship and the two s were considered a part of this reduced spending naval program from the previous Eight-eight fleet project..
Although funding was authorized for only one destroyer, "Tanikaze", the Italian government unexpectedly refunded Japan for its down payment of 870,000 Yen on the , which had been transferred to the Royal Italian Navy before completion in England during World War I. These funds were used to complete a second vessel, which was also named "Kawakaze".
Design.
Initially conceived of as a follow-on version of the earlier s, however, it was the first to use the new Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval guns that were to be used many subsequent classes of Japanese destroyers. In addition, given the experience with deployment of Japanese destroyers for extended periods overseas in World War I, the hull and bow needed to be reinforced to handle heavy seas. Furthermore, the navy wanted to add the latest technologies in terms of the new 533 mm torpedoes in three double launchers.
It was furthermore decided to use the same Brown-Curtis heavy fuel oil fired geared steam turbine engines as on the "Tenryū"-class cruisers. The result was a ship was much more powerful that the earlier "Isokaze" class, and capable of high speed operation.
Operational history.
The "Kawakaze"-class destroyers served during the interwar period. "Kawakaze" was retired on April 1, 1934 and "Tanikaze" a year later.

Abingdon Motorcycles was a British motorcycle manufacturer in Tyseley, 
Birmingham between 1903 and 1925. The tool and chain manufacturers Abingdon Engineering was founded in 1856 and started making motorcycles in 1903, when the industry was still very new, with engines from a number of manufacturers before the company developed their own "Abingdon" four-stroke 350 cc single and 794 cc V-twin engines, which were used by Ariel and Invicta. Much of the production was exported to the Commonwealth countries. One innovation introduced by Abingdon was the first telescopic shock absorber. Motorcycles of the day often had no front suspension or some form of springs, but Abingdon devised the "Abingdon Spring Fork", a coil sprung, telescopic shock absorber.
The First World War halted production but they continued in 1919 with the V-twin and 499 cc and 623 cc single cylinder motorcycles. 
The company was renamed AKD (Abingdon King Dick) in 1926 and concentrated production on 147cc to 346cc single cylinder motorcycles until 1933, when they decided to concentrate on their successful range of "King Dick" mechanics tools.
King Dick tools.

Neide Núria de Sousa Van-Dúnem Vieira (born July 4, 1986), also known as Neide, is a popular Angolan contemporary singer, songwriter, and film/television actress. Born and raised in 
Luanda, Angola, Neide started her acting career in local theater in 2003, at the age of 17, being cast in the television soap "Sede de Viver" a year later. Her singing career officially began in 2007 with the release of the hit single "Olá Baby" in the compilation album "Eu e Elas (vol 1)", a song for which the video reached the number two spot on the MTV Africa Video Chart.
Early life.
Neide was born on July 4, 1986, in Luanda, Angola and is the only child of José António Vieira and Isabel Maria de Fátima Sousa Van-Dúnem, although she has three half-brothers and six half-sisters. Neide's interest in music came at a very early age although it was as an actress at age 17 that she would have her first encounter with fame. But she eventually broke into the music scene in 2007 with the release of the hit single "Olá Baby".
Recording career.
2006-2007: "Olá Baby".
In collaboration with producer Caló Pascoal, Neide's initial venture into the music business came in the form of a duet with the producer on the song "Olá Baby", the lead single of the compilation album "Eu e Elas (vol 1)" released on April 29, 2007. The song's commercial success launched Neide's singing career and established her as a "double threat" in the entertainment business (singing and acting).
2008-2009: "Teu Marido Casou/Esta Noite".
Neide decided to put her acting career on hold to venture forth as an independent artist and started working on her debut solo album, writing all of its tracks. The music styles she employed were primarily Kizomba and Semba but the influence of R&B is strong. "Teu Marido Casou (com outra)" was the first song to get radio play, to be later released as a CD single along with the song "Esta Noite". The full album was scheduled to be released in the second half of 2009 but its release was postponed.

<doc id="20463472" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20463472" title="Flak corps">
Flak corps

A flak corps () was a massed anti-aircraft (AA) artillery formation employed by the "Luftwaffe" for anti-aircraft, antitank, and fire support operations in World War II. A "Flakkorps" was a flexible organization that was made up of a varying number of AA regiments, brigades, or divisions. It was roughly equivalent in strength to a brigade or a division. A total of six flak corps were organized by Germany during the war. The flak corps, while mainly intended to support ground units with concentrated anti-aircraft fire, in many cases provided also antitank support.
History.
Flak corps did not exist before World War II. Until the end of war Germany eventually organized a total of six flak corps, being numbered I - VI, plus one short-lived special flak corps.
Flak corps I and II were formed on 3 October 1939. They grouped mobile AA battalions (previously existing) to overwhelmingly concentrate the firepower at points of decision on the battlefield. The original two flak corps were used in the Battle of France in 1940, and later inactivated. They were reorganized for the German invasion of Russia and fought for the remainder of the war on the Eastern Front. The I Flak Corps was destroyed at Stalingrad and later formed again.
The III Flak Corps was formed in February 1944 and fought on the Western Front. In total, III Flak Corps entered combat in Normandy with 27 heavy batteries, 26 light batteries and some 12,000 men. During the fighting in Normandy in 1944, the III Flak Corps was motorized although not all authorized vehicles were present. It was eventually destroyed in the Ruhr Pocket in April 1945.
The IV Flak Corps was formed in July 1944 and supported Army Group G on the Western Front until it surrendered in May 1945.
The V Flak Corps was formed in November 1944 and fought in Hungary and Austria.
The VI Flak Corps was formed in February 1945 and fought in northern Germany in support of the 1st Parachute Army.
The flak corps "for special employment" ("Flakkorps z.b.V.") was organized in 1945 to control V-weapons.
Organization.
Flak corps were large organizations of pre-existing AA units (regiments, brigades, and divisions) rather than being formed as new units from scratch. In 1943 Allied intelligence noted:
"The Flak Corps is a wartime organization, and constitutes an operational reserve of the commander in chief of the German Air Force. It combines great mobility with heavy fire power. It can be employed in conjunction with spearheads composed of armored and motorized forces, and with nonmotorized troops in forcing river crossings and attacking fortified positions. It can also be deployed as highly mobile artillery to support tank attacks."
Flak corps did not include the majority of the Germany's flak force. Even considering only the "Luftwaffe's" flak units dedicated to direct support of "Wehrmacht" ground troops, most of them were not subordinated to flak corps.
Flak corps were either partially motorized or fully motorized, depending on the degree of motorization of their subordinate units.
The following orders of battle depict typical flak corps organizations in 1940 and 1944:
II Flak Corps, August 1, 1940:
III Flak Corps, June 6, 1944:
Assessment.
Although the AA guns of all nations in World War II could be used against ground targets, Germany in particular used AA guns in multiple roles. The need for command and control of these assets led to the organization of larger units, culminating with the organization of flak corps. Although the Soviets also organized large air defense units, they were typically not used against ground targets. The flak corps above all provided additional antitank support for the German ground forces. In some cases, such as at Cagny in Normandy, these units achieved significant success against attacking Allied armored vehicles. The use of flak corps as ground warfare assets was complicated because they were part of the air force ("Luftwaffe") chain of command even when supporting ground forces (either "Heer" or "Waffen SS").
Given the expense of producing AA guns – in relation to the cost of antitank guns of the same capabilities – it is questionable if their use as antitank weapons was economical.
As an organizational form, massed AA-gun formations represented a dead-end as large-caliber AA guns were phased out of military service in the 1950s and replaced by surface to air missiles.

Rock, Northumberland

Rock is a village in Northumberland, England about north of Alnwick.
The single street has on one side cottages and gardens; on the other, an ornamental lake. At the end is a little Norman church; and beyond that, the battlements and towers of Rock Hall. The sundial and the inscribed stone in the end wall of the schoolroom were originally part of a residence of the Salkelds which stood on the site. The Hall was then their seat – their coat of arms still remains above an old, blocked doorway to the right of the modern entrance. Later a branch of the Fenwicks lived here. It was a John Fenwick of Rock that was hanged for the murder of Mr. Ferdinando Forster at the White Cross, Newgate Street, Newcastle, in 1701.
The Hall dates to the 12th or 13th centuries. The south wing was converted into a defensible tower house in the late 14th or early 15th century, the whole was remodelled in the 17th century, but the house was left ruinous by a fire in 1752, before being restored and extended by Charles Bosanquet in the 19th century.
The same Charles Bosanquet also restored the church. The west door of this splendid little edifice is a rich piece of original Norman work. The gargoyles are noteworthy. The memorial brass within to Colonel John Salkeld does not mention that the worthy colonel killed a Swinburne of Capheaton near the gates of Meldon and only just escaped hanging.
Governance.
Rock is in the parliamentary constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed.
Religious sites.
The church is dedicated to St Philip and St James.

The Beach Soccer Worldwide Beach Soccer Rankings are rankings for international beach soccer teams put together by BSWW and FIFA after FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups have taken place. An individual rankings table for European nations also exists.
FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup rankings table.
Scoring points.
The nations are ranked based on their participation in the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups between 2005 and 2011 with the most successful teams being ranked highest on the table. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of games played at the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups. Three points for a win in normal time, two points for a win in extra-time or penalties and no points for a loss. Therefore the points each nations has earned are worked out using this formula:
Sometimes two of the teams will have the same amount of points but one will be in a higher position than the other. This occurs as one team has achieved the same amount of points as the other in a fewer number of games. Teams that have not taken part in a world cup cannot score points, even 0, and therefore are not counted in the rankings table. The next time the table will be updated is after the 2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.

Scoring points.
The other rankings table is the European rankings table specifically for European nations. The points system used to rank nations in this table is much different than the system used to rank the world cup nations. Points are earned through nations competing in continental tournaments throughout the year. These points are then added to 70% of the amount of points earned in the previous year and 40% of the amount of points earned in the year before that. Therefore, to work out the points earned for nations at the end of 2010, this would be the formula used:
These rankings are then used to seed the teams in Beach Soccer Worldwide competitions in the following year.
Rankings.
The following table is the rankings table after all competitions in 2010. This table will affect seeds in 2011 UEFA beach soccer competitions. A red block indicates that that nation did not compete in that beach soccer season and therefore earned zero points.
