Reverend (band)

Reverend is an American heavy metal band that was originally based in Seattle, Washington, and is based in San Antonio, Texas. Reverend was formed in 1989 by ex-Metal Church vocalist David Wayne, who took the band's name from his own moniker, which he acquired as the frontman of the "Metal Church". Reverend has gone through many lineup versions since its original inception, and despite David Wayne's death in 2005, the band is still active and continues to play in his honor.
History.
After struggling with drug problems within his current band, David Wayne decided to leave Metal Church in the late '80's and find another group to join. Wayne searched around Los Angeles looking for the best band in which he could participate. He met with ex-W.A.S.P. member Randy Piper and considered joining Piper's band Animal, but Wayne decided against it because Animal was experiencing the same problems which caused his departure from Metal Church.
Around this time, Heretic, the band whose singer recently left to replace Wayne in Metal Church, called David Wayne repeatedly and urged him to at least listen to their songs. Despite being reluctant at first, Wayne eventually met with the members of Heretic at a Denny's restaurant where they played him some of their songs on a tape recorder. Wayne was impressed, and decided that they were the right band for him, thus laying the foundation of Reverend. Wayne later described this ironic episode as a "cosmic joke" on everyone involved.

Liangpi

Liangpi () is a noodle-like Chinese dish made from wheat or rice flour. It is a specialty dish originating from the Chinese province of Shaanxi, but has now spread to many other places in China, in particular the northern and central regions. Although liangpi is served cold, they are served in every season, including winter.
New York Times' Julia Moskin describes liangpi as served at Xi'an Famous Foods as "a dish of cold noodles in a sauce that hits every possible flavor category (sweet, tangy, savory, herbal, nutty and dozens of others)."
Preparation.
Liangpi literally means "cold skin", although it has no animal products in it at all. There are several ways of making liangpi: 
First, wheat or rice flour is turned into a soft dough by adding water and a little bit of salt. Then, the dough is put in a bowl, water is added and the dough has to be "rinsed" until the water is saturated with starch from the dough, turning into a muddy white color. The remainder of the dough is now removed, and the bowl is left to rest overnight at a cool place to allow the dissolved starch to precipitate.
The following day, there will be a kind of starch-paste on the bottom of the bowl, with a more or less clear liquid on top, which has to be discarded. Once the liquid has been removed, a small amount of the paste can then be poured into a flat plate or tray, and spread evenly in a thin layer. The whole plate is placed into a large pot full of boiling water, where it is steamed for a couple of minutes, and the resulting "pancake" cut into long pieces vaguely resembling noodles.
Types.
Hanzhong Liangpi (汉中凉皮).
Hanzhong Liangpi (汉中凉皮) or "Hanzhong Mianpi (汉中面皮)", named for the city of Hanzhong in southwestern Shaanxi, are steamed liangpi with garlic and hot chili oil.
Majiang Liangpi (麻酱凉皮).
Majiang Liangpi (麻酱凉皮) are liangpi garnished with julienned cucumber and a sauce made of salt, vinegar, hot chili oil and especially black sesame paste, for which it is named ("Majiang (麻酱)" is the Chinese name for sesame paste).
Shan Xin Gan Mianpi.
Shan Xin Gan Mianpi is another type of Liangpi, which tastes a bit firmer and looks darker in color compared other to other Liangpi. It is always served with Mianjin, vinegar, chilli oil, salt, mashed garlic in water and bean sprout.

<doc id="20370997" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20370997" title="Sbrk">
Sbrk

brk and sbrk are basic memory management system calls used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems to control the amount of memory allocated to the data segment of the process. These calls are typically made from a higher-level memory management library such as malloc. In the original Unix system, brk and sbrk were the only ways in which applications could acquire additional data space; later versions allowed this to also be done using the mmap call.
Description.
The brk and sbrk calls dynamically change the amount of space allocated for the data segment of the calling process. The change is made by resetting the program break of the process, which determines the maximum space that can be allocated. The program break is the address of the first location beyond the current end of the data region. The amount of available space increases as the break value increases. The available space is initialized to a value of zero. The break value can be automatically rounded up to a size appropriate for the memory management architecture.
Function signatures and behavior.
The brk subroutine sets the program break value to the value of the end_data_segment parameter and changes the amount of available space accordingly.
The sbrk subroutine adds to the program break value the number of bytes contained in the increment parameter and changes the amount of available space accordingly. The increment parameter can be a negative number, in which case the amount of available space is decreased.
Upon successful completion, the brk subroutine returns a value of 0, and the sbrk subroutine returns the prior value of the program break (if the available space is increased the return value points to the start of the new area). If either subroutine is unsuccessful, a value of is returned and the errno global variable is set to indicate the error.
The current Mac OS X implementation of sbrk is an emulation, and has a maximum allocation of 4 Megabytes. When this limit is reached, −1 is returned and the errno is set to ENOMEM.
Error codes.
The error ENOMEM is set and the allocated space remains unchanged if one or more of the following are true:

Princeton Tigers football

The Princeton Tigers football program represents Princeton University college football at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA). Princeton’s football program -- along with the football program at nearby Rutgers University -- is the oldest in the world, these two schools having competed against each other in American football's first intercollegiate contest in 1869, and has a legacy that includes the most national championships of any college or university.
History.
First football game.
Students from The College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) traveled to New Brunswick, New Jersey on November 6, 1869 to play Rutgers College (now Rutgers University) in a new variant of rugby called football. Rutgers won the inaugural game 6 runs to 4 runs. A week later, Rutgers students traveled to Princeton, New Jersey for a rematch, which Princeton won. Since the teams split the two games series, they were both retroactively awarded a share of the national championship for the 1869 season.
Early history.
Due in part to their invention of the sport, the Tigers were one of the dominant forces in the early days of intercollegiate football, winning 22 of the first 40 national titles (between 1869 and 1909). As the sport transformed at the hands of figures like John Heisman and Yale’s Walter Camp and more schools began competing, Princeton and the rest of the Ivy League slowly faded out of national championship contention. The Tigers won their last national championship in 1950 when Dick Kazmaier, the 1951 Heisman Trophy winner, was a junior.
Formation of the Ivy League.
When Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale Universities, Dartmouth College, and the University of Pennsylvania formed the Ivy League athletic conference in 1955, conference rules prohibited post-season play in football. Princeton had always abstained from post-season play, but other future member schools had participated in bowls. The new policy further insulated Princeton and the Ivy League from the national spotlight. Despite an undefeated season in 1964, Princeton was not among the top 10 teams in the season-ending AP Poll.
NCAA Division I subdivision split.
The NCAA split Division I collegiate football into two subdivisions in 1978, then called I-A for larger schools, and I-AA for the smaller ones. The NCAA had devised the split, in part, with the Ivy League in mind, but the conference did not move down for 4 seasons. Unable to play competitively against long-time rival Rutgers anymore, Princeton stopped scheduling them as a football opponent after 1980. Then in 1982 the NCAA created a rule that stated a program’s average attendance must be at least 15,000 to qualify for I-A membership. This forced the conference’s hand, as only some of the member schools met the attendance qualification. Choosing to stay together rather than stand their ground separately in the increasingly competitive I-A subdivision, the Ivy League moved down into I-AA starting with the 1982 season. Despite often finishing its seasons ranked in the championship subdivision, Princeton cannot play in the NCAA Football Tournament per Ivy League rules.
Recent history.
Since the formation of the Ivy League, Princeton has achieved only moderate success on the gridiron, with nine Ivy League championships and 10 Big Three championships since 1955. Most recently, Princeton instituted a head coaching change as ten-year coach Roger Hughes was replaced by Cincinnati Bengals assistant offensive line coach Bob Surace. Surace played center at Princeton and graduated in 1990.
Stadia and facilities.
Palmer Stadium.
In 1914, Princeton built Palmer Stadium, the third college football stadium ever built and what was the second oldest standing college stadium until its demolition in 1996. Palmer Stadium was modeled after the Greek Olympic stadium and seated 45,750 spectators. In the 1990s the university decided to demolish it for a new stadium rather than undertake a long and expensive renovation process, as Harvard had with its stadium in 1984.
Princeton University Stadium.
During the construction of the new stadium, the Tigers played a season of nine away games, plus a homecoming game against Yale at Giants Stadium in 1997. Princeton University Stadium opened on September 19, 1998 and seats 27,773. After eight years of natural grass fields, FieldTurf artificial playing surface was installed for the 2006 football season and named "Powers Field" in honor of William C. Powers, Princeton class of 1979, who was an All-Ivy punter for the Tigers and donated $10 million to the football program that year.
Practice facilities.
The Finney-Campbell practice fields to the east of Princeton University Stadium have been outfitted with FieldTurf. They consist of nearly of playing surface, with two full football fields and lines for men’s and women’s lacrosse.

Eduard Meijers

Eduard Maurits Meijers (January 10, 1880, Den Helder – June 25, 1954 in Leiden) was a Dutch jurist of Jewish background, who was the founding father of the current Dutch civil code, the Nieuw Burgerlijk Wetboek.
Biography.
Family.
He was the son of Isidor Meijers, a naval phycisian, and Julie Wolff. Eduard married Tonij Gottschalk on August 12, 1909. The couple would get four daughters.
Career.
In 1897 Meijers entered the University of Amsterdam to study law. He finished his doctorate under Johannes Houwing in April 1903. His dissertation had an emphasis on philosophy, defending utilitarianism against Kant's rationalism and posing that in general well-being should be the final goal of every law institution.
After his studies he ran a law practice in Amsterdam. In 1910 he accepted a chair in private law and private international law at Leiden University. He was particularly interested in legal history and his publications were of great influence on the development of this field in the Netherlands. He became internationally recognized and received honorary degrees from the universities of Aberdeen, Brussels, Glasgow, Leuven, Lille and Paris. From 1918 to 1922 Meijers was dean of the law faculty in Leiden; in 1926 and 1927 he was rector of the university.
Second World War.
The firing of Meijers and other Jewish scientists in 1940 by the German occupiers led Meijers' former graduate student Rudolph Cleveringa to give a widely acclaimed and consequential protest address on November 26, 1940. On August 7, 1942, Meijers, his wife and their youngest daughter were deported to the Westerbork transit camp, where they remained in detention. In September 1944 he was transported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Bohemia. He survived the camps and returned to Leiden on June 25, 1945.
A new Dutch civil code.
On April 25, 1947, Meijers was asked by Royal Order to design a new civil code for the Netherlands (the Burgerlijk Wetboek) to replace the current code, which had been in place since 1838. In 1954, Meijers handed over the design for the first four books, accompanied with an extensive explanation. After Meijers' death that same year, his work was continued by Jan Drion, Jannes Eggens, Frits de Jong and Geert de Grooth. The first book of the new civil code was codified in 1970, the second in 1976. The last four of the seven books were codified only in 1992, 45 years after Meijers had started the work.

Devol (Albania)

Devol () also Deabolis or Diabolis, () was a medieval fortress and bishopric in western Macedonia, located south of Lake Ohrid in what is today the south-eastern corner of Albania (Devoll District). Its precise location is unknown today, but it is thought to have been located by the river of the same name (today Devoll River), and on the Roman Via Egnatia road. It is first mentioned in historical sources in John Skylitzes' account of the Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars under Emperor Basil II, whose general Eustathios Daphnomeles is said to have subdued some of the last Bulgarian resisting forces concentrated in Deabolis in 1018. The place is also mentioned in a 1019 charter granted by Basil to the Bulgarian church, as a "kastron" (castle) under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Kastoria. 
It is not precisely known when Deabolis became a bishopric. Saint Clement of Ohrid (ca. 840–916), an eminent early Bulgarian writer, is supposed to have been its bishop around 900, according to the saint's vita written by Theophylact of Ohrid some 200 years later; however, the first independent contemporary documents confirming its status as a bishopric are of a later date.
Deabolis/Devol was the site of the Treaty of Devol between Bohemond I of Antioch and Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos in 1108. It was reconquered by the Bulgarian Empire in the beginning of the 13th century. The fortress continued to play an important role until the 14th century. Its site became forgotten in modern times. It has been tentatively identified with the site of a modern Albanian village called Zvezdë (located at ), a conjecture already proposed by the 19th century British traveller William Martin Leake in 1835.
The place Deabolis/Devol on the Devoll river should not be confused with a different medieval fortress likewise called Deabolis, or Devolgrad, situated further east in today's Republic of Macedonia, near Kavadarci.

Reception.
The Allmusic review by Brian Olewnick awarded the album 4 stars stating "If anything, the length of the pieces allows Murray to drift on a bit longer than necessary at times. As often as not, though, he manages to wring out some extra juice, making it easy for the listener to grant him significant slack. Still in his mid-twenties, this recording captures him moving toward the crest of his powers (evidenced in his octets) and is one of the better trio dates in his discography. Recommended, as much for the marvelous "sidemen" as for Murray himself".

Peter Cranmer

Peter Cranmer (10 September 1914 – 29 May 1994) was an English sportsman who captained Warwickshire in first-class cricket and earlier in his career represented England at rugby union. After World War II he gave up on rugby and focused purely on cricket.
Cricket.
While primarily a specialist batsman, Cranmer was also a decent medium pace bowler. His highest score at first-class level was made for Warwickshire in his first year, an innings of 113 versus Northamptonshire at Edgbaston. Although he went to Christ Church, Oxford, he did not play cricket for the university side. 
Cranmer, a Major, served with the military during the war and spent time in both Burma and Egypt. He ended up at India in 1944 and appeared in a cricket match for the Europeans team. Cranmer also performed particularly well with the ball in a first-class match for the Bengal Governor's XI when he took 7 for 52 against Services XI at Eden Gardens. 
He had been appointed captain of Warwickshire in 1938 and remained in the role until 1947 before he retired, citing business commitments. One of his final innings as captain was in a match against the touring South Africans when he made 101 runs.
Rugby.
Cranmer was capped for England 16 times and took part in their Triple Crown winning Home Nations Championship campaigns of 1934 and 1937. A centre three-quarter, he also captained his country twice. In 1936 he was a member of the English team which defeated New Zealand for the first time and helped to set up Alexander Obolensky's famous tries.
Later life.
After leaving cricket, Cranmer became a journalist and worked with BBC Midlands. He commentated on two Test Matches for Test Match Special, one in 1965 and one in 1968. Illness caused him to retire from his job in 1976 and he began to use a wheelchair when he had both legs amputated. He died in 1994 at his home town of Peacehaven, Sussex.

Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs israélites de France

The Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs israélites de France (EEIF, "Jewish Guides and Scouts of France") is a Jewish Scouting and Guiding organization in France. It was founded in 1923 and serves about 4,000 members. The EEIF is a member of the Fédération du Scoutisme Français and of the International Forum of Jewish Scouts.
History.
The first Jewish Scout units in France were founded in 1923 in Versailles and in 1924 in Paris; the association "Eclaireurs israélites de France" (EIF) was founded in 1924. Jewish Guide units emerged also in the 1920s and were integrated in the "Fédération Française des Eclaireuses" (FFE; French Guides Federation) in 1928. 
In 1939, the EIF were admitted to the "Bureau inter-fédéral du scoutisme" which coordinated the membership of the different French Scouting associations within the World Organization of the Scout Movement; the Guides within the FEE were members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts through the "Comité de liaison" of the FFE and the Guides de France. In 1940, these two bodies reorganized and formed the Fédération du Scoutisme Français. 
Despite the German occupation of France during World War II and the banning of all Jewish youth organizations in the occupied zone in August 1940, the EIF maintained their activities. When the Vichy regime requested the dissolution of the EIF in November 1941, the groups could continue their work under the aegis of "Scoutisme Français" until January 1943. Many older members of EIF joined the French resistance forming own units; they joined the "Organisation juive de Combat" in 1944. About 110 leaders of the EIF were killed in action or deported to the concentration camps.
The EIF and the Guides within the FFE resumed their public activities after World War II. In 1948, a group of leaders emigrated to Israel founding a kibbutz and supporting the foundation of the country.
In 1969, the Jewish Guides left the FFE joining the EIF. Thus, the association was renamed to "Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs israélites de France".
Structure.
The association runs about 50 local groups in France, served by six regional councils, and one group in Montreal, Canada. Typically, a local group has at least one unit of each of the three younger branches.
Program.
The EEIdF works in four branches; all activities are coeducational:

The Graces (Ireland)

The Graces were a proposed series of reforms sought by Roman Catholics in Ireland in 1628-1634.
Background.
From 1570 to 1625 most people in the Kingdom of Ireland had remained Roman Catholic despite legislation that was increasingly excluding them from the political and official worlds. On the accession of King Charles I in 1625, whose queen was the French Catholic princess Henrietta Maria, the wealthier Catholics who sat in the Irish House of Lords and the Irish House of Commons moved to have anti-Catholic legislation reformed.
In 1628 the proposed reforms were listed and were collectively described as the "Graces", on the theory that Charles would exercise grace to allow loyal Catholics to take a full part in political life and to secure their titles to land. Charles agreed in principle to reform the laws as required, subject to legislation. At the same time he was trying to rule without the need for financial assistance from his parliaments in Ireland, England and Scotland. This was a difficulty as the Stuarts were not a wealthy dynasty and the crown had sold most of its estates to pay its bills in 1590-1625.
In Ireland the Tudor conquest culminated in the Nine Years War (1594–1603), which, with the Flight of the Earls in 1607, had led to reforms in 1613 that created a slight Protestant majority (108-102) of "New English" settlers and officials in the Irish House of Commons, enabled by the creation of some new Parliamentary boroughs in Ulster. The Irish House of Lords still had a Catholic majority, consisting mostly of Gaelic-origin and "Old English" landlords of Norman origin. Though the latter two groups had frequently been at war for centuries, they now shared a common interest in reforming their legal disabilities.
The word "Grace" itself also had a further theological significance for Catholics.
Failure.
The Irish parliament next sat in late 1634 and the order of business was led by Thomas Wentworth who had been Lord Deputy of Ireland since 1632. Wentworth's priority was to make Ireland profitable for Charles, and the first items on the agenda were supply bills that were passed without dissent. The Catholic members had all agreed to the new taxes on the understanding that their Graces - by now a list of 51 reforms - would be passed in the second session from 4 November to 14 December. The Catholic MPs in the Commons briefly had a majority caused by the absence of some Protestant MPs, and this increased their hopes that all the Graces would be enacted.
On 27 November Wentworth refused to allow two of the Graces. These were to extend the English statute of limitations to Ireland (then 70 years), and to guarantee the titles of the current landowners in Connacht, a province where the great majority of landlords were Catholic. Consequently the subsequent bills introduced by Wentworth were all opposed by the Catholic members. The Graces were shelved despite further representations to Charles. 
On 16 December Wentworth wrote as follows to Edward Coke in London:
Historians have disagreed to what extent Wentworth's letters on the 1634 session reflect reality, or were an unduly boastful and selective account to his colleagues in London. Given the few opportunities for parliamentary sessions at that time, debate also continues on whether or not the Catholic parliamentarians were unduly inflexible; they should perhaps have accepted 49 out of the 51 Graces in 1634, and then campaigned in London to try to secure the last two.
Outcomes.
The hopes dashed by the matter of the Graces were compounded by Wentworth's subsequent policies in Ireland. Particularly, he then challenged the freehold titles of many Old English families in Connacht that could be rectified only by the payment of large fines. The ensuing ill-feeling contributed in part to the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the establishment of Confederate Ireland that led on, ultimately, to the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649-53. For English political reasons, Wentworth was tried by parliament and executed in May 1641.

Dembel City Center is part of a modern development of the city center along Bole Road, also known as Airport Road or Africa Avenue. Bole Road like many of the streets in Addis Ababa is experiencing a large construction boom spurred by the growing Ethiopian Economy. However, recent construction to revamp this major avenue has created havoc for the many shopping centers, Dembel City Center being one of them.

GPRS roaming exchange

A GPRS roaming exchange (GRX) acts as a hub for GPRS connections from roaming users, removing the need for a dedicated link between each GPRS service provider. It was developed to facilitate a more efficient way for operators to interconnect networks, and played a large part in the transition to third-generation systems.
Development.
Initially GPRS roaming was based on complicated relationships between individual operators with each operator requiring a dedicated link to each different partner so that formula_1, whereby formula_2 is the number of global operators that would require a dedicated link. This meant that mobile subscribers who wanted to use GPRS whilst roaming could only do so if their operator had a direct agreement with the operator in the country or area in which they were roaming.
In 2000 the GSMA (GSM Association) developed the idea of GRX to handle all roaming between public land mobile networks (PLMNs).
Technical implementation.
Usually, GRX is based on a private or public IP backbone and uses GPRS Tunnelling Protocol on the session layer (OSI Layer Five) between the visited PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) and the home PLMN. Each GRX operator will have a network consisting of a set of routers and links connecting to the GPRS networks, moreover the GRX network will have links connecting to other GRX nodes in peer model.
The GRX operator can therefore act as a hub, allowing a GPRS subscriber to interconnect with many roaming partners without the need for dedicated links. For operators this is advantageous in that it allows quicker implementation of roaming partners, faster time to market for new operators and lower capital expenditure seeing as it is a scalable solution depending on bandwidth and quality of service requirements. Because the interconnection between the visited PLMN and home PLMN uses private GRX networks there is also no need to maintain Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) tunnels over the public internet.

Howard C. Belton

Howard C. Belton (January 2, 1893 – November 21, 1988) was an American farmer from the state of Oregon. A native of Algona, Iowa, he served as the nineteenth Treasurer of the State of Oregon after appointment by Oregon Governor Mark O. Hatfield. A Republican, he had previously served one term in the Oregon House of Representatives and five terms in the Oregon State Senate.
Early life.
Belton was born in Algona, Iowa on January 2, 1893. At seventeen he moved to Los Angeles, California. In 1915 he enrolled at the Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University) to study animal husbandry. He operated a farm in Canby, Oregon from 1917 to 1960. 
Belton was an active member of the Canby community. He served on the Canby Union School Board, was a president of both the Canby Kiwanis Club and Canby Chamber of Commerce, and also a founding board member of the Canby Union Bank.
Political career.
Belton was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1932, the same year that Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt beat President Herbert Hoover in Oregon by twenty-one points. 
In 1938 he won a seat in the Oregon State Senate. Belton sat on the Ways and Means Committee. He served as President of the Oregon State Senate for the 1945–1947 biennium. During the 1945 session Governor Earl Snell called for legislation to create a Tax Study Committee, with the original purpose of, 
“engaging the services of a nationally recognized firm of tax experts for the purpose of a complete survey, examination and analysis of all phases of our tax structure and report to the Legislature with recommendations as to the most attractive, advantageous and equitable tax system consistently possible for Oregon to devise.”
State Senator Belton was a member of the Tax Study Committee and their finished report was ready for review by the 1947 legislature. 
In 1948 Belton sought the Republican nomination for State Treasurer and won. He would lose the general election narrowly to Democrat Walter J. Pearson (49.6%–50.3%). He would continue to serve in the Oregon State Senate until his retirement in 1959. 
At the request of Governor Mark Hatfield, Belton came out of his short retirement and was appointed to fill the vacancy created after State Treasurer Sig Unander resigned from office. In the fall of 1960, he won his own term beating Democratic State Senator Ward H. Cook. He would only serve one term as Treasurer before retiring from politics again, serving from January 4, 1960 to January 4, 1965.
Belton was a delegate to the Republican conventions of 1944, 1952 and 1956.
Later years.
In his later years Belton was very productive in his community. He was member of the First Presbyterian Church in Salem and a member of the board of trustees of Lewis & Clark College for 15 years. 
Belton was also a member of the Salvation Army advisory board in Salem from 1963 to 1972 and served as chairman in 1968.
His wife Mae died in 1982. Belton died on November 21, 1988 at the age of 95 due to pneumonia. He is interred at Belcrest Memorial Park in Salem.

The Story of My Life (musical)

The Story of My Life is a musical with music and lyrics by Neil Bartram, and a book by Brian Hill. The show follows two childhood friends from age six to 35 and has only two characters.
The musical debuted in Toronto in 2006 and premiered on Broadway in February 2009, closing after five regular performances.
The Story.
The musical follows a lifelong friendship between two men, Alvin and Thomas, whose childhood bond continues throughout their adult years. Amazon.com describes the musical as "an authentic and affecting work, told through a series of songs in turn playful, touching and dramatic, and expertly orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick. One New York critic predicted, 'When the original cast recording comes out, see if you don't find yourself moved to Google the name of some long-lost friend with whom you simply lost touch. "The Story Of My Life" inspires us to reconnect with those who were part of the earliest chapters of our own life stories'."
Productions.
Following developmental readings at Manhattan Theatre Club, The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, and CanStage, "The Story of My Life" was produced in Toronto at the Canadian Stage Company in 2006. It was next produced at the National Alliance for Musical Theatre's Festival of New Musicals in the fall of 2007.
The musical then ran at Goodspeed Musicals, East Haddam, Connecticut from October 10, 2008 through November 2. The production was directed by Richard Maltby, Jr., and featured Will Chase as Thomas Weaver and Malcolm Gets as Alvin Kelby.
"The Story of My Life" premiered on Broadway at the Booth Theatre on February 3, 2009 and opened officially on February 19, 2009. Maltby directed with Chase and Gets reprising their roles. The musical closed on February 22, 2009 after five performances and 18 previews.
"The Story of My Life" received four 2009 Drama Desk Award nominations: Outstanding Music (Neil Bartram), Outstanding Lyrics (Neil Bartram), Outstanding Book (Brian Hill), and Outstanding Musical.
"The Story of My Life" received its first regional production in April 2010, at Act 2 Playhouse in Ambler, Pennsylvania. It was directed by Act 2's Producing Artistic Director Bud Martin (an original producer of the Broadway production) and starred Barrymore Award Winner Tony Braithwaite as Alvin Kelby and Jim Stanek as Thomas. 
"The Story of My LIfe" opened at the Dongsoong Art Center in central Seoul, Korea, on July 13 2010, produced by the OD Musical Company. That production returned on October 28th 2011.

Parker Jr., and accompaniment by Barbara Capogna Macko.
Response.
Ben Brantley, in his "New York Times" review, wrote that "In addition to jettisoning the usual excesses of tourist-trapping extravaganzas, they have tossed away such niceties as originality, credibility, tension and excitement...Mr. Chase and Mr. Gets sing and act with winning (and, under the circumstances, merciful) restraint." 
Michael Kuchwara, in his "Associated Press" review, wrote "The Story of My Life is a heartfelt little musical that has the courage of its sweet-tempered, low-key convictions. These days, that's a novelty. In a Broadway world of big musicals determined to sell themselves, this gentle new show celebrates softly but with an emotional pull that slowly wins you over."
NY1's Roma Torre said "Partners Neil Bartram, who wrote the music and lyrics, and Brian Hill, who wrote the obviously Sondheim-inspired book, fine-tuned this work with a keen insight for those seemingly inconsequential moments in relationships that turn out to be magically momentous. Bartram's lovely songs resonate on many levels, while Richard Maltby Jr. adds further dimension with his sharply-etched direction. Will Chase as Thomas and Malcolm Gets as Alvin are exceptionally talented. So perfectly matched in ways both subtle and large, they deliver splendidly calibrated performances that are simply flawless...This is an impressive collaborative effort that, despite its minimalism, has the power to pack quite an emotional punch."

Palmerston (car)

The Palmerston was a British car made by the Palmerston Motor Company based in Bournemouth, England between 1920 and 1923.
The company was founded by the three Bullock brothers who were trading as motor engineers in 1919
. In 1920 they founded the Palmerston Motor Company in Palmerston Road, Boscombe with the ambition of building their own range of light cars. The Palmerston car was advertised for sale in late 1920 and exhibited at the London Motor Show by agents Olympic Aeros and Autos also based in Boscombe.
The company was under capitalised and in 1921 was declared bankrupt and sold to new owners Francis Henry Morris and Bertie Francis Plant trading as the Palmerston Lytcar Company. A new larger engined model was designed and called the Palm and sold alongside the Palmerston. In November 1921 the company was sold again and became Palmcars Ltd with Morris and Plant remaining as directors. The company still failed to make money and receivers were appointed in 1922. It was sold to one of the major shareholders, Frederick Goddard but it seems unlikely that any more cars were made.
The total number of cars made is not known with estimates between 30 and 100.
Palmerston.
The Palmerston had a 6-9 hp Coventry-Victor water cooled, flat twin engine driving the rear wheels through a cone clutch, separately mounted three speed gearbox and bevel geared rear axle. The brakes acted on the rear wheels using a hand lever with the foot brake operating a transmission brake on the drive shaft behind the gearbox. The steel section chassis had quarter elliptic leaf springs front and rear. The early cars had wire spoked wheels later replaced by steel disc type.
The two seat body was built in-house from aluminium over a wood frame and supplied with a folding hood (top) and one piece windscreen. Although the first cars featured acetylene lights, a dynamo lighting set was provided by 1921.
The car was advertised at £275.
Palm.
The Palm had a larger 1018 cc engine, still by Coventry-Victor, with a taxation horsepower class of 9 hp. The gearbox was mounted in-unit with the engine and the gear lever centrally placed. The body now featured a dickey seat but it was also possible to buy a bare chassis for the purchaser to mount their own body on.
In early 1922 the car was advertised at £275 and the smaller car had its price cut to £250. By the end of the year the price had come down to £245 or £215 for a chassis.

Vakkom Moulavi

Vakkom Muhammed Abdul Khadir Moulavi, popularly known as "Vakkom Moulavi" was a social reformer, teacher, prolific writer, Muslim scholar, journalist, freedom fighter and newspaper proprietor in Travancore, a princely state of the present day Kerala, India. He was the founder and publisher of the newspaper "Swadeshabhimani" which was banned and confiscated by the Government of Travancore in 1910 due to its criticisms against the government and the Diwan of Travancore, P.Rajagopalachari.
Early life and family.
Moulavi was born in 1873 in Vakkom, Chirayinkil Taluk, Thiruvanthapuram in Travancore. His family had ancestral roots to Madurai and Hyderabad, and many of his relatives had worked for the military of the state government. Maulavi was proficient in many languages including Arabic, Hindusthani, Persian, Tamil, Sanskrit and English.
His father, a prominent merchant, engaged a number of scholars from distant places, including an itinerant Arab savant, to teach him every subject he wished to learn. Moulavi made such rapid progress, that some of his teachers soon found that their stock of knowledge was exhausted and at least one of them admitted that had learnt from his student more than he could teach him.
Moulavi's son Vakkom Abdul Kadar (Junior) was a writer,journalist and literary critic and another son, Mohammed Eeza was a writer and scholar of Islamic studies. One of his nephews, Vakkom Majeed, was an Indian freedom fighter and a former member of Travancore-Cochin State Assembly and another nephew, P.Habeeb Mohamed, was the first Muslim judge of the Travancore High Court of Kerala.
Journalism and Swadeshabhimani.
Maulavi started the "Swadeshabhimani" newspaper on January 19, 1905, declaring that `"the paper will not hesitate to expose injustices to the people in any form"`, but on 26 September 1910, the newspaper and press were sealed and confiscated by the British Police, and the editor Ramakrishna Pillai was arrested and banished from Travancore to Thirunelveli.
After the confiscation of the press, Moulavi concentrated more on social and cultural activities, becoming a social leader, also writing several books. "Daussabah" and "Islam Matha Sidantha Samgraham" are original works, while "Imam Ghazali’s Keemiya-e- Saadat", "Ahlu Sunnathuwal Jammath", "Islamic Sandesam", "Surat-ul fathiha" are translations.
Social Reformation.
Maulavi was considered one of greatest reformers in the Kerala Muslim community, and is sometimes referred to as the "father of muslim renaissance". He emphasized the religious and socioeconomic aspects much more than the ritualistic aspects of religion. He also campaigned for the need for modern education, the education of women, and the elimination of potentially bad customs among the Muslim community. Influenced by the writings of Muhammad Abduh of Egypt and his reform movement, Moulavi started journals in Arabi-Malayalam and in Malayalam modelled on Al Manar. The "Muslim" was launched in January 1906 and was followed by "Al-Islam"(1918) and "Deepika"(1931). Through these publications, he tried to teach the Muslim community about the basic tenets of Islam. "Al-Islam" began publishing in April 1918 and played a pivotal role in Muslim renaissance in Kerala. It opposed "Nercha"s and Uroos festivals amongst the Muslim community, thereby attracting opposition from the orthodox ulema to the extent that they issued a fatwa declaring the reading of it as sacrilege. Financial troubles and lack of readership led to the closure of the journal within five issues, but it is regarded as the pioneer journal that attempted religious reform amongst the Mappilas of Kerala. While it was published in Malayalam language using Arabi-Malayalam script, "Muslim" and "Deepika" used Malayalam in script also.
As a result of the continuous campaigning of Maulavi throughout the State, the Maharaja's Government introduced the teaching of Arabic in all state schools where there were Muslim pupils, and offered them fee concessions and scholarships. Girls were totally exempted from payment of fees. Maulavi wrote text books for children to learn Arabic, and a manual for training Arabic instructors for primary schools. At the instance of Maulavi Abdul Qadir the State Government soon instituted qualifying examinations for Arabic teachers of which he was made the chief examiner.
There were many other dubious practices in the Muslim community of the time, such as the dowry system, extravagant expenditure on weddings, celebration of annual "urs" and Moharrum with bizarre unIslamic features bordering on idolatrous rituals. Maulavi launched his campaign against such practices with the help of his disciples, and with the cooperation of other learned men who shared his views and ideals. As the campaign developed into a powerful movement, opposition was mounted by the Mullahs. Some issued "fatwas" that he was a "kafir", others branded him as a "Wahhabi".
He also tried to create unity among Muslims, starting the "All Travancore Muslim Mahajanasabha" and "Chirayinkil Taluk Muslim Samagam", and worked as the chairman of the Muslim Board of the Government of Travancore. His activities were further instrumental in the establishment of "Muslim Aikya Sangham", a united Muslim forum for all the Muslims of the Travancore, Cochin and Malabar regions, and helped guide the Lajnathul Mohammadiyya Association of Alappuzha, Dharma Bhoshini Sabha of Kollam amongst others.
In 1931, he founded the "Islamia Publishing House", with his eldest son Abdussalam supervising the translation into Malayam and publication of Allama Shibli's biography of Omar Farooq in two volumes under the title "Al Farooq".
Last days.
In "Deepika", he serialized the Malayalam translation of the Quran, together with his brief commentary and the original text written in an elegant calligraphic style by Maulavi himself. It was his life's ambition to produce a translation of the Quran in Malayalam with his own commentary, but he died on 23 August 1932 aged 82 before the work was completed.
Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust (VMFT).
The Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust (VMFT) is intended to be a lasting memorial to Vakkom Moulavi. Dr N. A. Karim, former Pro-Vice Chancellor of Kerala University is the President of the Trust and Er.A.Suhair is the Chairman and Managing Trustee.

Bruno Dutot

Bruno Dutot (born 19 October 1962) is a French-born Australian painter, known especially for his public mural of 'Oucha' a woman with cat in Edgecliff, Sydney.
Born in Normandy, the youngest child of 8 siblings, Dutot trained at the fine arts school "École des Beaux-Arts" in Caen for 2 years.
Dutot emigrated to Australia in 1987 and promptly began infusing Sydney with French style by painting walls in various locations.
His artistic style has evolved from the red dress he used to draw in Paris to 'Rochelle', the elegant stylised woman facing away from the viewer, with elongated, free-flowing arms, accompanied by a cat.
Rochelle is most famously displayed on the wall at the intersection of New South Head Rd and Darling Point Rd, Edgecliff. This iconic painting, best seen travelling East on New South Head Rd, dates back to the mid-1980s and has developed into a community project. 
In the mid-1990s, Dutot left Sydney for five years during which, unbeknown to him, other artists maintained the spirit of the artwork. Since his return, Bruno has regularly updated the wall with new themes and messages.
Dutot's public painting now holds cultural significance to many Sydneysiders. In an interview with Music Australia singer/songwriter Wendy Matthews summed it up: "Every time I come to the city I drive past her, see if she's changed. Sometimes she'll have a cat or be standing in snow. Though you never see her face, she's come to symbolise Sydney for me."
Paintings of Rochelle can now be found in art galleries around Sydney, usually with a variation of the title ‘Oucha’.

Zwiesel–Bodenmais railway

The Zwiesel–Bodenmais railway was the last railway line to be built in Lower Bavaria, a province of the state of Bavaria in southeast Germany. Today it is route number 907 in the timetable. Construction started in 1921 as part of a move to support this depressed area and it was taken into service on 3 September 1928. The 14.3 km long stub line connects to the Bavarian Forest railway from Plattling to Eisenstein opened on 16 September 1877 and also to the line to Grafenau, Bavaria (KBS 906), opened on 1 September 1890.
History.
On 9 August 1928 the first test run on the line took place. At the official opening on 3 September 1928 people massed at the stations and halts and the newly opened railway carried about 2,500 passengers to Bodenmais that day. All the reports expressed hopes that the line would soon be extended through the Zeller Valley ("Zellertal").
The planned extension from Bodenmais through the Zeller Valley to Kötzting did not come to fruition however, because in 1927 the privately run "Regentalbahn" had opened a railway from Gotteszell to Blaibach just a few kilometres away and, as a result, a connexion between the Forest Railway and the railway network via Cham already existed. There were also important opponents of the extension, und so the construction of the line from Bodenmais to Kötzting was cancelled in the early 1930s on the grounds that the local communities were unable to agree on it.
Soon after the opening of the route its low profitability became clear. As early as the 1960s there were rumours of its approaching closure. In the 1970s and 80s this topic was repeatedly taken up in the media. In January 1984 there was a major television debate over the continued existence of the line. On 27 September 1984 the Nuremberg railway division admitted that it had been trying for 15 years to reach a decision over the future over the very poorly utilised Zwiesel–Bodenmais route. Despite all fears, the line remained open.
Present-day.
The line from Zwiesel to Bodenmais has three request stops: at Aussenried, Langdorf and Böhmhof. Only Zwiesel station is still staffed. In 1987 the station property in Bodenmais was bought by Bodenmais market in order to erect a new building there, that serves as a town hall and tourist information centre.
In the second half of the 20th century the line was worked by Uerdingen railbuses. From 1993 the "Regentalbahn" ran this route under contract from the DB with their old Esslingen railbuses, since 1996 these run every hour. The operation has been continued since 1997 by the "Regentalbahn" with Regio-Shuttles, the journey time being just 19 minutes. The fare deals have been popular with locals and tourists alike.

His great-grandfather, Rabbi Shaul (Saul) Hacohen was the head of the rabbinical court in Djerba. Moshe (Chalfon) was named after his grandfather, Rabbi Moshe Hacohen, author of the book "Pnai Moshe"; "Halphon" is a nickname. His father Rabbi Shalom, the author of numerous books including "Nahar Shalom", "Hefetz Yakar" and "HaimVeShalom", was initially the rabbi and head of the local rabbinical court in the city of Zervis, near Djerba, but in 1924 he emigrated to Mandatory Palestine to join the Elders of Zefat (Safed).
Early years.
During his youth Moshe's family were well off financially and they were well known for their generosity and the support they gave to the elderly and poor of Djerba. However, when he became a teenager his family's financial situation took a turn for the worse and Moshe contributed to the family income by working a book editor and copyist. 
He received his Jewish education from his father as well as the chief rabbi of Tunisia, Rabbi Yoseph (Joseph) Barbi. When his father was called upon to be the rabbi of Zervis, Moshe was asked by the local community to become their ritual slaughterer. At the age of 17 he mastered the laws of Jewish ritual slaughter and began to work in the profession. However, the difficult conditions, primarily the outdoor heat during the summer, caused him to become feverish as well as affecting his vision. He wished to continue working in order to help his family financially, but they prevailed upon him to return to Djerba and to continue with his studies.
Family.
In 1895, at the age of 21, Moshe married Masida, daughter of his maternal uncle Rabbi Aharon Hacohen. The couple has two sons and four daughters:
Leadership.
In 1917, at the age of 43, Rabbi Moshe was appointed as a member of the rabbinical court of Djerba (serving together with Rabbi Zvi Hacohen Yehonatan and Rabbi Mordechai Emaus Cohen). It took a great deal of pressure to persuade him to accept the appointment; he completely refused the position of head of the court and only accepted the appointment as the third member. This court enacted a number of important decrees and carefully regulated the lives of the Jewish communities throughout the island. 
In 1943 the Nazis came to Tunisia, and demanded that Rabbi Moshe collect 50 kilos of gold in 3 hours and hand it over to them; otherwise they would bomb the Jewish communities of Djerba and Tunis. The next day the Allies conquered Tunisia and the Nazis were gone from Tunisia. The 35 kilos of gold that the Jews managed to collect was not handed to the Germans.
Relationship to Zionism, the State of Israel and Modernity.
Rabbi Moshe was an enthusiastic supporter of the Zionist movement. Among other decrees, he decreed that Israel's Independence Day be celebrated for three days. His writings that predate the State of Israel are full of detailed political plans, not only regarding Zionist ideas but also expanding upon his cosmopolitan ideas, such as a plan to establish a League of Nations and a World Court, both of which would have their headquarters in Jerusalem. 
While he was still living in Djerba he purchased land in Israel. In his old age, after his health deteriorated, he decided to emigrate to Israel. His son Shushan traveled to Tunis to arrange the necessary visas but Rabbi Moshe's health deteriorated even further and the emigration had to be called off.
Death and Burial.
Rabbi Moshe died on the 18th of Shevat 1950 in Djerba. During his funeral, the cities in the area emptied of their Jewish residents, all of whom attended the funeral. The main souk of Djerba was closed for the day, since most the stores were owned by Jews. Tens of thousands of mourners, including representatives of the governments of Tunisia and France, attended the funeral. He was buried in Djerba but in 2006, 55 years after his death, his bones were moved from Tunisia to Israel (via France) to the Mount of Respite cemetery in Jerusalem. This transfer required the concerted efforts of many people, including the Foreign Minister of Tunisia. The second funeral, which lasted three days, was attended by thousands of Jews from Tunisia, France and Israel. Among the eulogizers was former Israeli chief rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, who characterized Rabbi Moshe's philosophy of Jewish law as closely adhering to the judgements of the author of the Shulchan Arukh (Rabbi Joseph Caro).
Works.
Approximately 80 of his works have been published, covering all facets of Judaism. Nonetheless, many works remain in manuscript. He is best known for two of his works in Jewish law (halacha): "Responsa Shoel VeNishal", a collection of more than 3,000 responsa he penned, in 8 volumes, and "Brit Kehuna", a compilation of the customs of the Jewish community of Djerba and its surroundings, following the order of the Shulchan Arukh. Among his works that remain in manuscript is: "Zedek VeRahamim".

Standard fare

In Ireland, a standard fare is issued to a passenger on Dublin Bus and Luas services who fails to present a valid ticket on request. It is similar to penalty fares as issued in the UK.
A standard fare on Dublin Bus is €50. On Luas, it is €45. While these fares are far in excess of the maximum cash fares (€6 on Dublin Bus, €4 on Luas), legally they are not fines. However, any person who fails to pay a standard fare within a defined time (usually 21 days) after incurring it is liable to prosecution.

Ansche Chesed

Ansche Chesed is a synagogue on the Upper West Side of the New York City borough of Manhattan.
History.
The congregation was founded in 1828 by a group of German, Dutch and Polish Jews who split off from Congregation B'nai Jeshurun. By the time the congregation erected the building on Norfolk Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side that is now the Angel Orensanz Center in 1850, there had been further secessions and the congregation was composed of immigrants from Germany. It was also the largest in the United States. In the 1870s, the congregation merged with Temple Emanu-El, but by 1881 the more traditional German Jews of Ansche Chesed had reformed, been joined by newer immigrants, and were meeting in Yorkville at Lexington Avenue and 113th Street.
In 1908, the congregation was part of the movement of upper-middle-class New Yorkers to the newly fashionable neighborhood of Harlem. The congregation opened a handsome, brick, Greek revival Temple at Seventh Avenue and 114th Street.
In 1928, the congregation again followed fashion, from Harlem to the even newer Upper West Side of Manhattan, opening its present Byzantine revival building at West End Avenue and 100th Street. The architect was Edward I. Shire.
Contemporary.
Ansche Chesed is an egalitarian, participatory Conservative synagogue. In addition to its historic sanctuary, the congregation has a multi-story building with many classrooms and several event spaces. This makes it possible for multiple activities to take place in the building throughout the week, as well as for several minyanim to meet within the congregation. The minyanim include:
Ansche Chesed's Sanctuary Service is the minyan that directly continues the historical congregation of Ansche Chesed; its name derives from the fact that it holds its services in the synagogue's sanctuary. This service follows the traditional Conservative liturgy (including full Torah reading and Haftarah and Musaf service). Rabbi Jeremy Kalmanofsky delivers Divrei Torah (comments and explanations on the weekly Torah portion) several times a month and offers weekly comments on various aspects of the service. Cantor Natasha J. Hirschhorn leads the sung portion of the service, and is also Ansche Chesed's music director. Lay members of the congregation also participate actively in all facets of the service.
Ansche Chesed runs a Hebrew School, with classes that begin in pre-school and continue through the teen years. The Hebrew School focuses on teaching children to:
The synagogue also runs an array of other educational initiatives, focused on adult learning, literature, and family programs. A Social Action Committee oversees a series of community outreach and support programs, including the hosting of a homeless shelter, local park clean-up activities, and programs focused on topics such as the environment.
Ansche Chesed hosts several unaffiliated nursery schools, including Purple Circle, Yaldaynu Preschool, and Discovery Programs.

Bacillus subtilis BSR sRNAs

In a screen of the "Bacillus subtilis" genome for genes encoding ncRNAs, Saito et al. focused on 123 intergenic regions (IGRs) over 500 base pairs in length, the authors analyzed expression from these regions. Seven IGRs termed bsrC, bsrD, bsrE, bsrF, bsrG, bsrH and bsrI expressed RNAs smaller than 380 nt. All the small RNAs except BsrD RNA were expressed in transformed "Escherichia coli" cells harboring a plasmid with PCR-amplified IGRs of "B. subtilis", indicating that their own promoters independently express small RNAs. Under non-stressed condition, depletion of the genes for the small RNAs did not affect growth. Although their functions are unknown, gene expression profiles at several time points showed that most of the genes except for bsrD were expressed during the vegetative phase (4–6 h), but undetectable during the stationary phase (8 h). Mapping the 5' ends of the 6 small RNAs revealed that the genes for BsrE, BsrF, BsrG, BsrH, and BsrI RNAs are preceded by a recognition site for RNA polymerase sigma factor σA.

Gurgel Carajás

Gurgel Carajás was a Brazilian car, a SUV, produced by Gurgel between late 1984 and January, 1991. All Carajás were 4 x 2 drive, but they were produced with three engine options: gasoline and ethanol with 1800cc, and diesel with 1600cc. It had a front engine and a rear transmission, connecting both by the use of a system called Tork Tube System, or TTS for short. The late Carajás VIP has four doors on a slightly longer wheelbase, although the long front doors are the same as those fitted on two-door versions which does not help its appearance.
Between 1985 and 1990, it was the number one selling vehicle in its class in Brazil. In 1989, Gurgel Carajás had 75% of market share, against just 25% of its only option in Brazil: the very expensive Toyota Bandeirante. Between 1976 and 1990, importing vehicles was illegal.
This success however was over on the second semester of 1990, when the Lada Niva came to Brazil, and Gurgel Carajás' sales fell. For Gurgel, until 1990, this vehicle was very profitable; on January, 1991, the production was halted.

"Welcome to Mali" has received mostly positive reviews. On the review aggregate site Metacritic, the album has a score of 86 out of 100, indicating "Universal acclaim." 
Keith Phillips of The A.V. Club gave the album a grade of A-, writing ""Welcome To Mali" sounds heavily produced but not overproduced, and even with the pings and whizzing, Amadou’s playing and the pair’s singing insure it never sounds less than organic." In another positive review, Pitchfork Media's Joe Tangari wrote: "This album is an affirmation of global connectivity and an emerging global culture that transcends and repurposes tradition as it sees fit-- the sound of Mali merging with the world at large."

Name.
The settlement was attested in written sources in 1286 as "Erenbrehen" (and as "Erinrich" in 1291, "Ernnechen" and "Ermbrechen" before 1392, "Ernwrehen" in 1395, "Emerhern" in 1421, and "Ermerhern" in 1428). The Slovene name is a fused prepositional phrase, from *"v Ermaše". The initial "*Ver-" changed to "Vir-" as a regular sound change in the local dialect. The root of the Slovene name is the accusative plural demonym "*Erm(r)ašane", derived from the toponym "*Ermrah". This was borrowed into Slovene from Middle High German "*Eren-rîch", a compound originally meaning 'rich in honor'.

April Rain

April Rain is the second full-length album by the Dutch symphonic metal band, Delain. It was released in the Benelux on March 20, 2009 and was released internationally on March 30, 2009 by Roadrunner Records. It was released in Australia on April 10, 2009.
History.
Martijn Westerholt, founder of Delain, originally did not intend Delain to be a live band. But after the success of debut album "Lucidity" a live band was created. With this band, the album "April Rain" was recorded. 
Demo versions of "Stay Forever" and "Start Swimming" were already played live by Delain in 2007 and 2008. In November 2008, a version of the song "I'll Reach You" with alternate lyrics was performed live on a Dutch TV show to get attention for UNICEF & BT's "Inspiring Young Minds" charity.
The original release date for the album was February 9, 2009, but in January it was announced that the release was postponed to coincide with foreign release dates.
In February 2009, "April Rain" was revealed to be the first single from this album when it became available for purchase online.
On March 13, 2009, the Dutch website of Roadrunner Records put the entire album up for streaming, only available to residents of the Netherlands.
In October 2009, "Stay Forever" was announced as the second single from the album.
Personnel.
Guests.
While Delain's previous album "Lucidity" contained a lot of guest appearances, this album contains only a few: by Finnish singer Marco Hietala, who was featured on multiple "Lucidity" tracks as well and by Maria Ahn, cellist from the Ahn Trio. Only one song on "April Rain" contains death growls, "Virtue and Vice". This time the growls are recorded by guitarist Ronald Landa, who also contributes clean vocals on "Invidia".

Asemia

Asemia is the term for the medical condition of being unable to understand or express any signs or symbols.
It is a more severe condition than aphasia, which is the inability to understand linguistic signs. Asemia is caused by damage to the areas of the brain that process communication. More specifically when there is damage to the left side of the brain in the areas that process communication such as Broca and Wernike’s areas. Damage can be inflicted by physical trauma to the brain, but is more commonly caused by stroke and sometimes tumors. The onset of this condition is usually quick but not permanent. Treatment of this condition is traditional speech therapy in which the individual must relearn how to read, write, and talk. Depending on the severity of the injury recovery can take days to years. Considerable recovery is common, but often not to the full extent of baseline ability.

Newton-Bennett

The Newton Bennett was a car advertised and sold by a Manchester, England, based company between 1911 and 1925 but made in Italy.
John Bennett was a Manchester car dealer selling locally made Belsize cars and holding agencies for several French makes. This merged with a similar company, Bennett and Carlisle to become Newton-Bennett. As well as selling cars they manufactured vehicle parts and R.O. Harper was employed as works manager.
In 1907 they became agents for the Italian SCAT and Harper was sent to Turin to help develop a car specifically to be sold by Newton-Bennett but this never got beyond a prototype. Instead, they purchased a complete factory, also in Turin, that had made the VALT car. With Harper installed at the new factory, he designed a car which would be badged as a Newton-Bennett.
In 1914 the name changed to Newton but the outbreak of World War I and a large increase in import duties seem to have stopped production. In 1915 the factory was sold to Diatto.
A Newton car was advertised again post war as the Ten, this time with a smaller 1086 cc engine with twin overhead camshafts.
Between 500 and 1000 cars are thought to have been made. At least five cars are thought to survive.
Newton-Bennett.
The car had a 2155 cc four-cylinder, water-cooled, side-valve, engine This was directly attached to a four-speed gearbox and then by shaft to the rear axle. A compressed air starter was fitted. The steel section chassis had half elliptic leaf springs all round. The brakes followed the convention of the time, with the hand lever operating the rear drums and the foot pedal a transmission brake. Even though the cars were right hand drive, the gear change lever was on the driver's right side, as was the custom at the time. The car was distinguished by a sharply V-shaped radiator.
The cars were moved to England in chassis form and either supplied as such to buyers or had bodies built by Newton-Bennett. Most were four-seat open tourers but some two-seaters and closed saloons were also made. Some were exported directly from Italy.
Newton Ten.
The car was available in two sizes, a short-wheelbase sports and standard model. The distinctive pre-war radiator design does not seem to have been carried through. The maker of the engine is not known, but it used Bosch electrics and a Claudel-Hobson carburettor. The conventional chassis with half elliptic leaf springs had four-wheel brakes.
It was advertised in chassis form at £395.

2010 Tour de France

The 2010 Tour de France was the 97th edition of the Tour de France cycle race, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started on with an 8.9 km prologue time trial in Rotterdam, the first start in the Netherlands since 1996. The race visited three countries: the Netherlands, Belgium and France, and finished on on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.
The total length was including in time-trials. Following an opening prologue time trial, the first three stages passed through the Netherlands and Belgium on routes designed to replicate some features of the spring classic cycle races. This included seven cobblestone sectors totaling , the longest distance of cobblestones in the Tour since 1983, on stage 3. There were six mountain stages, three of them with mountaintop finishes, and two medium mountain stages. In the 100th anniversary year of their first inclusion on the Tour, the emphasis was on the Pyrenees, with two ascents of the Col du Tourmalet.
The Tour was initially won by Alberto Contador, who was later revealed to have failed a doping test. After a series of events, the CAS finally decided in February 2012 that Contador lost his results from 2010, declaring Andy Schleck the new winner. Schleck also won the young riders' competition for the third time running. France's Anthony Charteau won the polkadot jersey as the King of the Mountains whilst the Italian sprinter Alessandro Petacchi won the green jersey for victory in the points classification.
The official Tour presentation was held on 2009. It was the third consecutive Grand Tour to begin in the Netherlands, as the 2009 Vuelta a España began in Assen, and the 2010 Giro d'Italia in Amsterdam.
Teams.
Twenty-two teams accepted invitations to participate in the 2010 Tour de France. Sixteen of the teams were covered by a September 2008 agreement with the Union Cycliste Internationale, including two no longer part of the UCI ProTour. The sixteen teams were:
Six other teams, including the four ProTour teams not guaranteed a place, accepted their invitations:
† indicates teams that were not part of the UCI ProTour.
Pre-race favorites.
Before the start of the race, Contador was the overall race favorite. Among the other favorites were Andy Schleck, Cadel Evans, and Lance Armstrong. The US media, led by the US Tour broadcaster Versus, pitched the race as a showdown between Contador and Armstrong, both multi-tour champions going in. It has been since pointed out, however, that Armstrong's chances were perhaps exaggerated prior to the race; the two had already met that year in a two-day race in March at the Criterium International and Contador had finished four minutes ahead of Armstrong.
Race overview.
The race started in Rotterdam with an 9 km prologue won by Fabian Cancellara. Sylvain Chavanel claimed the lead from Cancellara on Stage 2, after a massive crash which involved many riders, most notably Andy Schleck, a contender for overall victory, and Alessandro Petacchi. The riders in the peloton chose to wait for the fallen riders. However, on the cobbles of Stage 3, Cancellara retook the overall lead as Chavanel struggled. Fränk Schleck had to retire from the race, having sustained a collarbone fracture on a crash which delayed many of the riders in the peloton, including Contador and Armstrong who were hopeful of finishing high in the general classification. A number of their rivals, including Cancellara, Andy Schleck, Cadel Evans and Thor Hushovd, were ahead of the crash and so were able to gain a time advantage. On the same stage, Tony Martin, who had been wearing the white jersey since the prologue, lost it to Geraint Thomas, and Hushovd, after winning the stage, took the lead in the points
On Stage 7 Chavanel again raced away from the field to take his second stage win and maillot jaune of the 2010 edition of the race, whilst Andy Schleck took the young riders' classification lead from Thomas. Evans took the yellow jersey from Chavanel the following day on Stage 8, and in turn lost the lead to Schleck on Stage 9 following a rest day.
In Stage 11, Petacchi took the green jersey from Hushovd; Mark Cavendish won the stage, but his leadout rider, Mark Renshaw, was disqualified from the Tour after headbutting Julian Dean while leading out his teammate.
On Stage 15 Schleck was race leader and pressing the pace over the day's final climb of Port de Bales when he threw his chain. Contador and Denis Menchov immediately moved to the front and attacked, pressing the advantage over the crest of the climb and all the way back down into Bagneres-de-Luchon. They were aided by Sammy Sanchez and two others making a group of five riders, all looking to gain time. Schleck chased hard, but had no other riders to help bridge the gap. By stage's end, he had lost the yellow jersey and 39 seconds to Contador. Contador, who now had an eight second lead in the race, met with a mixed reception as he received the yellow jersey on the podium at the end of the stage.
Contador said that he did not know that Schleck had technical trouble, and that he had already launched an attack by then, but review of the race shows that he was chasing an attack by Schleck, that he nearly struck Schleck as he moved past him, and that he looked back repeatedly on the climb while Schleck struggled to close down the gap. Hours later, he apologised for the incident. Although he was criticised by Sean Kelly and a number of riders both past and current, he also found support from the likes of Bernard Hinault, Miguel Indurain, Eddy Merckx and Laurent Jalabert. Cervélo team owner Gerard Vroomen commented: "Contador just gained a great chance to win, but he lost the chance to win greatly." This same stage saw Anthony Charteau take the lead in the King of the Mountains competition from fellow Frenchman Jérôme Pineau.
The 17th stage was considered this Tour's queen stage. The first-category Col de Marie-Blanque and Col du Soulor climbs preceded a grueling summit finish atop of the Hors Catégorie Col de Tourmalet, the second ascent of the Tourmalet of this year's Tour. The stage turned into a battle between Andy Schleck and Alberto Contador. The tour's top two riders separated themselves from the field on the final climb. Schleck launched numerous attacks upon Contador in the final 15 kilometres, but was unable to separate from him. Contador coolly stayed on Schleck's wheel, and attacked as well once, but was pulled back by Schleck. Schleck went on to take the stage over Contador, who seemed happy to follow Schleck across the line while holding a seemingly unassailable lead in the GC. Meanwhile Anthony Charteau confirmed his hold on the Polka-dot Jersey, as the Tour completed its final categorized climbs.
Stage 19 was the final time trial. It was widely expected that Contador would increase his lead over Schleck, who in the past had struggled in this discipline, but the initial going surprised all as Schleck set a high pace that Contador had difficulty matching. By the first time check Schleck had picked up six seconds, cutting Contador's overall lead to just two seconds on the road. By the second time check Contador had recovered his losses and extended his lead over Schleck by six seconds. Over the final third of the course Contador extended his advantage, gaining an additional twenty-five seconds on his rival for an overall gain of thirty-one seconds for the stage. Fabian Cancellara, the Olympic and World Time Trial Champion, won the stage by seventeen seconds over runner-up Tony Martin. In addition Denis Menchov was able to overtake Samuel Sánchez for third place overall, while Ryder Hesjedal was able to move in front of Joaquim Rodríguez for the seventh place slot in the GC. Contador's first-place lead increased to 39 seconds, essentially guaranteeing him the victory.
The final stage was won by Cavendish, who became the first winner of consecutive Champs-Élysées stages. The Manx sprinter won five stages in the 2010 Tour, more than any other rider, taking his career tally to 15 stage wins.
Original tour winner Alberto Contador finished surrounded by his Astana teammates. This was his third Tour de France in three consecutive entries, after having won it in 2007 and 2009. Schleck finished in second place for the second year in a row (later to receive the victory after Contador's positive test and subsequent ban) and Menchov completed the podium in third place. Petacchi won the Green jersey. His second-place finish in the final stage gave him enough points to finish just above Cavendish and Hushovd. France's Charteau won the Polka dot jersey.
Stages.
The 97th edition of the Tour consisted of nine flat stages, six mountain stages (three summit finishes), four medium mountain stages, and two individual time trials, one of them being the opening prologue in Rotterdam.
Aftermath.
Alberto Contador.
In September 2010, Contador revealed that a urine sample he had given on 21 July, a rest day in the 2010 Tour de France, had contained traces of clenbuterol. He has stated, due to the number of other tests he passed and that only a tiny amount of the substance was detected in the one he failed, that food contamination was to blame.
The UCI issued a statement reporting that the concentration was 50 picograms per millilitre, and that this was 1/40 the minimum standards of detection capability required by WADA, and that further scientific investigation would be required.
In late January 2011, the Spanish Cycling Federation proposed a one year ban, but it subsequently accepted Contador's appeal and cleared him of all charges. The UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency each referred the decision independently to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in March 2011, but Contador remained free to ride until their ruling was made. The hearing was delayed until after the 2011 Tour de France at Contador's request and then deferred to November 2011. In February 2012, the CAS stripped Contador of the 2010 title making Andy Schleck the winner.
List of suspicion for doping.
In May 2011, newspaper "l'Equipe" published a list of cyclists and an index that indicated the suspicion for doping use.

Sanctuary for All

"Sanctuary for All" is the two-part series premiere of the science fiction television series "Sanctuary", a television spinoff from the web series of the same name. Both parts originally aired on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States for October 3, 2008, and subsequently aired on ITV4 in the United Kingdom on October 6 and October 13, 2008. They were written by Damian Kindler, and directed by Martin Wood; both were known for their works on the "Stargate" franchise.
"Sanctuary for All" is set in the fictional city of Old City, where forensic psychiatrist Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) investigates the bizarre murder of two police officers, and eventually comes across Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) and her team, who are hunting the creature responsible, known as an "abnormal". The title refers to the motto on Magnus's business card. It also achieved high ratings for both the Sci Fi Channel and ITV4, and received generally positive reviews. For its visual effects, the series premiere won a Gemini Award, and a further Leo and Emmy nominations.
Plot.
Part 1.
As the episode opens, two police officers answer a call to a disturbance in the home of Eastern European immigrants. They discover the body of a man, apparently shot in the head, then they notice a young boy cowering under the bed in the same room. As he attempts to coax the boy out, the first officer is killed by a mysterious snake-like creature, which stabs him in the forehead, leaving a wound resembling a gunshot. When the boy emerges from behind the bed, the snake creature rears and (although not shown) it kills the second officer. 
After the deaths, forensic expert Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) is called in to inspect the murder scene. The police assume the victims have been shot, and claim to have apprehended the shooter (played by David Hewlett in the first webisode, but was played by another actor in this episode), who was fleeing the scene. Will sees no evidence of a gun being used and quickly deduces that all is not as it seems at the apartment, but his theories are ridiculed by Detective Joe Kavanagh (Kavan Smith). As he leaves, Will spots the boy and chases him down a back alley, where he narrowly avoids being struck by a young woman on a motorcycle who is also evidently pursuing the boy. He begins to chase them both, but moments later he is struck from behind by a car. Before lapsing into unconsciousness, he catches a glimpse of the driver—Helen Magnus.
Will regains consciousness and finds himself at Magnus' home. She begins to explain the truth behind the murders, and reveals that she knows about Will's long-repressed and traumatic childhood memory of his mother being killed by some kind of monster. She offers Will a position with her organization - The Sanctuary, which is housed in a top secret base under a partially ruined cathedral in an unnamed city. It houses a variety of "abnormals," who are, she believes, some of nature's triumphs and mistakes. Magnus explains that these creatures would have been mistreated, exploited or killed in the outside world, and that she and her team have dedicated their lives to rescuing and caring for these abnormals. She shows Will the fantastic creatures who inhabit the Sanctuary, including a mermaid; he also meets a Bigfoot (played by Christopher Heyerdahl), who has become one of Magnus' staff after being rescued and healed by her. 
She tells Will that she has been tracking the "snake-boy", cryptically hinting that he is, and yet is not, responsible for the murders. Though very reluctant and confused, Will agrees to give the new job a try. In the next sequence, we discover that the girl on the motorcycle is Magnus' daughter, Ashley (Emilie Ullerup); she locates and chases the "mutant" boy down into the subway tunnels and after she finally corners him, Helen arrives and assists with his capture. On their return to the Sanctuary, they discover that the boy, Alexi (Cainan Wiebe) has a symbiotic appendage growing from his abdomen, which seems to have a will of its own. This symbiote is evidently responsible for the murders, although the team are as yet unable to work out why, so Magnus assigns Will his first task - questioning the boy and finding out why his symbiote has killed.
Part 2.
Will questions Alexi, and realises that the symbiote detects fear in its host and only kills if the boy feels frightened, remaining dormant if he feels safe. They also learn that his mutation has been caused by the Chernobyl disaster. Meanwhile, John Druitt (also played by Christopher Heyerdahl), who appears to have the power to teleport anywhere at will, arrives in search of the Sanctuary, although he is at first prevented from entering by some kind of force barrier. John then locates Ashley and confronts her; after a struggle, she and one of her colleagues are eventually able to subdue him using tranquillizers and a powerful Taser charge, although as he collapses he recites some kind of poem or incantation which mentions "The Five" (this is the first reference in the series to a key plot element which will have great significance in later episodes). Helen has meanwhile learned of a prostitute who has been murdered, and seems somewhat disturbed by this development.
Soon after Ashley has brought Druitt inside the Sanctuary, he reveals that he has allowed himself to be captured. He immediately escapes and forces Magnus' technical expert Henry Foss (Ryan Robbins) to shut down the EM shield. Now free to teleport at will, he appears in Magnus' study, seizes Ashley, teleports away with her, and imprisons her in the enclosure of one of the deadliest abnormals, as a means of forcing Magnus to do his bidding. However, unknown to Druitt, Ashley is quickly rescued by Will and "Bigfoot". Druitt then returns to Helen, reveals that he is dying again, and forces her to give him some of her blood to save him. However Magnus has prepared for such an eventuality and gives him a poisoned blood vial instead, hoping to end his reign of terror. Although evidently affected, Druitt manages to teleport away. 
Soon after, Will's repressed childhood memories are triggered by the sight of the abnormal from which Ashley has just been rescued. He finally realises that that it was Magnus who had saved him as a boy from the monster that killed his mother. Realising that she looks exactly the same, he at first assumes that she can travel through time, but Magnus then admits that she in fact 157 years old, and that her longevity is the result of being injected with Vampire blood during her studies in Oxford University in the 1800s. 
Helen then reveals that Druitt had been her fiancé in the 1880s. After suffering a life-threatening injury, she saved his life, but the procedure had given him the power to teleport. This had driven him insane, and he went on a killing spree, murdering at least eight prostitutes in Victorian London - John Druitt is in fact the serial killer who has become known to history as Jack the Ripper. In a flashback, we see Helen confronting John in an attempt to stop him committing the last of Ripper murders, but he kills the girl anyway and teleports away, although Magnus apparently wounds him as he vanishes. She then reveals that, after John's disappearance, she froze one of the embryos she had conceived with him, but when she could no longer bear the loneliness of losing him, she used it to give birth to their daughter Ashley, who knows nothing of her father's true identity. It is because of Druitt's power that Magnus has placed an EM shield around the Sanctuary, to prevent him from being able to teleport into it. Zimmerman decides to join the Sanctuary.
Production.
The producers wished to feature the series in a fictional city, Old City, located in the West Coast of North America. The working name for the city was "Odisburg". The idea behind Alexi's "creepy" expressions in the beginning of the episode were Wiebe's idea, and the producers granted his request.
Both parts of the episode were effectively reshoots of the first of the original webisodes. According to director Martin Wood, much of the footage of the webisodes were reshot in a very similar style. The producers decided not to include virtual sets for the first 20 minutes of the episode, in order to lull the audience to a false sense of security, so the production crew filmed on location. The apartment building from the beginning of the episode were shot at the partially decommissioned Riverview mental care facility. Because the producers found the location "creepy", they felt the location could be used to impart this creepiness to the audience. In the 18 months between the webisodes and the series, Wiebe grew taller. The corpses used in the beginning were mannequins the props department had in their possession and put holes in the forehead, and were easier to use than actors.
Like the web series, much of the episodes were filmed on green screen. The production team performed over 480 visual effects shots, compared to 12 visual effects shots from an average "Stargate" episode. Amanda Tapping (also executive producer of the series) described the process of using the green screen like doing theatre, and hasn't used green screen to an extent during her tenure in "Stargate". The opening shot for the premiere took three months for special effects supervisor Lee Wilson's Vancouver-based company to complete.
Reception.
The series premiere received a household rating of 2.2, the highest rated original series premiere from the Sci Fi Channel since the series premiere of "Eureka" in July 2006. The 2.2 rating represented more than 2.7 million viewers; 1.08 million among the adult 18–49 demographic and 1.4 million among the adult 25–54 demographic. This placed "Sanctuary" the number one cable program among adults 25–54, and number four among adults 18–49. The ratings success also boosted the web series to 1.2 million views. In the United Kingdom, both parts placed the series first place on the top ten viewing programmes for ITV4 during the two weeks they aired. The first part was viewed by 565,000, while the second part received a higher viewing figure of 608,000.
Reviews of the pilot were generally positive, where reviewers marked comparisons between "Sanctuary", and other science fiction series such as "Primeval" and "Torchwood", as well as the comparisons between Zimmerman and "Stargate SG-1's" Daniel Jackson. Jason Hughes of "TV Squad" described the episode as "one of the more hyped premieres of recent years on Sci Fi," and thought it made a "nice job of creating a cohesive narrative from the elements of webisodes," as well as praising Christopher Heyerdahl's acting for John Druitt's stereotype as the antagonist. Hughes also dubbed the green screen usage as a resounding success, though he felt that some of the scenes somewhat hindered the pace of the episode. Mark Wilson of "About.com" stated that the synergy between the writers and cast looked promising, and that Robin Dunne's performance is "one who really pulls the viewer into Sanctuary," as well as stating the cast served as eye candy for the viewers, since they consist of guest stars, who made other appearances throughout other series as "Stargate" (Tapping, Heyerdahl, Kavan Smith), "Battlestar Galactica" (Kandyse McClure), "Flash Gordon" (Panou) and "The 4400" (Caiman Wiebe).
Tory Ireland Mell of "IGN" rated the episode a "great" 8.7 out of 10, describing the story as intriguing, and the concept as mind blowing, and though the concept of the series from a production standpoint was executed well, but criticised the seemingly slow pace. Paul Simpson of "Total Sci-Fi" rated the both parts 7/10, and made comparisons of this episode, and "Everything Changes", the pilot episode of "Torchwood". He thought the first part, with such aspects as Heyerdahl's effective acting holds potential for the series, while the second part still reminisces Simpson of "Primeval" and "Torchwood" again, but still holds potential. However, Brian Lowry of "Variety Magazine" has said that the pilot episode was "Uninspiring" and further stated that it didn't "Rock anyone else's world."
The visual effects of the episodes were submitted for three award nominations, one of which was won. In 2009, the first part won a Gemini Award for "Best Visual Effects", beating fellow nominee "The Five". It received a Leo Award nomination for "Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series," but lost to "Stargate Atlantis"' "First Contact". It was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects but lost to "Heroes".

Takachiho Railway

Line.
The company operated one line named the Takachiho Line connecting Nobeoka Station in Nobeoka, Miyazaki and Takachiho Station in Takachiho, Miyazaki. The government authorization of the railway business was abolished for a half of the line in 2007 and for the remaining half in 2008.
History.
The Takachiho Line, originally named the of Japanese Government Railways, opened on February 20, 1935, in the section between Nobeoka Station and Hyūga-Okamoto Station. Following some extensions, the line reached Takachiho Station on July 22, 1972, and was renamed the Takachiho Line same day.
When the national railway was privatized in 1987, the line belonged to JR Kyushu, which withdrew from the operation of the Takachiho Line and transferred it to Takachiho Railway, a new company established by local funds, on April 28, 1989.
On September 6, 2005, flooding triggered by Typhoon Nabi washed away two bridges on the line, halting all operations. By December, it was clear that no government funding for rebuilding was available, and some attempts by local communities to rebuilt the railway went for nothing. A shareholders' resolution made on January 6, 2009, started the company's liquidation procedures which ended in March 2009 with no distribution to shareholders.
Cars.
cars at 2005.
Following the closure of the line, two truck-style sightseeing cars TR401 and TR402 were purchased by JR Kyushu upon an offer from Takachiho Railway. They will be refurbished and used on the new "Umisachi Yamasachi" limited express service on the Nichinan Line from October 2009.
Among ordinary railcars, TR201 was given to Asa Kaigan Railway without compensation. It will go into service in autumn 2009. Other ordinary cars were disused. TR104 and TR105 were given to the town of Hinokage and are preserved at Hinokage-Onsen Station. TR101 and TR202 were given to the town of Takachiho and are preserved at Takachiho Station. Others were scrapped.

The Cowboy Captain of the Cutty Sark is a Scrooge McDuck comic by Don Rosa. The story takes place between "The Buckaroo of the Badlands" and "Raider of the Copper Hill" in the series The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck making it part 3B. This makes little sense, since in the end of part three (Buckaroo of the Badlands), Scrooge is hired to work for Murdo MacKenzie, and in the very beginning of the fourth part (Raider of the Copper Hill) that same employment is ended - making the time for part The Cowboy Captain overlap with his employment on the Mackenzie's farm.
The story take place in August 1883. Scrooge imports some cattle to Indonesia but encounters a thief and meets his old friend Ratchet Gearloose from his Riverboat days. Then he becomes part of a spectacular trip aboard the clipper ship Cutty Sark on August 26, 1883. However, Krakatoa becomes more active, and soon enough, the volcano violently explodes. Scrooge and Gearloose have to ride out the pyroclastic flow, tsunami, and the falling pumice.

Thorbjørn Egners lesebøker

Thorbjørn Egners lesebøker () were a series of sixteen readers for elementary school written by Norwegian author Thorbjørn Egner. Egner spent 25 years working on the seriesconsisting of collected literature as well as his own stories and illustrationsand they were published in the years 1950–1972. The books were intended for children aged 8–15, which at the time corresponded to grades 2nd–9th. Among the recurring characters was the young boy Ola-Ola, who grew up on a farm on the Norwegian countryside, but later moved to the city and had to adapt to a new life. Other stories took place in far-away lands, reminiscent of the environment in Egner's celebrated "People and Robbers of Cardemon Town". There were also a selection of songs and poems in between the stories.
The books took over the role held for decades by the readers of Nordahl Rolfsen in the Norwegian educational system. Rolfsen's books were published in the years 1892–1895, and had been the standard works since, but starting in the 1950s, Egner's books took over this position. Egner himself considered the series to be the "magnum opus" of his collected works. In 1972, howeverthe year when the last book in the series was publishedthe educational program of Norwegian primary schools was altered. The new scheme largely abandoned the use of basic readers in the curriculum. As a result, Egner's textbooks were rendered virtually obsolete as educational tools. The books remain an important part of the Norwegian cultural heritage, being considered children's classics, and some of them have been reprinted more recently.

In February 2007, Yesterdays and Rockszerviz Records organized the first MiniProg Festival (Budapest, Ship A38) in Budapest with two other bands: Flamborough Head from the Netherlands and ex-Yes guitarist Peter Banks' Harmony In Diversity (U.K.).
After some member changes the band worked on some new songs, a 20 minutes long epic for the upcoming Colossus Magazine/Musea release The Spaghetti Epic III and on a 5 minutes progrock hit with Jonas Reingold, the bassist of The Flower Kings, for Dante's Inferno (a new Colossus/Musea project CD box).

Northwestern Field was a football stadium in Evanston, Illinois. It opened in 1905 and was home to the Northwestern Wildcats football team prior to the Dyche Stadium (now known as Ryan Field) opening in 1926. It had a capacity of 10,000 people.
After significant victories during the 1903 season drew large crowds, Northwestern business manager and former Evanston mayor William Dyche lobbied the school for a new stadium, arguing that 1,000 seat Sheppard Field could no longer meet popular demand. A lot northwest of campus was chosen for the project, with construction beginning in 1904 and ending in 1905.

Kjell Almskog

Kjell Erik Almskog (born 5 January 1941) is a Norwegian businessman. He is the former chief executive officer of several companies, including the Norwegian division of the ABB Group and Kværner.
Personal life and education.
He was born in Oslo as a son of company manager Reidar Juel Almskog (1910–1982) and Aslaug Magnhild Carlsen. He finished his secondary education in 1959, and received his MBA from the University of Kansas in 1964. He took the Advanced Management Program at Harvard University from 1974 to 1975.
Career.
He was the brand manager for Procter & Gamble in London from 1967 to 1971, before becoming the marketing director at Simrad from 1971 to 1976. He became a director in Elektrisk Union in 1976 and then chief executive officer of its daughter companies National Industri in 1979, then National Elektro in 1981. In 1986 he became chief executive officer of Elektrisk Bureau, which soon merged with Elektro Union. In 1988 it also merged with ABB. Almskog remained the chief executive of ABB Norway until 1998, and in the autumn he was promoted to vice chief executive at ABB's main headquarters in Switzerland. During his time at ABB, Almskog built up the company's oil and gas division from scratch.
In 1999, Almskog became chief executive officer of Kværner, after Erik Tønseth. Kværner paid a significant sign-on fee. However, Almskog came into conflict with one of the company's main shareholders, Kjell Inge Røkke, as Røkke wanted to remove Almskog from the board of directors, and Almskog left the company in 2001 when Røkke took over the ownership in Kværner. 
Both Almskog's time as Kværner CEO, as well as the circumstances regarding his departure were amidst controversy. Shortly after taking his position at Kværner, Almskog announced that all the company's shipyards would be put up for sale. Former Kværner director Diderik Schnitler blamed Aker Kværner's troubles with the Philadelphia shipyard on this decision. Martin Saarikangas, leader of Kværner Masa Yards, and the shipyard division, labelled Almskog a "wandering catastrophe". When Almskog left Kværner, the company was in economic crisis, but despite this Almskog received a golden parachute worth . Almskog had also received a NOK 600,000 wage increase shortly before leaving.
He has since served on the board of the Orkla Group, and is now the chairman of the board at Intex Resources.

Twins Early Development Study

The Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) is an ongoing longitudinal twin study headed by principal investigator psychologist Robert Plomin and based at King's College London. The main goal of TEDS is to use behavioural genetic methods to find out how nature (genes) and nurture (environments) can explain why people differ with respect to their cognitive abilities, learning abilities and behaviours. Over 15,000 pairs of twins originally signed up for the study and more than 13,000 pairs remain involved to the present day. This demonstrates the continued support of all twins and their families for more than a decade.
The TEDS sample.
Participants were identified from birth records of all twins born in England and Wales between 1994 and 1996. When the twins were around 12 months old, a parent or guardian of the twins was asked to complete a first contact booklet, which listed a comprehensive range of background variables (e.g. information about ethnic origin, job status and educational qualifications). This background information has been updated through the course of the study and has enabled comparisons of the TEDS sample against UK population data and against participants lost to attrition. These comparisons have led to the conclusion that, despite attrition, TEDS continues to be representative of the UK population, e.g. in terms of ethnicity, maternal education, and parental employment status. Zygosity of twins was determined either using parental questionnaires or, in instances where questionnaire results were unclear, by DNA typing. Data has been collected longitudinally at ages 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 16
Main research topics.
TEDS was originally set up with funding from the Medical Research Council in order to investigate the genetic and environmental origins of common cognitive disabilities and abilities, learning disabilities and abilities (e.g. language, reading, mathematical abilities and disabilities) and behaviour problems (e.g. hyperactivity). Although the main focus remains on these topics, TEDS has also looked at other topics such as gender role development, prosocial behaviour, food choices, asthma, and sources of heterogeneity and comorbidity in psychopathology. TEDS’ research also addresses the relationship between ability and disability, i.e. can disability be understood in terms of the extreme end of a continuum of normal variation in ability.
The incorporation of environmental measures (e.g. measures of home and school environment) in genetically sensitive designs allows TEDS to study the interplay between nature and nurture; such as exposure to certain environments for genetic reasons (gene-environment correlation) and differential sensitivity to the environment based on people’s genetic make-up (gene-environment interaction).
Aims.
TEDS follows three major aims.
Major findings and contributions.
Oliver & Plomin (2007) provide an overview of TEDS findings. TEDS has made major contributions to the Genetics and Education literature, such as the formulation of the Generalist Genes Hypothesis of learning abilities and disabilities, and important contributions to the literature on the heritability of IQ and school achievement. Novel findings from TEDS also include the discovery that social and non-social behaviours exhibited by children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) are largely influenced by different genes. With respect to molecular genetics, TEDS has pioneered a novel strategy called SNP Microarrays and Pooling (SNP-MaP), which is a cost-effective and powerful way of genotyping DNA as it allows researchers to use one microarray instead of hundreds to genotype a group’s pooled DNA. It is hoped that it will eventually be possible to use the insights obtained from studies such as TEDS to help prevent or alleviate common learning disabilities such as dyslexia.

<doc id="20372543" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20372543" title="Rollins College Interracial Committee">
Rollins College Interracial Committee

The Rollins College Interracial Committee was a student-run organization at Rollins College with the aim of improving race relations, acting mainly through service projects for the African-American community throughout central Florida. The committee was founded in the mid-1930s. It was renamed to the “Rollins College Race Relations Committee” in 1945. It was renamed to the “Rollins Inter-Faith and Race Relations Committee” between the years 1949 and 1950. Notably, Fred Rodgers, later famous for his role on Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood, served as president during the 1950-1951 school year. The committee was disbanded between 1956 and 1960.
History.
Founding and Early Years.
There is no record of the committee’s existence prior to the 1936-1937 school year, and since several of its future projects (such as the Colored Grammar School and the Hungerford School) were being taken up by other committees until that time, it seems safe to assume that the committee was founded in 1936, when it was officially incorporated into the Knowles Memorial Chapel. Emily Showalter was elected as the first chair. However, there is no record of club activities until the 1938-1939 school year.
Disbanding.
The last available records of the committee are for the 1955-1956 school year. Since the Knowles Memorial Chapel records for the latter half of the 1950s are not available, it is not known precisely when the committee disbanded; however, it was already out of existence before 1960.
Notable Projects.
Hungerford School.
Rollins College organizations were contributing to the Hungerford School in Eatonville, Florida, even before the Interracial Committee came into existence. However, it was placed under the Interracial Committee’s umbrella sometime after its formation. Between 1938 and 1955, the Committee not only contributed regularly (if not yearly, though some years do not have adequate records to bear this out) to the Hungerford School, it consistently contributed the largest chunk of its budget. During that period, the Hungerford School used money donated by the committee to furnish a game room, purchase dining hall equipment, farm equipment, and a laundry ironer, among other things.
Winter Park Negro Grammar School.
The Interracial Committee also contributed to a yearly Christmas party for students at the Winter Park Negro Grammar School beginning in 1938. The extent of the committee’s contribution from year to year is not on record, however, in 1943, a letter from the school indicated that the committee’s $5 contribution that year went toward “a gift and a box of candy for every child” and that other local organizations contributed as well. The Christmas parties continued until the 1954-1955 school year, when no line for the party appeared on the budget report. In addition to the annual Christmas party, the committee paid and arranged for lunches for students for “a limited period” during the 1946-1947 school year when the school encountered a shortage of funds.
Hannibal Square Library.
The Interracial Committee began donating books to the Hannibal Square Library during the 1938-1939 school year, and regularly contributed throughout the committee’s existence.
Annual Race Relations Sundays.
Beginning in 1945, the committee began sponsoring an Annual Race Relations Sunday, a service conducted in February at the Annie Russell Theatre. These Race Relations Sundays were structured like a religious gathering, with a sermon and music; however, films on race relations were often shown as well. Dean Henry M. Edmonds presided over the meetings until 1948, when Dean Theodore S. Darrah took over. Darrah presided over every Race Relations Sunday until at least 1955, the eleventh such event, which is the last recorded meeting. It is unclear whether or not they actually continued further.

<doc id="20372615" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20372615" title="Yarmukian Culture">
Yarmukian Culture

The Yarmukian Culture is a Neolithic culture of the ancient Levant. It was the first culture in Prehistoric Israel and one of the oldest in the Levant to make use of pottery. The Yarmukian derives its name from the Yarmouk River which flows near its type site at Sha'ar HaGolan, a kibbutz at the foot of the Golan Heights.
Sha'ar HaGolan.
The first Yarmukian settlement was unearthed at Megiddo during the 1930s, but was not identified as a distinct Neolithic culture at the time. At Sha'ar HaGolan, in 1949, Prof. Moshe Stekelis first identified the Yarmukian Culture, a Pottery Neolithic culture that inhabited parts of Israel and Jordan. The site, dated to ca. 6400–6000 BC (calibrated), is located in the central Jordan Valley, on the northern bank of the Yarmouk River. Its size is circa 20 hectares, making it one of the largest settlements in the world at that time. Although other Yarmukian sites have been identified since, Sha'ar HaGolan is the largest, probably indicating its role as the Yarmukian center.
The site was excavated by two teams from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem: One led by Stekelis (1949–1952) and the other by Yosef Garfinkel (1989–90, 1996–2004). While during the earlier excavations no architecture was found, the second expedition uncovered large courtyard houses, ranging between 250 and 700 m² in area. The courtyard house makes its first appearance at Sha'ar HaGolan, giving the site a special significance in architectural history. This is an architectural concept still found among traditional Mediterranean societies. Monumental construction on this scale is unknown elsewhere during this period. The houses consist of a central courtyard surrounded by several small rooms. 
The houses were separated by streets, which constitute evidence of advanced community planning. The dig uncovered a central street about 3 m wide, paved with pebbles set in mud, and a narrow winding alley 1 m wide. These are the earliest streets discovered in Israel and among the earliest streets built by man. A 4.15 m well dug to the local water table indicates a knowledge of hydraulics. Exotic objects discovered during the excavations include sea shells from the Mediterranean, polished stone vessels made of alabaster (or marble), and blades made from obsidian (volcanic glass) from Turkey. The presence of obsidian points to trade connections extending over 700 km.
Pottery.
The greatest technological innovation of the Sha'ar HaGolan Neolithic was the manufacture of pottery. This industry, which appears here for the first time in Israel, gives this cultural stage its name of Pottery Neolithic. The pottery vessels are in a variety of shapes and sizes and were put to various domestic uses.
Art.
About 300 art objects were found at Sha'ar HaGolan, making it the main center of prehistoric art in Israel and one of the most important in the world. One of the houses yielded approximately 70 figurines made of stone or fired clay. No other single building of the Neolithic period has yielded that many prehistoric figurines. Among the outstanding art objects from Sha'ar HaGolan are figurines in human form made of fired clay or carved on pebbles. The overwhelming majority are female images, interpreted as representing a goddess. The clay figurines are extravagant in their detail, giving them a surrealistic appearance, while the pebble figurines are minimalist and abstract in form. The members of Kibbutz Sha'ar HaGolan have built a museum that exhibits the finds from the nearby site.

History.
Vakkom Muhammed Abdul Khadir Moulavi alias Vakkom Moulavi founded the weekly newspaper on January 19, 1905, to spearhead the fight against corruption and to struggle for the democratic rights of the people in Travancore. He managed to import, directly from England, an automatic flatbed printing press, the latest type then available. The press operated from "Anjuthengu (Anglican: Anjengo)", a British colony at the time directly ruled by British East India Company.

In July 1907, both the newspaper office and the family moved to Thiruvanthapuram. Though Vakkom Moulavi was still the proprietor, Ramakrishna had been given total freedom in the running of the newspaper by Moulavi. Although there were never any legal or financial contracts between the two, Moulavi provided all the financial aid to set up the press.
On 26 September 1910, the newspaper and the printing press were sealed and confiscated by the British Police. Ramakrishna Pillai was arrested and banished from Travancore to Thirunelveli in Madras Province of British Raj.
In 1957, after the Independence of India, the Government of Kerala returned the press to Moulavi's family and son Abdul Kadar. On 26 January 1968, the then Chief Minister of Kerala, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, presented it to the legal heirs of Maulavi Abdul Qadir at a public meeting, 36 years after his death.

Bhadrapur was a very prosperous city during the 18-1900s. It was renowned for its rice cultivation due to its rich fertile soil, this period saw various rice mills being established led by late Brahma Lal Shrestha who is one of the early founders of the city. The prosperous rice business at that period led Bhadrapur to its most prosperous period. 
Bhadrapur also has various important governmental and other important infrastructures, including a regional hospital, airport, college, Police and Military Headquarters and also hosts the Central District Offices. 
However due to the construction of the East West Highway (north of Bhadrapur), economic activities have also shifted north to the junction of the highway Birtamod, this has left Bhadrapur with a receding population and crippled its once booming economic activity.
In the last decade, Bhadrapur is slowly transforming itself into tea hub with several new plantation and tea factories being established every year. The much awaited Mechi Bridge joining Bhadrapur to India (Galgalia) is also under construction and now acts as a lifeline to the revitalization of Bhadrapur. There is a checkpoint at the border.

Rundbogenstil

Rundbogenstil (Round-arch style), one of the nineteenth-century historic revival styles of architecture, is a variety of Romanesque revival popular in the German-speaking lands and the German diaspora.
History and description.
The style was the deliberate creation of German architects seeking a German national style of architecture, particularly Heinrich Hübsch (1795–1863). It emerged in Germany as a response to and reaction against the neo-Gothic style that had come to the fore in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. By adopting the smooth facade of late antique and medieval church architecture, it aimed to extend and develop the noble simplicity and quiet grandeur of neo-classicism, while moving in a direction more suited to the rise of industrialism and the emergence of German nationalism.
Hallmarks of the style, in addition to the rounded arches from which it takes its name, include "eyebrows" over the windows and inverted crenelation under the eaves.
"Rundbogenstil" was employed for a number of railway stations, including those in Karlsruhe, Leipzig, Munich, Tübingen, and Völklingen. These were typically "first generation" stations (built between 1835 and 1870); some were razed to be replaced by larger buildings. Those in Tübingen and Völklingen are still extant, while the Bayerischer Bahnhof in Leipzig is partially preserved.
"Rundbogenstil" was also widely employed in synagogue architecture. The first in this style was the Kassel Synagogue designed by Heinrich Hübsch with Albrecht Rosengarten, built in the latter's native city Kassel, Hesse-Kassel, in 1839. An early example in the United States is the Gates of Heaven Synagogue in Madison, Wisconsin, built in 1863 and designed by August Kutzbock, an immigrant from Bremen, Germany. Kutzbock also (co)designed secular buildings employing "Rundbogenstil", such as the Carrie Pierce House (1857) in Madison. It was restored in 2008 and adapted for use as a boutique hotel, known as the Mansion Hill Inn.

Mystery (lugger)

Mystery was a Mount's Bay lugger which made a voyage to Australia in 1854/55. Her passage to Cape Town was so fast that she was commissioned to take mail from there to Australia.
History.
Mystery was a Mount's Bay lugger used for fishing inshore waters. In 1854, seven Cornishmen decided to try their luck in finding gold in Australia. As they were all shareholders in the boat, it was suggested that "Mystery" be sold to cover their passage to Australia, but the captain, Richard Nicholls said that he would take them to Australia in "Mystery".
The boat was prepared for the long sea voyage by covering the hull in zinc, and adding decking fore and aft. They left Newlyn or Penzance (sources vary) on 18 November 1854, passing Madeira on 25 November and San Antonio on 3 December. After this, "Mystery" encountered some bad weather, and her jib split. The Equator was crossed on 15 December. Trinidad was passed on 23 December and on 26 December communication was made with the brig "Callao", which was bound for Liverpool. A letter was entrusted to her captain giving details of their journey so far. The Cape of Good Hope was sighted on 17 January, and Cape Town was reached the next day, after a journey of 60 days. The Harbour Master thought that "Mystery" was a local boat and did not board her until the crew beached the boat with ease.
Five days were spent at Cape Town repairing "Mystery" and replenishing supplies. They had made such good time to Cape Town that the Royal Mail commissioned them to take post on to Australia. For the first few days out of Cape Town the weather was bad, but "Mystery" was unscathed. Further gales were encountered on 18 and 23 February and 3 March. Cape Northumberland was sighted on 9 March and "Mystery" reached Melbourne on 14 March 1855 after a journey of . "Mystery" remained in Australia, where she was used as a pilot cutter. On 26 March 1869, she was wrecked in Keppel Bay, Rockhampton, Queensland. All crew were saved.
Crew.
The crew who made the voyage were Richard Badcock, William Badcock, Charles Boase, Job Kelynack, Lewis Lewis, Philip Curnow Matthews and Richard Nicholls (captain). Two of the crew, Lewis and Matthews settled in Australia. The other five returned home.
Replica.
In 2008, yachtsman Pete Goss commissioned Cornish boat designer and builder Chris Rees to build a replica of the "Mystery" with the intention of recreating the journey. The replica is named "Spirit of Mystery". The "Spirit of Mystery" sailed from Newlyn on 20 October 2008. She arrived in Cape Town on 25 December 2008. "Spirit of Mystery" arrived in Melbourne on 9 March 2009.

Skint &amp; Demoralised

Skint & Demoralised (2007-2013) were a UK lyric-based alternative indie/pop act, fronted by 24-year-old lyricist Matt Abbott from Wakefield, West Yorkshire and produced by MiNI dOG from Sheffield, South Yorkshire.
Early years and formation.
Skint & Demoralised began when Wakefield teenager Matt Abbott started doing stand-up performance poetry in late 2006. With comical themes such as tales from Seaside towns and tragic nights-out, he was often a hit with a pleasantly surprised audience. This was mainly in the West Yorkshire area, and included support slots for Reverend and the Makers, Last Gang and The Research. He also performed for Love Music Hate Racism and his unusual style soon earned him a name locally.
Abbott temporarily ceased to perform poetry when he was contacted on MySpace by MiNI dOG, with whom he began to write. MiNI dOG began to turn Abbott's poetry into songs by chopping them apart and laying them over backing tracks before the two had even met. However, after meeting the pair developed a strong songwriting partnership, with Abbott writing lyrics and MiNI dOG writing the music and producing the demos. His poetry soon evolved into a more lyrical style, although the spoken word delivery and also the style in which they are written remained very true to his poetic beginning.
After uploading demos onto MySpace, free download sites and also posting CDs out to DJs, the band were played and interviewed on various radio shows including Steve Lamacq on BBC Radio 1 and BBC 6 Music, Shamir Masri's 'Raw Talent' on BBC Radio Sheffield and on Yorkshire Radio. The band also received airplay on BBC Radio 1 from Colin Murray and Huw Stephens and played a Maida Vale live session for Steve Lamacq on 3 March 2008.
One of the most notable features of the band's initial success was the sheer volume of free downloads from their site. Demo recordings were uploaded as soon as they were finished and from June 2007 to March 2008 they had over 8600 downloads in total.
Having originally planned to release a limited edition single on Stiff Records, the band signed to Mercury Records on 18 March (part of the Universal Music Group). However, over the summer of 2010 the act parted company with the label.
Live performances.
With a live band of musicians from the Sheffield area, Skint & Demoralised only performed ten gigs before signing their record deal, all of which were in Sheffield and Wakefield.
Their first headline Tour was in February 2009 and included dates in Sheffield, Glasgow, Manchester, Oxford, Birmingham, Brighton, London, Leeds and finally Southampton. One particular feature of the live set included Matt Abbott's spoken word poems. During this Tour, he would perform the anti-racism poem "BNP: Nazis on the Doorstep" without a microphone and usually climbed on top of a nearby monitor or fixture to do so, thus raising him a few feet above the crowd.
He has supported and performed with Love Music Hate Racism since he very first began and has often spoken of his support for the organisation in interviews as well as in Blogs.
In March 2009 he supported one of his main idols - John Cooper Clarke - at The Duchess in York as part of a string of Spring dates before the next single campaign, including many headline shows across the North of England.
The band performed at several new music festivals in 2009 such as Camden Crawl in London and The Great Escape in Brighton as well as major festivals such as Glastonbury Festival, Wireless Festival in Hyde Park, London, Latitude Festival in Suffolk, Leeds and Reading Festival and Bestival on the Isle of Wight.
Over the summer of 2010, Abbott performed several Stand-up comedy gigs which included dates at Latitude Festival and Leeds Festival.
Debut album 'Love, And Other Catastrophes'.
Skint & Demoralised began recording their debut album "Love And Other Catastrophes" in June 2008 with legendary Funk/Soul session band The Dap-Kings at The Daptone Studios in Brooklyn, New York. The Dap-Kings are most known in the UK for their work on Amy Winehouse's "Back to Black" album and Mark Ronson's "Version".
The second half of the session was at RAK Studios in St John's Wood, London and the album's producer was MiNI dOG. MiNI dOG also mixed eight of the tracks, with the other four being mixed by Jeremy Wheatley.
However, the album was leaked online months before it was due to be released, which included full-length promotional copies being sold on eBay and large numbers of downloads through illegal file sharing. It was never officially released by Mercury Records, but was eventually released by indie label Heist Or Hit alongside the band's second album "This Sporting Life" in summer 2011.
The album was released on 12" vinyl, including exclusive bonus tracks, by German indie label Firestation Records in 2011.
Critical acclaim.
Skint & Demoralised enjoyed critical acclaim from a very early stage in their career, and in particular it was the praise of BBC Radio 1/BBC Radio 2/BBC 6 Music DJ Steve Lamacq that led to them gaining attention from several major labels. They received national airplay from Lamacq as well as his fellow BBC Radio 1 DJs Huw Stephens and Colin Murray before they were signed and performed a live session for Lamacq at the Maida Vale Studios in March 2008.
Their first national acclaim in the press came in August 2008 as a "Next Big Thing" from "Q" Magazine; an accolade soon followed by "Clash Magazine", "The Independent", "The Scottish Sun" and "The Sunday Times' Culture" magazine before the end of 2008, as well as several online journals.
"The Guardian" also named them as their 'New Band of the Day' on 12 January 2009.
The infamous "3am Girls" in the "Daily Mirror" are also early supporters of the band, and when they released their first single they enjoyed many national radio plays on BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, Xfm and Absolute Radio as well as being on the B-List at BBC 6 Music. DJs such as Sara Cox, Zane Lowe, Colin Murray, Huw Stephens, Steve Lamacq, Nick Grimshaw, Annie Mac, Dermot O'Leary, Janice Long, and Chris Moyles have expressed their support for the act.
As well as a TV appearance and performance on "Loose Women", they enjoyed national airplay over the summer of 2009 with their single "Red Lipstick", spending several weeks on the BBC Radio 1 B-List and being chosen as the "Weekend Anthem" by Sara Cox.
Political activism.
Matt Abbott has been a keen supporter of the non-profit Love Music Hate Racism movement since performing spoken word at one of their gigs in April 2007. He performs a spoken word piece at every gig entitled 'Nazis on the Doorstep' which criticises the basis of the British National Party's policies and constantly speaks out against them in interviews and on his social network sites.
Through working with LMHR he has performed at and helped to organised gigs and carnivals nationwide, delivered workshops in schools across the Yorkshire area around election time and given talks at the Unite Against Fascism National Conferences in London.
He has also worked with trade unions such as GMB, particularly around the 2009 Leeds refuse workers strike. Despite being an active member of the Liberal Democrats at the age of 16 and strongly opposing the Iraq War, Abbott is now a committed voter for the Labour Party.
Reformation in 2010 and second album 'This Sporting Life'.
On 21 September 2010, Abbott announced via his Twitter and Facebook pages that the band would be reforming, after it was initially announced over a year ago that they had split up in favour of a solo project from Abbott. A second album was written and recorded in the last few months of the year at MiNI dOG's home studio in Sheffield.
Videos were made for demo tracks from the second album, setting the songs to stills from Abbott's favourite films including "A Taste of Honey", "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning", "L'Appartement", "Amélie" and "Trainspotting".
With a new band composed of Abbott's closest friends from Wakefield, live dates began to gather pace over spring 2011 and the band announced that they'd signed a deal with Indie label Heist Or Hit Records. Both the band's new album "This Sporting Life" and their previously unreleased debut "Love And Other Catastrophes" were released as a 2CD Bonus Edition on 2 August 2011.
The new album was named after the 1963 Wakefield based kitchen-sink drama of the same name, and was recorded at MiNI dOG's home studio between August and November 2010.
Third and final album 'The Bit Between The Teeth'.
On 1 August 2012, Abbott again officially announced via his Twitter and Facebook feeds that the band was planning to release a third album. He then officially revealed the title of the album to be 'The Bit Between The Teeth' in an interview with a Canadian music site in August 2012.
An official announcement detailing the band's first single release was made on the record label's official website on 11 February 2013. In the same announcement, the release date for the album was given as 8 April 2013.
Early reaction to the single 'Breakfast at Sylvia's' was positive, including a review on indie music site AltSounds.com which praised Matt Abbott's lyrics as well as acclaim from Art Brut lyricist/frontman Eddie Argos. The band decided in July 2013 that this album would be their last as Skint & Demoralised.

Gulabi Gang

The Gulabi gang (from Hindi गुलाबी "gulabī", "pink") is a group of Indian women vigilantes and activists originally from Bundelkhand, Uttar Pradesh, but reported to be active across North India as of 2010.
History.
The Gulabi gang was founded by Sampat Pal Devi, a mother of five and former government health worker (as well as a former child bride), as a response to widespread domestic abuse and other violence against women. "Gulabis" visit abusive husbands and beat them up with "laathis" (bamboo sticks) unless they stop abusing their wives. 
In 2008, they stormed an electricity office in Banda district and forced officials to turn back on the power they had cut in order to extract bribes. They have also stopped child marriages and protested dowry and female illiteracy.
The group, which the Indian media portray positively, was reported to have 20,000 members as of 2008, as well as a chapter in Paris, France.
In popular culture.
The Gulabi gang is the subject of the 2010 movie "Pink Saris" by Kim Longinotto as is the 2012 documentary "Gulabi Gang" by Nishtha Jain. 
Initially, it was reported that the Bollywood film, "Gulaab Gang", starring Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla as leads, is based on Sampat Pal's life, but the director denied this, saying that he is obliged to her work but the movie is not based on her life.

Panchajanya

Panchajanya is the Shankha conch of the Hindu god Vishnu. Krishna, the avatar of Vishnu, is described possessing a shankha called Panchajanya, one of his four attributes together with the mace Kaumodaki, the disc-like weapon Sudarshana Chakra and a lotus flower. The conch was used during the Kurukshetra War.
Panchajanya or Shankhasur was an evil sea demon who lived in a colossal conch shell in the deepest depths of the Prabhasa ocean or was a demon in the form of a conch shell. He kidnapped the son of Sandipani, the guru of Shri Krishna, Balarama and Sudama, and imprisoned him in the conch shell. Upon completion of their studies, Krishna, Balarama, and Sudama persuaded the teacher to ask for the preceptor’s dakshina (fees) of his liking. Sandipani asked for, as his dakshina, the restoration of his child. Krishna became enraged when he heard about the kidnap and plunged into the sea to rescue the son of Sandipani. Krishna successfully slew Shankhasur and took the conch shell for himself. He then named the conch shell after the Demon. Whenever Krishna blows from the shell it foreshadows the death of his next opponent.

The club has 2 sections: a men's soccer team that plays in Group I of Preferente and their female division boasts the club's only team playing football in a national division. The top team for women plays in the Segunda División Femenina, formerly part of the Superliga Femenina.
History.
The team base is at 2 other clubs in Torrejon, "the AD Torrejón" and the "Torrejón CF", who decided to merge in the year 2001 to form a single professional team in the League, the AD Torrejón CF. The clubs trace their emergence back to 1953 when CD Torrejon first was established. 
The men's team managed to debut for the first time in Tercera División in the 2003-04 season, achieving a good sixth place, and remained in that category 2 seasons until the team fell. In the 2006-07 Torrejon was the leader of their group in Preferente, so he returned to Tercera Division. Currently struggle for permanence.
Stadium.
The AD Torrejón FC plays its matches in "The Veredillas Stadium." The field, located in Torrejón de Ardoz, it has capacity for 1,500 people.
Women's Soccer.
AD Torrenjón's section of female football campaigned in the Superliga Femenina, the highest level in Spain, between 2002 and 2011. The section was opened in 1996, and in its first year was regional champion, quickly ascending to the Superliga. His greatest achievement came in the 1998-99 season, when the Torrejon CF was runner-up Spain. The first team is coached by Laura Perez Torviscas.
In its staff came to play in the year 2002 Milene Domingues, ex-wife Ronaldo and considered one of the best female soccer players.

ModeFRONTIER

modeFRONTIER is a multi-objective optimization and design environment, written to couple CAD/computer aided engineering (CAE) tools, finite element structural analysis and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. It is developed by 'ESTECO SpA [http://www.esteco.com]' and provides an environment for product engineers and designers. modeFRONTIER is a GUI driven software written in Java that wraps around the CAE tool, performing the optimization by modifying the value assigned to the input variables, and analyzing the outputs as they can be defined as objectives and/or constraints of the design problem.
History.
ESTECO was created in 1999 to transfer the knowledge acquired by its founders while working on a European Union sponsored project on Design Optimization (FRONTIER, started in 1996) into a commercial product, called modeFRONTIER. In 2001, modeFRONTIER version 2.4 become a global player among the MDO/PIDO tools, being one of the first to enable true multi-objective optimization through Pareto dominance criteria.
Process integration.
The logic of the optimization loop can be set up in a graphical way, building up a "workflow" structure by means of interconnected nodes. Serial and parallel connections and conditional switches are available. modeFRONTIER builds automatic chains and steers many different external application programs using scripting (DOS script, UNIX shell, Python programming language, Visual Basic, JavaScript,etc...) and direct integration nodes (with many CAE/CAD and other application programs).
Design optimization.
modeFRONTIER includes design of experiments (DOE), optimization algorithms and robust design tools, that can be combined and blended to build up the most efficient strategy to solve complex multi-disciplinary problems.
Design of experiments.
Different strategies are available, including random generator sequences, Factorial DOEs, Orthogonal and Iterative Techniques, as like as D-Optimal or Cross Validation. Monte Carlo and Latin hypercube are available for robustness analysis.
Multi objective algorithms.
Among the others, different implementations of heuristic optimization methods such as the Genetic Algorithm, Game Theory, Simulated Annealing, Evolution strategies are able to manage continuous, discrete and mixed variable problems. More classical mono-objective algorithms are as well available, as like as Gradient-based methods or Simplex algorithm. 
Three multi-strategy methods were also added: the FAST algorithm (using the Response surface methodology to accelerate the iterations to reach the optimum), the Hybrid method (combining global search and local refinement) and the SAnGeA (adding an automatic screening phase to manage high-dimension and unconstrained problems).
Response surfaces.
Different Response surface methodology techniques are available to generate reliable meta-models able to approximate the multivariate input/output behavior of complex systems; this is particularly useful when the optimization applies to problems where every fitness function evaluation is time-expensive.Single Value Decomposition and Polynomial Responses are implemented, as well as the more sophisticated Kriging, Neural Network and Gaussian process ones.
Data processing and multiple criteria decision making (MCDM).
This set of tools enables the user to explore, filter and rank the set of optimal solutions of a multi-objective problem (the so-called Pareto frontier), to perform sensitivity analyses, robustness verifications and also to produce standard and customizable reports of the optimization project (RTF, PDF, HTML formats). The MCDM algorithms enable what-if analysis by providing runtime a ranking of design also when importance of attributes is not made explicit or the probability associated with alternatives cannot be calculated by the decision maker.
Robust design optimization.
This is the latest step of MDO towards 6 Sigma: optimizing a design taking into account uncertainties and tolerances. This consists of investigating the noise factors in the neighborhood of a sample design with a given probability distribution through a multi-objective optimization algorithm aimed at optimizing mean values while minimizing their variations. RSM techniques can be used to overcome the increase in time-expense due to this extensive statistic approach.

Ethnicities in Surunga are Bahun, Chhetri, Satar, Kami, Damai,Newar, bhujel, Tamang, Agrawal, Rajbanshi, Dhimal, Sarki, Magar, Rai and Limbu among others. Out of all the ethnicities, Satar and Rajbanshi are underprivileged in Surunga.
Education.
In education, Surunga is lauded due to its government-run "Kankai Madhyamik Vidyalaya" which caters for around 3,000 students every year not only from Surunga but also from surrounded villages and boarding schools, which are plenty in Surunga. The boarding schools are Shree Pashupati English Boarding School,Shree Harikul Model Higher Secondary School,Paragon Academy, Champa Flowers Academy, Jhapa Marigold English School, Mai valley English School and Dibyaratna English School.
There are other primary boarding schools in Surunga. For higher education, Kankai Multiple Campus is running courses for certificate, bachelors and masters levels. Harikul Model Higher Secondary School also runs higher secondary education also known as 10+2.
Kankai Secondary School is the pioneer school in Surunga.
Economy.
Surunga's main economy rests on agriculture. However, now remittance, local businesses and tourism also contribute significant amount to the economy of Surunga village. In recent times, real estate business is also a vital means of economic activities. The cost of land is increasing each day making about 5 million for one "Kattha" in main points of Surunga. It contains a group of A graded banks certified by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) which includes NRB, BiratLaxmi Bank, Excel Bank etc. NMC (Nepal multipurpose Cooperative Society),prithivi saving and credit society. And simultaneously a group of 'saving and credit' companies are also working handsomely. Leading among them is Bhagwati Saving and Credit Pvt Limited which has more than 200 share members.
Koti Hom (a hom ritual in Hindu religion) was conducted by Late Yogi Naraharinath, a Hindu yogi and philosopher, in 1985. Now Koti Hom is going to be developed as a tourist place. Movie shooting and photo-shooting can be done there paying a little charge in KotiHom Dharmik Sthal Bikash Samiti (a committee which manages the Koti Hom area).
Surunga- No bandas
Surunga is one of the best place for business opportunities because of its anti strike stance. It is one of the most important educational and business centers in the region. No political parties, ethnic groups or professional organization has been able to shut down Surunga bazaar over the last few years. Defying all manner of bandas, Surunga has earned a reputation as the country´s only anti-banda town. The locals say Surunga bazaar has not been closed down even for a single day in the last six years. According to District Traffic Police Office Jhapa, the district has seen shutdowns for 31 days in the last two years. But, no banda has had any impact in Surunga. In the past, the locals of Surunga have even chased away political party cadres trying to shut down the bazaar by force(2).
Religious and touristic sites.
Surunga is famous for Kotihome Religious Region that lies on the westernmost point of the VDC. Every year hundreds of thousands of devotees flock to this area to worship. The most remarkable occasion is Makar Sankranti when maghe mela is organized which is attended by hundreds of thousand people from as far as Biratnagar, Dharan, Itahari, Ilam, Kakarvitta and Indian states of west Bengal (mostly Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri), southern Bhutan and Assam.
Daumukha is a tourist destination of eastern part of Nepal. With Kankai river flowing through the chure range of hills, comes reaches the plains of Terai region. Because of the Daumukha Dam that was constructed to build Kankai Nahar (canal), there's a huge reservoir of water which is serene and clear most of the year. Many youngsters visit this place for picnic, field visit, excursions and simply to cool off from the scorching heat. Daumukha is also a connecting point to Surunga for people living in high hills and southern Ilam. According to mythology, around this area used to be the palace of Kirant King in the history.
These days another religious place Dhanushkoti dham has be found out which is supposed to be place of "Arjun's meditation in The Mahabharat".This is also growing as one the important religious place and more fascinating fact about it is that this lies just the opposite bank of Damukha.
Kankai Bridge: The bridge over the Kankai river is the longest concrete bridge in the country and measures 703 meters. The longest barrage/dam is on Koshi river and the longest bailey bridge is on Mahakali river connecting rest of Nepal to the 2 Nepali villages beyond Mahakali called Chandani and Dodhara villages.
Health services.
Surunga has a government-run primary health care center that is staffed by a medical doctor, health assistant, AHW, Nurses and peons. The PHC also has vaccination center for Snake bite which is highly prevalent condition in the region especially by Cobra and Karet. Besides, there are a lot of pharmacy stores Sitaula Pharmacy, Rai Pharmacy, Pradhan Medical, Asmita Medical etc. that mostly sell medicines to the people and also provide consultation related to medical conditions with the help of medical doctors which rotate on hourly basis. Recently, Marigold Hospital has been set up to cater to the growing health needs of the people. However, there is no medical institution in Surunga that can provide inpatient services to the people. When they have major health problems, the citizens of Surunga run either to Damak, a bigger city in western Jhapa that has AMDA clinic or to Dharan BPKIHS where the largest medical institution of Eastern Nepal is situated. Some of the people also travel as far as Siliguri, second largest city in West Bengal state of India for better treatment. People also travel to Kathmandu for treatment.
Drinking water:
Surunga has drinking water supply that is collected from underground water and treated before distributed to the taps in every house. This was constructed by the initiative of Local people and support from the district development committee. The drinking water project covers most part of the VDC. It is also ranked one of the best drinking water service in the Eastern Region of Nepal. Prior to this, people used to drink water from tube-well that was not treated before drinking and contained a lot harmful minerals for health including Arsenic that is linked with cancers and other skin conditions.

Zhang Chunhua

Zhang Chunhua (189-247) was the wife of Sima Yi, a prominent politician, general and regent of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. She was posthumously honoured as "Empress Xuanmu" in 265 by her grandson Sima Yan, who ended the Cao Wei regime and established the Jin Dynasty that year.
Life.
Zhang Chunhua was a native of Pinggao (平臯), Henei (河內), which is in present-day Wen County, Henan. Her father Zhang Wang (張汪) served as the Prefect (令) of Suyi (粟邑) in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. Her mother, whose maiden family name was "Shan" (山), was a grandaunt of Shan Tao (one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove). In her youth, Zhang Chunhua was already known for her good moral conduct, intelligence and wisdom.
Zhang Chunhua married Sima Yi in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. She bore Sima Yi three sons — Sima Shi, Sima Zhao and Sima Gan (司馬幹). She also bore him a daughter whose personal name was not recorded in history, but was known as "Princess Nanyang" (南陽公主) in the Jin Dynasty.
Once, the warlord Cao Cao (who had become the "de facto" head of the Han government) wanted to recruit Sima Yi into the civil service, but Sima lied that he was ill and stayed at home. One day, while Sima Yi was drying his books under the sun, there was a sudden downpour, so Sima immediately rushed out to collect his books. The incident was witnessed by one of Sima Yi's maids. Zhang Chunhua was worried that the maid would leak out news that Sima Yi was well and get their family into trouble, so she killed the maid to silence her. She then personally prepared meals for the family, and Sima Yi was very impressed with her.
In his later years, Sima Yi favoured his concubine Lady Bai (柏夫人) and started neglecting Zhang Chunhua. Once, when Sima Yi was ill, Zhang Chunhua visited him, and he said to her, "Old creature, your looks are disgusting! Why do you even bother to visit me?" Zhang Chunhua was angry and she attempted to starve herself to death and her sons did also. Sima Yi was shocked and he immediately apologised to his wife and they reconciled. Sima Yi later secretly told someone, "It doesn't matter if that old creature died. I was actually worried about my boys!"
Zhang Chunhua died in 247 at the age of 59 (by East Asian age reckoning). She was buried at Gaoyuanling (高原陵; somewhere in present-day Yanshi, Luoyang, Henan). The Wei emperor Cao Fang granted her the posthumous title of "Lady of Guangping County". In 264, during the reign of Cao Huan, she was given the posthumous name "Consort Xuanmu". A year later, Sima Yi's grandson Sima Yan forced Cao Huan to abdicate in his favour and established the Jin Dynasty to replace the state of Cao Wei. Sima Yan became emperor and he posthumously honoured his grandmother as "Empress Xuanmu".
Modern references.
Zhang Chunhua is first introduced as a playable character in the eighth instalment of Koei's "Dynasty Warriors" video game series.

LB&amp;SCR H1 class

The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway H1 class was a class of 4-4-2 steam locomotives for express passenger work. They were designed by D. E. Marsh and were built by Messrs Kitson & Co. in 1905 and 1906
History.
Prior to taking up office as the Locomotive Superintendent of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1905, Douglas Earle Marsh had worked for the Great Northern Railway at Doncaster Works. There he had been involved in the design of the Klondyke class designed by Henry Ivatt in 1897. There was an urgent need for new large express passenger locomotives for the LB&SCR and so he obtained a set of drawings from Doncaster, and made only detailed amendments before ordering them from the manufacturer. He did however increase the boiler pressure from .
Performance.
The class soon proved to be successful working the London to Brighton express trains including the heavily loaded Pullman services the "Brighton Limited", and The Southern Belle, which the LB&SCR described as "the most luxurious train in the World".
Superheating.
In May 1920 L. B. Billinton wished to install the Schmidt superheater to improve the efficiency of the class, but was refused permission to do so by the Brighton Locomotive Committee. This modification was however carried out by Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway during 1925–1926 after the "Grouping" of 1923.
Re-allocation and naming.
During 1925 and 1926 the H1 class were gradually replaced on the London-Brighton express trains by the "King Arthur" and "River" classes, but there was still plenty of work for them on other express services, including the boat trains connecting with the Newhaven-Dieppe ferry service. At the same time they were all named after geographical features of the south coast.
Withdrawal.
Following the cessation of the cross-channel ferries after 1940, as a result of the Second World War the class were left with little work to do and several were put into store or else moved to miscellaneous duties in southern England, and the first members of the class were withdrawn in 1944.
In July 1947 No. 2039 was experimentally rebuilt with sleeve valves by Oliver Bulleid as a mobile test bed in preparation for his Leader class locomotives. It was never returned to its original state and in common with the remainder of the class had been withdrawn by 1951. None have survived.

Lejaren Hiller, Sr.

Lejaren Hiller, Sr./Lejaren à Hiller/John Hiller (1880 - 1969), was an accomplished American illustrator and photographer. Born "John Hiller", he changed his name to "Lejaren à Hiller" when he moved from Milwaukee to New York City.
He studied painting and illustration at the Chicago Art Institute and travelled to Paris where he found work in a number of studios. By the early 1900s his attention turned to photography and he was widely regarded as the ""creator of American photographic illustration"."
Hiller was known for dramatically staged tableaux. He would spend considerable time and effort in arranging the set and models, while an assistant took the photograph, making Hiller's contribution more directorial than photographic. He was more interested in the final result than the means used to achieve it and is remembered for saying:
""If a man wants to strangle his wife and throw her in the kitchen sink, let him do it any way he wants to. If he's doing it awkwardly, or not the way I'd do it, all right -- it's a good job so long as he gets her into the sink, completely strangled.""
From 1927-50 Hiller was commissioned by Davis & Geck to produce the prints for a series of historic advertisements entitled "“Sutures in Ancient Surgery,”" and published in 1944 as "“Surgery through the Ages”". Hiller used elaborate costumes, dramatic backdrops and lighting, and had half-clad models posing as patients. The images depicted a broad range from mediaeval and Aztec surgeons, to surgeons from ancient Egypt and India. The collection was widely acclaimed, and in 1937 won the Edward Bok Award for advertising. The originals of this series were donated to the Art Institute of Chicago.
Hiller also created a series of photographic posters for the US Armed Forces during World War II.
His son, also Lejaren Hiller (1924-1994), was a chemist of psychedelic drugs such as mescaline and celebrated music composer, who pioneered the use of computers in composing.

Multidimensional panel data

In econometrics, panel data is data observed over two dimensions (typically, time and cross-sections). A panel data set is termed "multidimensional" when the phenomenon is observed over three or more dimensions. An example is a data set containing forecasts produced by multiple individuals (the first dimension) forecasting multiple macroeconomic variables (the second dimension) at multiple time horizons (the third dimension) and for multiple target periods (the fourth dimension).
Analysis of panel data.
A multidimensional panel with four dimensions can have the form
where "i" is the individual dimension, "s" is the series dimension, "t" is the time dimension, and "h" is the horizon dimension. A general multidimensional panel data regression model is written as
Complex assumptions can be made on the precise structure of the correlations among errors in this model. For example, serial correlation (error terms correlated across time) has multiple distinct meanings. Error terms can be correlated across time for the same series, individual, and horizon. They can be correlated across time and across series for the same individual and horizon, etc. Similarly, heteroskedasticity can be defined across individuals for the same series, time, and horizon, across individuals and different series for the same time and horizon, etc.

Immigration to Barbados

In more recent history Barbados comparatively is experiencing increased levels of immigration than some of its nearby neighbours in the Caribbean region.
History.
The British that first landed in Barbados recorded that there were no persons living in Barbados at the time of landing at James Town in the 17th century. The British Government next sent large numbers of persons from Scotland to the island, many were indentured servants sent in order to work off or settle debts owed to the British Government.
In the years that followed, Jewish migrants from the then Dutch controlled areas of modern-day Brazil sought safe passage to Barbados.
As the Jewish community brought their advanced agricultural technology to Barbados, plantations boomed with introduction of Sugar cane. This led to large groups of African people being brought to Barbados as slaves. Large numbers of African descendants began to outnumber the Europeans, who were represented by large numbers of Irish people from Ireland was then under British rule. 
Some European immigration came to Barbados in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries: the French, Germans, Greeks, Italians, Portuguese and Russians escaped the Soviet government among them. 
In the years that followed groups of East Indians, Europeans, and a small community of Asians and Middle Easterners (Lebanese and Syrians) developed their own communities in Barbados in the late 20th century.
In April 2012 the Prime Minister of Barbados held the first official new citizens ceremony at the Llyod Erskine Sandiford Centre in St. Michael. In November 2012 the second new citizens ceremony took place. [http://www.nationnews.com/index.php/articles/view/new-citizens-take-the-oath/
Travel to Barbados.
Nationals of CARICOM member states, the USA, Canada, the UK, and some Commonwealth countries can travel directly to Barbados with acceptable proof of nationality and identity (a valid passport from their country and/or original birth certificate with national photo identification) and may be admitted for a period not exceeding three months. All visitors are required to have onward or return tickets.
Recent information from the Immigration Department indicates that CARICOM skilled nationals are required to arrive in Barbados with return airline tickets until they have been formally registered with the Immigration Department as such. The registration process can take up to four weeks to complete, and includes submitting to the Immigration Department a registration form (available at the Immigration Department or at the BIDC), along with the following documentation:

While studying in London, Plumb married Joan Lawrence, a long-time close friend. Plumb's works reflected his admiration for American Color Field painting and hard-edge painting. In the mid-1960s Plumb produced paintings with large fields of a single color; with narrow, strips on the edge of different colors intended to optically enhance the emotional impact of the central, major, and usually intense hue. He taught at Bennington College in Vermont in 1968 and 1969. When he died, Plumb was 81 years old.

Todd Boulanger

Todd Boulanger is an American lobbyist. He was senior vice president of Cassidy & Associates and was a figure in the Jack Abramoff scandal.
Background.
Boulanger graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a degree in political science, and served in the U.S. Army Reserves for eight years.
Early career.
In 1999 Boulanger followed Jack Abramoff to work for Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds, and then in 2001 to Greenberg Traurig as a member of "Team Abramoff", and finally in 2004 to Cassidy & Associates.
In 2000 Boulanger served on the Bush recount team for Broward and Duval counties during the Florida election recount. His Greenberg Traurig online profile heralded his involvement; fellow Team Abramoff members Shawn Vasell, Tony Rudy, and Duane Gibson also participated.
Boulanger was also a legislative aide to Senator Bob Smith.
Abramoff scandal.
While working for Abramoff in 2002, Todd Boulanger drafted a letter to Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton on behalf of the Louisiana Coushatta against the Jena Band of Choctaws from Louisiana, who were hoping to build a casino near the Coushatta's own. His original draft said to Norton: "we hold you accountable" to shoot down "reservation shopping" by the Jenas. In June, Norton received a toned-down letter, signed by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and Majority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).
Billing records and emails indicate Boulanger had 31 instances of lobbying contacts with the White House while at Greenberg. On February 21, 2002, for example, Susan Ralston e-mailed Boulanger in reference to briefing materials opposing the construction of a casino in Louisiana by the Jena Band of the Choctaw: “Thanks for breakfast. I 
showed KR the binder . . . . He gave the binder to Mehlman to read cover to cover and to be prepared. Mehlman will be at the meeting.”
Emails also show that Boulanger was involved with Abramoff, Kevin Ring, Shawn Vasell and Tony Rudy in the Team Abramoff efforts to secure $16.3 million in funding from the Department of Justice for the construction of a jail by the Mississippi Band of the Choctaw. Documents released with Boulanger's guilty plea include emails by Boulanger, Abramoff, and Ring discussing giving "Staffer E" -- identified by the Associated Press as Sen. Thad Cochran aide Ann Copland -- tickets for ice skating and Paul McCartney and Green Day concerts. The lobbyists believed Copland could assist their client, the Mississippi Choctaw.
Boulanger was identified as "Lobbyist D" in the plea agreement of Trevor Blackann, a former staffer for Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.) who pleaded guilty on November 20, 2008 to making false statements about thousands of dollars in gifts from Boulanger and fellow lobbyist James Hirni. Boulanger resigned from Cassidy & Associates the following day.
On January 28, 2009 Boulanger was formally charged in the scandal. Boulanger pleaded guilty to bribing government officials the next day.
Following the initial wave of the Abramoff scandal, Boulanger became a regular on Fox News and MSNBC, and was named by Politico as one of the "50 Politicos To Watch" for his "nattily attired, outside-the-box staying power."
Personal.
Boulanger is married to Jessica Incitto, a Republican spokesperson who has worked for Tom DeLay, Roy Blunt and Progress for America.

Yttrium

Yttrium is a chemical element with symbol Y and atomic number 39. It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a "rare earth element". Yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element. Its only stable isotope, 89Y, is also its only naturally occurring isotope.
In 1787, Carl Axel Arrhenius found a new mineral near Ytterby in Sweden and named it "ytterbite", after the village. Johan Gadolin discovered yttrium's oxide in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and Anders Gustaf Ekeberg named the new oxide "yttria". Elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by Friedrich Wöhler.
The most important use of yttrium is in making phosphors, such as the red ones used in television set cathode ray tube (CRT) displays and in LEDs. It is also used in the production of electrodes, electrolytes, electronic filters, lasers and superconductors; various medical applications; and the tracing of various materials to enhance their properties. Yttrium has no known biological role, and exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans.
Characteristics.
Properties.
Yttrium is a soft, silver-metallic, lustrous and highly crystalline transition metal in group 3. As expected by periodic trends, it is less electronegative than its predecessor in the group, scandium and less electronegative than the next member of period 5, zirconium; additionally, it is of comparable electronegativity to its successor in its group, lutetium, due to the lanthanide contraction. Yttrium is the first d-block element in the fifth period.
The pure element is relatively stable in air in bulk form, due to passivation resulting from the formation of a protective oxide () film on its surface. This film can reach a thickness of 10 µm when yttrium is heated to 750 °C in water vapor. When finely divided, however, yttrium is very unstable in air; shavings or turnings of the metal can ignite in air at temperatures exceeding 400 °C. Yttrium nitride (YN) is formed when the metal is heated to 1000 °C in nitrogen.
Similarity to the lanthanides.
The similarities of yttrium to the lanthanides are so strong that the element has historically been grouped with them as a rare earth element, and is always found in nature together with them in rare earth minerals.
Chemically, yttrium resembles these elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, scandium, and if its physical properties were plotted against atomic number then it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanides gadolinium and erbium.
It often also falls in the same range for reaction order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'Yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves as if it were one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.
One of the few notable differences between the chemistry of yttrium and that of the lanthanides is that yttrium is almost exclusively trivalent, whereas about half of the lanthanides can have valences other than three.
Compounds and reactions.
As a trivalent transition metal, yttrium forms various inorganic compounds, generally in the oxidation state of +3, by giving up all three of its valence electrons. A good example is yttrium(III) oxide (), also known as yttria, a six-coordinate white solid.
Yttrium forms a water-insoluble fluoride, hydroxide, and oxalate, but its bromide, chloride, iodide, nitrate and sulfate are all soluble in water. The Y3+ ion is colorless in solution because of the absence of electrons in the d and f electron shells.
Water readily reacts with yttrium and its compounds to form . Concentrated nitric and hydrofluoric acids do not rapidly attack yttrium, but other strong acids do.
With halogens, yttrium forms trihalides such as yttrium(III) fluoride (), yttrium(III) chloride (), and yttrium(III) bromide () at temperatures above roughly 200 °C. Similarly, carbon, phosphorus, selenium, silicon and sulfur all form binary compounds with yttrium at elevated temperatures.
Organoyttrium chemistry is the study of compounds containing carbon–yttrium bonds. A few of these are known to have yttrium in the oxidation state 0. (The +2 state has been observed in chloride melts, and +1 in oxide clusters in the gas phase.) Some trimerization reactions were observed by using organoyttrium compounds as catalysts. These compounds use as a starting material, which in turn is obtained from and concentrated hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride.
Hapticity is how a group of contiguous atoms of a ligand are coordinated to a central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character "eta", η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands were bound to a d0-metal center through a η7-hapticity. Vaporization of the graphite intercalation compounds graphite–Y or graphite– leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as Y@C82. Electron spin resonance studies indicated the formation of Y3+ and (C82)3− ion pairs. The carbides Y3C, Y2C, and YC2 can each hydrolyze to form hydrocarbons.
Nucleosynthesis and isotopes.
Yttrium in the Solar System was created through stellar nucleosynthesis, mostly by the s-process (≈72%), but also by the r-process (≈28%). The r-process consists of rapid neutron capture of lighter elements during supernova explosions. The s-process is a slow neutron capture of lighter elements inside pulsating red giant stars.
Yttrium isotopes are among the most common products of the nuclear fission of uranium occurring in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In terms of nuclear waste management, the most important isotopes of yttrium are 91Y and 90Y, with half-lives of 58.51 days and 64 hours, respectively. Though 90Y has the short half-life, it exists in secular equilibrium with its long-lived parent isotope, strontium-90 (90Sr) with a half-life of 29 years.
All group 3 elements have an odd atomic number, and therefore they have few stable isotopes. Scandium has one stable isotope, and yttrium itself has only one stable isotope, 89Y, which is also its only naturally occurring one. However, the lanthanide rare earths contain elements of even atomic number and many stable isotopes. Yttrium-89 is thought to be more abundant than it otherwise would be, due in part to the s-process, which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by electron emission (neutron → proton). Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with atomic mass numbers (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable atomic nuclei with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively. 89Y has a mass number close to 90 and has 50 neutrons in its nucleus.
At least 32 synthetic isotopes of yttrium have been observed, and these range in atomic mass number from 76 to 108. The least stable of these is 106Y with a half-life of >150 ns (76Y has a half-life of >200 ns) and the most stable is 88Y with a half-life of 106.626 days. Besides the isotopes 91Y, 87Y, and 90Y, with half-lives of 58.51 days, 79.8 hours, and 64 hours, respectively, all the other isotopes have half-lives of less than a day and most of those have half-lives of less than an hour.
Yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or below 88 decay primarily by positron emission (proton → neutron) to form strontium (Z = 38) isotopes. Yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or above 90 decay primarily by electron emission (neutron → proton) to form zirconium (Z = 40) isotopes. Isotopes with mass numbers at or above 97 are also known to have minor decay paths of β− delayed neutron emission.
Yttrium has at least 20 metastable or excited isomers ranging in mass number from 78 to 102. Multiple excitation states have been observed for 80Y and 97Y. While most of yttrium's isomers are expected to be less stable than their ground state, 78mY, 84mY, 85mY, 96mY, 98m1Y, 100mY, and 102mY have longer half-lives than their ground states, as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than isomeric transition.
History.
In 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a heavy black rock in an old quarry near the Swedish village of Ytterby (now part of the Stockholm Archipelago). Thinking that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten, he named it "ytterbite" and sent samples to various chemists for further analysis.
Johan Gadolin at the University of Åbo identified a new oxide or "earth" in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794. Anders Gustaf Ekeberg confirmed this in 1797 and named the new oxide "yttria". In the decades after Antoine Lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements, it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been "yttrium".
In 1843, Carl Gustaf Mosander found that samples of yttria contained three oxides: white yttrium oxide (yttria), yellow terbium oxide (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored erbium oxide (called 'terbia' at the time). A fourth oxide, ytterbium oxide, was isolated in 1878 by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac. New elements would later be isolated from each of those oxides, and each element was named, in some fashion, after Ytterby, the village near the quarry where they were found (see ytterbium, terbium, and erbium). In the following decades, seven other new metals were discovered in "Gadolin's yttria". Since yttria was a mineral after all and not an oxide, Martin Heinrich Klaproth renamed it gadolinite in honor of Gadolin.
Yttrium metal was first isolated in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler heated anhydrous yttrium(III) chloride with potassium:
Until the early 1920s, the chemical symbol Yt was used for the element, after which Y came into common use.
In 1987, yttrium barium copper oxide was found to achieve high-temperature superconductivity. It was only the second material known to exhibit this property, and it was the first known material to achieve superconductivity above the (economically important) boiling point of nitrogen.
Occurrence.
Abundance.
Yttrium is found in most rare earth minerals, as well as some uranium ores, but is never found in nature as a free element. About 31 ppm of the Earth's crust is yttrium, making it the 28th most abundant element there, and 400 times more common than silver. Yttrium is found in soil in concentrations between 10 and 150 ppm (dry weight average of 23 ppm) and in sea water at 9 ppt. Lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project have a relatively high content of yttrium.
Yttrium has no known biological role, though it is found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans. There is normally as little as 0.5 milligrams found within the entire human body; human breast milk contains 4 ppm. Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20 ppm and 100 ppm (fresh weight), with cabbage having the largest amount. With up to 700 ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.
Production.
The chemical similarity of yttrium with the lanthanides leads it to being enriched by the same processes and ends up in ores containing lanthanides, forming rare earth minerals. A slight separation is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare earth elements (HREE) but this separation is never complete. Yttrium is concentrated in the HREE group by virtue of its ionic size even though it has a lower atomic mass.
There are four main sources for REEs:
One method to obtain pure yttrium from the mixed oxide ores is to dissolve the oxide in sulfuric acid and fractionate it by ion exchange chromatography. With the addition of oxalic acid, the yttrium oxalate precipitates. The oxalate is converted into the oxide by heating under oxygen. By reacting the resulting yttrium oxide with hydrogen fluoride, yttrium fluoride is obtained. Using quaternary ammonium salts as extractants, yttrium prefers to remain in the aqueous phase: when the counter-ion is nitrate, the light lanthanides are removed, but when the counter-ion is thiocyanate, the heavy lanthanides are removed. Yttrium salts of 99.999% purity are obtained. In the usual situation, where yttrium is two-thirds of a heavy-lanthanide mixture, there is an advantage to getting it out of the system as quickly as possible, to ease the separation of the remaining elements.
Annual world production of yttrium oxide had reached 600 tonnes by 2001, with reserves estimated at 9 million tonnes. Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing yttrium fluoride to a metal sponge with calcium magnesium alloy. The temperature of an arc furnace of above 1,600 °C is sufficient to melt the yttrium.
Applications.
Consumer.
Yttria () can serve as host lattice for doping with Eu3+ cations as well as reactant to gain doped yttrium orthovanadate YVO4:Eu3+ or yttrium oxide sulfide :Eu3+ phosphors that give the red color in color television picture tubes, though the red color itself is actually emitted from the europium while the yttrium collects energy from the electron gun and passes it to the phosphor. Yttrium compounds can serve as host lattices for doping with different lanthanide cations. Besides Eu3+ also Tb3+ can be used as a doping agent leading to green luminescence. Yttria is also used as a sintering additive in the production of porous silicon nitride and as a common starting material for both material science and for producing other compounds of yttrium.
Yttrium compounds are used as a catalyst for ethylene polymerization. As a metal, it is used on the electrodes of some high-performance spark plugs. Yttrium is also used in the manufacturing of gas mantles for propane lanterns as a replacement for thorium, which is radioactive.
Developing uses include yttrium-stabilized zirconia in particular as a solid electrolyte and as an oxygen sensor in automobile exhaust systems.
Garnets.
Yttrium is used in the production of a large variety of synthetic garnets, and yttria is used to make yttrium iron garnets ( or YIG), which are very effective microwave filters. Yttrium, iron, aluminium, and gadolinium garnets (e.g. Y3(Fe,Al)5O12 and Y3(Fe,Ga)5O12) have important magnetic properties. YIG is also very efficient as an acoustic energy transmitter and transducer. Yttrium aluminium garnet ( or YAG) has a hardness of 8.5 and is also used as a gemstone in jewelry (simulated diamond). Cerium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Ce) crystals are used as phosphors to make white LEDs.
YAG, yttria, yttrium lithium fluoride (), and yttrium orthovanadate () are used in combination with dopants such as neodymium, erbium, ytterbium in near-infrared lasers. YAG lasers have the ability to operate at high power and are used for drilling into and cutting metal. The single crystals of doped YAG are normally produced by the Czochralski process.
Material enhancer.
Small amounts of yttrium (0.1 to 0.2%) have been used to reduce the grain sizes of chromium, molybdenum, titanium, and zirconium. It is also used to increase the strength of aluminium and magnesium alloys. The addition of yttrium to alloys generally improves workability, adds resistance to high-temperature recrystallization and significantly enhances resistance to high-temperature oxidation (see graphite nodule discussion below).
Yttrium can be used to deoxidize vanadium and other non-ferrous metals. Yttria is used to stabilize the cubic form of zirconia for use in jewelry.
Yttrium has been studied for possible use as a nodulizer in making nodular cast iron, which has increased ductility (the graphite forms compact nodules instead of flakes to form nodular cast iron). Yttrium oxide can also be used in ceramic and glass formulas, since it has a high melting point and imparts shock resistance and low thermal expansion characteristics. It is therefore used in camera lenses.
Medical.
The radioactive isotope yttrium-90 is used in drugs such as Yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide and Yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan for the treatment of various cancers, including lymphoma, leukemia, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, and bone cancers. It works by adhering to monoclonal antibodies, which in turn bind to cancer cells and kill them via intense β-radiation from the yttrium-90 (see Monoclonal antibody therapy).
Needles made of yttrium-90, which can cut more precisely than scalpels, have been used to sever pain-transmitting nerves in the spinal cord, and yttrium-90 is also used to carry out radionuclide synovectomy in the treatment of inflamed joints, especially knees, in sufferers of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
A neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser has been used in an experimental, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in canines in an attempt to reduce collateral nerve and tissue damage, whilst the erbium-doped ones are starting to be used in cosmetic skin resurfacing.
Superconductors.
Yttrium was used in the yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa2Cu3O7, aka 'YBCO' or '1-2-3') superconductor developed at the University of Alabama and the University of Houston in 1987. This superconductor operated at 93 K, notable because this is above liquid nitrogen's boiling point (77.1 K). As the price of liquid nitrogen is lower than that of liquid helium, which must be used for the metallic superconductors, the operating costs would decrease.
The actual superconducting material is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–"d", where "d" must be less than 0.7 for the material to superconduct. The reason for this is still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.
The theory of low temperature superconductivity has been well understood since the BCS theory was put forward in 1957. It is based on a peculiarity of the interaction between two electrons in a crystal lattice. However, the BCS theory does not explain high temperature superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be precisely controlled if superconductivity is to occur.
The created material was a black and green, multi-crystal, multi-phase mineral. Researchers are studying a class of materials known as perovskites that are alternative mixtures of these elements, hoping to eventually develop a practical high-temperature superconductor.
Precautions.
Water soluble compounds of yttrium are considered mildly toxic, while its insoluble compounds are non-toxic. In experiments on animals, yttrium and its compounds caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of yttrium citrate caused pulmonary edema and dyspnea, while inhalation of yttrium chloride caused liver edema, pleural effusions, and pulmonary hyperemia.
Exposure to yttrium compounds in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and upper respiratory tract irritation—though this may have been caused by the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. NIOSH recommends a time-weighted average limit of 1 mg/m3 and an IDLH of 500 mg/m3. Yttrium dust is flammable.

Sveti Ožbolt

Sveti Ožbolt (; ) is a settlement in the Municipality of Škofja Loka in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.
Name.
The name of the settlement was changed from "Sveti Ožbolt" (literally, 'Saint Oswald') to "Ožbolt nad Zmincem" (literally, 'Oswald above Zminec') in 1955. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms. The name "Sveti Ožbolt" was restored in 1997. In the 19th century the German name was "Sankt Oswald".
Church.
The local church, built on a hill above the settlement, is dedicated to Saint Oswald and is Late Gothic with the date 1527 in its vaulted sanctuary. The nave dates to 1644 and originally had a flat ceiling but was vaulted in 1849. Frescos on the arch leading to the sanctuary were painted by Jernej of Loka in 1534.

Christina Romer

Christina D. Romer (née Duckworth; born December 25, 1958) is the Class of 1957 Garff B. Wilson Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and a former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration. She resigned from her role on the Council of Economic Advisers on September 3, 2010.
After her nomination and before the Obama administration took office, Romer worked with economist Jared Bernstein to co-author the administration's plan for recovery from the 2008 recession. In a January 2009 video presentation, she discussed details of the job creation program that the Obama administration submitted to Congress.
Early life.
Romer was born in Alton, Illinois. She graduated from Glen Oak High School in Canton, Ohio, in June 1977. She obtained her bachelor's degree in economics from The College of William & Mary in 1981, and her Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985. Upon completion of her doctorate, she started working as an assistant professor at Princeton University. In 1988 she moved to the University of California, Berkeley and was promoted to full professor in 1993.
Research.
Romer's early work focused on a comparison of macroeconomic volatility before and after World War II. Romer showed that much of what had appeared to be a decrease in volatility was due to better economic data collection, although recessions have become less frequent over time.
She has also researched the causes of the Great Depression in the United States and how the US recovered from the depression. Her work showed that the Great Depression occurred more severely in the US than in Europe, and had somewhat different causes than the Great Depression in Europe. Romer showed that fiscal policy played a relatively small role in the recovery from the depression in the US, because taxes were raised in the US almost as quickly as government spending increased during the New Deal. However, accidental monetary policy played a large role in the US recovery from depression. This monetary policy came first from the devaluation of the dollar in terms of gold in 1933–1934, and later from the flight of European capital to the relatively stable US as war in Europe became more likely.
She has done extensive work on fiscal and monetary policy from the Great Depression to the present, using notes from the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the materials prepared by Fed staff to study how the Federal Reserve makes its decisions. Her work suggests that some of the credit for the relatively stable economic growth in the 1950s should lie with good policy made by the Federal Reserve, and that the members of the FOMC could at times have made better decisions by relying more closely on forecasts made by the Fed professional staff.
Her recent work (with David Romer) has focused on the impact of tax policy on government and general economic growth. This work looks at the historical record of US tax changes from 1945–2007, excluding "endogenous" tax changes made to fight recessions or offset the cost of new government spending. It finds that such "exogenous" tax increases, made for example to reduce inherited budget deficits, reduce economic growth (though by smaller amounts after 1980 than before). Romer and Romer also find "no support for the hypothesis that tax cuts restrain government spending; indeed ... tax cuts may increase spending. The results also indicate that the main effect of tax cuts on the government budget is to induce subsequent legislated tax increases." However, she notes that "Our baseline specification suggests that an exogenous tax increase of one percent of GDP lowers real GDP by roughly three percent." 
Career.
She is a former vice president of the American Economic Association, a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship recipient, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a winner of the Berkeley Distinguished Teaching Award. Professor Romer is co-director of the Program in Monetary Economics at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and was a member of the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee until she resigned from this position on November 25, 2008.
In 2008 Romer was set to join the Harvard faculty of economics, while her husband was offered a position at the university's Kennedy School of Government. However, the Romers remained at Berkeley after Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard's president, vetoed her appointment. Her decision resulted in substantial discussion within the discipline and in the mass media. The motivations for Faust's decision to block Romer's appointment remain unclear, though speculation has focused on an opposition among "New Classical" economists to her "New Keynesian" tendencies, or a reluctance to appoint MIT-trained faculty at Harvard.
In late 2008, Romer along with fellow economic advisors Larry Summers and Peter R. Orszag presented then-President-elect Barack Obama with recommendations for a stimulus package. Romer calculated that a $1.8-trillion package was necessary to fill the output gap, but Summers rejected the proposal and opted not to include it in the memo fearing that a trillion-dollar package would not pass through Congress. The Obama administration ultimately passed an $800-billion package.
Family.
She is married to David Romer, her classmate at MIT and her colleague in the economics department at University of California, Berkeley. They have adjoining offices in the department, and collaborate on much of their research. The couple have three children together. She is not related to Paul Romer, the economist famous for his work on economic growth, although she has a son with the same name.

Peterborough Saxons

The Peterborough Saxons (formerly the East Midland Saxons) are an American Football team competing in Division 2 East of the BAFA National League BAFANL for 2012. Moving to their new home this season, home games will be played at the Lion's Den (Bretton) in Peterborough. The senior team was first formed in 2001 and entered senior competition the following year. 2008 was the most successful year to date, recording their highest number of wins, largest ever win and reaching the playoffs for the second consecutive year.
History.
East Midlands Saxons (01-04).
The East Midlands Saxons were officially formed in late 2001 as a means of allowing players from the local UCLA Renegades youth kitted team to continue playing after they reached the cut-off age for youth football. Playing their home games in Boston, Lincolnshire, they were accepted into the British Senior League for the 2002 season, where they competed in Division Two North. Their largely inexperienced squad was largely drawn from the UCLA Renegades youth team and a former senior team called the Haven Raiders. They also joined together with a number of veteran players from defunct teams previously based in Kings Lynn, Boston and Peterborough. It was a struggle for most of the season and the team failed to win any of their games, losing seven and drawing three.
The Saxons relocated to Spalding Rugby Club in 2003, with the main benefit being that they were now in a more centralised location within their particular catchment area. This meant they were able to attract more local players, and the size of the squad grew. This benefit was apparent on their opening matchday as they recorded their first ever victory at this level, a 31–12 win over the Manchester Titans. After a good start to the season, the Saxons won a further two games. An injury to their American running back saw them lose their last five games, failing to score in three of them and finishing 3–6–1.
The team moved to the Castle Sports Centre in Spalding, where they played their home games for the 2004 season in the reorganised Division Two North. They suffered due to only having 3 coaches and injuries which saw them travel to several games with under 20 fit players. This led to them forfeiting their final match of the season. They lost all nine of their regular season games, only scoring 20 points.
Move to Peterborough (05-07).
2005 saw a number of changes for the club. They were realigned to the British American Football League Division Two East and moved their home games to Stanground College in Peterborough. This move proved beneficial as they were able to recruit more players, doubling their squad size from an average of 20 to over 45. All three of the team's victories came against the Merseyside Nighthawks, whom they had failed to beat in each of their previous meetings. This number of wins was repeated the following season in 2006, with the highlight being their 14–13 victory over the Norwich Devils.
After spending a season in the Eastern conference, the Saxons were once again realigned into the Central conference of Division Two for the 2007 season. After narrowly losing their first two games, they then won seven out of their last eight games and scored a total of 236 points, the fifth best total in the country. In doing so, they finished second in their group, easily qualifying for the post-season playoffs for the first time in their history. The Saxons were given a long journey north to play the Dundee Hurricanes, and lost a close game 8–14.
Peterborough Saxons (08–11).
Prior to the 2008 season, the team's name was changed to the Peterborough Saxons. On the field, they bettered the previous season's record, finishing the regular season with two defeats (both of which came against local rivals Cambridgeshire Cats. The Saxons scored 379 points, second only to the season's divisional champions, the London Cobras. They also recorded their largest-ever victory, an 80–0 win over the MK City Pathfinders. The Saxons' last home game of the season was a local derby against the Bedfordshire Blue Raiders, which was played at nearby RAF Alconbury in front of over 1000 spectators. The Saxons won the inaugural Tri-Base Bowl 35–3 to secure their place in the playoffs for the second year running. Despite earning a home draw for their wild-card playoff match, they were beaten 6–9 by the visiting Cornish Sharks due to a field goal scored with four seconds left. The team was promoted to Division 1 at the end of 2008 as part of a restructure of the league. In some quarters this promotion was controversial and there were some mutterings that the team was a very good Division 2 team, but did not merit promotion. The team was very competitive at this level in 2009 and continued to improve and prove many wrong, posting a .500 record in 2010.
After a difficult offseason with many departures to other clubs, three games into the 2011 season, both the long-term GM and the HC left the team due to personal reason. An interim GM was put in place with the aim to continue the season, but due to safety concerns with dwindling numbers, the team withdrew from competition for the 2011 season.
Peterborough Saxons v2.0.
The events of the 2011 was not to be the end of the Saxons, but a new beginning. With a core group of 15 players, a new GM with passion and determination to turn the club around was appointed. He quickly set up a committee and went on the search for a new Head Coach to lead the team forward. The search proved successful in the form of William White, a man who had tasted glory at the top level of British American Football with the Coventry Jets. Will brought a vision, experience and excitement that the new Team Saxons knew he was the man to lead them forward. The 2011 season ended with a scrimmage with the Bradford Bears University team, showing signs that the club was on its way back for the 2012 season. After promising pre-season results, the Saxons headed into the season ready to return some pride to the team.
After an unbeaten 2012 season and securing the number 1 spot in the South and home advantage throughout the play-offs, they welcomed the Cornish Sharks to Fortress Fengate. A 33–6 victory and a MK Pathfinders victory over the Oxford Saints set up a 3rd encounter between the sides this season. The Pathfinders were keen to get the one victory that counted and make their way to the final. The Saxon's showed the Pathfinders again their superiority and cruised to victory and earned another shut-out. This set up a cracking final of 2 undefeated teams, the Peterborough Saxons and the Sheffield Predators. The Saxons and the Double Wing running Predators went blow for blow for 60 minutes and could not be separated at 33–33. The Saxons went down in OT in a game that had everything.
Divisional realignments were announced by BAFANL on 23 September 2012. These placed the Peterborough Saxons in the Premiership South Conference. This was a big step up for the Saxons going straight from the former Division 2 to the top flight of football in the county. Joining them will be: London Blitz, London Warriors, London Olympians, Bristol Aztecs, Ipswich Cardinals, East Kent Mavericks, Berkshire Renegades, Sussex Thunder, South Wales Warriors and the Cambridgeshire Cats.
2012 season.
Game Notes.
The First regular season game of the 2012 Season saw the Peterborough Saxons travel 40 miles to the Bedfordshire Blue Raiders. After an early mistake on the punt return, the Saxons gifted the Raiders the ball inside the 10-yard line and they punched the ball in for an early score, missing the 2-pt conversion. A scrappy first half dominated by both Defenses saw a battle for field position. Just as it looked like Bedford would take the advantage into the half, D. Williams trucked his way into the endzone on a punt return to level the score at 6–6. The second half started with much of the same with the Saxons determined to establish the run game. Early in the 4th quarter, after driving the length of the field, T.Jones punched that ball in to put the Saxons up 12–6 after the 2-pt conversion failed. The Blue Raiders took to the air and were picked off on a couple of occasions, with one getting returned for a TD by W.Gumbs after some huge blocks, and sealed the game 18–6.

Abell 2142

Abell 2142, or A2142, is a huge, X-ray luminous galaxy cluster in the constellation Corona Borealis. It is the result of a still ongoing merger between two galaxy clusters. The combined cluster is six million light years across, contains hundreds of galaxies and enough gas to make a thousand more. It is "one of the most massive objects in the universe."
X-Ray Image.
The image on the right was taken 20 August 1999 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory's 0.3-10.0 keV Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), and covers an area of 7.5 x 7.2 arc minutes. It shows a colossal cosmic "weather system" produced by the collision of two giant clusters of galaxies. For the first time, the pressure fronts in the system have been traced in detail, and show a bright, but relatively cool 50 million degree Celsius central region (white) embedded in large elongated cloud of 70 million degree Celsius gas (magenta), all of which is roiling in a faint "atmosphere" of 100 million degree Celsius gas (faint magenta and dark blue). The bright source in the upper left is an active galaxy in the cluster.
Quick Facts.
Abell 2142 is part of the Abell catalogue of rich clusters of galaxies originally published by UCLA astronomer George O. Abell (1927-1983) in 1958. It has a heliocentric redshift of 0.0909 (meaning it is moving away from us at 27,250 km/s) and a visual magnitude of 16.0. It is about 1.2 billion light years (380 Mpc) away.
Merger Dynamics.
A2142 has attracted attention because of its potential to shed light on the dynamics of mergers between galaxies. Clusters of galaxies grow through gravitational attraction of smaller groups and clusters. During a merger the kinetic energy of colliding objects heats the gas between subclusters, causing marked variations in gas temperature. These variations contain information on the stage, geometry and velocity of the merger. An accurate temperature map can provide a great deal of information on the nature of the underlying physical processes. Previous instruments (e.g., ROSAT, ASCA) did not have the capabilities of Chandra and XMM-Newton (two current X-ray observatories) and were unable to map the region in detail.
Chandra has been able to measure variations of temperature, density, and pressure with high resolution. "Now we can begin to understand the physics of these mergers, which are among the most energetic events in the universe," said Maxim Markevitch of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass., and leader of the international team involved in the analysis of the observations. "The pressure and density maps of the cluster show a sharp boundary that can only exist in the moving environment of a merger." 
A2142's observed X-ray emissions are largely smooth and symmetric, suggesting it is a result of a merger between two galaxy clusters viewed at least 1–2 billion years after the initial core crossing. One would expect to observe uneven X-ray emission and obvious shock fronts if the merger was at an early stage. Markevitch et al. have proposed that the central galaxy (designated G1) of a more massive cluster has merged with the former central galaxy (G2) of the less massive cluster. The relatively cool central area suggests that the heating caused by previous shock fronts missed the central core, interacting instead with the surrounding gas.

Lincoln Motor Company Plant

The Lincoln Motor Company Plant was an automotive plant located at 6200 West Warren Avenue (at Livernois) in Detroit, Michigan, later known as the Detroit Edison Warren Service Center. The complex was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978, due to its historic association with World War I Liberty engines and the Lincoln Motor Company. However, the main structures were demolished in 2003 and NHL designation was withdrawn in 2005.
Henry Leland's Lincoln.
Beginning in 1902, Henry Leland steered Cadillac to become a popular, high quality luxury automobile brand. Leland sold the company to General Motors in 1908, but continued his association with Cadillac until the mid-1910s, when he resigned because of the company's unwillingness to transition to World War I wartime production needs. In 1917, Leland established the Lincoln Motor Company to build Liberty engines for fighter planes using Ford Motor Company-supplied cylinders. Leland immediately purchased a small factory on the west side of Detroit. However, he quickly realized the facilities were not sufficient to house the engine production envisioned, so he purchased a 50-acre plot of land at Warren and Livernois. The company immediately broke ground for a factory complex of over , hiring architect George Mason to design the new buildings and the firm of Walbridge-Aldinger to build them. By the end of the war, the plant complex contained the Administration Building and Garage (Building A), the machine shop (Building B), the main Factories (Buildings C and D), a power house, a heat treatment plant, a motor testing building, and other minor structures.
In January 1919, after producing 6500 Liberty engines, manufacturing operations were suspended, and the war was soon over. Lincoln considered manufacturing automobile engines for other nameplates in the postwar years, but soon opted to convert to the production of luxury automobiles. However, production delays and the postwar recession of 1920 hurt sales, and the company struggled, eventually going into receivership. 
Henry Ford's Lincoln.
In 1922, Henry Ford purchased the company for $8,000,000, turning the Lincoln into Ford Motor Company's luxury brand. Leland retained his management post after the sale, but the strong-willed Leland and Ford immediately clashed, and Leland resigned after a few months. Ford immediately began refurbishing the plant layout and manufacturing. Ford also added onto the size of the complex, hiring architect Albert Kahn to design some of the many buildings along Livernois, adding over to the plant. The Lincoln Zephyr and Continental were made in the factory until 1952, when production facilities were moved to Wayne, Michigan. 
The Lincoln Plant after automobiles.
Ford kept some offices in the plant, and leased out portions to other companies. In 1955, Detroit Edison bought the complex for $4,500,000, renaming it the Detroit Edison Warren Service Center. The company consolidated many of its services into the facility, but later used it primarily as a storage yard.
In recognition of its importance in automotive history, the Lincoln Motor Company Plant was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 2, 1978. However, nearly all of the plant buildings were demolished in December 2002 and January 2003, including the main Buildings A, B, C, and D. A small portion of the Factory G was retained, as well as other scattered support structures; however, because of the substantial loss of historic integrity the plant's National Historic Landmark designation was withdrawn on April 4, 2005.

Sveti Andrej, Škofja Loka

Sveti Andrej (; ) is a settlement in the Municipality of Škofja Loka in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.
Name.
The name of the settlement was changed from "Sveti Andrej" (literally, 'Saint Andrew') to "Andrej nad Zmincem" (literally, 'Andrew above Zminec') in 1955. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms. The name "Sveti Andrej" was restored in 1997. In the 19th century the German name was "Sankt Andrä".
Church.
The local church, built on a hill above the settlement, is dedicated to Saint Andrew. It is Late Gothic, dating to between 1520 and 1530. The nave was vaulted in 1831. The frescos in the sanctuary, behind the altar, and one on the exterior were painted by Jernej of Loka at the time the church was built and most of the remaining decoration is from the 17th century. The main altar dates to 1773 and the side altars are from the late 17th century.

Great Lakes Quilt Center

The Great Lakes Quilt Center is Michigan State University Museum’s center of quilt-related research, education, and exhibition activities. While the museum, established in 1855, has long held significant collections, its focus of activities on quilt scholarship and education began with the launch of the Michigan Quilt Project at the museum in 1984. The Michigan Quilt Project not only spearheaded the documentation of the state's quiltmaking history, but also stimulated interest in strengthening the museum's quilt collection, upgrading its care, and expanding its use. As of 2008, the Michigan Quilt Project has collected documentation on over 9000 quilts in the state and the collection of quilts numbers over 700 with significant examples from Michigan and the Great Lakes region, examples of quilts from numerous African countries, major ethnographic collections of Native American quilts and Michigan African American quilts, and special collections assembled by Kitty Clark Cole, Harriet Clarke, Merry and Albert Silber, Deborah Harding, and Betty Quarton Hoard. The MSU Museum also houses two important collections developed by pioneering American quilt historians Cuesta Benberry and Mary Schafer. 
In partnership with MATRIX: Center for Humane Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences OnLine and the Alliance for American Quilts, the MSU Museum/Great Lakes Quilt Center has spearheaded the development of two major national projects. The multimedia Quilt Treasures Project develops “web portraits” built from video-taped oral history and supporting archival materials. These web portraits document the lives, work, and influence of leaders of the American quilt revival of the last quarter of the 20th century. The Quilt Index is a national digital repository of quilt and quilt-related collections in distributed physical repositories. The Quilt Index digitally preserves the collections and makes them accessible and searchable for research and teaching. The project was beta-tested with the collections of the MSU Museum and, as of 2008, the repository holds over 18000 quilts from nine collections. By the end of 2010, another twelve collections will be added and plans are underway for the addition of scores more.
Stated goals.
According to the GLQC website, the primary goals of the center are to:

South London Swimming Club

South London Swimming Club is one of the largest swimming clubs in the UK. Based at Tooting Bec Lido, South-West London, the club swim outdoors all year round.
History.
Tooting Bec Lido is one of Britain's oldest lidos: it was built in just four months in the spring of 1906. It did not become a 'lido' until the thirties - when the term became widely used - it was originally known as Tooting Bathing-Lake. 
Within weeks of the pool opening in 1906, a group of swimmers got together and formed the South London Swimming Club. The Club made the pool its headquarters and ever since has played a major role in the life of the Lido.
During the 1990s, the club ran the lido off-season and continues to give practical voluntary help to both the council and its leisure contractor, DC Leisure Management Ltd.
To celebrate both its and Tooting Bec Lido's centenary in 2006, the South London Swimming Club hosted several events including the first UK Cold Water Swimming Championships in January and a 3 day film festival, Dive in Movies, in July.

Roman Catholic Territorial Prelature of Tromsø

The Territorial Prelature of Tromsø () is a Roman Catholic territorial prelature located in the city of Tromsø in Norway. The territory is divided into 7 parishes located in the following sites: Tromsø,
Bodø, Hammerfest, Harstad, Mosjøen, Narvik and Storfjord.
History.
The Reformation in Norway ended organized Catholic practice in 1537. Between 1688 and 1834 northern Norway formally formed part of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of the Nordic Missions, before it passed to the Apostolic Vicariate of Sweden in 1834. In 1855 Norway north of the polar circle became part of the new Apostolic Prefecture of the North Pole. This only lasted until August 17, 1869, when northern Norway rejoined with the rest of Norway in the new Apostolic Prefecture of Norway (upgraded to Apostolic Vicariate of Norway in 1892). 
In 1931 the Apostolic Vicariate of Norway was divided into three Catholic jurisdictions, one for southern Norway (called "Apostolic Vicariate of Oslo", 1931–1953; Diocese of Oslo since) and another for central Norway (called "Missionary District of Central Norway", 1931–1935; "Apostolic Prefecture of Central Norway", 1935–1953; "Apostolic Vicariate of Central Norway", 1953–1979; Prelature of Trondheim since). The third Catholic jurisdiction, the one for Norway north of the polar circle (called "Missionary District of Northern Norway" on 8 April 1931; "Apostolic Prefecture of Northern Norway" since 10 March 1944; "Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Norway" since 18 February 1955), became the Prelature of Tromsø on 28 March 1979.

The Late Late Show owl

"The Late Late Show" owl is a motif that has been used by the world's longest-running chat show, "The Late Late Show" on RTÉ One, since its inception in 1962. The owl symbol (a barn owl) is the only remaining theme from the classic format other than the show's name and the traditional annual ‘toy show’ edition. The first thing Ryan Tubridy said when announcing his plans for his takeover as host in August 2009 was: "I can tell you that the owl is not dead". Tubridy posed for photographs on the set holding a wooden owl.
Such is the nature of the owl theme, that RTÉ have used it in advertising campaigns for upcoming television shows. Halifax, a recent sponsor of the show, created its own giant owl mascot which was used to herald the show's arrival, ending and the in-between commercial breaks. It also ran competitions alluding to the famous owl theme, including one for primary schools, with the aim of building a shelter for the barn owl. A month afterwards, the winners, St. Patrick's Boys National School, were invited onto the show to discuss their design.
The mother of the singer Eva Cassidy was startled by the owl on her appearance on "The Late Late Show" and was heard by the show's researcher Will Hanafin to exclaim loudly: "What's that chicken doing flying there?".

LB&amp;SCR H2 class

The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway H2 class was a class of 4-4-2 steam locomotives for express passenger work. They were designed when D. E. Marsh was officially Locomotive Superintendent, and were built at Brighton Works in 1911 and 1912
Background.
During 1911 D. E. Marsh was on leave of absence due to sickness, and his assistant Lawson Billinton was granted authority to construct a further six 4-4-2 'Atlantic' locomotives similar to the Marsh H1 class but incorporating the Schmidt superheater.
Construction and use.
The new H2 class locomotives built by Brighton railway works and introduced between June 1911 and January 1912. They were an immediate success and shared with the H1 class the London to Brighton express trains including the heavily loaded Pullman services the "Brighton Limited", and the "Southern Belle", which the LB&SCR described as "the most luxurious train in the World". 
As with the non-superheated class they were gradually replaced on the London-Brighton express trains in 1925/6 by the "King Arthur" and "River" classes, but there was still plenty of work for them on other express services, including boat trains connecting with the Newhaven-Dieppe ferry service. At the same time they were all named after geographical features of the south coast.
Following the cessation of the cross-channel ferries after 1940, as a result of the Second World War, the class were left with little work to do and several were put into store or else moved to miscellaneous duties in southern England. The H2 class however returned to the boat trains after the end of the war and continued until the mid-1950s.
Withdrawal.
One member of the class was withdrawn in 1949, but the remainder continued in regular use until 1956. The last survivor was withdrawn in April 1958.
Preservation.
No examples of the H2 class were preserved, but on 29 October 2000 the Bluebell Railway announced its intention to reconstruct a Brighton H2 Atlantic based on SR/BR period "Beachy Head". At the time of writing many surviving locomotive parts had been assembled including an ex-GNR 'Atlantic' boiler, and an ex-LB&SCR B4 class tender chassis.

European Association of Urology

The European Association of Urology (EAU) is a non-profit organisation committed to the representation of urology professionals worldwide. All active urology professionals, including urology nurses, are eligible for membership of the EAU.
The constituent bodies of the EAU include the: 
Decisions made by the EAU General Assembly are implemented by the EAU Offices. The Executive Committee and EAU Offices are assisted by the EAU Central Office, which is based in Arnhem, The Netherlands, and run by the Executive Management. 
The European Academy of Urology is the advisory body to and of the EAU. The Academy consists of members who have previously had official responsibilities within the EAU.
Mission.
The EAU’s mission is to raise the level of urological care in Europe by promoting professionalism and competence among our members.
The EAU maintains close contacts with national urology organisations who represent the interests of urologists at a national level worldwide. These independent national organisations are crucial as they support the EAU and its European activities, for example the Annual EAU Congress and ‘Urology Week’, which is organised annually to raise awareness of urological conditions throughout Europe, within the healthcare professions and the general public.
Urology associations in the Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East regions welcome opportunities for bilateral exchanges with EAU members with regard to training, education and other areas in urology. Ultimately, this exchange will benefit the entire specialty. During the Annual EAU Congress, a specific day has been allocated to 'Urology Beyond Europe' (see www.uroweb.org), the sessions held during this day will reinforce collaboration between the EAU and other urology societies worldwide. 
Other ongoing collaborative projects involving the EAU include the European Multidisciplinary Meeting on Urological Cancers (EMUC), which is organised in association with the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO). EMUC brings together world experts in the field of urological oncology, thus providing the opportunity to increase our knowledge and improve our approach to a wide range of topics, including biology, prevention, diagnosis, therapy and quality of life. 
An additional example of EAU collaboration with another organisation for the benefit of urology is the World Health Organisation (WHO) Consensus Conference on bladder cancer, which was held in April 2008. 
The European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN) aims to contribute to the development of higher standards of urology nursing in Europe. EAUN members receive a series of free publications and benefit from additional privileges, such as the fellowship programme.
Annual congress.
The EAU organises congresses and courses in the field of urology. The Annual EAU Congress is the largest urology meeting in the world; in 2008, over 12,000 delegates visited the congress in Milan, Italy.
Regional meetings.
The Board of the EAU has identified the need for an additional series of EU-ACME (European Urology - Accredited Continuing Medical Education) meetings on a regional, but supranational, basis. These meetings provide platforms from which new clinical or experimental work from the region can be presented to an international audience. To complement the international perspective, speakers from outside the region are invited to give lectures on current topics. Recent Regional EAU Meetings have included the 2nd North-Eastern European Meeting and the 8th Central European Meeting.
Section Office.
The EAU Section Office aims to develop specialist sections covering all sub- and super-specialist fields of urology. The participating sections promote and develop scientific and clinical programmes and organise regular meetings to disseminate information about these super-specialist activities and research.
EU-ACME Committee.
In 2004, the EAU and the European Board of Urology (EBU) – the working group of European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS) Section of Urology – joined forces to establish a new committee: the EU-ACME to promote Continuing Medical Education (CME) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for all European urologists. The EBU, an independent organisation, is responsible for all regulatory matters; the involvement of EAU makes a truly European-wide system possible. 
European urologists can gain CME credit points by participating in accredited activities (e.g. by attending meetings or reading scientific publications and answering questions online). These activities are designed to provide information that is both relevant and essential to medical practice. We expect that national CME systems will become obligatory in Europe in the near future. 
All EAU events and annual meetings of the national urology societies are automatically accredited.
European Urological Scholarship Programme (EUSP).
Knowledge shared is knowledge multiplied. The highest standards of urological care can be proliferated by sharing knowledge. The EUSP stimulates clinical and scientific research across Europe and encourages exchange of expertise and knowledge between European urologists. 
The EUSP offers the following programmes:
• scholarship: maximum of 1 year of basic, clinical or experimental research
• clinical fellowship: 6 weeks to 3 months
• short-term visit: maximum of 3 weeks
• visiting professorship : 4 days.
Research Foundation.
To improve and sustain the highest quality of urological research in Europe, the EAU has recently set up the EAU Research Foundation (EAU-RF), an independent body governed by the EAU. The remit of the EAU-RF is to stimulate and coordinate basic, translational and clinical research by qualified ICH GCP investigators. 
The EAU-RF will:
- instigate the formation of networks by establishing a scientific communication infrastructure between the EAU-RF and high-profile clinical study centres, their satellites and basic science laboratories
- initiate and organise multicentre and multinational clinical studies and basic science projects
- initiate, fund and conduct investigator-initiated trials
- identify and offer opportunities for research scholarships
- communicate these activities to European urologists and to public and private sources of funding. 
The EAU-RF has created a governance structure designed to achieve its targets most efficiently. The PR and Fundraising Committee, the Clinical Research Committee, the Basic Research Committee and the Scholarship Committee have been set up, and are complemented by the comprehensive trial support offered at every stage by the EAU Central Research Office - CuraTrial (http://www.curatrial.com).
History Office.
The EAU History Office keeps records of old techniques, instruments, major events and significant figures in European urology, to promote interest in the history of urology. The series ‘Historia Urologiae Europaeae’, (which forms part of the European Classical Library) contains accounts of European urological history. The ‘European Classical Library in Urology’ and ‘The Art Collection’ including ‘From Ornamentation to Mutilation’, are very popular and can be ordered from the EAU web site.
Publications.
The EAU produces several publications that help to disseminate the latest news from the Association.
European Urology, the official scientific journal of the EAU, is a world-class publication involving dedicated urologists and with a high impact factor (IF 8.493). The journal publishes peer-reviewed original articles and topical reviews on a wide range of urological issues. European Urology constantly reviews and updates its features and layout to remain innovative, keep pace with the rapidly evolving world of medicine, technology and surgery and provide the best clinical guidance, research and education for urologists worldwide. European Urology is EU-ACME accredited. It is available in print and online and reaches over 20,000 readers. 
European Urology Today (EUT), the official newsletter of the EAU, reports news from the association and its committees as well as announcements regarding upcoming meetings and congress reports. All members are encouraged to contribute articles to the EUT discussing recent studies, technical developments, fellowship experiences, and other issues of interest to EAU members. EUT is published six times a year in full-colour, newspaper format and is distributed to approximately 13,000 addresses worldwide.
European Urology Video Journal (EUVJ) is produced by the EAU Video Committee on a quarterly basis. Each issue includes a DVD containing 45 minutes of high-quality footage showing surgical techniques. An accompanying brochure contains the author's commentary and step-by-step description of the surgery shown in the video, thus providing the latest information on urological diseases and surgical techniques. All material is educational - common surgical techniques are shown in detail - and informative – the most recent developments regarding new technologies, devices or surgical approaches are presented.
Web site.
The EAU has its own web site. Details of the Annual EAU Congress, including information about the venue, scientific programme and social events, are available on http://www.uroweb.org. 
In addition, the scientific programmes of all the main urology meetings, the EAU guidelines, original EAU articles (including a ‘chat’ function), a virtual school, webinars and online discussions are on the EAU website.
EAU Education Office and the European School of Urology (ESU)
The ESU is part of the Education Office of the EAU. Its aim is to provide every practicing urologist and urologist-in-training in Europe with a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of all contemporary issues and most recent progress within urology.
Each year, post-graduate ESU training courses, covering both general and advanced clinical and research topics, are scheduled during the Annual EAU Congress. In addition, hands-on training courses are offered in collaboration with the European Society of Urological Technology (ESUT), one of the EAU offices. 
The ESU also organises and funds ESU Organised Courses. Course programmes are customised to meet the needs of local organisers and can vary in duration from 2 hours to up to 2 days. The ESU has started to arrange courses at all major national congresses. 
Another initiative from the ESU involves standalone events covering recent developments, for example the annual European Urology Forum in Switzerland. 
Masterclasses discussing the newest topics and latest developments in all fields of urology are held regularly. Recent masterclasses have included ‘medical treatment for urological cancer’ and ‘female and functional urology’.
The ESU has also started to build the Virtual European School of Urology. Using this new educational tool, both residents and urologists will be able to access on-line CME accredited training. All ESU activities are EU-ACME accredited.
Residents.
The ESU organises the European Residents Education Programme (EUREP) course, an educational activity designed for European senior urology residents, in collaboration with the EBU. The course offers a series of teaching modules, after which an EBU examination can be taken. The EAU supports residents in terms of registration, travel and accommodation.
"Political commitment" 
The European Commission strives to improve public health in the European Union, to prevent human illness and diseases, and to obviate sources of danger to human health. 
To achieve a high level of health protection, close cooperation with the scientific experts is vital.
The WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system. The WHO is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, and the EAU therefore strives to be a partner with regard to urological health issues, such as prostate and bladder cancer.

<doc id="20374163" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20374163" title="Wild Geese II">
Wild Geese II

Wild Geese II is a 1985 British action-thriller film directed by Peter R. Hunt, based on the 1982 novel "The Square Circle" by Daniel Carney, in which a group of mercenaries are hired to spring Rudolf Hess from Spandau Prison in Berlin. The film is a sequel to the 1978 film "The Wild Geese", which was also produced by Euan Lloyd and adapted from a novel by Carney. Actor Richard Burton, who starred in the first film as Colonel Allen Faulkner, was planning to reprise his role for the sequel, but he died days before filming began. The sequel has Faulkner's brother (played by Edward Fox) as one of the mercenaries. No characters from the original are featured in the sequel.
Prologue.
Africa 1977
Veteran Mercenary Allen Faulkner trains and then leads a group of fifty hired soldiers in an attempt to rescue deposed President Julius Limbani. After initially being successful the mission begins to fall apart, double-crossed and caught in the open, an enemy plane strafes Faulkner's men. With what few men remain Faulkner looks to escape the country in an old Dakota aeroplane. With only his best friend Rafer Janders is left to board the plane, Janders is shot in the leg and can't catch the taxiing plane. As the hordes of ferocious Simbas are virtually upon him, Janders calls for Faulkner to kill him, which he regretfully does.
Plot.
London 1982
As the only surviving Nazi leader in captivity, Rudolf Hess (Laurence Olivier) has secrets that could destroy the careers of prominent political figures, secrets an international news network will pay any price to get. 
As Alex Faulkner (Edward Fox) arrives for a meeting, Robert McCann (Robert Webber) is arguing with Michael Lukas about the delay of a planned rescue of Rudolf Hess. 
Faulkner is escorted into the office where he meets Michael and Kathy Lukas (John Terry and Barbara Carrera) where they show him a brief video tape and offer to let him name his price to rescue Hess. At first Faulkner thinks they are joking, but when he finds out they are serious, he tells them about the possible consequences of Hess's rescue. Faulkner refuses the offer but recommends John Haddad (Scott Glenn) to them as a substitute. As former Lebanese American soldier turned mercenary Haddad avoids Palestinian hitmen in London. Later network executives Kathy and Michael Lukas hire Haddad to free Hess and get him safely out of West Berlin.
When Haddad arrives in West Berlin he stakes out the outside of Spandau Prison as a jogger while being spied on. He drafts plans of the outside of the prison including guard towers and entrances. The next day Haddad joins a construction team and sneaks away to get into the prison guard entrance. Carefully eluding the guards by studying their timed patrols he drafts floor plans of the hallways and cell blocks.
When he leaves the prison with the construction crew, Haddad is abducted by East German spy Karl Stroebling. Stroebling and his thugs smother Haddad with a plastic bag over his head to torture him into disclosing details about his mission. Haddad escapes and survives by overpowering the thugs and rolls across the street being barely missed run over from an oncoming truck as the police arrive as witnesses to the incident.
While recovering in hospital, Haddad is visited by British Colonel Reed-Henry (Kenneth Haigh). Reed-Henry questions Haddad but to no avail; he leaves Haddad but suspects he is there to rescue Hess. Haddad leaves the hospital and along with Kathy goes to Bavaria to plan the mission without interference from Stroebling. 
Haddad enlists his old mercenary comrade Colonel Alex Faulkner to watch his back. Faulkner, a former British Army officer, is working as an assassin and is an expert marksman. As romance between Haddad and Kathy blossoms, the trio return to West Berlin to find that Reed-Henry will help Haddad release Hess. Once again Stroebling's thug's attempt to kill Haddad, but this time Faulkner helps him kill all but one of them.
Meeting with Reed-Henry to discuss his plan, Haddad agrees to hand over Hess to the Colonel in exchange for help from Regimental Sergeant Major James Murphy (Paul Antrim). Murphy, an ex-warden at Spandau prison, informs Haddad of the prison routine and helps make the mercenaries look like British Royal Military Police. Stroebling offers to remove a contract on Haddad's life in exchange for Hess and the death of Faulkner. Haddad refuses and Stroebling leaves, frustrated.
As the plan is finalised with the News network, Reed-Henry and Stroebling each believing they will receive Hess. Part of the plan involves a staged traffic accident so Haddad employs a fair ground wheel of death rider, Pierre (Malcolm Jamieson) to perform the deliberate crash. Attempting to (subjugate) Haddad into a vulnerable position using blackmail, Stroebling kidnaps Kathy. In exchange for guaranteeing her safety, Haddad must have a member of Stroebling's gang Patrick Hourigan (Derek Thompson) join the rescue group. Haddad and Faulkner are now joined by Kathy's brother and Lebanese mercenaries Joseph and Jamil. The group now including Hourigan are trained by Murphy. During one of Faulkner's fever spells, Hourigan substitutes Faulkner's medication with LSD tablets causing hallucinations. Hourigan taunts Murphy about an IRA ambush he participated in. Murphy shoots Hourigan dead, putting Haddad in a dilemma over Kathy's existing safety. Haddad enlists his final team members, Arab businessman Mustapha El Ali (Stratford Johns) and his employees, to do a couple of minor parts of the rescue. To appease Stroebling, Haddad offers Michael as extra insurance.
Launching a coup that will change the shape of the world, Haddad must also rescue Michael and Kathy from the clutches of Stroebling. Michael creates a diversion for him and Kathy to escape but he is killed during the struggle when the guard retrieves his handgun and shoots him. Moments later Haddad kills the guards and rescues Kathy. The plan goes ahead as scheduled but Pierre is killed in the flaming wreck from the staged accident. Hess is sedated with an anasthetic, and switched with the look-alike corpse from the other ambulance and placed into a waiting jeep. At the rendezvous point at the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial Reed-Henry tries to intercept Hess, but discovers that he has been duped into killing Stroebling disguised as a guard. Kathy, Haddad and Faulkner take a drugged Hess to and from a soccer game with international passengers to their plane flight, and escape from being caught by murdering a customs officer. Reed-Henry confesses to his superiors that Hess has escaped with his rescuers and is nowhere to be found. He accepts execution via being shot with his own pistol from his superiors as his punishment.
Epilogue.
Haddad, and Kathy and Faulkner take Hess to a hotel in Vienna, Austria where he awakens to find himself in an unfamiliar environment. Although he is offered the best hospitality, he insists on knowing why he was drugged while Kathy talks to McCann about the rescue and Michael's death. Hess, knowing that he is being exploited, overhears the conversation and tells Kathy, Haddad and Faulkner that he has no desire to be a part of modern society. Haddad and Faulkner try to talk him into accepting his freedom, but he insists on going back to Spandau to live the rest of his life. The following day Haddad, Kathy and Faulkner take Hess to the French embassy where he turns himself in. An article of a newspaper in the following days tells a story about a false rumour of Hess's escape.
Production.
The film opens with a dedication to the previous film's lead actor Richard Burton, followed by a brief summary of that film. Roger Moore declined to reprise his role from "The Wild Geese", feeling it wasn't right for him.Lewis Collins claimed he was originally signed to play Haddad due to a contract with producer Euan Lloyd but the role went to the American Scott Glenn.
The 77 year-old Laurence Olivier, who portrayed Rudolf Hess, was in poor health during filming requiring a nurse to accompany him during production. He was also beginning to suffer with memory problems and (as co-star Edward Fox recalled) laboured for hours on his one long speech, despite having trouble with the dialogue. Hess’s son Wolf Rudiger Hess said afterwards that Olivier’s likeness of his father was ‘uncannily accurate’. 
Despite his health troubles Ingrid Pitt who starred in the film but didn’t have any scenes with him, did have dinner with Olivier during the production and described him as ‘very old and frail by this time but very gallant.’

Patriarch Evtimiy Boulevard

Patriarch Evtimiy Boulevard () is a central boulevard in the capital of Bulgaria, Sofia. It is named after the 14th century Bulgarian Patriarch Saint Evtimiy of Tarnovo. 
It lies between its crossing with the Vasil Levski Boulevard and Graf Ignatiev Street at the Patriarch Evtimiy Square and the boulevards Praga, Hristo Botev and Skobelev at the "Pette kyosheta" juncture. Among the most important streets it crosses are the Georgi Rakovski Street, Frityov Nansen Street and Vitosha Boulevard.
Its architecture is typical for Sofia during the 1930s and 1940s - mostly six-storey residential edifices with solid facades and relatively high and spacious flats.
History.
The boulevard was reconstructed in the 1970s during the construction of the National Palace of Culture and its park. Until the reconstruction the western part had classical appearance with large trees and a green strip in the middle. The boulevard used to be two-way street until the mid 90s when it became one-way from the Graf Ignatiev Str to the Praga Blvd. The most characteristic transport since the 1930s is the trolley bus №1 but there are also many other lines.

Anicius Probus

Anicius Probus ("fl". 459) was a Roman politician.
A Christian, he is attested in an inscription dated to 30 August 459, found in Aquileia, but now lost; it was the inscription on the tomb of Anicia Ulfina (emended in Iuliana by recent scholars) erected by her parents Anicius Probus and Adeleta (emended in Adelfia by recent scholars, and the daughter of Valerius Adelphius Bassus).
This Anicius Probus has been identified as a member of the "gens" Anicia; he should be the son of the consul Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius and wife and cousin Anicia Iuliana. It is also possible that he was the Probus who, in 424, was a praetor.
In the inscription, Probus is styled as "vir inlustris", but his office is not given; however, since he belonged to a noble and prestigious family, he could have been a praetorian prefect or a "praefectus urbi".

Simone Molinaro

Simone Molinaro (c. 1565 – 1615) was a composer of the late Renaissance in Italy. He was especially renowned for his lute music.
Life and career.
Molinaro was born in Genoa. He studied music with his uncle, Giovanni Battista dalla Gostena, who was maestro di capella at Genoa Cathedral. In 1593, Gostena was murdered, and Molinaro succeeded him in his post at the Cathedral in 1599. The same year he published "Intavolatura di liuto", containing lute works both by himself and by Gostena. In addition to his lute works, Molinaro composed a large amount of sacred choral music, most of which does not survive completely because of missing partbooks. However, some five-voice motets have been preserved in the collections of Hasler and Schadaeus.
Molinaro also served as editor of the works of Carlo Gesualdo, publishing editions of that composer's madrigals in 1585 and 1613.
Assessment.
In his dances for lute, according to Eitner, Molinaro "despises all counterpoint, and shows himself аs a pure melodist and harmonist, but both in so simple and pretty a way, that they all have something uncommonly attractive". Molinaro wrote at the time when, according to Paul Henry Lang, lute music was reaching its apogee. Along with Giovanni Terzi, Molinaro's lute music introduces "a finished, graceful, and sovereign instrumental style, capable of all shades of expression and of a technique which we usually associate only with the vocal music of the period".
The 1613 publication of the Gesualdo madrigals was ground-breaking because it presented Gesualdo's music in full score as opposed to partbook format.
Molinaro's music was used as the basis for "Balletto detto il Conte Orlando" of the "Ancient Airs and Dances Suite No. 1" by Ottorino Respighi.

Olive Stone

Olive "Polly" Matthews Stone (13 January 1897 – 8 November 1977) was a sociologist whose interests focused on human welfare, race relations, and southern American farmers. Stone was born in Dadeville, Alabama, and attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery, Alabama. She taught at various schools before earning her Ph.D. in sociology from UNC-Chapel Hill in 1939, including Alabama College, Huntingdon College, Brookings Institution, UNC-Chapel Hill, College of William and Mary, and Richmond School of Social Work. She later worked as a professor of sociology at Georgia State College for Women, and as an associate professor at the School of Social Welfare, University of California at Los Angeles. Stone also traveled throughout India, China, and Japan for the Fellowship of Reconciliation during 1931-1932 to observe group relations and tensions.
Stone's involvement in radical politics and civil rights, especially in the 1930s, brought her to several race relations conferences, including the Swarthmore Institute of Race Relations in 1934; the Negro-White Conference at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1934; and the Southern Conference for Human Welfare in Birmingham, Alabama, 1938. She also helped establish the Southern Committee for People's Rights, was involved with the Southern Negro Youth Congress, advocated for the rights of farmers and sharecroppers, and worked with a Montgomery hospitality group for those involved in sharecroppers' union, peace, and civil rights work.

Pierre-Octave Ferroud (6 January 1900 – 17 August 1936) was a French composer of classical music.
He was born in Chasselay, Rhône, near Lyon. He went to Lyon, to Strasbourg (for military service from 1920-2) where he studied with Guy Ropartz, and again to Lyon where he was for a time an associate and "disciple" of Florent Schmitt, and a pupil of Georges Martin Witkowski. He then travelled to Paris in 1923, where he later founded with Henry Barraud, Jean Rivier and Emmanuel Bondeville the chamber ensemble "Triton" in 1932.
In a letter to Boris Asafiev, Sergei Prokofiev described his encounter with Ferroud, praised the Symphony in A and suggested that Asafiev might have a look at it. Ferroud's opera, he reported, impressed him much less.
He wrote a biographical work about his mentor Florent Schmitt (who he was, nevertheless, to pre-decease - Schmitt died 31 years after "Autour de Florent Schmitt" was published, in 1958.)
Ferroud was a regular contributor of musical reviews and essays to the journal "Paris-Soir".
He died in 1936, when he was decapitated in a road accident in Debrecen, in Hungary. On hearing of Ferroud's death, Francis Poulenc wrote to Georges Auric of his distress.

Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo () is an exempt diocese located in the city of Oslo in Norway.
Parishes.
The territory is divided into 25 parishes, located in the following sites: Oslo (3), Moss, Askim, Fredrikstad, Halden, Lillestrøm, Hamar, Kongsvinger, Lillehammer, Jessheim, Hønefoss, Stabekk, Drammen, Fagernes, Tønsberg, Larvik, Sandefjord, Porsgrunn, Arendal, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Haugesund and Bergen.
History.
By 1070? the see was established as the Diocese of Oslo, and the bishop was seated at St. Hallvard's Cathedral. In 1537 - in the course of the Lutheran Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein - Christian III of Denmark suppressed the Catholic episcopates at the Norwegian sees. Thereafter Lutheranism prevailed in Scandinavia.
In 1582 the stray Catholics in Norway and elsewhere in Northern Europe were placed under the jurisdiction of a papal nuncio in Cologne. The Congregation de propaganda fide, on its establishment in 1622, took charge of the vast missionary field, which - at its third session - it divided among the nuncio of Brussels (for the Catholics in Denmark and Norway), the nuncio at Cologne (much of Northern Germany) and the nuncio to Poland (Finland, Mecklenburg, and Sweden).
In 1688 Norway became part of the Apostolic Vicariate of the Nordic Missions. The Paderborn bishops functioned as administrators of the apostolic vicariate. In 1834 the Catholic missions in Norway became part of the Apostolic Vicariate of Sweden, seated in the Swedish capital Stockholm. Whereas Norway north of the polar circle became the Apostolic Prefecture of the North Pole in 1855, the rest of Norway stayed with the Swedish vicariate. When a new Catholic missionary jurisdiction was established, it was not at any of the ancient episcopal sees but a mission “sui iuris” on 7 August 1868, created out of parts of North Pole prefecture and the Norwegian part of the Swedish vicariate. On 17 August 1869 the mission became the apostolic prefecture of Norway. On 11 March 1892 the Apostolic Prefecture of Norway was promoted to Apostolic Vicariate of Norway, with an altered name as the "Apostolic Vicariate of Norway and Spitsbergen" between 1 June 1913 and 15 December 1925.
On 10 April 1931 the apostolic vicariate was divided into the Apostolic Vicariate of Oslo (extant 1931–1953; comprising southern Norway), a Catholic jurisdiction for central Norway (called "Missionary District of Central Norway", 1931–1935; "Apostolic Prefecture of Central Norway", 1935–1953; "Apostolic Vicariate of Central Norway", 1953–1979; Prelature of Trondheim since), and a jurisdiction for Norway north of the polar circle (called "Missionary District of Northern Norway", 1931–1944; "Apostolic Prefecture of Northern Norway", 1944–1955; "Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Norway", 1955–1979; Prelature of Tromsø since). On 29 June 1953 the Apostolic Vicariate of Oslo became a separate Roman Catholic diocese, when the same status was given in Sweden to the Stockholm diocese.
Leadership.
Unusually for a Scandinavian diocese, a majority of Oslo's bishops have actually been of the local ethnicity (in this case, Norwegian).

Ceremonial first puck

The ceremonial first puck is a longstanding ritual of ice hockey in which a guest of honor drops a puck to mark the end of pregame festivities and the start of the game. Like baseball's ceremonial first pitch, this first puck does not actually begin play but is retrieved and presented to the guest of honor as a keepsake. In the National Hockey League (NHL), the anthem is routinely played after the ceremonial first puck.
The ceremonial puck dropper may be a notable person (dignitary, celebrity, former player, etc.) who is in attendance, an executive from a company that sponsors the team (especially when that company has sponsored that night's promotional giveaway), or a person who has been awarded the privilege as a result of some recent contest or current event. Especially in the minor leagues, multiple first puck drops are not uncommon; the honoree may merely pose at centre ice displaying his commemorative puck without actually dropping it into any faceoff.
Related terms.
The ceremonial first puck is also referred to as the "ceremonial puck drop". Both terms emphasize that the attention is typically on the honoree who actually drops the puck rather than on the vying for it. Significantly, the ceremony involves the two opposing captains (even a goaltender) who "face off" nonconfrontationally since tradition dictates that the home player always "wins" and presents the puck to the guest of honor.
The official website of the National Hockey League uses the term "ceremonial first puck" about twice as frequently as the somewhat synonymous term "ceremonial faceoff".
Noteworthy first pucks.
On October 6, 2002, in front of a crowd of 18,000 at General Motors Place, Queen Elizabeth II dropped the ceremonial first puck for the National Hockey League exhibition game between the Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks; this was the first time any reigning monarch, Canadian or otherwise, had performed the task.
The 2007 NHL All-Star game first puck was dropped by Texas Governor Rick Perry and Dallas Stars center Mike Modano on January 24, 2007.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger dropped the ceremonial first puck on May 27, 2007, when the Anaheim Ducks hosted the Ottawa Senators.
Brian Leetch dropped the first puck on October 4, 2007, at a New York Rangers game.
Capitalizing on her well-publicized advocacy of ice hockey and her self-identification as a "hockey mom", 2008 Republican Party Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin was invited to perform the ceremonial first puck drop at NHL games during the campaign, including the Philadelphia Flyers hosting of the New York Rangers on October 11 and the St. Louis Blues hosting of the Los Angeles Kings on October 24.
As a native New Yorker and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell dropped the ceremonial first puck at a New York Islanders game at Nassau Coliseum on November 11, 2008, in recognition of Military Appreciation Day and Veterans Day. Powell, the first black U.S. Secretary of State and first black U.S. National Security Adviser, had earlier dropped an Islander puck on January 21, 2008, in honor of Martin Luther King Day.
Literal "first" puck.
Although hockey has been played on ice since at least 1825, the game then more closely resembled field hockey rather than modern ice hockey. By the 1870s, the advantages of a stubby cylinder on a surface of flat ice led to the use of what the "Montreal Gazette" of March 4, 1875 called "a flat, circular piece of wood" which "slid about between the players with great velocity". The same publication finally referred to the hockey object as a "puck" on February 7, 1876.

Dave Christensen

David John Christensen (born January 17, 1961) is an American college football coach and former player. He is currently offensive coordinator for the Utah Utes. Prior to joining Utah, he was head coach at the University of Wyoming from 2009 to 2013, where he compiled a record of 27 wins and 35 losses. Christensen previously served as offensive coordinator for the University of Missouri and University of Toledo. 
Early life.
A native of Everett, Washington, Christensen attended the University of Washington, where he played on the Huskies football team from 1980 to 1982. He earned a B.A. degree in sociology from Western Washington University in 1985 and a M.S. degree in sports science from Eastern Washington University in 1988.
Coaching career.
Christensen was formerly the assistant head coach and offensive coordinator for the University of Missouri. He served as an offensive assistant under Gary Pinkel for 19 years, including the last 16 as his offensive coordinator. He first joined Pinkel at the University of Toledo in 1990 as offensive line coach, and was promoted to offensive coordinator in 1992. Pinkel left for Missouri in 2001, and brought Christensen along as his offensive coordinator. From 2005–2008, Christensen employed a passing-oriented version of the no-huddle spread offense. That offensive scheme has come into vogue recently as several BCS programs have achieved new-found success with it, including Missouri, Houston, and Texas Tech.
In the 2007 season, Christensen's offense used this scheme to good effect by scoring a school record 558 points. Additionally, Missouri ranked fifth in total offensive yards (490.29 per game), eighth in scoring offense (39.86 points per game), and ninth in passing yards (314.07 per game). The same season propelled Chase Daniel to Heisman finalist status. Martin Rucker and Jeremy Maclin were named consensus All-Americans, making it the first time two Tigers were named as such in the same season. Christensen himself was a finalist for the Broyles Award and Rivals.com named him as the Offensive Coordinator of the Year.
Christensen's name had been mentioned with respect to the head coaching position of several ailing programs, namely, New Mexico, Washington, Washington State, and Wyoming. He ultimately accepted the head coaching job at Wyoming. Christensen led the Cowboys to a 2009 New Mexico Bowl win in 2009 against the Fresno State.
On October 13, 2012; Christensen confronted Air Force coach Troy Calhoun after the Cowboys' narrow 28-27 loss to the Falcons. Believing Calhoun had told Air Force quarterback Connor Dietz to fake an injury in order to buy more time before the game-winning touchdown, Christensen launched a profanity-laced tirade at Calhoun, calling him a "fly boy." Christensen apologized the next night and was reprimanded by the Mountain West Conference for his actions. On October 22, Wyoming athletic director Tom Burman suspended Christensen for the Cowboys' game against Boise State and fined him $50,000. Assistant head coach Pete Kaligis coached the team in that game.

Royal Standards of England

The Royal Standards of England were narrow, tapering swallow-tailed heraldic flags, of considerable length, used mainly for mustering troops in battle, in pageants and at funerals, by the monarchs of England. In high favour during the Tudor period, the Royal English Standard was a flag that was of a separate design and purpose to the Royal Banner of England. It featured St George's Cross at its head, followed by a number of heraldic devices, a supporter, badges or crests, with a motto—but it did not bear a coat of arms. The Royal Standard changed its composition frequently from reign to reign, but retained the motto "Dieu et mon droit", meaning God and my right; which was divided into two bands: "Dieu et mon" and "Droyt".
Pennons, banners, standards.
There were three main types of heraldic flag.

The medieval standard was usually about eight feet long, but Tudor heralds determined different lengths, according to the rank of the nobility. "The Great Standard to be sette before the Kinges pavilion or tent – not to be borne in battle" – was 33 foot long. A Duke's standard was 21 foot in length, and that of the humble knight, 12 foot long. These Standards, or personal flags, were displayed by armigerous commanders in battle, but mustering and rallying functions were performed by livery flags; notably the standard which bore the liveries and badges familiar to the retainers and soldiers, of which their uniforms were composed. The St. George in the hoist of each standard was the communal symbol of national identity. This badge or banner of England, at the head of the standard, was the indication that the men assembled beneath it were first, Englishmen, and secondly, the followers of the man whose arms were continued on the Standard.
Badges.
Badges may possibly have preceded crests. The Norman kings and their sons may have originally used lions as badges of kingship. The lion was a Royal Badge long before heraldic records, as Henry I gave a shield of golden lions to his son-in-law Geoffrey of Anjou in 1127. 
The seals of William II and Henry I included many devices regarded as badges. Stephen I used a "sagittary" (centaur) as a badge. Badges were widely used and borne by the first five Plantagenets, notably the "planta genista" (broom plant) from which their name derived; a star and crescent interpreted by some as a sun and moon; the "genet" of Henry II; the rose and thistle of Anne; the white hart of Richard II; the Tudor rose and portcullis. The Stuarts were the last to bear personal badges, ceasing with Anne; the royal badges afterward became more akin to national emblems, evolving into our modern versions.
All sorts of devices were used on standards, usually badges, and sometimes the crest, but invariably the largest and most dominant object on a standard was one of the supporters. The whole banner was usually fringed with the livery colours, giving the effect of the "bordure compony". Except in funerals, these standards were not used after the Tudor period, probably because of the creation of a standing army in the reign of Henry VIII.
Supporters.
Supporters are figures of living creatures each side of an armorial shield, appearing to support it. The origin of supporters can be traced to their usages in tournaments, on Standards, and where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection. Medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons. The Royal Supporters of the monarchs of England are a menagerie of real and imaginary beasts, including the lion, leopard, panther, and tiger, the antelope, greyhound, a cock and bull, eagle, red and gold dragons, and since 1603 the current unicorn.
Standard-badges as Royal supporters. (1377–1558)
Livery colours.
The term livery is derived from the French "livrée" from the Latin "liberare", meaning to liberate or bestow, originally implying the dispensing of food, provisions and clothing &c to retainers. In the Middle Ages the term was then applied to the uniforms and other devices, worn by those who accepted the privileges and obligations of "embracery", or livery and maintenance. The royal liveries of the later Plantagenets were white and red; those of the House of Lancaster were white and blue, the colours of the House of York were murrey (dark red) and blue. The liveries of the House of Tudor were white and green; those of the House of Stuart – and of George I – were yellow and red. In all subsequent reigns, they have been scarlet and blue.
Motto.
Dieu et mon droit (originally "Dieu et mon droyt"; French: 'God and my right'), as seen on Royal standards since King Edward III, is said to have first been adopted as the royal motto by King Henry V in the 15th century, and consistently so used by most later English (and British) kings, with few exceptions. It appears on a scroll beneath the shield of the Coat of arms of the United Kingdom.

Felix Khuner

Felix Khuner (1906–1991) was the second violinist of the Kolisch Quartet. He joined the quartet, then the Wien Quartet, in 1927 when the quartet needed a new second violinist. Khuner was reluctant, but when he visited Rudolf Kolisch, he was in conversation with Arnold Schoenberg. "Does the quartet rehearse with Schoenberg?" Khuner asked. When Kolisch answered yes, Khuner agreed to join the quartet.
Upon the quartet's visit to Berkeley, California in the mid-1930s, Khuner chose Berkeley as the ideal place to live. He liked the cool Mediterranean climate. He met his future wife, Gertrude, in New York, and they wed in California in 1942.
Months before he was too old for the draft, Khuner was drafted into the US Army. He served first as a musician, and was later sent to New Guinea.
After leaving the Army, he continued playing in the first violin section of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, and in the San Francisco Opera and in the orchestra of the San Francisco Ballet. After he retired from the San Francisco Symphony, Khuner did one more stint, joining them for their 1972 tour of Russia. He retired from the San Francisco Opera, which did not have a mandatory retirement age, a few years later.
In the 1970s, Khuner was an instructor in the music department of the University of California, teaching chamber music. He was also concert master of the Monterey Symphony in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Khuner always had private violin students, giving lessons in his home in the Berkeley hills.
He also performed regularly with the San Francisco Chamber Orchestra conducted by Edgar Braun.
He gave his last violin lesson just a few days before he died of lung cancer in June, 1991. He was survived by his wife of 49 years, Gertrude Khuner, four children, and four grandchildren.

Desirée Rogers

Desirée Glapion Rogers (born June 16, 1959, in New Orleans, Louisiana) is an American business executive who is the Chief Executive Officer of Johnson Publishing Company. In November 2008 she was selected by Barack Obama's office as the White House Social Secretary for the incoming administration, the first person of African-American descent to serve in this function. On February 26, 2010, the "Chicago Sun-Times"′ Lynn Sweet reported that she planned to step down. Rogers was replaced by Julianna Smoot, former chief of staff to the U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk. Smoot was the Obama presidential campaign chief fund-raiser. On August 10, 2010, Rogers was named CEO of Johnson Publishing Company.
Biography.
Rogers was born on June 16, 1959 in New Orleans, Louisiana. She is the daughter of the late Roy Glapion and his wife Joyce. Her father was the former director of sports for the New Orleans Public Schools and a member of the New Orleans City Council. Her mother ran day-care centers. She has one brother, Roy A. Glapion, a businessman who is active in civic life in New Orleans. Rogers is a descendant of Voudou priestess Marie Laveau Glapion. Rogers graduated from the Academy of the Sacred Heart in New Orleans in 1977. She earned a Bachelor's degree in political science from Wellesley College in 1981. Rogers earned a MBA from Harvard Business School in 1985. 
After graduate school, Rogers married John W. Rogers, Jr. and moved to Chicago, Illinois, where she began her career. They have one daughter together. They are divorced.Rogers was named twice as queen of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club, a Mardi Gras krewe dating back to 1916. She was first queen in 1988. Her father was instrumental in leading the krewe from a dwindling band of fewer than 100 black men in the early 1970s to a robust, financially healthy and racially integrated krewe by the 1990s. Glapion served variously as finance chairman, president and chairman of the Zulu board. In 2000 Rogers reprised the reign in honor of her father, who died in 1999. Rogers' mother, Joyce Glapion, now retired, was also active in Carnival. Rogers is an Obama family friend. Her former husband, also Obama's Inaugural Co-Chair, is a former teammate of Michelle Obama's brother Craig Robinson on the Princeton University basketball team. Rogers' brother and mother still live in New Orleans. Rogers is a survivor of breast cancer, following a diagnosis in 2003.
Career.
After graduate school, Rogers moved to Chicago, Illinois, and began working for AT&T. Soon thereafter, she became an executive for restaurant and real estate developer Larry Levy.
In 1990, Rogers was appointed by Republican Governor Jim Edgar, to run the Illinois State Lottery, a $2 billion state agency. She led the agency until 1997. During her tenure, Rogers worked extensively with over 8000 retailers to increase the sale of instant ticket products from 300 million to over 600 million. Rogers attended the 1992 Republican National Convention as an alternate delegate.
Beginning in 1997, Rogers worked as vice-president of corporate communications for Peoples Energy (PE), which is now a natural gas subsidiary of the Integrys Energy Group. In 2000 she was promoted to Chief Marketing Officer, then to Senior Vice President of Customer Service. She advanced to Vice President of Corporate Communications. In September 2001, she became senior vice-president of the overall corporation and its utility subsidiaries.
In 2003 Rogers was named to the board of Equity Residential, a $15 billion residential real estate investment trust (REIT).
In 2002, Rogers attended the Harvard Kennedy School Women and Power Program. This program was designed for senior women executives, particularly private sector executives who have demonstrated an interest in public leadership. 
In July 2004 Rogers was selected as president of both Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, the two utility subsidiaries of PE. She was the first female African-American to hold those posts. It was a time when the company faced major challenges, implementing an overall restructuring of critical business functions to meet financial targets while increasing customer satisfaction. As PEs president, Rogers improved response times at the customer service center, converted paper records of inspection results to an electronic system, and eliminated a massive backlog of home gas meter inspections.
In April 2006, the Illinois Commerce Commission launched an investigation to see if employees falsified safety reports on some of its gas pipes. State inspectors found that about 40% of the pipes had inadequate corrosion protection. More seriously, at about 10% of the locations where PE had provided positive test results, the inspectors could not find any monitoring equipment to take a reading, raising questions about whether false results had been recorded. Rogers determined the extent of the corrosion-testing problems, installed a new training and auditing regimen, and hired quality-control employees to check compliance work. To date, no leaks have been found. 
Peoples Energy was bought by Wisconsin-based WPS Resources Corporation in July 2006. The merged companies became the Integrys Energy Group in the first quarter of 2007. Rogers initially stayed on as President of Peoples Energy, the gas subsidiaries of the new holding company. 
In July 2008 Rogers joined Allstate Financial, a business unit of The Allstate Corporation, to run a new social networking initiative of the company. The initiative would connect middle-market consumers with other like-minded consumers of the enterprise. She became a member of Allstate Financial's Executive Committee.
In late 1999 Rogers and three other minority women quit the board of the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art to protest what they regarded as a slow pace on diversity issues. They were the only female minority members among the museum's 63 trustees. 
Rogers is a board member of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, the Northwestern Memorial Foundation and The Polk Foundation. 
Rogers is Vice-Chairman of the Lincoln Park Zoo and serves on the executive committee of Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. Previously, she served as the Chairman of the Board of the Chicago Children's Museum. Rogers is also a major contributor to fund-raisers to help Chicago win its bid for the 2016 Olympics, to which she donated more than US$100,000.
Roger's previous year's income, in a 2009 report, was a $350,000 salary from Allstate Financial, as well as $150,000 in board fees from Equity Residential, a real estate investment trust in which she also held at least $250,000 in stock. She also collected $20,000 in board fees from Blue Cross. Other assets reported in her checking account, stock investments, and mutual funds totaled at least $2 million.
Rogers aspired to modernize the art collection in the White House Presidential mansion by adding ethnic art.
White House gatecrash incident.
Rogers was in the center of the controversy surrounding Tareq and Michaele Salahi, where the couple was able to enter, uninvited, a November 2009 state dinner hosted by President Obama in honor of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The Secret Service ultimately took the blame for the failure after Democratic-majority members of the House Committee on Homeland Security voted against issuing Rogers a subpoena. According to "The Washington Post", details of the dinner planning meeting between Rogers's office and Secret Service personnel are "being guarded by the administration as a virtual state secret."
Life after The White House.
After her stint as Social Secretary, Rogers was appointed the chief executive officer of the Johnson Publishing Company, overseeing publication of "Ebony" and "Jet" magazines.

Ralph Sampson III

Ralph Lee Sampson III (born January 5, 1990) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Nilan Bisons Loimaa of the Finnish top league Korisliiga.
High school.
Ralph Sampson III's father Ralph Sampson, Jr. was the first overall pick in the 1983 NBA Draft and a 4-time NBA All-Star. Born in Duluth, Georgia, Ralph Sampson III graduated from Northview of Johns Creek, Georgia in 2008. Sampson led the Northview basketball team to the state championship games in his freshman and sophomore years, 2005 and 2006. In his senior year, Northview went 21-9 and made the state tournament for the first time. Sampson averaged 19.3 points, 10.3 rebounds and 7.0 blocks as a senior.
College.
During his freshman year at the University of Minnesota (2008-09 season), the 6' 11" Sampson started every Big Ten Conference game, helped the Gophers earn a NCAA tournament bid, and finished second on the team in both rebounds and blocked shots per game. Sampson started at forward and center in his sophomore and junior seasons for the Gophers and saw his minutes, points, and blocks per game increase each year. However, Sampson's senior year at Minnesota was a disappointment due to injuries. As one of the lone veterans on the team, Sampson's stats declined as he played nearly six fewer minutes per game than he did his junior season while averaging only 7.9 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. After injuring his knee during a practice in March, Sampson was inactive for the rest of the season including the Big Ten tournament and the postseason NIT. Despite being injured during his senior year, Ralph finished as one of the top three Golden Gopher centers of all time. He joined Kevin McHale and Mychal Thompson as one of the only Minnesota centers to amass more than 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, and 200 blocks during their respective collegiate careers.
Professional career.
After going undrafted in the 2012 NBA draft, he joined the Charlotte Bobcats for the 2012 NBA Summer League. In November 2012, Sampson was acquired by the Reno Bighorns of the NBA Development League. In his debut with Reno, a 101-95 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors on November 30, 2012, Sampson played 12 minutes and scored 2 points off 1-for-2 shooting. He also made 2 rebounds and 1 block.
In September 2013, Sampson signed with Nilan Bisons Loimaa of Finland.

Spirit of Mystery

Spirit of Mystery is a replica of the Mount's Bay lugger "Mystery" which made a voyage to Australia in 1854/55. In 1854 a discussion in the Star Inn in Newlyn led seven fishermen to set sail in the hope of finding their fortunes. 116 days later, their Cornish lugger, "Mystery", a 37 ft fishing boat that had never previously been out of sight of land, arrived in Melbourne, 12,000 miles away.
Construction.
"Spirit of Mystery" was built at Millbrook by Chris Rees for Pete Goss. Construction took ten months. She is a replica of "Mystery", which made a return voyage to Australia in 1854–55. "Spirit of Mystery" was launched on 21 June 2008. Incorporated into "Spirit of Mystery" is wood from "Cutty Sark", and HMS "Victory", with some of the rigging coming from SS "Great Britain".
Construction of "Spirit of Mystery" closely followed the design of the original luggers. The only concessions to modernity are watertight bulkheads and heavier ballast. Electrics have been fitted as it is a legal requirement to have navigation lights. An engine has been fitted but will not be used on the journey to Australia. Internally, oil lamps will be used, and navigation will be by the sun and stars, although a satellite tracking device allows the progress of "Spirit of Mystery" to be followed on the internet. As on the original "Mystery", a coke stove is installed. However, the diet and clothing of the crew are to modern standards, and there is a toilet and gas cooker on board.
History.
Voyage to Australia.
"Spirit of Mystery" left Newlyn at 18:00 on 20 October 2008, bound for Cape Town, just as "Mystery" did in 1854. Pete Goss is reported to have been in such a hurry to leave that he left his socks and pants in a tumble dryer at a launderette. "Spirit of Mystery" crossed the Equator on 21 November 2008. The crew is Andy Goss, Eliot Goss, Pete Goss and Andy Maidment. "Spirit of Mystery" arrived in Cape Town on 25 December 2008 "Spirit of Mystery" left Cape Town on 13 January 2009, with an estimated arrival time in Australia of the first week in March.
At 09:30 hrs local time on 4 March 2009, "Spirit of Mystery" was hit by a wave which rolled her more than 90 degrees on her side. Although she righted herself, Mark Maidment sustained a broken leg in the incident. The boat's liferaft and dinghy were lost overboard in the incident.
