Mervyn Burtch

Mervyn Burtch MBE is a Welsh composer born (1929) and resident in Ystrad Mynach, Wales.
Mervyn Burtch was born in Ystrad Mynach in 1929. Except during two years of National Service in the RAF, he has lived his entire life in the Rhymney Valley. He attended Lewis’ School in Pengam, and was inspired to become a composer when he watched his teacher, David Wynne, copying out parts, and decided that was the kind of work he would like to do. He studied at Cardiff University, and subsequently became Head of Music at Bargoed Grammar Technical School, and then Head of Music at Lewis Girls’ School in Ystrad Mynach. In 1979 he joined the staff of the Welsh College of Music and Drama and was Head of the Performance course at the College until 1989. Since then he has devoted himself to composition. His extensive output of instrumental and vocal works now includes 14 string quartets, 9 short operas and a one of a kind concerto for piano and brass band.
Drawing on his experience as a teacher, he has been especially successful in composing for young musicians. In 1984 the WCMD began its Schools’ Opera Program under his direction, and he wrote some dozen short children’s operas that were performed by more than 80,000 schoolchildren. Then in 1996, together with Canadian author and educator Mark Morris he founded the international KidsOp project. This won a prestigious Cable and Wireless Childnet Award in 1998. In 2003 Mervyn Burtch was awarded the MBE for his services to music and education in Wales, and for his work as President of KidsOp.
In collaboration with Mark Morris he has written six operas combining the resources of young performers and professional musicians, and he has developed close ties with Canada. He has coached and taken part in productions at The Banff Centre and other venues in Alberta, as well as assisting in the exchange of both child and adult musicians and singers between Canada and Wales. Their first collaboration, Coyote and the Winter that Never Ends was produced in Wetaskiwin, Alberta in 1997. The second opera, Wizard Things was produced the following year in Cardiff, Wetaskiwin, Edmonton and London (UK). Their most successful work, The Raven King was first produced in Blackwood, Wales in 1999, with subsequent productions in Canada (Banff), South Africa, Cardiff, Germany, Ireland and Mexico. These were developed as a collaborative project via the internet; children in the different countries exchanged their ideas through chat-rooms on the KidsOp web-site and contributed stories and drawings. The following year, 500 Welsh schoolchildren took part in a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The opera’s subject is the complex relationships between humans and animals, and how they can learn to communicate and live together in harmony. Scoring is for Orff percussion orchestra, piano duet and solo percussionist.
The project’s fifth opera, Jason and Hanna was premiered in Caerphilly in 2003, and in 2008 received its second performance at the CanWest Performing Arts Centre in Winnipeg. Its libretto, inspired by the tragedy of the war in the Balkans during the 1990s tells a story of young lovers doomed by the enmity of their families. This is the real life story of Admira Ismić and Boško Brkić, ‘The Romeo and Juliet of Sarajevo’, who were shot by snipers while attempting to escape from Sarajevo in 1993. A seventh opera, Twm Siôn Cati, (the 16th century ‘Welsh Robin Hood’), was written in 2005 in collaboration with Simon Rees. It was premiered in Wales by the Caerphilly Borough KidsOp group.
‘The Competition of the Birds and the Beasts’ is a semi-staged work, 40 minutes long, for choir, mezzo soprano and baritone soloists and orchestra, with libretto by Simon Rees; it concerns a song contest for the birds and beasts. It was commissioned by WNOMAX which is the education arm of the Welsh National Opera, and was performed in Cardiff (St David’s Hall) in July 2010 with a choir of 200 junior school children, two soloists drawn from the chorus of Welsh National Opera and the WNO orchestra.
A significant portion of Mervyn Burtch’s prodigious output is choral, and some of his works in this genre are well known, including his popular arrangements of Welsh folk songs which the National Youth Choir of Wales recorded in 1999. He was influenced early in his career by the music of Leoš Janáček, and a characteristic of his vocal writing is the frequent use of irregular metres, which add vitality and preserve the fluency of the native speech rhythms of the text. The Cardiff Polyphonic Choir under Simon Lovell-Jones recorded eight selections some years ago for Black Mountain Records. The texts set in these works cover a wide range from the Anglican Liturgy to Welsh and Chinese poets and Robert Hillyer’s translation of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. This piece, Egyptian Litany, composed in 1994, is particularly beautiful.
Mervyn Burtch is a modest man who likes to be in the centre of things rather than out front. He once said he regretted not having learned the viola so he could play in a string quartet. To celebrate his 80th birthday year in 2009, he composed a new Piano Trio that was premiered on June 13 at the Gregynog Festival in mid-Wales.
In 1991 Burtch received the John Edwards Memorial Award, one of Wales' most prestigious music honours, for the promotion of Welsh Music.

Saib Tabrizi (, "Ṣāʾib Tabrīzī", میرزا محمّدعلی صائب تبریزی, "Mīrzā Muḥammad ʿalī Ṣāʾib", ; 1601/02-1677) also called Saib Isfahani (, "Ṣāʾib Eṣfahānī") was a Persian poet and one of the greatest masters of a form of classical Arabic and Persian lyric poetry characterized by rhymed couplets, known as the ghazal. Besides writing in Persian, Saib was known to have written 17 ghazals and molammaʿs in his native Azeri.
Saib was born in Tabriz, and educated in Isfahan and in about 1626/27 he traveled to India, where he was received into the court of Shah Jahan. He stayed for a time in Kabul and in Kashmir, returning home after several years abroad. After his return, the emperor of Persia, Shah Abbas II, bestowed upon him the title "King of Poets".
Saib's reputation is based primarily on some 300,000 couplets, including his epic poem "Qandahār-nāma" (“The Campaign Against Qandahār”). His “Indian style” verses reveal an elegant wit, a gift for the aphorism and the proverb, and a keen appreciation of philosophical and intellectual exercise. Saib was especially well known for his Persian panegyric poetry during the reigns of Persian Emperors Safi, Abbas II and Suleiman.
A line from Saib's poem on Kabul provided the title for Khaled Hosseini's 2007 novel, "A Thousand Splendid Suns".

Marine Commandos

The Marine Commandos ( = "marine commandos"/"commandos of the sea"; singular مَغْوَار "maghwār" = Levantine Arabic "commando", from غَارَ "ghāra" = "he invaded"; البحر = al Baħr = of the sea) are an elite unit of the Lebanese Navy. They are part of the Lebanese Special Operations Command. 
History.
Until 1997, the only Special Operations Force in Lebanon was the Commando Regiment. However, in 1997, as part of the reconstruction and the modernization of the Lebanese Army, the army command decided to establish a designated regiment for Maritime Special operations.
Contacts to establish and train this new multi-purpose special unit started by approaching the U.S. and by contacting the UK Ministry of Defense. Eventually a number of officer candidates were sent to train with the Royal Marines in the UK. Lower ranks were put through their paces in Lebanon by Royal Marine commandos especially imported for the task. On the other hand, it is confirmed that the U.S. Navy SEALs contributed in the training in both U.S. and Lebanon.
Main tasks.
The tasks of the Lebanese Marine Commandos in general are to counter enemy watercraft, conduct under-water raids, deploy and dispose of naval mines, underwater demolition, conducting joint operations with the navy, land, and air forces, and maritime counter-terrorism. In addition, the regiment is tasked with sustaining the internal security and performing search and rescue missions.
Uniform and insignia.
The regiment's uniform consists of black or U.S. style Woodland Camouflage fatigues, desert combat boots and a bordeaux beret with the regiment's insignia. In 2008, the unit also adopted the U.S. Digital Desert Camouflage to become a part of their uniforms.
The regiment's trident insignia, which is identical to that of the U.S. Navy SEAL trident with the addition of a Cedar tree, is usually worn high on the left shoulder.The black uniform has an additional insignia on the right shoulder consisting of the red sword and the word "commando" in red above the sword - this is identical to the insignia worn on the shoulder of the British Royal Marines.
Weapons, equipment and vehicles.
The units weapons mainly consist of U.S. weapons. Various weapons are used such as the M4 Carbine with M203 grenade launcher, Heckler & Koch MP5N submachine gun, AKS-74U and M16 assault rifles, FN Minimi light machine gun, Barrett M107 .50 Cal. sniper rifle, M24 sniper rifle, Franchi LAW-12 shotgun, M72 LAW, At-4, Mk 19 grenade launcher.
Their vehicles are the only ones among the other Lebanese Army units to be in a desert camouflage, which comes in different patterns, including a digital pattern. Nevertheless, some vehicles are in green camouflage. The list of their vehicles includes M113, M113 Nagman, HMMWV, CUCV, Toyota Land Cruiser, M151 MUTT jeep, M35.
Selection and training.
"Reference for all this section "
Special Forces School.
The first step for any commando in Lebanon is at the Special Forces School, where those looking to join any of the Special Forces units receive their first training. The school is responsible for preparing those members through special fundamental courses. At the end the graduates join their units, where they will perform, in addition to their usual tasks, what they have learned during the courses.
Twenty hours of training daily
Commander of the school Commando Lieutenant Colonel Marwan Issa explains that the students undergo during the fundamental course, which spans three months, heavy military training, sometimes reaching 20 hours per day, and it is divided into three stages:
In addition, this stage includes various calisthenics, and walking. During it, the member is exposed to severe psychological pressure like difficulties, hardships, sleep-deprevation, and not getting any chance to rest. Only those who pass this stage can move on to the next.
From the school to the patrolling base
This phase starts by moving from the school to a patrolling base in deserted land. It begins from the sea, where the members are isolated in the landing boat for 24 hours, followed by three hours of rowing from 3:30 AM until 6:30 AM. After this, the members land on the shore and move towards the patrolling base. Reaching the base takes around 12 to 14 hours of walking with full gear (around 25 kg). This walk starts at altitude zero and ends at around 1400 meters above sea level. In the base, the practical application of the various technical lessons, including the combat patrolling (ambushing and raiding), and surveillance patrolling takes place. The first three weeks of this training involve combat within enemy territory that's why it is performed at night, which forces the members to work for 20 hours per day.
Who makes it till the end
At the end of the third week, the members perform the imprisonment and retrieve prisoners' patrol, which is considered one of the toughest because members play the role of the prisoners and they undergo real torture similar to what they might face if they get captured by the enemy. On the fourth week (after the enemy is defeated), work is performed day and night to chase the enemy, where they begin tracing the enemy and perform different hits ranging from ambushes to raids, in addition to the "hammer and anvil patrol" in which they surround and finish-off the enemy. At the end, the members walk back to the school, a walk between 80 and 100 km, again with full gear.
Fifteen percent of the initial number of students makes it to the graduation where they are given a commando certificate.
Additional courses
Navy SEALs selection and training.
Graduates from the Special Forces School, in addition other candidates, can join the Marine Commandos. The selection of those who are not graduates from the Special Forces School follows a strict guideline: a candidate, preferably below 21, must be fit, have physical strength, and have mental clarity in order to pass the early stages which include calisthenics in addition to physiological pressure assessments. Passing those tests allow the candidate to continue and follow the "naval commando" training. Once the candidate passes this training, he can join the Marine Commandos.
The selection and training process for the Marine Commandos is extremely demanding and rigorous and lasts around six to seven months. Candidates, other than graduates of the Special Forces School, are eligible to join from all of Lebanon’s armed forces. Barely 15 per cent make the grade.
The course of the Marine Commandos is split into phases similar to the that of the U.S. Navy SEALs 'BUD/S':
The fundamental training is the basic course that a Marine Commando undergoes directly after graduating from the school of Special Forces and joining the regiment. This training lasts for eight weeks and includes lessons on swimming, abseiling, handling of small boats, orienting, landing on the beach using RHIBs, in addition to lessons and maneuvers with the Navy.
This stage includes "Week of Hell" course, which is a whole week of arduous and strenuous training that includes a lot of physical pain and oppression. The soldiers push themselves to the limits to apply what is requested during a training that lasts more than 20 hours per day duringwhich they only sleep for two hours.
The goal behind this week is to fortify the capabilities and strengths of the soldiers to endure more and to sustain in front of the severe conditions which they might face during their future operations. It emphasizes on the candidates' physical aptitude and abilities.
At the end of the fundamental training, the members are distributed to the different platoons of the regiment in which they follow complementary training according to their specialization. Among the training:
In addition to those courses, the complementary training includes different technical courses such as explosives expert course, which is followed at the Engineering Regiment, driving and mechanical maintenance course, followed at the Logistics Brigade, that's in addition to map-reading, orienting, and radio courses.
An advanced stage of the training in each member specializes in a specific military field, such as:
The peak of the training courses at the Marine Commandos is the combat diving course, which is only followed by a small number of highly capable and efficient members. An entrance examination is required. This examination involves 9 km of swimming, 52 meters of underwater crossing, in addition to running, push ups, and sit ups. This course lasts for 18 months, and it is intended to prepare professional fighters capable of using the sea as a way to infiltrate onto the shores and conduct naval special operations and special operations behind enemy lines.
The course includes a number of cruel and cumbersome exercises such as, quick walking, running on the sand, long distance swimming, crossing tens of meters under water, swimming with tied hands and legs, dealing with ropes underwater, etc... All this in order to enhance the combat capabilities and the efficiency of the soldier, in addition to enhance his confidence in his capabilities.
The divers also follow lessons in dealing with explosives either on land or underwater, scanning and searching the shores, weaponology, dealing with boats and helicopters, radio, reading maps, survival, unarmed combat, sailing and rowing, diving accidents, special diving and environmental instructions, defensive diving (open circuit, compresses air) that reaches 60 meters deep, attack diving (closed circuit, 100% oxygen) which reaches 200 meters underwater during day and night, and helocasting boat recovery whereby the swimmer is pulled from the water by a moving boat.
Scenarios for this training includes combat patrolling that begin in the sea then attack a beach either to occupy it or clean it from obstacles and mines, which is a preparation for the following friendly units. Another scenario includes moving from the beach to raid an enemy base or radar, or to conduct an ambush against a moving enemy.
Graduates of this course are 25% of the original number, and they are considered the elite of the Navy SEALs.
With a week-long break between each segment, selection and training is extremely demanding both physically and mentally which is why there is such as high attrition rate.
Major Melad-Helali stated when asked about the training course: "If a man wants out, we don't stop him. I don't want him here just for the job, as a statistic. While he is in the unit I demand nothing less than his every thinking moment of the day".
A 12 hour daily training program is followed by all accepted soldiers of this regiment. It includes running for 7 to 8 km daily, journeys of the warrior, and aerial journeys. In addition to this, training on firing is done at least twice per month.
It is allowed to lose five men during the course. The command will consider that something acceptable and will not move against the person in charge.
Operational deployments.
This regiment was always among the first to be called upon when major trouble took place. In addition, it is notable that this is the only unit in the Lebanese Army to perform an operation outside Lebanon, however, it was only a search and rescue mission.
In addition to those operations, the Marine Commandos were used to restore and maintain order in some Lebanese cities at different occasions whenever major clashes or turbulences took place.
Special Operations Command.
In 2008, the Lebanese Army started establishing the Special Operations command in order to group the Army's elite units. Among the regiments that were included are the Lebanese Marine Commandos.

Arbovirus (band)

Arbovirus is a rock band based out of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Formed by guitarist Suharto Sherif, guitarist and lyricist Asif Asgar (a.k.a. "Ranjan"), and
drummer Himel while in College in 2002. The band grew to include bassist Ishtiaq Jishan and vocalist Sufi Maverick.
The name Arbovirus is derived from the Blade II comic book, where the virus is mentioned as the one that, once transmitted through saliva, turns human into a vampire.
Their lyrics cover various elements from self-recognition to the political disarray of Bangladesh, from the 9-6 corporate life to middle-east peace politics, although they focus on a broader humane and optimistic view.
Arbovirus has earned mainstream recognition with the release of their 2006 album "64m 53s". Their second album "Montobbo Nishproyojon" was released online on July 5th 2013.
History.
Beginnings, era with no permanent drummer, and bassist.
Guitarist Asif Asgar (a.k.a. "Ranjan"), Suharto Sharif, and Drummer Himel were school mates and started playing when they were in the high school. The band was practicing back then just for fun and passion. Several musicians played in this band in order to get the raw satisfaction through unorthodox jamming sessions. Until 2002 when Suharto was about to participate the Benson & Hedges Star Search with the single "Artonad", and planned to form a band, not just for recreation and fun..but beyond that! Till then the band had no permanent vocal and bassist.
Change in line-up with new vocal, drummer and bassist.
They kept practicing, doing covers of their favourite bands like Pantera, Nirvana, Godsmack and many others. So far they had only one full length track that would give them a full length album deal with G-Series. In March 2003, Shobhon and Himel left the band due to personal and creative differences. Now Arbovirus really needed a new vocal, a new drummer as well as a bassist for the song.
In August 2003, bassist Ishtiaq Jishan and drummer Farhan Tanim (ex-Metal Maze) joined Arbovirus.
Cézanne of Artcell recommended to check out Sufi (whom he came to know on one of Artcell's jamming session), and Jishan. On a Volvo double-decker bus Cézanne introduced Sufi to Ranjan. Sufi had another casual interview at Rajan's house where he met rest of the band including Suharto, Tanim, and Jishan. Sufi had no previous experience of singing in any other bands, so it was a totally raw journey for Arbovirus too.
"Agantuk 2" (2004).
"Agantuk 2", Arbovirus' first released single 'Aartonad' (cries of dispare), was released on November 12, 2004.
With the new line up Arbovirus performed in several big gigs including Russian Cultural Center, Engineer's Institute Auditorium, Mohanogor Natyo Moncho, and Shishu Academy.
"More Singles" (2004-2006).
from 2004 to 2006, after releasing of their first single 'Aartonad' they released 'Obhishap' (Curse) in the album 'Din Bodol' and 'Shopnadishto' (Instructed-in-dream).
"64m 53s" (2006).
Arbovirus, after releasing 3 singles, took some time off to record their debut album "64m 53s".
The whole album was a totally different experience for the band, since it was their debut album. Arbovirus took 1 long year to produce this album under the banner of G-series,
produced by Iqbal Asif Jewel.
The album recording was done on 'Studio Bass', 'Dream Desk'. Mixing and Mastering was done in
'Not of this earth'.
Their album covers genre from Grunge and Hard rock to Psychedelic rock.
"64m 53s" was released on July 20, 2006 under the banner of G - Series.
They began performing in acoustic shows, specially organized by LiveSquare.
With increasing interest in the song among the listeners, radio stations began playing "Ja ichhe ta" and the studio version of "Omanush". Arbovirus made videos for Omanush, Obhishap, and Aartonad with the help of famous music video producers like Ilajar Islam Rajib and Rommo Khan.
On January 26, 2006, Arbovirus performed at the Salt Lake Stadium on the eve of Indian Republic Day along with Artcell, Metal Maze, and Fossils. This was their fist performance outside Bangladesh.
On October 1, 2010, they have performed at the BAMBA Concert for Sundarban at the Dhaka Army Stadium along with Miles, L.R.B., Artcell, Nemesis and others.
LiveSquare is currently managing all their shows and tours.
Future (2008–later).
After October 2008, bassist Jishan moved to Arizona to pursue his career as a software engineer, who now works for Facebook. Aldnane Alam replaced him after Jishan left.
In February 2009, drummer Tanim also moved to UK to pursue higher education. After almost a year's on-and-off audition - Muntasir Mamun Shubho of Aurthohin filled the position. It was also his engagement with music after 4 years long hiatus. Later - he migrated to Australia around February 2012 - so Nafeez Al Amin (ex-Dethrow, ex-Breach, ex-Groovetrap)replaced him.
On July 5th, 2013 Arbovirus has released their much awaited 2nd album "Montobbyo Nishproyojon" (No Comments Required) which was powered by Sprint and managed by LiveSquare. The recording of the album started from mid January 2013 on Acoustic Artz, Phi Studio, and at the personal studio of Kumar Bishwajit. Instead of releasing in the form of Compact Disc, and under the banner of a record label - they uploaded the entire album online and set for (guilt) free download.
They have more materials ready for the 3rd album and an EP.
Style and Influences.
Five heads of Arbovirus have got totally five different types of musical taste. 
With their earlier albums in particular the band displayed a large amount of experimental qualities, mixing traditional as well as contemporary genres such as heavy metal, punk rock, Nu metal, and grunge with funk, and mainstream hard rock.
Throughout their career Arbovirus has utilized elements from a wide variety of genres and styles, receiving complements from the critics focusing the band's ambition and potential, though it has also made them difficult to correctly classify. Most conclude that Arbovirus is, at its basis, a rock band. 
The band has plans to use various Indian Musical Instruments and various Electronic music, Industrial music elements in their upcoming tracks. Glimpse of these can be enjoyed on their tracks 'Keu Karo Noy'.
Their recent collaboration with acclaimed DJ Werd Pace, Rapper Amewu and Beat boxer Shanto in their collaboration tracks have added a totally different sound contributing and enriching Bangla Rock Music.
Associated Acts.
Besides their vivid music career - band members also have participated in several projects.
Guitarist Ranjan is a lyricist for quite a long time, long before he formed the band. He has contributed lyrics to many prominent musicians including Miles, Artcell, and Aurthohin.
Besides - he has an experimental project named Purple Haze.
Sufi has contributed two tracks on Sisimpur, the Bangladeshi version of the children's television series "Sesame Street".
In 2010 - under the pseudo name PHI - two of his first ever solo tracks have been released in the mixed album "Shomoy" under the banner of Gangchil.

Becoming a US citizen in 1959, he discharged his military obligation as a civilian researcher for the US Air Force, conducting simulation studies in support of the Mercury Astronaut Space Selection Program
His interest in psychoanalysis led him to the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, from which he graduated in 1967. His research and theoretical orientation consistently favored an empirical, inter-disciplinary approach and he became part of a like-minded group of psychoanalysts that established "Psychoanalysis and Contemporary Thought," of which he served as editor for 27 years. He was also the founder and general editor of "Psychoanalytic Crosscurrents" and "Essential Papers in Psychoanalysis," book series published by New York University Press. A frequent consultant to publishers, including Basic Books, Bruner-Mazel, Routledge and the Behavioral Science Book Service of the Book-Of-the-Month Club, he was also a consultant to Holocaust resource centers, and to documentary film makers. He was the story consultant on the feature film "A Day in October" (1992) about the rescue of the Danish Jews.
Honors.
"The Order of Dannebrog (Knight's Cross)", awarded by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 1993.

Lost Tapes

Lost Tapes is an American television horror series that aired on Animal Planet. Produced by Go Go Luckey Entertainment, the program presents found footage depicting traumatic encounters with cryptozoological creatures (cryptids), including the Chupacabra and Bigfoot, and even supernatural creatures such as the Werewolf and Vampire, and extraterrestrials: Alien and Reptilian.
The pilot ("Chupacabra") aired on Animal Planet October 30, 2008 for Halloween, but the series officially premiered on January 6, 2009. Animal Planet commissioned a second season, which premiered on September 29, 2009. Season 3 premiered on September 28, 2010, with episodes featuring zombies and the Kraken. The show also used to air on Planet Green.
Overview.
"Lost Tapes" depicts traumatic scenarios where people are attacked and/or killed by mysterious, dangerous, deadly, savage, and ferocious paranormal wild cryptids. The series is shot in a mockumentary style. Most episodes begin with a quick introduction of facts, which include interviews with experts explaining scientific theories or facts and folklore behind the episode's titular creature. In the second season, some episodes began with footage of a person being attacked and often killed by the episode's creature, an introduction meant to set up the events of each episode. In the third season, every episode had such an introduction, though the events of every episode in all three seasons are accompanied by videos of scientists, cryptozoologists, and folklorists giving their thoughts and opinions of the creatures, which are called "Lost Tapes: Revelations".
A common formula in "Lost Tapes" involves the human characters, usually either a single person or a small group, ending up in a remote part of the world or otherwise in a place with few options of escape, such as enclosed areas like buildings or underground tunnels. They soon encounter the episode's creature in a series of stressful events, which sometimes result in the deaths of some or all of the featured characters. Many episodes end in cliffhangers which state that the creature which appeared in the episode was never found, and may "live among us". With the exception of a brief injury in "Thunderbird", no children have been physically harmed on-screen, though sometimes they become traumatized after the events of the episode, as in "Chupacabra" and "Death Raptor".
In most episodes, the creatures are often only partially revealed to the audience, and in brief glimpses or otherwise only as silhouettes, shadows, or are obscured by darkness; sometimes they are never seen at all (such as in "Thunderbird" and "Chupacabra"), but their presence is made obvious by sounds and the characters' reactions to them. To give the show a mysterious atmosphere, techniques such as those used in "Jaws" are employed, and the creatures are almost never fully seen. "Hellhound", the last episode of the first season, marked the first time that a creature was fully shown on camera, and the second season revealed more creatures than the first: in "Jersey Devil", for instance, the creature's legs, hooves, and face are briefly shown; in "Vampire", the creature's entire body can be seen on several occasions, though only briefly; and in the season's last episode, "Dover Demon", the entire creature can be seen in the background when a night vision camera is turned on. The third season showed even more creatures, and many of them in full view of the camera. However, realism was better-maintained with human-like creatures, such as in "Zombies" and "Reptilian". Even non-human-like animals were shown more frequently, though this led to some negative criticism among fans as many of the creatures in the third season were less convincing with low budget animatronics and CGI, such as in "Kraken" and "Q: The Serpent God", or even simply people in costumes, as in "Devil Monkey" and "Yeti".
While most episodes feature the titular cryptid as the antagonist, in some episodes they benefit the people that the story follows. For example, in "Bigfoot", the creature seems to be watching over and protecting the main character, even killing a poacher that was trying to attack her; "Mothman" implies that the featured cryptid was trying to warn people about the imminent collapse of a bridge.
While there is normally no connection between episodes, the third season introduced the recurring Enigma Corporation, "a private security firm that specializes in the unexplained," though it is not exactly clear what order each of the episodes featuring them is supposed to be in chronologically or if the characters Noel Connor and Elise Mooney remember their experiences in each episode, as no connection between each time besides the third (and in "Strigoi Vampire" fourth) agent being killed. The Enigma Corporation first appeared in the third season's premiere, "Zombies", and reappeared in "Strigoi Vampire" and again in "Q: The Serpent God".
Critical reception.
"Lost Tapes" has received mixed reviews from critics. In a preview of the season one DVD, TV Squad writer John Scott Lewinski gave the film a mostly unfavorable review, stating that in the case of this series, "Animal Planet could be accused of repacking a horror/sci-fi show as an animal documentary" and that much of the program is "outright bollocks." He did, however, state that the show holds some appeal for audiences looking for a scare, or "incredibly gullible people." Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the series three out of five stars, noting that while the acting was "subpar", the show overall was "simultaneously scintillating and bone-chilling."
The show currently holds a 75% "Fresh" audience score at Rotten Tomatoes.

St Neots Citizen

The St Neots Citizen is a British satirical local news service based in St Neots, Cambridgeshire.
History.
The St Neots Citizen was first published in 2001 as part of the Citizen News Network, comprising at the time the Whitley Bay Citizen, Geordie Citizen, Showbiz Citizen and many others. One by one all these sites fell into disuse and were abandoned as their domains expired.
Now.
The St Neots Citizen was resurrected in 2008 by the original editor, known to the wider world only as "Tim C", and accepts contributions from anyone although all submissions are moderated before publication.
The original creators of the Whitley Bay and Geordie citizens are currently working on Citizen Extra as a revival of the original news sources.
In February 2011 the Citizen underwent a facelift, receiving a new layout and new features. These include "Last Week's Stars", where a "resident astrologer" tells people about an event from the previous seven days; and letters from readers which are, according to the Citizen, at least fifty per cent genuine. The horoscope contains a weekly tribute to snooker player John Virgo under the Virgo sign, for no apparent reason.
Contributors and pseudonyms.
The majority of Citizen articles carry the byline "Citizen Editor" and are written by the Editor "Tim C". Other submissions come from "staff writers", including Oi!! Correspondent, Flaming Reporter, and A.J. Oke. Other contributors include PW and Adam Douglas, the latter rumoured to be a local councillor.
The Editor previously used to write under the pseudonym Geoff Ives, a nod to the multiple Geoffs and Jeffs involved in the original Citizens. The Citizen announced the appointment of "Features Editor" Francisco Sanchez in April 2010; this name is also thought to be a nom de plume of Tim C.
Site updates are posted as "Tim C" rather than "Citizen Editor", although confusingly Tim C often refers to himself in these updates in the third person.
Legal issues.
In early 2009 an unnamed local councillor mistakenly believed the site to be serious, and issues a cease-and-desist notice to the owner, citing possible slander. The notice was revoked when the owner pointed out that the site was merely for comedy purposes and not to be taken seriously.
In mid-2009, the Citizen ceased publication whilst involved in a debate over the ownership of the title "The St Neots Citizen". Editor Tim C said he could easily resolve the case by changing the name, but was "too damn stubborn." Eventually the other party, who were not named, agreed that Tim C carry on using the name as long as they were not actively publishing a newspaper called the St Neots Citizen.
Other citizens.
The St Neots Citizen is not related in any way to any other news services called Citizen, for example the MK Citizen and the Aberdeen Citizen.

Geriatric anesthesia

Geriatric anesthesia (or geriatric anaesthesia) is the branch of medicine that studies anesthesia approach in elderly.
Origin.
The perioperative care of elderly patients differs from that of younger patients for a number of reasons. Some of these can be attributed to the changes that occur in the process of aging, but many are also caused by diseases that accompany seniority. The distinction between so-called normal aging and pathological changes is critical to the care of elderly people. Anesthesia and surgery has become more common as the population survives longer. Preoperative management of the geriatric patients requires knowledges about changes associated with aging physiology and its relation to surgery and anesthesia. Only experienced anesthetists can evaluate patients effectively and plan for their perioperative care to minimize complications. Comprehensive preoperative evaluation of an elderly individual's health status can be a very challenging aspect, especially for the young anesthetist. Sir William Osler's aphorism "Listen to the patient, he'll give you the diagnosis" is as true in the elderly patient as it is in the young. But in the elderly several factors makes taking history more difficult and time-consuming. 
Many differences can be seen in geriatric anesthesia. First, the preoperative evaluation of the geriatric patient is typically more complex than that of the younger patient because of the heterogeneity of this patient group and the greater number and complexity of comorbid conditions that usually accumulate with age. Perioperative functional status can be difficult to predict because many elderly patients have reduced preoperative function as a consequence of deconditioning, age-related disease, or cognitive impairment. This makes it difficult to adequately assess the patient’s ability to respond to the specific stresses associated with surgery. A common example is trying to determine cardiopulmonary reserve in a patient very limited by osteoarthritis. Physiologic heterogeneity and decreased functional reserve are also manifested perioperatively. Normal aging results in changes in cardiac, respiratory, and renal physiology, and the response of the elderly patient to surgical stress is often unpredictable. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of elderly and younger patients also differ; moreover, the elderly patient’s use of multiple medications may alter homeostatic mechanisms.
Training and education programs.
A Syllabus on Geriatric Anesthesiology is available from the American Society of Anesthesiologists.
Online resources are also available as the Geriatric Anesthesiology Curriculum.
Graduate medical education in the United States is regulated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS). Each program must provide “appropriate didactic instruction and sufficient clinical experience in managing problems of the geriatric population.” The published joint ASA/American Board of Anesthesiology content outline for in-training examinations also includes a section on “Geriatric Anesthesia/Aging: The Pharmacological Implications, MAC Changes and the Physiological Implications on Major Organ Systems.” These mandates make geriatric education a requirement for any program in anesthesiology. This is not the rule in all graduate medical education programs. A recent survey by the Association of Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs reviewed ACGME policies required by 100 nonpediatric programs. They found that only 27 of these programs had specific requirements for geriatric training; anesthesiology and pain management were two of these.
Organization and societies.
The Society for the Advancement of Geriatric Anesthesia (SAGA) is dedicated to improving the care of the older patient coming to surgery. It offers educational programs at its annual meeting as well as at meetings of other anesthesia societies. It also offer educational support for anesthesia training programs. The Age Anaesthesia Society is the UK equivalent of SAGA.

X-bracing

X-bracing is a structural engineering innovation developed by Fazlur Khan. This concept reduces the lateral load on the building by transferring the load into the exterior columns. This allows for a reduced need for interior columns thus creating more floor space. This concept can be seen in the John Hancock Center, built in 1969. One of the most famous buildings of the structural expressionist style, the skyscraper's distinctive X-bracing exterior is actually a hint that the structure's skin is indeed part of its 'tubular system'. This idea is one of the architectural techniques the building used to climb to record heights (the tubular system is essentially the spine that helps the building stand upright during wind and earthquake loads). This X-bracing allows for both higher performance from tall structures and the ability to open up the inside floorplan (and usable floor space) if the architect desires. Original features such as the skin, pioneered by Khan, have made the John Hancock Center an architectural icon.

Ariane Sherine (born 3 July 1980) is a British comedy writer and journalist. She created the Atheist Bus Campaign, which ran in 13 countries during January 2009.
Career.
Sherine writes regularly for "The Guardian"'s Comment & Debate section, and has also written for "The Sunday Times" and "The Independent". She started in journalism aged 21, reviewing albums for "NME", before coming runner-up in the BBC Talent New Sitcom Writers' Award 2002. She then wrote comedy for British TV shows including the BBC sitcoms "My Family" and "Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps", and links for the Channel 4 quiz show "Countdown" after appearing on the show in 2003. In addition, Sherine wrote episodes of several CBBC and CITV shows, including "The Story of Tracy Beaker", "The New Worst Witch" and "Space Pirates", before returning to journalism in early 2008.
Atheism.
Sherine started the Atheist Bus Campaign in response to an evangelical Christian bus advertisement which gave the URL of a website "telling non-Christians they would spend 'all eternity in torment in hell', burning in 'a lake of fire'". She was brought up Christian; although her father is currently a Unitarian Universalist, while her mother's side of the family are Parsi Zoroastrians (though both parents are non-practising). In 2009, Sherine was nominated for Secularist of the Year 2009 (The Irwin Prize), a title awarded by the National Secular Society.
In January 2009, Sherine gave a non-religious equivalent of "Thought for the Day" on Radio 4's iPM programme. She spoke about accepting the beliefs of others as long as they are expressed peacefully, and how the freedom to hold them is more important than the beliefs themselves. Sherine's broadcast follows a similar one made by Richard Dawkins in 2002. "Thought for the Day" continues to be reserved for religious speakers in its usual slot on Radio 4's Today Programme, on weekday mornings.
In October 2009 the first atheist charity book, "The Atheist's Guide to Christmas" was released, which Sherine had been editing for the prior six months. The full advance and royalties from the book were donated to the UK HIV charity, Terrence Higgins Trust.
In late 2009, Sherine announced that she was ceasing atheist campaigning and returning to journalism and writing a novel. She remains a distinguished supporter of the British Humanist Association.

Samuel Cockburn (mercenary leader)

Major general ("generalfältvaktmästare") Samuel Cockburn (which he usually spelled Cobron) (c. 1574 – December 1621) was a Scottish soldier in the service of Sweden. He was born around 1574 in Scotland. He entered Swedish service in 1598 where he participated in the Swedish civil war between Sigismund Vasa and Duke Karl Karl IX.
He is listed as one of the Scottish officers who, under the direction of General James Spens, the General of Scottish and English forces in Swedish service, was sent to King James VI and I in 1608/9 seeking levies for Sweden, although one source notes a travel pass for this purpose issued by the Swedes was dated 17 December 1609. A group of officers went with him including Hugh Cochran, Daniel Rogers, Robert Kinnaird, Patrick Ruthven, John Wauchop, George Douglas and William Horne. He served as colonel of a regiment in 1609-10 and took part in Karl IX's and Gustav II Adolf's war in Russia and in the Baltic states.
Cockburn played a leading role in the battle of Novgorod on 16 July 1611, in particular, his regiment blew open the town gates. In July 1612 he was sent by Jacob de la Gardie at Novogorod to Gustav II Adolf to seek payment for Cockburn's troops - some of his regiment had already been sent back to Finland for lack of finances. That year 1612 he obtained 301 homesteads in Österbotten as compensation for a claim of 8,000 dalers. On 1 August 1613 Cockburn's troops landed at Narva. Cockburn was appointed Governor of Dunaw in Livonia, which was called "Fortress Cobron" after him. His regiment also formed part of the Swedish forces lent to Muscovy during the hostilities with Poland-Lithuania from 1614-16. He was at the siege of Augdow and Pskov, and relieved Ladoga. Cockburn's regiment is listed in military payrolls every year from 1611-1615, and in 1614 and a register was made of all the sick soldiers under his command. In 1615 there is a note of decommissioning payment for Cockburn and his regiment, and by May 1616 the Swedes were keen to allow the soldiers to rest and recoup in case they were needed again. According to one source his troops mutinied at Narva in 1616 (?)and he then took command of the Karelia troops. Cockburn tried in vain to get reimbursement for his loans to the Crown in June 1616, although Oxenstierna did intervene on Cockburn's behalf with the bailliff of Borga who was preventing the Scotsman from earning his keep from his land. Indeed when the Swedish-Russian peace looked imminent, Cockburn requested a transfer into Russian service, and in December 1617 this was granted by the Swedes. Cockburn was to ensure that he was only used against Poland and that he was to convince the Tsar that the Poles were weak, being engaged in war with the Turks and facing domestic opposition. Although it is intriguing that a Scotsman was considered for such intricate use in Swedish foreign policy, it appears that Cockburn and his fellow officers never did enter Russian service however. Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna intervened on his behalf in October 1616 with the local baillies of Borgå and Rassborg to leave Cockburn unmolested. There is a letter regarding Cockburn and his regiment dated 5 November 1621. At that point he was in active service on Gustav II Adolf's Livonian campaign in the renewed hostilities against Poland. Cockburn served as the commandant at Duna, near Riga in Livonia. One of the rare times Cockburn's troops were negatively described was when they were quartered in three separate villages. Axel Oxenstierna noted that Cockburn was one of the officers killed by illness by 12 February 1622. Jacob de la Gardie records that colonel Cockburn had died by March 1622, (another source erroneously notes that he died in 1631 at Åbo) but he appears to have been buried in 1621 in the Åbo Cathedral after a military campaign in Latvia. His brother Johan Cockburn [SSNE 7028? erected a marble monument to his memory. He had been married to Barbara Kinnaird 6400.

Social issues in India

Since India's Independence in 1947, the South Asian nation has faced several social and economic issues.
Overpopulation.
India suffers from the problem of overpopulation. The population of India is very high at an estimated 1.27 billion. Though India ranks second in population, it ranks 33 in population density. Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of India, had implemented a forced sterilization program in the early 1970s but the program failed. Officially, men with two children or more were required to be sterilised, but many unmarried young men, political opponents and ignorant, poor men were also believed to have been affected by this program. This program is still remembered and regretted in India, and is blamed for creating a public aversion to family planning, which hampered Government programs for decades.
Economic issues.
Poverty.
Though the high class has gained from recent positive economic developments, India suffers from substantial poverty. According to the new World Bank's estimates on poverty based on 2005 data, India has 456 million people, 41.6% of its population, living below the new international poverty line of $1.25 (PPP) per day. The world Bank further estimates that 33% of the global poor now reside in India. Moreover, India also has 828 million people, or 75.6% of the population living below $2 a day, compared to 72.2% for Sub-Saharan Africa.
Wealth distribution in India is fairly uneven, with the top 10% of income groups earning 33% of the income. Despite significant economic progress, 1/4 of the nation's population earns less than the government-specified poverty threshold of $0.40/day. Official figures estimate that 27.5% of Indians lived below the national poverty line in 2004–2005. A 2007 report by the state-run National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganized Sector (NCEUS) found that 25% of Indians, or 236 million people, lived on less than 20 rupees per day with most working in "informal labour sector with no job or social security, living in abject poverty."
Sanitation.
Lack of proper sanitation is a major concern for India. Statistics conducted by UNICEF have shown that only 31% of India’s population is able to utilise proper sanitation facilities as of 2008. It is estimated that one in every ten deaths in India is linked to poor sanitation and hygiene. Diarrhoea is the single largest killer and accounts for one in every twenty deaths. Around 450,000 deaths were linked to diarrhoea alone in 2006, of which 88% were deaths of children below five. Studies by UNICEF have also shown that diseases resulting from poor sanitation affects children in their cognitive development.
People without access to proper sanitation facilities more-often-than-not defecate in public or in rivers. One gram of faeces could potentially contain 10 million viruses, one million bacteria, 1000 parasite cysts and 100 worm eggs. The Ganga river in India has a stunning 1.1 million litres of raw sewage being disposed into it every minute. The high level of contamination of the river by human waste allow diseases like cholera to spread easily, resulting in many deaths, especially among children who are more susceptible to such viruses.
A lack of adequate sanitation also leads to significant economic losses for the country. A Water and sanitation Program (WSP) study The Economic Impacts of Inadequate Sanitation in India (2010) showed that inadequate sanitation caused India considerable economic losses, equivalent to 6.4 per cent of India’s GDP in 2006 at US$53.8 billion (Rs.2.4 trillion). In addition, the poorest 20% of households living in urban areas bore the highest per capita economic impacts of inadequate sanitation.
Recognising the importance of proper sanitation, the Government of India started the Central Rural Sanitation Program (CRSP) in 1986, in hope of improving the basic sanitation amenities of rural areas. This program was later reviewed and, in 1999, the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) was launched. Programs such as Individual Household Latrines (IHHL), School Sanitation and Hygiene Education (SSHE), Community Sanitary Complex, Anganwadi toilets were implemented under the TSC.
Through the TSC, the Indian Government hopes to stimulate the demand for sanitation facilities in its less-urbanised areas, rather than to continually provide these amenities to these area's residents. This is a two-pronged strategy, where the people involved in this program take ownership and better maintain their sanitation facilities, and at the same time, reduces the liabilities and costs on the Indian Government. This would allow the government to reallocate their resources to other aspects of development. Thus, the government set the objective of granting access to toilets to all by 2017. To meet this objective, incentives are given out to encourage participation from the rural population to construct their own sanitation amenities. In addition, the government has set out to educate its people on the importance and benefits of proper sanitation through mass communication and interpersonal communication techniques. This is done through mass and print media to reach out to a larger audience and through group discussions and games to better engage and interact with the individual.
Corruption.
Corruption is widespread in India. India is ranked 95 out of a 179 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, but its score has improved consistently from 2.7 in 2002 to 3.1 in 2011. Historically, corruption has taken the role of a pervasive aspect of Indian politics and bureaucracy.
In India, corruption takes the form of bribes, tax evasion, exchange controls, embezzlement, etc. A 2005 study done by Transparency International (TI) India found that more than 50% had firsthand experience of paying bribe or peddling influence to get a job done in a public office. The chief economic consequences of corruption are the loss to the exchequer, an unhealthy climate for investment and an increase in the cost of government-subsidised services. Corruption has also been implicated in the lack of innovation and translational research in science and technology within India. The TI India study estimates the monetary value of petty corruption in 11 basic services provided by the government, like education, healthcare, judiciary, police, etc., to be around Rs.21,068 crores. India still ranks in the bottom quartile of developing nations in terms of the ease of doing business, and compared to China and other lower developed Asian nations, the average time taken to secure the clearances for a startup or to invoke bankruptcy is much greater.
Education.
Initiatives.
Since the Indian Constitution was completed in 1949, education has remained one of the priorities of the Indian government. The first education minister Maulana Azad founded a system of education which aimed to provide free education at the primary level. Primary education was made free and compulsory for children from 6-14, and child labour was banned. The government introduced incentives to education and disincentives for not receiving education – for instance, the provision of mid-day meals in schools were introduced. Many similar initiatives echoed, and the largest of such initiatives is Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, which actively promoted “Education for All”. In line with this, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) aimed to increase their expenditure on education to 6% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from values fluctuating about 3% through their National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) in 2004. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act was also imposed in 2009. Despite these initiatives, education continues to persist as an impediment to development.
linkage between education and economic growth.
There is a direct linkage between education and economic growth. This was given by Theodore W. Schultz.
Here labour plays a very important role.
Measurement of returns to school.
Measurement of returns to school (r) is measured by:
Y*= wages of illiterate people
Y= wages of people after education
C= cost of education
r= (Y — Y*)/(Y* + C)
Where Y — Y* is benefit.
Now this is only for 1 year
so,
Y — Y*/(Y* + C)x
Where x is the number of years.
For developed countries Y* is higher than the developing countries. But the leap from Y* to Y is greater in developing countries.
Therefore in developing countries the rate of returns to school is much much higher. In developing countries the rate of return of investing on human capital is much higher.
There is a difference between the rate of returns for boys and girls.
The returns is very less in comparison to boys. The rate of return for boys is much greater.
This mathematical formula was given by Psacharopoulos. He was a Greek economist.
Issues.
While many schools were built, they had poor infrastructure and inadequate facilities. Schools in the rural areas were especially affected. According to District Information System for Education (DISE) in India in 2009, only about 51.5% of all schools in India have boundary walls, 16.65% have computers and 39% have electricity. Of which, only 6.47% of primary schools and 33.4% of upper primary schools have computers, and only 27.7% of primary schools have electricity. Learning in poorly furnished schools was not conducive, resulting in poor quality education.
Furthermore, the absence rates of teachers and students were high, while their retainment rates low. The incentives for going to school were not apparent, while punishment for absence was not enforced. Despite the government’s decree on compulsory education and the child labour ban, many children were still missing classes to go to work. The government did not interfere even when children missed school.
Also, online country studies publications by the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress stated that “it was not unusual for the teacher to be absent or even to subcontract the teaching work to unqualified substitutes”. This exacerbates the problems of the lack of qualified teachers. Currently, the student-teacher ratio remains high at around 32, which is not much of an improvement since 2006 when the ratio was 34.
Economic and social disparities also plague the fundamentals of the education system. Rural children are less able to receive education because of greater opportunity costs, since rural children have to work to contribute to the family’s income. According to the Annual Status of Education in 2009, the average attendance rate of students in the rural states is about 75%. Though this rate varies significantly, states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar had more than 40% absentees during a random visit to their schools. In the urban states, more than 90% of the students were present in their schools during a visit.
Violence.
Religious violence.
Constitutionally India is a secular state,
Although related, Hinduism and Hindutva are different. Hinduism is a religion while Hindutva is a political ideology. The Hindutva movement is not supported by majority of Hindus. Some tolerant or "secular" Hindus use the term "Hindu Taliban" to describe the supporters of the Hindutva movement. Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize-winning Indian sociologist and cultural and political critic Ashis Nandy argued "Hindutva will be the end of Hinduism."
In Jammu and Kashmir, Since March 1990, estimates of between 250,000 to 300,000 pandits have migrated outside Kashmir due to persecution by Islamic fundamentalists in the largest case of ethnic cleansing since the partition of India. The proportion of Kashmiri Pandits in the Kashmir valley has declined from about 15% in 1947 to, by some estimates, less than 0.1% since the insurgency in Kashmir took on a religious and sectarian flavor. Many Kashmiri Pandits have been killed by Islamist terrorists in incidents such as the Wandhama massacre and the 2000 Amarnath pilgrimage massacre.
In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in violent attacks on Christians in India, often perpetrated by Hindu Nationalists. The acts of violence include arson of churches, re-conversion of Christians to Hinduism, distribution of threatening literature, burning of Bibles, raping of nuns, murder of Christian priests and destruction of Christian schools, colleges, and cemeteries. The Sangh Parivar and related organisations have stated that the violence is an expression of "spontaneous anger" of "vanvasis" against "forcible conversion" activities undertaken by missionaries, a claim described as "absurd" and rejected by scholars. Between 1964 and 1996, thirty-eight incidents of violence against Christians were reported. In 1997, twenty-four such incidents were reported. In 2007 and 2008 there was a further flare up of tensions in Orissa, the first following the Christians' putting up a Pandhal in land traditionally used by Hindus and the second after the unprovoked murder of a Hindu Guru and four of his disciples while observing Janmashtami puja. This was followed by an attack on a 150-year-old church in Madhya Pradesh, and more attacks in Karnataka,
Terrorism.
The regions with long term terrorist activities today are Jammu and Kashmir, Central India (Naxalism) and Seven Sister States (independence and autonomy movements). In the past, the Punjab insurgency led to militant activities in the Indian state of Punjab as well as the national capital Delhi (Delhi serial blasts, anti-Sikh riots). As of 2006, at least 232 of the country’s 608 districts were afflicted, at differing intensities, by various insurgent and terrorist movements.
Terrorism in India has often been alleged to be sponsored by Pakistan. After most acts of terrorism in India, many journalists and politicians accuse Pakistan's intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence of playing a role.
Naxalism.
Naxalism is an informal name given to communist groups that were born out of the Sino-Soviet split in the Indian communist movement. Ideologically they belong to various trends of Maoism. Initially the movement had its centre in West Bengal. In recent years, they have spread into less developed areas of rural central and eastern India, such as Chattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh through the activities of underground groups like the Communist Party of India (Maoist).
The CPI (Maoist) and some other Naxal factions are considered terrorists by the Government of India and various state governments in India.
Caste related violence.
Over the years, various incidents of violence against Dalits, such as Kherlanji Massacre have been reported from many parts of India. At the same time, many violent protests by Dalits, such as the 2006 Dalit protests in Maharashtra, have been reported as well. Caste related violence has also been blamed by experts such as MIT systems scientist Dr. VA Shiva Ayyadurai for the for holding back innovation and scientific research in India, making it difficult to sustain progress while regressive social organization prevails.
The Mandal Commission was established in 1979 to "identify the socially or educationally backward", and to consider the question of seat reservations and quotas for people to redress caste discrimination. In 1980, the commission's report affirmed the affirmative action practice under Indian law whereby members of lower castes were given exclusive access to a certain portion of government jobs and slots in public universities. When V. P. Singh Government tried to implement the recommendations of Mandal Commission in 1989, massive protests were held in the country. Many alleged that the politicians were trying to cash in on caste-based reservations for purely pragmatic electoral purposes.
In 1990s, many parties Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Samajwadi Party and the Janata Dal started claiming that they are representing the backward castes. Many such parties, relying primarily on Backward Classes' support, often in alliance with Dalits and Muslims, rose to power in Indian states. At the same time, many Dalit leaders and intellectuals started realizing that the main Dalit oppressors were so-called Other Backward Classes, and formed their own parties, such as the Indian Justice Party. The Congress (I) in Maharashtra long relied on OBCs' backing for its political success. Bharatiya Janata Party has also showcased its Dalit and OBC leaders to prove that it is not an upper-caste party. Bangaru Laxman, the former BJP president (2001–2002) was a Dalit. "Sanyasin" Uma Bharati, former CM of Madhya Pradesh, who belongs to OBC caste, was a former BJP leader. In 2006 Arjun Singh cabinet minister for MHRD of the UPA government was accused of playing caste politics when he introduced reservations for OBCs in educational institutions all around.

Kedron Grange Football Club

Kedron Australian Football Club is an Australian rules football club which competes in the SEQAFL Div 2
History.
The Kedron Football Club was formed in 1937 by past pupils of Kedron and Wooloowin State Schools and debuted in the QANFL that year. Although nicknamed the Redlegs, their official emblem was the Lion and the club wore sky blue and red as their colors, however in 1982 they adopted the royal blue and red guernsey as worn by Melbourne Football Club. In both 1939 and 1940 they reached the Grand Final, losing to Windsor on each occasion. They made the Grand Final for the third successive year in 1941 and this time claimed their maiden premiership with a win over Mayne. Kedron, who won back to back premierships in 1943/44 and appeared in every Grand Final from 1946 to 1950, established themselves as Queensland's strongest club in the 1940s. In each of those premiership deciders, Kedron took on Windsor and came out on top in 1946 and 1948. After claiming another premiership in 1959, Kedron suffered a drought until 1980 when they beat Coorparoo by 48 points to win the Grand Final.
Kedron Grange.
Kedron Grange Football Club were an Australian rules football club which competed in the Queensland Australian Football League. They were formed out of a merger in 1990 from the Kedron Football Club and Wilston Grange Football Club.
Wilston Grange, who had been formed in 1943, entered the QANFL in 1950. They also wore royal blue and red but also donned white. The Gorillas, as they were known, would make five Grand Finals during their time in the league for premierships in 1955, 1969 and 1972. Their 1969 premiership was remarkable in that they had finished with the wooden spoon the previous season and won the Grand Final by a record 84 points, defeating Sandgate.
At the end of the 1989 season, Kedron and Wilston Grange merged to form the Kedron Grange Football Club. The club played for seven seasons in this form, losing the 1994 Grand Final to Morningside by two points.
At the end of 1996 the merged club had collapsed, both parties to the merger relied on their junior clubs to continue in the underage competitions
Solo again.
By 2007 enough support from the juniors allowed the senior club to return to open age football via the Queensland State Association division two. They won the flag that year and were runners up in 2010.
Promoted to division one in 2011 and now due to a reorganization they will compete in the SEQAFL Division Two in 2012.
Wilston Grange still exist as a division one club in the of the SEQAFL Division One, playing their home games at Hickey Park.

New England Female Medical College

New England Female Medical College, originally Boston Female Medical College, was founded in 1848 by Samuel Gregory and was the first school to medically train women. It merged with Boston University School of Medicine in 1873.
History.
Women such as Harriot Kezia Hunt had served as family physicians, but women were denied attendance at medical lectures and examinations. In 1847, Elizabeth Blackwell was the first woman to enroll in a United States medical school when she entered the Geneva Medical College. She graduated in 1850 and went on to found the Women’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary.
Founder Samuel Gregory believed it was unseemly for male physicians to assist women during childbirth, and (although that view was controversial) was able to gain support for the establishment of the first female medical college with help from Lemuel Shattuck and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Israel Tilsdale Talbot also helped start the school.
Rebecca Lee Crumpler graduated from the New England Female Medical College in 1864 and was the first African-American to earn a medical degree. Mary Harris Thompson also graduated and went on to establish the Chicago Hospital for Women and Children. Dr. Esther Hawks was also a graduate. In 1870 the New England Female Medical College building was dedicated on a lot between East Concord and Stoughton Streets, giving the school its own home after 22 years of existence. The school trained over 280 students and granted 98 medical degrees. 
Arabs supplied medical instruction for women and the School of Salerno may have afforded training for Trotula.

Rihand Dam () is a concrete gravity dam located at Pipri in Sonbhadra District in Uttar Pradesh, India. Its reservoir area is on the border of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This reservoir is known as Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar. It is on the Rihand River which is the tributary of the Son River. The catchment area of this dam is spread in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh whereas it supplies irrigation water in Bihar located in the downstream of the river.
Specifications.
Rihand dam is a concrete gravity dam with a length of 934.21 m. The maximum height of the dam is 91.44 m and was constructed during period 1954-62. The dam comprises 61 independent blocks and ground joints. The powerhouse is situated at the toe of the dam, with installed capacity of 300 MW (6 units of 50 MW each). The Intake Structure is situated between blocks no. 28 to 33. The Dam is in distress condition. It is proposed to carry out the rehabilitation works in the dam and the powerhouse. The F.R.L. of the dam is 268.22 m and it impounds 8.6 Million Acreft of water. It is one of the biggest reservoir by its gross storage capacity in India but sufficient water is not flowing in to the reservoir. 
Many super thermal power stations are located in the catchment area of the dam. These are Singrauli, Vindyachal, Rihand, Anpara & Sasan super thermal power stations and Renukoot thermal station. The high alkalinity run off water from the ash dumps (some are located in the reservoir area) of these coal fired power stations ultimately collects in this reservoir enhancing its water alkalinity and pH. Using high alkalinity water for irrigation converts the agriculture fields in to fallow Alkali soils.
The construction of the dam resulted in forced relocation of nearly 100,000 people

Operation MB8

Operation MB8 was a British Royal Navy operation in the Mediterranean Sea during 4–11 November 1940. It was made up of six forces—totalling two aircraft carriers, five battleships, 10 cruisers, and 30 destroyers, including much of Force H—protecting four distinct supply convoys.
It consisted of several phases: Operation Coat, Operation Crack, Convoy MW 3, Convoy ME 3, Convoy AN 6, and the main element, "Operation Judgement".
Operation Coat.
Operation Coat was a reinforcement convoy from Britain to Malta, carrying troops and anti-aircraft guns. The convoy was made up of the battleship , heavy cruisers and , and three escorting destroyers. It was covered by the aircraft carrier , light cruiser , and three more destroyers, all from Force H, out to mid-Mediterranean; three Force H destroyers would remain, the rest turning back from Sicily.
Convoy MW 3.
Convoy MW 3 was made up of five merchantmen bound for Malta from Alexandria, plus two more providing supplies to the base at Suda Bay. The convoy was escorted by the anti-aircraft cruiser , accompanied by three destroyers.
Convoy ME 3.
Convoy ME 3 comprised four merchantmen sailing in ballast from Malta to Alexandria, under escort of the battleship , "Coventry", and two destroyers.
Convoy AN 6.
Convoy AN 6 consisted of four slow tankers bound for Greece from Egypt, in support of the British expedition there, escorted by a slow trawler.
Shaping a similar course were reinforcements for Crete, embarked in light cruisers and as Force B, while light cruiser (Vice Admiral H. D. Pridham-Wippell's Force C) transported RAF supplies to Greece and inspected Suda Bay. All three would rejoin to form Force X for an 11/12 November raid on the Otranto Strait.
Operation Crack.
Operation Crack was an attack on Cagliari by aircraft from "Ark Royal", "en route" to Malta, branching off from Operation Coat.
Operation Judgement.
Operation Judgement—under the overall command of Admiral A. B. Cunningham—was executed by aircraft from the carrier , escorted by battleships "Ramilies", , , and . They met the heavy cruisers and and three destroyers, then escorting Convoy MW 3, and provided cover. Then the "Barham" group from Operation Coat was to be met, with "Illustrious", "Gloucester", "York", and "Berwick" detaching to attack Taranto, coincident with the Force X raid.
The Italians were aware of sorties from Alexandria and Gibraltar by 7 November, and sent nine submarines to attack a Malta convoy (MW 3) detected on 8 November. Bombers (unsurprisingly) failed even to pinpoint the Judgement force, and when Force H was detected headed back toward Gibraltar on 9 November, the Italians presumed MW 3 had turned around, too.
Italian confusion arose when "Barham", "Berwick", "Glasgow", and their destroyers were detected 10 November off Lemnos. The correct deduction—they had detached from the Gibraltar-bound force—was not accompanied by a correct guess they would join with Cunningham. The same day, "Ramillies", "Coventry", and two destroyers protecting ME 3 were detected, and again, bombers failed even to locate them.
The very complexity of Operation MB8, with its various forces and convoys, succeeded in deceiving the Italians into thinking only normal convoying was underway. (Its success stands in stark contrast to complex Japanese failures at Coral Sea and Midway.) While Italian reconnaissance was characteristically bad, in the end, the Italians had only failed to keep track of "Illustrious". That the Italians expected the British to behave in what was, at the time, their usual way was the root of the mistake.

Thanasis Kaproulias

Thanasis Kaproulias is an audio artist who creates noise music under the name of Novi_sad.
Life and work.
Thanasis Kaproulias was born in Greece in 1980. He graduated from the Economic University of Piraues and lives and works in Athens, Greece. 
Thanasis Kaproulias (as "Novi_sad") has worked and collaborated with: Helge Sten (Deathprod, Supersilent), Francisco López, Mika Vainio (Pan Sonic), B. J. Nilsen, Daniel Menche, Zbigniew Karkowski, Richard Chartier, Carl Michael von Hausswolff, Jacob Kirkegaard, Beckie Foon and Scott Konzelmann.
Influenced by the pioneers of audio assault, he began generating sounds in 2005. In his works, amplified environmental recordings, drone manipulations, structured ambient soundscapes, microtones vs overtones, all come together in a hyperstructure of iconoclastic form. 
Novi_sad’s artistic output displays a high level of technical ability, as well as a sensitivity to the nuances of location. Every sound that occurs is treated with a sculptural integrity and his sonic power operates on a level in which the audience participates as transcendental listeners. 
His approach is similar to the 'cinema pour l'oreille' (cinema for the ear) and in turn would like to ‘donner à voir’ (lead to seeing) by means of sound. Being immersed in his sonic environment offers an absolutely visceral and cerebral experience at once. 
Novi_sad explores sound as sensation pulling apart its physical properties to reveal its relationship with human perception. Some of his projects are primarily focused in architectural acoustics and the relationship between architecture and sound, when other projects are based on various methods of audio analysis in extremely unique recordings and the use of quantitative and numerical data from different sources. 
Thanasis Kaproulias is published by Touch Music.
Novi_sad’s albums are available from Sedimental Touch [U.K and Staalplaat He has performed his work live in cinemas, industrial spaces, theatres, churches, museums, galleries, squats, in festivals like Mutek [Montreal, Canada, Ultrahung Hungary, Observatori Spain, Gaudeamus Musis Week The Netherlands, Field recordings festival Germany, Suoni per il popolo Canada, Full-Pull, Sweden, and in such spaces as VPRO National Radio The Netherlands, Diapason Gallery York, U.S.A, Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts Denmark, Muziekgebouw aan ‘t IJ The Netherlands, Fylkingen Sweden, The Chapel U.S.A.

Jean Samuel Pauly

Jean Samuel Pauly (April 13, 1766 – 1821), he was born as Samuel Johann Pauli, was a famous gunsmith of the early 19th century. Pauly was born at Vechigen near Bern, Switzerland on 13 April 1766.
Career.
In 1798, at 32, Pauly became an Artillery sergeant. He fought as a member of the Swiss Army, together with the French, under Masséna. During his campaigns, in 1799, Pauly wrote a manual about the usage of firearms.
Pauly moved to Paris in 1802 where he worked on designing an airship and maintained contact with the weapon manufacturer of Saint-Étienne. In 1804 he designed an automatic bridge. Pauly used for himself the title "Colonel Jean Samuel Pauly". He established a gunsmith worshop where he developed mercury fulminate platina. In 1809 he employed the German Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse who would later become the inventor of the famous Dreyse rifle.
Self-contained cartridge.
In Paris in 1808, in association with French gunsmith François Prélat, Pauly created the first fully self-contained cartridges: primer powder (the major innovation of Pauly), a paper casing and a round bullet. The cartridge was loaded through the breech and fired with a needle or a pin. The needle-activated central-fire breech-loading gun would become a major feature of firearms thereafter. The corresponding firearm was also developed by Pauly. Pauly made an improved version which was protected by a patent on 29 September 1812. The cartridge was further improved by the French gunsmith Casimir Lefaucheux in 1836.
Upon the fall of Paris to the allies on 5 April 1814, von Dreyse left for Prussia and Pauly left for London, where he continued developing various weapons under the sponsorship of Durs Egg.

Swoon's Son (1953–1977) is an American Hall of Fame Thoroughbred racehorse. Foaled February 13, 1953 in Lexington, Kentucky, he was bred and raced by E. Gay Drake, owner of Lexington's Mineola Stock Farm and a charter member of the Thoroughbred Club of America.
Ridden by jockey David Erb in all but one of his twenty-two stakes race wins, Swoon's Son set track records at sprint distances at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington and at Chicago's Arlington Park plus at distances of around one mile on both turf and dirt at Chicago's Washington Park Race Track and the Hawthorne Race Course. He raced for four years from 1955 through 1958 before being retired to stud duty at Mineola Stock Farm in January 1959. Of his offspring, the most famous is the filly Chris Evert who too would become a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee.
Swoon's Son died at Mineola Stock Farm in 1977 and is buried there in the farm's equine cemetery. In 2007, his racing career was honored with induction in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Glens Fork, Kentucky

Glens Fork is an unincorporated community in Adair County, Kentucky, United States. Its elevation is 810 feet (247 m).
History.
This community has been variously known as Glens Fork, Glenville or Glennville, and Hardscratch.
Glens Fork is located in a region of limestone, so the land is perforated by many sinkholes and small caves. Most of the area is a karst landscape, where there is no direct drainage into any streams, but instead the rainfall goes directly into sinkholes. There are several undeveloped caves in the area, including the Helms Caves which contained American Indian artifacts.
It is unclear when the first settlers came to Glens Fork, but the first deed at the Adair County courthouse dates from June 29, 1802. Glens Fork was apparently named for an early land owner by the name of Glen, but almost nothing is known about him. Another possibility is that Glens Fork was named for David Glenn, who was a hunter employed by George Rogers Clark. The post office was established on September 2, 1857, and discontinued on July 31, 1863, because of the American Civil War. The post office was re-established on October 10, 1865, and has been in continuous operation since then. The name "Hardscratch" may refer to a Civil War campsite where living was hard. 
On March 25, 1872, the town of Glenville was established by an act of the Kentucky General Assembly. The town boundaries were established as one-quarter of a mile in every direction from the northeast corner of the Masonic Hall, which was established as the center of town.

Effects of Hurricane Ivan in Jamaica

The effects of Hurricane Ivan in Jamaica were among the worst from a tropical cyclone in the island's recorded history. Hurricane Ivan formed as a Cape Verde-type hurricane in early September 2004 and became the ninth named storm, the sixth hurricane, and the fourth major hurricane of the year. Ivan reached Category 5 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the strongest possible category. Ivan became the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record. In Jamaica, the storm caused severe damage which left 18,000 people homeless. An estimated 17 people on the island were killed by Ivan.
Preparations.
On September 12, 2004, a hurricane watch was issued for the island. The next day, that advisory was upgraded to a hurricane warning, as hurricane conditions had become more imminent. By 1500 UTC on September 12, all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued for Jamaica. About 500,000 Jamaicans were told to evacuate from coastal areas, P.J. Patterson, Prime Minister, declared a public emergency. According to Patterson, the island had to "prepare for the worst-case scenario". Schools and churches were converted into shelters, and the national blood bank requested residents to donate blood, in anticipation of potential injuries. By September 10, over 1,000 individual shelters were set up throughout the country. The Jamaican Government urged off-duty corrections officers to report to work. Air Jamaica canceled all flights to and from the island, as well as inter-island flights; aircraft were transported to the United States until the storm passed. The Mennonite Central Committee designated the equivalence of $20,000 USD for assisting with potential damage. Businesses in Kingston were closed, and fishermen secured their boats to trees. Workers boarded up windows, and grocery stores remained open later than normal to allow for residents to purchase supplies.
Impact.
On September 11 and September 12, the center of Ivan passed near Jamaica. High winds and heavy rainfall affected the island, causing significant wind and flood damage. The storm was described as one of the most intense hurricanes in Jamaica's recorded history. Rainfall exceeded in some places. At Ritchies, 28.37 in (720.8 mm) of rain was reported, and 27.92 in (709.4 mm) fell at Mavis Bank. In southern parishes, rainfall data was were lost due to damage to rain gauges. Doppler radar velocity data estimated that winds of affected the island. Pedro Bank, to the southwest of Jamaica, reported a 10-minute average wind of . Ivan caused severe damage, damaging and destroying houses, and triggering mudslides that washed out roads. In Kingston, the winds downed trees and poles and caused flooding. In Montego Bay, the Barnett River overflowed its banks; businesses were flooded with up to of water. Roads suffered flooding, and part of the A1 Road, the primary northern coastal highway, was washed away. Along the coast, were reported, and in Kingston, several large trees were brought down. Tiles on the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel were blown off and broken, and waves flooded a causeway to an airport near Kingston that was closed and evacuated.
Due to a shift Ivan's track, the capital city of Kingston was spared from extreme damage. However, flooding in the city was deemed a "major catastrophe". Some roads throughout the region were left impassible due to downed trees and utility poles. The majority of tourism and resort areas suffered "mainly cosmetic damage and all structures remained primarily intact". In the aftermath of the storm, looters were reported roaming the streets of Jamaica's capital city, Kingston, robbing emergency workers at gunpoint. Overall, 17 people were killed in Jamaica and 18,000 people were left homeless as a result of the flood waters and high winds. Damage on the island totaled US$360 million (2004 USD).

Structure of the Pakistan Army

The Structure of the Pakistan Army can be broken down two ways, administrative, and operational. Operationally the Pakistan Army is divided in 11 Corps having areas of responsibility (AOR) from mountainous regions of northern Pakistan to the desert and coastal regions of the south. Administratively it is divided in different regiments (details below). The General Headquarter (GHQ) of Pakistan Army is located in the garrison city of Rawalpindi in Punjab province. It is planned to be moved to the capital city of Islamabad.
Army headquarters and staff.
The Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), formerly called the Commander in Chief (C in C), is challenged with the responsibility of commanding the Pakistani Army. The COAS operates from army headquarters in Rawalpindi, near Islamabad. The Principal Staff Officers (PSO's) assisting him in his duties at the Lieutenant General level include:
The Military Operations and Intelligence Directorates function under the Chief of General Staff (CGS). A major reorganization in GHQ was done in September 2008 under General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, when two new PSO positions were introduced: the Inspector General Arms and the Inspector General Communications and IT, thus raising the number of PSO's to eight.
The headquarters function also includes the Judge Advocate General (JAG), and the Comptroller of Civilian Personnel, the Chief of the Corps of Engineers (E-in-C) who is also head of Military Engineering Service (MES), all of them also report to the Chief of the Army Staff.
Operational structure.
Corps.
There are 11 Corps located at various garrisons all over Pakistan.

Iorrie Isaacs

Iorwerth Isaac commonly known as Iorrie Isaacs (12 October 1911 – 25 April 1966) was a Welsh dual-code international rugby flanker who played international rugby for Wales. At club level he played rugby union for Pontypridd, Cardiff and later rugby league for Wales, and Leeds.
Rugby career.
Isaacs was first selected for Wales in their opening game of the 1933 Home Nations Championship. The match was against England at their national stadium, Twickenham. Wales had failed to win at the ground in their first nine attempts, and the Welsh failure at the ground was known as the 'Twickenham bogey'. Isaacs was placed at open-side flanker, opposite the veteran Tom Arthur who was positioned on the blind side. In an exciting match Isaacs, along with Turnbull and Arthur, continually spoiled the English scrum. When Isaacs caused the English half-backs to loose the loose maul, Watcyn Thomas heeled the ball back for Wooller and then Davey to feed Ronnie Boon who scored a Welsh try. The game ended 7-3, with all the Welsh points scored by Boon, who had also placed a drop goal. Isaacs played just one more international game in the very next match of the Home Nations Championship against Scotland at St Helens, his international career identical to that of Raymond Bark-Jones.
At the start of the 1933/34 season Isaacs left rugby union behind when he 'Went North' switching to the professional rugby league game, joining Leeds RLFC.

Klahowya (sternwheeler)

Klahowya was a sternwheel steamer that operated in British Columbia on the Columbia River from 1910 to 1915. The name "Klahowya" is the standard greeting in the Chinook Jargon.
Design and construction.
"Klahowya" was built at Golden, BC."Klahowya" 's engines came from "Isabella McCormack" which had been converted into a houseboat. "Klahowya" was built by Capt. Frank P. Armstrong (another source gives George Rury as the builder), with the capacity to carry 100 passengers. Armstrong built "Klahowya" in an unusual way. When the Columbia River was frozen, Armstrong built the vessel on a set of shipways constructed directly on the ice. When the boat was finished, Armstrong cut around the outline of the vessel in the ice, and the boat settled into the water.
Two sources state "Klahowya" was built for the Columbia River Lumber Company, while another source states "Klahowya" was intended for the increasing tourist trade in the Golden region. Multiple use steamboats were common, and use for lumbering would not have been necessarily inconsistent with tourist applications.
Operations.
"Klahowya" operated on the Columbia River from Golden to Columbia Lake. The period of reported operations was brief, from 1910 to 1915. 
It is possible that Canada's participation in World War I starting in 1914 helped shorten "Klahowya"'s career. A number of steamboats in other areas of inland British Columbia had been built to cater to tourism, which was badly affected by war. Mobilization of men also depressed local businesses such as lumbering, which depended upon their labor. Captain Armstrong himself went overseas during World War I to supervise steamboat operations in war zones in the Middle East.
Removal from service.
"Klahowya" is reported to have been withdrawn from service in 1915.

CompassionArt (album)

CompassionArt is a studio album by the songwriters' charity of the same name. It features the entire CompassionArt song writing team, Paul Baloche, Chris Tomlin, Tim Hughes, Matt Redman, Darlene Zschech, Israel Houghton, Michael W. Smith, Graham Kendrick, Andy Park, Steven Curtis Chapman, Stu Garrard and charity co-founder Martin Smith, along with several other collaborators. All proceeds from the recording will directly benefit charities of the song writers' choosing.
Writing.
Delirious? singer Martin Smith founded the CompassionArt charity with his wife, Anna Smith, after being moved by the poverty suffered by people in many of the countries he had visited on tour. The final Delirious? album "Kingdom of Comfort" was heavily influenced by these experiences. In early 2008, he invited the newly formed CompassionArt team, made up of CCM artists from around the world, to Scotland for a writing retreat. During this time the group wrote twenty two songs, fourteen of which made their way onto the album. All the artists attended the retreat apart from Chris Tomlin, who was unwell.
Recording.
The majority of the album was recorded around February 2008 at Abbey Road studios in London. Chris Tomlin joined the writing team, along with additional contributors Amy Grant, Kirk Franklin, tobyMac, CeCe Winans, Ana Paula Valadão, Leeland Mooring, Joel Houston and Christy Nockels. A couple of musicians were unable to travel to the United Kingdom for the recording, although their contributions were recorded in other studios around the world. Martin Smith also travelled to Uganda in order to visit the Watoto Children's Choir and record their contribution to the album. One of the songs which was recorded was "Fill My Cup." This had previously been written by Delirious? as a potential song for inclusion on "Kingdom Of Comfort", although it was never released.
Singles.
In April 2008, "So Great" was released internationally on iTunes as a single. It was also performed live at that year's Dove Awards by Michael W. Smith, Israel Houghton, Paul Baloche, Chris Tomlin and Christy Nockels. The song was also included on the compilation album "WOW Hits 1".
"King of Wonders" was released to Christian radio in November 2008.
Release.
The album was released internationally in November 2008, although release was delayed until January 2009 in North America to avoid clashing with new albums from Michael W. Smith and Chris Tomlin. The album also includes a documentary DVD, and was released alongside a book, "The Art of Compassion", written by the song writing team.
Some of the songs were available for free download, although a donation was requested.
Awards.
In 2010, the album was nominated for a Dove Award for Special Event Album of the Year at the 41st GMA Dove Awards.

<doc id="20138495" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20138495" title="Sneath Glass Company">
Sneath Glass Company

The Sneath Glass Company was an American manufacturer of glass and glassware. After a brief 1890s startup in Tiffin, Ohio, the Company moved to Hartford City, Indiana, to take advantage of the Indiana Gas Boom. The small city was enjoying the benefits of the Indiana Gas Boom, and could provide natural gas as an energy source for manufacturers. Sneath Glass was one of many glass manufacturers that moved to the region, and became Hartford City’s second largest employer.
Among the original owners, Ohio businessman Ralph Davis Sneath provided capital and financial knowledge—and his family is the company’s namesake. Sneath was president of the firm when it moved to Indiana. Henry Crimmel, who already had over 25 years of glassmaking experience when he joined the company, provided the manufacturing expertise after the firm's reorganization. Following the reorganization, Alva Clyde Crimmel (Henry’s son) was the firm's secretary, while John W. Geiger served as treasurer. These four members of the management team were the company’s owners when it moved to Indiana. 
In Indiana, the company’s main products were initially lantern globes and founts (which held the lantern’s fuel), and railroads were its major customers. As demand for lanterns declined during the beginning of the 20th Century, Sneath evolved to be a maker of glassware for portable kitchen cabinets, such as those made by Sellers and the Hoosier Manufacturing Company. Eventually, portable kitchen cabinets lost their popularity after new houses began utilizing built-in cabinetry. Sneath transitioned to be a maker of a new group of wares—glass products for refrigerators. While lanterns, kitchenware, and refrigerator products were the major goods manufactured by the company during its existence, it also made a wide variety of additional merchandise. Aquariums, lenses, and mailboxes were also among the glass products made by the company. Sneath was also an early manufacturer of heat-proof glass.
After World War II, Sneath’s major products began to become obsolete because of the plastics industry. Unlike earlier in the century, the company did not transition to a new major product when demand for its portfolio of manufactured goods subsided. Management did not adapt to competition from the plastics industry, faced a shrinking market for its goods, and could not raise prices due to post-war government price controls. The factory closed in 1952 after a work stoppage led by the local labor unions.
Early years.
The Tiffin Glass Company was established in 1889 in Tiffin, Ohio. On January 22, 1892, the company was purchased by Samuel B. Sneath, Ralph D. Sneath, and John. W. Geiger—and renamed Sneath Glass Company. Production began in February, and major products were lantern globes and tumblers. After a reorganization and the destruction of its Tiffin works by fire, the company was lured to Hartford City, Indiana. Located in East Central Indiana, Hartford City offered free natural gas and land. The East Central Indiana area was enjoying an economic “boom” period at that time caused by the discovery of natural gas. The first Sneath Glass plant in Hartford City was located on the north side of town. Production began in September 1894, and the company already had orders for 6 months of work on the first day of operation.
Following the company’s reorganization, the firm’s officers were Ralph Davis Sneath, president; John. W. Geiger, treasurer; Alvie Clyde Crimmel, secretary; and Henry Crimmel, plant manager. These four men were also the owners of the company, each owning equal shares of its stock. The board of directors consisted of the four owners plus Ralph's father, Samuel B. Sneath. The Sneaths came from a family of prominent businessmen from Tiffin, Ohio, and the Crimmels came from a family of glassmakers. Ralph Sneath also became involved in a grain dealership, railroading, and banking. He eventually became president of the Commercial National Bank of Tiffin, Ohio, and also president of the Ohio Banker’s Association.
Civil War veteran Henry Crimmel brought over 25 years of glass making experience to the company, having learned and sharpened his skills in Bellaire, Fostoria, and Tiffin, Ohio. Henry’s brothers, Johannes (a.k.a. John) and Jacob, worked in glassmaking—and Jacob also helped found the American Flint Glass Workers Union. Both Henry and Jacob Crimmel were considered key craftsmen in the early days of the Fostoria Glass Company. While the Sneaths remained in Tiffin to oversee their many business interests, the Crimmels and Tiffin businessman J. W. Geiger moved to Hartford City.
Originally, Sneath Glass made kerosene lantern globes and the founts that held the lantern's fuel. Ruby, green, and blue globes were a specialty. At one time, Sneath Glass was one of only three factories in the United States that made copper ruby globes. Major customers of lantern globes were railroads and ships. Sneath globes were also used during the construction of the Panama Canal.
By 1897, the company had over 60 employees. Although plant manager Henry Crimmel was known for his craftsmanship, he was also mechanically inclined. The Sneath plant had a unique system of air hoses that would allow glass blowers to quickly finish glassware that was started without the aid of machinery, enabling the skilled workers to achieve a much higher production rate. Henry Crimmel received a patent in 1904 for a “Glass Drawing Machine” that was an improvement for glass blowing and prevented irregularities in the glass.
In 1905, Sneath Glass moved to the Jones plant of the American Window Glass Company, located on Wabash Avenue in the west side of Hartford City. The Wabash Avenue site had direct access to a railroad, and was close to Washington Street, which eventually became part of Indiana State Road 26, now the major east-west highway through the city. The Jones plant was quickly remodeled, and both operations and headquarters were moved to that site. This location became the permanent home of Sneath Glass Company.
John W. Geiger, part of the original company ownership and management, retired in 1907 and moved back to Tiffin, Ohio. He died at his home in Tiffin on June 23, 1915, at the age of 74 years. Another original investor, Samuel B. Sneath, died earlier in the same (1915) year, on January 7.
Transition from globes to other products.
By 1899, the company was listed as the only manufacturer of semaphore globes and bulls eye lenses. However, the company was diversifying from its lighting products portfolio with fruit jars and glassware. Three sizes of Mason jars were being hand blown by 1908. The Sneath jars were said to be "superior and more durable than machine made jars." Around the same time, the company began making glass canisters for kitchen cabinet companies, including the Hoosier cabinet made by Hoosier Manufacturing Company. This began the gradual (but important) transition from manufacturer of globes to manufacturer of glass products for portable kitchen cabinets. Cabinet products included salt and sugar bins, spice jars, and coffee and tea jars. From 1914 to 1916, management patented dispensing caps, a dispensing jar, and a bracket for supporting dispensing bins used in kitchen cabinets. 
Henry Crimmel suffered a stroke in 1916, and died about one year later. Henry's son (and company co-founder) Alva Clyde (a.k.a. Alvie or Clyde) Crimmel took more management responsibilities at that time, and by 1920 his title was Vice-President and Treasurer. Clyde’s oldest son, Henry Hays Crimmel, joined the company’s management in 1918, focusing on sales. Henry Hays had been working at Sneath since he was a child, and was very familiar with the company's products. Child labor was common in glass factories during the 19th century and early 20th century. The elder Henry Crimmel was fined $11.95 in 1901 by the state of Indiana for employing children under the age of 14.
The company used its experience with lighting and lenses to assist the United States government during World War I. Almost 10 percent of Sneath's production was devoted to a contract with the United States Navy to manufacture signal and masthead lights. Red, green, and white lights were produced for Navy ships.
By 1918, the company's products (in addition to the lenses and lamps) were lantern globes, colored and crystal specialties, and food preservation ware such as canisters and fruit jars. Around 1920, the company began making an interesting (but less important) product—a wall-mounted mail box. These mailboxes were made of glass, enabling one to easily see if mail had been delivered. Sneath employee William Chapman, working under the supervision of Ray Pruden, was granted a patent for the glass mailbox in 1921. Ray Pruden was superintendent of the factory, assuming that title after Henry Crimmel’s stroke. William Chapman was a well-known glass blower who also secured a patent for an ash tray. Employees of the company also patented other products, including a drawer pull, a caster for furniture, a newspaper receptacle, and a chick feeding fount. Years later, the glass mailbox was shown in "Popular Mechanics" magazine. 
Sneath Glass continued making glassware for kitchen cabinet manufacturers such as Hoosier and Sellers, and the 1920s were peak years for that cabinet style. Sneath management also patented more of its products used in kitchen cabinets, such as a sugar bin and a holder for condiment jars. 
The Great Depression and World War II.
In 1930, management consisted of Ralph D. Sneath, president; Alvie Clyde Crimmel, vice president; Henry Hays Crimmel, treasurer and general manager; Harry C. Hill, secretary and sales manager; and Ray Pruden, factory manager. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Sneath kept much of its workforce employed by shortening shifts. This kept the company from losing its skilled workers, and enabled more people to be employed. The glass business was thought to have one advantage during difficult economic times: people purchased glass products rather than metal products. 
Like the company's transition from lantern globes to glassware for kitchen cabinets, the transition to refrigerator products was important for the company's survival. By the mid-1930s, the Hoosier style cabinets, many of which contained glassware made by Sneath Glass, had lost their popularity. New houses typically contained built-in cabinetry. 
Although the company had transitioned to refrigerator products as a focal point, it still made other merchandise. One product was the company's own version of borosilicate glass, which was called "heat proof" glass. This glass could be moved from a refrigerator to an oven without breaking from the extreme temperature change. Heat proof glass was used for ovenware and coffee makers—and during World War II, it was used in searchlight products. Unfortunately, the Sneath version of borosilicate glass, like the Sneath brand, was not promoted. 
In 1940, millionaire Ralph Sneath died shortly after receiving severe injuries in an automobile accident,
and the last of the founders, Alvie Clyde Crimmel, became chief executive. Although Sneath did not spend much time at the glass plant, he was well liked and watched the company finances. Despite this loss, an aging workforce, and an aging infrastructure, the company continued to have talent both in the manufacturing process and creatively. Employee James A. Lewis received three patents related to glassmaking during the early 1940s, and master glass blower Bill Claytor was well known in the industry. Mr. Claytor became renowned in Hartford City because of the hand-blown Christmas gifts he made from a small furnace in the garage of his home.
During World War II, the company made water-tight globes and lenses for search lights. Additional consumer products included glass irons, skillets, and even kitchen sinks. The 1946 management team was A. C. Crimmel president; Henry Hays Crimmel, Vice President; H.C. Hill, Secretary and Sales Manager; S.B. Sneath Jr., Treasurer; John Richard Crimmel, Assistant Treasurer and Purchasing Agent; and Ray Pruden, Superintendent. Refrigeration products continued to be the most important segment of the product portfolio at that time.
The end of Sneath Glass.
During 1952, the nation had a system of price controls that attempted to control post-war inflation. Workers at the Sneath Glass plant held a strike (the first ever for Sneath Glass), demanding better wages and fringe benefits. Unfortunately, even if the competitive market would accept higher prices for Sneath glassware, the nation’s Price Stabilization Board would not allow Sneath to increase prices—
and the company was already losing money. The plant was closed, and approximately 125 families lost a source of income. The remaining company founder, A.C. Crimmel, died within two years. Ironically, Henry Crimmel helped found a company that lasted 60 years, and his brother Jacob helped found a union that contributed (along with management) to the company’s demise.
In 1953, Indiana Glass Company purchased controlling interest of the Sneath works. The Indiana Glass works was located in an adjacent county, in Dunkirk, Indiana. This acquisition enabled the company to offer

CompuBank

CompuBank, N.A. was a financial company engaged primarily in retail banking, mortgage banking, business finance and providing ATM and merchant processing services. CompuBank was founded in 1998 by banking veteran Frank Goldberg and launched on the internet in early October the same year. It was one of the pioneers of the Internet banking industry, and recognized as one of the first internet-only banks.
Headquartered in Suite in Suite 215 in 2 Greenway Plaza East, Houston, Texas, CompuBank was third internet-only bank, and the first American nationally chartered as a national bank by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency operating solely on the internet. The previous two Net-only banks, Security First Network Bank (SFNB) and NetBank (formerly Atlanta Internet Bank), used thrift charters. CompuBank offered a variety of depository products and services including: basic checking, interest checking, savings, money market accounts, certificates of deposits, visa check cards, direct deposit and transfers, free domestic wire services, online check re-order, free bill payment and free ATM services.
Compubank was launched in late 1998. After a tough start with an amateurish web site which was basically a site map plus four buttons, the bank tried to remake itself into a small business bank. However, the bank run into difficulties due to its the lack of loan products, and was acquired by NetBank in early 2001.

Reddish House

Reddish House, also known as Reddish Manor in the village of Broad Chalke in Wiltshire, England is an early 18th-century manor house possibly built in its current form for Jeremiah Cray, a clothier. It is a Grade II listed structure by English Heritage.
Whilst the history of the property can be traced to the early 16th century, the house as it currently stands appears to have been developed in the early 18th century, when owned by a series of three absentee landlords all sharing the name Jeremiah Clay. The construction and design appear to show a melange of influences of Charles II (1660–1685); William and Mary (1689–1702); and Queen Anne (1702–1714).
Chronology.
16th century.
In the early 16th century Littlecote farm was bought from John Littlecote by Sir Richard Elyot, serjeant-at-law and Attorney-General to the Queen consort, Elizabeth of York. After his death in 1522 it passed to his only son, Thomas Elyot a diplomat and author. The 50 acre farm was taken by the crown at the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it is surmised that this was because Sir Thomas Elyot had gifted it as part of an endowment to Salisbury Cathedral. In 1560 Queen Elizabeth I granted it to William Reddiche who already owned several properties in the village as a 'Free tenant' of the Earl of Pembroke in Wilton.
William Reddiche of Maiden Bradley was married to Alice Dyer, daughter of Sir James Dyer, a judge and Speaker of the House of Commons.
During the Dissolution period (circa 1530s) the farm appears to have been leased by John Penny. He died in 1555 bequeathing to his son the 80 sheep, grazing rights, sown crops and farm equipment.
17th century.
The Reddish/Reddiche family owned the estate from 1560 until 1696 but as they lived in Maiden Bradley it was inhabited by a series of lessees. These appear to include the descendants of John Penny because in 1630 a new lease was granted to John Penny.
The absentee Reddish family who owned the house and farm included Christopher Reddish (circa 1599); Edward Reddish (circa 1628); his sons William Reddish (circa 1662) and James Reddish who sold it to Jeremiah Cray.
In 1696 James Reddish sold the house and farm to Jeremiah Cray of Ibsley Hampshire, another absentee landlord who owned several estates including 'Cray's Farm' at Verwood.
18th century.
Jeremiah Cray died in 1709 (or 1710) bequeathing most of his estates to either his brother Alexander or his nephew John Cray. In 1725 John Cray passed it to his own son Jeremiah who died in 1731 and whose own son, another Jeremiah Cray (the third Jeremiah) died in 1786. During the Cray ownership Reddish had been inhabited and farmed by a series of lessees including a mercer John Coombs from 1702–1706, and George Northover for over 50 years and James Lawes.
In 1786 Jeremiah Cray's estates were shared by his two daughters, Sarah and Margaret - wives of Sir Alexander Grant, 7th Baronet and Percival Lewis respectively. In 1806 the house was sold to George Young from Horton in Dorset who became the first resident owner for 246 years.
19th century.
In 1806 Reddish house was sold to George Young who bequeathed it to his son George Bland Young in 1828 and on to George Edgar Young in 1893.
20th century.
The house was inhabited by Norah Young until 1918, and by Major C.A. Wells until 1929 when it was purchased by R.W. Williamson to amalgamate the 100 acres into the neighbouring 'Knowle farm'. In 1935 Claude Williamson sold the house and its 2.5 acre gardens to Dr. Lucius Wood and his wife Clare who lived there from 1935 until 1947, running his General Practice and dentistry. Their son, the artist Christopher Wood is buried in the village churchyard; his headstone was carved by Eric Gill.
Society photographer and artist Sir Cecil Beaton bought Reddish house in 1947 and transformed the interior. Beaton added rooms on the eastern side, extended the parlour southwards, and introduced many new fittings. Greta Garbo was a visitor. The upper floor had been equipped for illegal cock-fighting at the beginning of the 20th century but Beaton used the cages as wardrobes to store the oscar-winning costumes from his set design of My Fair Lady. He remained at the house until his death in 1980 and is buried in the churchyard.
In 1980 Ursula Henderson bought the house from the estate of Cecil Beaton and lived there until 1987 when she moved to the neighbouring village of Bishopstone before her death in 1989. She was born Ursula von Pannwitz and was once styled Countess of Chichester from her first marriage to John Buxton Pelham, 8th Earl of Chichester who died on active service in 1944.
The house was owned and extensively renovated by musicians Robert Fripp and Toyah Willcox from December 1987 until July 1999.
An exhibition Cecil Beaton at Home: Ashcombe House & Reddish will be on view at The Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum from May until September 2014

<doc id="20138633" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20138633" title="Kahayan River">
Kahayan River

The Kahayan river, or Great Dyak, is the largest river in Central Kalimantan, a province of Indonesia in Kalimantan - the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo. The provincial capital Palangkaraya lies on the river. The main inhabitants are Dyaks, who practice slash-and-burn rice cultivation and pan for gold on the upper reaches. The lower Kayahan flows through a rich and unusual environment of peat swamp forests, which has been severely degraded by an unsuccessful program to convert a large part of the area into rice paddies, compounded by legal and illegal forestry.
Geography.
Central Kalimantan covers 153,800 km2, with 82% tropical rain forest and no more than 3% agricultural land. The northern part of the province is mountainous, the central area has flat and fertile tropical forests and the southern area is swampy. The forests provide rattan, resin and high-quality woods. The climate is hot and humid, typically around 30° most of the year. Annual rainfall is between 2800 and 3400 mm.
The Kahayan River originates in the northern mountains, then meanders for 600 km southward through the plains to the Java Sea. Tidal effects are felt 50 km - 80 km inland from the sea. A recent study found 28 species of fish throughout the river, 44 species in the Danau Sabuah lake and 12 species in the traditional fish ponds. The riparian wetlands were the main spawning areas. Fishermen are reporting declining yields due to problems with water quality.
People.
The Dayak tribes are the dominant people in the Kahayan river region. An Austronesian people, they have preserved some of their original culture and Kaharingan religion. They speak languages of the Barito family, related to the Malagasy language spoken in Madagascar. The Kaharingan religion combines ancestor worship, animism and dynamism. It is now considered a form of Hinduism.
The main Dayak tribes are the Ngaju, Ot Danum and Ma'anyan. The Ot Danum remain in the upstream regions of the Kahayan, Barito, Kapuas and Rungan rivers and preserve a traditional way of life. Many still live in longhouses and subsist through hunting, fishing and basic agriculture. Village elders practice traditional medicine and mark their status with intricate body tattoos and heavy ear adornments. The Ngaju have moved downstream, and to some extent assimilated with the mixed population of the towns further down the river, which includes Javanese, Maduranese, Batak, Toraja, Ambonese, Bugis, Palembang, Minang, Banjarese, Makassar, Papuan, Balinese, Acehnese and Chinese.
Peat Swamp Forest and the Mega Rice Project.
The lower reaches of the Kahayan river used to flow through a huge area of peat swamp forest, an unusual ecology that is home to many unique or rare species such as Orang Utans, as well as to slow-growing but valuable trees. The peat swamp forest is a dual ecosystem, with diverse tropical trees standing on a 10m - 12m layer of partly decayed and waterlogged plant material, which in turn covers relatively infertile soil. The peat swamp forests were being slowly cleared for small scale farming and plantations before 1997, but most of the original cover remained.
In 1996 the government initiated the Mega Rice Project (MRP), which aimed to convert one million hectares of peat swamp forest to rice paddies. Between 1996 and 1998, more than 4,000 km of drainage and irrigation channels were dug, and deforestation started in part through legal and illegal forestry and in part through burning. It turned out that the channels drained the peat forests rather than irrigating them. Where the forests had often flooded up to 2m deep in the rainy season, now their surface is dry at all times of the year. The government has therefore abandoned the MRP, but the drying peat is vulnerable to fires which continue to break out on a massive scale.
Peat forest destruction is causing sulphuric acid pollution of the rivers. In the rainy seasons, the canals are discharging acidic water with a high ratio of pyritic sulphate into the Kahayan river up to 150 km upstream from the river mouth. This may be a factor contributing to lower fish catches.
Mining.
People have panned for gold in the Kahayan river for centuries. Following test drilling, a consortium of Canadian and Indonesian companies announced in 1997 that in-situ gold resources were at least 3.4 million ounces. In 2002 a Canadian company with a background in community development programs proposed to develop artisanal mining in the headwaters of the Barito and Kahayan Rivers in Kalimantan, providing income for some 13,000 Dayak people at project maturity. A large number of informal prospectors are undertaking alluvial operations within the river system, and mining hard rock gold veins. Even those doing hard rock mining transport the ore to the rivers for processing. More than 2,000 illegal miners may converge on a site when there is a reported gold find. In Indonesia as a whole, nearly 180 tonnes of mercury are released to the environment annually.
Kelompok Hutan Kahayan or Sabangau Forest.
Hutan Kahaylan () is a peat swamp forest of about 150,000 hectares between the Kastingen and Kahayan rivers that so far has suffered least from the Mega Rice Project, although it has been badly damaged. Because it is close to the regional capital Palangkaraya it is still at risk. Vulnerable bird species include the Large Green Pigeon (Treron capellei) and possibly Storm's Stork (Ciconia stormi) and Lesser Adjutant (Leptoptilus javanicus). The Sabangau Forest is centered on the blackwater Sabangau River. There is no longer any continuous forest cover where Orang Utans may cross this river. The forest has been badly damaged by legal and illegal forestry, but the western part is now protected as either National Park or National Laboratory Research Area. With a relatively small human population, there is some hope that this area of the forest may recover. The more badly damaged eastern part, between the Sabangau and the Kayahan, is still officially designated for agriculture, although no further efforts are being made to make it suitable for this purpose.

VAW-115

Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 115 (VAW-115), also known as the "Liberty Bells", is a United States Navy squadron based at Naval Air Facility Atsugi that flies the E-2C Hawkeye 2000. The "Liberty Bells" are the Navy's only forward deployed Airborne Early Warning squadron and is the oldest and only original squadron in Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5).
History.
Since being established on 20 April 1967, VAW-115 has patrolled the skies of the Pacific Ocean and the Middle East. Originally flying the E-1B "Willie Fudd" with Attack Carrier Wing Two aboard the , the squadron has witnessed the evolution of carrier-based Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft, transitioning to the E-2B in 1970, the E-2C in 1985, the E-2C Group II Navigation Upgrade in 1998, and most recently the eight-bladed NP2000 variant in January 2007. They joined CVW-5 in 1970 and made two combat deployments to the Gulf of Tonkin between May 1971 and April 1973 on board the . In September 1973, CVW-5 moved to Yokosuka, Japan as a component of the Forward Deployed Naval Forces, and the only air wing home ported outside the continental United States.
VAW-115 E-2B Hawkeyes played a significant command and control role in Operation Frequent Wind, supporting the evacuation of Saigon in 1975. From the late 1970s throughout the 1980s, VAW-115 made eleven deployments to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea, a period which saw such tumultuous events as the Iranian seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran. In 1983, VAW-115 participated in rescue and salvage operations following the tragic shoot-down of Korean Airlines Flight 007. Two years later, the Liberty Bells supported Freedom of Navigation operations, both for the in the Sea of Japan and for Operation Earnest Will, protecting Kuwaiti re-flagged tankers through the Straits of Hormuz. During the 1989-90 deployments with the "Midway" Battle Group, the Liberty Bells and their E-2C Hawkeyes participated in Operation Classic Resolve, supporting the democratic government of the Philippines against a coup attempt. In response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, VAW-115 deployed to the Persian Gulf in October 1990 as part of Operation Desert Shield. In January 1991, Desert Shield transitioned to Desert Storm and saw VAW-115 flying 179 combat sorties. In August 1991, the was decommissioned and CVW-5 embarked on the . During the ensuing years, the squadron deployed to the Persian Gulf four times in support of Operation Southern Watch, enforcing a No-Fly Zone over the skies of southern Iraq. In January 1998, VAW-115 and the "Independence" Battle Group were called upon to participate in various Persian Gulf contingency operations in support of United Nations sanctions. After transitioning to the E-2C Group II Navigation Upgrade aircraft, VAW-115 cross-decked with CVW-5 to the in the Summer of 1998. In February 2003, the Liberty Bells were once again called to the Persian Gulf to support Operation Southern Watch and flew 46 combat sorties until the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003. During that operation, the Liberty Bells flew 363.8 hours in support of Army and Marine Corps units on the ground.
In the years that followed, VAW-115 continued to maintain a high level of readiness and promoted US strategic interests overseas by participating in exercises such as Valiant Shield, Malabar, and Talisman Saber as well as Exercises Annualex and Keen Sword with the Japanese Air and Maritime Self Defense Forces. Most recently, VAW-115 took part in joint and multi-national Exercise RIMPAC 2008, providing Airborne Battlespace Command and Control to 49 naval vessels, 150 aircraft, and 29 other foreign and U.S. units from 10 participating countries. Again, the Liberty Bells demonstrated a high degree of combat readiness and professionalism in this most challenging and dynamic environment.
VAW-115 has an amazing record with more than 23 years and 46,000 hours of Class-A mishap-free flight hours. In its distinguished history, VAW-115 also boasts eight Battle Efficiency "E" awards, seven AEW Excellence awards, and six Safety "S" awards. The sky is the limit for the Liberty Bells as they continue operations aboard America's first forward-deployed nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the . As always, VAW-115 will continue to be a potent part of "America's 911 Air Wing" in the highly demanding forward-deployed environment.

LT&amp;SR 69 Class

The LT&SR 69 class was a class of 0-6-2T steam locomotives designed for freight work on the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. Six were initially built in 1903 to the design of Thomas Whitelegg, four more followed in 1908, and a further four in 1912, after the LT&SR's takeover by the Midland Railway (MR) in that year, giving a total of 14. The Midland renumbered them 2180-93, and all entered LMS stock upon the grouping of 1923. The LMS renumbered them 2220-33 in 1923, but then took them back to 2180-93 in 1939. In 1947 they were again renumbered 1980-93 by the LMS, and in 1948 all were acquired by British Railways. BR added 40000 to their numbers so they became 41980-93. Withdrawals started in 1958, and by 1959 all but 41981 had gone. The last engine was withdrawn in 1962. None was preserved.

Shingle urchin

The shingle urchin or helmet urchin ("Colobocentrotus atratus") is a species of sea urchin in the family Echinometridae. In Hawaii it is known as "kaupali" which translates as "cliff-clinging". It is found on wave-swept intertidal shores in the Indo-West Pacific, particularly on the shores of Hawaii. 
Description.
This urchin is a deep maroon colour and shaped like a domed limpet. It can grow as big as a soft ball but is usually much smaller. The upper surface is a mosaic of tiny polygonal plates formed from modified spines to form a smooth mosaic. This is fringed by a ring of large, flattened modified spines. On the underside there is another ring of smaller flattened spines and a large number of tube feet.
Biology.
This urchin is usually found on substrates fully exposed to waves and their associated abrasive effect, often in groups. It feeds on periwinkles, other urchins and coralline algae. 
In a test comparing shingle urchins to other species of urchin, it was found that their ability to withstand being washed away by moving water excelled. A combination of their shape, their flattened spines and particularly the strong adhesion of their tube feet made them three times as resistant as other species such as "Echinometra". This enables them to live on inhospitable wave-battered shorelines.

For the Love of Mrs. Brown

For The Love of Mrs. Brown is the fourth play in the Mrs. Brown Series by Brendan O'Carroll, preceded by "Mrs. Brown Rides Again". The plot centres around the character Agnes Brown finding a date over the internet for Valentine's Day. The play is 125 minutes long. 
Plot.
A few days before Valentine's Day, Agnes is feeling down in the dumps. Even Grandad has a date. She is advised by Cathy to find a date over the internet. Meanwhile, Rory has found a small capsule of LSD tablets at the salon, and needs to find the owner so he can fire them. However, Mrs. Brown walks in on him talking to Dermot about it, and he is forced to tell her they are for indigestion. She stores them on the window sill and they are forgotten until the next act.

I Gusti Nyoman Lempad

I Gusti Nyoman Lempad (1862?–1978) was known as a Balinese stone sculptor and architect (Undagi in Balinese) who built the palaces and temples in Ubud and its neighboring villages. In his later years, he produced hundreds of linear drawings of Balinese mythology and folklore. "Lempad of Bali", a short documentary film produced by John Darling and Lorne Blair, tells the story of Lempad at the end of his life and his cremation ceremony.
Lempad's exact birth date, as many Balinese of his time, is unknown. But he was married when Krakatoa erupted in 1883. He died on April 25, 1978 at his home in Ubud, Bali. He gathered his family and asked them to bathe him and then died. The Balinese believed that he chose the time of his death at the day that considered most holy.
Although he maintained a close friendship with foreign artists, including Rudolf Bonnet and Walter Spies, Lempad never compromised his distinctive identity as a Balinese artist, and one with a broad range of talents in many media; painting, sculpture and architecture.

Texas Renaissance Festival

The Texas Renaissance Festival is a Renaissance fair in Todd Mission, Texas, about 50 miles northwest of Houston.
The Texas Renaissance Festival (TRF) started in 1974 on the location of an old strip mining site. The Texas Renaissance Festival claims to be "the nation’s largest Renaissance theme park." The festival sits on 55 acres of land, and offers camping facilities to patrons. The festival welcomes half a million guests annually.
History.
The Texas Renaissance Festival was founded in 1974 by George Coulman. At the time, it spanned only fifteen acres, with three stages featuring small improv theatre groups, and merchants selling their goods on blankets. The opening year saw a turn-out of 33,000, nearly a twentieth of the turnout of 2012.
Features.
The Texas Renaissance Festival features about 500 costumed performers on 17 stages; 340 shoppes including: international food purveyors, unique artisans, merchants and craft vendors; human-powered rides; an abundance of performers walking among the guests, and the Queen's Royal Finale (fireworks if weather permits) at dusk.
Themed Weekends.
Each of the eight weekends of the festival take on a different theme, influencing the performances, costumes, food, drink, art, shops, contests, and games throughout the festival grounds.
Performances.
The festival grounds feature 17 stages, which host a wide variety of performances. The festival features several medieval-themed music and dance groups, including everything from belly dancing, to harps and fiddles, to bagpipes and accordions, to the carillon. Also, throughout the festival several demonstrating artists can be found presenting the methods of various medieval trades, such as glassblowing, forging armor, candle-making, coin minting, and others to visitors.
On the larger stages, other, grander events take place, the largest of which is the Joust. The Joust is performed by the Hanlon-Lees Action Theatre, and is an accurate reenactment of a medieval joust, featuring authentic weapons, costumed horses, and armored knights. Other large performances at the festival include the Birds of Prey show, a highly praised free-flying bird show including hawks, owls, vultures, and eagles, the Fire, Whip Show, the Clan Tynker Family Circus, and the School of Sword.
At the end of the festival, a Royal Finale takes place in the Arena, featuring performances from several of the entertainers and musicians, and closing with a Royal Fireworks presentation.

Orbit (mascot)

Orbit is the name given to Major League Baseball's Houston Astros mascot, a lime-green outer-space creature wearing an Astros jersey with antennae extending into baseballs. Orbit was the team's official mascot from the 1990 through the 1999 seasons until the 2000 season, where Junction Jack was introduced as the team's mascot with the move from the Astrodome to then Enron Field. Orbit returned on November 2, 2012 at the unveiling of the Astros new look for their 2013 debut in the American League. The name Orbit pays homage to Houston's association with NASA and nickname "Space City".
History.
In April 1977 the Houston Astros introduced their very first mascot, Chester Charge. At that time there was only one other mascot in major league baseball, which was the San Diego Chicken. Chester Charge was a 45 pound costume of a cartoon Texas cavalry soldier on a horse. Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home game, during the seventh inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience would yell, “Charge!” The first Chester Charge was played by Steve Ross who was then an 18-year-old Senior High School student. The creation of Chester Charge and the (incredible for its day) scoreboard graphics were created by Ed Henderson.
Following a visit to then the AAA-Astros affiliate, the Tucson Toros in 1989, former team marketing Vice President Ted Haracz sought to bring the Toros' mascot, "Tuffy" to Houston to serve as the team's mascot. Although "Tuffy" was not promoted from Tucson, Hal Katzman, who performed as "Tuffy" was invited by the team to serve as Orbit for the 1990 season. The development of a team mascot for the 1990 season was viewed by the team as an important piece in its community outreach programs, specifically with children. 
Both the naming and design of the mascot were established from suggestion from local, Houston-area schoolchildren of which included Anthony Holan from Splendora, TX.. The design for Orbit was derived from more than 10,000 children's drawings submitted to the Astros, with the final design being a composite of the various drawings submitted. The first public appearance of Orbit occurred in January 1990 at Heflin Elementary School. 
One of the more notable incidents involving Orbit occurred when umpire Gary Darling ejected the mascot from the game for arguing balls and strikes. In addition to his role as the Astros' mascot, Orbit made a one-time appearance as "Marty the Mariner Martian" during a "Turn Ahead the Clock" promotion at a 1998 Seattle Mariners game.
Orbit was replaced with Junction Jack beginning in the 2000 season, with the team's move from the Astrodome to then Enron Field.
On April 13, 2010 a Facebook group called "Bring Back Orbit" was created with the hopes of having the Houston Astros organization to reinstate the mascot.
On November 2, 2012, the Astros revealed that after a 12-year absence, Orbit returned as the mascot for the 2013 season in the American League.

J.D. Farrell (sternwheeler)

"J.D. Farrell" was a sternwheel steamer that operated on the Kootenay River in western Montana and southeastern British Columbia from 1898 to 1902.
Design and Construction.
"J.D. Farrell" was designed and built by Captain M.L. McCormack, who had commanded steamboats on the Mississippi, St. Croix and Red rivers. He formed the Kootenay River Navigation Company to build and operate the vessel, which he named after J.D. Farrell, a wealthy mining backer from Spokane, Washington. "Farrell" was equipped with electric lights and bathrooms, then considered innovations in river transport in the region. In contrast to some of the other vessels built in the region, "Farrell" was competently designed and constructed by skilled shipbuilders brought out from Stillwater, Minnesota.
Operations.
"J.D. Farrell" was launched in November 1897 at Jennings, Montana. At that time the only competitor on this route was the Upper Columbia Navigation & Tramway Company, under Capt. Frank P. Armstrong. Construction of "Farrell" prompted Armstrong to hire veteran shipwright Louis Pacquet from Portland, Oregon to build a comparable vessel, the sternwheeler "North Star".
Captain M.L. McCormack commanded "Farrell" on the vessel's first trip up the Kootenay River to Fort Steele, BC. "Farrell" worked on the route from Jennings to Fort Steele during 1898. During 1898, Captain Armstrong and Captain McCormack combined their efforts on the upper Kootenay, with the Armstrong boats "North Star" and "Gwendoline" receiving 60% of the freight receipts, with the balance to McCormack's single boat "Farrell." James D. Miller (1830-1914) one of the Northwest's most experienced steamboat captains, commanded "Farrell" during this time.
On June 4, 1898 with Captain McCormack in command on the seventh trip, "Farrell" was wrecked in Jennings Canyon when hurricane-force winds blew the vessel off course into a rock. "Farrell" sank with only her bow and capstan showing above the water. While "Farrell" was later raised and repaired, and repaired, business declined sharply on the route as traffic shifted over to newly completed railways, causing "Farrell" to be laid up at Jennings from 1899 to 1901. In 1901 A. Guthrie & Co. bought "Farrell" for $6,000 use in construction of the Great Northern Railway to Fernie, BC. In the fall of 1901, the railway construction was complete, and "Farrell" was laid up again.
Dismantled.
In 1903 "Farrell" was dismantled. The machinery, fittings and much of the upper works were taken by train to Newport, Washington to become part of the sternwheeler "Spokane".

Andrew VanWyngarden

Andrew VanWyngarden (born February 1, 1983) is the lead vocalist, guitar player and songwriter for the band MGMT, praised for (according to "Interview Magazine") "an uncanny knack for producing pop music that sounds as if it were filtered through a kaleidoscope". One of his (and MGMT cofounder Ben Goldwasser's) songs "Kids" (from the "Oracular Spectacular" album) received a Grammy 2010 nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group, while the duo was nominated in the Best New Artist category.
Biography.
Andrew VanWyngarden was born in Columbia, Missouri, and grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, where he attended Lausanne Collegiate School and White Station High School. His father Bruce VanWyngarden is the editor of the alternative newspaper Memphis Flyer since 1992. Andrew fondly remembered his childhood years in Memphis, especially fishing and camping with his dad. "I've always really liked nature and the ocean. My friends and I would go out with nets and make little aquariums with the creatures we'd find," he said. He was active in YMCA outdoors programs, and the family frequently went canoeing, camping, and fishing. 
His first musical influences was listening to his dad play The Who song "Pinball Wizard" on his electric guitar with Fender Twin Reverb amp. In seventh grade he received a Les Paul guitar and immediately started playing, that same year he won a contest at Lausanne, playing “Under the Bridge” by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Also listening music with his sisters especially Nirvana and Phish and going through his parents record collection in the attic where he found Neil Young, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, etc. "From then on, all he ever wanted for Christmas was musical instruments; future seasons saw a drum set, a banjo, and a mandolin" 
While in high school he formed a band with Dan Treharne called Glitter Penis, and it was basically just the two playing around in the computer "just making songs," VanWyngarden says where they created and recorded parody songs but did not perform live. Then VanWyngarden was in a band called Accidental Mersh with future MGMT guitarist Hank Sullivant who would later introduce James Richardson future MGMT's guitarist. The band achieved local success and fame in and around the Memphis area, and released two albums: The self-titled Accidental Mersh and Mirror Isaeli. The first album reached the #2 spot on Napster's "Unsigned Bands" chart. The band went on hiatus when most of the band members went to college. Andrew invited Ben Goldwasser to play the keyboard for Mersh during the summer of 2002. The band had a weekly gig at Newby's but the new shows were sparsely attended and the band dissolved. In college, he wrote and performed a song called "Super Volcano" for a class.
VanWyngarden attended and graduated in music, from Wesleyan University, where he met fellow band member Ben Goldwasser in his freshmen year. He said he planned to study natural sciences of astronomy, but meeting Goldwasser changed his whole life course. It was Andrew who initiated the formation of the group: " wasn't really into it. I remember him saying he wanted to do some sort of social work, something noble for a good course. I was like: C'mon, man! Where's your selfish ambition?" he remembered. Andrew (according to Q) remembered his University years as something "almost sickeningly idyllic: lots of doing mushrooms in the woods, not a hard graft in the library". 
He has said in interviews that "Kids" was one of the first songs they produced together, the song is included in the band's early EP We (Don't) Care (release under the name The Management).
VanWyngarden was on NME's Cool List in 2008 at number 3, just below Jay-Z and Alice Glass.
Andrew came up with the title of MGMT's 2010 album "Congratulations" while making "Oracular Spectacular." He writes a lot of the lyrics for MGMT, he has described the process, "I'd sit down for a few hours and try to do them. Usually, the ideas for the lyrics have been in my head for a while, and that's how I go over them again and again." His favorite song of the new album is "Siberian Breaks". In a recent interview, speaking of fame and its effects on him, Andrew conceded that to some extent he's turned into a kind of character he was poking fun at in the debut album. "I didn't realize it until now, but it's kind of funny, because the first song on our first album was 'Time to Pretend', which was about the imagined rock star scenario. So, song 'It's Working' is like, "Yeah, we went out there and we did a lot of drugs, and it's not that great," he told "Spin".
Upon the release of "Congratulations", Andrew says he has gotten more of a kind of anxious feeling developing over the past year when they got a lot of criticism from music journalists.
He has cited his literary influences likes Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, the ice Storm, The Anthology of French Poetry and authors such as Robert Anton Wilson and John Ashbery. His favorite pastime is surfing and says that in the future he would like to produce.
Side projects.
Andrew VanWyngarden is in a project with Kevin Barnes from Of Montreal called Blikk Fang. He appeared in "The Heart is a Drum Machine," a documentary film about the nature of contemporary music. VanWyngarden mentions Werner Herzog, David Lynch, and Federico Fellini as his favourite directors.

Maximilian Haas

Maximilian Haas (born 7 December 1985) is a German professional footballer who plays as a central defender or defensive midfielder.
Football career.
Early years / Bayern.
Born in Freising, Bavaria, Haas played four years in the Landesliga with hometown's SE Freising, before joining FC Bayern Munich II in July 2007. He did not make his debut until 29 October of the following year, when he came on as a 59th-minute substitute for Mehmet Ekici in a 3–3 away draw against SV Sandhausen, but soon became a regular in the team, initially in midfield but subsequently in defence; on 14 February 2009 he scored his first goal for the reserves, in a 2–3 loss at Dynamo Dresden.
In 2010, Haas was picked by FC Bayern Munich manager Louis van Gaal for the first team, but continued to play mainly for the B-side. He played in pre-season friendlies with the main squad, most notably the Franz Beckenbauer farewell match against Real Madrid, but, not being involved in any competitive games, moved to England on 31 January 2011, signing for Football League Championship club Middlesbrough for an undisclosed fee.
Middlesbrough.
Haas made his debut for "Boro" against Queens Park Rangers, playing the last eight minutes in a 0–3 away defeat. He made his first full start in a 4–2 victory at Hull City, on 23 April 2011. 
At the end of the season, Haas was released by the club.
Portugal.
In January 2012, Haas had a trial at Karlsruher SC, but nothing came of it. At the end of the month he moved to Portugal and joined U.D. Leiria, signing until 30 June 2014. 
On 12 February 2012, Haas made his official debut for his new club, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–4 away loss to F.C. Porto. He was used regularly until the end of the campaign, but eventually rescinded his contract alongside several other players due to lack of payments, as the side ranked 16th and last in the league.
On 26 June 2012, Haas signed with S.C. Braga for three years. He played his first match on 28 October, replacing Paulo Vinicius in a 2–0 away win against C.S. Marítimo. He made his first start the following month in another away fixture, a 3–1 success at F.C. Pampilhosa for the season's domestic cup. 
Haas scored his first goal for the Minho outfit on 2 January 2013, helping to a 2–1 away win over Associação Naval 1º de Maio for the campaign's Portuguese League Cup.

Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International

The Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International (FGBMFI) is a fellowship of lay businessmen. Its main purpose is to bring interest to the Christian gospel. Theologically, the organisation has its roots in Pentecostalism.
History.
FGBMFI was founded in 1952 in Los Angeles by Demos Shakarian, a Californian dairy farmer of Armenian descent. Following a difficult start, it grew steadily, and after a few years branches were set up throughout the world.
After Demos Shakarian died in 1993, his son Richard Shakarian was appointed the organization's leader. The legitimacy of Richard's claim to leadership was disputed by some elements of the FGBMFI leadership, despite the mentoring he had received by Demos Shakarian before his death. There had been previous leadership disputes in FGBMFI's history.
One of those early groups that split encouraged other Chapters to leave and formed "IFCB". After Demos' death, several FGBMFI leaders who objected to Richard's leadership seceded and formed Business Mens Fellowship (BMF), which received its first financial contribution ($1,000)from Rose Shakarian, Demos Shakarian's widow. BMF was initially led by an attorney, who sued Richard. Steve Shakarian, Demos' son, later became one of the directors of BMF. In the mid-1990s, some major FGBMFI National Offices in Asia, namely Singapore and Hong Kong, withdrew from FGBMFI and allied themselves with the BMF. 
Despite these successes, in the mid-2000s, there was another leadership split. Instead of starting a new organization with a different name (as both IFCB and BMF had done), the new group named itself "Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship in America", or "FGBMFA", borrowing heavily from the FGBMI's official history in marketing.
Geographical spread.
FGBMFI is active in several countries. In some countries, it uses a version of its name translated in the local language. In Germany, e.g., "Christen im Beruf" (“Christians in professional life”), in Finland "Suomen Täyden Evankeliumin Liikemiesten Kansainvälinen Veljesliitto" (STELK), in several Spanish-speaking countries "Fraternidad Internacional de Hombres de Negocio del Evangelio Completo" (FIHNEC), in Poland "Miedzynarodowa Spolecznosc Biznesmenow Pelnej Ewangelii - Chrzescijanie w Biznesie". 
Similar organizations.
FGBMFI should not be confused with Christian Business Men's Committee (CBMC) and International Christian Chamber of Commerce (ICCC). CBMC, which was founded before the 2nd World War, has a broader theological background. ICCC was founded by FGBMFI members in Sweden, but it has a different purpose. Simultaneous membership of two or more of these organisations is generally not considered a problem.
There is some resemblance with Aglow. The latter, however, which is a fellowship of evangelical women, puts more emphasis on spiritual growth, while FGBMFI primarily focuses on spreading the gospel.

Jay Electronica

Timothy Elpadaro Thedford (born September 19, 1976), better known by his stage name Jay Electronica, is an American hip hop recording artist and record producer from New Orleans, Louisiana. He is currently based in London, United Kingdom. 
Electronica first gained significant attention after the release of the musical composition "Act I: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge)", which was made available on a MySpace page in 2007 and has been called a "timeless classic" by "Vice Magazine". It is fifteen continuous minutes of music, without drums, built from Jon Brion's soundtrack to the film "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". In late 2009 he released two singles, both produced by Just Blaze, "Exhibit A" and "Exhibit C", the latter of which won a Sucker Free Summit Award for Instant Classic. In November 2010, it was announced Jay Electronica had signed to hip hop mogul Jay-Z's Roc Nation record label.
Biography.
1976–2006: Early life and career beginnings.
Thedford was born on September 19, 1976, in the Magnolia Projects of New Orleans, renowned for having some of the highest crime rates in the country before being flooded during Hurricane Katrina. Thedford began rapping after hearing his nephew Akeem Pryor rhyme. By the age of 19 Jay Electronica left New Orleans to pursue his musical career. Living a mostly nomadic lifestyle, he found refuge in cities such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Detroit, New York, and briefly in Atlanta. From club to club, and stage to stage, Electronica had gotten booed off and denied because of his Southern accent and slang. "In my earlier years from when I first left home, I was embarrassed from being from the South," Thedford stated. "Not in general, but as a rapper because all of the negative things that people in the States put on the South." Electronica’s career really took form in the city of Detroit when he linked up with Detroit native Johnnie Last, a friend he had spent a lot of time with at Darp Studios in Atlanta, GA. In Detroit, Electronica met producer/engineer Mike "Chav" Chavarria, now a regular collaborator, who introduced him to both J. Dilla and Mr. Porter. It is here that he recorded his "Style Wars"-era music with several J. Dilla beats, meeting the producer subsequently to ask for permission to use the recordings as a demo.
2007–2010: "Act I: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge)" and signing with Roc Nation.
Jay Electronica first gained significant attention through "Act 1: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge)", made available on a MySpace page in 2007. It is fifteen continuous minutes of music, without drums, built from Jon Brion's soundtrack to the film "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". There are five segments or movements marked by changes in music and mood, raps by Electronica, and occasional snippets of sampled dialogue including scenes from "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory". The first segment is a spoken word piece by Just Blaze and Erykah Badu describing Electronica over piano music.
The nature of the piece of music, along with the nature of its appearance, led to a slow build-up of interest in Electronica as an enigmatic figure. Songs circulating online as the "Style Wars" EP gained wider circulation, and other songs, such as the dream-inspired "Dimethyltryptamine", soon appeared. In January 2008, Giles Peterson's 90-minute "Gilles Peterson Worldwide" was devoted to the rapper. Hiphopdx.com in 2008 called him "arguably...the most talked about new emcee last year ... at times...more like a myth or urban legend than an actual rapper", and "URB" ran a cover story on the artist under the banner "Jay Electronica: A Spotless Mind :: An MC’s mystery revealed", which referred to his wanderings as his being "like some sort of hip-hop Jack Kerouac".
Jeff Weiss' piece for the "L.A. Weekly", "Jay Electronica: Much Better Than His Name Would Suggest", acknowledged that the rapper could be fairly described as "one of the most buzzed about rappers of 2008", but attempted to temper the hype somewhat, describing "Act 1..." as "ambitious, wildly original, if not slightly pretentious", while endorsing only to an extent the comparisons "URB" had made (referencing an "abstract rhyming style") to rappers like Nas and Pharoahe Monch.
2010–present: "Act II: Patents of Nobility (The Turn)".
Jay Electronica has yet to release a full-length album, but he has released two official singles to date, "Exhibit A" and "Exhibit C", which won a Sucker Free Summit Award for Instant Classic. His music so far has been made available through the internet, either through being leaked to what "URB" magazine describes as "obscure web forums", or through an appearing and disappearing Myspace page (currently two seem to be in existence, at /jayelect and at /jayelectronica). Erykah Badu has questioned whether he ever will release, in her words, "actual albums".
From New Orleans, LA he has lived in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Denver, and Detroit, where he recorded his "Style Wars"-era music with several J Dilla beats, meeting the producer subsequently to ask for permission to use the recordings as a demo. Jay met producer/engineer Mike "Chav" Chavarria in Detroit, the latter introducing him to both J Dilla and Mr. Porter, and who is now a regular collaborator.
According to "URB", "Act II: Patents of Nobility" will feature Nas, and will be the second of a putative trilogy. "URB" also reported that digital EPs with both Guilty Simpson and producer 9th Wonder were planned. According to a Filter TV interview, Jay Electronica has partnered with Decon to release his debut project. It is being described as a multi-media release and footage from the project which was partially shot in Nepal and Dubai has begun to surface online. The first clip to leak is titled "Dear Moleskine" and can be found on YouTube, the track was produced by Just Blaze and the clip was directed by Jason Goldwatch from Decon. In June 2009, Decon and Jay's "The Dogon Society" released "Exhibit A" digitally. "Exhibit C" was released on iTunes December 16, 2009 and quickly shot to the top 10 of the iTunes Hip-Hop charts. The following week it was chosen by Hot 97's Dj Enuff as the Heavy Hitter pick of the week.
Jay Electronica appeared at the 2010 Bonnaroo Music Festival. Jay Electronica continued his scattered release practice, releasing "A Million in the Morning" on April 4, 2010. The song features a weary Electronica trying to keep himself awake to escape his nightmares. On April 30, Jay Electronica debuted "The Ghost of Christopher Wallace" via his Twitter. The song features P Diddy and is produced by London beatsmith Quincey Tones, who is known for producing such acts as Young Jeezy and Royce da 5'9".
On November 12, 2010, Jay-Z announced that Jay Electronica was officially the newest member of his Roc Nation imprint, which boasts such acts as J. Cole, and Willow Smith. Before signing to Roc Nation in 2010, Jay Electronica was a prospective signee of Bad Boy Records, a label owned by entrepreneur Sean “Diddy” Combs, with whom Electronica is professionally close with.
In late 2010, Electronica and actress Lucy Liu were featured on The Bullitts' song "Close Your Eyes". It was BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe's 'record of the week' and will feature on The Bullitts upcoming album, set for release in 2011. Then in July 2011, Electronica produced and was featured on the track "Run & Hide", which will be on the same album.
In July 2011, Jay Electronica posted via his Twitter that his debut album, "Act II: Patents of Nobility (The Turn)", was complete. On October 10, 2011, Jay Electronica released the song "Call of Duty" featuring Prodigy from Mobb Deep. He stated that this single would not be on his album. On March 8, 2012, Jay Electronica tweeted that the album is complete and will be turned in to Roc Nation 
Personal life.
Jay Electronica and Erykah Badu have 1 child together, Mars Merkaba Thedford, born on February 1, 2009. On June 2, 2012, it was revealed that Electronica had been having a "passionate" affair with Ben Goldsmith's music producer wife, Kate Rothschild, for a year. On discovering texts between Rothschild, with whom he has three children and had been with for eleven years, and Electronica, Goldsmith announced that he would be filing for divorce on the grounds of adultery. Electronica is a member of the Five Percent Nation.

Bruce Hylton-Stewart

Bruce de la Coeur Hylton-Stewart (27 November 1891 – 1 October 1972) played first-class cricket for Somerset and Cambridge University between 1912 and 1914.
Born at New Brighton and brought up also in Cheshire, where his father Charles Henry Hylton Stewart was a minor canon of Chester Cathedral. Hylton-Stewart was educated at Bath College. He was a right-handed lower or middle order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler.
He first appeared in first-class cricket in the Somerset match against the South Africans in 1912, when he replaced the injured Harry Chidgey after the game had started. Two weeks later, he made his only appearance of the 1912 season for Cambridge University, and then from mid-July appeared fairly regularly for Somerset for the rest of the season. His batting was not successful, but he had one sensational day as a bowler, taking five wickets for three runs in 14 balls against Worcestershire at Stourbridge: these remained the best bowling figures of his first-class cricket career.
In 1913, Hylton-Stewart played 11 first-class matches, most of them in the second half of the season and all of them for Somerset. He took five wickets in an innings for a second time, this time five for 72 against Yorkshire at Park Avenue, Bradford. His batting improved as well, and he made his first score of more than 50, an unbeaten 72 against Sussex at Bath.
The 1914 season was Hylton-Stewart's most successful as a batsman – he made 520 runs at an average of 20.80 per innings. After two matches for Cambridge in mid-season, he again played most of Somerset's matches in the second half of the year. Batting now in the middle order, he made his only first-class century, 110, made in 105 minutes out of an innings of 220, against Essex at Leyton. And late in the season, he made 91 against Worcestershire at Taunton.
Hylton-Stewart did not return to first-class cricket after the First World War but played Minor Counties cricket for Hertfordshire up to 1927. He died at Marlborough, Wiltshire.
Note on spelling.
Hylton-Stewart's surname is written without a hyphen in some non-cricketing references, regularly with a hyphen in cricketing references. Both his father and his older brother, Charles Hylton Stewart (1884–1932), who achieved fame as a composer of church music including settings for Psalms and as the organist at Rochester and Chester Cathedrals and at St George's Chapel, Windsor, are generally written without a hyphen.
Bruce Hylton-Stewart's middle name is also, in some references, spelled as "Delacour".

Ronald Brown (bishop)

Ronald Brown (born 7 August 1926) was the Suffragan Bishop of Birkenhead from 1974 until 1992.
Brown was educated at Durham University. After a curacy at St Laurence Chorley he was vicar of Whittle-le-Woods. Following this he was vicar of St Thomas', Halliwell, Bolton and then (his final appointment before his ordination to the episcopate) rural dean of Ashton-under-Lyne. In retirement he continued to serve as an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Liverpool until 2003. , Brown had returned to live in Chester, but there is no confirmation that he is licensed as a bishop in that diocese.

Bryn Evans (Welsh rugby union player)

Daniel Brinley 'Bryn' Evans (16 January 1902 – 29 April 1970) was a Welsh international rugby union scrum-half who played for Wales and Swansea.
Rugby career.
Evans originally played rugby for lower tier club Penclawdd, whose senior team he captained during the 1929/30 season, before moving to first class side Swansea.
Evans played only one game for Wales, against Scotland as part of the 1933 Home Nations Championship. Wales had just come away from an historic victory over England in the opening game of the competition, when the team won at Twickenham for the first time. Welsh hopes were high for the second game that was against Scotland at Swansea's home ground St Helens. The selectors wanted to stick with the same team that had beaten the English, but Maurice Turnbull had reported in injured. The selectors therefore decided to drop his partner, the reliable Harry Bowcott to allow for the Swansea partnership of Evans and Ron Morris to take their place. Although on home soil and against an inexperienced Scottish team, Wales lost 11-3, and Evans was dropped for the next match and never represented his country again.

Blackpool.
Fleetwood-born Crewdson made his debut for Blackpool, whom he joined from Fleetwood Mechanics, twelve games into their 1904–05 league season, a 4–2 defeat by Bristol City at Bloomfield Road on 19 November 1904. He went on to make just one other appearance that campaign.
The following season, 1905–06, he made thirteen league appearances and two in the FA Cup.
He made more appearances still in 1906–07 — 29 in the league and one in the FA Cup.
It was in 1907–08, that Crewdson became a regular in the team. He missed only one of Blackpool's 38 league games, and played in their one FA Cup tie (against Manchester United at Old Trafford).
Crewdson missed only two games of "the Seasiders"' 1908–09 league campaign and appeared in both Blackpool's first- and second-round FA Cup ties.
By contrast, injuries kept Crewdson out of the majority of the 1909–10 season. He made just ten appearances.
He returned to the team as a regular in 1910–11, making thirty league appearances. He also started in Blackpool's sole FA Cup fixture — another tie at Old Trafford.
1911–12 saw Crewdson miss only three league games. He again appeared in all of Blackpool's four FA Cup ties (including two first-round replays against Crewe Alexandra).
Crewdson appeared in less than half of Blackpool's 1912–13 league calendar. He did, however, start both FA Cup ties against Tottenham Hotspur in January 1913. His final appearance for Blackpool occurred on 1 March, in a 4–2 defeat at Bradford City.

Samuel Orton Harrison House

The Samuel Orton Harrison House was selected for inclusion in the Historic American Buildings Survey (1937) as significantly representative of Greek Revival architectural style. The dwelling was built between 1830 and 1840 and remained in possession of Mrs. Hannah Harrison until 1946 when the property was sold to historic preservationist Raymond Dey. At the time of sale the structure was virtually unchanged from its initial build. Dey subsequently performed renovations and minor alterations to the first floor plan to enable continued use as a private residence. Under subsequent ownership the house was placed on the National Register of Historic Placeson October 26, 1979.
The property came under threat as the estate of the late Sandford Cole was being probated during the peak of a highly speculative real estate market in 2007. The town, eager to reassert manifest destiny and rid itself of an albatross of history, quickly approved demolition. The structure was razed without notice much to the sadness of many local residents.
As for Timothy Cole's share of the estate, it has since been largely dissipated in the securities markets by the estate managers for the late Sandford S. Cole.

Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway

The Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway (DNGR, DN&GR) was an Irish gauge () railway in Ireland. It was conceived in the 1860s to provide a link between the towns in its title and the London and North Western Railway port at Greenore, from where a ferry service operated to Holyhead. It was opened between Greenore and Dundalk in 1873 and extended to Newry in 1876.
Ownership.
The L&NWR owned the railway and at first provided its locomotives and rolling stock, the locomotives coming from its Crewe Works. The railway passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 but an agreement was reached in 1933 for the line to be worked by the Great Northern Railway (Ireland). Because the partition of Ireland placed the Irish border across the DN&G's Greenore – Newry line, it was not absorbed into either the Great Southern Railways in 1925 or the Ulster Transport Authority in 1948.
Closure.
The line was closed on 31 December 1951 and was dissolved in 1957 by act of consent.

Brightlingsea railway station

Brightlingsea railway station was located in Brightlingsea, Essex. It was on the single track branch line of the Wivenhoe and Brightlingsea Railway which opened in 1866 and closed in 1964.
History.
The station building was located on the southern side of Lower Park Road where the town's community centre now sits.
The station and line was built by The Wivenhoe & Brightlingsea Railway company. This been incorporated in 1861 to build a line from Wivenhoe to Brightlingsea which opened on 17 April 1866. The company was a separate, but associated, company to the Tendring Hundred Railway which had built the line from Colchester to Wivenhoe. The GER soon negotiated to buy both the Tendring Hundred Railway and the Clacton-on-Sea Railway, and both became part of the GER on 1 July 1883. The Wivenhoe & Brightlingsea was absorbed by the GER on 9 June 1893.
The line was temporarily closed on 1 February 1953 following severe flood damage but was not reopened until 7 December that year.
Closure.
The service was identified for closure the Beeching Report of 1963 and was eventually axed in 1964. This was supposedly prompted by the high costs of maintaining the railway swing bridge over Alresford Creek, which was necessary to allow boat traffic to the many sand and gravel pits in the area.
The station building stayed in place for four years after the railway's closure until it was damaged by fire in 1968. The building was finally demolished in November 1969.
Remains of railway.
The visible relics of the railway's presence today are the Railway public house and micro-brewery, and the old embankment which is now a footpath. It is possible to walk along virtually the whole length of the former route from very near the site of the old station in Brightlingsea along the old embankment to the site of the former swing bridge. This makes for a pleasant, scenic walk alongside the River Colne with its the ecologically interesting salt marsh environment.
The nearest railway station is now at Alresford.

<doc id="20139269" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20139269" title="Episcopal Diocese of Quincy">
Episcopal Diocese of Quincy

The Episcopal Diocese of Quincy is a diocese of the Episcopal Church in western Illinois. It was established in 1877. The Episcopal Church is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The cathedral seat (home of the diocese) was originally in Quincy but was moved to St. Paul's Cathedral in Peoria in 1963. In order to avoid confusion with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria, the diocese retained the name of the location of its original "home" city, Quincy, where its cathedral seat was St. John's.
In November 2008, a majority of the diocesan synod (or diocesan convention) voted to leave the Episcopal Church and associate with Anglican Province of the Southern Cone, a member province of the worldwide Anglican Communion, as part of the conservative Anglican realignment movement. Those parishes and parishioners who did not vote to leave the Episcopal Church remain and continue as the (Episcopal) Diocese of Quincy. This included the Cathedral parish of St. Paul in Peoria, the largest parish in the diocese. Those who left the Episcopal Church formed the Southern Cone Diocese of Quincy.
An executive committee was elected at the cathedral on December 13, 2008, to carry out the business of the Committee to Reorganize the Diocese of Quincy, in communion with the Episcopal Church, particularly to organize a special synod of the Diocese of Quincy to elect a standing committee and other officials of the diocese. The Rt. Rev. Keith Whitmore, assistant bishop of the Diocese of Atlanta, retired bishop of the Diocese of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, served the Diocese of Quincy, as consulting bishop, until a special synod, held at the cathedral on April 4, 2009. The synod elected the Rt. Rev. John Clark Buchanan, retired Bishop of West Missouri, as provisional bishop.
Anglican realignment.
The diocese did not ordain women to the presbyterate, but does have two female deacons. As of 2006 it was one of three dioceses in the Episcopal Church that did not ordain women; the other two were the Diocese of San Joaquin, whose convention voted to secede from the Episcopal Church in December 2007, and the Diocese of Fort Worth, whose convention voted in November 2008 to secede.
In 2006, the diocese issued a news release saying that it was "unwilling to accept the leadership" of Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori, and passed resolutions asking for "alternative pastoral oversight" and withdrawing consent to be included in Province 5 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America.
On November 7, 2008, the 131st Synod of the Diocese of Quincy voted to leave the Episcopal Church and instead join the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone. As Keith Ackerman's resignation as bishop took effect on November 1, the Rev. Canon Edward den Blaauwen of Moline, Illinois was appointed to preside over the synod.
The major resolutions, which both passed, were to annul the diocese's accession to the constitution and canons of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America and to join the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone. After the vote to realign passed, it was announced that Archbishop Gregory Venables of the Southern Cone diocese appointed den Blaauwen as vicar general in the absence of a sitting bishop.
Also passed by the synod were: a resolution that parishes may withdraw from "the Synod of this Diocese" by a two-thirds vote within the following nine months, and clergy may transfer to other dioceses; a resolution seeking an amicable settlement regarding diocesan assets with the Episcopal Church and any congregations that might seek to remain in the Episcopal Church; a resolution that other parishes outside the geographic boundaries may join the synod of the diocese; funding for the Province of the Southern Cone and the Anglican Communion Network; support for the Common Cause Partnership; and a new diocesan canon to govern marriage, defined as being between "one man and one woman".
The Episcopal Church's Presiding Bishop, Katharine Jefferts Schori, stated that "The Episcopal Diocese of Quincy remains, albeit with fewer members." The legitimacy of other secession actions has been actively challenged by the Episcopal Church, which takes the position that dioceses and parishes may not leave without the Episcopal Church's governing bodies. As a consequence, the long-term effect of these votes is unclear, as with similar cases in the Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin and the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh; those two dioceses have each split into two factions, with each faction claiming to be the legitimate succession of the traditional diocese. Neither secession nor annulment of accession is either prohibited or provided for by the Constitution and Canons of the Episcopal Church. The Constitution and Canons of the Province of the Southern Cone allow only dioceses in the six southern nations of South America, but the Province of the Southern Cone has agreed to accept realigning dioceses "on an emergency and pastoral basis". None of these three dioceses are listed as part of the Province of the Southern Cone by the Anglican Communion office.
Reunification.
In February 2012 representatives of the Diocese of Quincy and the Diocese of Chicago met in Peoria to discuss reunification of the two dioceses. The meetings in Peoria ended with a decision to continue talks.
On April 28, 2012, leaders from both dioceses met to further discuss reunification. Participants from both dioceses agreed to meet again in August, as well as to allocate time to discuss the issue at the annual diocesan wide conventions held by both dioceses. The participants also agreed to form a joint working group to discuss some of the legal issues involved with the process.
In November the Chicago diocese's convention agreed that reunification with the Quincy diocese should be pursued. On June 8, 2013, both diocesan conventions voted unanimously to reunify. The reunification is now subject to approval by a majority of bishops and the standing committees of the Episcopal Church. If approved the reunified diocese would be known as the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago.

Gare de Saint-Nazaire

The Gare de Saint-Nazaire is the passenger railway station serving the French town and port of Saint-Nazaire.
Designed by Noel Lemaresquier with a functional and maritime style, it was built in 1995 in anticipation of the arrival of the LGV Atlantique and replaced an older station in the town developed by the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans railway. Located to the north of the town, to make access easier there is a bridge linking the station to the main town centre.
Its design has come in for some local criticism in 2008, as well as its state of upkeep. SNCF have promised various levels of maintenance and development, particularly to assist disabled passengers and make a better impression on visitors to the town. Access to the station by foot or car is currently difficult, due to associated and local redevelopment.
Services.
The station is served by both the TGV and the regional trains and buses of the TER Pays de la Loire. The TGV (high speed train) provides connection to Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Lille, and Strasbourg; with trains to Paris via the LGV Atlantique taking just over 2 hours. TER Pays de la Loire and Interloire provide links to Nantes, Angers, Le Mans, La Roche sur Yon, and many other regional cities and towns.

Rose Clark

Rose Clark (1852–1942) was an early 20th-century American painter and pictorial photographer. She is best known for the photographs she exhibited with Elizabeth Flint Wade under their joint names, either as "Rose Clark and Elizabeth Flint Wade" or as "Misses Clark and Wade".
Life.
Harriet Candace "Rose" Clark was born in 1852 in La Port, Indiana. She was trained as a painter and taught painting and drawing in the 1880s at Saint Margaret’s School in Buffalo, New York. One of her students was Mabel Dodge Luhan, and Clark later designed and restored Luhan’s villa in Florence, Italy.
Beginning in 1890 she became active as a photographer and worked independently until 1898. Sometime in the late 1890s she met Wade, and the two began their twelve-year collaboration. About 1900 she began corresponding with Alfred Stieglitz, who encouraged and counseled her in her art. Stieglitz cited her, along with Gertrude Käsebier, Eva Watson-Schütze, and Mary Devens, as one of the ten most prominent American pictorial photographers currently working in an article in "Century Magazine" in 1902.
Clark apparently learned some of her photographic artistry from Käsebier; later in her life she said she owed Käsebier for "any success she had with a camera".
About 1920 she moved from Buffalo to New York City, where she advertised her portraits and other paintings for substantial amounts (up to $2,000 for full-length portraits). She returned to Buffalo in 1926.
Clark never married and little is known about her private life. She died in Buffalo on 28 November 1942 and was buried in La Porte. Her obituary focused on her work as a painter and did not mention anything about her photography.
Misses Clark and Wade.
For reasons that have never been explained, Clark and Wade began exhibiting and publishing photos under their joint names beginning in 1899. For many years it was assumed that Clark was the artist who took all of the photographs and Wade was the technician who developed and printed them. Clark herself alluded to this type of arrangement in a letter to Stieglitz in 1900: “Mrs. Wade is very dilatory – and in order to get the photographs you ask for… I will have to prod her daily.” However, in a letter to Frances Benjamin Johnston that same year, Clark said “Both Miss Wade and myself have used cameras for perhaps ten years or more, but it is only two years ago that we took up portrait work as a business.”
The concept of the artist/technician split in their partnership also might have come from the fact that Clark also had several solo exhibitions while Wade exhibited very little under her own name. There are, however, indications that Wade made aesthetic decisions as well as technical ones. She clearly had interest in and knowledge of aesthetics, and in several of her articles she gives advice on artistic direction. In addition, at least one article featured work under her name alone along with others under their joint names.
Clark and Wade first exhibited under their joint names at shows at the Buffalo Society of Artists and the New York Camera Club in 1899. Over the next decade their photos were featured in major exhibitions around the world, including the Art Institute of Chicago, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Photo Club de Paris, Pan-American Exposition, Corcoran Gallery of Art and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.
In 1902 Stieglitz included a print by Clark and Wade in Series 2 of the landmark portfolio "American Pictorial Photography". Printed in a limited edition of 150 copies, the portfolio was intended to show only the best photography according to Stieglitz’s discerning eye.
Their collaboration apparently ended around 1910. The reason for the dissolution of their joint effort is not known, although it might have been due to a change in the health of Wade, who died five years later.

Controversy and recall petition.
In March, 2013, while in a legislative hearing about legislation to ban concealed carry firearms from college campuses, rape survivor Amanda Collins discussed how, when attacked by convicted rapist and murderer James Biela, she wished she had a firearm to defend herself. Hudak responded: "I just want to say, statistics are not on your side, even if you had had a gun. You said that you were a martial arts student, I mean person, experience in taekwondo, and yet because this individual was so large and was able to overcome you even with your skills, and chances are that if you had had a gun, then he would have been able to get than from you and possibly use it against you..." Hudak's comments sparked outrage and were described as insensitive to rape victims. A recall petition was created by several Colorado citizens opposed to the legislation.
Between September 6–7, 2013, Hudak was attending hearings of the Colorado Corrections Department and Parole Division, and was caught updating Facebook and Twitter with material unrelated to the hearings. When confronted with evidence she described it as "extraneous."
On October 4, 2013, a second effort to recall State Senator Hudak as a result of her support for gun control began. Two members of the Colorado State Legislature were recalled from office earlier in 2013.
Resignation.
On November 27, 2013, the Denver Post announced that Hudak intended to resign her seat in the face of the recall. Hudak later held a press conference where she announced her resignation. Because she is resigning, the Democrats will be able to appoint a replacement; if she had been recalled, the Republicans could have gained a majority in the state senate. Her resignation was a recognition that the recall effort might have been successful.
Personal life.
She has been married to Edward Hudak since 1972; they have one child, daughter Genevieve, a computer programmer who graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder.
Hudak is an active participant in the Business and Professional Women, the local Chamber of Commerce, and the League of Women Voters. Since 1993 she has served on the Colorado PTA Board of Directors, and she serves on her local PTA council’s board of directors as well.

<doc id="20139348" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20139348" title="Burmese hip hop">
Burmese hip hop

The Burmese hip hop is one of the most successful music genres in Myanmar today, and arguably the most popular form of music among the urban youth of Yangon and Mandalay.
First generation.
Until 2000, rock and roll was the dominant music genre in Myanmar. The Burmese hip hop scene started in the late 1980s with the rapper Myo Kyawt Myaing although songs were plain rapping music rather than typical hip hop. In late 1990s, a Yangon-based four-member band named Acid started introducing old school hip hop in night clubs of Yangon, and became popular among Yangon's youth. Acid, widely considered to be the pioneers of Burmese hip-hop, made their debut in 2000 with "Sa-Tin-Gyin" (Beginning).
Their success attracted other hip-hop artists and groups, now known as the "first generation" of Burmese hip-hop, like Theory (Barbu and Thxa Soe), NS (Kyaw Thu Soe and Lin Lin) and Too Big. Most of the first generation artists used old school hip-hop. Still, hip hop was new to the Burmese and not widely accepted yet by the public at large. To find wider acceptance, some first-generation artists such as Sai Sai Kham Hlaing and Ye Lay mixed hip-hop with pop, and found commercial success.
Second generation.
After Acid's breakthrough, a group named "9mm" moved the style of Burmese hip hop to new level. Although the group's underground music was well known to the youth, most of their songs did not pass the Burmese censor board, and the group never released an own album under 9mm. Later, because of the group's political activism, even the name 9mm was banned by the censor board.
Other notable groups were G-Family,Project-1, Byauk-Oh (Firecracker), Examplz, On-track, Cyclone. M.H.A. (Myanmar HipHop Association)[http://www.mha-music.com] was formed unofficially. Many youth joined M.H.A. and inspired to becoming hip hop artist someday. From Mandalay, known to be the source of traditional music and culture of Burma, came many hip hop artists and groups even though they were not many as in Yangon.
Third generation.
Since late 2006, new artists like Jauk Jack Kyaw Htut Swe claimed themselves as "third generation". They formed a group called VIP (Rock$tar) with Ah Boy, Htein Win and Hlwan Paing. They became the most famous third gen rappers. They made history in the Burmese music industry because they became the most famous artists without having released an album. In late 2008 and early 2009, many other third generation groups released their sample albums such as XHumeXhume[http://www.facebook.com/xhume, RubberBand, Platform Crew Songs, Tiny Twist,William,Roll One..
Politics.
Many of the rappers had been detained or called for question by government. Zayar Thaw served 6 years prison term until 17 May 2011 because he is the member of Generation Wave (youth anti-gov group). His group-mate, also member of GW, Yan Yan Chan released from a temporary detainment center not long ago. The name 9mm is banned to used in public because they distributed sample CDs of underground group MFG [http://www.mmfg.netfirms.com/index2.html] in one of their performance.
G-Tone from Cyclone called to question during performing in concert.

Reception.
"Allmusic" stated in its review: ""South Coast of Texas" was a transition album toward the mature Clark style, one that was first to emerge on his next album, "Better Days". It's not a landmark in his catalog, but neither is it anything that could remotely be considered a failure."

Linda Newell

Linda Newell is a legislator in the U.S. state of Colorado. Elected to the Colorado State Senate as a Democrat in 2008, Newell represents Senate District 26, which encompasses southern suburbs of Denver, including Littleton, Colorado.
Biography.
Born in Oregon, Newell earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Irvine. She holds a certification as a Senior Professional in Human Resources is a Registered Organization Development Professional, and has worked as a business consultant in the fields of human resources, corporate education and workforce development. Most recently, she served as Senior Director of Learning and Development at StarTek. She is now a contract senior consultant with EPI, a human performance consulting firm. 
Newell has also served on the Denver Metro Regional Workforce Development Council and the Governor’s Taskforce on Workforce Development and has been a member of the National Business Executives, the Women’s Professional Network, the American Society of Training and Development, the Society for Human Resource Management, and The Organizational Development Institute.
Newell has also volunteered with a number of non-profit organizations, including the American Red Cross, the Special Olympics, the March of Dimes, Season for Non-Violence, Stalking Rescue, AXIS Intervention and Training Institute, and The Conflict Center, in addition to having served as the an Education Foundation Chairperson for a chapter of the American Association of University Women and the Performing Arts Chair for the Lakewood Arts Council.
Newell is also a single mother of two daughters, Kate and Brittany, and currently resides in Littleton, Colorado. As a single mother, Newell struggled in the past to pay down personal debt stemming from the Savings and Loan Crisis and to provide health insurance coverage for her family. Since being elected Newell has maintained an active role in her daughters' educations: Brittany is studying music performance at Arapahoe Community College and Kate is working towards her undergraduate degree in Diversity/Divinity at Regis University with plans to be an interfaith minister.
Legislative career.
2008 election.
The retirement of Sen. Steve Ward, upon his campaign for Congress, left an open seat in the historically Republican district. Newell kicked off her campaign in July 2008, and had no opposition in the August Democratic primary. Newell focused on grassroots campaigning, with supporters knocking on over 30,000 doors and making over 10,000 phone calls to prospective voters, focusing on the city of Centennial. During her campaign, Newell focused on economic and education issues and called for increased resources for victims of domestic violence.
She faced Republican Rep. Lauri Clapp in the November 2008 general election. Clapp, who had been term-limited out of the state house in 2006, was criticized by Newell for missing multiple candidate forums; in mid-October, Newell called for her opponent to make a public appearance. Clapp's candidacy was endorsed by the "Denver Post", but as of mid-October, Newell had also out-raised her opponent, taking in $33,000 to Clapp's $30,000.
Newell's race was the closest of Colorado's legislative races. Two days after the election, Newell led Clapp by only 69 votes out of 59,000 cast. 
With the race undecided as provisional ballots were counted, Newell attended member orientation at the state capitol, and both candidates caucused with their respective parties before the race was settled. A final count, completed two weeks after the election, gave Newell a margin of 195 votes, a margin of victory large enough to avoid an automatic recount.
Newell's victory increased the Democrat's Senate majority by one seat over the previous legislative session. Looking towards representing a "swing" district, Newell began her Senate term by scheduling town hall meetings and a "listening tour" within her district.
2009 legislative session.
For the 2009 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Newell was named to seats on the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate Local Government and Energy Committee. She was also appointed to the Colorado Workforce Development Council.
During the 2009 session, Newell sponsored legislation recommended by the Child Welfare Action Group to require that social services case workers be trained in child welfare.

Auctioneers Act 1845

The Auctioneers Act 1845 (citation 8 & 9 Vict., c.15) was an Act to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, passed during the reign of Queen Victoria on 8 August 1845, with the long title "An Act to impose a new duty on the licence to be taken out by all auctioneers in the United Kingdom". 
The initial Act instituted a tax on licenses for auctioneers to raise capital. This was repealed, however, by the Finance Act 1949. 
Only one section of the Act remains in British law - Section 7, which states that auctioneers must place a board with their full name and residence that is "publicly visible and legible" in the room where the auction takes place before, during and after the auction. This was to allow people to make formal complaints against auctioneers in cases of fraud or other offenses. This section was expanded by the Auctions (Bidding Agreements) Act 1927, to impose a penalty of 20 pounds sterling upon any auctioneer who failed to follow the Act.

Abraham Woods

Abraham Lincoln Woods, Jr. (October 7, 1928 – November 7, 2008) was an American civil rights leader, who helped coordinate the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and stood behind Martin Luther King, Jr. during his historic "I Have a Dream" speech.
Early life.
Woods was born on October 7, 1928 in Birmingham, Alabama. He was one of 11 children born to his parents, Rev. Abraham Woods Sr. and the former Maggie Wallace. He attended Morehouse College with Martin Luther King, Jr., and later received a Bachelor of Theology at Birmingham Baptist College, a bachelor's in sociology at Miles College and a master's degree from the University of Alabama in American history.
Civil rights movement.
Woods had been pastor of the First Metropolitan Baptist Church in the early 1960s and led the St. Joseph Baptist Church starting in 1967 as its pastor.
In addition to his service as the president of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Woods would often lead community marches to protest community violence, police shootings and slumlords. Woods was one of the coordinators of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and stood behind Martin Luther King, Jr. during his "I Have a Dream" speech on August 28, delivered to a crowd of 250,000 from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
Little more than two weeks after Dr. King's speech, Woods was at the site of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing minutes after the explosion resulted in the deaths of four girls. "They found shoes. Finally they found bodies. You could smell the human flesh", he told "The New York Times". While Ku Klux Klan member Robert Chambliss had been convicted in 1977, a new investigation spurred by Rev. Woods' efforts led to the conviction of Thomas Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry, two other Klan members, who were found guilty by state juries of all four murders and sentenced to life in prison.
Later life.
Woods helped bring attention to the issue of segregation at country clubs, staging protests that the 1990 PGA Championship, one of professional golf's four major tournaments, was going to be played at the Shoal Creek Golf and Country Club near Birmingham, which at the time had no black members. The PGA considered moving the tournament to a new site but reached a compromise with the club in which a local insurance executive was invited to become an honorary member with full membership privileges. The PGA and USGA changed rules regarding course selection, requiring clubs that hosted events to meet inclusive membership requirements.
In 1997, Woods had been invited to a Promise Keepers luncheon that had been extended to him by a white Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, but was reluctant to attend as he perceived it to be "a white male organization". He attended despite his misgivings and was impressed by the number of the organization's top officers who were black.
Introducing himself at a 2004 news conference staged to protest an unjust police shooting, Woods stated that he had "sometimes been called a troublemaker in the city of Birmingham, an agitator," but turned the word around by noting that he didn't resent the title of "agitator" because he could recall that "the little old lady said if a washing machine didn't have an agitator, then it wouldn't get the clothes clean."
Woods died at age 80 on November 7, 2008 at Princeton Baptist Medical Center in Birmingham, having battled cancer for several years.
He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery.

<doc id="20139408" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20139408" title="Decommissioning in Northern Ireland">
Decommissioning in Northern Ireland

Decommissioning in Northern Ireland was a process in the Belfast Agreement as part of the Northern Ireland peace process. Under the Belfast Agreement, all paramilitary groups fighting in The Troubles would decommission. The concern about decommissioning was a defining issue in the effort to negotiate a peace in Northern Ireland.
Belfast Agreement.
The Belfast Agreement, or Good Friday Agreement, was signed in Belfast on 10 April 1998 (Good Friday) by the British and Irish governments and endorsed by most Northern Ireland political parties.
It contained provisions for a government involving both Catholics and Protestants, whose traditional aspirations, expressed as Republicanism and Unionism, had often clashed over the years. It recognised the legitimacy of those aspirations. One of the provisions of the agreement was that the parties agree to collectively use their influence to achieve decommissioning within two years – by May 2000.
Independent International Commission on Decommissioning.
The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) was established to oversee the decommissioning. Its objective was to facilitate the decommissioning of firearms, ammunition and explosives.
Decommissioning troubles.
Into late 2001, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) was reluctant to disarm. The IRA refused to disarm because they said that the British government had reneged on its side of the bargain, by watering down reforms of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and by failing to pull troops out of Northern Ireland.
After the original deadline for decommissioning – May 2000 – passed, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning set 30 June 2001. That date passed as well without full disarmament.
The crisis hit its climax in July 2001 as David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader, resigned as first minister of the power-sharing Northern Ireland executive in protest against the IRA failure to redeem its pledge to put its weapons "completely and verifiably beyond use" (he was later re-elected). The peace process was on the brink of collapse again after the Provisional IRA failed to convince the UK Government or the Ulster Unionists that they had made "sufficient progress towards decommissioning".
Breakthrough.
On 7 August 2001, the IRA agreed on a method of destroying its arsenal. Tony Blair, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time, described the breakthrough as "significant" and "historic". Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, chairman of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, said the proposals had been accepted by the panel as ones that would "put I.R.A. arms completely and verifiably beyond use." The Ulster Unionists had said they would no longer take part in the Northern Ireland Assembly if the IRA did not begin disarming. The announcement came after meetings between the commission and a representative of the IRA.
After the September 11 attacks, the paramilitary groups stepped up their decommissioning.
In June 2009, both the UVF and Red Hand Commando announced that they had completed a process of decommissioning. The UDA confirmed it has started a process that would lead to the destruction of all its arms.

Access.com described the iCast as a "non-traditional, actuality-heavy five-minute newscast." The runtime was fluid, ranging from 5–7 minutes in length. Under the direction of Mavridis, a correspondent with CBS News since 2002, the iCast was initially presented in a "theatre-of-the-mind" radio format, employing dramatic elements mixed with natural-sound audio, news interviews and current music. Mavridis developed the style that mimicked talking to pre-recorded interviews and newsmakers. 
"Billboard" magazine's Radio and Records described Mavridis's original iCast format as transforming "the traditional role of a reporter into more of an audio guide with an edge who leads the listener through a news story's chain of interrelated actualities."
Each show opened with the big story of the day, usually in a mock-conversation format, inserting pre-taped interviews and field reports to create the illusion of a conversation. The second segment is usually another major story of the day told in a slightly more sobering method. It is followed by "The World", which details three typically odd international news pieces, followed by the closing item, which was often an odd "kicker" story which usually involved heavy music production.
Distribution.
According to the July 26, 2006 edition of "Billboard" magazine, the podcast was "made available to more than 500 CBS Radio News affiliates, as well as via the CBS Radio network and the group’s own Web site. One day after its debut on July 26, 2008, CBS News Vice President of Radio Harvey Nagler told the "New York Times" that he believed Mavridis's "iCast" would "most definitely change the way (people) think of CBS Radio News." 
Impact on Journalism.
Beginning in the fall of 2006, several top journalism schools across the United States and Canada adopted the "iCast" as part of their respective curricula. Columbia School of Journalism taught an "iCast" class. Professors at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and Jacksonville University used several editions of the "iCast" to teach classes in "the Future of Media" and "the Future of News Writing." Toronto's Ryerson University school of Journalism, Humber College School of Journalism and Seneca College Broadcasting School also use the "iCast" as a teaching tool. According to a 2007 radio interview on Montreal station CJAD, Mavridis regularly tours some of these schools "lecturing on new media, grading writing projects and later imploring broadcast journalism students to drop out and enroll in dental college."
End of the iCast.
After Mavridis's departure from CBS News in September, 2006, the iCast was hosted by various correspondents from CBS News Radio. Anchor Jim Chenevey hosted the show for several weeks, infusing music and humor into the show. Correspondent Dave Barett hosted occasionally and continued the tradition of innovative story telling through strong writing, music and use of sound. Eventually, CBS anchor and WCBS News reporter Jim Taylor assumed full-time iCast duties. The show, while still creative, began to veer towards a more traditional-sounding newscast. By the spring of 2007, the iCast was cancelled and replaced by a recording of CBS Radio's World News Roundup, anchored by Nick Young.

Valkaria Airport

Valkaria Airport is a public-use airport located west of the central business district of the city of Grant-Valkaria in Brevard County, Florida, United States. The airport is publicly owned.
The airport was originally constructed by the U.S. Navy during World War II as Outlying Field Valkaria (OLF Valkaria), an auxiliary airfield to Naval Air Station Melbourne, now Melbourne International Airport. OLF Valkaria was closed in late 1945 and did not reopen for flight operations until 1959. During the 1950s, 60s and 70s, the site was used as a Missile Trajectory Measurement (MISTRAM) station by the U.S. Air Force and NASA in support of launch operations at Cape Canaveral AFS and Kennedy Space Center.
In 1959, the United States Department of Defense and the General Services Administration conveyed that part of the Valkaria facility not dedicated to MISTRAM to the county government of Brevard County, Florida for use as a public airport.

Subh Sukh Chain

Subh Sukh Chain () was the national anthem ("Qaumi Tarana") of the Provisional Government of Free India ("Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind"). The song was based on a highly Sanskritized Bengali poem Jana Gana Mana (the complete song) by Rabindranath Tagore.After Mr. Bose shifted to Southeast Asia from Germany in 1943, he with the help of Mumtaz Hussain, a writer with the Azad Hind Radio and Colonel Abid Hassan Saffrani of the INA, had rewritten Tagore’s "Jana Gana Mana" into Hindustani Subh Sukh Chain for being used as the national anthem. 
Netaji attached great significance to music as a source of inspiration for a force that was being prepared to fight till the finish. Netaji came down to the then INA broadcasting station at the Cathay Building in Singapore and asked Capt.Ram Singh Thakur to compose music for a song translated from Rabindra Nath Tagore's original Bengali score. He asked him to give the song a martial tune that would not put people to sleep but awaken those who were sleeping. India attained Independence on August 15, 1947, and the next morning Jawaharlal Nehru unfurled the Tricolour on the ramparts of the Red Fort and addressed the nation. It was on this occasion that Capt.Ram Singh Thakur was especially invited to play the tune of "Qaumi Tarana" of the INA along with the members of his orchestra group.
History.
During the, the song Vande Mataram was frequently sung at protest meetings. At the proclamation of the Provisional Government of Free India in Singapore in October 1943, Vande Mataram was sung by the crowd. Muslims were, however, not comfortable with the expressly Hindu metaphors used in the song, and disliked the anti-Muslim tenor of the book, Anandamath, in which it had been first published. The leaders of the INA in Singapore were aware of this problem, and hoped that Subhas Chandra Bose, the head of the INA and the Provisional Government, would settle it. Lakshmi Sahgal, an active INA member, favoured the selection of Jana Gana Mana, which was composed by Rabindranath Tagore and had been sung at sessions of the Indian National Congress. She arranged to have it sung at a women's meeting attended by Bose. Bose was taken by the song, which he thought was truly nationally representative. He did not, however, like the fact that the song was in Sanskritized Bengali and commissioned a free translation in Hindustani.
The translation, "Subh Sukh Chain", was written by Capt. Abid Ali, and its score composed by Ram Singh Thakur. It took Vande Mataram's place as the official national anthem of the Provisional Government, and was sung at all meetings, including at the final assembly before Bose's departure. It is sometimes considered a Hindi version of the national anthem of India, "Jana Gana Mana", though its meaning varies from the latter and it is therefore not a true translation.
On 24 Jan 1950, the then President of India Dr. Rajendra Prasad announced the final decision that Jana Gana Mana would be the national anthem of India, a choice determined by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose on 2 November 1941 and played as the national anthem of free India first time on 11 September 1942 at Hamburg.

Its female counterpart is the Taipei First Girls' High School.
History.
Jianguo High School was the first public high school in Taiwan. Except for a short period following the Chinese Civil War, the school has been an all-boys high school. The red brick building was built in 1909 during Japanese rule and is considered one of Taipei's historical buildings. Originally called Taipei First Boys School, it was renamed in 1946 (along with Taipei Second Boys School) so that the two names would spell out the phrase "successfully establish a country" (建國成功), thus naming them Jianguo High School and Chenggong High School (成功中學). During Japanese rule, because Jianguo was reserved primarily for the Japanese while Taipei Second Boys School allowed entry for the Taiwanese. The two schools developed a competitive nature that persists to this day.

John Holland (poet)

John Holland (14 March 1794–28 December 1872) was an English poet and newspaper editor.
Life.
Holland was born in a cottage in the grounds of the ancient Sheffield Manor in Yorkshire and initially trained by his father to follow him as a maker of optical instruments. He was however a bookish young man who taught himself Latin and soon began publishing poems of his own. These eventually brought him to the notice of local poet James Montgomery, editor of the Sheffield Iris, who published both articles and poems of his in the paper, although commenting on the latter's 'inaccuracies and imperfections' and remarking that 'they would be twice as good if they were as short again'. In 1813 Holland had become a Sunday School teacher and turned his hand to composing religious poetry and hymns. Some five years later he was appointed as a secretary of the Sheffield Sunday School Union.
In 1819 Holland wrote a long topographical poem on Sheffield Park and sent it to Montgomery for corrections and suggestions. Previously his output had largely been anonymous or appeared under his initials; the poem now became the first book published under his name and was followed by another in 1821 on the 'plague village' of Eyam. That year too he published the narrative poem "The Cottage of Pella" in imitation of Montgomery's "The Wanderer of Switzerland". Another strong influence on him at this time was the poet Thomas Campbell. Holland's poem "The Rainbow" (1820), published at the same time as one on the same subject by Campbell, was frequently anthologised as the latter's. Following this, Holland took Campbell's "The Pleasures of Hope" as the model for his own "The Hopes of Matrimony" (1822). As well as subsequent productions, a good deal of poetry was also included in some of his prose works such as the serialised "The Old Arm Chair" (1823), his botanical work "Memoirs of the Rose" (1824) and his consideration of the crucifixion, "Cruciana" (1836). Since he continued to write at length on all occasions, readers have to mine such gems as are there from among much that is derivative and diffuse.
In 1825, Holland was appointed as editor of the "Sheffield Iris" newspaper by new owner John Blackwell. In 1832, he moved to Northumberland to edit the "Newcastle Courant", which Blackwell had bought, but returned to Sheffield in the new year and was elected curator of the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society, a position he held until his death. In 1835 he became co-editor of the "Sheffield Mercury", serving until the paper was closed down by its new owner in 1848. Throughout his journalistic life, he wrote numerous works on botany, geology, local history and topography, in addition to biographies and sermons.

Norfolk House, Basingstoke

Norfolk House was the headquarters of The Automobile Association from the mid-1990s until its closure in 2003. It was originally intended to replace Fanum House as the AA's HQ, but ultimately the building was not large enough to accommodate all Basingstoke-based employees and both buildings operated concurrently.
The building was purpose-built, and located at the Aldermaston Road roundabout, at the junction of the Basingstoke ring road and the A340. It consisted of three permanent structures, the main office block and car park, a technology centre, and the AA sports and social club/museum which featured squash courts and other sports facilities, and a bar on part of the first floor. There was also a security gatehouse and a petrol pump, used by AA employees to fill company vehicles.
The main building was above three levels of undercover car park. There were three floors, including the entrance (ground) floor. The ground floor featured a large reception area with marble floors, an employee cafeteria, and office wings on either side accessible to employees by swiping their ID card. The offices were constructed around internal garden areas. The upper floors were accessed by a curved, floating staircase, or by lift. Each floor had a circular balcony overlooking the reception area.
One side of the 2nd (top) floor was a plush executive suite, with very large glass offices for the AA Director-General and the other directors, executive washrooms, and meeting rooms. The AA boardroom with an anteroom was within this suite. The executive suite was not accessible to the majority of employees, as it required a special ID card access. There was also a dedicated executive catering facility, with its own dining rooms. These were used both by the directors on a day to day basis, and for entertaining guests from other motoring associations worldwide and commercial partners.
After the purchase of the AA by Centrica in 1999, various Centrica functions moved into the building, and it was used jointly by Centrica, British Gas and AA employees until its closure. The executive facilities were dispensed with. After it closed, the building stood empty for some time, until it was occupied by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company and renamed Lilly House.
AA Museum.
The AA Museum featured exhibits of AA memorabilia from over the years, everything from badges and signs to petrol pumps, many photographs, and vehicles including an AA-liveried Minivan, AA Land Rover and various motorcycles.
After the closure of Norfolk House, the museum was incorporated into the Milestones Museum in Basingstoke.

"We Need a Little Christmas" is a popular Christmas song originating from Jerry Herman's Broadway musical, "Mame", and first performed by Angela Lansbury in that 1966 production. 
In the musical, the song is performed after Mame has lost her fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and decides that she, her young nephew Patrick, and her two household servants "need a little Christmas now" to cheer them up. The original lyrics include the line, "But, Auntie Mame, it's one week past Thanksgiving Day now!" Since the time the song was written the phenomenon of Christmas creep has resulted in the normal holiday season beginning much earlier than it once did, which has led to more recent recordings changing the line to, "But, Auntie Mame, it's one week "from" Thanksgiving Day now!"

Moondust (video game)

Moondust is a 1983 generative music video game created for the Commodore 64 by virtual reality pioneer, Jaron Lanier. "Moondust" was programmed in 6502 assembly in 1982, and is widely considered the first art video game. "Moondust" has frequently been used as an art installation piece in museum exhibitions from Corcoran Gallery of Art's 1983 "ARTcade" to the Smithsonian's 2012 "The Art of Video Games". It has also been used by Lanier and others in papers and lectures as an example to demonstrate the unexpected ephemerality of digital data.
"Moondust" is also considered to be the first interactive music publication, and it sold quite successfully. With the profits from "Moondust" and additional funding from Marvin Minsky, Lanier formed VPL which would later go on to create the DataGlove and the DataSuit and to become one of the primary innovators of virtual-reality research and development throughout the 1980s.
Gameplay.
"Moondust"'s gameplay is characterized by graphical complexity, and the game features an abstract ambient score. The goal of the game is to cover the bullseye at the center of the screen with "moonjuice." To do this, the player controls spaceman Jose Scriabin (named in honor of synaesthetic composer Alexander Scriabin) as he drops a seed square and then moves around the screen in arcing paths to run over the seed, smearing it to cover the bullseye. As Jose travels, flight patterns of he and the bullet-shaped spaceships he must avoid are created and as they pass through the trails that are created, and as the moonjuice spreads and smears, the musical score is modified according to a generative algorithm. In-game scoring system assigns point-values according to an algorithm when the level is completed. Players start with three seeds but may acquire more if they have scored highly enough. The game has been compared to the works of Jeff Minter.
The game features 4 modes: Beginner, Evasive, Freestyle, and Spinsanity. In Beginner mode, the seeds that jose must smear remain in one position wherever they had been dropped. In Evasive mode, however, the seeds seek to evade Jose by rushing to the edge of the screen. Freestyle mode greatly increases the players control over Jose, removing the physical element of momentum to connect Jose's motions directly to the joystick controller's. In Spinsanity mode, the spaceships travel in a spiral pattern making smearing of the seed more difficult for the player.

Slander of Women Act 1891

The Slander of Women Act 1891 (54 & 55 Vict. c.51) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (as it then was).
Section 1.
Slander imputing unchastity or adultery to a female is actionable per se
This section provides that in an action for slander ("words spoken and published"), brought by a female plaintiff in respect of words that impute unchastity or adultery to her, it is not necessary for her to allege or prove that she has suffered special damage.
"Unchastity"
This expression is not confined to unchastity with a man. To call a woman a "lesbian" is to impute "unchastity" to her.
But a plaintiff may not recover more costs than damages unless there were reasonable grounds for bringing the action
However, the section then provides that in an action for slander made actionable by that section, a plaintiff may not be awarded more costs than damages, unless the judge certifies that "there was reasonable ground for bringing the action".
Republic of Ireland.
This section was replaced for the Republic of Ireland by section 16 of the Defamation Act 1961. The proviso was not reproduced.
Section 2.
This section provides that the Act may be cited as the Slander of Women Act 1891 and it does not apply to Scotland.
Repeal.
This Act was repealed for the Republic of Ireland on 1 January 1962. This Act is prospectively repealed for England and Wales by section 14(1) of the Defamation Act 2013.

18 USC 1203: Hostage Taking Act.
(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, whoever, whether inside or outside the United States, seizes or detains and threatens to kill, to injure, or to continue to detain another person in order to compel a third person or a governmental organization to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the person detained, or attempts or conspires to do so, shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life and, if the death of any person results, shall be punished by death or life imprisonment.
(b) It is not an offense under this section:
(c) As used in this section, the term “national of the United States” has the meaning given such term in section 101(a)(22) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(22)).

Marital coercion

Marital coercion is a defence to most crimes under English criminal law and under the criminal law of Northern Ireland. It is similar to duress. In 2014, the government announced the defence would be abolished.
Legislation.
What remains of the original common law defence of marital coercion is contained in section 47 of the Criminal Justice Act 1925:
Section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945 (c.15) (N.I.) is identical to the section cited above and applies to Northern Ireland.
Paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 to the Crimes Act 1900 makes provision for New South Wales.
Differences from duress.
While the defence of marital coercion has similarities to that of duress, it has significant differences:
Proposals for reform.
In 1977, the Law Commission recommended that the defence of marital coercion should be abolished altogether. They said that they did not consider it to be appropriate to modern conditions.
Example from the 18th Century.
In 1732 at the Old Bailey Mary Day was acquitted of theft committed in obedience to her husband. 
Outside Britain.
In the United States, the defense formerly existed in most jurisdictions. It has since been abolished in several states, including those adopting or influenced by the Model Penal Code, Section 2.09(3) of which expressly ends the presumption and abolishes the defense.

Leonard Fairclough & Son Ltd was a construction firm based in Adlington, Lancashire, England. It is most famous for accepting the contact to destroy the Euston Arch.
History.
The firm was founded by Leonard Fairclough, a stonemason in Adlington who established his business in 1883. Leonard's son, Leonard Miller Fairclough, joined the company and continued to run it during the First World War. From 1917, the company traded as Leonard Fairclough Limited. In 1927, Leonard Miller Fairclough became chairman of the company and retained this position until he retired in 1965. Sir Leonard was succeeded by Oswald Davies who took Fairclough from being a regional contractor to one of the most successful national contractors. Davies bought a number of well-known construction businesses including CV Buchan, Fram Group and Sir Lindsay Parkinson. Also in the 1960s, Fairclough entered the private housebuilding market with the acquisition of the Lancashire firm of RJ Barton and Tarrant Builders (noted for its ownership of Wentworth Golf Club. Fairclough Homes continued to trade under its own name after the formation of AMEC.
In 1982 Fairclough and William Press Group merged to form AMEC.
Projects.
The company specialised in bridge building. During the 1950s the company built 31 bridges in the Manchester area and bridges on the Preston by-pass which was the first motorway in England, later part of the M6. During this decade they laid the foundations for the Silver Jubilee Bridge between Runcorn and Widnes and constructed its carriageway. During the 1960s the company built parts of the M6 and M62 in consortium with Sir Alfred MacAlpine.
Fairclough built the bridges and MacAlpine the roads.

Magnet Kitchens

Magnet is a British kitchen retailer operating in over 200 locations across the UK supplying products under the Magnet and Magnet Trade brands. The company has over 2,000 employees and its headquarters are in Darlington, County Durham. Magnet was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but is now part of Nobia UK, a division of the Nobia group which is listed on the Swedish Stock Exchange.' The Nobia division also includes brands such as Gower, Hygena and Norema.
History.
Formation and Early Years.
Magnet was established in Bingley, West Yorkshire in 1918 by Tom Duxbury. Legend has it that Duxbury traded his horse for a firelighting company and named his new company Magnet after the horse. During the 1920s Magnet pioneered the mass production of joinery, door and window products and soon began supplying joinery components for major construction projects. New operations were opened in Keighley, Grays and Knaresborough to satisfy demand for the growing business.
1960s.
In 1960 the company opened its first branch in Bingley. This concept of the company having their own outlets quickly develops in other towns in the UK.
1970s.
Kitchen products were introduced in 1970 and soon after a new factory in Darlington was established to manufacture joinery and kitchen furniture. In 1975 Magnet became Britain’s largest manufacturer of joinery products with 115 branches. In 1975 Magnet merges with timber group Southern-Evans to form Magnet & Southerns. The combined business, following the merger, exceeded 200 branches.
1980s.
In 1984 Magnet & Southerns became a founder member of the FTSE-100 share index. The company continued to expand during the 1980s with new manufacturing sites in Rotherham, Thornton, Penrith, Burnley and Deeside opened together with the acquisition of the Thomas Easthams kitchen business. Seeing the growth of the burgeoning DIY sector, the company decided to move into the retail kitchen market and opened its first retail kitchen showrooms in 1985. In 1988 Magnet sold the Southern-Evans timber business in preparation for a £629m management buy out which took place the following year. Soon after difficulties in the UK economy led to a severe downturn in the housing market and a significant downturn in sales. Magnet, unable to pay its bankers, fought to remain cash positive to survive. In 1989 Tom Duxbury led a management buyout of the business. The buyout failed quite quickly and the banks took control of the business.
1990s.
In 1990 separate Retail and Trade divisions were established to maximize customer service for these very different market sectors. Factories in Easthams, Thornton, Burnley, Deeside, Gillingham and Lincoln were closed with work transferred to Darlington and Keighley. In 1994 Berisford acquired the company and planned to re-establish Magnet as the Number One Kitchen and Joinery company in the UK. The company’s financial performance stabilized but a lack of investment and a long running industrial dispute meant that the company did not see any significant growth.
2000s.
In 2001, Magnet was acquired by Nobia, a Swedish based kitchen company for £134m. Significant investments were made in the company with a multi million pound showroom refurbishment programme and the introduction of the Trade Concept, an initiative to grow the company’s market share in the trade channel. To support the increased demand for Magnet products, further investment was made in the Darlington site converting the manufacturing operation into a modern assemble to order facility.
Operations.
Magnet.
Magnet supplies kitchens to retail consumers via 170 showrooms. The company primarily targets the middle market and offers a wide variety of kitchen designs together with a comprehensive range of worktops, sinks & taps, electrical appliances and kitchen accessories. Other services offered include a home survey, free CAD planning, expert installation and a post installation visit. The company's Full Circle Service process guides customers throughout the kitchen buying process from design through to installation.
In 2003 Magnet's retail showroom concept won Best UK Retail Interior by Retail Interiors Magazine and has subsequently refurbished the majority of its estate in line with this footprint. Magnet was the first national kitchen retailer to achieve Trustmark accreditation, a scheme designed to drive out the in the home improvement sector. Trustmark provides customers with a two-year guarantee on installation and payment protection.
Magnet Trade.
Magnet Trade sells only to registered trade customers through its network of 187 branches. The majority of customers are local tradesmen such as joiners, builders and kitchen fitters. Magnet Trade also supplies organizations in the RSL sector such as Local Authorities and Housing Associations. Alongside a comprehensive kitchen offering (cabinets, appliances, worktops, sinks & taps), the company supplies a wide variety of joinery (Doors, Windows, Timber, Wood flooring, Hardware). Products are supplied from stock held on site in the branch warehouse. Free kitchen planning, made to measure timber window ordering and local delivery services are also offered.
Magnet Trade has a separate in-store environment and brand identity, in order to clearly differentiate it from the retail business.
Mixed Sites.
The majority of Magnet branches have both a trade and retail presence in the same building. There are separate entrances for each different customer group which are clearly designated.

Southern Cemetery, Manchester

Southern Cemetery, Manchester is a large municipal cemetery in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Greater Manchester, England, three miles south of Manchester city centre: it was opened in 1879 and is owned and administered by Manchester City Council. It is the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom and second largest in Europe.
Manchester Southern Cemetery originally occupied 40 hectare plot of land that cost Manchester Corporation £38,340 in 1872. Its cemetery buildings were designed by architect H J Paull and its layout attributed to the city surveyor, James Gascoigne Lynde. The cemetery opened on 9 October 1879 and had mortuary chapels for Anglicans, Nonconformists, and Roman Catholics linked by an elliptical drive and a Jewish chapel at the west corner of the site. The original cemetery is registered by English Heritage in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens for its historic interest and the mortuary chapels and other structures are listed buildings. The site was expanded by the purchase of 36 hectares on the opposite side of Nell Lane in 1926, the first section of which opened in 1943. Some of the 1926 purchase has been developed for housing and some is occupied by allotments.
The main area of the cemetery is located to the north of Barlow Moor Road and to the west of the A5103 Princess Road; its northwards extension is on Nell Lane bought by the council in 1926. Its layout complements the original cemetery. A war memorial commemorates Allied servicemen who died in the World Wars.
Structures.
The grade II listed registrar's office near the entrance gateway was built in 1879 in the neo-Gothic style in sandstone with slate roofs. Three service chapels are located in Southern Cemetery, only one of which is currently used for funeral services. The remaining two chapels are semi-derelict.
A remembrance lodge was created in the cemetery, opened on 1 October 2008. It is situated at the main entrance on Barlow Moor Road and is for the use of families and friends wishing to pay their respects and remember loved ones.
Immediately adjacent to the northwest corner of the cemetery on Barlow Moor Road is Manchester Crematorium which opened in 1892, the second in the United Kingdom.
Notable burials and monuments.
Manchester's first multi-millionaire, industrialist and philanthropist John Rylands, is buried there. The Rylands memorial is the grandest in the cemetery, although a considerable part of the original structure was removed circa 1927 and the bronze railings were stolen circa 1967: his widow Enriqueta's ashes lie in the vault below. The graves of some of those associated with the firm of Rylands are nearby, including those of Reuben Spencer and William Carnelley.
Near the entrance to its grounds the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) erected a memorial stone to 14 Commonwealth servicemen of the First World War who were cremated here, while 177 servicemen and women who were cremated during the Second World War are listed on the screen wall at the cemetery's Second World War war graves plot. Two holders of the Victoria Cross - Major Henry Kelly (VC) (World War I award, died 1960) and Colour Sergeant John Prettyjohns (Crimean War award and the first to a Royal Marine, died 1887) - are buried in the cemetery.
A Grade II listed monument in the form of a white marble Celtic cross in the centre of the cemetery commemorates Sir John Alcock who piloted the first non-stop trans-Atlantic aircraft flight from Newfoundland to Clifden Ireland in June 1919.
Sir Matt Busby, manager of Manchester United F.C. is buried in the cemetery, alongside his wife Lady Jean Busby who died in December 1988 just over five years before him. Billy Meredith (1874-1958), who played for Manchester City and Manchester United, is buried in the cemetery as is Willie Satinoff, a racecourse owner who died in the Munich air disaster in February 1958 in which Busby was badly injured but survived.
Stretford-born artist L. S. Lowry was buried next to his parents in 1976. Factory Records founder Tony Wilson is also buried there; his coffin carries the catalogue number FAC501; a headstone designed by Peter Saville and Ben Kelly was installed in October 2010.
Also buried in the cemetery are the remains of Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans; two of five victims of the Moors murders in the early 1960s.

The Kugaryuagmiut are a geographically defined Copper Inuit band in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut, on the mainland, in Kitikmeot Region. According to Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson's 1908-1912 ethnographic journals, they numbered about 25 at the time. In the summer, they hunted in the region of the Kugaryuak River, which flows into the Coronation Gulf, where they subsisted during the winter, the same as other Copper Inuit of that region.

Mark Scheffel

Mark Scheffel is a state legislator in the U.S. state of Colorado. First elected to the Colorado State Senate as a Republican in 2008, Scheffel represents Senate District 4, which encompasses Douglas County: including Castle Rock, Larkspur, Parker, Franktown, and Castle Pines. He is also the Assistant Minority Leader for the Colorado Senate Republican Caucus.
Biography.
Mark Scheffel earned a bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Denver in 1982, then later a J.D. from John Marshall Law School in 1987 and an LL.M. in tax law from the New York University School of Law in 1998. A practicing business and tax attorney since 1989, he has worked as an attorney for his own firm, Reid and Scheffel, since 1993. In 2003 he was named Elbert County Attorney, a post that he held through 2008.
Active in the Douglas County Republican Party, he has served as a precinct committeeperson, district captain, chaired the Douglas County Republican GOTV effort and the bylaws committee of the Colorado Republican Party, and was chairman of the Douglas County Republican Party for two terms, from 2004 to 2007.
Scheffel has also served on the board of the Skycliff Stroke Center and on the citizen advisory board for The Wildlife Experience. He was a founding incorporator and charter director of Champion Bank. Scheffel and his wife Cheri reside with their four children in Parker, Colorado.
Scheffel's house was foreclosed on at 9791 Summit Ridge Place, Parker, CO 80138 in 2014.
Legislative career.
2008 Election.
After incumbent Senator Tom Wiens announced in April 2008 that he would not run for a second term, Scheffel announced his candidacy for the seat; he had briefly sought the seat in 2004 before Wiens declared his candidacy. Scheffel defeated three other contenders — Ed Brewer, Mark Vanderbilt, and Randy Reed — to take 65 percent of the vote at the Republican district assembly in May, the only candidate to qualify for the ballot by the assembly process. Financial advisor and Air Force veteran Bob Denny petitioned onto the Republican primary ballot. During the primary campaign, Scheffel touted his experience as a tax attorney and familiarity as an asset in the legislature, but was outraised by Denny, who took in about $24,000 to Scheffel's $18,000. Scheffel was also endorsed by retiring U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo. Mark Scheffel ultimately defeated Bob Denney in the contested Republican primary in August, taking 65 percent of votes cast.
Scheffel faced Democrat Joe Alsup in the November 2008 general election. Alsup's candidacy was endorsed by the "Denver Post", but Scheffel won with 68 percent of the popular vote.
2009 Legislative Session.
In November 2008, Scheffel was named to a special legislative Committee on Job Creation and Economic Growth, tasked with developing recommendations on bolstering Colorado's economy before the 2009 legislative session. Stemming from this interim committee, Senator Scheffel set his focus on bills during the 2009 legislative session regarding exemptions from property taxation for business personal property: SB09-085 created a task force to study the possibility, and HB09-1068 would have created such an exemption. Senate Bill 85 successfully passed through both the House and Senate before being signed by Governor Bill Ritter (politician); however, House Bill 1068 failed to pass through the House Finance committee before being postponed indefinitely.
2010 Legislative Session.
During this legislative session Senator Scheffel sponsored several bills, one of which focused on increasing the transparency in the use of gifts, grants, and donations to fund programs by state agencies. HB 10-1178 required that any state agencies that received such gifts would have to make annual reports to the General Assembly. The bill successfully passed through the legislature before it was sent to the Governor and signed to be enacted.
In addition, following the 2010 legislative session Scheffel was honored with the James T. Brubaker Legislative Award.
2011 Legislative Session.
In 2011, Scheffel was elected to act as the Assistant Minority Leader for the Colorado Senate Republican Caucus, following Senator Kopp’s retirement that same year. He also sponsored several bills that year, most notably regarding business personal property taxes: SB11-026 and HB11-1141. However, both bills were killed in the Democratic-controlled Senate, and were postponed indefinitely in committee.
In addition, Scheffel was honored as the Independent Bankers 2011 Champion of Main Street Colorado Award, which recognizes state lawmakers who “understand, value, and champion local community banks and small businesses.” 
2012 Legislative Session.
During the 2012 session, Senator Scheffel was appointed to the Finance and Judiciary Committees. In addition, he serves on the Legislative Council due to his role as Assistant Minority Leader in the Republican Caucus.
An important piece of legislation Scheffel sponsored this year was SB12-157 which focused on the regulation of telecommunication services while also enacting the “Telecommunications Modernization Act of 2012”. The bill, sponsored by a bipartisan group of legislators, sought to reduce service fees and increase broadband service to rural areas. Senator Scheffel said that the bill was “the result of more than a year of work on the part of the legislators and other government officials and agencies. The bill was assigned to the Senate Business, Labor, and Technology Committee, where it was passed and sent on the Senate Appropriations. However, in the Appropriations Committee, they could not agree on terms, and therefore the bill failed to pass and was postponed indefinitely.
2012 Election.
During the 2012 elections, Scheffel faced no opposition during the primaries. In the general election, he opposed Democratic candidate Holly Gorman and Libertarian candidate Chris Grundermann, both of whom he defeated with 64.3% of the vote.
2013 Legislative Session.
Senator Scheffel was re-elected by the Senate Republican Caucus to serve as the Assistant Minority Leader for the 2013 legislative session. He was appointed to the Senate Education Committee, as well as the Legislative Council.

USS Wanaloset (1865)

USS "Wanaloset", also spelled USS "Wanalosett", was a proposed United States Navy screw sloop-of-war or steam frigate that appears never to have been laid down.
"Wanaloset" was a wooden-hulled bark-rigged (or ship-rigged) "Contoocook"-class screw sloop-of-war or steam frigate with a single funnel scheduled to be built at Baltimore, Maryland, by the firm of Hazelhurst and Wiegard. Although carried on the Navy List of January 1865, she was one of six units of her class that were cancelled; her keel apparently never was laid down and her hull certainly never was built. Her engines, however, were completed, and they were installed in the screw steamer .
The name "Wanaloset" was dropped from the Navy List about 1867.

Nanchangosaurus

Nanchangosaurus is an extinct genus of large aquatic reptile native to the middle Triassic of China. It was named after the area in China, Nanchang, where it was found. It was about three feet (one meter) in length, and probably fed on fish or used its long jaws to probe for aquatic invertebrates. It resembled the ichthyosaurs in build, and may be related to them.
Anatomy.
"Nanchangosaurus" resembled a cross between an ichthyosaur and a crocodilian. It had a fusiform body, similar to a dolphin or an ichthyosaur, paddle-like limbs; with forelimbs being larger than hindlimbs, and a crocodilian-like tail for swimming through the water. It had bony scutes on its back, like an alligator, but had a long snout filled with teeth, like an ichthyosaur or a river dolphin.
Classification.
"Nanchangosaurus" is a member of the Hupehsuchia, a group that includes the very similar "Hupehsuchus". In fact, the two may be congeneric. There are a few differences between the two species. "Hupehsuchus" had heavier armor and more divided ridge spines than the two. Other than "Hupehsuchus", there is little else known about "Nanchangosaurus" relatives. They have sometimes been referred to as ancestors of the ichthyosaurs, because of their streamlined shape, long jaws, and paddle-like hands, as well as the discovery of polydactyly in the fins of "Hupehsuchus"; just like the ichthyosaurs. However, a gap in the skulls suggests that they may be related to archosaurs instead. Some people even put them in the Eosuchia, a group of early diapsid reptiles.

Joyce Foster

Joyce Foster 
(born February 13, 1944) is a state legislator in the U.S. state of Colorado. Elected to the Colorado State Senate as a Democrat in 2008, Foster represents Senate District 35, which encompasses southeastern Denver, Colorado.
Legislative career.
2008 election.
Joyce Foster defeated State Representative Alice Borodkin in the contested Democratic primary in August, taking 71 percent of votes cast.
Foster faced Republican Bob Lane in the November 2008 general election. Foster's candidacy was endorsed by the "Denver Post", and she won the race with 68 percent of the vote.
2009 legislative session.
For the 2009 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Foster was named to seats on the Senate Business Committee and the Senate Local Government and Energy Committee, where she will serve as vice-chair. 
During the 2009 session, Foster introduced legislation to require the Colorado Division of Wildlife to place a higher priority on predator control, after increasing numbers of coyote attacks south of Denver. The bill, however, was killed in committee due to concerns over its vagueness. Foster also introduced a resolution in support of the nation of Israel that was criticized by peace activists as reflecting a one-sided perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In May 2010 it was alleged that Sen. Foster had introduced an amendment to a bill concerning the registered sex offenders. Multiple news media have reported that Julian Newman, Sen. Foster's brother-in-law, was involved with a consensual adult 21+ relationship with a client he was paid to treat.
Retirement.
The 2011 reapportionment process that followed the 2010 census resulted in Foster's home being included in the same senate district as Pat Steadman's. Both Steadman and Foster are Democratic incumbents. Foster announced that she would defer to Steadman and not seek reelection in 2012.

Silvia Stroescu

Silvia Alexandra Stroescu (born May 8, 1985 in Bucharest, Romania) is a Romanian artistic gymnast. She is an Olympic, world, and European gold medalist with the team.
Early life and career.
She was one of the most successful junior gymnast of her generation. The major achievements of her junior years were the win of the prestigious Top Gym Trophy (1998) and of four medals (two gold and two silver) at the 2000 Junior European Gymnastics Championships. At these championships she won gold on floor (9.725), tied for gold on balance beam with Sabina Cojocar (9.6), earned a share of the Romanian team's silver medal, and placed second all-around (37.973) behind teammate Sabina Cojocar. Initially, Stroescu did not qualify for the all around event due to the two-per-country rule, having achieved the third qualification score among her teammates. But, in the all around final she replaced Carmen Ionescu who withdrew in her favor.
Senior career.
Her senior debut at a major international event was at the 2001 World Championships. Here she contributed to Romania’s sixth team title by competing on beam and uneven bars. Individually, she placed eleventh all around and seventh on floor. Later that year she won the mixed pair Swiss Cup event together with Marian Drǎgulescu. 
In the period 2002-2003 she did not make the team for major international events but she competed at the national championships and at some friendly international competitions.
After being sidelined for two years she joined the team for the 2004 European Championships where she contributed to the team title. Just weeks before the 2004 Olympic games she decided to give up gymnastics being disappointed for not making the Olympic team. However, her disappointment was short lived and she returned to replace injured Aura Munteanu. Stroescu went to Athens and was part of an immensely successful Romanian women's gymnastics team (four golds, one silver and one bronze in six events) that also included Oana Ban, Monica Roșu, Cătălina Ponor, Daniela Sofronie and Alexandra Eremia. Though the team members were less experienced than most of their rivals, the Romanians hit every routine to take the team gold by a comfortable margin. World champions USA were second, and the Russians, led by Svetlana Khorkina, took the bronze.

Entrance Road (Devils Tower National Monument)

The Entrance Road at Devils Tower National Monument, officially known as Wyoming Highway 110, is a scenic road that provides the approach to the Devil's Tower eminence, affording planned views to arriving visitors.
Route description.
The Wyoming Highway 110 designation is a short roadway that starts its at Wyoming Highway 24 and travels west to the Devils Tower National Monument Entrance. Mileposts along WYO 110 increase from east to west.
The entrance road is a long, two-lane, asphalt paved road that spans the distance between the Entrance Station and the visitor parking area located just west of Devil's Tower. The road provides access to the monument's primary developed areas, such as headquarters and visitor center.
History.
The road was originally constructed in 1917 with an eight percent grade and a ford at the Belle Fourche River. A bridge was built in 1928, and the road was extensively altered in the 1930s with labor from the Civilian Conservation Corps, improving grades and alignments. CCC camp NM-1 remained at Devil's Tower from 1935 to 1938. A complete loop was planned by the National Park Service Engineering Division in 1927, but was never carried out. The entrance road at Devils Tower is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an example of close integration with the natural surroundings.
Much of the CCC work involved realignment of the existing road and the careful obliteration of the old alignment, using young trees and sod stockpiled during construction of the new alignment.

Steven Levitsky

Steven Levitsky is a noted comparative political scientist, and has been a tenured Professor of Government and Social Studies in Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences since May 8, 2008. He specializes in Latin America, and particularly in Peru and Argentina.
Education.
Levitsky received a B.A. in Political Science (with honors) from Stanford University in 1990, and a Ph.D in Political Science from the UC Berkeley in 1999.
Academia.
Career.
Levitsky is the John L. Loeb Associate Professor of the Social Sciences at Harvard from 2004, he was an assistant professor at Harvard from 2000 to 2003.
He now serves as an adviser for two Harvard student organizations, the Harvard Organization for Latin America and the Harvard College Project for Sustainable Development; and also serves as the Advisory Council on POLITAI Civil Association, dedicated to research in Political Science and Government, formed by students of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Perú.
Work.
Levitsky is known for his work with Lucan Way on Competitive Authoritarian Regimes, which are government types in which a single leader or party dominates, but where the opposition in theory could come to power through elections. Under such a system, the incumbents almost always retain power, because they control and tend to use the state to squelch opposition, arresting or intimidating opponents, controlling media coverage, or tampering with election
results; Russia under Vladimir Putin is considered a textbook example of this system. Levitsky is also an expert on the Nicaraguan revolution.
Personal life.
Levitsky lives with his wife and daughter in Brookline, Massachusetts. Levitsky served as a visitant Professor at PUCP in Lima, Peru.

<doc id="20140100" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20140100" title="Representation of women in Athenian tragedy">
Representation of women in Athenian tragedy

The representation of women in Athenian tragedy was performed exclusively by men and it is likely (although the evidence is not conclusive) that it was performed solely for men as well.
In a society that valued women’s silence, their predominance in the most public of Athenian art-forms constitutes a paradox. Only one of the surviving 32 plays has no female characters: Sophocles' "Philoctetes". Female tragic choruses also outnumber the male choruses by twenty-one to ten.
Cultural stereotype.
Macaria, in the "Heracleidae" states that "for a woman, silence and self control are best." The philosopher Xenophon thought females possessed the positive traits of 'vigilance' and 'love for infants'. However Xenophon reflects the Greek fear of these 'others', highlighting their irrationality, religious fervour and sexual passion. Aristotle went further, stating that women were deformed, incomplete males, designed to be subservient to men.
As a result women had their freedom restricted and were believed to have lived in separate areas to men. In a speech recorded in the Lysias Orations 3.6, a speaker seeks to convey his opponent’s licentiousness by telling how he trespassed into "the women’s rooms where my sister and my nieces were – women who have always lived so decently that they are ashamed to be seen even by relatives." Sheila Murnaghan argues that "it is no accident that what little evidence we do have for actual Athenian women comes largely from courtroom speeches or medical treatises, genres brought into being by conflict and disease."
In Ancient Greece, a woman was viewed as a passive conduit of male fertility,on long term loan by her father. Marriage was an unequal relationship, whereby the husband owned the children and didn’t have the same obligation toward sexual fidelity that the wife had. 
The playwright Euripides presents two very different reactions to this cultural norm. Firstly, his female protagonist Alcestis, represents the "perfect wife" sacrificing her own life, so her husband, Admetos, can live. Yet as Blondell points out this "female fame is hard won, even oxymoronic" as her own marriage kills her.
It is also interesting to note that the most important relationships within this play are actually between the men. Heracles goes to the underworld not for Alcestis, but to honour his male friend’s hospitality. Admetos goes against the promise he made to his wife, so as to obey his male friendship. "Alcestis drops out," Easterling argues, "to facilitate the interaction between the men."
In contrast, however, Euripides Medea breaks the marital conventions, choosing her husband herself and reacting against his infidelity by breaking the female oath and killing her children. "In a sense," Blondell argues, "every bride was a stranger in a strange land. And every married woman was dependent on her husband."
Theatrical themes.
The problem of male absence.
In the surviving plays, women become tragic figures by men’s absence or mismanagement.
Sophocles' Antigone takes action after her uncle Creon refuses to bury her brother Polynices. In Aeschylus' "Oresteia", Clytemnestra takes power in Argos because her husband Agamemnon has been away fighting at Troy for ten years. Clytemnestra's later murder of him is motivated by a range of male abuses. Medea becomes the aggressor when her husband Jason plans a new more advantageous marriage.
The public versus the private.
There is also a theme running through the plays based on the setting. Performed in open-air theatres, Classical Athenian tragedy was set outside the private sphere of the home. Indeed Euripides was notorious for "taking the streets, the bedroom, into tragedy" and thereby reducing its remoteness.
In "Hippolytus", Phaedra first appears, carried out of the house by her servants, demanding open air, in order to declare her love for her stepson and thus the spiral of tragedy to unwind. In Aeschylus' "Oresteia", Clytemnestra in the first play of the trilogy orders her husband's death outside, while in the second play, her son Orestes forces her into the house to be killed. It is only in the third play, which is in an entirely public space of the court of Areopagus, that order is restored. "This three play sequence," Bushnell argues, "which begins when a self-willed woman takes matters into her own hands, finally achieves closure as figures representing women are removed from view.'
The female warrior.
A woman displaying traits of the heroic Grecian male was not portrayed in a positive light. Euripides' Medea is the prime example. Her name in Greek means "cunning" and is also the word for the Persians (the Greek’s greatest foreign enemy).
Most of the time, a woman is full of fear
Ruby Blondell argues that Medea displays stereotypically male attributes that the Greeks held as positive. Possessing courage, intelligence, decisiveness, resourcefulness, power, independence, the ability to conceive and carry out a plan effectively, as well as the art of rhetoric. The nurse even likens her to a rock of the sea, as Patroclus famously does to Homer’s Achilles in the epic poem "The Iliad". Yet Medea, similarly to Aeschylus’ Clytemnestra, another "woman with a heart of manly counsel" were not admired but portrayed as "Cruella de Vil" type characters.
So the declaration "that a noble man ought either to live with honour, or die with honour" does not apply to women.
Public reaction.
In Plato’s Republic, Socrates thought the impersonation of inferiors, such as women and slaves, that drama utilised was morally harmful. Socrates was also worried "about the ethical damage caused by the representation of 'womanish' emotions in tragedy." Plato unsurprisingly excludes poetry, embodied by the figure of a woman, from his ideal city-state.
The Athenians however thought it important to place on "display those feature of human experience that inspire terror, sorrow and rejection, and they accomplished their mission by giving women visibility and a powerful voice."

The Bicycles

The Bicycles are a Canadian indie pop quartet from Toronto composed of Matt Beckett, Drew Smith, Dana Snell, and Andrew Scott (formerly of The Meligrove Band).
History.
Beckett and Smith recorded the acoustic EP "As Is" in 2000 before recruiting Scott, Snell, and Randy Lee to grow the band to a five-piece. Six years later they released "The Good The Bad and The Cuddly" in 2006 with Fuzzy Logic Recordings. Recorded with Dan Bryk, Robert Sledge and José Miguel Contreras, the album features complex, lush arrangements with a lo-fi sound. The band supported the album with a tour of Canada and The United States, including a supporting slot with The Boy Least Likely To in 2006. In 2007, they released an interactive board game based upon the album.
2008 saw Lee leave to play violin with The Hylozoists. The now four-piece rejoined Contreras to record and release their second album, "Oh No, It's Love". Featuring songwriting and lead vocals by all four members, the album spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Canadian campus radio chart. 
"Spin" magazine noted the band in their February 2008 issue in their City Guide to Toronto, claiming "If Wes Anderson ever cottoned on to (The Bicycles) swooning chamber pop, which draws from the Kinks and the Beach Boys, he'd soak his scarf with tears of joy."
In March 2009, the band announced an indefinite hiatus. After playing a few unannounced shows in early 2012, the band reformed with the full original line-up and played a selection of new material to critical acclaim. The band released their latest album, "Stop Thinking So Much " in April 2013.

ARAS (Lithuania)

The ARAS or Lithuanian Police Anti-terrorist Operations Unit ARAS () is a separate specialized police unit established in 1991. At first, ARAS's main purpose was to suppress organized crime and the bandit groups that were freely operating in Lithuania. In addition, they handled riot suppression, peace keeping, and escort. In December 2004 the unit was admitted into the Atlas Network of special counter-terrorist police units of the European Union countries. 
Structure.
ARAS consists of a:
The unit also has specialized reconnaissance, negotiation, sniper, climber and diver groups that are necessary to carry out the main functions ascribed to the unit.
Functions.
The main functions of ARAS are to:
Equipment and training.
ARAS is provided with modern arms and equipment for successful work. There are modern weapons with special sights, night vision equipment, thermo visors, equipment for explosives search, modern equipment for divers, special armour-plated vests, shields and helmets among them.
Nevertheless, all weapons are worthless without competent people. Currently the nucleus of the unit is made up of highly qualified combatants, who have acquired physical and psychological training and are prepared for working under extreme circumstances. Much experience was gained when the officers participated in several courses for special unit response to critical situations organized by the US State Department, which were included in the international program for the war against terrorism. During these exercises they showed good preparation, and received a high evaluation from the organizers of the courses. Officers from the unit participated in many other courses organized not only in the USA, but also by law enforcement institutions of other countries.
Equipment.
ARAS operators use modern western oriented equipment from countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Italy, UK and the USA. Most of their weapons and equipment is German.
Among many weapons used in ARAS there are such models as:
H&K MP-5/A5/SD6/KA4, H&K G36C/K, H&K 69 A1, Steyer AUG A1/P, SIG SG 551-2 SWAT, Sig Sauer P226, Glock 17, Benelli M4 Super 90, PGM Ultima Ratio Intervention, PGM Ultima Ratio Hecate II, Accuracy International AW F, ...
Training.
Candidates are selected on the basis of "Delta Force" program criteria. Candidates have their biography's thoroughly checked, the age requirement is not younger than 18 and no older than 30 years, priority is given to non-smokers, 5 years of work experience in any other police branch would be advantage. Those who make it through this barrier have to grapple with the psychological and intelligence tests and have to pass the physical preparation check, especially endurance and emotional stability. Only 2-3 men a year make the cut into this elite group.

Patellar subluxation syndrome

Patellar Subluxation Syndrome, also known as Patellar instability, or Unstable Kneecap is an injury that is concerned with the kneecap. Patellar subluxation is more common than patellar dislocation and is just as disabling.
Here, the patella repetitively subluxates and places strain on the medial restraints and excessive stress/tension on the patellofemoral joint. Patellar Subluxation can be caused by osseous abnormalities, such as incorrect articulation of the femoral groove with the patella, trochlear dysplasia, or patella alta, which is a distance of greater than 20 mm between the tibial tubercle and the trochlear groove. It can also result from soft-tissue abnormalities, such as a torn medial patellofemoral ligament, or a weakened vastus medialis obliquus. Symptoms are regulated by the amount of activity. Such pain is commonly caused by running and jumping sports and activities that place large forces on the patellofemoral joint. 
Symptoms usually include:
Patellar subluxation was once thought to occur mainly in women, due to the frequency of genu valgum and lax ligaments. However, now the frequency of this condition in any athletic person, man or woman, is apparent.

L'envie d'aimer

"L'envie d'aimer" is a 2000 song recorded by French-born singer Daniel Lévi and the troupe of "The Ten Commandments". Released as first single from the album "Les Dix Commandements" on June 2000, the song was a smash hit and the most successful single from the musical. The song is currently among the biggest selling singles of all time in France.
Background and structure.
The album version of the song is extended (6:28) and contains many choirs from the troupe. Written and composed by Pascal Obispo, Lionel Florence, who had already several number-one hits in France such as "Savoir aimer" and "Tu ne m'as pas laissé le temps", Serge Guirao, who had written for Art Mengo, the song was very moving. An expert of French charts made this analysis of the song : "With the text of the verses, spaced out and almost minimal, [Lévi] murmurs, he speaks in a low voice, he sings hardly, a moderation which the sweetness of wind instruments blows him. And it is not due to a lack of voice : this one, disturbing of power and color, asks only to spread and the vowels of the tune are there for this."
Chart performances and awards.
In France, the single failed to reach #1, but went straight to #2 on June 10, 2002 and stayed there for six weeks, being unable to disloge Yannick's hit "Ces Soirées-là". The song remained for 30 weeks in the top ten and 51 weeks on the chart (top 100), which is to date one of the records in terms of chart trajectory. In Belgium (Wallonia), the song peaked at #2 for six weeks and fell off the chart (top 40) after 36 weeks, 25 of them in the top ten.
To date, the song is the 47th best-selling single of all time in France.
In 2001, the song was awarded 'Original song of the year' at the Victoires de la Musique.
Cover versions.
The song was covered by Éric Morena in 2003 on the album " Retour gagnant" which was composed of cover versions by famous 1980s artists. The same year, the song was covered by Julien Clerc, Patrick Fiori, Catherine Lara and Liane Foly on Les Enfoirés' album "La Foire des Enfoirés". In 2002, Céline Dion released a version in English under the title "The Greatest Reward" on her album "A New Day Has Come". In 2006, the song was used as soundtrack of the 2006 film "Comme t'y es belle !". In 2007, Greek French television presenter Nikos Aliagas recorded a Greek version of the song with Elena Paparizou, for his Greek duet album titled "Rendez-Vous". The track was released as a single, accompanied by a music video. In 2013, Pascal Obispo covered the song on his best of "Millésimes".

<doc id="20140244" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20140244" title="Jadad scale">
Jadad scale

The Jadad scale, sometimes known as Jadad scoring or the Oxford quality scoring system, is a procedure to independently assess the methodological quality of a clinical trial. It is the most widely used such assessment in the world, and as of 2008, its seminal paper has been cited in over 3000 scientific works.
The Jadad scale is named after Alejandro Jadad-Bechara, a Colombian physician who worked as a Research Fellow at the Oxford Pain Relief Unit, Nuffield Department of Anaesthetics, at the University of Oxford. Jadad felt that the randomised controlled trial was of great importance for the advancement of medical science, describing it in a 2007 book as "one of the simplest, most powerful and revolutionary forms of research". He and his team outlined their views of the effectiveness of blinding on published studies in a 1996 paper in the "Journal of Controlled Clinical Trials". An appendix to the paper described a scale allocating trials a score of between zero (very poor) and five (rigorous).
Background.
Clinical trials are conducted for the purpose of collecting data on the efficacy of medical treatments. The treatment might be, for example, a new drug, a medical device, a surgical procedure, or a preventative regime. Clinical trial protocols vary considerably depending on the nature of the treatment under investigation, but typically in a controlled trial researchers gather a group of volunteers and subject some to the test treatment, while giving the others either no treatment (known as a placebo), or an established treatment for comparison. After a defined time period, the patients in the test group are assessed for health improvements in comparison with the control group.
However, trials can vary greatly in quality. Methodological errors such as poor blinding or poor randomisation allow factors such as the placebo effect or selection bias to adversely affect the results of a trial.
Randomisation.
Randomisation is a process to remove potential distortion of statistical results arising from the manner in which the
trial is conducted, in particular in the selection of subjects. Studies have indicated, for example, that nonrandomised trials are more likely to show a positive result for a new treatment than for an established conventional one.
Blinding.
The importance of scientific controls to limit factors under test is well established. However, it is also important that none of those involved in a clinical trial, whether the researcher, the subject patient or any other involved parties, should allow their own prior expectations to affect reporting of results. The placebo effect is known to be a confounding factor in trials; affecting the ability of both patients and doctors to report accurately on the clinical outcome. Experimental blinding is a process to prevent bias, both conscious and subconscious, skewing results.
Blinding frequently takes the form of a placebo, an inactive dummy that is indistinguishable from the real treatment. Blinding can however be difficult to achieve in some trials, for example, surgery or physical therapy. Poor blinding can exaggerate the perceived effects of treatment, particularly if any such effects are small. Blinding should be appropriate to the study, and is ideally double blind, wherein neither the patient nor doctor is aware of whether they are in the control or test group, eliminating any such psychological effects from the study.
Withdrawals and dropouts.
Withdrawals and dropouts are those patients who fail to complete a course of treatment, or fail to report back on its outcome to the researchers. The reasons for doing so might be varied: the individuals may have moved away, abandoned the course of treatment, or died. Whatever the reason, the attrition rate can skew results of a study, particularly for those subjects who ceased treatment due to perceived inefficacy. In smoking cessation studies, for example, it is routine to consider all dropouts as failures.
Jadad questionnaire.
In an appendix to their 1996 paper, Jadad "et al." published a three-point questionnaire that formed the basis for a Jadad score. Each question was to be answered with either a "yes" or a "no". Each "yes" would score a single point, each "no" zero points; there were to be no fractional points. The Jadad team stated that they expected it should take no longer than ten minutes to score any individual paper. The questions were as follows:
To receive the corresponding point, an article should describe the number of withdrawals and dropouts, in each of the study groups, and the underlying reasons. Additional points were given if:
Points would however be "deducted" if:
A paper reporting a clinical trial could therefore receive a Jadad score of between zero and five. The Jadad scale is sometimes described as a five-point scale, though there are only three questions.
Uses.
Jadad scores may be used in a number of ways:
Criticism.
Critics have charged that the Jadad scale is flawed, being over-simplistic and placing too much emphasis on blinding, and can show low consistency between different raters. Furthermore, it does not take into account allocation concealment, viewed by The Cochrane Collaboration as paramount to avoid bias.

Loire Aviation

Loire Aviation was a French aircraft manufacturer in the inter-war period, specializing in seaplanes, and based in Saint-Nazaire, France.
History.
Loire was founded in 1925 as a division of Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire, a shipbuilding company based at St Nazaire. ACL were interested in diversifying into the new area of naval aviation, combining its knowledge of metal work and naval construction to produce seaplanes for the French mail service. The company started as a joint venture between ACL and Gourdou-Leseurre, contracting to build 257 GL 32’s under licence at a new factory at St Nazaire.
In 1928 they disassociated, in 1930 the company became Loire Aviation, working on own designs by designers Asselot, Jarrion, and Guegand Kerguistel. 
During this period Loire built some 232 units of their Loire 11 seaplane, as well as aircraft for other companies, and produced a range of aircraft under the Loire marque. 
In 1933 the company united with Nieuport, (by then known as Nieuport-Astra) though both companies maintained their own factories and test sites; Loire at St Nazaire and La Baule, Nieuport at Issy-les-Moulineaux and Villacoublay. This led to some complications; the two companies found themselves competing over a contract for a fighter for the French Air Force, later won by Morane Saulnier with the MS 406.
The two companies underwent a full merger in 1935 to form the "Société Anonyme Loire-Nieuport"(SALN), or Loire-Nieuport.
In 1936 Loire-Nieuport was nationalized and united with Breguet of Bouguenais, near Nantes, to form the "Société Nationale des Constructions Aéronautiques de l'Ouest" (SNCAO).

François Prélat

François Prélat was a French gunsmith and inventor. He is thought to have invented the first fully contained cartridge in 1808, as well as the percussion cap in 1818.
In association with the Swiss gunsmith Jean Samuel Pauly, François Prélat invented from 1808 to 1812 the first totally contained cartridge, incorporating in one package a fulminate primer, black powder and a round bullet. A percussion pin would provoke ignition. This was a marked improvement over the invention of Jean Lepage, in which the fulminate was simply poured into a pan near the breech. The new cartridge was particularly considered useful for cavalry firearms, as the motion of the horse and the difficulty of movement rendered conventional loading extremely difficult. This center-fire design is today the most commonly used. The two men had set up a gunsmith shop together 4, rue des Trois-Frères, in Paris.
In 1818, Prélat took a patent, or "Certificat d'addition", for the invention of the percussion cap (ignition copper cap) to be used in cartridges, thus replacing the magazine lock mechanism.
Prélat showed some firearms of his conception at the 1855 Paris Universal Exposition.

Isaac Wake

Sir Isaac Wake (1580/81-1632) was an English diplomat and political commentator. He served as ambassador to Savoy for sixteen years, and later as ambassador to France.
Early life.
Isaac Wake was the second son of Arthur, son of John Wake of Hartwell, Northamptonshire, a descendant of the lords of Blisworth. His father, a canon of Christ Church and master of St. John's Hospital in Northampton, was rector of Great Billing in Northamptonshire until 1573, when he was deprived for nonconformity; he afterwards lived for many years in Jersey. Born in 1580 or 1581, Isaac Wake entered Christ Church, Oxford in 1593, and graduated B.A. in 1597; he was elected fellow of Merton College, Oxford in 1598, and graduated M.A. in 1603. In 1604 he became a student at the Middle Temple, and on 14 December 1604 was elected public orator of Oxford University. He took part in the reception of King James in 1605, delivering an oration "at the Hall-stair's foot in Christ Church." The king seems to have thought his oratory polished, if soporific. In 1607, he delivered a funeral oration on John Rainolds.
Diplomatic career.
In 1609, Wake travelled in France and Italy, and soon afterwards became secretary to Sir Dudley Carleton at Venice. In March 1612, his leave of absence from Merton College was extended for three years; but in the following November he came to England for a few months, during which he pronounced a funeral oration on Sir Thomas Bodley. He returned to Venice in March 1613, and stayed there, and afterwards at Turin, as Carleton's secretary until the latter left for England in July 1615. Wake then became British representative at the court of Savoy, and retained that office for nearly sixteen years. In 1617 he went to Bern, at the request of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, to mediate an alliance between Savoy and the Swiss states. At the end of 1618 he came to London, being "much courted" by the French ministers on his way through Paris, and was knighted on 9 April 1619 at Royston, Hertfordshire, where the king lay ill in bed. Immediately afterwards he was sent back to Turin with an offer of support to the duke in his candidature for the imperial crown, and at the same time with an informal mission to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, whom he saw at Heidelberg on his way out. On the death of Sir Henry Savile, in February 1622, Prince Charles tried to secure Wake's election as warden of Merton; but he was beaten by (Sir) Nathaniel Brent, the influence of the Abbots, combined perhaps with Wake's constant absence from England, proving too strong. 
Wake was in England again in December 1623, when he married Anna, daughter of Edmund Bray of Barrington, and stepdaughter to Sir Edward Conway, the secretary of state. He was returned M.P. for Oxford University in January 1624, and attended parliament closely until his departure in May as ambassador to Savoy and Venice, with special instructions to endeavour to gain the assistance of those states for the recovery of the palatinate. Towards the end of 1626 he was employed on a mission to Bern and Zurich on behalf of the Grisons; and in 1627 he endeavoured to mediate, at the king of Denmark's request, between that monarch and the Duke of Savoy. After narrowly escaping the plague which ravaged Piedmont in 1630, he was appointed ambassador to the French court, and had audience of Louis XIII in May 1631.
Isaac Wake was spoken of as likely to succeed Viscount Dorchester as secretary of state when the latter died in February 1632; but before the appointment was made he died himself, from an attack of fever, at Paris in June 1632. His body was brought to England with the ceremony due to his rank, and buried in the chapel of Dover Castle. His widow petitioned the king for a pension, and for the payment of about £1,400 due to her husband at the time of his death, representing herself as destitute. The arrears at any rate seem to have been paid ultimately, for in 1633 Lady Wake bought an annuity from her half-brother, Lord Conway, for £1,450.
Works.
Wake's published works are:
An epitaph on James I, in English verse, was attributed to him. 
Wake's despatches are among the foreign state papers at the Public Record Office. His letter-books from 1615 to 1630 are in the British Library, and so are a few of his letters to Buckingham, Carlisle, and others. Some of his despatches are printed in "Cabala", and others in Gardiner's "Letters and Documents".

<doc id="20140518" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20140518" title="Bait and bleed">
Bait and bleed

Bait and bleed is a military strategy described by international relations theorist John J. Mearsheimer in his book on offensive realism, "The Tragedy of Great Power Politics". The aim is to induce rival states to engage in a protracted war of attrition against each other "so that they bleed each other white", while the baiter who encouraged the conflict remains on the sidelines, maintaining its military strength.
Mearsheimer cites as an example Russia's efforts to provoke Austria and Prussia into war with France shortly after the French Revolution, evidenced by Catherine the Great's statement to her secretary in 1791, "I am racking my brains in order to push the courts of Vienna and Berlin into French affairs...There are reasons I cannot talk about; I want to get them involved in that business to have my hands free. I have much unfinished business, and it's necessary for them to be kept busy and out of my way."
Mearsheimer describes a similar strategy which he calls "Bloodletting" which does not involve incitement or baiting by a third party. When a state's rivals have gone to war independently, the aim is to encourage the conflict to continue as long as possible, in order to let the rival states weaken or "bleed" each other's military strength, while the bloodletting party stays out of the fighting.
This strategy is exemplified in then-U. S. Senator Harry Truman's statement in 1941 regarding the Nazi invasion of Russia, "If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible."
Another example of this strategy was Russia's withdrawal from World War I while the fighting in Europe between Germany and the remaining Allies continued. In his report to the Third Congress of Soviets in 1918, Vladimir Lenin argued that by withdrawing from the conflict "we rid ourselves...of both imperialistic groups fighting each other. We can take advantage of their strife...and use that period when our hands are free to develop and strengthen the Socialist Revolution."

Antoine Favre, baron of Pérouges, (5 October 1557 – 1624) was a Savoisian nobleman and jurist.
Favre was born in Bourg-en-Bresse. After studies in Paris and Turin, he practiced law in Chambéry. He was a member of the Savoyard court there from 1585 onwards, and its president from 1610 onwards.
His principal scholarly work is the "Codex Fabrianus definitionum forensium" (1609), a report of the decisions of his court organised after the Justinian Code. Favre's other research, conjectures about the Justinian code in which he endeavours to separate the Justinian insertions from the classical Roman texts, is still valued by scholars today.
