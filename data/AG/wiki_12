Aomori Bay Bridge

The is a cable-stayed bridge in Aomori. It was constructed in order to alleviate cargo ship traffic. It is a famous part of Aomori City's scenery.
Details.
The Aomori Bay Bridge is the longest in Aomori City at 1219 meters. It's the second longest bridge in Aomori Prefecture after the 1323.7 meter Hachinoe Oohashi Bridge. Previously the longest bridge in Aomori City was the 993.9 meter Aomori-nishi Bypass overpass, now the third longest bridge in Aomori Prefecture.
Emphasis was placed on the aesthetics of the bridge causing the total cost of construction to come to approximately 27 billion yen in comparison to only 8.9 billion yen for the longer Hachinoe Oohashi Bridge. An example of the emphasis on the bridge's appearance is the emblazoning of the letter "A", for "Aomori", at various places such as the base of the bridge and in the shape of the suspension cables. The use of the letter "A" continues on from the nearby Aomori Prefecture Tourism Center “Asupamu”, which is built in the shape of a triangle so that it would look like the initial "A".
The bridge's main tower is made from high strength concrete.
In response to the bridge's long standing problems with ice in the winter months, a plan was made to lay pipes circulating sea water under the road surface to melt the ice. However, due to problems related to the cost and construction time, only one section was able to be completed. As yet there are no indications of when the system will be implemented over the remainder of the bridge as originally planned. Even so, since the installation of the system the number of traffic accidents has drastically decreased.

Patellar dislocation

Patella dislocation is an injury of the knee, typically caused by a direct blow or a sudden twist of the leg. It occurs when the patella (kneecap) slips out of its normal position in the patellofemoral groove, and generally causes intense pain with effusion. Open or arthroscopic surgery may be used to repair damage, but are typically avoided since rates of re-injury, knee function, and patients' opinions do not differ much from conservative treatment.
The patella generally dislocates laterally, and can be accompanied by acute pain and disability. Immediate reduction can be accomplished by hyperextension of the knee, and by providing a medialward pressure to move the patella back into the patellofemoral groove. Hyperextension of the knee on its own could possibly move the patella into place, because this motion locks the knee in place. When the knee is locked the ligaments are twisted and taut, allowing the muscles involved to relax and the patella to slide back into place. If that does not work, a medical professional must manually perform an orthopedic reduction. Swelling and impaired mobility follow patellar dislocation, and a rehabilitation program of six to sixteen weeks is recommended whether or not the patient undergoes surgery.
Young athletes suffer patellar dislocations more commonly than any other group, and the average age of occurrences is 16–20 years. Sports commonly associated with the injury involve sudden twisting motions of the knee and/or impact, such as soccer, gymnastics and ice hockey. It can also occur when a person trips over an object or slips on a slick surface, especially if that person has predisposing factors.
Anatomy of the knee.
The patella is a triangular sesamoid bone which is embedded in tendon. It rests in the patellofemoral groove, an articular cartilage-lined hollow at the end of the thigh bone (femur) where the thigh bone meets the shin bone (tibia). Several ligaments and tendons hold the patella in place and allow it to move up and down the patellofemoral groove when the leg bends. The top of the patella attaches to the quadriceps muscle via the quadriceps tendon, the middle to the vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis muscles, and the bottom to the head of the tibia (tibial tuberosity) via the patellar tendon, which is a continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon. The medial patellofemoral ligament attaches horizontally in the inner knee to the adductor magnus tendon and is the structure most often damaged during a patellar dislocation. Finally, the lateral collateral ligament and the medial collateral ligament stabilize the patella on either side. Any of these structures can sustain damage during a patellar dislocation.
Mechanism of injury.
Patellar dislocations occur by:
Predisposing factors.
A predisposing factor is tightness in the tensor fasciae latae muscle and iliotibial tract in combination with a quadriceps imbalance between the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscles can play a large role. However individuals with larger Q angles are genetically more predisposed to this type of injury due to the increased lateral angle at which the femur and tibia meet.
Epidemiology.
In a journal by the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Brian Waterman collected incidence rate data in respect to sex, age and race in the United States. Patellar dislocations have been estimated to occur among an at-risk population of 1,774,210,081 people each year. Incidence rates published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine for ages 10–17 were found to be about 29 per 100,000 persons per year, while the adult population average for this type of injury ranged between 5.8 and 7.0 per 100,000 persons per year. The highest rates of patellar dislocation were found in the youngest age groups, while the rates declined with increasing ages. Females are more susceptible to patellar dislocation. Race is a significant factor for this injury, where Hispanics, African-Americans and Caucasians had slightly higher rates of patellar dislocation due to the types of athletic activity involved in: basketball (18.2%), soccer (6.9%), and football (6.9%), according to Brian Waterman.
Symptoms and signs.
Patients often describe pain as being “inside the knee cap.” The leg tends to flex even when relaxed.
To assess the knee, a clinician can perform the Patellar Apprehension Test by moving the patella back and forth while the patient flexes the knee at approximately 30 degrees.
The patient can do the "patella tracking assessment" by making a single leg squat and standing, or by lying on his or her back with knee extended from flexed position. A patella that slips medially on early flexion is called the , and indicates imbalance between the VMO and lateral structures.
Risks.
Another cause of patellar symptoms is "lateral patellar compression syndrome", which can be caused from lack of balance or inflammation in the joints. The pathophysiology of the kneecap is complex, and deals with the osseous soft tissue or abnormalities within the patellofemoral groove. The patellar symptoms cause knee extensor dysplasia, and sensitive small variations affect the muscular mechanism that controls the joint movements.
Forces.
When there is too much tension on the patella, the ligaments will weaken and be susceptible to tearing ligaments or tendons due to shear force or torsion force, which then displaces the kneecap from its origination. Another cause that patellar dislocation can occur is when the trochlear groove that has been completely flattened is defined as trochlear dysplasia. Not having a groove because the trochlear bone has flattened out can cause the patella to slide because nothing is holding the patella in place.
Treatment options.
Two types of treatment options are typically available:
Surgery may impede normal growth of structures in the knee, so doctors generally do not recommend knee operations for young people who are still growing. There are also risks of complications, such as an adverse reaction to anesthesia or an infection.
When designing a rehabilitation program, clinicians consider associated injuries such as chipped bones or soft tissue tears. Clinicians take into account the patient's age, activity level, and time needed to return to work and/or athletics. Doctors generally only recommend surgery when other structures in the knee have sustained severe damage, or specifically when there is:
Supplements like glucosamine and NSAIDs can be used to keep the knee strong.
Post-treatment rehabilitation.
An effective rehabilitation program reduces the chances of reinjury and of other knee-related problems such as patellofemoral pain syndrome and osteoarthritis. Rehabilitation focuses on maintaining strength and range of motion to reduce pain and maintain the health of the muscles and tissues around the knee joint.
Prevention.
The patella is a floating sesamoid bone held in place by the quadriceps muscle tendon and patellar tendon ligament. Exercises should strengthen quadriceps muscles such as rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis. However, tight and strong lateral quadriceps can be an underlying cause of patellar dislocation. If this is the case, it is advisable to strengthen the medial quadriceps, vastus medialis (VMO), and stretch the lateral muscles. Exercises to strengthen quadriceps muscles include, but are not limited to, squats and lunges. Adding extra external support around the knee by using devices such as knee or athletic tape can help to prevent patellar dislocation and other knee-related injuries. External supports, such as knee braces and athletic tape, work by providing movement in only the desired planes and help hinder movements that can cause abnormal movement and injuries. Women who wear high heels tend to develop short calf muscles and tendons. Exercises to stretch and strengthen calf muscles are recommended on a daily basis.

<doc id="20177296" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20177296" title="Characterization">
Characterization

Characterization or characterisation is the concept of creating characters for a narrative. It is a literary element and may be employed in dramatic works of art or everyday conversation. Characters may be presented by means of description, through their actions, speech, or thoughts.
History.
The term "characterization" was introduced in mid 15th century. Aristotle promoted the primacy of plot over characters, that is a plot-driven narrative, arguing in his "Poetics" that tragedy "is a representation, not of men, but of action and life." This view was reversed in the 19th century, when the primacy of the character, that is a character-driven narrative, was affirmed first with the petty bourgeois realist novel, and increasingly later with the influential development of psychology.
Direct vs. indirect.
There are two ways an author can convey information about a character:
In drama.
However the playwright and actor also have the choice of indirect characterization in a similar vein to the writer in literature. The presentation of a character for a sociological discussion only has to be as real as the discussion requires. In this way a character can be used as an iconic reference by a playwright to suggest location, an epoch in history, or even draw in a political debate. The inclusion of a stock character, or in literary terms an archetypal character, by a playwright can risk drawing overly simplistic pictures of people and smack of stereotyping. However, the degree of success in direct characterization in order to swiftly get to the action varies from play to play, and often according to the use the character is put to. In explicitly characterising a certain character the actor makes a similar gamble. The choice of what aspects of a character are "demonstrated" by the actor to directly characterise is a political choice and makes a statement as to the ethics and agenda of the actor.
Character features.
Weaknesses.
Weaknesses in a character, like vices, imperfections or flaws, make him or her appear more human-like causing the audience to identify him/her self with that specific character.This is a good characterization for a character in most fiction and non-fiction stories.Weakness also causes a character to be more imperfect like a real human and allows them to make mistakes.

Gilbert Ondongo (born 1960) is a Congolese politician who has served as Minister of Finance in the government of Congo-Brazzaville since 2009. Previously he was Minister of Labour from 2005 to 2009.
Political career.
Born at Owando, Ondongo belongs to the Kouyou ethnic group. He began working at the Marien Ngouabi University in Brazzaville in the 1980s. After Denis Sassou Nguesso returned to power in the June–October 1997 civil war, he appointed Ondongo as Adviser to the President on the Economy, Finance, and the Budget; Ondongo served in that post from 1997 to 2002. He was then appointed to the government on 18 August 2002 as Secretary of State for Budgetary Reform and Financial Administration, working under the Minister of the Economy, Finance, and the Budget. He was promoted to the position of Minister of Labour, Employment, and Social Security on 7 January 2005.
Ondongo was Congo's candidate for the Presidency of the 96th Session of the International Labour Conference, but Congo withdrew his candidacy on 1 June 2007, allowing the unopposed election of Albania's Kastriot Sulka.
During the campaign for the July 2009 presidential election, Ondongo worked on President Sassou Nguesso's re-election campaign, heading the campaign's finance and budgetary control department. After Sassou Nguesso won re-election, he moved Ondongo to the post of Minister of Finance on 15 September 2009.
On 28 January 2010, Ondongo announced that Congo-Brazzaville had reached its "completion point" in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries program, a debt relief initiative, thereby qualifying for a large reduction in the size of its external debt.
At the PCT's Sixth Extraordinary Congress, held in July 2011, Ondongo was elected to the PCT's 51-member Political Bureau. In the July–August 2012 parliamentary election, Ondongo stood as the PCT candidate in the first constituency of Owando. He won the seat in the first round with 75.19% of the vote. In the government appointed after the election, on 25 September 2012, Ondongo retained the finance portfolio and was additionally assigned responsibility for planning; he was also promoted to the rank of Minister of State.
In October 2013, Ondongo presented the draft of the national budget for 2014 to the National Assembly; the budget was increased slightly, from 4.12 billion CFA francs in 2013 to 4.13 billion for 2014.

Protein phosphatase 2

Protein phosphatase 2 (PP2), also known as PP2A, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the "PPP2CA" gene. The PP2A heterotrimeric protein phosphatase, is a ubiquitous and conserved serine/threonine phosphatase with broad substrate specificity and diverse cellular functions. Among the targets of PP2A are proteins of oncogenic signaling cascades, such as Raf, MEK, and AKT.
Structure and function.
PP2A consists of a dimeric core enzyme composed of the structural A and catalytic C subunits, and a regulatory B subunit. When the PP2A catalytic C subunit associates with the A and B subunits several species of holoenzymes are produced with distinct functions and characteristics. The A subunit, a founding member of the HEAT repeat protein family (huntington-elongation-A subunit-TOR), is the scaffold required for the formation of the heterotrimeric complex. When the A subunit binds it alters the enzymatic activity of the catalytic subunit, even if the B subunit is absent. While C and A subunit sequences show remarkable sequence conservation throughout eukaryotes, regulatory B subunits are more heterogeneous and are believed to play key roles in controlling the localization and specific activity of different holoenzymes. Multicellular eukaryotes express four classes of variable regulatory subunits: B (PR55), B′ (B56 or PR61), B″ (PR72), and B‴ (PR93/PR110), with at least 16 members in these subfamilies. In addition, accessory proteins and posttranslational modifications (such as methylation) control PP2A subunit associations and activities.
The two catalytic metal ions located at bottom of PP2A's active site have been recently identified as manganese.

Functional contextualism

Functional contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general and the field of behavior analysis in particular. Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy. It can be viewed as an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism, and emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.
Contextualism.
The form of contextualism from which functional contextualism emerged is the one described by the philosopher Stephen C. Pepper in his book "World Hypotheses: A Study in Evidence". In this work, Pepper noted that philosophical systems tend to cluster around a few distinct "world hypotheses" or "world views." Each world view is characterized by a distinctive underlying root metaphor and truth criterion. Root metaphors are based on seemingly well-understood, common-sense, everyday objects or ideas, and serve as the basic analogy by which an analyst attempts to understand the world. A world view's root metaphor roughly corresponds to its ontological assumptions, or views about the nature of being or existence (e.g., whether the universe is deterministic or not). Truth criteria are inextricably linked to their root metaphors, and provide the basis for evaluating the validity of analyses. A world view's truth criterion roughly corresponds to its epistemological assumptions, or views about the nature of knowledge and truth (e.g., whether it is discovered or constructed).
The root metaphor of contextualism is the "act in context," whereby any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context. The truth criterion of contextualism is often dubbed "successful working," whereby the truth and meaning of an idea lies in its function or utility, not in how well it is said to mirror reality. In contextualism, an analysis is said to be true or valid insofar it as it leads to effective action, or achievement of some goal. Contextualism is Pepper's term for the philosophical pragmatism developed by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and others.
Varieties of contextualism.
Analytic goals are vitally important to the contextualistic world view. This is because the analytic tools of contextualism—its root metaphor and truth criterion—both hinge on the purpose of the analysis, and neither can be mounted effectively without a clearly specified analytic goal. The pragmatic truth criterion of "successful working" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because "success" can only be measured in relation to the achievement of some objective.
Likewise, the root metaphor of the "act-in-context" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because there would be no basis on which to restrict the analysis to a subset of the infinite expanse of the act's historical and environmental context. Without a clear analytic goal, the contextualist could analyze the endless context of an act in perpetuity, without ever knowing when the analysis was complete or good enough to be deemed "true" or "useful." It is very difficult for a contextualist without an explicit goal to construct or share knowledge.
Contextualists can, and do, adopt different analytic goals, and the many different varieties of contextualism can be distinguished by their goals. Based on their overarching analytic goals, contextualistic theories can be divided into two general categories: "descriptive contextualism" and "functional contextualism."
Descriptive contextualism.
Descriptive contextualists seek to understand the complexity and richness of a whole event through a personal and aesthetic appreciation of its participants and features. This approach reveals a strong adherence to the root metaphor of contextualism and can be likened to the enterprise of history, in which stories of the past are constructed in an attempt to understand whole events. The knowledge constructed by the descriptive contextualist is personal, ephemeral, specific, and spatiotemporally restricted. Like a historical narrative, it is knowledge that reflects an in-depth personal understanding of a particular event that occurred (or is occurring) at a particular time and place. Most forms of contextualism, including social constructionism, dramaturgy, hermeneutics, and narrative approaches, are instances of descriptive contextualism.
Functional contextualism.
Functional contextualists, on the other hand, seek to predict and influence events using empirically based concepts and rules. This approach reveals a strong adherence to contextualism's extremely practical truth criterion and can be likened to the enterprise of science or engineering, in which general rules and principles are used to predict and influence events. Rules or theories that do not contribute to the achievement of one's practical goals are ignored or rejected. Knowledge constructed by the functional contextualist is general, abstract, and spatiotemporally unrestricted. Like a scientific principle, it is knowledge that is likely to be applicable to all (or many) similar such events, regardless of time or place.

Winter Challenge

Winter Challenge is a video game that portrays seven winter sports that are competed in during the Winter Olympics. This game however was not endorsed by the International Olympic Committee, the United States Olympic Committee, or any
similar organization for any other country. It was released for the Mega Drive/Genesis and DOS.
Menu Options.
The game offered a Training mode where you can participate in a single event as one player. Once completed you could go again, return to the main menu, or watch an instant replay of your performance in the event. The other mode was Tournament mode where you could create and participate with up to 10 players. If less than ten players were created, the computer would provide the rest. Once the players were selected, the game shows an Opening Ceremonies clip and then took you to a tournament screen where you could see your icons for the seven events, as well as four button that would show your current standings, start a new tournament, enter a password to return to an existing tournament, or return the main menu.
Gameplay.
Most of the games consisted of using the directional pad for steering, and the A, B, and C buttons for performing certain functions like shooting, running, braking, or pushing off, as you would for the ski jump. Button mashing was necessary at times for a couple of the events, but most were focused on timing and accuracy. The ski jump was scored by distance, and the biathlon was scored by time and shooting accuracy. All the other events were scored by time.
Reception.
"Computer Gaming World" liked the game's graphics and the quick play, and recommended it to those interested in downhill skiing.

Melissa Lee

Melissa Ji-Yun Lee (, "Lee Ji-yeon") (born circa 1966) is a New Zealand politician. She was elected to the House of Representatives as a list MP for the National Party in the 2008 election. She is currently Parliamentary Private Secretary for Ethnic Affairs under Judith Collins.
Early life and career.
Lee was born in South Korea and grew up in Malaysia before moving to Australia and then to New Zealand in 1988 with her family. She has a MA Hons (First Class) in Communication Studies. She spent twenty three years in journalism including a five-year stint at the "Sunday News" and writing for numerous publications including the "New Zealand Herald" and "The Listener".
She was also the producer of the TV magazine series, "Asia Downunder".
Member of Parliament.
In November 2008, Lee became a List MP in the New Zealand Parliament. Her maiden speech included sections in English, Māori, and Korean. In English, she mentioned crime, education, and anti-Asian racism issues in New Zealand. In the Māori section, she mentioned the history of Māori first coming to New Zealand by canoe from Hawaiki and compared it to her own migration to New Zealand by aeroplane. Near the end of her speech, she thanked, in Korean, all the people that had given her support "simply by virtue of shared heritage".
Lee became the second Korean, and first Korean woman, to win election to a non-Korean national legislature. (The first Korean elected to a foreign national-level office, Jay Kim, became a member of the United States House of Representatives in 1992.)
A poll conducted between 10 December 2008 and 19 April 2009 by the Spanish newspaper, "20 minutos" (20 minutes) ranked Lee as the world's 51st most beautiful female politician.
Allegations were made in May 2009 that Lee's production company Asia Vision had spent New Zealand on Air money making a promotional video for the National Party ahead of the 2008 election. Lee called the allegations "ridiculous", saying that all work on the video was done by volunteers. The Green Party referred the video to the Electoral Commission, saying that it should have been declared as an election expense.
An investigation conducted by New Zealand on Air later cleared Lee of the charge of misuse of funding.
Lee used NZ$100,000 of contingency funding to increase the markup for "Asia Downunder" in violation of her contract with New Zealand on Air, which she described as "an innocent error".
In April 2011 Lee courted controversy when, after she had made a speech supporting the controversially rushed-through copyright law 92A, it emerged that hours earlier she had tweeted "Ok. Shower... Reading ... And then bed! listening to a compilation a friend did for me of K Pop. Fab. Thanks Jay." which appeared to contradict her stance on law 92A.
Mount Albert by-election.
On 16 April 2009, Lee announced her candidacy for the National Party nomination in the Mount Albert by-election 2009.
She defeated the previous local National candidate, Ravi Musuku, to win selection for the National Party on 4 May 2009.
On 13 May 2009 Lee told a candidates' meeting that the SH20 Waterview Connection could divert criminals from South Auckland away from the electorate. Lee apologised the next day, saying "if South Auckland people (find) my comments offensive, I apologise. It wasn't about them. It was about criminals." Prime Minister John Key later said the remark was a "stupid statement to make". Later that day she apologised again saying, "I apologise unreservedly for the comments I made regarding South Auckland... I sincerely regret my remarks."
In the by-election, Lee attracted only 3,542 votes, coming a distant second to Labour's David Shearer's 13,260 votes. In the 2011 election she increased her electoral vote and the National Party party vote came within 150 votes of Labour's, but Lee failed for a second time to take the seat.
On 20 December 2011 John Key announced that Lee and John Hayes would become Parliamentary Private Secretaries, a role not in use for several years. Key appointed her to the portfolio of Ethnic Affairs, given the heavy workload of Judith Collins as the newly appointed Minister of Justice.

Ekkehard II

Ekkehard II (died 23 April 990), called "Palatinus" (the Courtier), was a monk of the Abbey of Saint Gall. He and Ekkehard III were nephews of the preceding, who educated also at St. Gall his other nephews, Notker the physician and Burkard, later abbot of the monastery. Ekkehard II was taught by his uncle and the monk Geraldus, and was later a teacher in the monastery school. A number of his pupils joined the order; others became bishops.
According to the "" he was called later to Hohentwiel, the seat of the Duchess Hadwig of Swabia, widow of Burkard II. The duchess was wont occasionally to visit St. Gall, and eventually (973) asked for and obtained the services of Ekkehard as her tutor in the reading of the Latin classics. Nevertheless, he continued to render great services to his monastery, especially on the occasion of the differences between St. Gall and Reichenau (Abbot Ruodmann); in many other ways also he proved himself useful to the monks by the influence he had obtained as tutor of the duchess.
Ekkehard was also prominent at the imperial court of Otto I. Later he became provost of Mainz Cathedral where he died 23 April 990. He was buried in the church of St. Alban, outside the city gates. He was the author of various ecclesiastical hymns, known as sequences, all of which are lost, except one in honour of St. Desiderius.
Johann Joseph Abert's 1878 opera "Ekkehard" is based on his life.

<doc id="20177464" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20177464" title="Maryland–Virginia football rivalry">
Maryland–Virginia football rivalry

The Maryland–Virginia football rivalry is an American college football rivalry between the Maryland Terrapins football team of the University of Maryland and Virginia Cavaliers football team of the University of Virginia. The Terrapins and Cavaliers first met on the football field in 1919 and the series has been played annually without interruption since 1957, although the series' future is in doubt beyond 2013 because of Maryland leaving the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for the Big Ten Conference in 2014.
Maryland leads the series 44–32–2, although Virginia is 15–7 in the rivalry since 1991. Maryland possesses the longest winning streak of the series, sixteen games between 1972 and 1987, while Virginia has the second longest streak with nine consecutive wins ending in 2000. 
Background.
Contributing factors.
Several factors contribute to the intensity of the rivalry. The two states, and their eponymous flagship universities based in Charlottesville, Virginia and College Park, Maryland, respectively, share close historical and cultural ties. The schools are located in relatively close geographic proximity, separated by about . Due in large part to this proximity, the schools aggressively compete for recruits in the Mid-Atlantic region. Former Maryland coach Ralph Friedgen expressed the importance of the rivalry by stating, "It's a potential rivalry in every sport we play. They're border states. We compete for students, not just athletes."
The two are both long-time members of the Atlantic Coast Conference, with Maryland becoming a founding member in 1953 and Virginia joining later in that same year. When the conference reorganized in 2005, Maryland and Virginia were placed in separate divisions, but designated as cross-divisional rivals that continue to meet annually. The intensity of the rivalry is increased by a long history in the series of comebacks, shutouts, and spoilers that prevented one team from securing a conference championship or bowl game appearance. From the 1920s until 1945, the teams competed for the Tydings Trophy, named for former politician and Maryland alum Millard Tydings who had several friends amongst the professors at Virginia. In 2003, the schools discussed reviving the trophy tradition, but it was ultimately rejected by Virginia, due to concerns over the reorganization of the ACC.
Before and after their meeting in 2010, players from both schools attributed the importance of the game to the negative feelings the programs have for each other. Virginia center Anthony Mihota said "I guess it's because we don't like them very much. Something about them that gets under our skin". After Maryland's victory, Terp linebacker Adrian Moten commented, "This was a big win in the rivalry. They hate us. We hate them."
The high academic standing of the University of Virginia in a national publication has added to the competitiveness between the two. In 2003, University of Maryland president C.D. Mote asserted that, in academic terms, Virginia was "highly overrated these days ... "U.S. News & World Report" places them at the top of the pile with Berkeley, which is ridiculous." Mote further stated that students from the state of Maryland paying a higher tuition cost to attend the University of Virginia "don’t know any better." While the University of Virginia president, John Casteen, said such remarks can be taken out of context, Virginia board of visitors member, William H. Goodwin, responded in "The Cavalier Daily", "I certainly think a college president should have more class, but you have to expect that from Maryland."
Relative importance.
Former Virginia head coach Al Groh stopped short of calling the game with Maryland a 'rivalry', but said that "it is a very important game to our team and it is our annual game. So that certainly designates it as being different from the other games." Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen conceded that "has Virginia Tech as an in-state rivalry, but I think we're their out-of-state rivalry."
Maryland–Virginia is the second most played out-of-state rivalry for Virginia, after the longest standing rivalry in the ACC, the South's Oldest Rivalry between Virginia and North Carolina. It is the fourth most played for the Cavaliers overall, after North Carolina, Virginia Tech (Commonwealth Cup), and Virginia Military Institute. In contrast, Maryland–Virginia is the most-played historical series for Maryland.
Noteworthy games.
1945.
Maryland 19, Virginia 13
In 1945, the two teams met for a neutral site match-up at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. Head coach Frank Murray, a future Hall of Fame inductee, had led 13th-ranked Virginia to a perfect 7–0 record. The Cavaliers also held an undefeated streak of fourteen games. Bear Bryant was in his only year as Maryland's head coach. Maryland's Sam Behr broke away for a 90-yard touchdown run, but Virginia held the lead in the fourth quarter. In the final seconds of play, Terrapin freshman tailback Bill "Red" Poling completed a forward pass to end Don Gleasner for a 50-yard score. With the win, Maryland tied the all-time series record. The 19–13 loss to Maryland ended Virginia's perfect season and they fell to 20th place in the AP Poll. After this game, the series went on hiatus for 11 years, and it was the last year the Tydings Trophy was awarded.
1961.
Virginia 28, Maryland 16
Tom Nugent's Terps entered their last season game boasting a 7–2 record that included a win over seventh-ranked Syracuse with Heisman Trophy-winner Ernie Davis and the only victory over Penn State in school history to date. They faced a Virginia team that started off their season by breaking a three-year, 28-game losing streak against William & Mary. The Cavaliers had lost the last three meetings against Maryland by an average of 38 points. With a win against Virginia, the Terps would secure the ACC title and a trip to the Gator Bowl. After Maryland scored for an early lead, Virginia quarterback Gary Cuozzo tossed three short touchdown passes to third-string receiver John Hepler. Defensive back Ted Rzempoluch returned an interception 95 yards for a touchdown, and sealed the Terps' fate to go bowl-less. The other three-loss team in the ACC, Duke, won the conference.
1988.
Virginia 24, Maryland 23
In the final minutes of the game, with the Terps trailing the Cavaliers 24–17, Maryland quarterback Neil O'Donnell was injured and taken out of the game. He was replaced by a young second-stringer Scott Zolak. Zolak led a drive which culminated with a three-yard option run for a touchdown narrowing the deficit to a point. With 1:09 left in the game, Maryland went for two. Zolak threw into the endzone to running back Ricky Johnson. Johnson appeared to catch the ball before being hit by defensive back Keith McMeans, knocking the ball loose. An official in the endzone immediately signaled for a catch, before others waved it as incomplete. After the game, the usually level-headed Terps head coach Joe Krivak ran to the official who made the initial call, following him to the locker room, and then ran over to yell at referee Don Safrit. Several witnesses claim he said to the officials that "If it takes every ounce of energy, I'm going to get you out of this league." Virginia (7–4) broke their 16-game losing streak in the series and finished second in the conference. Maryland (5–6) failed to achieve a winning season for the third consecutive year. However, the Cavaliers failed to secure a bowl game berth, while N.C. State with a worse record went on to the Peach Bowl.
1990.
Maryland 35, Virginia 30
Besieged Maryland head coach Joe Krivak, with a 17–25 record, led his Terps (5–5) to a sold-out Scott Stadium in Charlottesville for their final regular season game. George Welsh's eighth-ranked Virginia (8–1) had spent three weeks atop the AP poll at number-one until a loss against Georgia Tech. At halftime, Maryland trailed 21–7. Then freshman reserve running back Mark Mason put the Terps back in the game with a 59-yard touchdown breakaway, and a team best run for the year. Maryland quarterback Scott Zolak threw for two more touchdowns and Mason scored the go-ahead with an 8-yard rush to put the Terps ahead 35–30. With the win, Maryland secured a bowl berth for the first time since Bobby Ross left four seasons prior. Virginia took a nose-dive in the AP rankings to 17th, and after another loss to Virginia Tech settled for the Sugar Bowl where they were edged by Tennessee, 23–22.
1999.
Virginia 34, Maryland 30
After starting 5–2, Maryland suffered a three-game losing streak before their finale at Byrd Stadium. Maryland needed to beat Virginia to finish with a winning season and likely secure a berth in the Aloha Bowl or Oahu Bowl. At the end of the first quarter, Virginia led 17–0. Maryland's freshman quarterback Latrez Harrison was pulled and replaced by former safety Randall Jones. Jones along with Heisman prospect running back LaMont Jordan led the Terps to tie it at 17 before halftime. In the third quarter, Jordan ran 90 yards to make it 24–17, but the Cavaliers tied it soon after. With 5:18 left, Terps kicker Brian Kopka made a field goal to make it 30–27. In the next series, Virginia went for it on fourth down but a Dan Ellis pass was incomplete. The Terps took over on downs with 1:40 left. Victory seemed assured, but Maryland failed to convert a first down and the inexperienced Randall Jones ran out of bounds on third down, which stopped the clock when Virginia had no time-outs. The Cavaliers got the ball on their own 24-yard line. In nine plays and just 46 seconds, Dan Ellis led a 76-yard drive that culminated with a touchdown pass to Billy McMullen to win the game with 26 seconds left. The 34–30 loss dashed the Terrapins' hopes for their first bowl game since 1990. After the game, Maryland coach Ron Vanderlinden remarked "Devastating. The worst loss I've ever been associated with because of what was on the line."
2002.
Virginia 48, Maryland 13
After Terps head coach Ralph Friedgen stated Maryland expected to "beat teams like Duke and Virginia", the Cavs sought vindication for the comparison to ACC football's perpetual underdog. While Maryland's Scott McBrien passed for a touchdown in the first series, Virginia went on to score 20 unanswered points in the second quarter with two Matt Schaub passes and two field goals. In the second half, the Cavaliers delivered four more touchdowns: another Schaub pass, a pass by receiver Billy McMullen, and two short rushing scores. The Terps only managed to use Nick Novak to make two field goals. The loss broke Maryland's eight-game winning streak, and prevented them from sharing a piece of the ACC championship. Instead, Florida State finished with a better conference record (7–1), and secured the title outright.
2003.
Maryland 27, Virginia 17
With leading rusher Bruce Perry out due to a sprained ankle, Terps running back Josh Allen adeptly filled in, and racked up 257 yards and two touchdowns. Virginia quarterback Matt Schaub threw for a touchdown and ran for another, but his second-half comeback attempt ultimately fell short. In the game, Schaub overtook Shawn Moore's career passing record at the school. There was also some excitement even before the game started. Maryland assistant coach James Franklin and Virginia head coach Al Groh had a heated exchange after a Cavaliers player interrupted the Terps' warm up drills. Then, after Virginia won the coin toss, Al Groh infamously elected to kick off to start "both" halves. Immediately after the decision, the entire Maryland team rushed the field in celebration and was given a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty before the opening kickoff. The win kept the Terps' ACC title hopes alive, but Florida State narrowly beat N.C. State 50–44 to win the conference outright. Maryland finished second-place in the ACC.
2006.
Maryland 28, Virginia 26
After giving up 255 yards, the Terps trailed 20–0 at halftime. Cavaliers punt returner Emmanuel Byers muffed a third-quarter punt to give Maryland possession on the Virginia one-yard line. Lance Ball rushed for a touchdown on the next play, and the Terps went on to score another 21 points in the final quarter to include a 56-yard breakaway by Keon Lattimore and a 45-yard pick-six by linebacker Erin Henderson. With 2:37 left on the clock, the Cavaliers responded with a 44-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Ogletree, to pull to 28–26. Virginia attempted a two-point conversion to send the game into overtime. Cornerback Josh Wilson, who was scored on twice earlier, broke up the pass to clinch the win for the Terps.
2007.
Virginia 18, Maryland 17
Reserve sophomore running back Mikell Simpson racked up 119 yards rushing and two TDs to go along with 152 receiving yards, for 271 all-purpose yards, as 19th-ranked Virginia came from behind to defeat Maryland. The game ended when, with 16 seconds left, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach Ralph Friedgen said "I saw the ball come out on the goal line. I saw it and I don't think he had possession." Simpson himself stated, "It crossed the line. I knew I scored because I looked down and saw the yellow line and I saw the ball cross they hit it out." With the victory, the Cavaliers reached seven wins in a row for the first time since 1990 and for only the fourth time in school history. They also accomplished the feat in 1914 and 1949. That season, Virginia won an NCAA record of five games by two points or less, with the other edged teams being North Carolina, Middle Tennessee State, Connecticut, and Wake Forest.

Melisende of Arsuf

Melisende (born before 1177) was the hereditary Lady of Arsuf from 1177 and the second wife of the powerful nobleman John of Ibelin, the lord of Beirut (1179–1236), who led the opposition to Emperor Frederick II when he tried to impose his authority in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Kingdom of Cyprus.
Family.
She was born sometime before 1177, the eldest daughter of Guy of Arsuf. Her mother's name is unknown. She had a brother, Jean, Lord of Arsuf who married Helvis de Brie. When Jean died childless, Melisende inherited the lordship of Arsuf. She had two younger sisters whose names are not recorded. One married the Chamberlain of Antioch, and the other married Adam of Antioch, by whom she had a son, John, Marshal of Antioch.
Arsuf or Arsur, as it was known by the Crusaders, was a lordship in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Melisende's uncle, Jean of Arsuf is recorded as having subscribed the charter, in 1177, under which King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem donated property to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
Marriages and issue.
On an unknown date, Melisende married firstly Thierry d'Orca, by whom she had seven daughters, all of whom died young. In 1207, she married secondly John of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut, former Constable of Jerusalem, and Regent in Acre for his half-niece Queen Maria. He was the son of Balian of Ibelin and Maria Komnene. His half-sister was Isabella, Queen of Jerusalem. Melisende was his second wife. His first wife, Helvis of Nephim, had died without leaving surviving children.
Upon their marriage, Melisende passed the lordship of Arsuf to John, increasing his territory in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Beirut was effectively an independent state under his rule, while remaining a vassal of the Sovereign. After rebuilding the city which had been destroyed by the forces of Saladin, during the latter's conquest of the Crusader kingdom, Ibelin constructed a magnificent palace.
John of Ibelin and Melisende had six sons and one daughter:
Legacy.
Melisende died on an unknown date. Her husband John of Ibelin died in 1236 when he was crushed by his fallen horse, while on a military campaign against the Muslims.
Melisende had many descendants, some of which included Anne of Lusignan, King Charles VIII of France, Anne of France, and all of the Dukes of Savoy, beginning with Amadeus IX.

Ekkehard V

Ekkehard V (died c. 1220), called "Minimus" (the Least), was a monk of the Abbey of Saint Gall. He is the last of the Saint Gall Ekkehards, and flourished towards the end of the twelfth, and the beginning of the thirteenth, century. No particulars are known concerning his life, and tradition is silent as to his origin, the year of his birth and of his death. He was dean of the abbey in the reign of Innocent III.
About 1214 he wrote a life of St. Notker Balbulus, a learned monk of St. Gall, who lived towards the end of the ninth, and the beginning of the tenth, century (Acta SS., April, I, 579), from which work we gather that its author was versed in ecclesiastical music.

Gen4 Energy

Gen4 Energy, Inc (formerly Hyperion Power Generation, Inc.) is a privately held corporation formed to construct and sell several designs of relatively small (70 MW thermal, 25 MW electric) nuclear reactors, which they claim will be modular, inexpensive, inherently safe, and proliferation-resistant. According to news coverage, these reactors could be used for heat generation, production of electricity, and other purposes, including desalinization.
The company is currently attempting to license their technologies through the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Revised 2009 design: uranium nitride fueled, lead-bismuth cooled reactor.
Hyperion announced in November 2009 that, despite their continued intentions to pursue the self-moderated uranium hydride reactor, urgent customer needs for a rapidly licenseable and deployable reactor are causing them to choose another LANL design for initial commercialization. They are moving forward with a more conventional Generation IV reactor design: a uranium nitride fueled, lead-bismuth cooled reactor. Using a liquid-metal-cooled fast reactor should speed the time to commercialization over the more revolutionary uranium hydride, self-modulating design that had previously been publicly discussed.
[[File:Hyperion Power Facility Concept.jpg|thumb|center|750px|alt=Isometric concept drawing of a power plant of this type, with the reactor module itself within a concrete vault, an intermediate coolant loop emerging from the small modular reactor connected to a pre-heater, an evaporator, and a superheater, water tanks for the tertiary loop as well as water purification and cleanup facilities therefore, as well as a water connection to the reactor vault for residual heat removal (via vault flooding), a steam turbogenerator and relevant appurtenances, electrical switchgear, and a dry cooling tower.|USNRC concept illustration of a Hyperion Power Module plant.]]
Fuel and Coolant Selection.
According to Hyperion, the uranium nitride fuel incorporated in the design is generally similar in physical characteristics and neutronics to the standard ceramic uranium oxide fuel that is used at present in modern light water nuclear reactors. However, it has certain beneficial traits - higher thermal conductivity - and thus less retained heat energy - that make it preferable over oxide fuels when used at temperature regimes that are greater than the temperatures found in light water reactors. By operating at higher temperatures, steam plants can operate at a higher thermal efficiency. The presentation by Hyperion at the ANS 2009 conference mentions the use of the Doppler inherent negative temperature coefficient of reactivity in this reactor as a means of control. Nuclear scientist Alexander Sesonske avers that nitride fuels have both received very little development (as of 1973) and seem to have a very favorable combination of physical properties - especially in fast reactors. Whether this carries over to lead-bismuth cooled reactors is a question not answered in the reviewed literature, though the Soviet Union has worked with this type of reactor before in naval service; in particular, the Alfa class submarine - well known in the West for its high speed operation - was driven by such a lead-bismuth reactor which is known to have worked very effectively.
The Hyperion module has sufficient fuel for 3650 full power days at 70 MWth, is capable of load following, and is meant to be built in pairs; one module can be at power, while another can be under installation or uninstallation at the same time, ensuring reliable supply of electricity.
Thermal Hydraulics, Energy Production and Extraction.
Hyperion plans to use natural circulation of the lead-bismuth coolant through the reactor module as a means of primary cooling. Coolant temperatures within the primary loop should be approximately . Powered intermediate heat exchangers, also using lead-bismuth coolant, are located within the reactor and run an intermediate loop going to a third ex-reactor heat exchanger (the steam generator), where heat is transferred to the working fluid, heating it to approximately . Two schemes of power generation exist at this point: either using superheated steam or supercritical carbon dioxide to drive Rankine cycle or Brayton cycle turbines. In addition to the classical use of power generation, further uses for the heated working fluid can include desalinization, process heat, and district heating and cooling.
The thermal hydraulics of the lead-bismuth reactor are dictated by the high heat capacity and unique properties of the lead-bismuth eutectic coolant. This coolant has several extremely beneficial properties for a reactor: it is opaque to gamma radiation, but transparent to neutron flux; it melts easily at a low temperature, but does not boil until an extremely high temperature is reached; it does not greatly expand or contract when exposed to heat or cold; it has a high heat capacity; it will naturally circulate through the reactor core without pumps being required - whether during normal operation or as a means of residual decay heat removal; and it will solidify once decay heat from a used reactor has dropped to a low level.
Licensing Strategy.
Hyperion intends to pursue the licensing of the uranium nitride, lead-bismuth small reactor with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), though the firm's deployment schedule - the target date for deployment will be by the end of 2013 - as well as indications from senior personnel within Hyperion indicates that perhaps the reactor will bypass the normal NRC process for commercial reactors - as it takes many years - and will instead be initially deployed by the U.S. Department of Energy or the U.S. Department of Defense, not subject to NRC regulation, or that Hyperion will seek a 10CFR50.21 Class 104 Research and Development reactor license from the NRC.
Possibilities for manufacture in nations other than the United States have also been mentioned as a way to overcome the NRC's lesser agility in responding to the commercial introduction of unique and innovative features of this reactor design. In particular, Hyperion plans to manufacture reactors in the United Kingdom, which has demonstrated recent national leadership in the field of nuclear energy, while a yet to be announced nation in Asia is targeted for manufacture as well.

Vista Heights Public School

Vista Heights Public School is an elementary school in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada that offers classes from Kindergarten to Grade 5. Built in 1957 as part of the Vista Heights suburb, the school was originally designed as a Grade 1–6 school for approximately 300 students. It has since undergone several significant expansions(such as adding a new gymnasium and a computer lab), added kindergarten, removed Grade 6, and is now home to approximately 745 students, 457 of whom are enrolled in a French immersion program.
History.
Before 1955, Streetsville was a small rural village built along the Credit River. However, after the Second World War, a burgeoning post-war population looking for new housing convinced developers to build two of the first suburbs in Canada beside Streetsville. One of these was the proposed Vista Heights development, but before the village council would grant approval for it, the councillors made the unprecedented requirement that the developer also had to build a primary public school as part of the development. (Regular practice since then is that the provincial Ministry of Education provides a grant of money to the local school board to build public schools.)
Construction of houses in the Vista Heights area began in 1955, and Vista Heights Public School was subsequently opened in 1957, offering classes for primary grades 1 to 6. In 1961, kindergarten was added to the curriculum.
When it opened, the school was an L-shaped building consisting of about a dozen classrooms and an office, with a small gymnasium at the intersection of the two wings. A swing set, two baseball diamonds and a soccer field provided recreational space for recess. During the winter, an outdoor ice rink was built and maintained by volunteers. (This was discontinued in the 1970s due to warmer winters, but during the winter of 2007, an ice rink was again built on the soccer pitch.)
In the 1980s, the building was enlarged and modified to a C-shape with the addition of another wing, and two of the classrooms were converted into a small library.
In 1980, the school program was modified to offer a French immersion program to about half of the students (360 of 681 in the 2009-2010 school year).
In 1993, Canadian author Eric Walters wrote his first book "Stand Your Ground" about the Grade 5 class he was teaching this year.
In 2005, a much-needed expansion intended to replace the small 1950s-era gymnasium with a larger space and replace several portables on the school grounds with permanent classrooms was announced. Set to be completed by 2007, the project was put on hold while more portables were put in place to accommodate a rapidly growing student body.
In 2006, the school celebrated its 50th birthday with an alumni reunion at which Mississauga Mayor Hazel McCallion recalled the first days of the school.
In 2008, it was announced that Grade 6 would be removed from the curriculum at the end of the 2008–2009 school year. In June 2009, at the request of the students, separate graduation ceremonies were held for the Grade 5 class and the final Grade 6 class.
In 2009, the expansion initiative put on hold three years earlier was recommenced.
In 2013, the annual trip to the Powerade centre for the Forest of Reading Program was cancelled. Instead, Canadian author Eric Walters (once a formal teacher in Vista Heights)author of the Matutu, a silver birch express nominee came to Vista Heights. The presentation was a school day in length. It also included autograph signing, and a free pizza party.
School Hours.
School Starts at 9:10 a.m. and ends at 3:35 p.m.
9:00 a.m.---->supervision begins on the school grounds
9:10 a.m.---->bell rings for start of school

Extra Curriculum Activity.
Vista Heights has some extra curriculum Activity, such as library helpers, bus patrollers, green team and inturmerals.
Library Helpers.
Library Helpers ranged from Grade 4s to Grade 5s
In the year 2012-2013. Grade 5 Library Helpers were supposed to help in the school library at recess at least once a week although they could come more than once per week. They are supposed to have the knowledge of sorting the different types of books. Grade 4 library helpers are to come down at class time and finish off what the grade 5s had started.
Bus Patrollers.
Bus Patrollers are required to know all the safety rules on a bus and what to do in certain situations. They are to go into special training each year with the CAA School Safety patrol. After the training, the students will go through an exam. For those who get 75% or higher will become a bus patroller
Green Team.
The Green Team is responsible to keep the school clean, such as throwing out the trash and recycling. They also hold assemblies talking about the environment and different issues. The green team will be starting to plant a garden in the school.
Intramural.
The school also holds intramural of all kinds. Students will sign up and get assigned a team. The team will be named after a famous team of the sport. Intramurals include, Handball, Floor Hockey, Basketball and more.
Music Program.
Vista Heights currently only has 1 music teacher, called Ms.Demi while the year 2012-2013 had 3 music teachers. The school currently doesn't have any music rooms so the music teacher(s) moves to the classrooms(as of Feb 2014).
Kindergarten.
Currently, there are 3 Kindergarten teachers. Mrs. Greenslade, Mrs. Hobbs, and Mrs. Benoit. 
In Vista Heights, Kindergarten is still half day, which means Kindergarten students only go to school in the morning and get released halfway through the day. The other Kindergarten students go to school in the afternoon and get released at the end of the school day. In the school year 2014-2015, it is planned that all kindergarten students will go full day.
Unlike the U.S., the kindergarten students are divided into JK(junior kindergarten) and SK(junior kindergarten). Kindergarten lasts for 2 years. The expectations for JK and SK students are different.
EQAO.
Vista Heights has a significant amount of students whose scores are above average. In the past 5 years, the EQAO score had increased about 36%

<doc id="20177552" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20177552" title="Transplantable organs and tissues">
Transplantable organs and tissues

Transplantable organs and tissues may both refer to organs and tissues that are relatively often or routinely transplanted (here "main organs and tissues"), as well as relatively seldom transplanted organs and tissues and ones on the experimental stage.
Main organs.
Heart.
"Heart transplantation" is performed on patients with end-stage heart failure or severe coronary artery disease. The most common procedure is to take a working heart from a recently deceased organ donor (allograft) and implant it into the patient. The patient's own heart may either be removed (orthotopic procedure) or, less commonly, left in to support the donor heart (heterotopic procedure). It is also possible to take a heart from another species (xenograft), or implant a man-made artificial one, although the outcome of these two procedures has been less successful in comparison to the far more commonly performed allografts.
Lung.
While lung transplants carry certain associated risks, they can also extend life expectancy and enhance the quality of life for end-stage pulmonary patients.
While the precise details of surgery will depend on the exact type of transplant, there are many steps which are common to all of these procedures. Prior to operating on the recipient, the transplant surgeon inspects the donor lung(s) for signs of damage or disease. If the lung or lungs are approved, then the recipient is connected to an IV line and various monitoring equipment, including pulse oximetry. The patient will be given general anesthesia, and a machine will breathe for him or her.
It takes about one hour for the pre-operative preparation of the patient. A single lung transplant takes about four to eight hours, while a double lung transplant takes about six to twelve hours to complete. A history of prior chest surgery may complicate the procedure and require additional time.
Heart-lung.
A "heart-lung transplant" is a procedure carried out to replace both heart and lungs in a single operation. Due to a shortage of suitable donors, it is a rare procedure; only about a hundred such transplants are performed each year in the USA.
The patient is anesthetised. When the donor organs arrive, they are checked for fitness; if any organs show signs of damage, they are discarded and the operation cancelled. Some patients are concerned that their organs will be removed and the donor organs won't be suitable. Since this is a possibility, it is standard procedure that the patient is not operated on until the donor organs arrive and are judged suitable, despite the time delay this involves.
Once suitable donor organs are present, the surgeon makes an incision starting above and finishing below the sternum, cutting all the way to the bone. The skin edges are retracted to expose the sternum. Using a bone saw, the sternum is cut down the middle. Rib spreaders are inserted in the cut, and spread the ribs to give access to the heart and lungs of the patient.
The patient is connected to a heart-lung machine, which circulates and oxygenates blood. The surgeon removes the failing heart and lungs. Most surgeons endeavour to cut blood vessels as close as possible to the heart to leave room for trimming, especially if the donor heart is of a different size than the original organ.
The donor heart and lungs are positioned and sewn into place. As the donor organs warm up to body temperature, the lungs begin to inflate. The heart may fibrillate at first - this occurs because the cardiac muscle fibres are not contracting synchronously. Internal paddles can be used to apply a small electric shock to the heart to restore proper rhythm.
Once the donor organs are functioning normally, the heart-lung machine is withdrawn, and the chest is closed.
Kidney.
"Kidney transplantation" is the organ transplant of a kidney in a patient with end-stage renal disease. Kidney transplantation is typically classified as deceased-donor (formerly known as cadaveric) or living-donor transplantation depending on the source of the recipient organ. Living-donor renal transplants are further characterized as genetically related (living-related) or non-related (living-unrelated) transplants, depending on whether a biological relationship exists between the donor and recipient.
Liver.
"Liver transplantation" is the replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy liver allograft. The most commonly used technique is orthotopic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and the donor organ is placed in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation nowadays is a well accepted treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure.
Pancreas.
A "pancreas transplant" involves implanting a healthy pancreas (one that can produce insulin) into a person who has diabetes. Because the pancreas performs functions necessary in the digestion process, the recipient's native pancreas is left in place, and the donated pancreas attached in a different location. In the event of rejection of the new pancreas, the recipient could not survive without the native pancreas still in place. The healthy pancreas comes from a donor who has just died or it may be a partial pancreas from a living donor. Whole pancreas transplants from living donors are not possible, again because the pancreas is a necessary organ for digestion. At present, pancreas transplants are usually performed in persons with insulin-dependent diabetes who have severe complications.
Face.
A face transplant is a still-experimental procedure.
In addition to skin, the transplant optimally includes bones, along with muscle, skin, blood vessels and nerves.
Main tissues and cells.
Cornea.
"Corneal transplantation" is a surgical procedure where a damaged or diseased cornea is replaced by donated corneal tissue which has been removed from a recently deceased individual having no known diseases which might affect the viability of the donated tissue. The cornea is the clear part of eye in front of the iris and pupil. The surgical procedure is performed by ophthalmologists, medical doctors who specialize in eyes, and are often done on an outpatient basis (the patient goes home following surgery).
Skin.
Skin grafting is often used to treat:
Skin grafts are often employed after serious injuries when some of the body's skin is damaged. Surgical removal (excision or debridement) of the damaged skin is followed by skin grafting. The grafting serves two purposes: it can reduce the course of treatment needed (and time in the hospital), and it can improve the function and appearance of the area of the body which receives the skin graft.
Hematopoietic stem cells (bone marrow).
"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation" (HSCT) is the transplantation of blood stem cells derived from the bone marrow (that is, "bone marrow transplantation") or blood. Stem cell transplantation is a medical procedure in the fields of hematology and oncology, most often performed for people with diseases of the blood, bone marrow, or certain types of cancer. 
Stem cell transplantation was pioneered using bone-marrow-derived stem cells by a team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center from the 1950s through the 1970s led by E. Donnall Thomas, whose work was later recognized with a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. Thomas' work showed that bone marrow cells infused intravenously could repopulate the bone marrow and produce new blood cells. His work also reduced the likelihood of developing a life-threatening complication called graft-versus-host disease.
The first physician to perform a successful human bone marrow transplant was Robert A. Good.
With the availability of the stem cell growth factors GM-CSF and G-CSF, most hematopoietic stem cell transplantation procedures are now performed using stem cells collected from the peripheral blood, rather than from the bone marrow. Collecting peripheral blood stem cells provides a bigger graft, does not require that the donor be subjected to general anesthesia to collect the graft, results in a shorter time to engraftment, and may provide for a lower long-term relapse rate.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains a risky procedure with many possible complications; it has traditionally been reserved for patients with life-threatening diseases. While occasionally used experimentally in nonmalignant and nonhematologic indications such as severe disabling auto-immune disease and cardiovascular disease, the risk of fatal complications appears too high to gain wider acceptance.
Blood.
"Blood transfusion" is the process of transferring blood or blood-based products from one person into the circulatory system of another. Blood transfusions can be life-saving in some situations, such as massive blood loss due to trauma, or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery. Blood transfusions may also be used to treat a severe anaemia or thrombocytopenia caused by a blood disease. People suffering from hemophilia or sickle-cell disease may require frequent blood transfusions. Early transfusions used Whole Blood, but modern medical practice is to use only components of the blood.
Other organs.
Hands.
The operation is carried out in the following order: bone fixation, tendon repair, artery repair, nerve repair, then vein repair. The operation typically lasts 8 to 12 hours. By comparison, a typical heart transplant operation lasts 6 to 8 hours.
The recipient of a hand transplant needs to take immunosuppressive drugs, as the body's natural immune system will try to reject, or destroy, the hand. These drugs cause the recipient to have a weak immune system and suffer severely even from minor infections.
In 2008, surgeons in Munich transplanted two whole arms. The long term results remain to be seen.
Leg.
In ischiopagic conjoined twins, a healthy leg was transplanted from a dying conjoined twin to her sister. There is no need for immunosuppression because of the identical genetic make-up of the donor and recipient.
The first allograft of a leg is scheduled for Summer 2010.
Penis.
The penis may be an allograft from a human donor, or it may be grown artificially, though the latter is untested in humans. Peripheral transplant procedures such as hand, face, or penis transplant surgery are controversial because they are not necessary to ensure the life of the patient.
Bone.
"Bone grafting" is a surgical procedure that replaces missing bone with material from the patient's own body, an artificial, synthetic, or natural substitute. Bone grafting is used to repair bone fractures that are extremely complex, pose a significant health risk to the patient, or fail to heal properly.
Uterus.
A "uterine transplant" is the replace an uterus which has undergone necrosis. Though the procedure has significant potential, it has been performed only a few times.
Small bowel.
"Small bowel transplantation" (SBT) was carried out 180 times in 2009 in the United States. Currently, approximately half are pediatric recipients. The most common indications in adults are ischemia (22%), Crohn's disease (13%), trauma (12%), and desmoid tumor (10%); and in pediatrics, gastroschisis (21%), volvulus (18%), and necrotizing enterocolitis (12%). Higher graft and patient survival rates are seen at the more experienced transplant programs. Within the last few years, 1-year graft and patient survival at more experienced centers have reached 60% to 70% and 65% to 80%, respectively.
Thymus.
Thymus transplantation can be used to treat infants with DiGeorge syndrome, which results in an absent or hypoplastic thymus, in turn causing problems with the immune system's T-cell mediated response. It is exclusively used in people with complete DiGeorge anomaly, which are entirely athymic. This subgroup represents less than 1% of DiGeorge syndrome patients.
Other cells and tissues.
Islets of Langerhans.
Islet cell transplantation has the possibility of restoring beta cells and curing diabetes. 
The Chicago Project headed at University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center is investigating ways to regenerate beta cells "in vivo". With that being said, beta cells experience apoptosis early and thus are destroyed within a normal-functioning pancreas. The source of this seems to come from the transfer of Pander, a gene that works by attaching to RNA. Pander, when active, causes the beta cells to be blocked at S phase, which induces apoptosis. This loss of beta cell mass eventually leads to a loss of most of the transplanted beta cells.
Heart valve.
"Biological valves" are valves of animals, like pigs, which undergo several chemical procedures in order to make them suitable for implantation in the human heart. The porcine (or pig) heart is most similar to the human heart, and therefore represents the best anatomical fit for replacement. Implantation of a porcine valve is a type of Xenotransplantation, or Xenograft, which means a transplant from one species (in this case a pig) to another. There are some risks associated with a Xenograft such as the human body's tendency to reject foreign material. Medication can be used to retard this effect, but is not always successful.
Ovary.
Ovary transplantation, giving rise to successful pregnancies, has so far only been carried out on identical twins, and will result in children who will have the genetic inheritance of the organ donor and not the recipient. More importantly, use of an ovarian transplant from a genetically identical donor prevents rejection of the donated organ. This bypasses the need for immune suppressants to maintain the function of the donated ovary, which is not vital for survival. More significantly, many immunosuppressants, such as mycophenolate mofetil, may cause birth defects.

Mel languages

The Mel languages are a branch of Niger–Congo languages spoken in Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The most populous is Temne, with about two million speakers; Kissi is next, with half a million.
Languages.
Mel has traditionally been classified as the bulk of a southern branch of a West Atlantic branch of Niger–Congo. However, these are geographic and typological rather than genealogical groups; Segerer (2010) shows that there is no exclusive relationship between Mel and the other southern languages, Gola and Limba.

<doc id="20177574" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20177574" title="Antiresonance">
Antiresonance

In the physics of coupled oscillators, antiresonance, by analogy with resonance, is a pronounced minimum in the amplitude of one oscillator at a particular frequency, accompanied by a large shift in its oscillation phase. Such frequencies are known as the system's antiresonant frequencies, and at these frequencies the oscillation amplitude can drop to almost zero. Antiresonances are caused by destructive interference, for example between an external driving force and interaction with another oscillator.
Antiresonances can occur in all types of coupled oscillator systems, including mechanical, acoustic, electromagnetic and quantum systems. They have important applications in the characterization of complex coupled systems.
Antiresonance in coupled oscillators.
The simplest system in which antiresonance arises is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators, for example pendula or RLC circuits.
Consider two harmonic oscillators coupled together with strength formula_1 and with one oscillator driven by an oscillating external force formula_2. The situation is described by the coupled ordinary differential equations
where the formula_4 represent the resonance frequencies of the two oscillators and the formula_5 their damping rates. Changing variables to the complex parameters formula_6, formula_7 allows us to write these as first-order equations:
We transform to a frame rotating at the driving frequency formula_9, yielding
where we have introduced the detunings formula_11 between the drive and the oscillators' resonance frequencies. Finally, we make a rotating wave approximation, neglecting the fast counter-rotating terms proportional to formula_12, which average to zero over the timescales we are interested in (this approximation assumes that formula_13, which is reasonable for small frequency ranges around the resonances). Thus we obtain:
Without damping, driving or coupling, the solutions to these equations are formula_15, which represent a rotation in the complex formula_16 plane with angular frequency formula_17.
The steady-state solution can be found by setting formula_18, which gives:
Examining these steady state solutions as a function of driving frequency, it is evident that both oscillators display resonances (peaks in amplitude accompanied by positive phase shifts) at the two normal mode frequencies. In addition, the driven oscillator displays a pronounced dip in amplitude between the normal modes which is accompanied by a negative phase shift. This is the antiresonance. Note that there is no antiresonance in the undriven oscillator's spectrum; although its amplitude has a minimum between the normal modes, there is no pronounced dip or negative phase shift.
Interpretation as destructive interference.
The reduced oscillation amplitude at an antiresonance can be regarded as due to destructive interference or cancellation of forces acting on the oscillator.
In the above example, at the antiresonance frequency the external driving force formula_2 acting on oscillator 1 cancels the force acting via the coupling to oscillator 2, causing oscillator 1 to remain almost stationary.
Complex coupled systems.
The frequency response function (FRF) of any linear dynamic system composed of many coupled components will in general display distinctive resonance-antiresonance behavior when driven.
As a rule of thumb, it can be stated that as the distance between the driven component and the measured component increases, the number of antiresonances in the FRF decreases. For example, in the two-oscillator situation above, the FRF of the undriven oscillator displayed no antiresonance. Resonances and antiresonances only alternate continuously in the FRF of the driven component itself.
Applications.
An important result in the theory of antiresonances is that they can be interpreted as the resonances of the system fixed at the excitation point. This can be seen in the pendulum animation above: the steady-state antiresonant situation is the same as if the left pendulum were fixed and could not oscillate. An important corollary of this result is that the antiresonances of a system are independent of the properties of the driven oscillator; i.e. they do not change if the resonance frequency or damping coefficient of the driven oscillator are altered.
This result makes antiresonances useful in characterizing complex coupled systems which cannot be easily separated into their constituent components. The resonance frequencies of the system depend on the properties of all components and their couplings, and are independent of which is driven. The antiresonances, on the other hand, are independent of the component being driven, therefore providing information about how it affects the total system. By driving each component in turn, information about all of the individual subsystems can be obtained, despite the couplings between them. This technique has applications in mechanical engineering, structural analysis, and the design of integrated quantum circuits.
Other uses.
In electrical engineering, the word antiresonance may also be used to refer to the condition for which the impedance of an electrical circuit is very high, approaching infinity.
In an electric circuit consisting of a capacitor and an inductor in parallel, antiresonance occurs when the alternating current line voltage and the resultant current are in phase. Under these conditions the line current is very small because of the high electrical impedance of the parallel circuit at antiresonance. The branch currents are almost equal in magnitude and opposite in phase.
The principle of antiresonance is used in wave traps, which are sometimes inserted in series with antennas of radio receivers to block the flow of alternating current at the frequency of an interfering station, while allowing other frequencies to pass.

Ke-mo sah-bee

Ke-mo sah-bee (; often spelled kemo sabe or kemosabe) is the term of endearment and catchphrase used by the intrepid and ever-faithful fictional Native American sidekick Tonto, in the very successful American radio and television program "The Lone Ranger".
Ultimately derived from "giimoozaabi", an Ojibwe and Potawatomi word that probably meant "scout", it is sometimes translated as "trusty scout" or "faithful friend". Its use has become so widespread that it was entered into "Webster's New Millennium Dictionary" in 2002.
In the 2013 film "The Lone Ranger", Tonto states that it means "wrong brother" in Comanche.
Spelling.
Fran Striker, writer of the original "Lone Ranger" radio program, spelled the word "ke-mo sah-bee." However, the spelling "kemo sabe" (or "kemosabe") is by far the most common in popular culture, receiving approximately 180,000 hits on Google search in April 2011, as opposed to "ke-mo sah-bee'"s 15,800. The word was entered into "Webster's New Millennium Dictionary" (edited by Barbara Ann Kipfer) in 2002 under the spelling "kemosabe."
Meaning and origin.
There are many theories about the origin and meaning of this word. A common story is that it derives from a Spanish phrase such as "Quien sabe" or "quien no sabe," meaning "who knows?" or "he who does not know". This is implausible because Jim Jewell, director of "The Lone Ranger" from 1933 to 1939, took the phrase from Kamp Kee-Mo Sah-Bee, a boys' camp on Mullett Lake established by Charles W. Yeager (Jewell's father-in-law) in 1916. Yeager himself probably took the term from Ernest Thompson Seton, one of the founders of the Boy Scouts of America, who had given the meaning "scout runner" to "Kee-mo-sah'-bee" in his 1912 book "The Book of Woodcraft and Indian Lore".
Kamp Kee-Mo Sah-Bee was in an area inhabited by the Ottawa, who spoke a dialect of Ojibwe. John D. Nichols and Earl Nyholm's "A Concise Dictionary of Minnesota Ojibwe" defines the Ojibwe word "giimoozaabi" as "he peeks" (and, in theory, "he who peeks"), making use of the prefix "giimoo(j)-", "secretly"; Rob Malouf, now an associate professor of linguistics at San Diego State University, suggested that "giimoozaabi" may indeed have also meant scout (i.e., "one who sneaks"). 
The etymology provided by "Webster's New Millennium Dictionary" is, "Has various meanings in Native American languages."

Alexander H. Smith

Alexander Hanchett Smith (December 12, 1904 – December 12, 1986) was an American mycologist known for his extensive contributions to the taxonomy and phylogeny of the higher fungi, especially the agarics.
Early life.
Smith, born in Crandon, Wisconsin, was the second child of Ruth M. and Edward A. Schmidt, who later changed their name to Smith. After the death of his mother in his teens, Smith and family moved to West De Pere, Wisconsin, to live with their paternal grandparents.
Education.
Smith graduated from high school in West De Pere in 1923. A year later, he entered Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin, where he received a B.A. degree in 1928. He applied for a fellowship at the University of Michigan and began graduate studies in botany in the fall of 1928 with the eminent mycologist Calvin H. Kauffman as his advisor. Kauffman died before Smith completed his degree, so he continued his studies under professor Edwin Butterworth Mains, eventually earning his M.A. in 1929 and his Ph.D. in 1933. His doctoral dissertation was entitled "Investigations of Two-spored Forms in the Genus "Mycena"", which was later published as a journal article.
Career.
In 1934 he was appointed Assistant Curator at the University of Michigan Herbarium, where he was to spend his entire professional career. He was appointed Director of the Herbarium in 1959 and served in this capacity until 1972. In 1968, he served as Deputy Director of the Biological Station. Smith married fellow graduate student Helen Vendler Smith, who received her Ph.D. in botany at the University of Michigan. They would work together later, she co-authoring and illustrating some of his publications. Daughter Nancy, born in 1943, would accompany her parents on mycological expeditions and forays. Following in her parent's footsteps, she also completed a doctorate at the University of Michigan, in mycology.
Smith was President of the Mycological Society of America, and from 1945 to 1950 served as editor of the scientific journal "Mycologia" in 1950. He was President of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters, the Michigan Academy (1966–67), the Michigan Botanical Club, the Torrey Botanical Club, and the Research Club of the University of Michigan in 1974–75.
Smith taught formal courses at the University in Ann Arbor in addition to summer field courses at the University of Michigan Biological Station at Douglas Lake, Michigan. Additionally, he supervised nine Ph.D. graduate students, some of whom, such as Harry D. Thiers and Orson K. Miller, would become recognized mycologists in their own right.
During the course of 57 years of field work, Smith accumulated over 100,000 collections of fungal samples, and an extensive library of photographs. Today these are located in the University of Michigan Herbarium.
High standards.
Smith maintained high scientific standards in his publications; he once wrote 
I personally feel that as mycologists we can never arrive at truly accurate generic concepts and correct names for them unless the pertinent facts are accurately stated. It is next to impossible to avoid bias in taxonomic work, but information should be "slanted" as little as possible. Other contemporary authors that did not meet these standards would often suffer censure by Smith in book reviews or articles. For example, in a book review about a then-recent publication on wood-decay fungi, he wrote:
In a work of this type the author should have recognized his duty to give his readers and users the best of modern classifications and nomenclature. In this respect he failed completely. ...The agaric part of the work is full of contradictions based on the author's failure to consider work of the last 30 years." Later he writes 
Perhaps the best that can be said for the work editorially is that fortunately there is very little introductory material to confuse the reader."
In another article, commenting about "the current low degree of accuracy developing in the literature on hallucinogenic mushrooms generally", Smith pointed out numerous errors in two current publications, such as ambiguously written text, mistakes in citations, lack of scientific rigor in presenting arguments, unreliability of data due to inadequate sampling procedures, and inadequate searches of available literature. Smith would soon collaborate with one of these authors in a publication the next year.
Publications.
Smith published nearly 200 articles and books about fungi, including many books as monographs or various genera of higher fungi. He also wrote for the casual mushroom enthusiast; in particular, his field guide "The Mushroom Hunter's Field Guide" garnered several excellent reviews and sold over 100,000 copies.

Monographs
Selected journal articles
Honors and awards.
Several fungal taxa have been named in honor of Smith, including: "Smithiogaster" Wright; "Smithiomyces" Singer; "Agaricus smithii" Kerrigan; "Agrocybe smithii"; "Alpova alexsmithii" Trappe (now "Rhizopogon alexsmithii"); "Amanita smithiana" Bas; "Boletopsis smithii" K.A.Harrison; "Boletus smithii" Thiers; and "Astraeus smithii".

Senegambian languages

The Senegambian languages are a branch of Niger–Congo languages centered on Senegal (and Senegambia), with most languages spoken there and in neighboring southern Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea. The transhumant Fula, howewever, have spread with their languages from Senegal across the western and central Sahel. The most populous unitary language is Wolof, the national language of Senegal, with four million native speakers and millions more second-language users. There are perhaps 13 million speakers of the various varieties of Fula, and over a million speakers of Serer. A special feature of the Senegambian languages not found outside the group is its non-tonality.
Classification.
Sapir (1971) proposed a West Atlantic branch of the Niger–Congo languages that included a Northern branch largely synonymous with Senegambian. However, Sapir's West Atlantic and its branches turned out to be geographic and typological rather than genealogical groups. The only investigation since then, Segerer (2010), removed the Bak languages from Sapir's Northern West Atlantic but found that the remaining languages, Senegambian (Serer–Fulani–Wolof), to be a valid group, characterized by consonant mutation:
The Fula–Tenda languages all have implosive consonants, while Serer and Fula share noun-class suffixes. Several classifications, including the one used by "Ethnologue" 17, show Fula as being more closely related to Wolof than it is to Serer. However, this is due to a misreading of Sapir's data by Wilson (1989).
Consonant mutation.
The Senegamibian languages are well known for their consonant mutation, a phenomenon in which the initial consonant of a word change depending on its morphological and/or syntactic environment. In Fula, for example, the initial consonant of many nouns changes depending on whether it is singular or plural:
Noun classes.
The West Atlantic languages are defined by their noun-class systems, which are similar to those found in other Niger–Congo languages, most famously the Bantu languages. Most West Atlantic, and indeed Niger–Congo, noun-class systems are marked with prefixes, and linguists generally believe that this reflects the proto-Niger–Congo system. The languages of the Fula–Serer branch of Senegambian, however, have noun-class "suffixes", or combinations of prefixes and suffixes. Joseph Greenberg argued that the suffixed forms arose from independent post-posed determiners that agreed with the noun class:

Iliff David Richardson

Iliff David "Rich" Richardson (April 9, 1918, Denver, Colorado - October 10, 2001, Houston Texas) was simultaneously a US Navy Ensign and a US Army Major whilst fighting with the Philippine resistance during World War II. He recounted his exploits to author Ira Wolfert, who published them in the book "American Guerrilla in the Philippines" in 1945. A character based on Richardson was played by Tyrone Power in the 1950 film of the same name.
Biography.
Early life.
Richardson was the only surviving child of Methodist Minister Royal Richardson, who died when Iliff was three years old. His mother Velma Weston Richardson taught Latin and music and raised Iliff in a variety of Colorado towns and her father's Nebraska ranch. After his death, the Richardsons went to live in Los Angeles. 
Iliff studied at Compton Junior College, then travelled through Europe, the Near and Middle East, returning to the US after the fall of France in World War II.
Wartime career.
In 1940 he was commissioned an Ensign in the US Navy and was posted to the USS "Bittern", a minesweeper in the Philippines. He later transferred to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, commanded by John D. Bulkeley. Richardson was the executive officer of "PT 34". After it was sunk by the Japanese, Richardson served with the US Army, setting off demolition charges in Cebu City. 
Richardson and a dozen Americans attempted to sail a native outrigger to Australia, but the boat was sunk in a storm. Richardson swam for 24 hours to the island of Mindanao, where he was chased by the Japanese. The men eventually joined the Philippine guerrilla forces. Richardson, a former ham radio operator, set up a radio network to keep the various bands in touch with each other and Allied forces in Australia. For his work, Richardson was made a US Army Intelligence major by General Douglas MacArthur, holding commissions in the army and navy simultaneously. He is the only person to receive consecutive medals in both the Army and the Navy.
Memoirs.
After the liberation of the Philippines, Richardson transcribed his memoirs to Pulitzer Prize-winning war correspondent and author Ira Wolfert of the North American Newspaper Alliance. Wolfert turned it into a book, "An American Guerrilla in the Philippines", which became both a Book-of-the-Month Club selection and a condensed book in the March 1945 "Readers Digest". Darryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century Fox bought the film rights and had Lamar Trotti write a screenplay by August 1945. The end of the war led Zanuck to shelve all films with a World War II theme. It was eventually made five years after the end of the war. The name of the central character was changed to "Chuck Palmer" and he was given a fictional love-interest for dramatic purposes.
Post-war career.
Following the war, Richardson married Coma Noel and lived in Houston, Texas, where he worked as a business executive, life insurance salesman and a consultant, as well as acting as technical advisor for several Hollywood films.
Richardson also attempted to manufacture and sell a single shot slamfire "Philippine Guerrilla Gun" shotgun through his Richardson Industries in New Haven, Connecticut, that he set up in 1946. With a wide variety of shotguns brought back from Europe and American manufactured weapons, it did not sell very well. Thomas F. Swearingen noted in his book "World's Fighting Shotguns", "The American market would not tolerate such a primitive firearm, even as a curio." 
Many years later, Richardson told a meeting of Eagle Scouts that he learned how to live as a guerrilla through his days in Los Angeles Boy Scout Troop 92.

List of Witch Hunter Robin characters

The anime series "Witch Hunter Robin" featured an extensive cast of fictional characters designed by Kumiko Takahashi. The series takes place on a fictional modern-day Earth where the Solomon organization fights the harmful use of witchcraft using a database of witches, those who have obtained the power of witchcraft through genetics, and those who carry the gene called "seeds" in order to arrest them or to employ Hunters, people who hunt witches, should their powers "awaken". 
The series' titular character is Robin Sena, a soft-spoken 15-year-old Hunter and witch with pyrokinetic abilities. She is sent to Solomon's Japanese branch, the STN-J. There she meets five other Hunters: Amon, Haruto Sakaki, Michael Lee, Miho Karasuma and Yurika Dōjima. The antagonists include Takuma Zaizen, administrator of the STN-J. As the series progresses, Robin's witch power strengthens and she is hunted by the Solomon organization.
Other characters.
Master.
, commonly called is the calm and polite proprietor of "Harry's", a cafe frequented by Robin and the rest of the series' main cast. His son, Yukata, is a witch and it is hinted that Master has "awakened" as well. He usually provides the Hunters with information that he manages to pick up from his customers. He takes a special interest in Robin, looking out for her and preparing food for her when she cannot come to the bar. Near the series' conclusion, he empathizes with her troubles and welcomes her "home." 
Grand Inquisitor Cortion.
Grand Inquisitor Cortion is an Inquisitor sent from Solomon to perform an inquisition on the craft-user Shiro Masudo in the episode "The Eyes of Truth." Karasuma explains to Sakaki that Solomon uses a human Inquisitor to make the final decision whether a craft-user/witch can be a hunter or not. Amon and Robin escort Cortion to the church he will be staying, and a discussion between the Inquisitor and Robin reveals that he performed Robin's Inquisition. As Cortion is leaving to return to HQ after the Inquisition, he tells Robin they will probably never meet again and alludes to the fact that she has awakened to "the pleasure of using her craft." 
Father Juliano Colegui.
Father Juliano Colegui is a Roman Catholic priest and Robin's former guardian, he is also her maternal grandfather who raised her from birth. In the beginning of the series, Robin mentions that his powers have diminished, suggesting that he was once a craft user for Solomon, although it is never stated what his specific craft was. Since he and Robin are related, its probable that he was a fire craft user like Robin. He visits Robin in the latter part of the series to inform her about the events surrounding her past. During the times Robin stays with Nagira, he is the one who asks Amon to hunt Robin, for fear that she wouldn't be able to control her powers as they grew stronger. Later, in "Redemption Day" he confronts Robin himself, and sees that she has not changed, nor turned into the monster he feared her to be. He asks her forgiveness and blesses her, giving her the information taken from Todo's journal that will help her choose her path, and entrusts her to her own destiny, knowing she will choose the right actions. 
Hiroshi Tōdō.
Hiroshi Tōdō is Robin's "father", the brilliant scientist who designed her genes and artificially inseminated her within Maria. He researched a new project to repair the conflicts between humans and witches, however all evidence of his research was destroyed by Solomon because of the potential danger it contained, although it was far too late as the project had already reached its final stages. He entrusted Juliano with Robin's care, after Maria's death, gambling that Juliano would let her live. In the last episode, a recording of him is displayed on a computer in The Factory, explaining everything about his project, Robin's origins and potential, and the origins of Solomon's fear of witches (much to Zaizan's dismay). 
Maria Colegui.
Maria Colegui is the daughter of Father Juliano and is also Robin's mother, although not by a standard means of birth. She passed her power of pyrokinesis to Robin, stating that Robin is the "Hope" for the future of the well-being of all witches, as well as the key to solving the struggle of acceptance between witches and humans. After giving birth to Robin, Maria died.
Reception.
The characters of "Witch Hunter Robin" have received praise and criticism from several publications for anime, manga, and other media. Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network notes that the character designs fit well with series' visual style and the characters' expression were convincing. Jason Bustard from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews comments that the characters are a "mixed bunch". The main cast is said to have "distinct and fully rendered personalities", all of which are well-done. Character interaction is fun, but characterization sometimes falls into cliché. Tasha Robinson of Sci Fi Channel's "Sci Fi Weekly" commented that it was difficult to decide who to "root for" as the witches seemed to be insane killers, but the protagonists were "killers of a colder, more controlled stripe" and were generally unpleasant, with the exceptions of Karasuma and Zaizen. She also says that the characters give no indication to why they work for the STN. Robin and Amon's character designs are said to be strange.

Paul Kornfeld (playwright)

Paul Kornfeld (11 December 1889—25 April 1942) was a Czech-born German-language Jewish writer whose expressionist plays and scholarly treatises on the theory of drama earned him a specialized niche in influencing contemporary intellectual discourse.
Writing career before and after World War I.
A native of Prague, Paul Kornfeld came to adulthood in the city which, as the capital of Bohemia, was, at the time, a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and a major center of culture and learning. In 1913, at the age of 23, he formulated a thesis elucidating his philosophy of dramaturgy, "Der beseelte und der psychologische Mensch" ["The Spiritual and the Psychological Person", also translated as "The Inspired and the Psychological Being"] and wrote the first draft of his most-renowned play, "Die Verführung" ["The Seduction"]. His circle of young friends and compatriots included some of the most renowned German-speaking Jewish literary figures of the era, Oskar Baum, Max Brod, Rudolf Fuchs, Willy Haas, Franz Janowitz, Franz Kafka, Egon Erwin Kisch, Otto Pick, Hermann Ungar, Johannes Urzidil and Franz Werfel.
In 1916, amidst the chaos of World War I and, with ultimate birth of the future republic of Czechoslovakia only two years away, Kornfeld moved to Germany where, during the Weimar period, he experienced his most intense period of creativity. In 1918, during the final months of the war, he published a revised version of his thesis and oversaw the first production of "Die Verführung". An expressionist work, which put forth abstract and revisionist ideas, it attempted to encapsulate the universality of human aspiration. Character development and plot details were eschewed in favor of an atmosphere of hopeless inability to cope, which defeated the play's tragic protagonist. A subsequent expressionist drama, "Himmel und Holle" ["Heaven and Hell"] presented even more abstract ideas, but in a vein that was, to a greater degree, lyrical and ecstatic.
Kornfeld also wrote satirical comedies which did not utilize expressionism and showed him in possession of a highly developed sense of humor. "Der ewige Traum" ["The Eternal Dream"] (1922), which held up a jaundiced mirror to reflect upon monogamous and polygamous relationships, "Palme, oder Der Gekränkte" ["Palme, or The Offended One"] (1924), which spotlighted a character of comically extreme sensitivity and "Kilian, oder Die gelbe Rose" ["Kilian, or The Yellow Rose"] (1926), all enjoyed audience approval as did his collaboration with Max Reinhardt on a 1925 Berlin theatrical production. Written in 1929 and staged in 1930, his final Berlin play, "Jud Süß" ["Suss, the Jew", generally known under its literal translation, "Jew Suss"], presented a highly nuanced and objective portrayal of the controversial 18th century Jewish financier Joseph Süß Oppenheimer whose story had already been depicted a century earlier in Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella and, again, only four years before his own work, in Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 historical novel. Within a decade, it also became the subject of a 1934 British film starring Conrad Veidt, and a notorious 1940 German anti-semitic propaganda film with Ferdinand Marian in the title role.
Hitler era and death.
Hitler's coming to power in 1933 put an end to Kornfeld's Berlin odyssey and forced him back to Prague, no longer a gathering hub of German-language culture, but, since October 1918, the capital of the new republic of Czechoslovakia. His subsequent literary output greatly decreased and he began work on what turned out to be his only novel, "Blanche oder Das Atelier im Garten" or The Studio in the Garden, which was not published until 1957, fifteen years after its author's death. Shortly after completing it, in 1941, he was taken into custody by the German authorities administering occupied Prague, and transported to Ghetto Litzmannstadt, the name given during the German occupation to a section of Łódź, Poland's second-largest city (since 2007, third-largest). Between 1939 and 1944, over 200,000 Jews and a small number of Romani passed through the ghetto, an area of 4 sq. kilometers, of which only 2.4 kilometers were developed and habitable. Fuel supplies were extremely limited, and the inhabitants burned whatever they could to survive the harsh winter. Some 18,000 died during a famine in 1942, one of them Paul Kornfeld. He was 52 years old. Through the passing decades, his literary output has remained, for the most part, neglected, although a critical edition, "Paul Kornfeld: Revolution mit Flötenmusik und andere kritische Prosa" ["Paul Kornfeld: Revolution with Flute Music and Other Critical Prose"], was issued in 1977.

The Digital Storage Systems Interconnect (DSSI) is a bus developed by Digital Equipment Corporation for connecting storage devices and clustering VAX systems and support was extended to MIPS based DECsystem and later to Alpha processor based AlphaServer systems.
It was introduced in 1988 and has a bandwidth of 32 Mbit/s and was typically limited to a length of 25 meters.
DSSI peripherals could be distinguished from narrow SCSI devices by their characteristic five conductor power connector featuring an extra lead intended for Battery/UPS connection to power critical components in the event of a power failure.
Characteristics.
The major characteristics of the DSSI bus are:
Third Party Peripherals.
Other companies, such as CMD and Symbios Logic made DSSI compatible chipsets or peripherals, for example,
CMD manufactured various models of the CDI-4000 which would allow SCSI peripherals to be used on a DSSI bus.

AMN082

AMN082 (N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride) is a selective metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7) allosteric agonist. It mimics the effect of glutamate. AMN082 is the first selective mGluR7 agonist and has expanded the potential array of research opportunities on the effects of mGluR7 in the CNS.
Significance.
The two main types of glutamate receptors are ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic receptors (iGluRs) are fast-acting ligand-gated ion channels and include AMPA, Kainate and NMDA. Metabotropic receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that mediate slower, longer lasting effects through second messenger systems and are responsible for other neuronal functions that are not typically controlled by iGluRs. mGluRs are split into 3 separate groups (Group I, Group II, Group III) based on pharmacological profile, sequence homology, and preferred signal transduction pathway. mGlur7 is a member of Group III, the least studied of the groups. The discovery of AMN082 will serve as a useful pharmacological tool to expand research on Group III mGluRs.

Oh How We Danced

Oh How We Danced is the debut studio album by the British musician Jim Capaldi.
The album was recorded while Traffic was on hiatus due to Steve Winwood's struggles with peritonitis, and released by Island Records in 1972. Like his contemporary albums with Traffic, it was unsuccessful in his native United Kingdom but did better in the USA, reaching number 82 in the Billboard 200 and producing the hit single "Eve", which reached number 91 in the Billboard Hot 100.
The track "Open Your Heart" is a surplus recording from Traffic's then most recent album, "The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys". All of the remaining tracks, save "How Much Can a Man Really Take?", were recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section.
Reception.
Critical reception for "Oh How We Danced" was resoundingly positive. "Rolling Stone" applauded Capaldi's clever yet earnest lyrics and the strong collection of guest musicians, concluding that the album has "Not a whiff of mediocrity to be heard." Allmusic's retrospective review complimented the strong set of songs and "its mellow vibe, generated by the genial familiarity of the players". They also made note of "Capaldi's sweet, unassuming voice", an echo of "Rolling Stone's" reference to his "sweet smooth easy voice."
Track listing.
All tracks composed by Jim Capaldi, except where indicated.
One further track, "Going Down Slow All the Way", was recorded at an unidentified studio in England and released as the b-side to the single "Eve". The track features only piano, tambourine, bass drum, and a single vocal, all presumably played by Jim Capaldi, who produced the track by himself.

TiLR

TiLR is the world's first enterprise-grade telepresence robot developed by RoboDynamics Corporation. The Telepresence internet-connected Low cost Robot (TiLR) enables a user to instantly transport to a remote location whereby the robot would embody the user in the remote location. The advantage of Robotic Telepresence is reduced travel and downtime as well as increase throughput and collaboration.
Description.
TiLR is essentially a video conferencing system on wheels. But unlike video conferencing however, the user is able to commandeer the robot by remote control: driving the robot and control the Pan/Tilt/Zoom function of the robot's camera. As such TiLR provides a means for "frictionless ad hoc face-to-face" conversations as well as audio and visual monitoring from remote.
Development.
TiLR was introduced in late 2007 by RoboDynamics following the MILO telepresence platform which was introduced in 2004. This makes TiLR a 14th generation telepresence robot developed by RoboDynamics. In August 2008 RoboDynamics kicked off their Beta Program by placing robots into various organizations in exchange for feedback.

Rockie Gardiner

Rochelle "Rockie" Gardiner was an American astrologer. Her syndicated astrology column, "The Rockie Horoscope", appeared in a variety of publications (mostly alternative weekly newspapers), on her own website, and she also gave custom astrological readings for individuals.
Background.
She was born in 1938 in Brooklyn, New York and raised in Lawrence, New York on Long Island. Ms. Gardiner was a Sagittarius. She attended Syracuse University and graduated from Barnard College. Following graduation she worked as an editor of children's books at Doubleday Publishing where she worked with such well-known established writers such as Arthur Miller and Shirley Jackson.
In 1958 she married Peter Gardiner, a pioneering film director of psychedelic "pop films" that were predecessors to music videos. Peter and Rockie had a son, Jeremy, born in 1963 and in 1966 the small Gardiner family moved to Los Angeles, California where Rockie discovered an interest in astrology. Peter died in 1968 and Rockie remained single the rest of her life.

John Daly (gambler)

John Daly (1838 – April 26, 1906) was an American sportsman, professional gambler and underworld figure in New York during the late 19th century. A protégé of John Morrissey, he was involved in illegal gambling in Broadway and Midtown Manhattan for over thirty years. He was also among the principal rivals of "Honest" John Kelly up until the turn of the 20th century and was considered one of the most successful and wealthiest gamblers in New York at the time of his death.
Biography.
John Daly was born in Troy, New York in 1838. He became interested in gambling at an early age spending much of his time at the local gambling house, one of many owned by sportsman John Morrissey, with whom he soon became acquainted. Daly became a protege of his and was eventually brought to New York where he earned a small fortune by the late 1860s. He owned a number of establishments, such as the "Long Branch Club" in Long Branch, New Jersey; however, his popular Broadway gaming resort was the one that he was most associated with. Daly later moved his gambling operations uptown and, in 1885, opened "John Daly's" at West Twenty-Ninth Street, which became nationally known and one of the most popular spots in the city during the next twenty years.
Thoroughbred racing.
Daly was also involved in horseracing during this time and was considered one of the biggest operators in the race-track betting rings in the country. He also raced horses, both alone and with partners, before forming a partnership with David Gideon in 1891. In their first year, they won the Futurity Stakes with His Highness and would dominate the competition for another four years. They twice won the Futurity with The Butterflies (1894) and Requital (1895) as well as the Suburban Handicap with Ramapo. The firm "Gideon & Daly" established a breeding farm near Red Bank, New Jersey called the "Homdel Stud", but the property was leased when Daly retired from horse racing. Daly had mixed success in this enterprise, having lost a lot of money on both betting on the races and in the stock market.
John Daly was associated with many political and underworld figures in his lifetime but was reportedly far closer to fellow sportsmen gamblers such as William Busteed, Sam Emery, Davy Johnson, Dinky Davis, and Richard Canfield, his eventual successor. His establishments were sometimes subjected to police raids, and Daly was alleged to have paid protection money as high as $100,000 a week to the New York Police Department, which led to his later involvement in the Lexow Committee investigations. Daly was described as "a man of quiet, engaging manners" and regarded as a "generous employer", often continuing to pay his operators and allowing their families to live in his clubhouses even while his clubs were shut down by police raids. He also donated large portions of his income to charities in his later years. He was in ill health for two years prior to his death. Daly's wife died in 1905, and Daly died at his East Fifty-Fourth Street home on the evening of April 26, 1906.

MrsP.com

MrsP.com is a free children's entertainment website. It stars actress Kathy Kinney as Mrs. P, a redheaded Irishwoman who reads classic children's stories from her "Magic Library." The target audience for the website is kids between the ages of 3-12, and its goal is to "encourage a lifetime love of reading." It has no advertising and no subscription fees. The site is produced by Mrs P Enterprises, LLC and was created by Kinney, who played Mimi on "The Drew Carey Show", TV writer and producer Clay Graham, and former entertainment and New Media executive Dana Plautz.
Content.
The primary content offered on MrsP.com is a library of streaming video episodes. The episodes range in length from 5–30 minutes and feature the Mrs. P character seated near a fire in her "Magic Library." She offers a short, often humorous introduction, usually based on one of her youthful adventures and related in some way to the story she is about to read. She then reads the story directly to the camera. The videos include illustrations or photographs, but focus primarily on the emotive performances of the storyteller "in the hope that viewers will use their imaginations." 
Stories read by Mrs. P on the website include "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Little Red Riding Hood", "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" and "Sleeping Beauty". New stories are added every few weeks.
The site also features an animated game in which a stuffed dog, Spyri, comes to life, as well as a "window" in which various visitors appear, including actor Robert Blanche ("World Trade Center", "Ghost Whisperer") as a singing policeman trying to woo Mrs. P.
History.
Development of MrsP.com began in April 2007, when Clay Graham, who had been the head writer and an executive producer of "The Drew Carey Show", first had the idea of creating a "storytelling" website. Dana Plautz, who had been a marketing executive at Hanna-Barbera, joined soon after as a partner and co-president, and they approached Kathy Kinney, who was their "first -- and only -- choice" to play Mrs. P. Kinney also is co-president and co-creator of the website.
The site launched at midnight on November 10, 2008. Its production offices are in Portland, Oregon and Los Angeles. Powell's Books, the world's largest independent bookstore, supports the site with a "Mrs. P Aisle" on it website, www.powells.com, and with other promotional activities.
Mrs. P made her first national TV appearance on Dec. 6, 2008 in a live broadcast from the Manhattan FAO Schwarz Toy Store for the CBS "Early Show". She recommended her favorite children's books for the holiday season and read "The Princess and the Pea" to an audience of children.
On December 9, 2008, MrsP.com began offering videos from its library for purchase and download on the iTunes Store. Ten percent of all MrsP.com's after-tax profits will be donated by Mrs P Enterprises, LLC to literacy organizations.
Mrs. P made an appearance at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, the nation's largest book fair, on April 25, 2009. She read to a crowd of several hundred children and parents from the Target-sponsored Children's Stage.
On April 27, 2009, MrsP.com won the National Parenting Center Seal of Approval. In its review, the Center called the website "beautifully conceived" and "beautifully rendered," adding that "the site felt extremely genuine in its desire to help children develop a love of reading and did so by creating a fun environment for them" in which to be read to.
TeachersFirst.com, a website resource "by teacher, for teachers" reviewed MrsP.com in May, 2009, stating "You almost want to toast marshmallows on the open fire as you cyber-curl under Mrs. P's feet by the fireplace." The teacher's website also said MrsP.com "will thrill your eager readers for hours" - although warning "do not even try this one on a slow connection." 
On May 27, 2009, MrsP.com was chosen by the American Library Association as one of its "Great Web Sites for Kids."

Zhuoying Spring

The Zhuoying Spring (, literally "washing out the tassel spring") is a culturally significant artesian karst spring located in historical center of the city of Jinan, Shandong Province, China. It is listed among the 72 famous springs 
() of Jinan (as number 19.). The spring forms a large spring pool, the "Palace Pool" (), that is used as a public outdoor swimming pool. 
The name "Zhuoying Spring" comes from a poem from Mencius, "Li Lou Shang" (), that contains the phrase "wash out the tassel" (). 
When the army of the Jin Dynasty invaded Jinan moving southward into the territory of the Southern Song Dynasty, the local garrison commander, Guan Sheng (), refused to surrender. A bloody battle ensued and the soldiers washed the textile decorations of their lancets in the Palace Pool. 
The name "Palace Pool" dates back to the time of the Ming Dynasty, when the De Wang Palace () was constructed at the site and the spring pool was included into its grounds. Today, the pool lies in a historical residential neighborhood with private residences on the water edge.

Annerly

Annerly was a sternwheel steamboat that operated on the upper Kootenay River in British Columbia and northwestern Montana from 1892 to 1896.
Design and Construction.
"Annerly" was built in 1892 at Jennings, Montana on the Kootenay River for the partnership of Dupuy & Jones. "Annerly" was a small steam vessel with scant accommodations.
Operations on Kootenay River.
"Annerly" was the first American steamer to run on the upper Kootenay river. "Annerly" first arrived at Fort Steele, BC, then the principal settlement in the region, in May, 1993.
During the navigation seasons (generally fall and spring) of 1893 through 1895, "Annerly" was operated from Jennings, Montana north up the Kootenay River across the international border into British Columbia to a point on the river known as North Star Landing, upriver from Fort Steele. "Annerly" loaded ore at North Star landing and then transported the ore south to Jennings to connect with the Great Northern Railway. Annerly's commanders included Capt. James D. Miller (1830–1914) and Capt. Irvin B. Sandborn.
Rescue mission in Jennings Canyon.
Operations on the Kootenay river were made hazardous by the Jennings Canyon. Of the six sternwheelers that were employed on the upper Kootenay River, only "Annerly" was not wrecked or seriously damaged in the canyon. Steamers sometimes ran in pairs through the canyon. On July 12, 1896, "Annerly" under Captain Sandborn, was running Jennings Canyon ahead of "Rustler". "Rustler" hit a rock which made a hole in the hull near the boiler. Fortunately Captain Sandborn's wife noticed something wrong with "Rustler" and called out to her husband. Sandborn then turned "Annerly" around and went back up the canyon. He arrived in time to take off all 19 of "Rustler"'s passengers and crew just before "Rustler" was washed off the rock and rolled over.
Dismantled.
"Annerly" was dismantled in 1896.

She is one of about 40 high school students who signed the 2008 high-school seniors’ ("Shministim") protest letter. In order to prepare herself for her incarceration in a military prison, Goldman went to a psychologist every week. She has spent a second term in prison for refusing to serve again.
She notes that the crucial moment of her political awakening occurred when she went to the Palestinian village Shufa where the IDF had set up a roadblock and fired rubber bullets on a Palestinian demonstration. Someone she had considered her enemy stood beside her and someone who was supposed to be defending her opened fire at her.

Nowitka (sternwheeler)

Nowitka was a sternwheel steamboat that operated in British Columbia on the Columbia River from 1911 to May 1920. The name is a Chinook Jargon word usually translated as "Indeed!" or "Verily!".
Design and construction.
"Nowitka" was built at Golden, BC for the Golden Columbia River Lumber Company. "Nowitka"'s engines were over 70 years old, and had been originally built for a ferry crossing the St. Lawrence River. The engines had been previously installed in other sternwheelers on the upper Columbia River, including the first "Duchess", the second "Duchess" and "Ptarmigan". The blunt-ended bow of "Nowitka" allowed the vessel to be readily capable of pushing barges, which increased the vessel's utility and effective cargo capacity.
Operations.
"Nowitka" was placed on the Columbia River route that began at Golden and ran south, at least during high water, to Columbia Lake, the ultimate source of the Columbia River. "Nowitka" was last used to haul supplies to construct a bridge at Brisco, BC. 
Removal from service.
Following construction of the bridge at Brisco, "Nowitka" was taken out of service in May 1920, and abandoned near the sawmill wharf at Golden. "Nowitka" was the last steamboat to operate on the Columbia River in the Columbia Valley, although gasoline and diesel powered vessels did run later on the river.

Short Cut Draw Blood

Short Cut Draw Blood is the third studio album by the British musician Jim Capaldi. Released by Island Records in 1975, it marked a major turning point in Capaldi's career: It was his first album recorded after the breakup of Traffic, and more importantly, it was his commercial breakthrough. While Capaldi's first two solo albums had been moderately successful in the USA (and in fact, in the USA "Short Cut Draw Blood" was his least successful album thus far, with both the album itself and the single "Love Hurts" barely scraping into the Billboard charts), "Short Cut Draw Blood" saw him entering the charts in several other countries for the first time. This was particularly evident in his native United Kingdom; the single "It's All Up to You", released a year before the album, became his first top 40 hit there, only to be overshadowed the following year by his cover of "Love Hurts", which went all the way to number 4.
The album's name was conceived by co-producer Chris Blackwell.
Background.
The song "Boy with a Problem" was written about former Traffic bandmate Chris Wood, whose self-destructive tendencies (particularly his drug addiction) were a cause of increasing concern for Capaldi.
Reception.
"Rolling Stone" called the album slightly uneven but a promising step forward. Their review approved of both the session musicians and the arrangements, and was particularly complimentary towards his cover of "Love Hurts", saying "he brings a sense of pain very different from Roy Orbison's original."
Allmusic's retrospective review was more satisfied with the variety of styles, commenting "dipping into a wide range of musical styles, there is something for everyone on "Short Cut Draw Blood"", and saying the album is even better than his first.
Track listing.
All tracks composed by Jim Capaldi, except where indicated.
One further track from the sessions, "Sugar Honey", was released as a b-side. Aside from Jim Capaldi on vocals, the performing personnel on the track are not known.
2012 Reissue.
In March 2012 Raven an Australian label reissued "Short Cut Draw Blood" along with "The Contender" as a 2 for 1 CD release with 8 bonus tracks, all of them previously released recordings: "Tricky Dicky Rides Again", "Sugar Honey", "If You Think You Know How To Love Me", "Good Night & Good Morning", "Talkin' Bout My Baby", "Still Talkin'", "Goodbye My Love", "Baby You're Not My Problem". The second disc included all the tracks from both the UK "The Contender" and its USA counterpart "Daughter of the Night". The reissue was remastered by Warren Barnett and featured a booklet that discussed the making of both albums.

Yellowstone Club

The Yellowstone Club, also Yellowstone Ski Resort, is a residential club, ski resort, and golf resort located in the state of Montana, USA. The Rocky Mountain ski and golf club is located in eastern Madison County, just west of Big Sky, Montana, south of Bozeman and northwest of Yellowstone National Park. The club entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2008 and emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009. It is owned by investors led by CrossHarbor Capital Partners, and is operated by Discovery Land Company.
History.
During its peak season, almost 600 people are employed at the club.
The club was featured on CNBC's lifestyle show "High Net Worth" with Tyler Mathisen.
Cyclist Greg LeMond, an early investor and homeowner/member, sued the club in 2006, saying club founder Tim Blixseth and his former wife Edra Denise (Crocker) Blixseth had borrowed $375 million from Credit Suisse Group and took $209 million for themselves as a dividend, jilting him and other investors. The suit was settled in 2008 for $39.5 million. Ms. Blixseth eventually agreed to pay Mr. LeMond and others a $21.5 million settlement; she’s paid only $8 million of that amount and Mr. LeMond and others are now among her creditors in her personal bankruptcy.
Other members identified in, or cited in, the "Times" report were Burt Sugarman, a Beverly Hills businessman, and his wife, the "Entertainment Tonight" host Mary Hart; Steve Burke, the chief operating officer of Comcast; Bill Frist, the former Senate majority leader; Todd Thomson, the former head of Citigroup’s private banking unit; Robert Greenhill, founder of the investment bank Greenhill & Company; Annika Sörenstam, the Swedish golf star; Frank McCourt, the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers; Jim Davidson, a founder of Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm in Menlo Park (CA); Brian Klein, a former Goldman Sachs vice president who now runs an investment management firm in Seattle; Peter Chernin of the News Corporation; Barry Sternlicht, the hotelier and CEO of Starwood Capital Group; and Gary Rieschel, a venture capitalist with Qiming Venture Partners. Jack Kemp, the late U.S. politician, was on the club’s honorary board of directors with Mr. Quayle, among others.
The "Times" said that as of June 2009, Yellowstone Club had about 250 members. It said membership cost a minimum of $250,000 to join, plus the cost of a $5 million to $35 million mountainside home, plus annual dues of about $20,000, according to members.
2008-2009 Bankruptcy protection.
On November 10, 2008, in the midst of the economic downturn, the Yellowstone Club filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It emerged from protection under new ownership on July 19, 2009. When filing, the Club's prior owners owed US$343 million to creditors, such as banks and local contractors.
In June 2009 Edra Blixseth spoke to a reporter for "The New York Times" about her and her ex-husband's business affairs from Porcupine Creek, her estate in Rancho Mirage, CA. She said she had hoped to retain the Club and her various estates and make Porcupine Creek income-producing with its private golf course. However, Porcupine Creek was sold to Larry Ellison in 2011 for $42.9 million by creditors who also sold the Blixseth's Chateau de Farcheville in France and other assets.
As part of the bankruptcy resolution, the Yellowstone Club was sold for $115 million to a private equity firm, CrossHarbor Capital Partners affiliated with a Yellowstone Club member, Sam Byrne. Prior to the bankruptcy and disclosure of the Credit Suisse-Blixseth loan details, negotiations with that same buyer had put a $400 million price tag on the club. In the 2009 bankruptcy transaction, Byrne also "invested $75 million above the purchase price in repairs and set aside an additional $15 million to pay the club’s creditors," according to the "Times". The deal was brokered by Jeff Woolson, Managing Director of the CBRE Golf & Resort Properties Group, and Steve Lehr, Managing Director of CBRE's Land Services Group. CB Richard Ellis was selected by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to market the property because of the firm's successful track record handling complicated transactions.
In November 2010 some parts of the bankruptcy reorganization were appealed by former owner Tim Blixseth, particularly those concerning the settlement with Credit Suisse and aspects of the bankruptcy allowing creditors to pursue Blixseth for "hundreds of millions" they claim he siphoned from the Club for his personal use. In 2012 Blixseth's appeals were dismissed by the U.S. Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit.
Location and Ski Mountain.
Most of the ski runs are on Pioneer Mountain (). Pioneer Mountain has a summit elevation of .
The resort itself has several lifts and ski runs that tie it directly into Big Sky Resort's lift system. The Big Sky ski area and the Yellowstone Club share a five mile border.
Snowfall averages approximately 300 inches a year and is very consistent from year to year and week to week. Although one of the few western ski resorts located east of the continental divide, the area receives consistent light snows. The club's tagline is "Private Powder" and this is made possible by frequent snows and low skier traffic.
The ski terrain is extensive and varied and compares favorably with other well known ski resorts. Pioneer Ridge has numerous "double black" expert runs and challenging chutes. The west side of Pioneer Mountain is a vast forest for tree skiing. Lower Pioneer Mountain and Andesite Mountain are dotted with high speed chairlifts and mainly intermediate ski runs. The mountain has 2200 acres for skiing.
The club also features cross country skiing, ice skating and numerous indoor activities. Many additional recreational opportunities are available in summer including golf, climbing, mountain biking, kayaking, and fly fishing.

The Red Sense

The Red Sense ("Vignean Krohom" ) is a 2006 Khmer-Australian supernatural thriller film. It was director Tim Pek's debut film and was produced by Transparent Pictures. The success of The Red Sense led Transparent Pictures to produce films such as Bokator and Annoyed. The Red Sense was first released in Australia in August 2008, and though banned for general release there, screened in Cambodia in December that year. It is rated M (Recommended for mature audiences) by the Office of Film and Literature Classification of Australia.
Plot.
The film is a mystery story set in Cambodia in the Khmer Rouge era.
Production.
In 2004 Khmer graphic designer Tim Pek took a small role for a short film called Chhay. The film was about two brothers and focused on the pre- and post-Khmer Rouge era. Exposed for the first time to how films were produced, Tim started to contemplate various ways to improve the concepts of film making.
A few months later, Tim received a Cambodian Fashion Show video from Adelaide with an extra feature of a five minutes short film, directed by Chhai Thach. This film, entitled ‘Bugger!’, was made in New Zealand and had won the best short film award. Impressed with the simple story, Tim got in contact with Chhai and discussed the making of a new short film as a team. A month later, Chhai came up with another mystery story, also set during the Khmer Rouge era. After some discussion, both Tim and Chhai agreed to make three parts of the story. Tim managed to produce a script within a few weeks for a 15-minute short film intended for entry into film festivals.
The film project was created in early 2005 and became ‘The Red Sense’, or ‘Vignean Krohom’ in Khmer. Pek said of the film: ”I had the opportunity to work with various non-actors which I thought would be a terrific opportunity as a director. The casts and crews are very supportive, which continues to keep my spirit high”.
Release.
Premier.
Audiences were given a preview of the film in Adelaide, Australia. Its official release, however, was in Melbourne on August 3, 2008, with special guest Mr Yuhorn Chea, the former mayor of the City of Greater Dandenong. There were also interviews with several media outlets.
The film was banned for release in Cambodia as the Cambodian Government does not allow films pertaining to the Khmer Rouge. This has become an issue among the film's fans: "" I really want to watch the Red Sense. I have heard of it for a long time, and I have watched the trailer. It seems interesting. Some people told me that it’s not the same as other Khmer Rouge movies, filmed in the past.""said a Khmer monk now living abroad, while a foreigner working in the Khmer film industry said, ""It’s a shame that Tim can’t get the film screened over here, but then this is the country where the Khmer Rouge period has been erased from school text books."" 
Despite its being banned, the film was screened in Siem Reap during the second Cambofest.
Reception.
In Angkorian Society, Hemara In said, ""Tim Pek's film is very promising. He has been through the Pol Pot, Khmer Rouge and understands how this effect him, very proud of Tim Pek and a great Cambodian community here will support him and would like to wish Tim Pek a great future"" (sic) while two critics of Anonymous, Chris & Margot, stated that ""The emotionals were there and come from the heart. It deserves all the praise that it gets"" Says Chris."" The Khmer Rouge result was some consequences and I congratulate Tim Pek on The Red Sense"." Says Margot. Clayton MP, Mr. Hong Lim also described the film to positive reviews. He said: ""The way he approaches the film is very opportunistic, the way that Tim portrays comes straight from the human heart. These story brings out the Khmer Rouge quite well, the way he put in with the past and present. All Cambodian communities should be very proud of this film"".
In the Adelaide premier, the film also received A reviews. A film critic, Paul Millson, said: ""Many people were very happy that Tim made a film for the thousands of family members that want this story to be told and shown all around the world for all to see"".
Awards and nominations.
As well as these reviews, the film received awards at CamboFest film and video festival in Siem Reap, Cambodia. It was named the Golden Buffalo winner as the best local film.

Duck River (New South Wales)

Duck River is a perennial stream and southern tributary of the Parramatta River, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
History.
The Darug people of the Burramattagal clan were the original inhabitants of the land at the head of the Parramatta River. The southern riverbank was a vital source of their food and living resources. In their seasonal rotation of campsites around their territory, the clan would have found that the abundant fish, shellfish, birds, reptiles and marsupials contributed greatly to their daily quest for food. The agreed boundary between the Burramattagal country and their neighbours, the Wategora clan, is believed to have been the Duck River.
On 22 April 1788 Governor Arthur Phillip and his party of officers and marines journeyed inland by boat from Sydney Cove to find better farmlands for the new settlement. At the head of the navigable river they landed on the shore near Clyde of what he named "Duck River" due to the abundance of ducks in the area. They left their boats to explore the area but could not penetrate the thick bush.
In the early 1800s John Macarthur extended his land grants and his Elizabeth Farm holdings to gain the complete river frontage between the township of Parramatta and Duck River.
Early surveys and maps suggest the Duck River area downstream from the confluence with A'Becketts Creek was a wetland of saltmarsh, rushes and grasses. Upstream, the Eucalypt forest adjoining Duck River was cleared by the Australian Timber Company to supply railway sleepers and firewood during and after the construction of the Sydney to Parramatta railway in the 1850s.
In 1898 Clyde Engineering was built nearby to the river. In 1908 the Fells Oil Refinery, and in 1928 the Clyde Refinery was built on left hand bank where Duck River joins the Parramatta River.
Geography.
Duck River flows in a generally north then east-north-east direction for about from where it rises from a drain in the suburb of Birrong to where it joins the Parramatta River at Silverwater. In its lower reaches it is a tidal creek.
The Duck River Catchment commences in the Bankstown local government area, near Bankstown and Condell Park. The area drains north through a system of stormwater pipes and open drains to the Sydney Water Supply Pipeline at Sefton, which is the boundary between Bankstown City and Parramatta City. From here, a more natural watercourse continues through the Parramatta and Auburn local government areas to eventually join the Parramatta River.
Downstream, A'Becketts Creek flows into Duck River at Rosehill, near the M4 Western Motorway overpass of James Ruse Drive and the Rosehill Heliport/Airport.
Wellington Road Reserve.
An important bushland area is situated on the Duck River, 5 km south of the Parramatta River, opposite Auburn Golf Course. 246 indigenous species of plants are recorded at the Wellington Road Reserve. A remnant of the Cumberland Plain Woodland, the 11 hectare area canopy consists of eucalyptus woodland, dominated by Grey Box and Broad-leaved Ironbark. Three species of Tea Trees (Melaleuca) are also common. However, other unusual plants known from wetter areas include Turpentine, Cheese Tree, Red Mahogany and Coffee Bush. Grey Gum grow near an outcrop of Minchinbury Sandstone. Wildflowers are common in late winter, and small orchids may be observed. Being surrounded by suburbia, the reserve is affected by weeds. Bush regeneration programs are in place. Native wildlife includes possums, many species of birds, and reptiles such as the Water Skink and Red-bellied black snake. Budgerigars and Brush Turkeys have been recorded in the reserve.

Isabella McCormack

Isabella McCormack (sometimes known as "Isabel", "Isabell" or "Isabelle") was a sternwheel steamboat that operated in British Columbia on the Columbia River from 1908 to 1910. This vessel should not be confused with others with similar names.
Design and Construction.
"Isabella McCormack" was built at Golden, BC by Alexander Blakely for the Columbia River Lumber Company, and was intended to be a replacement for "Ptarmigan".
Operations.
"Isabelle McCormack" was placed on the Columbia River route that began at Golden and ran south, at least during high water, to Columbia Lake, the ultimate source of the Columbia River. While the vessel was the fastest steamboat on the route, she was not a success.
Conversion to houseboat.
In 1910 "Isabella McCormack" was converted into a floating houseboat and hotel. Her engines were removed and installed in a new sternwheeler, 'Klahowya". The vessel remained in houseboat use until 1914.

Flekkefjord Line

The Flekkefjord Line () is a abandoned branch line to the Sørland Line. It ran between Sira and Flekkefjord in Vest-Agder, Norway. The only current activity on the line is tourist draisines. The station buildings along the line were designed by the architect Paul Armin Due—these have all been demolished.
The line opened in 1904 as a extension of the narrow gauge Jæren Line. It was planned as the first step of a main line along the South Coast. At Flekkefjord, there was steam ship connection, onwards to Oslo. In 1941, the line was converted to standard gauge, and in 1944 the Sørland Line was completed. The western part of the Flekkefjord Line was integrated into it, while the remaining section became the branch line that kept the name "Flekkefjord Line". During the 1940s, steam locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by railcars. Following the declining traffic, in part due to the slow speeds caused by the line's narrow profile, the line was closed, with the last trains running in 1990.
History.
Construction.
The first committee that looked into the possibility of a railway to Flekkefjord was created in 1875. After the completion of Jæren Line from Stavanger to Egersund, in 1878, proposals were made to build an extension westwards along the coast, that eventually would reach Oslo. The first part of what was named the Vestland Line was passed by Parliament in 1894, and would run from Egersund, via Sira, to Flekkefjord. The initial proposal proposed that the line would eventually continue onwards via Mandal to Kristiansand. The decision to build the line was taken by the Parliament of Norway in 1894. Construction started in 1896, and was originally planned to be completed by 1902. However, delays prevented the line from being be brought into use before 1 November 1904. The line was built by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and was long.
The coast between Egersund and Flekkefjord would give a very difficult route to build, so it was decided to build a more inland line. Like the Jæren Line, and most railways being built at the time, the Flekkefjord Line was built in narrow gauge (). Both telephone and telegraph cables were laid along the line. Along the section from Sirnes to Flekkefjord, there were many vertical cliffs straight into the fjord, forcing , or 38 percent, of the line to be built in tunnels. Of the whole length from Egersund to Flekkefjord, there are 46 tunnels, totaling . The most prominent was Ravnejuret Tunnel which is long. Just before Flekkefjord, a bridge was built that crosses Selurelva; it was a reused bridge from the Voss Line. In total, about 12% of the line consisted of tunnels. Francis Hagerup, when delivering the line's opening speech, remarked that no other railway had until then been more difficult to construct.
All the stations along the line were designed by Paul Armin Due, with all but the terminal station built in wood. Flekkefjord Station was built as a three-story brick building in Art Nouveau. In addition, there was construction a depot and a wharf at Flekkefjord. Passengers could transfer to steam ship services that operated eastwards along the south coast towards Oslo.
Pre-war operations.
The first part of the line to open for temporary operation was between Flekkefjord and Moi on 1 October 1904. For the official opening, the town of Flekkefjord was adorned with Norwegian flags. A train departed to Egersund on 31 October 1904 with several notable passengers: Prime Minister Francis Hagerup, State Railways director Elias Sunde and board member Sven Aarrestad, director of traffic Jens Christian Mellbye, Flekkefjord's mayor and city council as well as other mayors of the district. Festivities continued on the next day, when the train returned from Egersund to Flekkefjord.
Initially there were four services in each direction each day, with three services on holy days. The train that connected with the steam ship would wait up to 45 minutes in case of delays, to allow connection. Until 1927, the routes remained the same. That year, the Kragerø Line opened, and it became possible to take a night train from Oslo to Kragerø, continue by bus to Flekkefjord, and be in Stavanger the following afternoon. Travel time was further reduced when the Sørland Line was extended to Arendal in 1935. The initial rolling stock was from the Voss Line, and some of the bridges and track was from that line too. The Voss Line was being upgraded to rail tracks, and of track was used on the Flekkefjord Line.
Until 1927, all trains were operated with steam locomotives. NSB introduced the first diesel multiple unit with the introduction of "lightning trains" that corresponded with coach services that connected with the Kragerø Line. The first were Class 14 railcars. These reduced travel time from Flekkefjord to Stavanger by 50 minutes to 3 hours 15 minutes. In addition to passengers, major cargo were herring and lumber.
Connecting the coast.
In 1923, it was decided by parliament that the Sørland Line, that would connect Oslo, Kristiansand and Stavanger, would follow an inner route. The section of the Flekkefjord Line from Egersund to Sira would become part of that line, while the eastern from Sira to Flekkefjord would become a branch line, retaining the Flekkefjord Line name. Since the Sørland Line needed to be built from the east, construction along the Flekkefjord Line did not start until 1940. After the German occupation of Norway during World War II, the German occupation forces were rebuilding the narrow gauge railways to standard gauge. In 1940–41, the Flekkefjord and Jæren Lines were rebuilt to dual gauge. Not until 1944 was the Flekkefjord Line only standard gauge.
Due to limited funds, and unlike the rest of the Jæren Line, the profile of the Flekkefjord Line was not changed during the conversion of gauge. This gave a speed limit of , and creative solutions such as lowering height of the ballast by . The route from Egersund to Sira received a better upgrade, since it was to become part of the main line through Southern Norway. The route between Sira and Sirnes was completely rebuilt. This gave severe limits to the use of the section between Flekkefjord and Sirnes; most classes of trains could not run on the line, as were freight trains.
Post-war operations.
After the line had been relegated to a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, which did not exist in Flekkefjord until 1918, but thereafter became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.
Closing.
The line had major limitations on speed, and also served the "wrong direction", heading westwards into less populated areas instead of the populated parts of Agder in the east. Major investments would be needed to upgrade the line to a suitable speed, and through the 1970s this became an important issue of debate. On the other hand, the line had among the highest ridership of the branch lines, with 120,000 passengers per year, which was for instance 50% higher than the Arendal Line, which was not closed. However, parliament decided to close the line, along with several other branch lines, in 1988, with effect from 1990. The last scheduled train ran on 31 December 1990.
There were plans to establish private operations along the line. Continental Railway Systems was established by Rasmus Surdal. The company would be allowed to use the rolling stock and infrastructure, and two of the trains were painted white. However, it was not possible for the company to get the necessary bank surety demanded by NSB, and nothing came of the plans.
The line has been suggested preserved as a cultural heritage, since it represents one of very few railways with the original narrow gauge profile intact. However, all stations have been demolished; Flekkefjord in 1970, Sirnes in 1977 and Flikkeid in 1988. The organization Friends of the Flekkefjord Line offer rental of draisines for tourists since the closure of the line, and a round trip from Flekkefjord to Bakkekleivi just outside Sira takes about three hours. However, the Norwegian National Rail Administration have since banned the operation of draisines until the line is fully fenced in.

The Cypro-Minoan language is the unknown language recorded in the Cypro-Minoan syllabary. As this script is undeciphered, nothing can be said about the language. It is unknown whether it is related to the Minoan language or not. (There are numerous examples of unrelated languages written in related scripts. Ancient examples include Sumerian vs. Akkadian, and Phoenician vs. Greek; for modern examples, see the many non-Indo-European languages written in the Latin alphabet.)

The command was replaced by the Canadian Joint Operations Command in October 2012. As a separate command, CANOSCOM provided the CF with combat support (including logistics, military engineering, land equipment maintenance services, communications and information systems, health services and military police) and service for both domestic and international missions.
Composition.
CANOSCOM consisted of approximately 1,100 soldiers from all branches of the Canadian Forces who provide operations support to thousands of Canadian Forces involved in many missions. CANOSCOM commanded the Canadian Forces Joint Support Group, the Canadian Forces Joint Signal Regiment and Canadian Materiel Support Group. CANOSCOM had oversight over 16 units and formations. These included the:

Salta (game)

Salta is two-player abstract strategy board game invented by Konrad Heinrich Büttgenbach in 1899 in Germany. Büttgenbach (1870–1939) was born in Heerdt, near Düsseldorf, Germany. The game attained its highest popularity in the early 1900s before World War I especially in France and Germany. The World Trade Fair of 1900 in Paris exhibited a Salta board made of mahogany with golden counters adorned with more than 5,000 diamonds. Famous players were the US chess master Frank Marshall, the German World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker, and the French actress Sarah Bernhardt (the "Divine").
Salta means "jump" in Italian or Latin. The game is related to Halma, Chinese Checkers, and Conspirateurs. Players attempt to jump over pieces without capturing them, and be first to advance their pieces to the other player's side. Salta is played on a Continental Checker board with 10x10 chequered squares. One player has green markings on white pieces, and the other player has red markings on black pieces. 
Salta should not be confused with El Asalto or The Assault or Salto which is a member of the Fox games. 
Goal.
The player that can first bring each of their pieces seven rows forward is the winner. The pieces must retain their original order in each row. 
Equipment.
A 10x10 chequered square board is used as in a Continental Checker board. Each player has 15 pieces that are initially lined up on the dark squares of the first three ranks of each player's side. The five pieces on the first rank are called stars, and are marked with one to five stars in ascending order from left to right. The five pieces on the second rank are called moons, and are marked with one to five moons in ascending order from left to right. The five pieces on the third rank are called suns, and are marked with one to five suns in ascending order from left to right. An alternative marking system is to simply number the stars 1 to 5 from left to right, number the moons 6 to 10 from left to right, and number the suns 11 to 15 from left to right. One player has the white pieces with the green markings, and the other player has the black pieces with the red markings. Pieces are only played on the black squares.

Hydrogenography

Hydrogenography is a combinatorial method based on the observation of optical changes on the metal surface by hydrogen absorption. The method allows the examination of thousands of combinations of alloy samples in a single batch.
History.
In the 1996 report of the method, thin films were coated with yttrium and lanthanum topped with a layer of palladium for the diffusion of hydrogen. The rate of absorption of hydrogen resulted in typical optical properties. In the 2008 report magnesium, titanium and nickel are eroded and sputtering deposited in different ratios onto a transparent film in a thin layer of 100 nanometres following exposure to hydrogen in different amounts resulting in optical differences,

Alain Akouala Atipault

Alain Akouala Atipault (born 1959) is a Congolese politician. He served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Communication from 2002 to 2009, and he has been Minister of Special Economic Zones since 2009.
Political career.
Akouala Atipault was born in Brazzaville. In 1995, he became a communications adviser to the Committee for the Privatization of State Enterprises; he also served for a time as communications adviser to the National Oil Company of Congo ("Société Nationale des Pétroles du Congo", SNPC). At the time of the March 2002 presidential election, he worked as spokesman for President Denis Sassou Nguesso's campaign. In the absence of any serious competitors, Sassou Nguesso's victory was viewed as a foregone conclusion. As campaign spokesman, Akouala Atipault argued that the election was fair, although he acknowledged that there were some "minor problems" in the process. After the election, Akouala Atipault was appointed to the government as Minister of Communication and Relations with Parliament, as well as Government Spokesman, on 18 August 2002. He was derisively dubbed "the minister of denial" by opposition media.
In response to "misconceptions" in "The Washington Times", Akouala Atipault wrote a commentary piece for that paper that was published on 11 June 2006. He defended President Sassou Nguesso and the government's policies, arguing that Congo-Brazzaville was heavily burdened by debt and badly needed debt relief.
Akouala Atipault is the National President of Citizen Force, a political association, as of 2007. In the June–August 2007 parliamentary election, he stood as a candidate in Gamboma II constituency, but he was defeated by Guy Timothée Ngantsio Gambou. He appealed to the Constitutional Court, but his appeal was rejected.
During the campaign for the 12 July 2009 presidential election, Akouala Atipault worked on Sassou Nguesso's campaign as head of the foreign relations department. In the election, Sassou Nguesso faced an anemic field of competitors, thinned by boycotts and disqualifications. Akouala Atipault dismissed the opposition's claims of fraud as "incorrect" and claimed that the presence of 170 international observers disproved the accusations of fraud. According to Akouala Atipault, the opposition's claim that voter turnout was only 10% was "ludicrous".
Following Sassou Nguesso's victory, Akouala Atipault was moved to the post of Minister at the Presidency for Special Economic Zones as part of a cabinet reshuffle on 15 September 2009.
When scandal erupted in October 2009 over a book foreword supposedly written by Nelson Mandela for a collection of interviews with Sassou Nguesso, with Mandela's foundation claiming he had neither read the book in question nor authorised his name to be associated with it, Akouala Atipault again came to the Congolese president's defense. Arguing that the Congolese people needed nobody's permission to use Mandela's name, he told an interviewer that "Mandela doesn't even belong to himself. He belongs to us." Akouala Atipault went on to urge legal action against the Nelson Mandela Foundation, which he described as "an organization that, in reality, has nothing to do with the personality of Nelson Mandela," and condemned it as a commercial concern linked with "savage capitalism and international finance."
As Minister for Special Economic Zones, Akouala Atipault was responsible for the implementation of four special economic zones at Ouesso, Oyo–Ollombo, Brazzaville, and Pointe-Noire. He visited Mauritius for a week in late 2013, and in a subsequent interview he discussed the importance of developing a partnership between the two countries and learning from the economic experience of Mauritius. He also discussed the need to diversify Congo-Brazzaville's economy beyond its reliance on oil through the development of the special economic zones.

Walker Iron Foundry

The Walker Iron Foundry was founded in 1837 by John Walker of York (1801–23 June 1853) 'Iron & brass founder, bell-hanger & smith', at Dixon's Yard, Walmgate.
The son of William and Elizabeth Walker, of the Aldwark-Hungate area, John Walker began a 7-year bound apprenticeship to Thomas & Joseph Gibson, Ironmongers of Pavement, York on 25 March 1815. Thomas died, and after completing his indentures, Walker stayed with the firm. In 1824 he became a Freeman of York and by 1829 he had become Gibson's partner. He must have been a very industrious young man, since by November 1837 he had bought out the Gibson foundry at 33 Walmgate and set up his own business.
In 1827 Walker married Jane Thomlinson of Whenby. The foundry site () on the banks of the River Foss, which facilitated water-borne transport, was originally silty land that had been reclaimed by a medieval dam and was a notoriously unsanitary slum. Five of the Walkers' 7 children died, perhaps partly because of the unhealthy conditions, only 1 surviving beyond his 23rd year. Walker stood unsuccessfully as Conservative candidate for his local ward, but became a City Commissioner and a Churchwarden of St Denys Church, Walmgate. He 'for many years paid the expenses of instructing the men in his employment in singing, and by this means raised an efficient church choir'. Gazette 2 July 1853
Beginning locally, supplying the first gas lamps and railings for St Leonards Place, the firm prospered and in 1845–6 supplied the gates to Kew Gardens, London. This commission earned Walker the patronage of Queen Victoria in 1847 and he was granted permission to add ""Ironfounders & Purveyors of Smithy Work to the Queen"" to his letterheading. In 1850–53 his firm supplied the gates and railings to the British Museum, London. Photo: The gates were designed by Sydney Smirke and weighed 10 tons, according to the museum's records. They were originally opened by a windlass. Walker's tender of £6,786 contrasted with 2 London foundries' tenders of £7248 and £9050. Considering the additional substantial costs of transport from Yorkshire, it seems likely that Walker astutely took the opportunity to acquire kudos before profit. He also supplied the cast iron standard lamps in the museum forecourt, which were originally gas. According to a British History report [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36360, Walker achieved his success by submitting tenders far below those of his competitors. He supplied many large landowners with gates and railings, including Queen Victoria at Sandringham, Norfolk.
In 1843, following an accidental fire in 1840, Walker's supplied cast iron roof trusses for the South Nave of York Minster, which were erected by the York builder George Coates. Then in 1849 they supplied similar iron trusses for Castle Oliver, Limerick, Ireland to designs by the York architect George Fowler Jones.
By 1851 Walker's employed 52 men and according to the 1871 Census, 57 workmen & 5 boys. Measom's Illustrated Guide to the North Eastern Railway, 1861, says Walker's employed upwards of 100 workmen.
Upon his death in 1853, John was succeeded in what had by then become an extremely healthy business, by his son William (bapt. Whenby July 1828). On 28 April 1855 William married Sarah Thomas of King's Snaith, York and they lived away from the foundry, at Lawrence Street, then Clifton Grove. In the 1870s William adopted his mother's maiden name, becoming William Thomlinson Walker, later hyphenating the names. The firm were then Thomlinson-Walker Ltd, Iron Founders. In 1856 the Dixon's Yard premises were sold for £1,000 and the firm moved to 76 Walmgate, naming the new premises Victoria Foundry ()). The Bill of Sale for Dixon's Yard lists a sizeable Master's House; Smiths' Shops with Chambers; 2 large Warehouses, a large yard, Counting Houses, Stables, Cowshed, Piggeries, Hay & Harness Rooms, in all about 1,639 square yards (1,370 square metres). It seems logical that the new premises were substantially larger, or more favourably positioned. Business continued to improve during the 3rd quarter of the 19th century, and in 1886 Walker-Thomlinson Ltd bought adjacent premises at 78 & 80 Walmgate to develop as showrooms.
Walker's developed a healthy business exporting railings and gates to colonial and foreign governments, including the Botanical Gardens in Mauritius and the Maharajah Holkar of India.
Walkers exhibited at Yorks Agricultural Society Show in 1857 and at the Yorks Fine Art & Industrial Exhibition in 1866. York Castle Museum has a leather-bound edition of 'Design Book No.1 of Ironwork' manufactured by WM. Walker 365/41'.
William became active in local politics, becoming a Justice of the Peace, then in 1874, Sheriff of York. He became in 1854 a member of the Yorkshire Agricultural Society; was a prominent member of the York incorporated Sunday School Committee and also dedicated much time to his church. He apparently had a similar social conscience to his father and famously reduced his employees' working hours by half an hour on weekdays and an hour on Saturday. It isn't known at what hour work started in the mornings, but after the reduction they closed at 5.30 and on Saturday at 4.00. This gesture earned him the thanks of his men, who responded 'testifying to him their gratitude for this unsolicited concession' and allegedly his great astonishment and pleasure when they presented him with an engraved 'handsome silver inkstand, pen and pencil case, gold pen, letter seal and papier mache tray'.
William became a prominent citizen of York and donated an impressive stained glass window to Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York. He is depicted kneeling at the feet of Christ, bearing a scroll.[http://yorkholytrinity.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2459027283_42af60b96d_o.jpg] 
His only son, John Richard Walker (bapt. 10 April 1856 at St Denys, Walmgate) assisted him in the business and upon William's death in 1911, his recently altered Will named his son as beneficiary of the company.
in 1886 John Richard Walker married Mary Louisa Esh. They had 2 sons, in 1887 and 1890 and a daughter, Sarah. The 2nd son died in the First World War and the 1st son, Eddie moved with his sister Sarah to Rhodesia. John Richard Walker does not appear to have been made of the same stuff as his father and grandfather. The firm floundered and John brought in fresh capital in the form of a Mr Birch, with whom he set up a new company at the same premises.
Walker's ceased trading shortly after John's death in 1923 and his widowed 2nd wife, Sarah Margaret Jemima lived thereafter in extreme poverty, in almshouses. The area where Walker's once flourished is now known as Foundry Square Gardens and is currently being redeveloped for residential use, having been an office block in the 1970s.

The Forbidden Fountain of Oz

The Forbidden Fountain of Oz is a 1980 children's novel written by Eloise Jarvis McGraw and her daughter Lauren Lynn Mcgraw (or McGraw Wagner), and illustrated by Dick Martin. As its title indicates, the book is one entry in the long-running series of Oz books written by L. Frank Baum and his many successors.
The authors.
The McGraws, mother and daughter, wrote an earlier Oz book, "Merry Go Round in Oz", published in 1963. In their collaboration, the elder McGraw, a veteran children's book author, did the actual writing; she credited her daughter Lauren with story contributions. In "Forbidden Fountain", the text is prefaced with an address to "Dear Fans of Oz, Young, Old, and In-Between," which calls Lauren Lynn McGraw "Assistant Inventor and Head Trouble-Shooter," while Eloise Jarvis McGraw signs herself as "Chief of Bureau of Extraordinary Communications."
The plot.
A child named Emeralda Ozgood, a native of the Emerald City, prepares a concoction of limeade to celebrate the annual Clover Fair — but she naively uses water from the Forbidden Fountain. She only has one customer before she drops and breaks her pitcher; but that customer is Princess Ozma, who drinks the drink and loses her memory. Wandering off and losing her crown, Ozma falls in with a series of new acquaintances, including the Monarch of the Butterflies (who names her "Poppy" after the flowers in her hair) and a talking hedgebird who advises her. 
Outfitted in boy's clothes and hat, Ozma/Poppy meets a lamb named Lambert, who is ostracized from his Gillikin flock for his unnatural white color. The two stumble into Camouflage Creek, and undergo a bewildering string of transformations into bugs and beasts. Back in their own forms, they are confronted by an inept would-be highwayman named Tobias Bridlecull Jr., who quickly becomes the third member of their rambling trio. He carries a Suggestion Box that volunteers suggestions instead of receiving them — as in "Suggest lunch" and "Suggest oil for Suggestion Box."
Returning home to Pumperdink from the Clover Fair, Kabumpo the Elegant Elephant falls into adventures of his own; he is waylaid by the animated toys of Wyndup Town. The elephant literally dumps into "Poppy" and company among the bubblegum and mucilage geysers (or "gozzers") of Gozzerland National Park. The four travelers combine, for further adventures in Cleanitupia and Pristinia. It is only when Kabumpo sees "Poppy" with her long hair unconfined that he recognizes Ozma; then he needs to win the trust of the suspicious amnesiac and bring her home to the Emerald City. (He fails completely at the winning of trust, and hauls her back bodily.) Eventually, Ozma uses the Magic Belt to restore her memory and return to normal.
Details.
The McGraws, like other Oz authors, have to make choices among the vast and sometimes contradictory details of life in Oz. They choose to give Oz a currency (of "ozzos" and "piozters"); but in the third chapter of "The Emerald City of Oz", Baum specifically states that there is "no such thing as money..." in Oz. (As the Tin Woodman says in the fifteenth chapter of "The Road to Oz", "Money in Oz!...What a queer idea!") Baum, however, was not wholly consistent in this detail (as in others), and the early books in the series do feature Oz currency.
Animals talk in the book; even insects do. Yet animals also eat each other: while transformed into talking dragonflies, "Poppy" and Lambert eat their fill of "what-gnats." Later, a Purple Wolf wants to eat Lambert. This raises the vexing question of death in Oz. 
Some of the book's action is set in a border region between the Gillikin Country and the Winkie Country, which allows a blending of the two regions' characteristic colors, purple and yellow. Lauren McGraw provided the book with a map that situates the Winkie Country in the western quadrant of Oz, as in Baum's original scheme.
Forbidden fountain.
The forbidden fountain of the title is the same created by Baum in his sixth Oz book, "The Emerald City of Oz" — an enchanted fountain that purges the memories of all who drink its Water of Oblivion. In that book, the fountain provides the resolution of the plot conflict, through which the invading hordes of a barbarian army are defeated without violence. The fountain appears in later Oz books by Baum and his followers; it is significant in Baum's "The Magic of Oz", Rachel Cosgrove Payes's "The Wicked Witch of Oz", and Edward Einhorn's "Paradox in Oz".
A rich imaginative heritage lies behind Baum's fountain. There is a "forbidden fountain" in Welsh mythology, though instead of effecting drinkers' memories it expels them from fairyland, where it is located. The idea of forbidden drink is closely related to that of forbidden food, which occurs most famously in the "forbidden fruit" of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Book of Genesis, but in other contexts too.
The idea of water that purges the drinker's memory is also ancient. In Greek mythology it occurs as the river Lethe: the souls of the dead lose their memories of their earthly lives by drinking its water. The same idea can also be found in Eastern and other literatures, as in the "Well of the Waters of Forgetfulness" and other guises. "The 'Drink of Forgetfulness' is found in Greek, Hindu, Norse, and other mythologies." The concept received an eighteenth-century expression in James Ridley's "Tales of the Genii" (1764), and from there made its way into drama and even to the visual arts, in John Martin's "Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion" (1812).
Baum, however, made a noteworthy innovation in giving his Water of Oblivion a moral dimension. In his fantasy universe, those who drink from the Forbidden Fountain not only lose their recollections but become benign, "as innocent as babes." (Though this is irrelevant to Princess Ozma, who was benign to begin with.)

Libellus de exordio

The Libellus de exordio atque procursu istius, hoc est Dunhelmensis, ecclesie (), in short Libellus de exordio, is a historical work of marked literary character composed and compiled in the early 12th-century and traditionally attributed to Symeon of Durham. It relates the history of bishopric and church of Durham and its predecessors at Lindisfarne and Chester-le-Street ("Cunecacestre"). It is sometimes also known as the Historia Dunelmensis ecclesiae (English: "History of the Church of Durham").
Manuscripts.
The following is a list of manuscripts containing the text. Each manuscript has its own history, and contains different interpolations and notes. In brackets is the letter or letters used by Rollason, its latest editor, to refer to the manuscript in shorthand:
Authorship and dating.
According to the "Libellus's" preface, the work was carried out on the orders of the monastic leadership of Durham Priory; probably it was Prior Turgot himself who commissioned it. The latest datable contemporary event mentioned in the core of the text (albeit obliquely) is the opening of the tomb of St Cuthbert for his removal into the new cathedral of Durham, 29 August 1104. Manuscripts "C" and "F" are the earliest witnesses of the text, with "C" and "F" written in the same scriptorium while Turgot was prior of Durham, a position Turgot gave up before 1115 at the latest, but perhaps before 1107. The text can therefore be said to have been completed at some point between 1104 and 1107 x 1115.
The work is traditionally attributed to Symeon of Durham, the precentor of Durham Cathedral. The evidence for this are rubrics in manuscript "Ca" and a rubric in manuscript "H". These date respectively to the late 12th century and to around 1300. Though there is nothing in either "C" or "F", modern scholarship has largely reaffirmed the traditional authorship of the text. David Rollason, the text's most recent editor, sees Symeon's role more as that of a lead author and compiler than sole author.
Published versions.
The text has been published four times:
Twysden's edition was based wholly on "Ca". Bedford uses "C" mainly, though consulted "F" and "Ca" for variant readings and chapter headings. Arnold's edition made use of all the manuscripts except "D", "H" and "V".
Coverage and sources.
The coverage of the "Libellus de exordio" extends from the beginning of Christianity among the English of Northumbria and the foundation of a bishopric at Lindisfarne, to the death of Bishop William of Saint-Calais in 1096. The "Libellus" demonstrates the continuity of Durham's history, and in particular it justifies William of Saint-Calais's expulsion of Durham's clerical community in 1083 in order to replace it with a group of Benedictine monks drawn from Wearmouth and Jarrow. What historical continuity the "Libellus" finds comes from the constant presence of the community's patron, Saint Cuthbert. The miracles worked in Cuthbert's name during the late Anglo-Saxon period were particularly flamboyant, and the "Libellus" contains engaging accounts of some of these, including the miracle of the three waves (when Cuthbert turned a portion of the Irish Sea into blood in order to prevent his followers from taking his relics out of England, see "Libellus" ii.11), the foundation of Durham (when Cuthbert's body, being moved across England on a cart, refused to be moved, signaling his desire to remain at Durham, see "Libellus" iii.1), and several picturesque deaths visited upon the enemies of Cuthbert's devotees.
The work consists of four books:
Many earlier sources have been incorporated into the work, particularly the works of Bede and some now lost Northumbrian sources, including a set of "Northern Annals", a "chronicle" of the monastery of Durham, and what appear to be the oral reminiscences of the clerks who had been dislodged during William of Saint-Calais's reign.
Extensions.
There are two texts which constitute extensions of the Libellus de exordio. Firstly, six manuscripts contain a "summary" text which ends c. 1083, when an Benedictine priory was established at Durham. It is unclear if this was written before or after the "Libellus de exordio". 
Attached to the "Libellus de exordio" in eight manuscripts (all save "F" and "V") is an extension covering the period from the episcopate from Ranulf Flambard (1099—1128) to the installation of William de St Barbe (1143—1152). A variant version of this in "Ca" ends with the episcopate of Hugh le Puiset (1153—1195).

Pyroteuthis is a genus of squid in the family Pyroteuthidae. It is differentiated from the genus "Pterygioteuthis" by size, head shape and behaviour. Species within the genus are separated by the arrangement of tentacular photophores; the shape of the hectocotylus, and the shape of the hectocotylus hooks. With the exception of the Tropical Eastern Pacific, the genus is circumpolar in tropical and temperate oceans. The species "P. addolux" is the only member to occur in the North Pacific.

Geonium atom

A geonium atom is a false "atom" created in a magnetic Penning trap. A Penning trap is a combination of a homogeneous magnetic field and an electrostatic quadrupole potential. A single charged particle can be trapped indefinitely in a Penning trap. A small cloud of charged particles in such a trap is like a many-electron atom, with the difference that the role of the atomic nucleus is played by an adjustable external field in the trap. 
In the simplest case, the system consists of only one electron or only one ion in the trap. Such quantum system is determined by the motion of one particle, like the hydrogen atom, but the properties of the system are indeed very different. Its energy levels and g-factor of the charged particle can be measured and calculated with a very high precision. 
Hans Dehmelt of the University of Washington created the first Geonium atom in 1973, by quasi-permanently trapping an electron. In 1989 he and Wolfgang Paul of Bonn University received the Nobel Prize for Physics for their work on isolating individual electrons and ions and making exact measurements of them.

Project E

Project E was a joint project between the United States and the United Kingdom during the cold war to provide nuclear weapons to the British Royal Air Force (RAF) prior to Britain's own nuclear weapons becoming available. Later sometimes used more widely to refer to similar arrangements for the British Army of the Rhine.
Although Britain sought an independent nuclear deterrent during the 1950s, it only possessed ten atomic weapons in 1955 and 14 in 1956. Project E provided RAF Bomber Command with weapons to compensate. The first record of the project was in 1958 concerning the provision of Mk 7 weapons to be carried by the Canberra bomber.
Later, Mk 5 weapons were provided for the V bomber force. This provision was problematic for the RAF since United States Air Force (USAF) personnel had guardianship of these weapons at all times and they could not be dispersed to dispersal airfields as the RAF desired. As a result the weapons were returned to the United States as soon as possible when British-made nuclear and thermonuclear weapons became available.
In the United Kingdom, Project E came to an end in 1965, while in forces assigned to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization it lasted until 1969. It was replaced by the NATO nuclear sharing concept for tactical nuclear weapons, which, for example, included the provision of B57 nuclear depth bombs for the Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Nimrod until 1992.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower stated:
To this purpose, discussions were held around the use of Mk 15 thermonuclear weapons but no evidence of these actually being carried on British V bombers exists.
When Vickers Valiant aircraft were allocated to SACEUR in 1960 they carried either B28 or B43 thermonuclear weapons. When co-located with non SACEUR squadrons the SACEUR squadrons were often fenced off with six foot fences on the QRA pads. These were allowed to be carried by the RAF under control of SACEUR on the same basis as Project E weapons carried by the RAF, i.e. U.S. guardians present at all times. This of course came to an end when all the Valiants were grounded on 9 December 1964. The B28 bomb later became famous as a result of the Palomares incident in 1966.

List of Knight's Cross recipients 16th SS Panzer Grenadier Division Reichsführer SS

16th SS Panzergrenadier Division "Reichsführer-SS". was a formation of the Waffen-SS during World War II.
It was formed in November 1943 when Volksdeutsche recruits were added to the Sturmbrigade Reichsführer SS, which was then upgraded to divisional status. The majority of the recruits were from Norway.
A Kampfgruppe ("combat group") from the division fought at the Anzio beachhead, while the rest of the division took part in the occupation of Hungary. 
It fought in Italy as a unit from May 1944 until being transferred to Hungary in February 1945. In late summer 1944, while retreating towards the Gothic Line positions in the Appennini mountains, some units of this division committed several major atrocities against civilians in Sant'Anna di Stazzema and Marzabotto.
The division surrendered to British forces near Klagenfurt, Austria at the end of the war.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573" of September 1, 1939 instituted the Iron Cross and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. As the war progressed some of the recipients distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849" of June 3, 1940. In 1941 two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613" of September 28, 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the last and final grade, the Knight's Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11" of December 29, 1944 concluded the variants of the Knight's Cross.
Prerequisites.
To qualify for the Knight's Cross, a soldier had to already hold the 1939 Iron Cross First Class, though the Iron Cross I Class was awarded concurrently with the Knight's Cross in rare cases.
Unit commanders could also be awarded the medal for exemplary conduct by the unit as a whole.
Grades.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was divided into five grades, excluding the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross:

Society of Estonian Literati

The Society of Estonian Literati ( - EKmS) was an influential association of Estonian intellectuals based in Tartu between the years 1871 to 1893.
History.
The articles of the Society of Estonian Literati was adopted in 1871. In March 1872 the first meeting was held in Viljandi. The society included the main Estonian writers, poets, artists and journalists of the time. Leading personalities were, among others, Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald, Hans Wühner, Jakob Hurt, Carl Robert Jakobson, Hugo Treffner and Johann Köler. 
The aim of the society was the promotion of the Estonian language and literature in to enrich Estonian social life and a greater understanding by Estonians of their history and culture. 
The society published approximately 100 items during its 18 year existence between 1873 to 1890). From 1887 the society also organized literary competitions. Under Jakob Hurt the Society systematically collected Estonian folk poetry. Members of the Society collected old documents, coins and ethnological artifacts. The society built an extensive library and organized numerous lectures. 
At the beginning of the 1880s were internal political disputes between Jacob Hurt and Carl Robert Jakobson on future direction. In 1881 Hurt left with a group of his followers and Jakobson died a year later. The beginning of the Russification of Estonia split the society further. One group took a moderate stance towards the Tsarist demands, the other was an Estonian nationalist faction who largely rejected these concessions. 
On 28 April 1893, the society was shut down by the Tsarist authorities.

Bicton House, Devon

Bicton House, or Bickton House, is a late 18th- or early 19th-century country house, which stands on the campus of Bicton College, Bicton, near Exmouth, East Devon. It is a Grade II* listed building.
It is located about three miles from Sidmouth, in Devonshire. It had been in the East Budleigh Hundred.
Manor.
12th and 13th centuries.
This manor was held in demesne by William Portitor, the king's door-keeper, at the time of the taking the Domesday Survey. It was held as the king's gaol for the county of Devon.
The manor of Bicton was granted by King Henry I to John Janitor. In 1229, Ralph Balistarius, or Le Balister (the cross-bow-bearer), occupied the manor. His descendants, the Alabasters, a corruption of Le Balister, held the manor for five generations. It then was passed to the Sacheville, or Sackville, and Copleston families through female heirs.
16th to 18th centuries.
The lord of Bicton held responsibility for managing the gaol, but it was removed from Bicton House to Exeter. It was purchased in the 16th century of the Coplestones by Sir Robert Denys (1525–1592) of nearby Holcombe Burnel, who built a new manor house and created one of the county's first enclosed deer parks. Sir Robert Denys's son, Sir Thomas Denys died and his daughter Anne Denys received the manor. She had married Sir Henry Rolle (d.1616) of Stevenstone, Devon and the estate was conveyed to her husband. Henry was the son of John Rolle, and great grandson to the founder of the Rolle family of Stevenstone, George Rolle (died 1552). Henry and the former Miss Deny's son, Dennis Rolle, Esquire died in 1638, leaving a son who died in his infancy and a daughter named Florence.
Henry's nephew, also named Henry, of Beam near Torrington, inherited the estate, but died without a living heir in 1647. The manor was then passed to John Rolle through marriage to his cousin Florence Rolle, co-heiress of Dennis Rolle, Esquire of Bicton, who at the time of his death in 1706 held nearly 40 manors in Devonshire and estates in Cornwall, Somersetshire, and Northamptonshire. John had married the heiress of Marrais and settled there. He was made Knight of the Bath (K.B.) and was a representative for the county. John and Florence had four sons, the eldest son was the grandfather of Henry was made Baron Role in 1748 and died in 1750 without issue and the title became extinct. In 1787 the lord of the manor was exonerated from the superintendence of the county gaol. The title Baron Rolle was revived in 1796, when Henry Rolle's nephew, John Rolle, Esquire was created a peer by the same style and title.
19th and 20th centuries.
In about 1800 John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (d.1842), son of Dennis Rolle (d.1797), replaced the old manor house with the existing two storey mansion, designed by architect James Wyatt and built in red brick and limestone.
The site was described about 1820 to have a "commanding full view of the British Channel" and ancient beech and oak trees within the estate's park. The mansion, with two extensive wings, held an extensive collection of art, including works by Rembrandt and Ruysdael. It looked over the village of Otterton, with its little church, and the "lovely peep" between the Saltern and the ocean. A Gothic lodge is located at the main entrance, followed by a rustic inner lodge. Another entrance is by a "neat cottage-lodge." An obelisk is seen from most parts of the ground.
John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle married the Hon. Louisa Trefusis, a relative and second daughter of Robert Trefusis, 17th Baron Clinton. He died without issue in 1842. The Stevenstone and Bicton estates, amounting to some , devolved by his will to Hon. Mark George Kerr Trefusis (1836–1907), then aged 6, the nephew of his second wife Louisa Trefusis (1794–1885) (daughter of Robert George William Trefusis, 17th Baron Clinton (1764–1797)), and second son of the 19th Baron Clinton. On his inheritance in 1852 he changed his surname to Rolle; he died without issue in 1907, his heir being his nephew Charles John Robert Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton (1863–1957).
The house was greatly extended, including the addition of a third storey to the main block, in 1898.
Agricultural college.
In 1947 the 21st Baron Clinton leased (and later in 1957 sold) the house and part of the grounds to Devon County Council for the creation of Bicton Farm Institute, which later became Bicton College. In 1957 the same property was sold to the council. The present Baron Clinton continues to own part of the grounds and Bicton Arena, used for equestrian events, and the headquarters of the Clinton Devon Estates Company, which owns some 25,000 acres of agricultural land in Devon, is situated nearby. 
During the second World War it housed St Ronan's School which is now based near Hawkhurst.

Prior to the 1957 Northwestern game, Van Pelt was bed-ridden with the flu, but despite the illness, he led the Wolverines to a 34-14 win. Van Pelt completed three of four passes in the game for 66 yards and two touchdowns, including a 45-yard touchdown pass to Gary Prahst. He also ran for a touchdown and successfully kicked three extra points. In a 24-7 win over Minnesota, Van Pelt was responsible for 18 of Michigan's points as he threw two touchdown passes (including a 37-yard completion to Bowers), kicked a field goal and added three extra points.
In his final game for Michigan, Van Pelt passed for 106 yards (including a 33-yard touchdown pass to Brad Myers), the highest single-game total during his three years Michigan career. However, it was not enough as Ohio State beat Michigan, 31-14.
After the 1957 season, Van Pelt played in two post-season all-star games. He played in the North-South Shrine Game at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida, throwing a touchdown pass for the winning North team. In January 1958, he also played in the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama.
In three years at Michigan, Maddock completed 66 of 134 passes for 989 yards, ten touchdowns and five interceptions. He also had two rushing touchdowns and one receiving touchdown.
Professional football.
Van Pelt was selected by the Washington Redskins in the fifth round (55th overall pick) of the 1958 NFL Draft. Instead of playing in the NFL, Van Pelt signed a contract in February 1958 to play for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. In his rookie season, Van Pelt began the season playing principally as a defensive halfback, but he got the chance to start at quarterback when Kenny Ploen was injured. He played so well in place of Ploen that he won the job as Winnipeg's starting quarterback. Van Pelt also handled placekicking for the Bombers. He set a Canadian Football League record with a 107-yard touchdown pass to Ernie Pitts during a 1958 game against Calgary. 
Van Pelt led the Blue Bombers to the Grey Cup championship. He scored a record 22 points (two touchdowns, two field goals and four extra points) in the 1958 Grey Cup championship game, as the Blue Bombers defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 35-28. Van Pelt's first touchdown came on a trick play when he pitched the ball to halfback Leo Lewis and then took a pass from Lewis to run untouched 29 yards into the end zone. His second touchdown was a game-winning touchdown in the fourth quarter—a one-yard run that gave the Bombers a 35-28 lead. In its game coverage, "The Montreal Gazette" reported:"Jimmy Van Pelt, a freshman import quarterback from the University of Michigan was the producer, director and principal actor in Winnipeg's unexpected decision over the defending champions. He scored 22 points for a new Grey Cup record. ... Van Pelt took over as the stream-lined Grey Cup hero ... the country's national football pin-up boy. The Flying Dutchman grabbed a surprise pass from Leo Lewis for one touchdown, plunged over center from one yard out for another."
During the 1958 season, Van Pelt completed 90 of 160 passes for 1,445 yards, nine touchdowns and ten interceptions.
In August 1959, Van Pelt dislocated a bone in his left hand during an exhibition game featuring a rematch of the Grey Cup championship game between Winnipeg and Hamilton. Despite the injury, Van Pelt was the starting quarterback in Winnipeg's season opener against the British Columbia Lions. Wearing a cast on his left wrist, Van Pelt scored 27 points as he threw three touchdown passes with his right hand, rushed for a fourth touchdown and kicked a field goal. Van Pelt led the Winnipeg team to another western division championship in 1959, but he suffered a shoulder separation late in the season. Before suffering the injury, Van Pelt was having the best year of his career. During the 1959 season, he completed 160 of 300 passes for 2,706 yards, 31 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. He also set a Western Conference record by throwing seven touchdown passes in a single game against the Rough Riders.
Winnipeg coach Bud Grant noted, "Until Van Pelt was injured, I was pretty sure we had a better team than the 1958 champions. ... For 32 games Van Pelt played 99 percent of the time at quarterback. ... Before he was injured Jim had the team moving real well." Winnipeg went on to win its second consecutive Grey Cup championship with Kenny Ploen playing quarterback in the championship game.
Van Pelt's football career was cut short when he was drafted into the United States Air Force in the summer of 1960 for a three-year period of service.
In November 1962, Van Pelt, then a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, watched the Blue Bombers defend their Grey Cup championship as the guest of the club. Winnipeg general manager Jim Ausley would have Van Pelt back "if he wants to play football again." 
In June 1963, Van Pelt announced that he would not resume his football career after his discharge from the Air Force. Van Pelt said he planned to take an accounting job in Chicago. In an interview with the "Winnipeg Tribune", he explained, "My wife and I talked it over for a long time and decided the job in Chicago was the best move."

Job ticket

Job tickets are monthly or annual season tickets, purchased en block from a regional transport association by public or private organisations for use by their staff.
Job tickets usually require the purchasing organisation to buy a large number of tickets (typically 20 or more), and for at least 50% of their workforce. 
In return job tickets offer a large discount on the price of individual season tickets. For very large organisations other special benefits are arranged, too, e.g. new bus routes to connect major employment sites.
Many organisations further reduce the cost of the season tickets to their staff by charging a reduced price, or passing the tickets on free of charge - effectively subsidising their employee's travel to work. In the United States, Commuter benefits in some cases add to the financial attractiveness of the arrangement.
Purchasing organisations are also responsible for ticketing administration, such as issuing of the photocards and the actual tickets.

Vicki Berger

Vicki Berger (born 1949) is an American businessperson and politician in the state of Oregon. A native Oregonian, she is a Salem civic leader and a Republican member of the Oregon House of Representatives. Her father came up with the idea for the Oregon Bottle Bill.
Early life.
Born Vicki Chambers in 1949, she was the youngest of three children of Richard Chambers. In 1967, she graduated from South Salem High School in the state’s capital city before she married Jerry Berger in 1969. The couple would have three children, and she earned a bachelors of arts degree in anthropology in 1974 from the University of Wyoming.
From 1972 to 1975, Berger worked as a bailiff for the county court. She would teach racquetball at Chemeketa Community College in the early 1980s and then as a project manager for a local manufacturing company from 1988 to 1995. That year she became a franchisee of a Lazerquick copy shop in West Salem, retaining ownership until 2000.
Civic leader.
In 1985, she joined the board of the Salem YMCA where she remained until 1998. From 1995 to 1998 she served as that organization’s first female president. Berger was on the Salem-Keizer School District board from 1988 to 1992 and helped lead the campaign for a bond measure for capital improvements in what is the state's second largest school district. In 2001, along with her husband, she shared the award as First Citizens from the local chamber of commerce.
Political career.
In August 2001, Berger announced she would run for a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives. In the May 2002, primary she defeated Greg Warnock and Irv Blake to win the Republican nomination. Berger defeated Democrat Lloyd Kumley in the November general election with 13,408 votes to 7,884. She joined the House beginning with the 2003 session representing District 20, which spans parts of Polk and Marion counties.
After running unopposed in the May 2004 primary, she beat Democrat Jeanne E. Deane 17,595 votes to 11,400 votes in general election. Berger again ran without competition in the Republican primary in 2006, and then beat her Democratic Party opponent Connie Garcia, collecting 13,382 votes to Garcia’s 9,040. During the 2007 to 2008 legislature she served on the Revenue Committee. In 2007, she worked to pass legislation to amend the Oregon Bottle Bill to require deposits on water bottles. Her father, Richard Chambers, was the person responsible for proposing the original bill that passed the Oregon Legislature in 1971.
She was the first Republican in the House to vote in favor of an increase in the tax on cigarettes to pay for more health insurance of children in 2007. Seeking a fourth term in 2008, Berger was unopposed in the May primary, and then defeated Richard Riggs in the November election to win another term. Her district covers parts of Salem, Independence, and Monmouth, and switched from a primarily Republican district to a primarily Democratic district in 2008. Berger is considered a moderate Republican whose votes are occasionally inline with the Democrats. Berger calls herself a fiscally conservative and business-oriented politician. In 2008, she became the first person in the Oregon House to be cross-nominated by the Independent Party of Oregon.

<doc id="20178842" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20178842" title="WAGR W class">
WAGR W class

The WAGR W class is a class of narrow gauge steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) and various heritage railways, and also, in slightly modified form, by the Silverton Tramway Co Ltd.
Engineering Background.
The class was first proposed by Chief Mechanical Engineer Fred Mills in 1947. However, the death of Mills in 1949 put a hold on the project, with his successor, Clarke, taking up the project on his appointment later that year.
Mills had requested Beyer, Peacock and Company to reserve capacity for their construction when the design was first proposed, however, by the time Clarke took over, Beyer, Peacock & Co. had identified a number of possible problems with the design. This led to a meeting in the UK in 1950, the outcome of which was a substantial redesign of the locomotive.
The resultant locomotive included many proprietary boiler and ancillary fittings, as well as parts interchangeability. The firebox was substantially altered to take into account the properties of Collie coal. This included a combustion chamber, thermic syphons and arch bar tubes.
The running gear is based heavily on Beyer, Peacock & Co.'s Standard Light Garratt, which was built for the South Australian Railways as its 400 class Garratt. The first 40 were delivered partially erected, whilst the final 20 were fully assembled prior to shipping. The last 20 had larger tenders, capable of holding an additional . All were delivered between April 1951 and June 1952.
Operational history.
The light axle load of the "W" class, 9.5t, gave it an availability across the entire WAGR Network. The class, essentially a freight engine, also hauled the crack passenger trains of the WAGR. It effectively replaced the aged O and G classes still working on lighter parts of the network.
The class had a reputation for being free steamers and strong pullers.
Although they have a well-deserved reputation for their reliability, like any new class the W locos suffered some minor teething problems, including ashpan failures, and leaks in and around the foundation ring. The leaks were traced to faulty welding. The class suffered from stay failures in its early days, particularly in and around the throat plate. The first to fail was W913 in 1952. At one point, no less than 34 of the class were in Midland or the region depots for stay repair. The problem was traced back to the thermic syphons creating significant water movement in the area, overstressing the boiler plates, as well as problems with the quality of the original stays. The syphons were progressively removed over a seven-year period, eliminating the problem.
Following the modification, the last of which was made in 1959, the class gave excellent service through to its retirement in 1971. As dieselisation of WAGR continued, the class was gradually moved to the southern parts of the network, where water and coal were available. Most of the class was scrapped in 1971, although 19 were held over at Midland until 1972.
Sister Locomotives.
Beyer, Peacock and Company built 4 additional engines (serial numbers 7418–7419, 7553–7554) to those ordered by the WAGR for the Silverton Tramway Company, Ltd in Broken Hill, NSW.
These locomotives were basically the same as those built for the WAGR, but included a cowling running from in front of the cab to the front of the smokebox. The Silverton locomotives were fitted with Westinghouse Air brakes, and an additional blow-down valve in the middle of the bottom of the boiler barrel.
The Silverton locomotives saw short service with the class being retired in 1961, after Silverton dieselised.
Preservation.
The "W" class have been the main stay of several tourist operators. Indeed the class have provided longer service to their tourist operator owners than they had to the WAGR.
Whilst most are still working on dedicated corridors, none work on a public railway network. The last train run on a public network was hauled by Ws in October 2006.
Partially because of their age, boiler problems appear to be emerging as a maintenance issue for the class. Most have had little more than routine maintenance since retirement from the WAGR.

Hashalom

Hashalom ("Peace") was a Sephardic journal published in Belgrade from 1903 until 1906. The number of pages differed from 8 to 24 and the format was 15×23 cm.
History and content.
The editor was Isaac Mitrani, articles were written in Judeo-Spanish in Rashi letters, and it basically brought “national news, Jewish history, religious education, very interesting stories” (novedades nasyonales, istorya de los đudeos, sensya reližyoza, kuentos muy kuryozos), as stated on the cover page. The magazine was decidedly Zionist-oriented, called for Jewish unity and the creation of a Jewish state. News usually concerned the persecution of Jews in Europe and appeals for help. Literary texts described themes from history or prominent persons from that time. The magazine did not have a precise publishing schedule, but depended on subscription payments. For example, the second issue of the third year was published at the beginning of spring 1906, on Purim, and the third one not before the beginning of summer of that year. At the end of that issue, the editorial board wrote an apology (Eskuza) in which they asked for understanding for the delay and informed their audience that timely subscription payments would enable bi-monthly publishing.
Although the magazine was printed in Belgrade, the editorial board moved from one city to another. It shows how the state boundaries did not represent any kind of obstacle and that the circulation of Jews among their communities throughout the Balkans went undisturbed. The editor of the second issue in the third year was Isaac Mitrani from Belgrade, while the editor of the third number of the same year was his relative Barouh Mitrani from Sofia.
Donations.
In one of the articles, the editorial board acknowledges the receipt of donations and appeals to readers to donate. It proves that the destiny of the magazine depended solely on its readers. This text also evinces that the magazine was read throughout the Balkan Peninsula:
"To our friends in Belgrade! We thank you for your promises: the anonymous reader who helped us with the costs of this number! We praise him from the depth of our heart, hoping the others would do the same! Friends in Sofia and Filipolje, we wait for your good promises: to our subscribers in Pazardzhik, Niš, Vidin, Yambol, Varna, Kragujevac, Dupnica, thank you for continuation of your favors to enable us continue: subscribers in Sarajevo and Šabac, we thank you as well" (Hashalom III, 2: 16).

<doc id="20178894" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20178894" title="Brownback trevally">
Brownback trevally

The brownback trevally, "Carangoides praeustus" (also known as the brown-backed trevally), is a species of small inshore marine fish classified in the jack family, Carangidae. The brownback trevally is distributed in two populations through the tropical waters of the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from the Persian Gulf east to India, South East Asia and the Indonesian islands. The species is distinguished from similar species by its completely scaled breast and black-tipped second dorsal fin, and is known to reach a maximum length of 25 cm. The brownback trevally inhabits inshore waters including bays and estuaries, where it preys on demersal crustaceans and small fish. Other aspects of its biology are poorly known, and it is of minor importance to fisheries, occasionally caught by hook and line or trawls. William Smith-Vaniz has recently suggested the two distinct populations may actually represent two distinct species.
Taxonomy and naming.
The brownback trevally is classified within the genus "Carangoides", one of a number of groups of fish referred to as jacks and trevallies. "Carangoides" is further classified in the family Carangidae, itself part of the suborder Percoidei and the order Perciformes; the perch-like fishes.
The species was first scientifically described by an unknown author in a publication entitled 'Memoir of the Life and Public Services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles', in which a chapter was dedicated to fish specimens Raffles had collected. The author is usually presumed to be the English zoologist Edward Turner Bennett, but due to a lack of evidence to support this, his name is placed in parentheses as required by the ICZN code. The species was here published under the name of "Caranx praeustus", with the holotype collected from Sumatra, Indonesia. This classification was later changed to the genus "Carangoides" by Pieter Bleeker, where it has remained. Two junior synonyms have been applied to the species, "Caranx ire" and "Caranx melanostethos", which are invalid under ICZN rules. The species specific epithet "praeustus" is Latin; meaning "burnt at the tip", in reference to its black dorsal lobe.
In the last revision of the carangids of the Indo-Pacific, William Smith-Vaniz found that the two separate populations have differing gill raker counts and breast squamation, leading him to suggest the possibility of these being two separate species. If further study indicates these are two separate species, the name "Carangoides ire" should be reinstated, as Georges Cuvier described a fish from this second western Indian Ocean population as "Caranx ire". 
Description.
The brownback trevally is silvery blue-grey dorsally, shading to silvery underneath, sometimes with a broad brassy midlateral zone. There is no dark opercular spot. The distal area of the second dorsal fin lobe is strongly black, usually with a white tip while the remainder of the fin is dusky. The caudal fin is yellow and all other fins are whitish to hyaline.
Distribution and habitat.
The brownback trevally is distributed in two distinct populations in the tropical waters of the Indo-west pacific region. The western population extends from the waters of Iran in the Persian Gulf to the Bay of Bengal off Bangladesh, with records also from the Maldives and Sri Lanka. The eastern population inhabits a wide region in the South East Asian and Indonesian region, from the Gulf of Thailand to Borneo, Philippines and Indonesia.
The brownback trevally is a coastal species, inhabiting both rocky and coral reefs, as well as bay and estuary environments. The species prefers calm, sheltered waters. 
Biology and fishery.
The biology of the brownback trevally is known only from a single research study on its diet, and observational evidence recorded by divers. The study was located in the South China Sea, and focused on the diets of two species of sillaginids, with investigations into the trophic relationships of fish in the region. It was found the brownback trevally primarily consumes shrimps, with lesser amounts of calanoid copepods and small fish also taken. Observations indicate the fish form schools of up to 13 fish, which patrol reefs, and are inquisitive of divers. In Hong Kong waters, the fish is present from April to October, with a darkening of the fishes colour appearing to indicate spawning occurs in September at this locality.
The brownback trevally is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, often taken as bycatch in various trawling and hook and line operations. It is generally not distinguished from other trevally species, and no catch statistics are reported. It is also often taken by small artisanal fisheries by various inshore fish traps.

St Mary's Church, Hemel Hempstead

St Mary's Church, Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, is the parish church of the town and its oldest place of worship.
Background.
Its construction was commenced in 1140 and was dedicated in 1150 although construction continued for another 30 years.
It is cruciform in shape, with chancel, the first part to be built, nave south and north transepts, and a tower. A spire, one of the tallest in Europe was added in the 14th century with a total height of 200 feet. It is topped by a gilded weather vane. The church is built from the local clunch stone and flint with some addition of Roman bricks. The architecture is Norman throughout apart from porches added in the 14th and 15th centuries.
A 19th century vestry was added on the north east corner.
In 1302 a cell to Ashridge Priory was founded in Hemel Hempstead and the church had collegiate status until the Dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. A door at the base of the tower allowed the monks access to the church and avoided them mixing with the townspeople.
It is not known why such a grand church was constructed in what at the time was a small hamlet.
The church contains a memorial to Sir Astley Paston Cooper. There is a Walker organ which was refurbished in 2008.
A ring of five bells was recorded in the reign of Edward VI. None of these remain and the present ring is of 8 bells dating from 1590 to 1767. In 1950, as part of the 800th anniversary, the bells were retuned by Gillett and Johnston of Croydon and rehung on steel frames with completely new fittings. The eight bells are inscribed as follows:
1. (Treble) Lester and Pack - 1758
2. Lester and Pack - 1758
3. Chandler made me - 1688
4. Praise the Lord - 1633
5. Lawdate Domini - undated
6. God save King James - 1604
7. Sana Manet Christi - 1617
8. (Tenor) Lester and Pack - 1767 
The font is original Norman, although surrounded by 19th century decoration.

Charles Rainsford

General Charles Rainsford (3 February 1728 – 24 May 1809) was a British Army officer.
Career.
He was the second son of alderman Francis Rainsford (died 1770) and his wife, Isabella and received his first education from a cleric friend of Francis's at Great Clacton. His uncle, also Charles Rainsford (died 1778), was deputy lieutenant of the Tower of London and used his influence to get him made second cornet in General Bland's 3rd dragoons in March 1744, a unit at that time active in the Flanders theatre of the War of the Austrian Succession. Rainsford joined it immediately, carrying its standard at and soon after being appointed ensign in the Coldstream Guards. With his new unit he returned to England to face the Jacobite rising, rising to major of brigade and colonel's aide-de-camp. He then served as private secretary to Tyrawley, governor of Gibraltar (1756–7) before returning to England again in 1760. The following year he was given a company to command under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in Germany, before re-joining Tyrawley as aide-de-camp, brigadier-general and chief engineer in 1762 to face the threatened Spanish invasion of Portugal. Ordered home in 1763, with promotion second major in the Grenadier Guards and equerry to William, duke of Gloucester (1766–80), he commanded the army detachment at the king's bench prison at Southwark after the May 1768 riot.
He also served as MP for Maldon (1772–74) until his patron William Nassau de Zuylestein, 4th Earl of Rochford's nephew and heir was elected. He also held Bere Alston (1787–88) thanks to help from Algernon Percy, Lord Lovaine (brother of Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland), leaving it over the Regency Bill, with Lovaine backing the government, but Gloucester and Northumberland opposing it. He was rewarded by Northumberland with Newport, Cornwall (1790–96), before leaving parliament. He had taken little part in parliamentary proceedings, serving at the same time as governor of Chester (1776–96), king's aide-de-camp (1777–82), commander of the troops stationed in Hyde Park and then Blackheath against the Gordon Riots (1780) and nominal commander of the Minorca garrison (1782, though it surrendered to the Spanish before he arrived to take up the post). He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1779 (he was also a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, a Rosicrucian, a freemason and a dabbler in alchemy). In 1782 Rainsford and Benedict Chastanier reached out to kindred Illuminist groups in Berlin and Paris by publishing a brochure in French about degrees of the Universal Society. On summer 1783 Rainsford and William Bousie, an Anglo-French merchant, began corresponding with the Parisian lodge of the Philaléthes, preparatory to the Philaléthes convention in Paris in April 1785 to review the rites of many para-Masonic and esoteric societies. Rainsford provided information on Emanuel Swedenborg, Baal Shem of London and the Kabbalistic symbolism of higher degrees. He was then sent to be Robert Boyd's second-in-command at Gibraltar on the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, and took over after Boyd's death as Governor (1794–95). On his return to England he became governor of Cliff Fort, Tynemouth, his last active posting. On his death in London in 1809 he was buried in a vault in the chancel of the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London, alongside his first wife, his father and his uncle Charles.
Marriages and issue.
He and Elizabeth had three children:

Andrew Dalgleish

Andrew Dalgleish (1853 – 1888) on Karakoram Pass, between Ladakh, India and China was a Scottish trader, traveller and government agent during the Great Game.
Life and murder.
He took part in the first trading venture of the Central Asian Trading Company, the company having been set up in 1873 with the encouragement of Robert Barkely Shaw. Dalgleish was one of the first British traders in Ladakh, engaged in trans-Karakoram trade in the 1870s and 1880s. He married a Yarkandi wife. He had for some years traded between Yarkand and Leh and he was fluent in Uyghur.
Dalgleish was murdered by an Afghan named Daud Mohammad, a Kakar Pathan from Quetta who was once a merchant but had gone bankrupt. According to Hamilton Bower, in May 1888 Dalgleish, accompanied by some pilgrims and servants, left Leh for Yarkand. Several days into their journey they were joined by Mohammad. On April 8, 1888 the party crossed the Karakoram Pass and set up some tents to rest. While drinking tea in a tent Dalgleish and Mohamed had a conversation regarding Mohammad’s debts. Mohammad excused himself and then returned with a gun and fired into the tent, striking Dalgleish in the shoulder. Dalgleish escaped from the tent but Mohammad pursued him with a sword. Mohammad did not immediately flee and instead forced Dalgleish's servants to make him a meal him and then he slept in his victim's tent. The next day Mohammad departed and Dalgleish's servants and pilgrims made their way to Yarkand. The British community in Yarkand expressed their outrage over the murder and pleaded with the local yamen to have the murdered arrested. Mohammad later arrived in Kashgar and despite pleas from the Russian Consul Nikolai Petrovsky local officials refused to arrest Mohammad.
During his travels through Qing China's Xinjiang Province from 1889–90, British military officer Hamilton Bower attempted without success to pursue Dalgleish's killer. Mohammad was arrested in 1890 in Samarkand (then Russia) and committed suicide in prison.
A small memorial made of marble slab was erected by Bower on the desolate site of his death. It read in English and Persian, "Here fell Andrew Dalgleish, murdered by an Afghan, April 6th, 1888."
His resting place is in a Christian cemetery in Leh, Ladakh.

Robert Boyd (British Army officer)

Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Boyd KB (c.1710 - 13 May 1794) was a British Army officer.
Life.
Boyd was baptized on 20 April 1710 at Richmond, Surrey and attended Glasgow University before entering the army in his father Ninian's profession of civilian storekeeper. In 1756 he served at the Siege of Minorca, and attempted to reach Admiral John Byng's fleet in an open boat with a message from the besieged Garrison Commander William Blakeney. Boyd was a witness at the subsequent court-martial at which Byng was tried for the loss of the Garrison.
He subsequently became commissary general to the Marquess of Granby in Germany (1758 to 1759); he then rose through the officer ranks to be three-times Governor of Gibraltar (1776 to 1777, 1790 and 1790 to 1794). Boyd considered that his and General Sir William Green's work on the King's Bastion in Gibraltar was so important that he asked to be buried there. The site of his burial is not indicated but his body is lost under cement used to strengthen the building still further in the 19th century.

Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)

The Siege of Fort St Philip (commonly known in Britain as the Fall of Minorca or Siege of Minorca) took place in 1756 during the Seven Years War.
Siege.
A French force under the command of the Duke de Richelieu landed on the island and besieged the British garrison, forcing them to surrender after a lengthy siege. A British relief force under Admiral John Byng sailed with the purpose of saving the island, but after the naval Battle of Minorca Byng withdrew to Gibraltar, and the resistance of the garrison finally collapsed. Byng was later blamed for the loss of Minorca, and executed by firing squad.
The garrison's resistance had been considered lengthy and honourable enough for them to be allowed to march out carrying their arms and be shipped back home to Britain, a common convention at the time. Blakeney was absolved of any blame for the loss of the island, and was later awarded an Irish peerage in recognition of his defence of Fort St Phillip.
Aftermath.
Hyacinthe Gaëtan de Lannion was appointed the first French Governor of Minorca. A British naval squadron led by Sir Edward Hawke sent out to replace Byng arrived off Minorca shortly after the surrender. As Hawke did not have enough troops on board to land and mount a siege to retake the island he departed, cruising in the waters off Marseilles for three months before sailing home. He was later criticised for failing to mount a blockade of the island, which might have forced it to surrender through starvation.
The French held on to Minorca for the remainder of the war, the only British territory they were to occupy, and at the Treaty of Paris it was returned to Britain in exchange for Guadeloupe. Minorca was captured from the British again in 1781 during the Anglo-Spanish War, after which it was ceded to Spain.

Jean-François Tartu

Jean-François Tartu (Recouvrance, 11 October 1751 – "Uranie", off Gascogne, 24 October 1793) was a French Navy officer, and hero of the French Revolution.
Tartu took part in the American War of Independence as a non-commissioned officer, taking part in several significant battles in the fleet of Admiral d'Estaing. After the end of the war, he worked at the fnaval foundry of Indret.
At the French Revolution, Tartu became a minor political figure; he assured the interim direction of the foundry, and at the outbreak of the war with Britain, obtained command of the frigate "Uranie". He was killed in action on 24 October 1793 while disabling HMS "Thames". Tartu was hailed as a hero, and "Uranie" was renamed "Tartu" in his honour. 
Career.
Tartu was born to a family of fishers. He joined the French Royal Navy in 1766 as a sailor, at the age of 15, raising to master gunner. 
Service on "Fortunée".
After enlisting in the French Royal Navy, Tartu was appointed as master gunner on the frigate "Fortunée", under Bernard de Marigny. On "Fortunée", he took part in the Battle of Ushant. 
In 1779 sailed to Fort Royal to take part in a squadron under Lamotte-Picquet in the fleet of Admiral d'Estaing. On the background of the naval operations in the American Revolutionary War, "Fortunée" took part in the French operations on the Caribbean theater of the American Revolutionary War, notably in the Capture of Grenada.
In December 1779, "Fortunée" sailed in consort with the 32-gun "Blanche", under La Galissonière, and the 20-gun corvette "Ellis", under Captain Fonteneau, to ferry troops that had fought in the Siege of Savannah back to various French colonies of the Caribbean. On 21 December, between 15 and 18 miles off Guadeloupe, the frigate squadron met a British four-ship division under Rear-Admiral Parker, comprising the 74-gun HMS "Suffolk", "Magnificent", HMS "Vengeance" and the 64-gun "Stirling Castle", sent by Rear-Admiral Rowley to intercept it. As the British squadron flew the French flag, the frigates continued on their route and approached until the ships hoisted British colours and gave chase; a running battle ensued and in the course of the next hours, the frigates were overhauled by the 74-guns and struck their colours, "Fortunée" surrendering after a two-hour cannonade, surrounded by two ships. Tartu was taken prisoner with the crew of "Fortunée".
Service under Marigny.
After being exchanged, Tartu served on "Sphinx", again under Marigny. He took part in the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780, where he was wounded.
Returned to France, Tartu was appointed to the "Vaillant", again under Marigny, on which he took part in the Battle of the Chesapeake. He transferred to . and on to "César".
On "César", Tartu took part in the Battle of the Saintes. Marigny was mortally wounded, and entrusted Tartu with jewelry before dying. "César" blew up, throwing Tartu overboard; he was rescued by the British, who seized the jewelry.
Naval foundry of Indret.
Tartu was released at the Peace of Paris; he returned to Brest and married.
Upon his return, Tartu worked at the naval foundry of Indret. In 1786, he was promoted to "sous-lieutenant de vaisseau", and appointed controller the next year. Despite the money bestowed by these promotions, Tartu lived in relative poverty due to his 7-child family. In March 1791, he was made a Knight in the Order of Saint-Louis.
Political activities during the French Revolution.
After the outbreak of the French Revolution, the director of the foundry emigrated and was replaced by a militant Republican. Tartu was elected substitute deputy to the National Convention for Loire-Inférieure; he never served at the Convention in this capacity, but in early 1793, he accompanied représentant en mission Fouché to Paimboeuf.
Tartu went on to serve as interim dorector for the foundry of Indret. Tartu was promoted to Captain in January 1793. After France declared war to Britain on 1 February 1793, Tartu requested command of a warship. On 13 March, he was appointed to command the 40-gun frigate "Uranie", then under commissioning in Rochefort.
Service on "Uranie".
In June, Tartu returned to Indret to dispose of rusted cannonball from Rochefort in the foundry and to recruit crewmembers. "Uranie" departed Rochefort in August, and engaged in commerce raiding. On 25 August, Tartu observed the Ancien Régime custom of firing salvoes for Saint Louis Day. After completing her patrol, "Uranie" returned to Rochefort.
"Uranie" departed for another patrol in the Bay of Biscay on 24 September, in a frigate squadron under Captain Allemand consisting of the frigates "Carmagnole", "Résolue", "Sémillante" and "Uranie" with the brig-corvette "Espiègle". "Uranie" captured two Spanish brigs, which were scuttled, a wheat merchantmen from Genoa and a British merchantman. On 22 October, the squadron sighted the 16-gun Spanish brig "Alcoudia" and Allemand detached "Uranie" to capture her. "Uranie" also captured the liner "Quiros". On 24 October, "Uranie" met with the 32-gun HMS "Thames". In the ensuing Action of 24 October 1793, "Uranie" engaged in an artillery duel rather than attempting a boarding, as she lacked 60 of her sailors, despatched in prize crews over three captured ships, and was burdened with over 260 prisoners.
In the artillery duel, "Thames" lost most of her rigging and suffered heavy damaged to her port batteries. As she manoeuvered to train her intact starboard batteries on "Uranie", one of her cannonballs swept "Uranie"'s quarterdeck, killing two and severing Tartu's leg under the knee. The first officer of "Uranie", Lieutenant Wuibert, immediately rushed to take command as Tartu was brought below decks; soon afterwards, a dying Tartu instructed the lieutenant to break the engagement, as the drifting "Thames" was still heading towards the British blockade. 
"Uranie" suffered 4 killed and 7 wounded.
"Thames" was captured the next day by "Carmagnole", under Captain Allemand.
Legacy.
Tartu was hailed as a hero, and "Uranie" was renamed after him. His widow was awarded a pension by the National Convention, which furtermore passed a resolution that the crew of "Uranie" had bien mérité de la Patrie.
Tartu's 10-year old son was aboard "Uranie" and took part in the Action of 24 October 1793 as a boy; contemporary propaganda has it that on his death bed, Tartu told him
Two destroyers were later named in his honour (a "Vauquelin" class and a T 53).

Bullcroft Colliery

Bullcroft Colliery was a coal mine situated by the village of Carcroft north of Doncaster. The Bullcroft Colliery Company was formed in April 1908 and sinking of the shafts commenced immediately. In January 1909, at a depth of , a water course yielding over per minute was struck, it was capped back and sinking continued but only a month later, at , another water course, big enough to be described as a "subterranean river", was struck - too much for the steam operated pumps to cope with. Electric pumps were brought in to cope with the flow but even with a capability of per minute they couldn't cope and sinking was stopped so the full situation could be assessed. 
It was decided to withdraw the pumps and freeze the ground. Commencing January 1910 the first freeze was unsuccessful and a second, after the shafts had iron "tubbing" installed, commenced in February 1911. This was successful and sinking recommenced finally reaching the coal measures in December 1911.
The colliery worked normally until 1968 when it was joined to Brodsworth Colliery by a 550 yard drift and a 1,800 yard long conveyor made it possible that Bullcroft coal could be brought up at Brodsworth for washing etc. 
The collieries officially merged in 1970, the Bullcroft shafts were filled, using spoil from pit heaps and capped. Bullcroft Colliery kept its landsale depot to deal with concessionary coal and retained a locomotive to work it for about a year afterwards.
The colliery was served by a branch off the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway and a connection to the West Riding and Grimsby Railway.

The Pulse (Sirius)

The Pulse was a Sirius Satellite Radio channel that played music "from the '90s and Today" on Sirius Satellite Radio channel 9 and Dish Network channel 6012.
The Pulse began on July 1, 2002 as part of the newly launched Sirius lineup, with the same music and format heard on the current Pulse. By November 4, 2002, when I-90 signed off the air, it became a 1990s and hot AC hybrid, even though it played 1990s urban music.
Every half hour, the old incarnation of The Pulse reviewed music news on tours, future albums, and other topics covered.
As part of the merger between Sirius and XM Satellite Radio, and the subsequent reorganization of the services' respective channel lineups on November 12, 2008, the old Pulse was replaced by The 90s on 9, bringing a 1990s pop channel back to the Sirius lineup for the first time since I-90 had signed off. The decision to drop the original Pulse was due to the fact the channel ranked ninth in the Sirius ratings, whereas XM's counterpart channel, Flight 26, ranked second. Flight 26 was added to the Sirius lineup and rechristened on both services as the new Pulse, which still lists its calls as X026-FM.

Contractual terms in English law

Contractual terms in English law is a topic which deals with four main issues. 
The terms of a contract are the essence of a contract, and tell you what the contract will do. For instance, the price of a good, the time of its promised delivery and the description of the good will all be terms of the contract.
What are terms.
A contractual "provision forming part of a contract" Each term gives rise to a contractual obligation, breach of which can give rise to litigation. Not all terms are stated expressly and some terms carry less legal gravity as they are peripheral to the objectives of the contract.
It is an objective matter of fact whether a term goes to the root of a contract. By way of illustration, an actress' obligation to perform the opening night of a theatrical production is a condition, whereas a singers obligation to perform during the first three days of rehearsal is a warranty.
Statute may also declare a term or nature of term to be a condition or warranty; for example the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s15A provides that terms as to title, description, quality and sample (as described in the Act) are conditions save in certain defined circumstances.
Status as a term.
Status as a term is important as a party can only take legal action for the non fulfillment of a term as opposed to representations or mere puffs. Legally speaking, only statements that amount to a term create contractual obligations. Statements can be split into the following types:
There are various factors that a court may take into account in determining the nature of a statement. These include:
The parol evidence rule limits what things can be taken into account when trying to interpret a contract. This rule has practically ceased operation under UK law, but remains functional in Australian Law.
Implied terms.
A term may either be expressed or implied. An Express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract.
Terms implied in fact.
The Privy Council established a five stage test in "BP Refinery Western Port v Shire of Hastings":
In Australia, the High Court has ruled that the test in BP Refinery applies only to formal contracts, while the test in "Byrne and Frew v Australian Airlines Ltd" shall apply to informal contracts:
Terms implied in law.
These are terms that have been implied into standardised relationships.
Common law.
These terms will be implied into all contracts of the same nature as a matter of law.
Statutory.
The rules by which many contracts are governed are provided in specialized statutes that deal with particular subjects. Most countries, for example, have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. For example, each American state except Louisiana has adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which regulates contracts for the sale of goods. The most important legislation implying terms under United Kingdom law are the Sale of Goods Act 1979, the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 which imply terms into all contracts whereby goods are sold or services provided.
Terms implied by custom or trade.
One is generally bound by the custom of the industry that one is in. To imply a term due to custom or trade, one must prove the existence of the custom, which must be notorious, certain, legal and reasonable
Course of dealing.
If two parties have regularly conduct business on certain terms, the terms may be assumed to be same for each contract made, if not expressly agreed to the contrary. The parties must have dealt on numerous occasions and been aware of the term purported to be implied. In "Hollier v Rambler Motors Ltd" four occasions over five years was held to be sufficient. In "British Crane Hire Corp Ltd v Ipswitch Plant Hire Ltd" written terms were held to have been implied into an oral in which there was no mention of written terms.
Good faith.
It is common for lengthy negotiations to be written into a heads of agreement document that includes a clause to the effect that the rest of the agreement is to be negotiated. Although these cases may appear to fall into the category of agreement to agree, Australian courts will imply an obligation to negotiate in good faith provided that certain conditions are satisfied
The test of whether one has acted in good faith is a subjective one; the cases suggest honesty, and possibly also reasonably. There is no such implied term under UK common law: an attempt was made by Lord Denning in a series of case during the 70s and 80s but they are no longer considered 'good law'. European legislation imposes this duty, but only in certain circumstances.
The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 reg 8 will render ineffective any 'unfair' contractual term if made between a seller or supplier and a consumer.
Regulation 5 of the Statutory Instrument further elaborates upon the concept of 'unfair', which is rather novel to English law. 'Unfair' is a term that was not individually negotiated (i.e. standard form) that "causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract to the detriment of the consumer". This is not possible if the term is not contrary to 'good faith'; such as in "Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank", wherein the lack of a seemingly unfair interest term would leave the bank open to a very poor deal whereby no interest could be charged.
"Subject to" contracts.
If a contract specifies "subject to contract", it may fall into one of three categories:
If a contract specifies "subject to finance", it imposes obligations on the purchaser:
This may also refer to contingent conditions, which come under two categories: condition precedent and condition subsequent.
Conditions precedent are conditions that have to be complied with before performance of a contract
With conditions subsequent, parties have to perform until the condition is not met.
Failure of a condition repudiates the contract this is not to necessarily discharge it. Repudiation will always gives rise to an action for damages.

Robert Atkyns (topographer)

Sir Robert Atkyns (1647–1711) was a topographer, antiquary, and Member of Parliament. He is best known for his county history, the "Ancient and Present State of Gloucestershire".
Sir Robert was born in 1647, the first son of Sir Robert Atkyns, chief baron of the Exchequer, and sometime speaker of the House of Lords. Thomas Atkyns, who had died in London 1401, had been succeeded in the fourth generation by one David, an eminent merchant in Chepstow, who removed before his death in 1552 to Tuffley, near Gloucester, which continued to be the family seat until the purchase of Sapperton, Gloucestershire, by Baron Atkyns in 1660. 
Robert was educated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford (admitted 1663), and Lincoln's Inn (admitted 1661). He was called to the Bar in 1668 but did not practise. He was Deputy Receiver-General of Law Duties (1671-1672), Receiver-General (1672-1673), Comptroller (1673-1679), Commissioner for Assessment for Gloucestershire (1673-1680, 1689-1690) and Deputy Lieutenant for Gloucestershire (1683-1688). He was knighted by Charles II on his visit to Bristol 5 Sept. 1663. 
He was elected M.P. for the borough of Cirencester (1679-85) and afterwards for the county of Gloucester (1685-1689). 
He died at his house in Westminster of dysentery, at the age of sixty-five, and was buried at Sapperton, where his monument is preserved. He had married Louise, the daughter of Sir George Carteret of Hawnes, Bedfordshire circa 1674. 
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November 1664. (As he would have been 17 years old at the time there is the possibility that it was his father who was elected).
Publications.
He is the author of the "Ancient and Present State of Gloucestershire", London, 1712. The first edition, now scarce, contains a fine portrait of the author by Van der Gucht, 
together with a series of views of seats in the county, drawn and engraved by Jan Kip in his earliest manner.

Bath Profile

The Bath Profile is an international Z39.50 Specification for Library Applications and Resource Discovery
The syntax of Z39.50 is abstracted from the underlying database structure; for example, if the client specifies an author search (Use attribute 1003), it is up to the server to determine how to map that search to the indexes it has at hand. This allows Z39.50 queries to be formulated without having to know anything about the target database; but it also means that results for the same query can vary widely among different servers. One server may have an author index; another may use its index of personal names, whether they are authors or not; another may have no suitable index and fall back on its keyword index; and another may have no suitable index and return an error.
An attempt to remedy this situation is the Bath Profile. It was named after Bath, England, where the working group first met in 1999. This document rigidly specifies the exact search syntax to employ for common bibliographic searches, and the expected behavior of Bath-compliant servers in response to these searches. Implementation of the Bath Profile has been slow but is gradually improving the Z39.50 landscape. The Bath Profile is maintained by Library and Archives Canada.

NC Vouliagmeni

The Nautical Club of Vouliagmeni, or "NOV" (Greek: Ναυτικός Όμιλος Βουλιαγμένης, "NOB") is an aquatic sports club, founded by local sportsmen in 1937 in the seaside resort of Vouliagmeni, south of Athens, Greece. The club is located on the eastern edge of the Mikro Kavouri peninsula, adjacent to the Astir Palace Hotel and overlooking the bay, town and lake of Vouliagmeni.
The club takes particular pride in being an "extended family" for all its past and present athletes. Almost all its coaches and sports staff are past club athletes, and members are encouraged to involve their children in club sports from the youngest age possible.
Crest and colours.
The club crest depicts a blue anchor set inside a white lifebuoy with eight crimson stripes; blue, white and crimson being the club colors.
Activities.
The club admits members and their guests and operates a marina, a waterskiing school, junior and Olympic competition sailing boats and facilities, an open-air, heated swimming pool, two rocky beaches, members' indoor and outdoor lounges, reading and conference rooms, a first-aid station, a gym, and an upscale restaurant. The club publishes a quarterly illustrated newsletter, the ""Tríaina"" (Τρίαινα, "Trident"), distributed free. As part of the celebrations for the club's seventy years, a memorial volume, ""In Search of the Sporting Ideal"", was published in 2008, in commemoration of the club's history. The volume chronicles the club's foundation and development, and pays particular tribute to the many club athletes who have taken part in Olympic Games and won Olympic medals. The most notable Olympic athlete to have been fostered at the club is windsurfer Nikolaos Kaklamanakis (gold medal, Atlanta Olympics, 1996, and silver medal, Athens Olympics, 2004).
The outdoor, heated pool hosts swimming, finswimming, synchronized swimming and water polo teams and the respective training schools for children. The club hosts two annual competition meetings for youngsters, the ""Tzeláteia"" swimming gala and the ""Chatzitheodórou"" water polo Cup, as well as annual water skiing and sailing events. In addition to regular training for its young athletes, the club organises training schools for beginners, open to all children interested in swimming, finswimming, water polo, boat sailing, windsurfing, synchronized swimming, and waterskiing. Four periods are offered per year in total, two (winter and spring) during school season and two more during the summer vacations.
Sports activities for members include aquarobics, aerobics, martial arts classes, long-distance sea swimming, water skiing, and Olympic and recreational sailing and windsurfing. The club also provides mooring for recreational boats owned by members. Several social events and functions are also held at the club, including concerts, art exhibitions, lectures, receptions, dinner parties, the Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve balls, the all-day "May Day at the Club" barbecue, and the midsummer "Full Moon Ball".
Water polo.
The women's and men's water polo teams are a traditional force in European water polo and have won many Greek and several European Championships and Cups. The club often hosts LEN Euroleague and LEN Cup tournaments, its star players consistently being capped for the Greek men's and women's national teams.
The women's team are the reigning Greek champions (2010) and also the reigning European champions for the second consecutive year (2009, 2010). In 2009 they won the LEN Champions' Cup in Kirishi, Russia, defeating the Italian champions, Orizzonte Catania, in the final. In 2010 they won the LEN Champions' Cup in Corfu, Greece, defeating the Russian champions, Kinef Kirishi, in the final.
In addition to the men's and women's teams, the club maintains water polo teams for girls and boys aged 9 and upwards, and participates in all relevant youth competitions. All teams train under the supervision of head coaches (2010) Gianni Giannouris and Alexia Kammenou, both former NOV players.

The Awakening Conscience

The Awakening Conscience (1853) is an oil-on-canvas painting by English artist William Holman Hunt, one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which depicts a young woman rising from her position in the lap of a man and gazing transfixed out of the window of a room. 
Initially the painting would appear to be one of a momentary disagreement between husband and wife, or brother and sister, but the title and a host of symbols within the painting make it clear that this is a mistress and her lover. The woman's clasped hands provide a focal point and the position of her left hand emphasizes the absence of a wedding ring. Around the room are dotted reminders of her "kept" status and her wasted life: the cat beneath the table toying with a bird; the clock concealed under glass; a tapestry which hangs unfinished on the piano; the threads which lie unravelled on the floor; the print of Frank Stone's "Cross Purposes" on the wall; Edward Lear's musical arrangement of Tennyson's poem "Tears, Idle Tears" which lies discarded on the floor, and the music on the piano, Thomas Moore's "Oft in the Stilly Night", the words of which speak of missed opportunities and sad memories of a happier past. The discarded glove and top hat thrown on the table top suggest a hurried assignation. The room is too cluttered and gaudy to be in a Victorian family home; the bright colours, unscuffed carpet, and pristine, highly-polished furniture speak of a room recently furnished for a mistress. Art historian Elizabeth Prettejohn notes that although the interior is now viewed as "Victorian" it still exudes the "'nouveau-riche' vulgarity" that would have made the setting distasteful to contemporary viewers. The painting's frame is decorated with further symbols: bells (for warning), marigolds (for sorrow), and a star above the girl's head (a sign of spiritual revelation). It also bears a verse from the Book of Proverbs (25:20): "As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart".
The mirror on the rear wall provides a tantalizing glimpse out of the scene. The window — opening out onto a spring garden, in direct contrast to the images of entrapment within the room — is flooded with sunlight. The woman's face does not display a look of shock that she has been surprised with her lover; whatever attracts her is outside of both the room and her relationship. The "Athenæum" commented in 1854: 
In some ways this painting is a companion to Hunt's Christian painting "The Light of the World", a picture of Christ holding a lantern as he knocks on an overgrown handleless door which Hunt said represented "the obstinately shut mind". The young woman here could be responding to that image, her conscience pricked by something outside of herself. Hunt intended this image to be "The Light of the World"'s "material counterpart in a picture representing in actual life the manner in which the appeal of the spirit of heavenly love calls a soul to abandon a lower life." In "Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood" Hunt wrote that Peggotty's search for Emily in "David Copperfield" had given him the idea for the composition and he began to visit "different haunts of fallen girls" looking for a suitable setting. He did not plan to recreate any particular scene from "David Copperfield"; he initially wanted to capture something more general: "the loving seeker of the fallen girl coming upon the object of his search", but he reconsidered, deciding that such a meeting would engender different emotions in the girl than the repentance he wanted to show. He eventually settled on the idea that the girl's companion could be singing a song that suddenly reminded her of her former life and thereby act as the unknowing catalyst for her epiphany.
The model for the girl was Annie Miller, who sat for many of the Pre-Raphaelites and to whom Hunt was engaged until 1859. The male figure may be based on Thomas Seddon or Augustus Egg, both painter friends of Hunt. The look on the girl's face in the modern painting is not the look of pain and horror that viewers saw when the painting was first exhibited, and which shocked and repulsed many of the contemporary critics. The painting was commissioned by Thomas Fairbairn, a Manchester industrialist and patron of the Pre-Raphaelites who later succeeded his father as 2nd Baronet, after Egg discussed Hunt's ideas and possibly showed him some of the initial sketches. Fairbairn paid Hunt 350 guineas. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1854, along with "The Light of the World". Fairbairn found himself unable to bear looking on the woman's expression day-to-day, so persuaded Hunt to soften it. Hunt started work but fell ill and allowed the painting to be returned to Fairbairn for display at the Birmingham Society of Artists exhibition in 1856 before he was completely happy with the result. Later he was able to work on it again and confided to Edward Lear that he thought he had "materially bettered it". As noted in the spandrels, Hunt retouched the painting in 1864 and again in 1886 when he repaired some work that had been carried out by a restorer in the interim.
The Victorian art theorist John Ruskin praised "The Awakening Conscience" as an example of a new direction in British art in which the narrative was created from the artist's imagination rather than chronicling an event. Ruskin's reading of the painting was also to a moral end. In an 1854 letter to "The Times" defending the work, he claimed that there is "not a single object in all that room...but it becomes tragical if read rightly". He was struck by both the stark realism of the room — Hunt had hired a room in a "maison de covenance" (where lovers would take their mistresses) in order to capture the feeling — and the symbolic overtones and compared the revelation of the subjects' characters through the interiors favourably with that of William Hogarth's "Marriage à-la-mode". 
The "common, modern, vulgar" interior is overwhelmed by lustrous, unworn objects that will never be part of a home. To Ruskin, the exquisite detail of the painting only called attention to the inevitable ruin of the couple: "The very hem of the poor girl's dress, at which the painter has laboured so closely, thread by thread, has story in it, if we think how soon its pure whiteness may be soiled with dust and rain, her outcast feet failing in the street". The idea of a visual morality tale, based on a single moment, influenced Augustus Egg's 1858 series of three paintings, "Past and Present". 
The painting was inherited by Fairbairn's son, Sir Arthur Henderson Fairbairn, 3rd Baronet. It was sold anonymously at Christie's in January 1946 and had been bought by Colin Anderson by 1947. It was donated to the Tate Gallery by Sir Colin and Lady Anderson in 1976.

Gwilym Davies (minister)

Gwilym Davies CBE (24 March 1879 – 26 January 1955) was a Welsh Baptist minister, who spent much of his life attempting to enhance international relations through supporting the work of the League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations. He also established the Annual World Wireless Message to Children in 1922, and was the first person to broadcast in Welsh, on St David's Day 1923.
Life.
Davies was born on 24 March 1879 at Bedlinog, Glamorgan, in south Wales, to D. J. Davies, a local Baptist minister. He was educated at the grammar school in Llandeilo before training for ordination at the Midland Baptist College in Nottingham. He then won a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford. He was ordained in 1906, serving first at Broadhaven in Pembrokeshire and then, between 1908 and 1915, in Carmarthen. With encouragement from David Davies (later Lord Davies of Llandinam), he helped to set up the Welsh School of Social Service in 1911. He served as secretary, chairman and president. Between 1915 and 1919, he was the minister in Abergavenny and then he ministered in Llandrindod Wells between 1919 and 1922.
In 1922, he retired from active ministry and spent the rest of his life promoting world peace. He travelled extensively, spending much of his time in Geneva and Cardiff. He established the Annual World Wireless Message to Children in 1922, a message of peace from the youth of Wales to the youth of the world. On St David's Day (1 March) 1923, Davies became the first person to broadcast in the Welsh language. He was the co-founder (with Lord Davies) and honorary director (1922 to 1945) of the Welsh branch of the League of Nations Union, and honorary international secretary of the Union until the League of Nations was dissolved. He organised annual conferences on international education at Gregynog between 1922 and 1939. During the Second World War, he directed the Welsh Education Committee as it drafted a model constitution for an international education organisation, and his draft was influential in the creation of Unesco. After the Second World War, Davies supported the work of the United Nations and Unesco, becoming the first president of the Welsh National Council of the United Nations Association and helping to establish the Welsh Unesco Committee. He wrote articles for journals and newspapers, some of which were collected as "" ("The World Yesterday and Today") (1938). He also wrote "International Education in the Schools of Wales and Monmouthshire" (1926), "The Ordeal of Geneva" (1933), and "Intellectual co-operation between the Wars" (1943), as well as "The Gregynog Conferences on International Education 1922–37" (1952).
He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1948 King's Birthday Honours; in 1954, the University of Wales awarded him an honorary doctorate of laws (LLD). He died in hospital in Aberystwyth on 26 January 1955, aged 75. His ashes were scattered at Lavernock Point, Penarth, where Marconi transmitted the first radio messages across water.

Halloween (1978 film)

Halloween is a 1978 American independent slasher horror film directed and scored by John Carpenter, co-written with producer Debra Hill, and starring Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis in her film debut. The film was the first installment in what became the "Halloween" franchise. The plot is set in the fictional Midwestern town of Haddonfield, Illinois. On Halloween night in 1963, a six-year-old Michael Myers murders his older sister by stabbing her with a kitchen knife. Fifteen years later, he escapes from a psychiatric hospital, returns home, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode and her friends. Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis suspects Michael's intentions, and follows him to Haddonfield to try to prevent him from killing.
"Halloween" was produced on a budget of $325,000 and grossed $47 million at the box office in the United States, and $70 million worldwide, equivalent to $250 million as of 2014, becoming one of the most profitable independent films. Many critics credit the film as the first in a long line of slasher films inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" (1960). "Halloween" had many imitators and originated several clichés found in low-budget horror films of the 1980s and 1990s. Unlike many of its imitators, "Halloween" contains little graphic violence and gore. In 2006, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
Some critics have suggested that "Halloween" may encourage sadism and misogyny by identifying audiences with its villain. Other critics have suggested the film is a social critique of the immorality of youth and teenagers in 1970s America, with many of Myers's victims being sexually promiscuous substance abusers, while the lone heroine is depicted as innocent and pure, hence her survival (she is seen smoking cannabis in one scene however). Nevertheless, Carpenter dismisses such analyses. Several of "Halloween"s techniques and plot elements, although not founded in this film, have nonetheless become standard slasher movie tropes.
Plot.
On October 31, 1963, 6-year-old Michael Myers (Will Sandin) of Haddonfield, Illinois murders his older teenage sister Judith Myers (Sandy Johnson), stabbing her repeatedly with a butcher knife after she had sex with her boyfriend (David Kyle). Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, Michael escapes the hospital in Smith's Grove, Illinois where he had been committed since the murder, stealing the car that was to take him to a court hearing, the intention of which was for him to never be released.
The following day, Halloween, Michael, now dressed in blue coveralls and a white mask, returns to Haddonfield and begins stalking high school student Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) by appearing outside her class window and driving past her on the street. Informing her friends, Annie (Nancy Kyes) and Lynda (P. J. Soles), they dismiss her concerns. Later at her house, Laurie becomes startled and unnerved to see Michael outside in the yard staring into her room. Meanwhile, Michael's primary psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasence), anticipated Michael's return home and goes to the local cemetery, finding that Judith Myers' headstone is missing. Later on, Loomis approaches Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers), and the two quietly look for Michael.
That night, Laurie babysits a boy named Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews), while Annie babysits a girl named Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) across the street from the Doyle house. When Annie gets a call from her boyfriend, Paul, to pick him up, she takes Lindsey to the Doyle house. Annie gets in her car to pick up Paul but has her throat slashed by Michael, who was hiding in the backseat of her car. At the Doyle house, while he plays hide-and-seek with Lindsay, Tommy spots Michael carrying Annie's body and tries to tell Laurie, who doesn't believe in any "boogeyman" that Tommy says he saw. Later, Lynda and her boyfriend, Bob, enter the Wallace house and head to the bedroom, where they have sex. While downstairs to get a beer for Lynda, Bob is impaled on the wall by Michael with a kitchen knife. Michael appears in the bedroom doorway, pretending to be Bob in ghost attire. Gaining no response from him, Lynda suspects something is wrong and calls Laurie, just as Michael strangles her with the telephone cord.
Feeling unsettled, Laurie puts the kids to bed and heads over to the Wallace house, only to find Annie's body with Judith Myers' missing headstone and Lynda and Bob dead nearby. Suddenly, Laurie is attacked by Michael and falls backwards down the staircase. Fleeing the house, she screams for help, but to no avail. Running back to the Doyle house, she realizes she lost the keys and the door is locked, as she sees Michael approaching in the distance. Laurie panics and screams for Tommy to wake up and open the door quickly. Luckily, Tommy opens the door in time and lets Laurie inside. Laurie instructs the children to hide and then realizes the phone line is dead and that Michael has gotten into the house through a window. As she sits down in horror next to the couch, Michael appears and tries to stab her, but she counterattacks his move, stabbing him in the side of his neck with a lingering knitting needle.
Thinking that he's dead, Laurie goes upstairs telling Tommy and Lindsey she killed the "boogeyman", but Michael reappears in pursuit of her. Telling the kids to hide and lock themselves in the bathroom, Laurie opens a window to feign escape and hides in a bedroom closet. Not gullible, Michael tears a hole in the closet door to get to her. However, Laurie frantically undoes a clothes hanger to stick Michael in the eye, causing him to drop his knife which Laurie obtains to stab him. Michael collapses and Laurie exits the closet carefully before urging the kids to go call for help. Dr. Loomis sees Tommy and Lindsey running away from the house and suspects Michael could be inside. Back inside, Michael gets up and tries to strangle Laurie, but Dr. Loomis arrives in time to save her and shoot Michael in the head, then five more times in the chest for a total of six shots. Michael falls from the second-story patio onto the lawn below. Laurie asks Loomis if that was the "boogeyman", to which Loomis confirms. However, when Loomis looks over the balcony, he finds Michael's body is missing.
Production.
After viewing Carpenter's film "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) at the Milan Film Festival, independent film producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad sought out Carpenter to direct a film for them about a psychotic killer that stalked babysitters. In an interview with "Fangoria" magazine, Yablans stated, "I was thinking what would make sense in the horror genre, and what I wanted to do was make a picture that had the same impact as "The Exorcist"." Carpenter and his then-girlfriend Debra Hill began drafting a story originally titled "The Babysitter Murders", but, as Carpenter told "Entertainment Weekly", Yablans suggested setting the movie on Halloween night and naming it "Halloween" instead.
Akkad agreed to put up $300,000 for the film's budget, which was considered low at the time; (Carpenter's previous film, "Assault on Precinct 13", had an estimated budget of $100,000). Akkad worried over the tight, four-week schedule, low budget, and Carpenter's limited experience as a filmmaker, but told "Fangoria", "Two things made me decide. One, Carpenter told me the story verbally and in a suspenseful way, almost frame for frame. Second, he told me he didn't want to take any fees, and that showed he had confidence in the project". Carpenter received $10,000 for directing, writing, and composing the music, retaining rights to 10 percent of the film's profits.
Because of the low budget, wardrobe and props were often crafted from items on hand or that could be purchased inexpensively. Carpenter hired Tommy Lee Wallace as production designer, art director, location scout and co-editor. Wallace created the trademark mask worn by Michael Myers throughout the film from a Captain Kirk mask purchased for $1.98. Carpenter recalled how Wallace "widened the eye holes and spray-painted the flesh a bluish white. In the script it said Michael Myers's mask had 'the pale features of a human face' and it truly was spooky looking. I can only imagine the result if they hadn't painted the mask white. Children would be checking their closet for William Shatner after Tommy got through with it." Hill adds that the "idea was to make him almost humorless, faceless — this sort of pale visage that could resemble a human or not." Many of the actors wore their own clothes, and Curtis' wardrobe was purchased at J. C. Penney for around a hundred dollars.
The limited budget also dictated the filming location and time schedule. "Halloween" was filmed in 20 days in the spring of 1978 in South Pasadena, California and the cemetery at Sierra Madre, California. An abandoned house owned by a church stood in as the Myers house. Two homes on Orange Grove Avenue (near Sunset Boulevard) in Hollywood were used for the film's climax. The crew had difficulty finding pumpkins in the spring, and artificial fall leaves had to be reused for multiple scenes. Local families dressed their children in Halloween costumes for trick-or-treat scenes.
In August 2006, "Fangoria" reported that Synapse Films had discovered boxes of negatives containing footage cut from the film. One was labeled "1981" suggesting that it was additional footage for the television version of the film. Synapse owner Don May, Jr. said, "What we've got is pretty much all the unused original camera negative from Carpenter's original "Halloween". Luckily, Billy was able to find this material before it was destroyed. The story on how we got the negative is a long one, but we'll save it for when we're able to showcase the materials in some way. Kirkus should be commended for pretty much saving the Holy Grail of horror films." It was later reported, "We just learned from Sean Clark, long time "Halloween" genius, that the footage found is just that: footage. There is no sound in any of the reels so far, since none of it was used in the final edit."
Writing.
Yablans and Akkad ceded most of the creative control to writers Carpenter and Hill (whom Carpenter wanted as producer), but Yablans did offer several suggestions. According to a "Fangoria" interview with Hill, "Yablans wanted the script written like a radio show, with 'boos' every 10 minutes." Hill explained that the script took three weeks to write and much of the inspiration behind the plot came from Celtic traditions of Halloween such as the festival of Samhain. Although Samhain is not mentioned in the plot of the first film, Hill asserts that:
Hill wrote most of the female characters' dialogue, while Carpenter drafted Loomis' speeches on the evilness of Michael Myers. Many script details were drawn from Carpenter's and Hill's adolescence and early careers. The fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois was derived from Haddonfield, New Jersey, where Hill grew up, and most of the street names were taken from Carpenter's hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky. Laurie Strode was the name of one of Carpenter's old girlfriends and Michael Myers was the name of an English producer who had previously entered, with Yablans, "Assault on Precinct 13" in various European film festivals. In "Halloween", Carpenter pays homage to Alfred Hitchcock with two characters' names; Tommy Doyle is named after Lt. Det. Thomas J. Doyle (Wendell Corey) of "Rear Window" (1954), and Dr. Loomis' name was taken from Sam Loomis (John Gavin) of "Psycho", the boyfriend of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh, who is the real-life mother of Jamie Lee Curtis). Sheriff Leigh Brackett shared the name of a film screenwriter.
Casting.
The cast of "Halloween" included veteran actor Donald Pleasence and then-unknown actress Jamie Lee Curtis. The low budget limited the number of big names that Carpenter could attract, and most of the actors received very little compensation for their roles. Pleasence was paid the highest amount at $20,000, Curtis received $8,000, and Nick Castle earned $25 a day. The role of Dr. Loomis was offered to Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee; both declined the part due to the low pay (though Lee would later tell Carpenter that declining the role was his biggest career mistake). English actor Pleasence — Carpenter's third choice — agreed to star. Pleasence has been called "John Carpenter's big landing." Americans were already acquainted with Pleasence as the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the James Bond film "You Only Live Twice" (1967).
In an interview, Carpenter admits that "Jamie Lee wasn't the first choice for Laurie. I had no idea who she was. She was 19 and in a TV show at the time, but I didn't watch TV." He originally wanted to cast Anne Lockhart, the daughter of June Lockhart from "Lassie", as Laurie Strode. However, Lockhart had commitments to several other film and television projects. Hill says of learning that Jamie Lee was the daughter of "Psycho" actress Janet Leigh, "I knew casting Jamie Lee would be great publicity for the film because her mother was in "Psycho"." "Halloween" was Curtis' feature film debut and launched her career as a "scream queen" horror star. Another relatively unknown actress, Nancy Kyes (credited in the film as Nancy Loomis) was cast as Laurie's friend Annie Brackett, daughter of Haddonfield sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers). Kyes had previously starred in "Assault on Precinct 13" (as had Cyphers) and happened to be dating "Halloween"'s art director Tommy Lee Wallace when filming began. Carpenter chose P. J. Soles to play Lynda Van Der Klok, another friend of Laurie's, best remembered in the film for dialogue peppered with the word "totally." Soles was an actress known for her supporting role in "Carrie" (1976) and her minor part in "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble" (1976). According to one source, "Carpenter realized she had captured the aura of a happy go lucky teenage girl in the 70s."
The role of "The Shape" — as the masked Michael Myers character was billed in the end credits — was played by Nick Castle, who befriended Carpenter while they attended the University of Southern California. After "Halloween", Castle became a director, taking the helm of films such as "The Last Starfighter" (1984), "The Boy Who Could Fly" (1986), "Dennis the Menace" (1993), and "Major Payne" (1995).
Direction.
Historian Nicholas Rogers notes that film critics contend that Carpenter's direction and camera work made "Halloween" a "resounding success". Roger Ebert remarks, "It's easy to create violence on the screen, but it's hard to do it well. Carpenter is uncannily skilled, for example, at the use of foregrounds in his compositions, and everyone who likes thrillers knows that foregrounds are crucial ..."
The opening title, featuring a jack-o'-lantern placed against a black backdrop, sets the mood for the entire film. The camera slowly moves toward the jack-o'-lantern's left eye as the main title theme plays. After the camera fully closes in, the jack-o'-lantern's light dims and goes out. Film historian J.P. Telotte says that this scene "clearly announces that film's primary concern will be with the way in which we see ourselves and others and the consequences that often attend our usual manner of perception". During the conception of the plot, Yablans instructed "that the audience shouldn't see anything. It should be what they thought they saw that frightens them". Carpenter seemingly took Yablans' advice literally, filming many of the scenes from Michael Myers's point-of-view that allowed audience participation. Carpenter is not the first director to employ this method or use of a steadicam; for instance, the first scene of "Psycho" offers a voyeuristic look at lovers in a seedy hotel. Telotte argues, "As a result of this shift in perspective from a disembodied, narrative camera to an actual character's eye ... we are forced into a deeper sense of participation in the ensuing action". Along with the 1974 Canadian horror film "Black Christmas", "Halloween" made use of seeing events through the killer's eyes.
The first scene of the young Michael's voyeurism is followed by the murder of Judith seen through the eye holes of Michael's clown costume mask. According to one commentator, Carpenter's "frequent use of the unmounted first-person camera to represent the killer's point of view ... invited to adopt the murderer's assaultive gaze and to hear his heavy breathing and plodding footsteps as he stalked his prey". Another technique that Carpenter adapted from Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" (1960) was suspense with minimal blood and gore. Hill comments, "We didn't want it to be gory. We wanted it to be like a jack-in-the box." Film analysts refer to this as the "false startle" or "the old tap-on-the-shoulder routine" in which the stalkers, murderers, or monsters "lunge into our field of vision or creep up on a person." Carpenter worked with the cast to create the desired effect of terror and suspense. According to Curtis, Carpenter created a "fear meter" because the film was shot out-of-sequence and she was not sure what her character's level of terror should be in certain scenes. "Here's about a 7, here's about a 6, and the scene we're going to shoot tonight is about a 9½", remembered Curtis. She had different facial expressions and scream volumes for each level on the meter.
Carpenter's direction for Castle in his role as Myers was minimal. For example, when Castle asked what Myers' motivation was for a particular scene, Carpenter replied that his motivation was to walk from one set marker to another. The documentary titled "Halloween Un-masked", featured in the 22nd anniversary DVD of "Halloween", John Carpenter states he also instructed Castle to tilt his head a couple of times as if he was observing the corpse, particularly in the scene when Myers impaled one of his victims against a wall.
Music.
Another major reason for the success of "Halloween" is the moody musical score, particularly the main theme. Lacking a symphonic soundtrack, the film's score consists of a piano melody played in a 10/8 or "complex 5/4" meter composed and performed by director John Carpenter. Critic James Berardinelli calls the score "relatively simple and unsophisticated", but admits that ""Halloween"'s music is one of its strongest assets". Carpenter stated in an interview, "I can play just about any keyboard, but I can't read or write a note." In the end credits, Carpenter bills himself as the "Bowling Green Philharmonic Orchestra" for performing the film's score, but he did receive assistance from composer Dan Wyman, a music professor at San José State University.
Some songs can be heard in the film, one being an untitled song performed by Carpenter and a group of his friends who formed a band called The Coupe DeVilles. The song is heard as Laurie steps into Annie's car on her way to babysit Tommy Doyle. Another song, "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" by classic rock band Blue Öyster Cult, appears in the film.
The soundtrack was first released in the United States in October 1983, by Varese Sarabande. It was subsequently released on Compact Disc in 1985, re-released in 1990, and again in 2000.
Release.
Theatrical run.
"Halloween" premiered on October 25, 1978 in Kansas City, Missouri (at the AMC Midland/Empire) and sometime afterward in Chicago, Illinois, and in New York City. It had its Los Angeles debut October 27, 1978. It opened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on November 22, 1978. The film grossed $47 million in the United States and an additional $23 million internationally, making the theatrical total $70 million.
On September 7, 2012, the official Halloween Movies Facebook page announced that the original "Halloween" would be theatrically re-released starting October 25, 2013 in celebration of the film's 35th anniversary in 2013. A new documentary was screened before the film at all locations, entitled, "You Can't Kill the Boogeyman: 35 Years of Halloween," written and directed by HalloweenMovies.com webmaster Justin Beahm.
Television rights.
In 1980, the television rights to "Halloween" were sold to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) for $4 million. After a debate among Carpenter, Hill and NBC's Standards and Practices over censoring of certain scenes, "Halloween" appeared on television for the first time in October 1981. To fill the two-hour time slot, Carpenter filmed twelve minutes of additional material during the production of "Halloween II". The newly filmed scenes include Dr. Loomis at a hospital board review of Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis talking to a then 6-year-old Michael at Smith's Grove, telling him, "You've fooled them, haven't you Michael? But not me." Another extra scene features Dr. Loomis at Smith's Grove examining Michael's abandoned cell after his escape and seeing the word "Sister" scratched into the door. Finally, a scene was added in which Lynda comes over to Laurie's house to borrow a silk blouse before Laurie leaves to babysit, just as Annie telephones asking to borrow the same blouse. The new scene had Laurie's hair hidden by a towel, since Curtis was by then wearing a much shorter hairstyle than she had worn in 1978. The television scenes were released on a two-tape "limited-edition" VHS set of the film and the television version of the film was released on a second disc in the two-disc "limited-edition" DVD release of the film in 1999, by-itself in 2001 as "Halloween: Extended Edition" on VHS and DVD and as part of the "Halloween: 30th Anniversary Commemorative Set" along with the original "Halloween" on DVD and Blu-ray, disc one from the "25 Years of Terror" documentary DVD and the DiviMax special editions of two of its sequels: ' and ' in 2008.
Home video release.
Since "Halloween"s premiere, it has been released on VHS, LaserDisc, DVD, UMD and Blu-ray HD format. Early VHS versions were released by Media Home Entertainment and Blockbuster Video issued a commemorative edition in 1995. Anchor Bay Entertainment (succeder in-interest to Media Home Entertainment and Video Treasures) has released several restored editions of "Halloween" on VHS and DVD, including "Halloween: Unmasked" a documentary produced and directed by Mark Cerulli which featured an array of interviews with original Halloween cast & crew including Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Hill, John Carpenter, Nick Castle and others. The most recent being the 2007 single-disc restored version, with improved picture and sound quality. Anchor Bay has also released an "extended edition" of "Halloween" that features the original theatrical release with the scenes that were shot for the broadcast TV version edited in at their proper places. In 2003, the film was released on a two-disc "25th Anniversary edition" with improved DiviMax picture and audio, along with an audio commentary by John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis and Debra Hill, the "A Cut Above The Rest" documentary, "On Location: 25 Years Later" featurette, the trailer, TV spots, radio spots, poster and still gallery, and DVD-ROM content. In 2007, the movie was released on Blu-ray as well, marking the film's first ever Blu-ray release. The Blu-ray features a commentary track by Carpenter, Hill and Curtis, the trailer, TV spots, radio spots, fast film facts and the documentary "Halloween: A Cut Above the Rest". In 2008, a "30th Anniversary commemorative set" was released, containing the film on DVD and Blu-ray along with the "extended edition", the first disc from the "25 Years of Terror" documentary DVD and two of its sequels: ' and ', including a collectible replica Michael Myers mask. The DVD release was THX certified. The film has made $18,500,000 in home video rentals.
On June 6, 2013, it was announced that a second, 35th anniversary, Blu-ray release for "Halloween" is in the works and that John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis have recorded a new commentary. On June 11, it was announced that Dean Cundey is supervising a new high-definition transfer. On July 22, the official cover art for the 35th anniversary Blu-ray release was revealed including the new special features such as the all-new high definition transfer by Cundey, the new commentary track by Carpenter and Curtis as well as a new 7.1 audio mix, the original mono audio mix, a new featurette with Curtis titled "The Night She Came Home", an "On-Location" featurette, the trailer, television and radio spots and the additional scenes from the extended television version.
Reception.
Critical reception.
Critical response to the film was mostly positive. Although "Halloween" performed well with little advertising — relying mostly on word-of-mouth — many critics seemed uninterested or dismissive of the film. Pauline Kael wrote a scathing review in "The New Yorker" suggesting that "Carpenter doesn't seem to have had any life outside the movies: one can trace almost every idea on the screen to directors such as Hitchcock and Brian De Palma and to the Val Lewton productions" and claiming that "Maybe when a horror film is stripped of everything but dumb scariness — when it isn't ashamed to revive the stalest device of the genre (the escaped lunatic) — it satisfies part of the audience in a more basic, childish way than sophisticated horror pictures do." The first glowing review by a prominent film critic came from Tom Allen of "The Village Voice" in November 1978, Allen noted that the film was sociologically irrelevant but applauded Carpenter's camera work as "duplicitous hype" and "the most honest way to make a good schlock film". Allen pointed out the stylistic similarities to "Psycho" and George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). The following month, "Voice" lead critic Andrew Sarris wrote a follow-up feature on cult films, citing Allen's appraisal of "Halloween" and saying in the lead sentence that the film "bids fair to become the cult discovery of 1978. Audiences have been heard screaming at its horrifying climaxes". Renowned American critic Roger Ebert gave the film similar praise in his 1979 review in the "Chicago Sun-Times", and selected it as one of his top ten films of 1978. Once-dismissive critics were impressed by Carpenter's choice of camera angles and simple music, and surprised by the lack of blood, gore, and graphic violence. Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports 94% of critics gave the film positive write-ups based on 49 reviews, with a rating of 8.5 out of 10 with the general consensus reading ""Scary, suspenseful, and viscerally thrilling, Halloween set the standard for modern horror films"."
Many compared the film with the work of Alfred Hitchcock, although "TV Guide" calls comparisons made to "Psycho" "silly and groundless" and critics in the late 1980s and early 1990s blame the film for spawning the slasher sub genre, which they felt had rapidly descended into sadism and misogyny. Almost a decade after its premiere, Mick Martin and Marsha Porter critiqued the first-person camera shots that earlier film reviewers had praised and later slasher-film directors utilized for their own films (for example, "Friday the 13th" (1980)). Claiming it encouraged audience identification with the killer, Martin and Porter pointed to the way "the camera moves in on the screaming, pleading, victim, 'looks down' at the knife, and then plunges it into chest, ear, or eyeball. Now that's sick."
More than 35 years after its debut, "Halloween" enjoys a reputation as a classic and is considered by many as one of the best films of 1978.
Themes and analysis.
Many criticisms of "Halloween" and other slasher films come from postmodern academia. Some feminist critics, according to historian Nicholas Rogers, "have seen the slasher movies since "Halloween" as debasing women in as decisive a manner as hard-core pornography." Critics such as John Kenneth Muir state that female characters such as Laurie Strode survive not because of "any good planning" or their own resourcefulness, but sheer luck. Although she manages to repel the killer several times, in the end, Strode is rescued in "Halloween" and "Halloween II" only when Dr. Loomis arrives to shoot Myers.
On the other hand, other feminist scholars such as Carol J. Clover argue that despite the violence against women, slasher films turned women into heroines. In many pre-"Halloween" horror films, women are depicted as helpless victims and are not safe until they are rescued by a strong masculine hero. Despite the fact that Loomis saves Strode, Clover asserts that "Halloween" initiates the role of the "final girl" who ultimately triumphs in the end. Strode herself fought back against Myers and severely wounds him. Had Myers been a normal man, Strode's attacks would have killed him; even Loomis, the male hero of the story, who shoots Michael repeatedly at near point blank range with a large caliber handgun, cannot kill him.
Aviva Briefel argued that moments such as when Michael loses his mask are meant to give pleasure to the male viewer. Briefel further argues that these moments are masochistic in nature and give pleasure to men because they are willingly submitting themselves to the women of the film; they submit themselves temporarily because it will make their return to authority even more powerful. Critics, such as Pat Gill, see "Halloween" as a critique of American social values. She remarks that parental figures are almost entirely absent throughout the film, noting that when Laurie is attacked by Michael while babysitting, "No parents, either of the teenagers or of the children left in their charge, call to check on their children or arrive to keen over them."
Another major theme found in the film is the dangers of pre-marital sex. Clover believes that killers in slasher films are fueled by a "psychosexual fury" and that all the killings are sexual in nature. She reinforces this idea by saying that "guns have no place in slasher films" and when examining the film "I Spit on Your Grave" she notes that "a hands-on killing answers a hands-on rape in a way that a shooting, even a shooting preceded by a humiliation, does not." Equating sex with violence is important in "Halloween" and the slasher genre according to Pat Gill, who made a note of this in her essay "The Monstrous Years: Teens, Slasher Films, and the Family". She remarks that Laurie's friends "think of their babysitting jobs as opportunities to share drinks and beds with their boyfriends. One by one they are killed... by Michael Myers an asylum escapee who years ago at the age of six murdered his sister for preferring sex to taking care of him."
The danger of suburbia is another major theme that runs throughout the movie and the slasher genre itself, Pat Gill states that slasher films "seem to mock white flight to gated communities, in particular the attempts of parents to shield their children from the dangerous influences represented by the city". "Halloween" and slasher films, generally, are supposed to represent the underside of suburbia. Michael Myers was raised in a suburban household and after he escapes the mental hospital he returns to his hometown to kill again; Myers is a product of the suburban environment.
Carpenter himself dismisses the notion that "Halloween" is a morality play, regarding it as merely a horror movie. According to Carpenter, critics "completely missed the point there". He explains, "The one girl who is the most sexually uptight just keeps stabbing this guy with a long knife. She's the most sexually frustrated. She's the one that's killed him. Not because she's a virgin but because all that sexually repressed energy starts coming out. She uses all those phallic symbols on the guy."
Awards.
"Halloween" was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films in 1979, but lost to "The Wicker Man" (1973). In 2001, "Halloween" ranked #68 on the American Film Institute TV program "100 Years...100 Thrills". The film was #14 on Bravo's "The 100 Scariest Movie Moments" (2004). Similarly, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 3rd scariest film ever made. In 2006, "Halloween" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". In 2007, the AOL 31 Days of Horror countdown named "Halloween" the greatest horror movie. In 2008, the film was selected by "Empire" magazine as one of "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time". In 2010, "Total Film" selected the film as one of "The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time".
American Film Institute lists
Influence.
"Halloween" is a widely influential film within the horror genre; it was largely responsible for the popularization of slasher films in the 1980s. "Halloween" popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. "Halloween" helped to popularize the final girl trope, the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous, and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that "Halloween" is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s. Due to its popularity, "Halloween" became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as "Friday the 13th" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street", would follow.
The major themes present in "Halloween" would also become common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in "Halloween", there is a theme of absentee parents but films such as "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Friday the 13th" feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.
There are slasher films that predated "Halloween", such as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" and "Black Christmas" which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well having the final girl trope. "Halloween", however, is seen by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others.
The 1981 horror film spoof "Student Bodies" parodied these plot devices; characters are slain when about to engage in sex. Another slasher film with a twist was the 1986 film "April Fool's Day". Director Wes Craven's 1996 film "Scream" and its three sequels detail the "rules" for surviving a horror film, even using "Halloween" as the primary example: no sex, no alcohol or illicit drugs, and never say "I'll be right back".
Adaptations.
Richard Curtis, under the pen name Curtis Richards, penned a mass market paperback novelization of the same name which was published by Bantam Books in 1979. It was reissued in 1982; it later went out of print. The novel elaborates on aspects not featured in the film such as the origins of the curse of Samhain and Michael Myers's life in Smith's Grove Sanitarium. For example, the opening reads:The horror started on the eve of Samhain, in a foggy vale in northern Ireland, at the dawn of the Celtic race. And once started, it trod the earth forevermore, wreaking its savagery suddenly, swiftly, and with incredible ferocity.
In 1983, "Halloween" was adapted as a video game for the Atari 2600 by Wizard Video. None of the main characters in the game were named. Players take on the role of a teenage babysitter who tries to save as many children from an unnamed, knife-wielding killer as possible. The game was not popular with parents or players and the graphics were simple, as was typical in Atari 2600 games. In another effort to save money, most versions of the game did not even have a label on the cartridge. It was simply a piece of tape with "Halloween" written in marker. The game contained more gore than the film, however. When the babysitter is killed, her head disappears and is replaced by blood pulsating from the neck. The game's primary similarity to the film is the theme music that plays when the killer appears onscreen.
Sequels and remake.
"Halloween" spawned seven sequels, a 2007 remake of the same name directed by Rob Zombie — and a 2009 sequel to the remake, "Halloween II", which is unrelated to the sequel of the original. Of these films, only "Halloween II" (1981) was written by Carpenter and Hill. It begins exactly where "Halloween" ends and was intended to finish the story of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. "Halloween II" was hugely successful, becoming the highest grossing horror film of 1981. It was also the most critically acclaimed sequel in the series. Carpenter did not direct any of the subsequent films in the "Halloween" series, although he did produce "" (1982), the plot of which is unrelated to the other films in the series. He also composed the music for the second and third films, along with Alan Howarth.
After the negative critical reception for "Season of the Witch", the filmmakers brought back Michael Myers in "".
The sequels feature more explicit violence and gore, and are generally dismissed by mainstream film critics. They were filmed on larger budgets than the original: In contrast to "Halloween"s modest budget of $320,000, "Halloween II"s budget was around $2.5 million, while the final sequel to the original, "" (2002), boasted a budget of $15 million. Financier Moustapha Akkad continued to work closely with the "Halloween" franchise, acting as executive producer of every sequel until his death in the 2005 Amman bombings.
With the exception of "Halloween III", the sequels further develop the character of Michael Myers and the Samhain theme. Even without considering the third film, the "Halloween" series contains continuity issues, which some sources attribute to the different writers and directors involved in each film. The 10 "Halloween" films, including the 2007 remake and its sequel, have had eight directors. Only Rick Rosenthal and Rob Zombie directed more than one: Rosenthal directed "Halloween II" and "", while Zombie directed the remake and its sequel.

Range accrual

In finance, a range accrual is a type of derivative product very popular among structured-note investors. It is estimated that more than USD 160 billions of Range Accrual indexed on interest rates only have been sold to investors since 2004. It is one of the most popular non-vanilla financial derivatives. In essence the investor in a range accrual is betting that interest rates will stay within a predefined range.
Payoff description.
A general expression for the payoff of a range accrual is:
If the observation frequency is daily, the payoff could be more easily written as
where
The index could be an interest rate (e.g. USD 3 months Libor), or a FX rate (e.g. EUR/USD) or a commodity (e.g. oil price) or any other observable financial index.
The observation period can be different from daily (e.g. weekly, monthly,etc.), though a daily observation is the most encountered.
The receiver of the range accrual coupons is selling binary options. The value of these options is used to enhance the coupon paid.
Example.
Let's take an example of a 5 years range accrual note linked to USD 3 months Libor, with range set as [1.00%; 6.00%] and a conditional coupon of 5.00%. Let's assume the note to start on January 1, 2009 and the first coupon payment to happen on July 1, 2009.
An investor who buys USD 100m of this note will have the following cash flows:
1.00% and 6.00% for 130 days, then the rate applied for the first semester will be:
Different types of range accruals.
The payout ("P" in our notation), for each day the index is in the range, could be either a fix or variable rate.
Valuation and risks.
A range accrual can be seen as a strip of binary options, with a decreasing lag between fixing date and payment date. For this reason, it is important the valuation model is well calibrated to the volatility term structure of the underlying, at least at the strikes implied by the range.
If furthermore the range accrual is callable, then the valuation model also needs to take into account the dynamic between the swaption and the underlying.
Accrual swaps that monitor permanence of interest rates into a range and pay a related interest rate times the permanence factor also depend on correlation across different adjacent forward rates. For the details see for example Brigo and Mercurio (2001).

RMIT Music

RMIT Music is the collective representing all student run musical groups at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia
RMIT Music was created in 2004 following the merger of the Concert Band Collective, Stage Band Collective and the RMIT Occasional Choral Society and currently is the largest collective within RMIT Link Arts and currently consists of nine bands including a Choir and an Orchestra. RMIT Music is located in the "Music Room", building 57, level 4, room 1 at the RMIT City campus. RMIT University does not offer a music instrument degree, so everyone in the RMIT community is welcome to join.
RMIT Music's Bands.
RMIT Symphonic Orchestra.
The RMIT Symphonic Orchestra (RSO) was founded in Semester 2 of 2008 by the RMIT Music Collective Committee. It currently exists only as a small 25 member orchestra however is expected to grow larger over time. The RSO is made up of students from all colleges of RMIT and auditions are usually not required to join. Rehearsals are on Tuesday Evenings during the University Semester. The RSO had its Premiere performance at the 2008 RMIT Music End of Year Showcase performing the Tatarian Dances music suite.
RMIT Occasional Choral Society.
The RMIT Occasional Choral Society (ROCS) was founded in 1999 by RMIT Music's sole Life Member, Sandra Uitdenbogerd, and is the longest-running of the RMIT Music collectives. ROCS is RMIT's student run choir and is strongly affiliated with other Australian university choral societies as a full member of AICSA. From its inception, ROCS has maintained a tradition of performing and commissioning new choral works, often composed by members of the choir, and in 2007 ROCS sponsored a composition competition open to university choristers throughout Australia.
Now in its tenth full year, ROCS is no longer 'occasional', and rehearsals occur throughout the year, mainly on Thursday evenings. ROCS usually performs two or three major concerts a year, in addition to participation with the other RMIT Music collectives in the Showcase concerts, and has frequently collaborated with other choirs and orchestras. ROCS' musical director and chief conductor is Philip Legge, who since 2006 has programmed major works by Monteverdi, Purcell, Bach, Mozart, Schubert, Orff and Stravinsky.
ROCS is non-auditioned and all you need to join is a love of music, a willingness to learn, and the dedication to attend a regular rehearsal schedule. ROCS is a strongly social choir, and choir members are active participants in the yearly Intervarsity Choral Festivals, held in turn in each of Australia's major capital cities (excepting Darwin). With the Melbourne and Monash University choirs, ROCS jointly hosted the most recent festival held in Melbourne, in 2005.
RMIT Concert Band.
The RMIT Concert Band was the first non-choral band formed as part of RMIT Union Arts and is stronger than ever today. The Concert Band is a non-auditioned band that rehearses on Monday Evenings during the University semester. The RMIT Concert Band hosts the annual RMIT Music Regional Tours, where bands travel to regional Victoria and perform in the local community. The Concert Band has visited the Mornington Peninsula, Woodend, Ballarat, Moe and Orbost. The RMIT Concert Band also performs yearly at the Carols By Candlelight in Moe with the Latrobe Community Concert Band. The Concert Band is Conducted by Trent Howard.
RMIT Stage Band.

RMIT String Ensemble.
The String Ensemble is made up of string performers who may or may not also be members of the RMIT Symphonic Orchestra. The Ensemble was formed in 2005 as a quartet, before becoming a Chamber Ensemble to a full String Ensemble as it is today.
Small Ensembles.
RMIT Music allows musicians to form their own small ensembles. Currently there is a Flute Ensemble, a Recorder Ensemble and a Cello Ensemble.
The Gap Fillers Flute Ensemble was created in 2007 to fill a gap in the program of the 2007 RMIT Music End of Year Showcase concert, thus they became known as "The Gap Fillers". In Semester Two, 2008 the Gap Fillers started rehearsing weekly, purchasing music and is now a permanent group within RMIT Music, with regular rehearsals and concerts.
The Recorder Consort is a recently created RMIT Music band, started in Semester Two, 2008 this group is for people who play the recorders of all sizes. The band currently has over ten members and rehearses throughout the Summer holidays.

Sykehouse railway station was a railway station built on the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway between Thorpe-in-Balne and Snaith and Pollington. It was built with the line which opened on 1 May 1916 but the station never opened to passengers. Although there were no passengers, the station was on the edge of the village of Sykehouse some distance from the village, it had facilities and the two flanking platforms were in situ until 1960. 
The station was controlled by a signal box situated by the level crossing at the end of the platform and this lasted until final closure of the line.

4th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment

4th (County Fermanagh) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment (4 UDR) was formed in 1970 as part of the 7 original battalions specified in The Ulster Defence Regiment Act 1969, which received Royal Assent on 18 December 1969 and was brought into force on 1 January 1970. It was amalgamated with the 6th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment in 1992 to form the 4th/6th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment.
History.
Along with the other 6 original battalions, 4 UDR commenced operational duties on 1 April 1970.
The first training Major (TISO) was Major KW Battison Royal Welsh Fusiliers. Part of his job was to find accommodation for the various companies of the new battalion. Where possible accommodation was sought in army bases although the old Ulster Special Constabulary platoon huts were vacant and available. To have used those would have attracted criticism from those who were already claiming that the UDR was the B Specials under a new name.
The battalion was initially based in the ladies rest room of the territorial army centre in Enniskillen but was moved to Grosvenor Barracks, Coleshill, Enniskillen where a new "hardened" barracks was eventually built, partially underground, to withstand mortar attack. The modified barracks was opened by the Duke of Westminster in 1991 (Grosvenor being the family name of the Duke. He has long standing family and military connections with the area).
Most patrols from of Grosvenor Barracks went out by helicopter or boat. Because of the danger of ambush vehicles were only used in the urban area around Enniskillen. The county is surrounded on three sides by the Republic of Ireland. Boat patrols were common as the county contains upper and lower Lough Erne. The battalion performed this task when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made her last visit to the area just several days before her resignation.

Intimidation.
Protestant and Catholic soldiers were both intimidated out of the regiment. Following the introduction of internment however more Catholic soldiers found themselves the subject of intimidation from within their own community. In Enniskillen one member of the conrate guard was Catholic. Some of his neighbours came to his home in the early hours of the morning and beat him as well as scrubbing his face with a hard brush. He was a frail man but was beaten black and blue and his face badly damaged by the brush. He resigned from the battalion the next day.

5th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment

5th (County Londonderry) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment (5 UDR) was formed in 1970 as part of the 7 original battalions specified in The Ulster Defence Regiment Act 1969, which received Royal Assent on 18 December 1969 and was brought into force on 1 January 1970. It was, along with the rest of the regiment, amalgamated with the Royal Irish Rangers in 1992 to form the Royal Irish Regiment.
Recruitment.
Recruitment for 5 UDR was initially slow. The battalion began its duties on 1 April 1970 with only 200 men to patrol Derry city and a further 300 to cover the rest of the county as opposed to the USC's figures for the previous day of 600 and 1200 respectively. Catholic recruitment was on a par with Protestant figures however and the two city companies of 5 UDR were 50/50 in makeup, with John Hume known to have signed at least one application and told the recruit to "go out and find all the decent Catholic people he could to enlist".
Sir Robin Chichester-Clark complained asked in parliament why one of his constituents was turned down for the force as he was a churchwarden and a local government official. The reply by Roy Hattersley confirmed that the vetting team had been instructed to err on the side of caution and that two clergymen had also been refused because the new force was to be "isolated from political and sectarian influence".
Intimidation.
Protestant and Catholic soldiers were both intimidated out of the regiment. Following the introduction of internment however more Catholic soldiers found themselves the subject of intimidation from within their own community. One captain in 5 UDR, who had been a member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and had taken part in the Derry march, was intimidated out of the regiment, out of his job and out of Derry.
The OC of the Waterside Company commented that it was "very, very soul destroying" to lose good men this way, especially when they so obviously enjoyed being soldiers in the regiment.
History.
Along with the other 6 original battalions, 5 UDR commenced operational duties on 1 April 1970. Battalion Headquarters was established at the former Anti-submarine warfare school but was later moved to more suitable accommodation in Shackleton Barracks, Ballykelly, County Londonderry which they shared at various times with the Royal Air Force, the Army Air Corps and various units of the army.
The battalion had the largest Tactical Area of Responsibility in the regiment which covered parts of two counties (Londonderry and Antrim) as well as three police divisions. 1600 miles in total.
The first commanding officer of 5 UDR was Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Bulstrode Lloyd Davidson JP, MID who had seen action in World War 2 as an officer with the 2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Appointed Deputy Lord Lieutenant, High Sheriff for County Londonderry and later, Commandant of the City of Derry Ulster Special Constabulary between 1968 and 1970.
Following his retirement after his agreed one year of service he was replaced by the battalion's first regular commanding officer, Lt Col John Lys.
The second in command (2 i/c) of the battalion upon formation was Major George Lapsley, the son of a police inspector, graduate of Magee College, World War 2 veteran of the Royal Navy (Far Eastern campaign), and officer of the Territorial Army. He was responsible for recruitment in the early stages. The job of 2 i/c was usually given to the senior part-time officer of the battalion until 1991 when the post was changed to one for a regular officer.
The first Training Major (TISO) was Major LSTH Pelham-Burn of the Coldstream Guards. Part of his job was to organise accommodation for all the companies of the new battalion. Where possible accommodation was sought in army bases although the old Ulster Special Constabulary platoon huts were vacant and available. To have used those would have attracted criticism from those who were already claiming that the UDR was the B Specials under a new name.
Companies.
The battalion eventually had seven Rifle Companies which were based at: Ebrington Barracks, Derry, (A, West Bank, Coy and B, Waterside Coy), C Coy in Claudy, D Coy in Shackleton Barracks, Ballykelly, E Coy at Laurel House, Coleraine, F Coy in Magherafelt. and G Coy in Maghera.
G Coy was originally the B Coy of 1 UDR based in Ballymoney. It came under the command of 5 UDR in 1983. A further change in 1992 saw E and G Coys merge to form D Company.
E Company.
Raised in 1971 the first Officer Commanding E Company (E Coy) was Major George Lapsley who transferred in from Battalion Headquarters.
The company was broken down into four platoons. The majority of soldiers in 21 Platoon came from Portrush, Portstewart (the Ports) and the Windyhall area of Coleraine. 22 Platoon's soldiers lived on the east side of the River Bann. 23 Platoon's men and women came from the west side of the Bann, known as "The Heights" whilst 24 Platoon recruited from Garvagh and surrounding areas. The resulting platoon structure had soldiers from each area regular patrolling territory they were familiar with and where they knew most people from the locality. This was a hallmark of the early UDR part-timers: that they were able to tell when something was amiss in the areas they knew when out on patrol.
Company headquarters was established in the former USC Drill Hall in Macosquin. After discussion with a local property owner "Laurel Hill House", built in 1843, was purchased by the Army Property Services Department for £24,000 but required work in excess of £100,000 to make it fit for purpose. The house had been military accommodation in the past when it was requisitioned for the United States Army in World War 2. It was also reputed to be haunted.
By the time E Company took possession of the house and outbuilding they had been converted into a barracks which contained all the facilities expected to be found in UDR company and battalion locations. A guardroom, armoury, Motor Transport (MT) section, 25 metre indoor rifle range (for .22 Long Rifle .22 calibre only), Officer's Mess, Warrant Officers and Sergeant's Mess, Junior Ranks Bar, snooker reoom, stores, lecture rooms, offices, operations room, sangars and a pipe range. A pipe range consists of a 30 metre section of concrete pipe of 1 metre diameter, set onto the ground and covered substantially with earth. It was used in military bases in Northern Ireland for rifle practice when surrounding buildings made it unsafe to establish an open shooting range.
A helicopter pad was also established in the grounds of the house and a drill hall built close by. The drill hall also doubled as a room for large functions.
The house and 4.5 acres of grounds were placed on the market again in 2012 and sold at auction for an undisclosed sum although the guide price was listed at £190,000.
Uniform, armament & equipment.
Initially arms had to be drawn from the North Irish Horse barracks in Ballymoney which by that time had become B Coy 1 UDR
See also: Ulster Defence Regiment Uniform, armament & equipment
Music.
5 UDR had a number of champion pipers and drummers who, apart from local performances, represented the regiment at Horse Guards Parade the Festival of Remembrance in the Royal Albert Hall, London, the Colchester Tattoo, the Queen's Birthday Celebrations in York, an International Air Show at Aldergove and on a tour of the British Army of the Rhine.
In the World Pipe Band Championships of 1978 the pipes and drums of 5 UDR won the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association championship against 126 entrants. In the World Pipe Band Championships of 1979 competing against 260 other bands, they won both the "Piping and Marching" and "Discipline" trophies. Improving on their 1978 placings of 2nd and 1st respectively in those categories.
The album 5 UDR Pipes & Drums "Irish & Scottish Pipe Music", which includes recordings of the regimental and battalions marches as well as other popular tunes, was the only recording publicly released by regimental musicians.
Casualties.
28 soldiers from 5 UDR died whilst on active duty during The Troubles, a further 12 were assassinated after completing their service.
The first to die was Captain Marcus McCausland, a Catholic. Captain McCausland had previously served with the Irish Guards. His family owned a large estate outside Limavady. He had served as High sheriff for the county and was also a member of the Urban District Council. The Official Irish Republican Army abducted him and interrogated him for four hours before shooting him and dumping his body in the snow.
Sgt David C. Deacon, Age 38, (HQ Company), 3 March 1973. His hooded body was found near Londonderry, his hands were tied behind his back, and he had been tortured. Sgt Deacon had previous service in the Royal Navy and was married with four children and was off duty at the time of his abduction and death. Eight years after his death his wife and four other UDR and RUC Widows formed The Widow's Mite to tell the world their side of the story and to counter IRA propaganda. She had her gold wedding right melted down and recast as the ancient "mite" bearing the symbol of a lighted candle.
Memorials.
A number of memorials exist to the fallen of the 5th Battalion. The main memorial to the UDR was erected in Lisburn, unveiled on 12 June 2011 by Viscount Brookeborough, one of the trustees of the UDR Memorial Trust.
The Memorial is "a 19-foot 'heroic scale' bronze sculpture" featuring "bronze figures of a male UDR soldier and a female ‘Greenfinch’ on operational duty...set upon an equally impressive Mourne granite plinth.".

The 6th (County Tyrone) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment (6 UDR) was formed in 1970 as part of the 7 original battalions specified in The Ulster Defence Regiment Act 1969, which received Royal Assent on 18 December 1969 and was brought into force on 1 January 1970. It was, along with the rest of the regiment, amalgamated with the Royal Irish Rangers in 1992 to form the Royal Irish Regiment.
History.
Along with the other 6 original battalions, 6 UDR commenced operational duties on 1 April 1970.
Around 75% (1187) of the men of the Tyrone B Specials applied to join 6 UDR of which 419 were accepted. As a result, the battalion started life as the only battalion more or less up to strength and remained so during its history.
The first training major (TISO) was Major GB Hill, MBE, King's Own Borderers. He was located in the Education Building at Lisanelly Barracks, Omagh. Part of his job was to find accommodation for the various companies of the new battalion. Where possible accommodation was sought in army bases although the old Ulster Special Constabulary platoon huts were vacant and available. To have used those would have attracted criticism from those who were already claiming that the UDR was the B Specials under a new name.
For a time an old caravan in the centre of Dungannon served as the local UDR post and ten rifles along with 200 rounds of ammunition were stored there.
Companies.
C Company and The Deanery.
The Deanery was an 18th-century mansion in Clogher, County Tyrone. It had been the home of Jonathan Swift, the author of Gulliver's Travels and was one of fifteen old large houses taken over by the MOD to house the UDR. After persuading the old lady who lived there to move to less spartan accommodation £150,000 was spent on the property to turn it into a base for C Company. The house has now been demolished.
Intimidation.
Protestant and Catholic soldiers were both intimidated out of the regiment. Following the introduction of internment however more Catholic soldiers found themselves the subject of intimidation from within their own community. In Clady a soldier who had been in the regiment for only three weeks had his front door daubed with the words "Get out of the UDR or be shot - IRA". Two weeks later as he, his wife and their five children were asleep a shotgun was fired at their home shattering several windows.
Casualties.
During the general mobilisation for Operation Demetrius a patrol from the battalion came under fire from the Provisional IRA near Clady, County Tyrone. Private Winston Donnell, age 22, one of four brothers serving in the regiment, was killed outright. He was the first UDR soldier to be killed.
Sgt Kenneth Smyth Age 28, (B. Company), a former B Special, was killed on 10 December 1971 along with ex Pte Daniel McCormick (a Catholic), who had recently resigned from the Regiment. Sgt Smyth had survived a previous attempt to kill him. 
Private William Bogle, age 27, (B Company) was killed as he sat in his car with his wife and children on 5 December 1972. His killer was believed to be a former member of the same company, known for his strong republican views, who resigned from the UDR after just one year. He moved to the Republic of Ireland after the shooting and never came back.
Private Eva Martin, age 28, (C Company) was fatally wounded by rocket fragments on 3 May 1974 during a PIRA attack on 6 UDR's outlying base at the Deanery, Clogher. She was not only the first Greenfinch to be killed in action but also the first female member of the security forces to die in the Troubles. Her husband, Lieutenant Martin was on duty with her when she was killed. Private Martin was Laid to rest at Lisbellaw Presbyterian Church, County Fermanagh.
On 13 July 1983, Ronald Alexander (19), John Roxborough (19), Oswald Neely (20) and Thomas Harron (25), all members of D Company, were killed in a Provisional Irish Republican Army land mine attack on their mobile patrol on Ballymackilroy Hill, near Ballygawley.

The first training major (TISO - training intelligence and security officer) was Major RW Wilson, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, who took up his appointment at Palace Barracks, Holywood just outside Belfast. Part of his job was to find accommodation for the various companies of the new battalion. Where possible accommodation was sought in army bases although the old Ulster Special Constabulary platoon huts were vacant and available. To have used those would have attracted criticism from those who were already claiming that the UDR was the B Specials under a new name.
Recruitment.
The appointment of Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) was carried out in a variety of ways. In most cases men were selected who had previously held non commissioned rank in any of the armed forces or the USC. The filling of senior NCO posts in this manner did have a drawback in that many men of comparatively young ages who had considerable years of service before retirement or promotion created a "promotion block"
Intimidation.
Protestant and Catholic soldiers were both intimidated out of the regiment. Following the introduction of internment however more Catholic soldiers found themselves the subject of intimidation from within their own community.

Casualties.
The first soldier from the battalion to be killed was Private Sean Russell, aged 30 (D Company) who was killed as he sat at home with his wife and five children in the predominantly Catholic New Barnsley estate in Belfast. Private Russell was also the first Catholic UDR soldier to be killed by the Provisional IRA. Following his death 40 Catholics resigned from the regiment.

Ghost World (film)

Ghost World is a 2001 American comedy-drama film directed by Terry Zwigoff, based on the comic book of the same name and screenplay by Daniel Clowes. The story focuses on the lives of Enid and Rebecca, two teenage outsiders in an unnamed American city. The film was released with limited box-office success but has since gained a cult following.
Plot.
Best friends Enid and Rebecca face summer after their high-school graduation. The girls are both social outcasts, but Rebecca is more popular with boys than Enid. Enid's diploma is awarded on the condition that she attend a remedial art class. Even though she is a talented artist, her art teacher, Roberta, believes art must be socially meaningful and dismisses Enid's sketches as "light entertainment."
The girls see a personal ad in which a lonely man named Seymour asks a woman he met recently to contact him. Enid makes a prank phone call to Seymour, pretending to be the woman and inviting him to meet her at a diner, and when he goes there, the two girls secretly watch and make fun of him. However, Enid begins to feel sorry for him, so a few days later they follow him to his apartment building, where they find him selling vintage records in a garage sale. Enid buys an old blues album from him, and they gradually become friends. She tries to find women for him to date. Meanwhile, Enid has been attending her art class. In order to please Roberta, Enid persuades Seymour to lend her an old poster depicting a grotesquely caricatured black man, which was once used as a promotional tool by Coon Chicken Inn, the fried-chicken franchise where Seymour holds a management position. In class, she presents the poster as a social comment about racism, and Roberta is so impressed with the concept that she later offers Enid a scholarship to an art college.
At this point, Enid's and Becky's lives seriously diverge. While Enid has been spending time with Seymour, Becky has found a job and become more interested in clothing, boys, and other material things. Enid finds a job so the girls can rent an apartment together, but she is fired after only one day. Finally, Becky gives up looking for an apartment with Enid after their personal differences erupt into an angry argument. Sometime after Enid loses her job, Seymour receives a phone call from Dana, the woman he had written to in the personal ad. Enid encourages him to develop a relationship with Dana, but becomes jealous when he begins avoiding Enid to spend time with Dana. At the end of the summer, Enid's and Seymour's lives fall apart. When Enid's poster is displayed in an art show, school officials find it so offensive they force Roberta to give her a failing grade; when Enid discovers she has lost her scholarship, she visits Seymour for solace, resulting in a drunken one-night stand. Seymour then breaks up with Dana before realizing he has no chance with Enid, and loses his job after the poster is displayed in a newspaper. Becky tells Seymour about Enid's phone prank, and he is hospitalized after attacking a boy who was with the girls at the time.
Finally, Enid gives in to her childhood fantasy of running away from home. She sees an old man named Norman, who was waiting at an out-of-service bus stop for days on end, finally board a bus that arrives at his bench. The next day, while Seymour discusses the summer's events with his therapist, Enid goes to the bench and gets on the bus when it arrives.
Release.
"Ghost World" premiered on June 16, 2001 at the Seattle International Film Festival, to lower than average recognition by audiences, but admiration from critics. It was also screened at several film festivals all over the world including the Fantasia Festival in Montreal.
With a limited commercial theatrical run in the United States, "Ghost World"’s commercial success was minimal. The film was released on July 20, 2001 in five theaters grossing $98,791 on its opening weekend; it slowly expanded to more theaters, reaching a maximum of 128 by September. It went on to make $6.2 million in North America and $2.5 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $8.7 million, just above its $7 million budget.
Critical reaction.
The film's critical reception has been highly positive; it currently has a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 88 metascore on Metacritic. Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, "I wanted to hug this movie. It takes such a risky journey and never steps wrong. It creates specific, original, believable, lovable characters, and meanders with them through their inconsolable days, never losing its sense of humor." In his review for "The New York Times", A. O. Scott praised Thora Birch's performance: "Thora Birch, whose performance as Lester Burnham's alienated daughter was the best thing about "American Beauty", plays a similar character here, with even more intelligence and restraint." Kevin Thomas, in his review for "The Los Angeles Times", wrote, "Buscemi rarely has had so full and challenging a role, that of a mature, reflective man, unhandsome yet not unattractive, thanks to a witty sensitivity and clear intelligence." In his "Chicago Reader" review, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, "Birch makes the character an uncanny encapsulation of adolescent agonies without ever romanticizing or sentimentalizing her attitudes, and Clowes and Zwigoff never allow us to patronize her." "Time" magazine's Andrew D. Arnold wrote, "Unlike those shrill, hard-sell teen comedies on the other screens, "Ghost World" never becomes the kind of empty, defensive snark-fest that it targets. Clowes and Zwigoff keep the organic pace of the original, and its empathic exploration of painfully changing relationships."
Michael Dean of "The Comics Journal" said, "Those with higher expectations - and, certainly, "Ghost World" purists - are likely to experience at least a degree of disappointment. Some of the comic's air of aimless mystery has been paved over with the semblance of a Hollywood plot, and to that extent, the movie is a lesser work than the comic. But it's still a far better movie than we had a right to expect." According to Dean:
It's ultimately a testament to Clowes' original creations that so much of Enid and Becky shines through all the tampering and compromises. And it's a testament to Zwigoff that he was able to keep the film as quiet and understated as it is and draw first-rate performances from his primary cast...The injection of a relatively trite plot situation into "Ghost World"s more enigmatic stream of events is perhaps forgivable, since the film might otherwise never have been produced. Its greatest sin, the misappropriation of Enid's longing, is not so forgivable, though the overlap between Zwigoff's distaste for modernity and Enid's distrust of social acceptability makes it almost palatable. In any case, we want to forgive it, because so much is right about the movie.
"Entertainment Weekly" gave the film an "A-" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, ""Ghost World" is a movie for anyone who ever felt imprisoned by life but crazy about it anyway." In her review for the "LA Weekly", Manohla Dargis wrote, "If Zwigoff doesn't always make his movie move (he's overly faithful to the concept of the cartoon panel), he has a gift for connecting us to people who aren't obviously likable, then making us see the urgency of that connection." In "Sight & Sound", Leslie Felperin wrote, "Cannily, the main performers deliver most of their lines in slack monotones, all the better to set off the script's wit and balance the glistering cluster of varyingly deranged lesser characters." In his review for "The Guardian", Peter Bradshaw wrote, "It is an engaging account of the raw pain of adolescence: the fear of being trapped in a grown-up future and choosing the wrong grown-up identity, and of course the pain of love, which we all learn to anaesthetise with jobs and mundane worries."
However, in his review for "The New York Observer", Andrew Sarris disliked the character of Enid: "I found Enid smug, complacent, cruel, deceitful, thoughtless, malicious and disloyal. Worst of all, she's rarely funny and never charming ... Enid's favorite targets are people who are older, poorer or dumber than she is, which is to say that the California wasteland fashioned by Mr. Zwigoff and Mr. Clowes seems made up almost entirely of stooges for Enid and Rebecca to tease and taunt."
Legacy.
"Ghost World" topped MSN Movies' list of the "Top 10 Comic Book Movies", it was ranked number 3 out of 94 in Rotten Tomatoes' "Comix Worst to Best" countdown (where #1 was the best and #94 the worst), ranked 5th "Best" on IGN's "Best & Worst Comic-Book Movies", and "Empire" magazine ranked the film 19th in their "The 20 Greatest Comic Book Movies" list.
Soundtrack.
Music in the film includes "Jaan Pehechan Ho" by Mohammed Rafi, a dance number from the 1965 Bollywood musical "Gumnaam" (which Enid watches and dances to early in the film), and "Devil Got My Woman" by Skip James in 1931, as well as "Pickin' Cotton Blues" by the bar band, Blueshammer.
There are songs by other artists mentioned in the film, including Lionel Belasco, which are reflective of the character Seymour, and of director Terry Zwigoff himself, who is a collector of 78 RPM records, as portrayed by Seymour. Other tracks are by Vince Giordano, a musician who specializes in meticulous recreations of songs from old 78 RPM records. Track 14-19 are not in the film, being selections from Zwigoff's collection.
Referenced in the film is R. Crumb & His Cheap Suit Serenaders, a band that Zwigoff played in. Enid asks Seymour about the band's second album, "Chasin' Rainbows", and Seymour replies, "Nah, that one's not so great."
Missing from the soundtrack is "What Do I Get?" by Buzzcocks, which can be heard when Enid dresses up like a punk, and the song "A Smile and a Ribbon" by Patience and Prudence.

KLIA East @ Labu

KLIA East @ Labu, (or KLIA-East or KLIA 2), was a proposed future budget carrier international airport. It would have been the third civilian airport serving Kuala Lumpur, or "KL", Malaysia.
The airport was to be located at Labu, which is 8.6 kilometres away from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). It was proposed by AirAsia, a Malaysian low-cost airline, to replace its use of the low cost carrier terminal (LCC Terminal) at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The airport at Labu was intended to serve AirAsia only, and the other airlines serving Kuala Lumpur, including full service carriers, low cost carriers as well as cargo airlines would continue to utilize Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
By road, the airport is 50 km from downtown Kuala Lumpur, compared to the distance of 78 km for Kuala Lumpur International. The construction of the new airport, on a 2,800ha area at the state’s central corridor in Labu, would have been financed by the private sector. The two parties involved in this project were AirAsia Holdings Group and Sime Darby who own the land. Construction was planned to start in mid-2009 and the new airport was anticipated to be ready by 2011.
However, after a meeting with the Cabinet Ministers of Malaysia, which includes the Deputy Prime Minister, the government instructed the airport operator of KLIA, Malaysia Airports Holding Berhad, to build the terminal at KLIA itself with close consultation with AirAsia. AirAsia will submit its wish-list and specifications to the operator for discussion.
Currently the former project is new site for the RMAF air force base.
Background.
Prior to the proposed airport, AirAsia is operating from the LCC terminal of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The terminal was initially build with a design capacity of up to 10 million passenger a year of which further extension to 15 million passenger a year. It was built on a fast track basis starting in June 2005 and opened 6 months later. The site was actually a cargo terminal converted into a passenger terminal with aprons for aircraft already built.
Demand for AirAsia has cause a surge in the usage of LCC terminal which resulted almost 9.5 million passengers in 2007. AirAsia was looking for new room to expand its operations and decided to use a purpose built low-cost carrier airport at a site near the current airport. It was reported on December 2008 that Sime Darby, the land owner for the new airport and AirAsia has given a green light for the building of the new airport in Labu, Negeri Sembilan. It was reported that the cost of building the airport will be totally privately funded by both AirAsia and Sime Darby.
The proposal and the speed of the cabinet giving it a green light has attracted many critics, including the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammed. Arguments against the airport includes duplication of facilities with the new airport and KLIA, questioning the issues on the airport will be privately funded, as some facilities such as access road may need to be borne by the government and also proximity between the two airports.
Finally, the criticism has made the cabinet to re-look the issue with the Deputy Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Razak asking AirAsia to present their case to him and other cabinet ministers and the airport operator Malaysia Airports. After the presentation, the cabinet decided that the proposal is off and asked AirAsia to work with the airport operator to build a new LCC Terminal inside KLIA.
Although there were talks that the decision on the airport has not been finalized yet, Deputy Prime Minister clarify that the project would not commence as Sime Darby lack funds to initiate infrastructure. He also confirmed that the new LCC terminal will be built within the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
Connectivity.
The KLIA East @ Labu will be connected with KLIA Main Terminal by:-
A 3 km KTM Komuter railway line also has been proposed from the railway station in Labu to KLIA East.
All the costs for building the airport, road and rail links will be privately financed.
Funding.
The funding for the building of the airport is reported to based on private finance initiative (PFI). Funds is expected to be provided by Sime Darby and AirAsia. However, critics questions the validity of the claim as some aspect of the airport operations such as Customs, Immigration and Quarantine facility may need to be borne by the government. The same argument also goes for other infrastructure such as building new KTM or ERL tracks to the airport.
Controversies.
Arguments for building the airport.
AirAsia has launch a cyber-campaign to promote the building and use of the airport. The company's chief executive office, Tony Fernandes has dubbed the airport as the Rakyat's Terminal (People's Terminal).
On its website AirAsia has listed down several justification on its need to build a new airport for its own purpose. Among them are:-
AirAsia has also list down the justification of choosing the site for the airport. Among them are:-
AirAsia on its website claims that building a second terminal building opposite the current one, as envision in the KLIA master plan was not possible due to Express Rail Link powers cable height issues.
According to a local business newspaper, AirAsia enjoys incentives such as waiver of all aeronautical charges except Passenger Service Charge, which is borne by the passenger expires in 2007. The incentive was given as a part of convincing AirAsia to move from Subang Airport to Kuala Lumpur International Airport. However, the incentives covers not only KLIA but all airports where AirAsia operated. Incentive covers waivers on landing, parking, aerobridge and check-in counter charges. It expected that AirAsia wants it own an airport to help better manage airport costs.
Argument against building the airport.
which amounted to "No to new airport, thanks".
Malaysia Airports Berhad, the airport operator has issues a series of press statements refuting AirAsia claims on airport charges while explaining delays on the construction of a permanent LCC terminal. The airport operator mentioned that:-
On the National Airport Master Plan study, the operator in collaboration with Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Finance, conducted a study on the direction of future development of airports and aviation infrastructure in Malaysia.
The issue is complicated by parties (on both sides) which allegedly appear to be interested only for their own benefits. What is more, some of the interested parties are companies partly or wholly owned by the government, or have links with the government. It seems less and less clear where politics come in, where decision is based on pure business, and which decision is truly in the "national interest". There has also been confusion on decisions from the Cabinet. Although it has approved the project earlier, the latest report from local free newspaper is the Deputy Prime Minister has now said ""We are studying the matter from all angles to see if the project should go ahead or if we can make some different arrangements."".
According to Singapore-based Straits Times economists and bankers have said of the debacle, "The wrangling (between the various parties) also highlights the (Malaysian) government's inability to rein in poor- performing public enterprises and pursue policies to maximise the use of resources." It also indicated "how the dominance of state-controlled agencies often stifles entrepreneurship (in Malaysia)". Analysts are calling for the Malaysian administration to referee the case (see External Links below). Air Asia is currently the largest and the most successful budget airline in the whole of Southeast Asia, pioneered by Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes. He privately bought Air Asia, then an ailing government-linked airline and turned it around as a no-frills budget airline until it was profitable and publicly listed but the public also pointed out that Air Asia receive a lot of benefits like tax waiver incentives, landing rights being fast tracked and also being given lucrative routes that previously serviced by the government-linked Malaysia Airlines.
Possibly the only thing that is becoming more clear is that the subject of this new airport development is now a very debatable issue within the country.

Johann Sachs

Johann Melchior Ernst Sachs (28 February 1843 – c. 1910) was a German romantic composer, who also held teaching and performing posts.
He studied first at Altdorf Seminary; taught in elementary schools from 1861 to 1863, and later entered the Munich College of Music and remained there from 1863 to 1865, before becoming a pupil there under Joseph Rheinberger, from 1867 to 1869, when it re-opened as the Royal Bavarian Music School, under the overall direction of Hans von Bülow.
Sachs conducted the Liederkranz Society from 1868 to 1872, and in 1871 was appointed a teacher of harmony at the Royal Music School. From 1869 until 1873 he conducted a male choral society at Munich, and he was the founder and conductor of the Tonkunstlerverein.
As a music theorist he held original opinions on many points. Among his numerous compositions, of which the greater part remain unpublished, are symphonies; symphonic poems; an opera, "Palestrina", which was performed at Ratisbon in 1886; a ballad, "Das Thal des Espingo", for chorus and orchestra; a paternoster; and one work of gigantic dimensions, entitled "Kains Schuld und ihre Sühne" ("Cain, His Sin and Atonement"), the production of which was intended to fill seven evenings. He also composed many songs and much piano music.

The Stephens Enquiry.
In 1989, twenty-eight UDR soldiers were arrested as part of The Stephens Inquiry into alleged collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. Twenty-six belonged to the same company of 7/10 UDR. Six were later awarded damages. One was charged with activities linked to loyalist paramilitaries. The Stephens team caused "intense anger" as three hundred police had been used to surround the homes of suspects. This had identified them as UDR soldiers to their neighbours, potentially putting their lives at risk. Eleven moved house as a result and the homes of eighteen others were provided with "additional security measures" at a cost of £25,000.
IRA infiltration?
At the start of June 1987 three attacks were made against soldiers of the same company of the battalion, including Private Joe Tracey who was shot dead as he started a new job on apartments off the Lisburn Road, Belfast. The "Belfast Newsletter" reported that 7/10 UDR had been infiltrated by the IRA. The commanding officer accepted that someone must have informed on him but denied that the IRA had been able to penetrate the battalion calling the allegation a "wild rumour".

8th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment

The 8th (County Tyrone) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment was formed on 1 December 1971 using companies, based in the east of the county, of the 6th Battalion Ulster Defence Regiment. It was, along with the rest of the regiment, subsumed into the Royal Irish Rangers in 1992 to form the Royal Irish Regiment.
History.
Battalion HQ was based at Killymeal House, Dungannon, which was also home for the Commanding Officer and his family. The operations room was located in the stables. 5 companies were dispersed between Killymeal House and the rest of the battalion area.
The first Commanding Officer was Lieutenant Colonel John Blackwell of the Royal Tank Regiment.
On 7 November 1974 a gunman hijacked a van with its driver. A 500 lb bomb was placed in the van and the driver ordered to take it to the local UDR base, which was J Company, 8 UDR. This was known in the terminology of the time as a Proxy bomb. The base was prepared for such an attack, as were most bases. When the van arrived at their base, a sergeant from J Company grabbed his SMG and forced the van driver to put his vehicle into what was known as a "Critpit" (named after its originator, Colonel I.R. Critchley, (Black Watch), deputy commander of 3 Infantry Brigade. The Critpit was a deep pit, large enough to hold a lorry, and lined with sandbags. The bomb exploded less than an hour later but the only damage done was a few shattered windows in the base and surrounding area.
Casualties.
The first soldier from the new battalion was killed on 7 December 1971. Lance Corporal Dennis Wilson, aged 31 J Company) had taken to his bed at home with a cold. At 10.30pm three armed men forced entry to his farmhouse near Caledon, County Tyrone, 300 yards from the border with the Republic of Ireland. One of them held his family at gunpoint in a downstairs room whilst the other two went upstairs and killed him.

10th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment

The 10th (City of Belfast) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment was formed in 1972 from elements of the 7th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment creating a second battalion in Belfast. It was again amalgamated with 7 UDR in 1984 to form the 7th/10th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment.
Gerry Adams wounded.
When Gerry Adams (the Sinn Féin president) was wounded in an assassination attempt by three members of the UFF it was an off duty full-time Non-commissioned officer of 10 UDR who gave chase to their car and arrested them, assisted by an off duty policeman. This is not noted in Adams' Sinn Féin biography and the BBC still insists the assailants were arrested by "plain clothes policemen". The UDR NCO received the Queen's Gallantry Medal for arresting the gunmen. In the long term however the soldier was intimidated out of his home and the UDR as a direct result of these arrests.
Investigations.
A 1977 Army investigation involving D Company, 10 UDR, based at Girdwood Barracks in Belfast revealed that about 70 of the company's soldiers were suspected of links to the UVF, but evidence was only found against two, who were dismissed on security grounds. 30 soldiers from D Company were suspected of fraudulently diverting £47,000 to the UVF; and that UVF members socialized at Girdwood Barracks junior ranks mess. This investigation was halted after a senior UDR officer claimed it was harming morale.

John Stewart (missionary)

John Stewart (1786-1823) was a missionary to the Wyandot Indians of Ohio and founder of what is often considered the first Methodist mission in America. Stewart was born in Powhatan County, Virginia to free Negro parents who were of mixed ancestry; a mix of white, black, and Indian.
Born in Virginia of free parentage, Stewart was a Baptist of mixed European and African descent. After he was robbed on his way to Ohio, he attempted to drink himself to death. Suffering agony of soul, he was delivered from depression by joining the Methodists during a camp meeting. He became ill from resisting a call to preach. Recovery commenced after he agreed to obey God. He heard the voice of a woman and a man calling him to preach to the Native Americans, and he set off in a northwesterly direction. He sang and preached to the Delawares on the way to the Wyandott Indians. Reaching the Wyandotts, he was befriended by a government agent who directed him to Jonathan Pointer, an African American who had been captured by the Indians and was fluent in Wyandott. With Pointer as interpreter, Stewart began to sing and to preach to them in 1816. Despite opposition, he warned the Wyandotts to “flee the wrath to come.” His singing and preaching resulted in the conversion of the chiefs, leading women, and others. Rival missionaries appeared and accused him of exercising ministerial functions without a license. Supported by native converts, Stewart requested recognition by the Methodist Episcopal Church and was accordingly licensed in 1819. The church supported his mission work financially and by appointing missionaries to continue it. Stewart’s example helped to inspire the formation of the Methodist Missionary Society in 1820.

AKARI Project

The AKARI Architecture Design Project was a project for designing a new generation computer network architecture supported by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) of Japan. The name comes from the Japanese word "Akari", which means "A small light (in the dark pointing to the future)". Launched in May 2006, the AKARI Project investigated technologies for new generation network by 2015, developing a network architecture and creating a network design based on that architecture. AKARI is also denoted as a Future Internet project.
The members of the AKARI Project came from NICT and some other universities or companies such as Tokyo University, Keio University, Osaka University, Tokyo Institute of Technology and NTT. In 2008, they produced a conceptual design book, which describes their philosophy to pursue an ideal solution by researching new network architectures from a clean slate without being impeded by existing constraints.
To some extent, the AKARI Project was similar to the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) facility of USA and many of the Seventh Framework Programmes (FP7) of EU such as the Future Internet Research and Experimentation.
Conferences were held in June 2007, January 2008, June 2008, and June 2010.
The project updated a web site through 2011, and removed the site by 2013.

Sannai-Maruyama site

Sannai-Maruyama site (三内丸山遺跡) is a Jōmon period archaeological site in Aomori, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. The site was discovered in 1992, when Aomori Prefecture started surveying a site for a planned baseball stadium. Archaeologists have used this site to further their understanding of the transition to sedentism and the life of the Jomon people. Excavation has led to the discovery of storage pits, above ground storage and long houses. These findings demonstrate a change in the structure of the community, architecture, and organizational behaviors of these people. Because of the extensive information and importance, this site was designated as a Special National Historical Site of Japan in 2000. Today the public can visit this site and its many reconstructions.
History.
Sannai Maruyama was first settled around 3900 BCE. The first settlers on the site lived in pit houses. These dwellings typically were about 3–4 meters (10–13 ft) in diameter. Over 500 pit dwellings have been found on site. Additionally, they stored their food in underground pits, which allowed them to hide it when they left the site since the occupants were not yet living a sedentary lifestyle.
Around 2900 BC, the way the site occupants lived and stored food began to change. They began to store food above ground in buildings rather than underground in pits. This change happened as they became more sedentary. Also, long houses began showing up around this time. Long houses were large, oval-shaped structures. The longest one found at the site was 32 meters long (105 ft). Scholars believe long houses were used for meeting places, workshops, or living space. Pit houses were still being inhabited at the same time that long houses existed on the landscape. 
One of Sannai Maruyama’s most famous structures, the large six-pillared building, was built around 2,600 BC. This structure consisted of six large pillars that are believed to have held up platforms. Each one of these pillars was around 1 meter in diameter and was placed exactly 4.2 m (13.8 ft) apart. Due to its large size, it is believed that this structure functioned as a monument or watchtower. Remains of other six-pillared buildings from different time periods have been found throughout the site. Many of the post holes from these buildings overlap each other, which suggests that the structures were being rebuilt in the same location and facing the same direction.
The settlement of Sannai Maruyama ended around 2300 BCE. 
The first major excavations of the site occurred in 1953 to 1967. These excavations involved teams from Keio University and the Board of Education of Aomori City. In 1976 and 1987, the Board of Education of Aomori Prefecture and Aomori City conducted further excavations on the southern part of the site.
A major breakthrough for the site came in 1992 while excavating during a pre-construction phase for a baseball stadium. This excavation uncovered how large Sannai Maruyama was as well as a large amount of artifacts. Excavations in June 1994 uncovered the large six-pillared building. Later that year it was announced that the site would be preserved and would live on as a historical site. After this was announced a number of the excavations were backfilled to protect the site.
Since 1994, around 26 additional test excavations have been done. These excavations have resulted in around 40% of the site being excavated.
Interpretation.
The site Sannai Maruyama was inhabited by hunter-gatherers around the time frame 3900 BC – 2900 BC. Over this period of time, the site changed from a seasonal camp, home to a more mobile society, to a settled village. Evidence of this sedentary lifestyle can be found in the form of intense use of natural resources such as nuts, fish, and a wide diversity of plants, as well as changes in storage facilities. 
Initially, the site was used as a temporary site. There were large pits used for storage and can be concealed since they were underground, which was preferred by mobile populations in many parts of the world. At Sannai Maruyama, the storage features changed from these underground pits to elevated granaries around 2900 BC. One interpretation of this change was that the once mobile group of inhabitants had become sedentary. 
Later in the site, we see longhouses that were built along with some pit houses at the site. The increase in housing also shows a more sedentary lifestyle (along with an increase in population). Also, there appeared to be several large posts that seemed to form a platform. This huge post shows a coordinated labor force since the sheer size of these posts would have required cooperation of several people to make. One interpretation of this large post like platform is that it was a base for a tower, or even a shrine.

Showdown (game)

Showdown is a trivia and word game that tests players’ general and popular culture knowledge, as well as their numerical skills and willingness to bluff and take a risk. It makes use of the Summit (puzzle) scoring system which awards higher scores for long answers containing letters towards the end of the alphabet.
Showdown is one of the first boxed games to integrate mobile telephone and text message technology, as players can text their answers to a Showdown number which calculates the value of their answers and replies within 10 seconds with their score. The game was created by Winning Moves in 2008. A mobile version of the game was launched in Ireland in 2002 by national broadcaster RTE and Zamano.
Showdown has been described as "Trivial Pursuit meets Scrabble" by Peter Sterling, Puzzles Editor for the Press Association.
How To Play.
Play begins when one player draws a "Topic Card" from the deck, and reads out the five topics on it. They range from general knowledge topics (a European country) to popular culture (a James Bond character) to the everyday (something found in a bathroom).
Players have two minutes to come up with an answer to each of the five topics, keeping in mind that if they come up with the same answer as another player, both will score 0 points. They also bear in mind the Summit scoring system, in which each letter A is worth 1 point, B is worth 2, C worth 3, up to Z which is worth 26. Other characters such as punctuation and spaces are ignored. For example, the band "ABBA" scores 6 points whereas "ZZ Top" scores 103. 
When the time is up, players with a valid answer for a topic can choose whether to go “in” or “out” depending on whether they feel they have a high-scoring, unique answer or not. If a player chooses “out”, they bank 5 points.
Once everyone has announced “in” or “out”, everyone’s answers are revealed. If one or more players have chosen “in” and have the same answer, they are knocked out and score 0. If a player has chosen “in” and has a unique answer, they can bank 10 points.
Now that everyone knows the other players’ answers, players must decide whether to enter "The Showdown" to try to win the maximum 20 points for that topic. "The Showdown" is where the Summit scoring system comes into play; the highest scoring word in "The Showdown" wins, and anyone losing "The Showdown "scores 0. Players announce “in” or “out” again, with players going “out” at this stage scoring 10 points.
If two or more players go “in” to "The Showdown", the scores are calculated and the highest-scoring answer wins 20 points. If only one player is willing to enter "The Showdown" (for example, if everyone thinks that one player’s answer is clearly much better than all the others) then that person automatically wins the 20 points. If two or more players have an equal Summit score (for example, the musicals "My Fair Lady" and "Calamity Jane" both score 114), then both players win 20 points for that topic.
The player with the most points after the 5 topics wins the game.
Strategy.
There are several strategies that can be used to win Showdown.
Unique answers.
It is possible to win the game without ever entering "The Showdown" itself, simply by coming up with unique answers and banking 10 points for each topic. For example, if the topic is Football Clubs, a player might choose Leeds United (118) over answers such as Wycombe Wanderers (193) or Wolverhampton Wanderers (289), in the knowledge that whilst Leeds United scores less, other players are unlikely to choose it for exactly that reason and therefore it is probable that it will be a unique answer.
Bluff.
Players can attempt to deceive their opponents by bluffing. This can either be in feigning confidence in the score of their answer before the actual score has been calculated, in an attempt to scare other players out of the game, or in feigning a lack of confidence in an attempt to suck other players into a Showdown and defeat them that way.
Risk taking.
As players are generally likely to choose a unique answer, players willing to take a risk can attempt a double bluff and choose an extremely obvious answer in the chance that other players have avoided it for that reason. For example, if the topic is Countries of the World, United States of America is an obviously high-scoring answer (228) because of its length and the number of high-scoring Ss and Ts. But because it is so obvious, players may avoid it because it is unlikely to be unique. This affords a brave player the opportunity to take a risk on both a unique and high-scoring answer.
Gameplay variation.
Showdown can also be played where players are attempting to get a low-scoring answer rather than a high-scoring one. For example, in this variation, a Hot Drink topic would see Tea (26) beating Coffee (40).
Online Textulator.
The Showdown website allows visitors to type in any answer and instantly calculate their scores, which can be used both while playing the game and to allow fans to compare the scores of anything from the names of their family members to the names of football players to try to find out what has the highest value.

Kenneth Crosby

Kenneth Crosby (1904-1998) was a British Wesleyan missionary, a Bible translator and language scholar, who worked in Sierra Leone. He is best known for his work in the Mende language.
Crosby was born May 12, 1904 at Briton Ferry, near Neath in South Wales. He graduated with a BD degree from the University of London in 1927, then a BA in philosophy from the same university. He left for Sierra Leone in 1929, though returned to Britain temporarily in 31, where he was ordained and also married to his fiancee Dorothy.
In Sierra Leone, his service included being a part of a team that translating the Bible into Mende, helping to found the Bunumbu Press, and serving as the first principal of Bunumbu Union College (now Bunumbu Teachers College).
In 1939, he was awarded a PhD degree from the University of London for his dissertation "A study of the Mende Language". He wrote of the Mende language, "I was brought up on the classics and had been taught that classical Greek was the most perfect instrument of speech ever devised. I accepted this, of course, unthinkingly and believfed it implicitly until I met the Mende language. But then I began to think differently. I marvelled at its incredible beauty, its wonderful cadences, its skillful nuances and the deeper I went the more I learned to wonder" (Tuchscherer 1998:220).
