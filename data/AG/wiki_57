Czechoslovakia–Soviet Union relations

Czechoslovakia–Soviet Union relations refers to the foreign relations between the former states of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.
Changes in interwar relations.
At the beginning of the existence of both states, their relation was bad. There was strong animosity sourcing from the armed conflict between Bolshevik authorities and Czechoslovak Legions and from the following participation of the Legions in the allied intervention against Bolsheviks. Moreover, Karel Kramář, Czechoslovak 1st Prime Minister, disliked the Bolshevik regime from personal reasons (his wife came from Russian nobility).
Czechoslovakia recognized the Soviet Union "de jure" not until 1934. On May 16, 1935 the Czechoslovak-Soviet Treaty of Alliance was signed between the two states as the consequence of Soviet alliance with France (which was the Czechoslovak main ally). At the insistence of the Czechoslovak government, a protocol on the signing of the treaty stipulated that the treaty would go into force only if France gave assistance to the victim of aggression. However, France did not support Czechoslovakia in 1938, having signed the Munich agreement instead.
World War II.
After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the establishing of pro-German Slovak puppet state in March 1939 Soviet Union quickly recognized new status quo and terminated the diplomatic relations with Czech representatives.
However, immediately after the German (and Slovak) attack in June 1941, Soviet government was the first who recognized the leaders of Czechoslovak resistance in London as the allied government and approved the formation of Czechoslovak armed forces from the refugees. In December 1943, new Treaty of Alliance (for next twenty years) was signed in Moscow and the Treaty of Military Cooperation followed next spring. From September 1944 to May 1945 the Red Army with joined Czechoslovak forces liberated most of the pre-Munich Czechoslovak territory, which was crowned by the liberation of its capital Prague on May 9. However, the easternmost part of Czechoslovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia, was annexed to USSR shortly after its liberation (and ceded officially to Soviet Union in 1946).
As a result of the synchronous annexation of eastern parts of Poland and Rumania, Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia gained common border - for the first time in their history.
Communist regime.
After the war the Soviet Union enjoyed a huge credit of the Liberator of Czechoslovakia and had strong influence on Czechoslovak foreign policy and on the rising power of Czechoslovak Communist Party. The non-communist parties in Czechoslovak government were in a trap when they tried to stop the rise of Communist and to keep the friendship of Soviet Union, which was widely regarded as the only prevention of future German aggression.
After the February 1948 Czechoslovakia was firmly set into the Soviet sphere of influence and the motto "Se Sovětským svazem na věčné časy!" (With Soviet Union forever!) represented the essence of the communist's policy. Inevitably Czechoslovakia became another Soviet satellite and any mark of disloyalty was bitterly suppressed in political trials under supervision of Soviet advisors (e.g. Slánský trial). Czechoslovakia was also constituent member of many Soviet-led international organisations, most notably the economic organization Comecon (1949-1991) and the military organization Warsaw Pact (1955–1991).
In two following decades Czechoslovakia was the most faithful Soviet's ally in the Central Europe. While the pro-soviet regimes in other states of Eastern Bloc, such as East Germany, Poland or Hungary underwent deep crisis after Stalin's death and later Khrushchev's criticism of Stalin, the friendship between Czechoslovakia and Soviet Union was undisputed.
The inconsistent changes in the slow process of deStalinization, led to the call for faster reforms among the people of Czechoslovakia. The old leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party was withdrawn in late 1967 and the new communist leader Alexander Dubček accelerated the reforms in economical, political and cultural life, as well as the rehabilitation of 50's-era victims. Though Dubček do not intend nothing else than refresh the regime, many people wanted more radical changes. This so-called Prague Spring in 1968 raised the scepticism and suspicion among leaders of other states of Eastern Bloc, especially in the Kremlin. The Soviet Union, Poland, and East Germany threatened Dubček in order to get him to not go through with the reforms. The threats from the Soviets increased and eventually lead to the August 1968 military invasion of Czechoslovakia.
After the occupation the official policy "With Soviet Union forever!" was again introduced, but the reputation of Soviet Union among Czechoslovak public was deeply decreased. When Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986 declared the Soviets will no more intervene in the affairs of Czechoslovakia, it was the beginning of the end of communist regime in Czechoslovakia.
After the collapse of Soviet Union and the later dissolution of Czechoslovakia their relations were replaced by bilateral relations of the succession states.

James George Bell

James George Bell (December 14, 1831 – November 23, 1911) was an American settler and businessman who is considered a founder of the city of Bell, California.
Biography.
Bell was born in Bowling Green, Kentucky and later moved to Missouri. His friend J. Edward Hollenbeck persuaded Bell to join him in California. James Bell arrived in San Francisco, California in 1875, then traveled down the coast to Los Angeles.
In 1875, Bell and his extended family purchased about of the California property, near modern Los Angeles. The area was originally part of the Spanish land grant Rancho San Antonio. Between 1870 and 1890, the grant was broken into smaller land holdings and acquired by newly arriving settlers.
Bell engaged in cattle raising and dry farming, developed water wells, and rented land to vegetable farmers. The Bell family initially lived at the Hollenbeck's "Town House" on 4th and Breed Street until moving to a "ranch" in 1876. The family's "Bell House" was built in an early Victorian architectural style. Bell helped the area develop into a small farming and cattle raising community. Originally known as Obed, the California town's name was changed in 1898 to "Bell" to honor the pioneer founder.
He served as Bell's first postmaster and rose through the ritual ranks of the Masonic Lodge. Late in life, Bell would subdivide his land into tracts of farms and move to Santa Fe Springs to live with his son Alphonzo, Sr. He was one of the founders of Occidental College.
Family life.
Bell married Dorothea ("Dolly") A. Reasons on July 17, 1856 in Missouri and they had children George, Mary, and Otis F. Bell, Sr. Dolly Bell died on November 27, 1864. In June 1866, Bell married Susan Abia Hollenbeck, a sister of his friend J. Edward Hollenbeck. James Bell had left his family in Missouri when he headed west in 1875. Six-months pregnant, Susan Bell and her four-year-old daughter Maude got on a box car to catch up with James in California. The fifth child, Alphonzo, Sr., was born in 1875.
James George Bell's son, Alphonzo Bell, Sr., was an oil millionaire, real estate developer and champion tennis player. He established the Bell Petroleum Oil Company, and used oil revenues to develop Bel-Air Estates. His grandson, Alphonzo E. Bell, Jr. was a popular 20th Century California Congressman. The Bell family also gave their name to Bell Gardens.

Miltoniopsis vexillaria

Miltoniopsis vexillaria ("The Flag-Like Miltoniopsis") is a species of epiphytic orchid in the genus Miltoniopsis.
Description.
The plants are pale green and about tall. Inflorescences are about long and carry up to four blossoms. The large, showy flowers are – across. They may be pink, often with white margins on the segments, or they may be white, sometimes with a pink flush or pink stripes. The lip, which has yellow markings at the base, is also marked with maroon stripes and blotches. The blossoms are very flat.
Distribution.
"M. vexillaria" is found in isolated patches in the central mountain region of Colombia and on the western slopes of the Cordillera Occidental from the department of Antioquia in the north and also further south in northern Ecuador. It grows on the margins of montane forests at between and .
Culture.
"M. vexillaria" is a cool growing species and thrives in a temperate, frost-free climate. It should be grown in moderate light with intermediate to warm temperatures and requires a humidity range of 50 to 90%. During hot summers, the plant should be watered daily.
In the winter, when the weather is cold and dull, the plant should be watered sparingly, but the growing medium should not be allowed to dry out. The winter temperatures should not fall below 10° Celsius (50° Fahrenheit), and good ventilation is essential.
Discovery.
"M. vexillaria" was first discovered in 1867 by the Victorian plant collector, David Bowman, who had been sent to South America by James Veitch & Sons of Chelsea, London. Bowman was unable to send a live sample back to England before he died of dysentery. Subsequently, other plant collectors, including Gustav Wallis and Benedikt Roezl, also came across the plant but the first collector to successfully introduce it to England was Henry Chesterton. In 1870, Chesterton had been sent by Harry Veitch to Colombia with the specific instructions to locate and bring back to England ""the much-talked-of and long-desired "scarlet Odontoglossum"." According to the account in Hortus Veitchii:
"Provided with but the scantiest information as to the native habitat, long kept secret and shrouded in mystery, Chesterton started, and not only succeeded in discovering the plant, but safely introduced it to Chelsea, where it flowered for the
first time in 1873."
Varieties and cultivars.
There are many cultivated varieties of "M. vexillaria" including:
Postage stamps.
In September 2006, "M. vexillaria" was featured on a series of postage stamps issued by the Ecuador postal authorities.

<doc id="20354546" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20354546" title="Patchogue Bay">
Patchogue Bay

Patchogue Bay is a lagoon on the south-central shores of Long Island in the U.S. state of New York.
Part of the Great South Bay, Patchogue Bay is a cove between the points of land known as Blue Point and Howells Point, and across which ferries run south to Fire Island.
Ownership.
Grant.
The Patchogue Bay bay bottom up to the barrier beach is owned by Brookhaven town though a grant by the King long before the existence of the union. It has been repeatedly adjudicated that the grant in the Dongan patent (Brookhaven Town, 1686) is valid. See references below. 
Federal government claim.
However, since 1968 the Federal government has been attempting to take title of and claim, by adverse possession, the bay bottom of both Islip and Brookhaven Towns extending outward from the barrier beach. It (the Federal Government) has repeated published intentionally erroneous maps (as the one below) showing boundaries of the Fire Island Seashore extending out into the bay when the real boundary is the shoreline of the barrier beach. 
Habitat.
A number of habitats make up the bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the cove's of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and mud crab. Atlantic oyster dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled by a number of factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, spot, Atlantic croaker, northern kingfish, and northern puffer. There are a number of significant trout resources in streams that drain into The Bay. Nine of the twelve verified wild brook trout populations of Long Island occur in the Bay's drainage. Patchogue's Swan River, and many other local tributaries such as Mud Creek, Patchogue Creek, and Terrel Creek all contain naturally reproducing populations of brook trout.
Today, Hard clams are the bay's principal resource, but this was not always the case. The once well-known eastern oyster fishery collapsed in the 1940s and 50's; that collapse was linked to algal blooms of a minute species that inhibited shellfish growth. These blooms were believed to be the result of high inputs of organic wastes, primarily from large-scale duck farms located on tributaries of the bay. A similar problem exists today in lawn fertilizer run off and is directly responsible for brown tide algae bloom and thus indirectly responsible for the collapse of the bay scallop population. During 1999 there was a significant spring drought (this may be verified through Brookhaven National Laboratory meteorological records, [http://www.bnl.gov/weather/4cast/MonthlyPrecip.htm]). That summer the bay was the cleanest it had been in memory. One could see clean sand bottom through 5 to 6 feet of water at the edge of the flats. Local baymen and sailors aged 50 and older remarked that they had never seen the bay so clean. There was no "brown tide" algae bloom that year.
References.
The original 17th Century Crown Patents, including the Nicolls, Dongan and Fletcher patents, gave certain Long Island townships title to the land within their bounds including the land under water (see O'Brien v Town of Huntington, 66 AD3d 160, 164 Dept 2009; Melby v Duffy, 304 AD3d 33 Dept 2003; Nance v Town of Oyster Bay, 23 AD2d 9 Dept 1965). The townships' ownership and control over these lands and water antedates the State and the Union itself and has been repeatedly upheld (see e.g. Lowndes v Huntington, 153 US 1; Trustees of Brookhaven v Strong, 60 NY 56; Rottenberg v Edwards, 103 AD2d 138 Dept 1984).

The Oslo University Hospital () is one of the largest hospitals in Scandinavia, with a work force of more than 20,000. It was established on 1 January 2009, by the merger of three of the university hospitals in Oslo: Rikshospitalet (The National Hospital) (founded in 1826, and also including the former Radiumhospitalet), Ullevål University Hospital (founded 1887), and Aker University Hospital (founded 1895). It is affiliated with the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Oslo (founded in 1811). CEO has since December 2011 been Bjørn Erikstein.
Oslo University Hospital consists of eight medical divisions in addition to the central unit, Oslo Hospital Services, which provides non-medical services to the rest of the hospital. The hospital has a total budget of NOK 17.5 billion. Oslo University Hospital is an emergency hospital for East and Southern Norway and has national emergency cover. The hospital is furthermore responsible for ambulance services, the 113 emergency calls service (equivalent to 112, 999 or 911), air ambulance and patient transportation in Oslo and the County of Akershus. Oslo University Hospital is a significant rôle player within the education of a large variety of health care personnel.
Research.
More than 50 per cent of the total medical research in Norwegian medical centres is performed at Oslo University Hospital. This is the result of the hospital’s general research strategy and its extensive international and national network cooperation.
In this way, the medical centre complies with the requirements of its staff and patients relating to its rôle as national reference hospital, responsible for introducing and developing new medical examination methods, treatment methods and follow-ups. Research that supports prioritised areas of commitment will also safeguard the operation and development of national and multi-regional assignments, as well as the functions of the medical resource centres.

The committee was constituted, by cooperation between communists and bourgeois anti-fascists, in March 1942. In its initial stage ÚNRV failed to take a prominent role in Slovak politics. The committee was however revived by the Communist Party, as the party opted for a broader approach in building a national front. By April-May 1943, the ÚNRV was crushed by the state apparatus.

Chris Smith (Florida politician)

Christopher L. "Chris" Smith (born March 15, 1970, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida) is a Democratic member of the Florida Senate, representing the 31st District, which includes eastern Broward County since 2012.
History.
Smith attended Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he received a degree in political science. He participated in Model United Nations while in college, even traveling to Moscow, Russia to participate in the International Model United Nations in 1990. Following his undergraduate work, he attended Florida State University, where he graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1995. He started working for the law firm Johnson, Anselmo, Murdoch, Burke & George, P.A., where he currently works. In 1995, he was appointed to the Fort Lauderdale Planning and Zoning Board. 
Florida House of Representatives.
Following the decision by Democratic State Representative M. Mandy Dawson to run for the Florida State Senate rather than seek re-election, Smith ran to succeed her. Smith faced Perry E. Thurston, Jr., Hazel K. Armbrister, and Fred Segal in the Democratic primary, which was opened to the entire electorate because all of the candidates were Democrats. Though Smith came in first place with 47% of the vote, the fact that he did not attain a majority mandated a run-off election between Smith and Thurston, the second place finisher, which he won in a landslide, receiving 58% of the vote. He was unopposed in the general election, and was re-elected without opposition in 2002. In 2004, Smith faced Sallie Tillman-Watson in the Democratic primary, but he turned away her challenge easily. He was re-elected to his final term in the general election without opposition. From 2004 to 2006, he served as the Minority Leader of the Florida House of Representatives.
Florida Senate.
In 2008, when State Senator M. Mandy Dawson was unable to seek another term due to term limits, Smith ran to succeed her in the 29th District, which includes parts of Broward County and Palm Beach County. In the Democratic primary, Smith defeated Earlen C. Smiley, the Deputy Superintendent of the Broward County School Board; Michael E. Carn; and Terry A. Williams Edden in a landslide. In the general election, he was elected without opposition. When Florida Senate districts were reconfigured, Smith was drawn into the 31st District and ran for re-election there. He faced Republican Chris Smithmyer, who was recruited by the Republican Party of Florida to run in Smith's district due to his similar-sounding name. Smith was endorsed for re-election by the "South Florida Sun-Sentinel", which praised him for becoming "the lead advocate for issues dear to Senate Democrats, from closing corporate tax loopholes to providing more state funding to make higher education more accessible and affordable." In the end, Smith was overwhelmingly re-elected over Smithmyer, receiving 84% of the vote. For the 2012-2014 legislative term, Smith served as the Senate Democratic Leader, and, by virtue of the fact that his party was in the minority, the Minority Leader of the Senate.

Charlie Oliver

Charles Joshua Oliver (1 November 1905 – 25 September 1977) was a New Zealand rugby union international who also represented his country in first-class cricket.
Wanganui born Oliver played as a specialist right-handed batsman and from 35 first-class matches scored 1301 runs at 23.23, with a best of 91. He represented Canterbury in domestic cricket, having debuted for them in the 1923/24 Plunket Shield. In the 1925/26 season he was a member of the New Zealand side which toured Australia and he made half centuries against Victoria and South Australia. He also toured the British Isles in 1927 with the national side. He claimed the only wicket of his first-class career during this tour, that of Sussex bowler Reginald Hollingdale.
New Zealand didn't gain Test status in cricket until 1930 and by then he had decided to focus on his rugby, thus missing out on a chance to become a Test 'double international'.
Oliver's early rugby had been played with Merivale before he made his way into the Canterbury side. He toured Australia in 1929 and made his Test debut for the All Blacks in a match against Australia at Sydney, aged 23. For the 1935/36 tour of Great Britain, Oliver was vice-captain and appeared in four Tests. By the time he retired he had amassed seven Test caps and 33 All Black matches in all, for 58 points. 
He spent the final years of his life in Australia and had a son-in-law, Dave Gillespie, who was also an All Black.

<doc id="20355117" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20355117" title="Mathias Dzon">
Mathias Dzon

Mathias Dzon (born 1947) is a Congolese politician who served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Finance from 1997 to 2002. Subsequently he was the National Director of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) from 2003 to 2008 and a candidate in the July 2009 presidential election, although he decided to boycott the election shortly before it was held. He is the President of the Patriotic Union for National Renewal (UPRN).
Political career.
Dzon was born in Ingouelé, near Gamboma. After studying in France, he began working at the BEAC in September 1977, rising to senior management positions. He became Director-General of the International Bank of Congo (BIDC) in April 1985.
During the single-party rule of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), which ended in 1991, Dzon was not a member the ruling party. He helped to found the UPRN in 1991 and became its President. He participated in the 1991 Sovereign National Conference, and during the Conference he placed fourth in the vote for the position of transitional Prime Minister. He was subsequently elected to the National Assembly as the UPRN candidate in Gamboma constituency. Under Dzon's leadership, the UPRN did not initially support the government or the opposition, but in September 1994 it joined the Democratic and Patriotic Forces (FDP) opposition coalition, thereby allying itself with the PCT, led by Denis Sassou Nguesso.
Dzon resigned from his post as Director-General of the BIDC in 1995 and instead took a post at the BEAC's agency in Pointe-Noire. He went into exile in 1996, going to Gabon and then France. Following Sassou Nguesso's return to power in the June–October 1997 civil war, Dzon returned to Congo-Brazzaville from France and was appointed by Sassou Nguesso as Minister of Finance and the Budget on 2 November 1997. He was retained in the government named on 12 January 1999 as Minister of the Economy, Finance, and the Budget.
In September 1999, the National Federation of Teachers called for Dzon to be prosecuted for alleged embezzlement of the salaries of teachers in August and September 1998. Speaking on television in January 2000, Dzon announced measures intended to fight corruption. He said in April 2000 that someone had tried to poison him with a paralysing liquid that was injected into his clothes. According to Dzon, the clothes were injected while in his suitcase at the Maya-Maya Airport as he prepared to fly to an International Monetary Fund conference in Washington, DC. The clothes subsequently changed color, were tested at a laboratory in the United States, and were found to contain a toxic substance. He did not specify who he believed to be responsible for this, but said that the people involved wanted him to replace him as Finance Minister.
In the May 2002 parliamentary election, Dzon stood as a candidate in Gamboma constituency, but shortly after the election he was disqualified by the National Electoral Commission, along with 11 other candidates. The disqualification was based on an allegation that he gave his supporters fraudulent documents to use in the election; in addition, he was alleged to have threatened officials. Although most of the candidates who were disqualified were banned from ever running in an election again, Dzon was not subjected to that penalty and was merely warned. After the election, he was replaced as Finance Minister by Roger-Rigobert Andely in the government that was appointed on 18 August 2002; Andely succeeded Dzon at his ministry on 20 August.
After leaving the government, Dzon was appointed as the BEAC's National Director for Congo, and he took office on 14 May 2003. The newspaper "Le Choc" reported on 20 July 2004 that Dzon, together with three other current or former ministers, had been barred from leaving the country without Sassou Nguesso's approval due to suspicions that they had misused public funds. This report was denied on the next day by public prosecutor Georges Akiéra.
The UPRN went into opposition in 2007, demanding the establishment of an independent electoral commission and boycotting the 2007 parliamentary election. It joined a new opposition coalition, the Alliance for the Republic and Democracy (ARD), in October 2007. On 25 June 2008, the UPRN announced that it had nominated Dzon to be the ARD candidate in the 2009 presidential election. No other names were submitted for the ARD nomination, and on 22 September 2008, ARD President Jean-Paul Bouiti announced that Dzon had been adopted as the coalition's candidate. In an interview with the African Press Agency in September 2008, Dzon said that Congo-Brazzaville needed "radical change", arguing that the country's high level of economic growth was not improving the living standards of ordinary people or state of infrastructure. Dzon left his post as National Director of the BEAC on 31 December 2008.
On 10 July 2009, two days before the presidential election, Dzon (who was considered the most important opposition candidate) and five other candidates called for the election to be delayed, claiming that the electoral lists were deeply flawed and included people who were not eligible to vote, as well as people who did not exist at all. At an opposition rally later on the same day, Dzon and other candidates called for the people to boycott the election. Dzon declared on the occasion that "for us, the election is not taking place on 12 July ... It will take place on the day the Congolese people are given a real choice."
As President of ARD, Dzon announced on 6 August 2010 that the coalition would not participate in the celebrations on 15 August marking the 50th anniversary of Congolese independence. He said that it was not an appropriate occasion to celebrate, as events since independence had, in his view, been full of disappointment and despair; according to Dzon, the day would instead be a time of remembrance and reflection for the people. In Dzon's assessment, "fifty years of independence are marked by failure. They are splattered with blood." He also criticized the government for spending money on the independence celebration while the people endured continuing poverty and deprivation.

Blazing Dragons (video game)

Blazing Dragons is an adventure video game based on the television series of the same name. It developed by The Illusions Gaming Company and published by Crystal Dynamics for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. In a twist on the legend of King Arthur, the player controls Flicker, a dragon who lives in Camelhot castle and is in love with Princess Flame, but is not eligible to ask for her hand in marriage because he is not a knight. However, the King has announced a dragon tournament, where the winner will not only win the princess but also become the new king. 
The humour in the game is heavily influenced by the British comedy of "Monty Python" (the game starring former "Monty Python" actor Terry Jones) and thus includes plenty of mild sexual innuendos, and other shenanigans.
Gameplay.
As a young Flicker, the player must collect various objects and interact with an eccentric cast of dragon and human characters in order to solve puzzles. The player's overall quest is to become a dragon knight to compete in the grand tournament and win the heart of Princess Flame. However, the player discovers an evil human plot to take over the kingdom by kidnapping the princess.
As is the case with many other graphic adventure games, the player can never die in the game or reach a point in the game where a puzzle cannot be solved.
Plot.
The evil Sir George and his wizard companion Mervin are plotting to conquer the kingdom of Camelhot and exterminate the dragons. After Sir George's failed siege against Camelhot, he declares his ally, the Black Dragon to win an upcoming dragon tournament the winner of whom shall be married to Flame and become the new king.
A young inventor named Flicker wishes to marry King All-Fire's daughter Flame, but he is rejected due to lack of knighthood. While rescuing King All-Fire's knights from their investigation of Black Dragon, he finds this Black Dragon is a mechanical dragon, then sabotages it. Sir Loungealot takes Flicker as a squire, but takes credit for Flicker's victory on the Black Dragon, prompting Flame to leave the castle, only to be kidnapped by Sir George and Mervin.
The King's Chancellor is secretly working for Sir George and steals Flicker's invention so Sir George can build a more powerful mechanical dragon. To prevent the King from noticing Flame's absence, Flicker has the court jester Trivet impersonate her.
Flicker infiltrates Castle Grim disguised as Sir George, releases Flame and gets the new mechanical dragon destroyed. By the time Flicker return to Camelhot, his deception is exposed and Flicker has to rescue the King's knights to earn his respect.
The next day, Flicker proves his worth at the Cave of Dilemma gaining his knighthood in time for the dragon tournament. Flicker makes it to the final, defeating Sir Loungealot, but then Sir George and Mervin invade with a newer Black Dragon. Flicker destroys the mechanical dragon once again. Mervin accidentally causes Sir George to fuse with the Black Dragon, transforming into the Black Dragon III. Sir George swallows Flicker, Mervin and King All-Fire, but Flicker cuts off the machine's power supply, causing the machine to be destroyed, reverting Sir George back to his human form and the machine lands on the Chancellor.
King All-Fire asks Flicker to marry his daughter as he secretly always wanted him, before he gained knighthood. Flick happily accepts the request.

Joe Slovo, Cape Town

Joe Slovo is an informal settlement in Langa, Cape Town. Like many other informal settlements, it was named after former housing minister and Anti-Apartheid activist, Joe Slovo. With over 20,000 residents, Joe Slovo is one of the largest informal settlements in South Africa.
While residents have been fighting for 15 years for their right to live in Langa, the settlement recently fell into prominence when it began to oppose the national pilot housing project of Lindiwe Sisulu called The N2 Gateway.
Residents have opposed the government's request that they be forcibly removed to Delft, a new township on the outskirts of the city. After a High Court ruling by controversial judge John Hlophe in favor of the Government, many experts in constitutional law have claimed the ruling to be unjust and against the South African Constitution.
Since then, residents have appealed the decision and taken it to the South African Constitutional Court. In August 2008, about 200 Joe Slovo residents travelled by train, spent the night at the Methodist Church in Braamfontein, and arrived at the Constitutional Court to protest proposed evictions. They were accompanied in solidarity by the Anti-Eviction Campaign as well as residents from Symphony Way, an informal settlement that is also in conflict with the government over the N2 Gateway Housing Project.
The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions and the Community Law Centre from the University of Cape Town, who joined the case as friends of the court, argue that the mass relocation will significantly impact resident's quality of life. 
During the case, constitutional court judges expressed concern over Judge John Hlophe's High Court ruling. Still, judgment has been reserved.

For emergency expenses (Rs 20/- per adult and Rs 15/- per child) that a person is entitled for, GoB had, till August 2008, paid Rs. 84.05 Crores against a demand of Rs. 1105 Crores made to the Center. This was just about 8 per cent of the requirement.
As far as CRF is concerned, there are no unlimited funds available with it. In the past five years Bihar has received only Rs.123.66 Crores in 2000-01, Rs. 129.84 in 2001-02, Rs. 136.33 Crores in 2002-03, Rs. 143.15 Crores in 2003-04 and Rs. 150.30 Crores in 2004-05. GoB is supposed to add 25 per cent more to this sum to claim the Central assistance. One can well imagine the gap that exists between the available small funds to the tune of Rs. 150 Crores against a demand of Rs. 8,000 Crores. Some money may be available through the channels of National Calamity Contingencies Fund (NCCF) but that too is drop in the ocean. The rest will have to be borne by the state Government or by the affected family itself. GoB asserts that it has spent all the money that it had with it (Rs. 850 Crores) to meet the flood disaster this year and it has further spent a sum of Rs. 250 Crores from other sources and has no money left to do any relief any more unless some help pours in from outside. The Chief Minister has requested the Center to allocate funds for that but such requests have a history of getting ignored.

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS) is a medical condition in which the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) held in and around a human brain and spinal cord leaks out of the surrounding protective sac, the dura, for no apparent reason. The dura, a tough, inflexible tissue, is the outermost of the three layers of the meninges, the system of meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. (The other two meningeal layers are the pia mater and the arachnoid mater).
A spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak is one of several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A "spontaneous" CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. A CSF leak is most often characterized by a severe and disabling headache and a spectrum of various symptoms that occur as a result of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). These symptoms can include: dizziness, nausea, fatigue, a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak), myoclonus, tinnitus, tingling in the limbs, and facial weakness among others. A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood at the site of the leak, fibrin glue injection or surgery.
SCSFLS afflicts 5 out of every 100,000 people. On average, the condition is developed at the age of 42, and women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain and nerve damage. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.
Actor George Clooney suffered from a CSF leak in 2005. Due to the intense pain Clooney considered suicide.
Classification.
SCSFLS is classified into two main types, cranial leaks and spinal leaks. Cranial leaks occur in the head. In some cases, CSF can be seen dripping out of the nose, or ear. Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both cranial and spinal spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the cranium. While referred to as "intracranial hypotension" the intracranial pressure may be normal, but low-volume CSF is instead the underlying issue. For this reason SCSFLS is referred to as "CSF hypovolemia" as opposed to "CSF hypotension".
Signs and symptoms.
Most people who develop SCSFLS feel a sudden onset of a severe and acute headache. It is a headache usually but not necessarily orthostatic in nature, typically becoming prominent throughout the day, in which usually the pain is worse when the person is vertical and less severe when horizontal. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, a metallic taste in the mouth, nausea, or vomiting. Leaking CSF can sometimes be felt or observed as discharge through the nose or ear. Orthostatic headaches can be incapacitating; these ailments often become chronic and can be sufficiently disabling to make those afflicted unable to work. Some patients with CSF leak will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon. This is known as "second-half-of-the-day headache". This may be an initial presentation of CSF leak or appear after treatment and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.
Lack of CSF pressure and volume allows the brain to descend through the foramen magnum, or occipital bone, the large opening at the base of the skull. The lower portion of the brain is believed to stretch or impact one or more cranial nerve complexes, thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms. Nerves that can be affected and their related symptoms are detailed in the table at right.
Causes.
The two main theories as to the underlying cause of SCSFLS are as a result of a connective tissue disorder or spinal drainage problems.
Connective Tissue Theory.
A spontaneous CSF leak is idiopathic; it can arise spontaneously or from an unknown cause. Various scientists and physicians have suggested that this condition may be the result of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS. 
Roughly 20% of patients with SCSFLS exhibit features of Marfan syndrome, including tall stature, chest divot (pectus excavatum), joint hypermobility and arched palate. However these patients do not exhibit any other Marfan syndrome presentations.
Spinal Drainage Theory.
Some other studies have proposed that issues with the spinal venous drainage system may cause a CSF leak. According to this theory, dural holes and intracranial hypotension are symptoms caused by low pressure in the epidural space due to outflow to the heart through the inferior vena cava vein.
Other causes.
Patients with a nude (absent) nerve root are at increased risk for developing recurrent CSF leaks. Cranial CSF leaks are as a result of intracranial hypertension in a vast majority of cases. The increased pressure causes a rupture of the cranial dura mater, leading to CSF leak and intracranial hypotension. Lumbar disc herniation has been reported to cause CSF leak in at least one case. Degenerative spinal disc diseases cause a disc to pierce the dura mater, leading to a CSF leak.
Another view of the cause of orthostatic headaches proposes a malformed distribution of craniospinal elasticity as a result of the collapse of the lower spine's CSF space resulting in the collapse of the dura sac.
Pathophysiology.
Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexus in the brain and contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.
Diagnosis.
The primary place of first complaint to a physician is a hospital emergency room. Up to 94% of those suffering from SCSFLS are initially misdiagnosed. Incorrect diagnoses include migraines, meningitis, and psychiatric disorders. The average time from onset of symptoms until definitive diagnosis is 13 months. A study found a 0% success rate for proper diagnosis in the emergency department.
Diagnosis of CSF leak can be done through various imaging techniques, chemical tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice, or clinical exam. The use of CT, MRI, and assays are the most common types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks are occult and do not show up on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators.
As most candidates for CSF leak do not have access to imaging and laboratory tools (modern medicine), clinical exam is the most often used means to diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.
CT.
Diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leak is performed through a combination of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, radiopaque contrast material is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.
MRI.
Magnetic resonance imaging is historically less effective at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed) and an Arnold-Chiari malformation in many, but not all, cases. An Arnold-Chiari malformation occurs when the brain sags and has a downward displacement due to the decreased volume and buoyancy of cerebrospinal fluid in which the brain floats. MRIs can present as completely normal, however, and are not the study of choice. An alternate method of locating the site of a CSF leak is to use heavily T2-weighted MR myelography. This has been effective in identifying the sites of a CSF leak without the need for a CT scan, lumbar puncture, and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. MRIs done on patients sitting upright demonstrated no difference in MRI results compared to those lying down. The use of intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography is also an alternative method of locating CSF leaks with a very high degree of success.
Assay.
When cranial CSF leak is suspected because of discharge from the nose or ear that is potentially CSF, the fluid can be collected and tested with a beta-2 transferrin assay. This test can positively identify if the fluid is cerebrospinal fluid.
CSF analysis.
Patients with CSF leak have been noted to have very low or even negative opening pressures. However, patients with confirmed CSF leaks may also demonstrate completely normal opening pressures. In 18–46% of cases, the CSF pressure is measured within the normal range. Analysis of spinal fluid may demonstrate lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein content or xanthochromia. This is hypothesized to be due to increased permeability of dilated meningeal blood vessels and a decrease of CSF flow in the lumbar subarachnoid space.
Clinical presentation.
The diagnostic criteria for SCSFLS is based on the 2004 International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) (Table 1) (50) criteria. However, the presentation of patients with confirmed diagnosis may be very different from that of the clinical diagnostic criteria and cannot be considered authoritative.
Treatment.
Epidural Blood Patch.
The treatment of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a 90% success rate in treating dural holes; a rate higher than that of a conservative treatment of bed rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into the area of the hole in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching.
Fibrin glue sealant.
If blood patches alone do not succeed in closing the dural tears, placement of percutaneous fibrin glue can be used in place of blood patching, raising the effectiveness of forming a clot and arresting CSF leakage.
Surgical drain technique.
In extreme cases of intractable CSF leak, a surgical lumbar drain has been used. This procedure is believed to decrease spinal CSF volume while increasing intracranial CSF pressure and volume. This procedure restores normal intracranial CSF volume and pressure while promoting the healing of dural tears by lowering the pressure and volume in the dura. This procedure has led to positive results leading to relief of symptoms for up to one year.
Neurosurgical repair.
For patients that do not respond to either epidural blood patching or fibrin glue, neurosurgery is available to directly repair leaking meningeal diverticula. The areas of dura leak can be tied together in a process called ligation and then a metal clip can be placed in order to hold the ligation closed. Alternatively, a small compress called a muscle pledget can be placed over the dura leak and then sealed with gel foam and fibrin glue. Primary suturing is rarely able to repair a CSF leak, and in some patients exploration of the dura may be required to properly locate all sites of CSF leak.
Other treatments.
The use of an abdominal binder has also been employed as a treatment.
Prognosis.
Final outcomes for people with SCSFLS remain poorly studied. Some of those afflicted continue to leak CSF from one or more sites and may suffer from unremitting symptoms for many years. People with chronic SCSFLS may be disabled and unable to work. Recurrent CSF leak at an alternate site after recent repair is common.
Complications.
Several complications can occur as a result of SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in the brain is severely decreased. This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.
People with cranial CSF leaks have a higher chance of developing meningitis than those with spinal CSF leaks. In addition, if cranial leaks last more than seven days, the chances of developing meningitis are significantly higher. Spinal CSF leaks do not usually result in meningitis due to the mostly aseptic conditions of the spinal dura. When a CSF leak occurs at the temporal bone surgery becomes necessary in order to prevent infection and repair the leak. Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to autonomic dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly. The autonomic dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem, which controls breathing and circulation.
An Arnold-Chiari malformation is a downward displacement of lower parts of the brain through the skull opening that occurs due to a lack of CSF volume and pressure. A further, albeit rare, complication of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia due to a sudden and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine. An extremely rare complication of SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where the ability to move one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve. Although other sources consider 3rd nerve palsy a common manifestation of CSF leaks. 
There are documented cases of reversible frontotemporal dementia and coma. Coma due to a CSF leak has been successfully treated by using blood patches and/or fibrin glue and placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position. Empty sella syndrome, a boney structure that surround the pituitary gland, occurs in CSF leak patients.
Epidemiology.
A 1994 community-based study indicated that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women were found to be twice as likely to be affected as men.
Studies have shown that SCSFLS runs in families and it is suspected that genetic similarity in families includes weakness in the dura mater, which leads to SCSFLS. Large scale population-based studies have not yet been conducted. While a majority of SCSFLS cases continue to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, an actual increase in occurrence is unlikely.
History.
Spontaneous CSF leaks have been described by notable physicians and reported in medical journals dating back to the early 1900s. German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand reported in 1938 and 1953 what he termed "aliquorrhea", a condition marked by very low, unobtainable, or even negative CSF pressures. The symptoms included orthostatic headaches and other features that are now recognized as spontaneous intracranial hypotension. A few decades earlier, the same syndrome had been described in French literature as "hypotension of spinal fluid" and "ventricular collapse". In 1940, Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic wrote about "headaches associated with decreased intracranial pressure". The full clinical manifestations of intracranial hypotension and CSF leaks were described in several publications reported between the 1960s and early 1990s. Modern reports of spontaneous CSF leak have been reported to medical journals since the late 1980s.
Research and experimental treatments.
IV Cosyntropin, a corticosteroid that causes the brain to produce additional spinal fluid to replace the volume of the lost CSF and alleviate symptoms, has been used to treat CSF leaks.
In two small studies of two patients and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume necessary for a patient to avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal saline infusion is used in urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness.
The gene TGFBR2 has been implicated in several connective tissue disorders including Marfan syndrome, arterial tortuosity, and thoracic aortic aneurysm. A study of patients with SCSFLS demonstrated no mutations in this gene. Minor features of Marfan syndrome has been found in 20% of CSF leak patients. Abnormal findings of fibrillin-1 has been documented in these CSF-leak patients, but only one patient demonstrated a fibrillin-1 defect consistent with Marfan syndrome.

Humber Keel

The Humber Keel was a type of sail craft used for inshore and inland cargo transport around Hull and the Humber Estuary, in the United Kingdom, particularly through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
The ship is a descendant of the Viking long ship. The term "keel" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word "ceol", which referred to a ship with a single mast and square rigging. The remains of keels from the 13th century have been excavated, and the keel is identified as a specific class of ship in the Tudor records kept by the Corporation of York. Early keels were designed to work in waterways which were only deep, but could still carry 40 to 50 tonnes of cargo. Such boats were clinker-built, meaning that the planks overlapped one another, but this gradually gave way to carvel construction, where the planks join edge to edge. First the bottom of the hull was carvel-built, with the sides still clinker-built, and then the whole boat used the newer method.
Keels were constructed to a variety of sizes, between long and between wide. They had strongly built hulls with a bluff bow, were steered by a tiller, and were designed to work in shallow waters, so that they could be used on the inland waterways connected to the Humber. By the 19th century, most of the hulls were built of oak, and the design was later copied by steel replacements. In the 20th century, steam and diesel engines replaced sail, with grants available to convert sailing vessels to mechanical power before the Second World War. All of the sailing keels had gone by 1949, but one has been preserved and returned to sail by the Humber Keel and Sloop Preservation Society. 
One advantage of the design was the ability to sail very close to the wind, which was essential on the narrow waterways on which they plied. They were also very manoeuvrable, and a single person could handle one on narrow and quiet waters. Stability was aided by a huge pair of leeboards, since the vessels did not have a central keel, and the small topsail was used when they were navigating the canals and rivers, but not usually when they were on the Humber estuary.
The dimensions of these craft were influenced by the gauge, or width, of inland waterways created or modernised during that period. In comparison to the widespread use of the Narrowboat standard, far fewer inland waterways were designed to accommodate the larger Humber Keel gauge vessels. This standard is still used on associated waterways today.

Hilary Teague

Hilary Teague (1802 – May 21, 1853) was an Americo-Liberian merchant, journalist, and politician in the early years of the West African nation of Liberia. A native of the U.S. state of Virginia, he was known for his oratory skills, and he pushed for Liberian independence from the American Colonization Society. Teague drafted the Liberian Declaration of Independence in 1847 and was later a member of the Senate of Liberia and served as the new country’s first Secretary of State.
Early life.
Teage was born free in the United States in the state of Virginia in 1805. His father, Colin Teage, was a prominent black Baptist preacher in both Richmond, Virginia, and later in Liberia who had purchased his freedom. The family emigrated to West Africa in 1821 to help establish a colony for former slaves in what is now the nation of Liberia.
The younger Teage served as a Baptist minister in Monrovia and was a merchant trading in palm oil. In 1835, Teage became the owner and editor of the "Liberia Herald" in Monrovia, after John Brown Russwurm left to become governor of the Republic of Maryland. As editor, Teage became a big promoter of Liberian independence and combined republicanism, black nationalism, and Christianity to make his case. He remained the newspaper's head until 1849, when he left to devote full attention to politics.
Political career.
In 1835, Teage became Colonial Secretary for the Liberian colony. In 1839, he was the clerk of the convention which presented the settlers' views to the American Colonization Society regarding constitutional reform. He was later an instrumental figure at the Constitutional Convention of 1847 - representing Montserrado County - in both debating and ratifying Liberia's constitution. He also wrote the country's Declaration of Independence, which railed against the their treatment as slaves and second class citizens in the United States. Teague became the republic's first Secretary of State after Liberia declared independence in 1847. Teage also composed Liberia’s hymn of independence.
He died in Liberia on May 21, 1853, and at the time was the country's attorney general.

Kendra Smith

Kendra Louise Smith (born March 14, 1960) is an American musician who was a founding member of Dream Syndicate, a member of Opal and Mazzy Star, and later recorded as a solo artist.
Biography.
After one privately pressed release with Suspects in 1979, Smith formed The Dream Syndicate in 1981 with Steve Wynn, and went on to record two albums and an EP as bassist with the group before leaving in 1984 to join former Rain Parade guitarist David Roback in Rainy Day (she had worked with Roback before, providing backing vocals on the Rain Parade album "Emergency Third Rail Power Trip").
Rainy Day released an album and a single in 1984 before Roback and Smith became a duo in the psychedelic-tinged band Opal.
Opal only released one record before they split up, the "Northern Line" EP, but recorded enough material for two compilation albums, "Happy Nightmare Baby" and "Early Recordings". Smith left Opal during the band's final tour and was replaced by Hope Sandoval, with Opal changing its name to Mazzy Star after the tour.
Smith formed a new band, The Guild of Temporal Adventurers, with Jonah Corey and A. Philip Uberman, who released an eponymous mini-LP in 1992, with Smith playing the pump organ, but her next release would not be until 1995 when her solo debut, "Five Ways of Disappearing" was issued on the 4AD label, and was described by "Trouser Press" as "an impressive — and colorful — achievement".
Not much is known about her after the solo album came out except according to 4AD she had moved to the woods of Northern California in the early 1990s, living in a small cabin with no electricity, and returned there after making two appearances to promote the album.

Temporal expressions

A temporal expression in a text is a sequence of tokens (words, numbers and characters) that denote time, that is express a point in time, a duration or a frequency. 
Examples:
Initially, temporal expressions were considered a type of named entities and their identification was part of the named entity recognition task. Since the Automatic Content Extraction program in 2004 there has been a separate task identified and called Temporal Expression Recognition and Normalisation (TERN). Timex evaluation is now evaluated in two major temporal annotation challenges: TempEval and i2b2, both of which prefer the TimeML-level TIMEX3 standard.
Approaches.
Similarly to NER systems, temporal expression taggers have been created either using linguistic grammar-based techniques or statistical models. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtained better results, but at the cost of months of work by experienced computational linguists. There are many such systems available now, so creating a temporal expression recognizer from scratch is generally an undesirable duplication of effort. Instead, current approaches focus on novel subclasses of timex.
Statistical systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data and are usually applied to the recognition task only (although there is work done using machine learning algorithms to resolve certain ambiguities in the interpretation step).

Latukan is flanked on the west by Makaturing volcano and on the NE by the historically active Ragang volcano. 
Latukan was listed as an active volcano in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Neumann van Padang, 1953), but the age of its most recent eruptions is not known. 
Latukan lies in an area of dominantly basaltic volcanoes west of the cordillera in central Mindanao.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) lists Latukan as an inactive volcano, without any indication as to why it considers Latukan to be inactive.
Like most volcanoes in southern Philippines, Latukan has not been well studied.

Hollywood Stunt Driver

Hollywood Stunt Driver is a stunt show at Warner Bros. Movie World, which originally opened on 26 December 2008. A sequel to the show, titled Hollywood Stunt Driver 2 will make its debut in February 2014. 
The first revision of the show replaced the Police Academy Stunt Show and put guests in the middle of an action movie set on location in Italy where stunt drivers are shooting the scenes for the new upcoming movie directed by Morgan Ross, a hot shot movie producer. The show features gun shots, explosions and car chases. Some of the features of the show include a police car split in half and a race car airborne. The show cost A$10 million to build and has an audience capacity of 2000.
The second revision will be run by Showtime FMX and feature motorcycle and car stunts.
History.
First rumours of a new stunt show surfaced in October 2007 with report that a Hot Wheels branded stunt show would replace the Police Academy Stunt Show by 2009. The same source stated that the new stunt show was inspired by the Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show at Disney's Hollywood Studios. In April 2008, Warner Bros. Movie World confirmed that the Police Academy Stunt Show would be removed by the end of the month and replaced with Hollywood Stunt Driver by October. Within two months of closing, nothing remained of the Police Academy Stunt Show. Significant demolition and construction was required to extend the old Police Academy Stunt Show arena. Not only is the new Hollywood Stunt Driver arena wider, it is also deeper as well. However, despite a scheduled October opening date, Hollywood Stunt Driver did not open until 26 December 2008. Even then it was described as in "preview" mode by the show's creator, Michael Croaker. Several of the stunts originally meant to be a part of the show were not included in the final cut including ramp-to-ramp jumps.
For Warner Bros. Movie World's 2009 Halloween Fright Nights event, the park teamed up with Showtime FMX who performed the Bloody Freestyle MotoX show in the Hollywood Stunt Driver arena. This was followed by similar shows in the park's subsequent Halloween events. Showtime FMX also ran the MotoMonster Xtreme show which replaced Hollywood Stunt Driver from 26 June 2011 through to 18 July 2011 as alternative winter holiday entertainment. On 21 November 2013, Hollywood Stunt Driver had its last show, with Showtime FMX's Overdrive show taking its place for a limited season until February 2014. Hollywood Stunt Driver 2 will be run by the Showtime FMX team and open to the public on 20 February 2014.
Hollywood Stunt Driver (2008-2013).
Plot.
Pre-show.
The doors open 30 minutes prior to show start due to guests coming in and taking their seats. Approximately 5 minutes before the show is set to begin, Dave (the cameraman) and Marty (a new crew member) comes out and tells the audience that they're on location in Italy shooting a scene for a new action movie, directed by Morgan Ross. They ask for individual volunteers from the audience to act out various scenes such as being in an armed hold-up, pointing at the getaway vehicle and "ooohing" and "aaahing" at near-misses. The final piece of filming with the audience is a mexican wave featuring all 2000 audience members. Dave then sends Marty off to get the buggy and to reset red rally car. A safety spiel then follows stating "In the interest of safety, ... please do not try anything of what you see here today, on your way home".
Introduction.
After over a minute of excitement-building music, a countdown is shown on the big screen. Once the countdown reaches zero, a black car, labelled ""Polizia"" (Italian for Police), appears under the big screen. The car drifts around the arena before being joined by a second police car. These two police cars proceed to drift in a figure 8 manner providing several near-misses before lining up perpendicular to the audience. At this moment a red rally car races out of left side of the arena and performs a 360, before drifting into the space left by the two police cars. The "Hell Drivers" are introduced before Morgan (the director), Ally (the assistant director), and Marty come out to the arena in the buggy. Morgan completes a short spiel about the movie before Mr. Hudson (the producer) interrupts through a video feed on the big screen.
Scene 1.
Scene 1 begins with Ally giving a short summary of what will happen in the scene. She then asks Dave to send a crew member to reset a rally car. At this moment Marty reverses the car into the set and parks it in front of the jewellery store. Before Marty has a chance to get out of the car, Morgan says action, and two criminals come onto the screen on a motorbike. One jumps off and breaks into the jewellery store. The other remains outside until a police car comes drifting from the right hand side of the arena. When the other thief comes out to find the motorbike gone, he runs over to the rally car and opens the door to find Marty sitting inside. The thief then proceeds to throw Marty out of the car before jumping in himself and driving the car in donuts around Marty. Annoyed, Morgan cuts the scene and sends Marty to catering to get some coffee and donuts. 
After an interlude by Mr. Hudson, furious about the need to re-shoot the first scene, the scene continues from where it left off. The rally car speeds up continuing the donuts that ended the first scene before speeding to the far left corner of the arena where a police car suddenly appears. The rally car brakes with just centimetres to spare. It then reverses half the width of the arena before performing a reverse-180 turn and driving towards the second police car at the far right of the arena. The rally car then speeds up to the left end of the arena with the second police car following it. At this point the rally car drifts the corner before returning to the right side performing a 180 skid to park the car perpendicular with the right wall. The two police cars follow performing the same manoeuvre resulting in the three cars being in parallel with each other. The rally car first races off the arena through the centre exit. The police cars then meet in the middle and perform donuts, with the nose of each car nearly touching the next, before following the exit of the rally car. At this point the motorcyclist makes his return by shooting a third police car with his gun, which causes it to split in half.
Scene 2.
Before moving onto the second scene the audience is treated to some of the footage edited on the big screen. This short clip features some pre-filmed shots with those that include the volunteers. The second scene begins with the rally car racing in from the left hand side and performing a 360 turn. This is followed by the two police cars who race in moments later. The three cars exit from the far right and return in the middle of the arena. The rally car then skids 180 and stops while the two police cars circle it. It then proceeds to reverse out of the arena. Upon returning, the car begins to perform a variety of figure 8 near-misses with the two police cars in reverse. Unknown to the audience at the time is that when the car is reversed out of the scene, it is swapped for a specifically designed, reverse car. The car is then swapped back to the forwards driving car in a similar style. At this point all three cars drive along a two-wheel kicker ramp, which allows the cars to drive on two wheels. All three cars drive in a figure 8 motion around the arena on two wheels before returning to all four at the same moment. The scene ends with the return of the motorcyclist who rides through a wall of fire before being stopped by the police.
Finale.
To re-shoot the first scene the rally car must be returned to outside the jewellery store. Without thinking, Dave sends Marty to do it again. A few moments later, vision from inside the rally car shows Marty's panicked state when he loses control of the car. At this instant, the rally car comes out onto the arena and begins driving wildly around the arena before taking the far left exit of the arena, labelled "Parking". After some security camera vision shown on the big screen, the rally car appears on the rooftop before crashing into a building, flying over more rooftops before landing in a second building. At this point some rocket-style fireworks and a large fireball explode out of the building. Once the fire has cleared, the rally car drives out of the first floor door of one of the shops. To conclude the show, all of the "Hell Drivers" come out including the specially designed reverse car, which features a modified outer-shell.
The Hell Drivers.
The Hollywood Stunt Driver team are known as the "Hell Drivers". At the time of the show's launch, the team was coordinated by Gavin Coleman and included:
Cars.
To create the show Warner Bros. Movie World purchased a fleet of Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Xs. One of the cars has had its shell removed and now exists on a specially designed rig that simulates the car flying across the rooftops of buildings. A second car has also had its shell modified to sit on reverse to display the effect of a backwards driving car.
Similar stunt shows.
A similar stunt show exists in two Disney theme parks. Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show and Moteurs... Action! Stunt Show Spectacular exist at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Walt Disney Studios Park respectively. Similar to Hollywood Stunt Driver, the show features a single red car being chased by multiple black cars while a movie is being produced. However, these two shows include more cars, due to a larger arena size and show length. Another main difference is the red car in the Disney shows is considered the "hero car" with the black cars labelled as the "bad guys". This is the reverse in Hollywood Stunt Driver.
Hollywood Stunt Driver Pit Pass.
From 26 December 2010, Warner Bros. Movie World began offering the Hollywood Stunt Driver Pit Pass. For a fixed cost, guests can pay to receive a behind the scenes tour of Hollywood Stunt Driver, reserved show seating, lunch, photo and a stunt driving experience. Guests can experience the stunts shown in the show and receive a USB copy of the session at the end.

Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil

The Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil, sometimes referred to as the French Champion Hurdle, is a Group 1 hurdle race in France which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Auteuil over a distance of 5,100 metres (about 3 miles and 1½ furlongs), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.
History.
The race was first run on May 25, 1874, the same day as the inaugural running of the Grand National de France (now the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris). It was originally open to horses aged four or older, and it was initially contested over 4,000 metres. This was increased to 4,800 metres in its second year, and to 5,000 metres in 1880. The race was given a new date in 1882 – it was moved to the Wednesday after the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris, which continued to be run on the last Sunday in May. The following year saw the launch of a new steeplechase at Auteuil, the Prix des Drags, and this was scheduled for the Friday of the same week. This week of top class jump races became known as the "Grande Semaine d'Auteuil". The Grande Course de Haies was run as a handicap until 1889, but since then it has held weight for age conditions.
The race was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918. During World War II it was cancelled only once, in 1940. The minimum age was raised to five in 1961, when a new hurdle race, the Grande Course de Haies des 4 Ans (later titled the Prix Alain du Breil), was introduced specifically for four-year-olds. The distance of the Grande Course de Haies was extended to 5,100 metres in 1969. This was cut to 4,100 metres in 1975, and then restored to 5,100 metres in 1979.
Four horses have won both this event and the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris. These are Blagueur II, Loreto, Ubu III and Mid Dancer. The 1947 winner of the Grande Course de Haies, Le Paillon, later won the most prestigious flat race in France, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The 1984 winner, Dawn Run (a mare trained in Ireland), also won both the Champion Hurdle and the Cheltenham Gold Cup in England. She returned to Auteuil to attempt a repeat victory in 1986, but during the race she misjudged a hurdle, fell, and died almost instantly.
In 2010, the race was won by flat jockey Christophe Soumillon.

Mas Cal Demoura

Mas Cal Demoura is a wine domaine situated near the village of Jonquières in the Terrasses du Larzac appellation in the north of the Hérault region, Southern France.
Working with the regional red varieties of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Cinsaut and Carignan, (once described by its founder as the 'Five woman of the Languedoc'), and the white varieties Chenin blanc Grenache blanc, Roussanne, Viognier, Muscat and Gros Manseng, the domaine has been described by "La Revue du vin de France" as, 'One of the most classic ambassadors of its appellation.' 
History.
The history of the Domaine is perhaps one of the most richly resonant of the Hérault, its story so closely interwoven with that of the region in general. This story has been perhaps best set down by Neal Rosenthal, renowned American importer of wines and author of "Reflections of a Wine Merchant":
'In 1970, when there was a great exodus from the Languedoc due to a loss of faith in its vineyards to provide a sufficient living, Jean-Pierre Jullien named his domaine "Cal Demoura", which in Occitan means "one must remain". He came from a long line of vignerons and, at that time, he followed most of his colleagues as they closed their caves and attempted to survive by participating in the local cooperative. Jean-Pierre's son, Olivier, refused to follow the path of the cooperative and established his own domaine, the "Mas Jullien", in 1985. Jean-Pierre, in a reversal of the usual process, took the example of his son, resigned from the cooperative and recreated his own estate in 1993.'
Lawrence Osborne writing his book, The Accidental Connoisseur recounts the same tale and goes on to touch on some of the unique qualities of Cal Demoura.
'Mas Cal Demoura is one of the intriguing success stories of modern Languedoc wine. The Julliens have been farming wine for generations around the sleepy villages of Jonquieres and Saint-Felix-de-Lodes. It was his son Olivier Jullien who decided in 1985 to start a new winery called Mas Jullien based on completely different principles: it would make a terroir wine, not cooperative wine. In 1993 Jean-Pierre started a winery of his own, Cal Demoura.'
'We drank one of Jean-Pierre's softly earthly wines, a Coteaux du Languedoc L'Infidèle 2001, and then a pure Cinsault, one of the five Southern varietal with which the Julliens work, blending their wines from all five. Terroir, again? It was rustic and gay, I decided, and here (unlike Daumas) I could taste something of the earth. Garrigue, perhaps, though
to find garrique in a Languedoc wine is the smoothest of cliches. More to the point there was something of Jean-Pierre in Jean-Pierre's L'Infidèle. Something booming, warm, square-shouldered. but how could I not think of this since he was gesticulating right in front of me?...It struck me that Aimé Guibert and Jean-Pierre Jullien both expounded the truths of terroir. They spoke a similar language on the surface. And they worked the same land. But how different their mental universes were. How different too, was their conception of place.'
In 2004, Jean-Pierre retired, and the responsibility of the domaine was taking up by Isabelle and Vincent Goumard in his place. Impressed by the estate's winemaking philosophy and the potential of its terroir, the couple worked side by side with Jean-Pierre in the vineyard and in the cellar, before continuing its legacy. As an example, the vintage 2003 was handled by both Jean-Pierre and Vincent. Vincent Goumard also found support in Jean-Pierre's son, Olivier Jullien.
The Gourmard's have handled the delicate task of guiding Mas Cal Demoura forward while retaining its unique qualities well, with "Decanter Magazine" reporting in 2005, ‘Talented young winemaker, Vincent Gourmard looks set to carry the domaine's reputation for excellence in the future.’ and "La Revue du vin de France" in 2008, "Isabelle and Vincent Goumard have succeeded in their conversion of Cal Demoura. The future is bright for these meticulous young winemakers, able to benefit from past experience." The style of the wines have slowly evolved to gain more complexity and more delicate structure. The 2007 and the 2008 vintage are clearly among the best produced by Mas Cal Demoura.
Vineyard.
The vineyard area extends to 11 ha. with vines planted on stony limestone and calcareous clay (red and white) soils. Vines average around 25 years of age. The vineyards benefit from cooling northern winds from the Causse du Larzac over the ripening period during summer nights contributing greater freshness to the wines, as well as sea influence brought by southern winds, said to limit the effects of drought.
Production.
The domaine produces 40 000 bottles a year.
Two white wines are nowadays available:
and three red wines:

Renji Hospital

Renji Hospital () is a general hospital in Shanghai, China, with the rank of "Grade 3, Class A". The hospital is a university hospital affiliated to 
Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.
History.
It was the first western hospital in Shanghai and the second in China. William Lockhart, a missionary from Britain, rented a house in the inhabited area near Da Dong Men (Big East Gate) of Shanghai County and opened this hospital in 1844(Dao Guang 24 year, Qing Dynasty). It was once named as 'the Chinese Hospital'. Two years later, the hospital moved to Mai Jia Quan (Middle Shandong Road now), and changed its name to Shantung Road Hospital also called Renji Yi Guan (Chinese: 仁济医馆). Renji had 60 beds and started an out-patient clinic. In 1927 (ROC 16 year), the hospital accepted the heritage from a British merchant, Henry Lester, with one million tael silver and four pieces of real estate, which were used to expand the hospital. In 1932 (ROC 21 year), a building with six floors was constructed for the hospital, the beds were increased to 250, and its name became Renji Hospital, some people called it the Lester Chinese Hospital. Renji Hospital had 300 beds in 1949. 
In November 1952, Shanghai Second Medical College took over the charge of Renji Hospital from East China Health Care Administration and called Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Second Medical College. In the 'Cultural Revolution', the hospital once changed its name to 'Gong Nong Bing Hospital' (workers, farmers and armymen's hospital) and 'The 3rd People's Hospital'.

Delft, Cape Town

Delft is a township on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa. It is situated next to the Cape Town International Airport, Belhar, Blue Downs & Site C, Khayelitsha. It is notorious for its high crime rate, substandard schools, lack of jobs, and numerous government built housing projects such as the N2 Gateway .
History.
Delft was established in 1989. It is a rapidly expanding community found within the Eastern District of the City of Tygerberg local authority. This community was originally established as an integrated service land project for 'coloureds' and 'blacks'.
Geography and Demographics.
Delft is situated approximately 34 km north east of Cape Town, and approximately 7,5 km from Bellville. It was established to be one of Cape Town's first mixed race township including 'coloured' and 'black' residents.
In 2000, it had a population between 25 000 and 92 000 inhabitants.
According to the 2001 census, Delft is currently 73% Coloured and 25% Black African with almost no Whites and 1% Indians. The most prominent languages are Afrikaans and Xhosa while English is in wide use as a second language. The majority of residents have not finished their matric. Official unemployment levels are at about 43% (although unofficially, this might be much higher).
Delft is subdivided into six sections namely, The Hague, Rosendal, Voorbrug, Eindhoven, Leiden and Delft South. The first three sections are predominantly 'coloured' while Eindhoven is partially inhabited by 'coloureds' and blacks and Delft South and Leiden are predominantly 'black'.
Much of Delft consists of government housing projects. The newest projects are the Symphony which is the main part of the N2 Gateway Pilot Project as well as Temporary Relocation Areas (TRAs) such as Tsunami and the Symphony Way TRA.
Subdivisions.
Delft is a big Township. It is divided into 7 places(divisions) namely Delft South (Suburban), Voorbrug, Leiden (Delft Central),Eindhoven, Roosendal, The Hague & the new Symphony section. Delft South also known as Suburban which is predominantly populated by Xhosa speaking people, Leiden (Delft Central) is a mixed community of both Xhosa speaking and Afrikaans speaking people. Voorbrug, The Hague, Roosendal & Eindhoven is predominantly populated by Afrikaans speaking Coloured people.
In the news.
Delft recently became newsworthy because of the controversial N2 Gateway housing project. The shackdwellers of Joe Slovo Informal Settlement in Cape Town have publicly refused to be forcibly removed to Delft. Also, in December 2008, backyard dwellers occupied over 1000 N2 Gateway houses in the new Symphony section of Delft. DA Councillor Frank Martin who was accused of inciting thousands of poor people to occupy these houses. Eventually, the families who occupied the houses were violently evicted by police who used rubber bullets to put down the protest. News of the violent repression reached international news with some people saying that it has severely hurt South Africa's reputation.
. Evicted residents are now living in makeshift shacks on Symphony Way which has widely become known as "Blikkies Dorp" across from the houses. This was believed to have been temporary housing for the evicted dwellers, however they are still occupying the said "blikkies dorp" for the past five years.

Thirumeyyam

Thirumeyyam is an ancient Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. It is located Thirumayam in the district of Pudukottai, Tamilnadu, India, 21 km from Pudukottai on the Pudukottai-Karaikudi highway. It is one of the "Divya Desams", the 108 temples of Vishnu revered by the 12 poet saints, or Alwars.
The Temple.
The presiding deity is called Sathyagiri Nathan/Sathya Murthi(Vishnu). The temple is old and large, and striking in appearance. The main statue of Lord Sathyagiri nathan, approximately seven feet in height, is standing on a rock, along with his wives. In the next Sannidhanam(sanctum), Lord Mahavishnu's sculpture is in sleeping position, the position which is called in Tamil "Ari thuyil", sleeping with a sense of knowing what is going on at present. Sculptures of Lord Mahavishnu in this position can be viewed in many temples, although this is one of the largest examples. There are many "sannidhis" in the temple. All the statues are sculptured beautifully. The devotees who like to pray before Lord Mahavishnu in his "Ari thuyil" position for some minutes and who want to pray for few minutes before Sri Renganathar, Srirangam and didn't get such a chance, may visit Thirumeyyam. 
It is where the largest Anantasayi(Vishnu in reclining pose) in India. It is a natural cavern which has been changed into a shrine.
The temple is adjacent to the Sathyagiriswara temple, located in the same complex. The temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a ticketed monument.
The fort.
The fort, the Siva and Vishnu temples are the tourist attractions. The fort played an important role in the history of Thondaiman rulers of Pudukottai and the British. The 40 acre fort was built by Vijaya Ragunatha Sethupathi of Ramanathapuram in 1687 AD. On the hill, there is a rock-cut Siva temple with inscriptions on music. There are relics of another fort. At the foot of the hill are the Siva and Vishnu temples. It was in this fort that the brother of Kattabomman, Oomathurai was ensnared and imprison. An old armour used by him is exhibited here.

<doc id="20355654" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20355654" title="Tibetan Empire">
Tibetan Empire

The Tibetan Empire existed during the 7th, 8th, and 9th centuries A.D., and ruled an area considerably larger than the Tibetan Plateau that stretched mostly to parts of East Asia, Central Asia and South Asia.
At its height, the empire's influence and control of territories stretched from modern-day Sikkim, East Turkistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Bangladesh, north Pakistan, north Afghanistan, north India, north Nepal, Bhutan and parts of China.
The historic name for the Tibetan Empire is different from Tibet's present name.
Traditional Tibetan history preserves a lengthy list of rulers, whose exploits become subject to external verification in the Chinese histories by the seventh century. From the 7th to the 11th century a series of emperors ruled Tibet – see List of emperors of Tibet. Throughout the centuries from the time of the emperor Songtsän Gampo the power of the empire gradually increased over a diverse terrain so that by the reign of the emperor Ralpacan, in the opening years of the ninth century, its influence extended as far south as Bengal and as far north as Mongolia.
The varied terrain of the empire and the difficulty of transportation, coupled with the new ideas that came into the empire as a result of its expansion, helped to create stresses and power blocs that were often in competition with the ruler at the center of the empire. Thus, for example, adherents of the Bön religion and the supporters of the ancient noble families gradually came to find themselves in competition with the recently introduced Buddhism.
Namri Songtsen and founding of the Dynasty.
The power that became the Tibetan state originated at the castle named Taktsé () in the Chingba ("Phying-ba") district of Chonggyä ("Phyongs-rgyas"). There, According to the Old Tibetan Chronicle a group convinced Tagbu Nyazig ("Stag-bu snya-gzigs") to rebel against Gudri Zingpoje ("Dgu-gri Zing-po-rje"), who was in turn a vassal of the Zhangzhung empire under the Lig myi dynasty. The group prevailed against Zingpoje. At this point Namri Songtsen (also known as Namri Löntsän) was the leader of a clan which one by one prevailed over all his neighboring clans. He gained control of all the area around what is now Lhasa, before his assassination around 618. This new-born regional state would later become known as the Tibetan Empire. The government of Namri Songtsen sent two embassies to the Chinese Sui Dynasty in 608 and 609, marking the appearance of Tibet on the international scene.
Reign of Songtsän Gampo (618–650).
Songtsän Gampo ("Srong-brtsan Sgam-po") (c. 604 – 650) was the first great emperor who expanded Tibet's power beyond Lhasa and the Yarlung Valley, and is traditionally credited with introducing Buddhism to Tibet. 
When his father Namri Songtsen died by poisoning (circa 618,) Songtsän Gampo took control, after putting down a brief rebellion. Songtsän Gampo proved adept at diplomacy as well as combat. The emperor's minister, Myang Mangpoje ("Myang Mang-po-rje Zhang-shang"), defeated the Sumpa people ca. 627. Six years later (c. 632–33) Myang Mangpoje was accused of treason and executed. He was succeeded by minister Gar Songtsän ("Mgar-srong-rtsan").
The Chinese records mention an envoy in 634. On that occasion, the Emperor requested marriage to a Chinese princess but was refused. In 635-36 the Emperor attacked and defeated the Tuyuhun (Tibetan: "‘A zha"), who lived around Lake Koko Nur, and who controlled important trade routes into China. After a Tibetan campaign against China in 635-6, the Chinese emperor agreed (only because of the threat of force, according to Tibetan sources) to provide a Chinese princess to Songtsän Gampo.
Circa 639, after Songtsän Gampo had a dispute with his younger brother Tsänsong ("Brtsan-srong"), the younger brother was burnt to death by his own minister Khäsreg ("Mkha’s sregs") (presumably at the behest of his older brother the emperor).
The Chinese Princess Wencheng (Tibetan: "Mung-chang Kung-co") departed China in 640 to marry Songtsän Gampo's son. She arrived a year later. This is traditionally credited with being the first time that Buddhism came to Tibet, but it is very unlikely Buddhism extended beyond foreigners at the court.
Songtsän Gampo’s sister Sämakar ("Sad-mar-kar") was sent to marry Lig-myi-rhya, the king of Zhangzhung in what is now Western Tibet. However, when the king refused to consummate the marriage, she then helped her brother to defeat Lig myi-rhya and incorporate Zhangzhung into the Tibetan Empire. In 645, Songtsän Gampo overran the kingdom of Zhangzhung.
Songtsän Gampo died in 650. He was succeeded by his infant grandson Trimang Lön ("Khri-mang-slon"). Real power was left in the hands of the minister Gar Songtsän.
There is some confusion as to whether Central Tibet conquered Zhangzhung during the reign of Songtsän Gampo or in the reign of Trisong Detsän, (r. 755 until 797 or 804 CE). The records of the "Tang Annals" do, however, seem to clearly place these events in the reign of Songtsän Gampo for they say that in 634, Zhangzhung and various Qiang tribes "altogether submitted to him." Following this, he united with the country of Zhangzhung to defeat the Tuyuhun, then conquered two more Qiang tribes before threatening the Chinese region of Songzhou with a very large army (according to Tibetan sources 100,000, according to the Chinese more than 200,000 men). He then sent an envoy with gifts of gold and silk to the Chinese emperor to ask for a Chinese princess in marriage and, when refused, attacked Songzhou. According to the "Tang Annals", he finally retreated and apologised and later the emperor granted his request,
It is recorded in the tradition of Tibet, that after Songtsen Gampo died in 650 A.D., the Chinese Tang dynasty attacked and took control of Lhasa, "but they could not sustain their presence there in the hostile environment, so they soon returned to China."
Reign of Mangsong Mangtsän (650–676).
After having incorporated Tuyuhun into Tibetan territory, the powerful minister Gar Songtsän died in 667.
Between 665–670 Khotan was defeated by the Tibetans, and a long string of conflicts ensued with the Chinese Tang Dynasty. In the spring of 670, Tibet attacked the remaining Chinese territories in the western Tarim Basin. With troops from Khotan they conquered Aksu, upon which the Chinese abandoned the region, ending two decades of Chinese control. They thus gained control over all of the Chinese Four Garrisons of Anxi in the Tarim Basin in 670 and held them until 692, when the Chinese finally managed to regain these territories.
Emperor Mangsong Mangtsen ("Trimang Löntsen"' or "Khri-mang-slon-rtsan") married Thrimalö ("Khri-ma-lod"), a woman who would be of great importance in Tibetan history. The emperor died in the winter of 676–677, and Zhangzhung revolts occurred thereafter. In the same year the emperor's son Tridu Songtsen ("Khri 'dus-srong btsan" or "Khri-'dus-srong-rtsan") was born.
Reign of Tridu Songtsän (677-704).
Emperor Tridu Songtsän ruled in the shadow of his powerful mother Thrimalö on the one hand and the influential Gar ("Mgar") clan on the other hand.
In 685 the minister Gar Tännyädombu ("Mgar Bstan-snyas-ldom-bu") died and his brother, Gar Thridringtsändrö ("Mgar Khri-‘bring-btsan brod") was appointed to replace him. In 692, the Tibetans lost the Tarim Basin to the Chinese. Gar Thridringtsändrö defeated the Chinese in battle in 696, and sued for peace. Two years later in 698 emperor Tridu Songtsän invited the Gar clan (over 2000 people) to a hunting party and had them executed. Gar Thridringtsändrö then committed suicide, and his troops joined the Chinese. This brought to end the power of the Gar family.
From 700 until his death the emperor remained on campaign in the north-east, absent from Central Tibet, while his mother Thrimalö administrated in his name. In 702 China and Tibet concluded peace. At the end of that year, the Tibetan imperial government turned to consolidating the administrative organization khö chenpo ("mkhos chen-po") of the north-eastern Sumru area, which had been the Sumpa country conquered 75 years earlier. Sumru was organized as a new "horn" of the empire.
During the summer of 703, Tridu Songtsän resided at Öljag ("‘Ol-byag") in Ling ("Gling"), which was on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, before proceeding with an invasion of Jang ("‘Jang"), which may have been either the Mosuo or the kingdom of Nanzhao. In 704, he stayed briefly at Yoti Chuzang ("Yo-ti Chu-bzangs") in Madrom ("Rma-sgrom") on the Yellow River. He then invaded Mywa, which was at least in part Nanzhao (the Tibetan term "mywa" likely referring to the same people or peoples referred to by the Chinese as Man or Miao) but died during the prosecution of that campaign.
Reign of Tride Tsuktsän (704–754).
Gyältsugru (Rgyal-gtsug-ru), later to become King Tride Tsuktsän ("Khri-lde-gtsug-brtsan"), generally known now by his nickname Me Agtsom ("Old Hairy"), was born in 704. Upon the death of Tridu Songtsen, his mother Thrimalö ruled as regent for the infant Gyältsugru. The following year the elder son of Tridu Songtsen, Lha Balpo ("Lha Bal-pho") apparently contested the succession of his one-year-old brother, but was "deposed from the throne" at Pong Lag-rang.
Thrimalö had arranged for a royal marriage to a Chinese princess. The Princess Jincheng (金成) (Tibetan: Kyimshang Kongjo) arrived in 710, but it is somewhat unclear whether she married the seven-year-old Gyältsugru or the deposed Lha Balpo. Gyältsugru also married a lady from Jang (Nanzhao) and another born in Nanam.
Gyältsugru was officially enthroned with the royal name Tride Tsuktsän in 712, the year that dowager empress Thrimalö died.
The Caliphate and Göktürks became increasingly prominent during 710–720. The Tibetans were allied with both. Tibet and China fought on and off in the late 720s. At first Tibet (with Göktürk allies) had the upper hand, but then they started losing battles. After a rebellion in southern China and a major Tibetan victory in 730, the Tibetans and Göktürks sued for peace.
In 734 the Tibetans married their princess Dronmalön ("‘Dron ma lon") to the Göktürk Qaghan. The Chinese allied with the Caliphate to attack the Göktürks. After victory and peace with the Göktürks, the Chinese attacked the Tibetan army. The Tibetans suffered several defeats in the east, despite strength in the west. The Göktürk empire collapsed from internal strife. In 737, the Tibetans launched an attack against the king of Bru-za (Gilgit), who asked for Chinese help, but was ultimately forced to pay homage to Tibet. In 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir.
By 750 the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese. In 753, even the kingdom of "Little Balur" (modern Gilgit) was captured by the Chinese. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the Caliphate and Qarluqs at the Battle of Talas (751), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence began to increase again. Tibet conquered large sections of northern India during this time.
In 755 Tride Tsuktsän was killed by the ministers Lang and ‘Bal. Then Tagdra Lukong ("Stag-sgra Klu-khong") presented evidence to prince Song Detsän ("Srong-lde-brtsan") that they were disloyal and causing dissension in the country, and were about to injure him also. Subsequently, Lang and ‘Bal really did revolt. They were killed by the army and their property was confiscated."
Reign of Trisong Detsän (756–797 or 804).
In 756 prince Song Detsän was crowned Emperor with the name Trisong Detsän ("Khri sron lde brtsan") and took control of the government when he attained his majority at 13 years of age (14 by Western reckoning) after a one-year interregnum during which there was no emperor.
In 755 China had been greatly weakened by the An Shi Rebellion, which would last until 763. In contrast, Trisong Detsän's reign was characterized by the reassertion of Tibetan influence in Central Asia. Early in his reign regions to the West of Tibet paid homage to the Tibetan court. From that time onward the Tibetans pressed into the territory of the Tang emperors, reaching the Chinese capital Chang'an (modern Xian) in late 763. Tibetan troops occupied Chang'an for fifteen days and installed a puppet emperor while Emperor Daizong was in Luoyang. Nanzhao (in Yunnan and neighbouring regions) remained under Tibetan control from 750 to 794, when they turned on their Tibetan overlords and helped the Chinese inflict a serious defeat on the Tibetans.
In 785, Wei Kao, a Chinese serving as an official in Shuh repulsed Tibetan invasions of the area.
In the meantime, the Kyrgyz negotiated an agreement of friendship with Tibet and other powers to allow free trade in the region. An attempt at a peace treaty between Tibet and China was made in 787, but hostilities were to last until the Sino-Tibetan treaty of 821 was inscribed in Lhasa in 823 (see below). At the same time, the Uyghurs, nominal allies of the Tang emperors, continued to make difficulties along Tibet's Northern border. Toward the end of this king's reign Uyghur victories in the North caused the Tibetans to lose a number of their allies in the Southeast.
Recent historical research indicates the presence of Christianity in as early as the sixth and seventh centuries, a period when the Hephthalites had extensive links with the Tibetans. A strong presence existed by the eighth century when Patriarch Timothy I (727-823) in 782 calls the Tibetans one of the more significant communities of the eastern church and wrote of the need to appoint another bishop in ca. 794.
There is a stone pillar (now blocked off from the public), the Lhasa Shöl "rdo-rings", Doring Chima or Lhasa Zhol Pillar, in the ancient village of Shöl in front of the Potala in Lhasa, dating to c. 764 CE during Trisong Detsen's reign. It also contains an account of the conquest of large swathes of northwestern China including the capture of Chang'an, the Chinese capital, for a short period in 763 CE, during the reign of Emperor Daizong.
Reign of Muné Tsenpo (c. 797–799?).
Trisong Detsen is said to have had four sons. The eldest, Mutri Tsenpo, apparently died young. When Trisong Detsen retired he handed power to the eldest surviving son, Muné Tsenpo ("Mu-ne btsan-po"). Most sources say that Muné's reign lasted only about a year and a half. After a short reign, Muné Tsenpo was supposedly poisoned on the orders of his mother.
After his death, Mutik Tsenpo was next in line to the throne. However, he had been apparently banished to Lhodak Kharchu (lHo-brag or Lhodrag) near the Bhutanese border for murdering a senior minister.
The youngest brother, Tride Songtsän, was definitely ruling by 804 CE.
Reign of Tride Songtsän (799–815).
Under Tride Songtsän ("Khri lde srong brtsan" - generally known as Sadnalegs) there was a protracted war with the Abbasid Caliphate. It appears that Tibetans captured a number of Caliphate troops and pressed them into service on the eastern frontier in 801. Tibetans were active as far west as Samarkand and Kabul. Caliphate forces began to gain the upper hand, and the Tibetan governor of Kabul submitted to the Caliphate and became a Muslim about 812 or 815. The Caliphate then struck east from Kashmir, but were held off by the Tibetans. In the meantime, the Uyghur Khaganate attacked Tibet from the northeast. Strife between the Uyghurs and Tibetans continued for some time.
Reign of Tritsu Detsen (815–838).
Tritsu Detsen ("Khri gtsug lde brtsan"), best known as Ralpacan, is important to Tibetan Buddhists as one of the three Dharma Kings who brought Buddhism to Tibet. He was a generous supporter of Buddhism and invited many craftsmen, scholars and translators from neighbouring countries. He also promoted the development of written Tibetan and translations, which were greatly aided by the development of a detailed Sanskrit-Tibetan lexicon called the "Mahavyutpatti" which included standard Tibetan equivalents for thousands of Sanskrit terms.
Tibetans attacked Uyghur territory in 816 and were in turn attacked in 821. After successful Tibetan raids into Chinese territory, Buddhists in both countries sought mediation.
Ralpacan was apparently murdered by two pro-Bön ministers who then placed his anti-Buddhist brother, Langdarma, on the throne.
Tibet continued to be a major Central Asian empire until the mid-9th century. It was under the reign of Ralpacan that the political power of Tibet was at its greatest extent, stretching as far as Mongolia and Bengal, and entering into treaties with China on a mutual basis.
A Sino-Tibetan treaty was agreed on in 821/822 under Ralpacan, which established peace for more than two decades. A bilingual account of this treaty is inscribed on a stone pillar which stands outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa. The full text of the treaty with its remarkable imagery describing the relationship between the Tibetan King and Chinese Emperor as one of "nephew and uncle" can be found at [http://www.tpprc.org/documents/agreements/821-822.pdf]
Reign of Langdarma (838–842).
The reign of Langdarma ("Glang dar ma"), regal title Tri Uidumtsaen ("Khri 'U'i dum brtsan"), was plagued by external troubles. The Uyghur state to the north collapsed under pressure from the Kyrgyz in 840, and many displaced people fled to Tibet. Langdarma himself was assassinated, apparently by a Buddhist hermit, in 842.
Decline.
A civil war that arose over Langdarma's successor led to the collapse of the Tibetan Empire. The period that followed, known traditionally as the Era of Fragmentation, was dominated by rebellions against the remnants of imperial Tibet and the rise of regional warlords.

Reg Bartley

Reginald James (Reg) Bartley (3 February 1899 – 16 January 1982) was a businessman, company director and Lord Mayor of Sydney in 1943–1944 and 1946–1948. He was succeeded by Ernest Charles O'Dea. A Civic Reform Association member, Bartley was attacked by a member of the Communist Party of Australia over a proposal to demolish "Maramonah", a mansion in central Sydney, inhabited by 600 squatters, in order to build a park. Bartley's plan was eventually taken up, and the site of the mansion is now a park in King's Cross. Bartley later said that he regretted the incident had become one between "communists and lawful authority".
In March 1946 Bartley was instrumental in moving to demolish the Sydney Mint and the Hyde Park Barracks, stating that they should "make way for modern structures".
Bartley's service to the City of Sydney is commemorated by the naming of Reg Bartley Oval at Rushcutters Bay and Bartley Street, Chippendale. The City of Sydney Florence Bartley Library was named in honour of Bartley's wife and Lady Mayoress Florence.

Dorsey Hall

Dorsey Hall is a historic home located in the Columbia community of unincorporated Howard County, Maryland, United States. It is a six-by-one-bay, -story stucco structure with a gable roof covered with asphalt shingles. It is a well-preserved and detailed example of the vernacular dwellings of the early 19th century in Howard County and associated with the Dorsey family, one of the "first families" of the county.
Dorsey Hall was built on Dorsey's Search, a parcel of land patented by John Dorsey of Hockley-in-the-hole (1645–1714) in Baltimore County (now Howard County). The 479-acre (194 ha) property adjacent to the north branch of the Patuxent river was surveyed by Richard Beard in December 1684, and granted to Dorsey in March 1696. The surrounding residential neighborhood of "Dorsey's Search" was named after the original land grant. The farm operated with slave labor until the death of Caleb Dorsey in 1864.
In 1963, owner Julius Mandel and Gudelsky Company attempted to rezone the site for high-rise apartments. It was then purchased by the The Rouse Company shell company Columbia Industrial Development Corp. for redevelopment which halted in 1968 by residential opposition. The building underwent a renovation in 1979. 
The 5.4 acres of land surrounding Dorsey Hall was acquired by The Rouse Company and resold to land developers Richard Talkin and Donald Reuwer for $785,000. In 2000, A $3.5 million dollar 32,000 square feet office project broke ground with County executive James N. Robey. By 2001, the site of the estate was subdivided and reduced to 2 acres with a survey claiming no outbuilding were present unlike the neighboring Woodlawn Estate form the same period. 
Dorsey Hall now stands at the entrance to a business park (comprising mostly medical offices) at 5100 Dorsey Hall Drive, the architecture of which is compatible with the building. However, although it forms an imposing image, it has no signage or other identification and is not open to the public. The confusion is amplified by the adjacent business park at 5010 Dorsey Hall Drive, which bears a sign naming itself the "Dorsey Hall Business Park."
Just north of Maryland Route 108, Dorsey Hall is technically at the southern edge of unincorporated Ellicott City, Maryland, rather than the northern edge of Columbia. 
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

<doc id="20355828" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20355828" title="Cat gap">
Cat gap

The cat gap is a period in the fossil record of approximately 25 to 18.5 million years ago in which there are few fossils of cats or cat-like species found in North America. The cause of the "cat gap" is disputed, but may have been caused by changes in the climate (global cooling), changes in the habitat and environmental ecosystem, the increasingly hypercarnivorous trend of the cats (especially the nimravids), volcanic activity, evolutionary changes in dental morphology of the Canidae species present in North America, or possibly even attributed to patterns of periodicity of extinctions (climatic/floral cycles called "van der Hammen cycles")
Cat evolution.
All modern carnivorans, including cats, evolved from miacoids, which existed from approximately 66 to 33 million years ago. Miacoid species gave rise to "Proailurus" (meaning "first cat"; also called "Leman's Dawn Cat"), which appeared about 30 million years ago, and is generally considered the first "true cat". There were other cat-like species before "Proailurus", but not within the family of the order Carnivora.
The increase in disparity through the early Miocene occurs during a time when few feliform fossils have been found in North America. The hypercarnivorous nimravid feliforms were extinct in North America after 26 Ma and felids did not arrive in North America until the Middle Miocene with the appearance of "Pseudaelurus". "Pseudaelurus" crossed over to North America by way of the Bering land bridge from surviving populations in Asia 18.5 million years ago. All modern-day cats are descended from "Pseudaelurus".
Nimravids were saber-toothed cat-like animals of the family Nimravidae. Although not "true cats" in the Felidae family, Nimravidae are considered to be a sister taxon to felids. They are basal feliforms, but their exact placement within the Carnivora group is still uncertain. Physically, Nimravidae resembled the "Smilodon" (which would not evolve until many millions of years later). Nimravidae also became extinct in North America during the "cat gap."
Hypercarnivorous tendency as a probable cause of the cat gap.
The history of carnivorous mammals is characterized by a series of rise-and-fall patterns of diversification in which declining clades are replaced by phylogenetically distinct but functionally similar clades. Over the past 50 million years, successive clades of small and large carnivorous mammals diversified and then declined to extinction. In most instances, the cause of the decline was energetic constraints and pervasive selection for larger size (Cope's rule) that lead to (hypercarnivory) dietary specialization. Hypercarnivory leads to increased vulnerability to extinction.
The nimravids were large cats that occupied this ecomorphic niche in the ecosystem until 26 Ma. It is highly likely that their hypercarnivory led to their extinction in North America. After the extinction of the nimravids there were no other feliform or felid-like species until other felids arrived from Eurasia after crossing the Bering land bridge 18.5 million years ago. During this time there was great diversity among the other carnivorous mammals in North America – both hypocarnivorous and hypercarnivorous species – and other hypercarnivorous species existed before, during, and after the cat gap.
Changes in climate and habitat.
One possible explanation for the extinction of feliforms in North America is changes in the ecology of the continent. Evidence from the geologic temperature record shows that the earth was experiencing a period of global cooling, causing forests to give way to savannas. Climatic changes to arid conditions that muted variation at about 25.8 Ma coincides with the first appearance of hoglike creodonts and of pocket gophers, and this also is the beginning of the "cat gap" and the "entelodont gap", a period of some 7 million years when there were no nimravids, felids, or entelodonts in North America. Faunal overturn at 25.8 Ma is the basis for division of the Arikareean time period (30.5–19 Ma), and the Arikareen NALMA (North American Land-Mammal Ages), into the Monroecreekian period (29.5–25.8 Ma), and then the Harrisonian period (25.8–23.5 Ma).
Other possible causes of the cat gap.
Volcanic activity has also been promoted as a possible cause of the cat gap as well as other extinctions during this time period. The La Garita Caldera is a large volcanic caldera located in the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado, United States, and is one of a number of calderas that formed during a massive ignimbrite flare-up in Colorado, Utah, and Nevada during the Oligocene Epoch. The La Garita Caldera was the site of the Fish Canyon eruption, an enormous eruption about 27 million years ago. The scale of the Fish Canyon eruption was far beyond anything known in human history (erupting more than for a VEI 8+ magnitude), and was possibly the most energetic event on Earth since the Chicxulub impact, which is thought by many paleontologists to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The resulting explosive volcanism probably ejected large amounts of dust and debris into the stratosphere causing major cooling (see volcanic winter). Climatic effects could also have been caused by sulphur ejected into the stratosphere, which rapidly converts to sulphuric acid, an aerosol which cools the troposphere by blocking incoming solar radiation.
Another possible cause of the cat gap could have been the late Cenozoic ice age that began approximately 30 million years ago. This ice age caused glaciation in Antarctica that eventually spread to Arctic regions of southern Alaska, Greenland, and Iceland. Glaciers on the North American continent, as well as the cooling trend, could have made the ecosystem uninhabitable for feliformia cat-like species, although habitable for cold-weather caniformia species such as canids (dog-like species), mustelids (weasel-like species), and ursids (bear-like species).
Evolution of caniforms during the cat gap.
It has been suggested by some that as a result of the cat gap caniforms (dog-like species including canids, bears, weasels, and other related taxa) evolved to fill more carnivorous and hypercarnivorous ecological niches that would otherwise have been filled by cats. This conclusion, however, is disputed.
However, other paleontologists take issue with this conclusions:

Bondz N'Gala

Bondz Bondzanga N'Gala (born 13 September 1989) is an English professional footballer who currently plays for League Two side Portsmouth, as a central defender.
N'Gala began his career at West Ham United, progressing through the youth ranks before signing a professional deal with the club in 2008. In January 2008, he joined Conference National side Weymouth on loan until the end of the 2007–08 season, although the loan deal was ultimately cut short. The following season, N'Gala was loaned to Milton Keynes Dons for a month. He returned to his parent club, and made his first-team debut for West Ham in September 2009. Two months later, in November 2009, N'Gala was briefly loaned to Scunthorpe United, playing just two games for the club. In March 2010, N'Gala joined Plymouth Argyle on loan for the remainder of the 2009–10 campaign. On returning to West Ham, he was released, and opted to sign for Plymouth on a permanent basis ahead of the 2010–11 season. He spent one season with the club, before signing for Yeovil Town on a free transfer in July 2011. A year later, N'Gala signed for Stevenage for an undisclosed fee, spending a month on loan at Barnet during the season. He was released by Stevenage in May 2013.
Club career.
West Ham United.
N'Gala began his career at West Ham United, joining the club at the age of 13 and progressing through the youth ranks, before signing a professional contract in 2008. N'Gala featured regularly in West Ham's reserve side for several seasons, including captaining the side on a number of occasions. In January 2008, N'Gala was loaned out to Conference National side Weymouth for the remainder of the 2007–08 campaign. He made his debut in Weymouth's 0–0 home draw with Kidderminster Harriers in the FA Trophy, and made two further appearances in defeats against Woking and Rushden & Diamonds. Although N'Gala's loan deal was supposed to run until the end of the season, he returned to West Ham a month into his loan agreement following a change of management at Weymouth. Ahead of the 2008–09 season, N'Gala travelled with the first-team squad on their pre-season tour of the United States. Reserve team manager Alex Dyer stated a desire for the player to go out on loan to a Football League side during the season in order to gain match experience, and he was subsequently loaned out to Milton Keynes Dons in November 2008. During his one-month loan deal, N'Gala made three appearances, making his debut in a 3–0 victory over Walsall on 22 November 2008. He returned to his parent club in December 2008, and spent the rest of the season playing in the club's reserve side.
In September 2009, N'Gala made his first-team debut for West Ham, coming on as a 63rd minute substitute in the club's 3–1 League Cup defeat away at Bolton Wanderers. It ultimately turned out to be his only first-team appearance for the club. A month later, he signed for Championship side Scunthorpe United on a one-month loan deal. He made his debut for Scunthorpe in a 4–1 away defeat to Blackpool, with N'Gala coming on as a second-half substitute in the match. N'Gala returned to West Ham at the end of November 2009, having made only two appearances for Scunthorpe. In March 2010, he was loaned out for a fourth time, this time signing for Championship club Plymouth Argyle on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season. He made his debut a week after signing, on 23 March, playing the whole match as a relegation threatened Plymouth secured an important 2–0 away victory over Ipswich Town. He made nine appearances during his loan spell, and was singled out for praise by Plymouth manager Paul Mariner, in a season that witnessed the club suffer relegation back to League One. N'Gala was released by West Ham at the end of the season, with the club opting against renewing his contract.
Plymouth Argyle.
Following his release by West Ham, N'Gala joined Plymouth Argyle on a permanent basis in May 2010, signing a two-year contract. He played in the club's first game of the 2010–11 season, a 1–0 victory over Southampton at St Mary's. N'Gala received the first red card of his career in Plymouth's 3–2 home win against Sheffield Wednesday on 18 September 2010, being dismissed for bringing down Neil Mellor when through on goal. He scored his first professional goal in March 2011, netting the opening goal of the match with a "low drive" from just inside the area, in a 4–2 win over Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. He made 28 appearances in all competitions during the campaign, scoring once, as Plymouth struggled with financial difficulties throughout the season — a season in which the PFA provided Plymouth players with "financial support" due to unpaid wages. Plymouth were deducted ten points by the Football League for an 'insolvency event', which breaks Football League sanctions and commands an automatic ten-point penalty, and the club were ultimately relegated for a second consecutive season.
Yeovil Town.
Due to Plymouth entering administration, N'Gala was told he was free to leave the club. In July 2011, he subsequently signed for League One side Yeovil Town on a free transfer. He made his Yeovil debut in the club's 2–0 defeat to Brentford on the opening day of the 2011–12 season. N'Gala scored his first goal for the club in October 2011, scoring just before half-time when he headed in Ed Upson's inswinging corner in an eventual 2–2 draw with Leyton Orient. He doubled his goal tally for the campaign the following month, scoring the only goal of the game as Yeovil secured a 1–0 away victory at Hartlepool United. The goal came in similar fashion to his first for the club, with N'Gala heading in an Ed Upson corner. During his one season at Yeovil, N'Gala made 35 appearances in all competitions, scoring twice.
Stevenage.
In July 2012, N'Gala signed for Stevenage for an undisclosed fee, signing a one-year contract with the club, with the option of another year. Stevenage manager Gary Smith stated he signed N'Gala on recommendation, after assistant manager Mark Newson had worked with the player during his time coaching at West Ham's academy. N'Gala made his debut in the club's first game of the 2012–13 season, playing the whole match in the centre of defence as Stevenage defeated AFC Wimbledon 3–1 in the League Cup.
Having appeared sporadically for Stevenage during the first half of the season, N'Gala joined Barnet on a one-month loan deal on 15 February 2013, in order to regain his match fitness. He made his debut a day later as an 80th minute substitute for Chiró N'Toko in a 2–1 away win at York City, but was stretchered off with a head injury just a few minutes later. The injury required "a few stitches", but he returned to first-team action for Barnet's next game a week later, playing the whole match as Barnet kept a clean sheet in a draw with Rochdale. N'Gala went on to make six appearances during the brief loan spell, before being recalled by Stevenage on 13 March, due to injuries and suspensions within the first-team squad. On his return to his parent club, N'Gala played the whole match in Stevenage's 4–0 home victory over Sheffield United, helping the side keep an important clean sheet. He ended the season playing regularly in central defence, and made 28 appearances for Stevenage during the season. Despite his return to the first-team towards the end of the campaign, Stevenage opted against taking up the option of another year on N'Gala's contract, and he left the club when his contract expired in May 2013.
Portsmouth.
On 2 August 2013, N'Gala signed a one-month deal with Portsmouth, extending this until January on 29 August. He made his debut in a League Cup defeat to Championship side Bournemouth, he scored his first goal in over two years and first goal for Pompey with a header from a Ricky Holmes corner on 5 October 2013, it came against Rochdale, he netted in the 52nd minute and then scored a second again from a Holmes corner just 14 minutes later, the match ended 3–0 to Pompey.
Personal life.
N'Gala was born in Forest Gate, London. He is of Congolese descent. N'Gala supports West Ham United, and has done from a young age. He has stated that he has always aspired to play like Ledley King.

Narasingha Mishra

Narasingha Mishra (Oriya: ନରସିଂହ ମିଶ୍ର ; born 23 December 1940) is a politician from Odisha, India. He was a Member of Odisha Legislative Assembly and was the Deputy Leader of the Congress Legislature Party from 2004-2009. He was first elected to the assembly in 1990 and served as the Law Minister. He last represented Loisingha constituency from the Indian National Congress party.
Background.
Narasingha Mishra (Narsing Mishra/Narasingh Mishra) comes from the small village of Chhatamakhna near Balangir in Odisha.
His father, Yudhisthir Mishra, was a lawyer and a member of the Constituent assembly of India. 
Born into a family where politics was a part and parcel of the daily life, he joined politics at the age of 18 and was enrolled as a member of the Communist Party of India and continued as such until 1993. During that period, he held many party positions and successfully led several agitations.
He has had a very successful practice as a lawyer. Except for the period when he was a minister he has remained in active practice.
Notable amongst his achievements for public cause as a lawyer was, the Orissa High Court directive to state govt. for direct procurement of paddy from farmers.[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/orissa-resists-demand-for-direct-paddy-purchase-from-farmers/50194/]
Political career.
Although he joined the state legislature only in 1990, he was considered to be a power centre in Balangir for a long time. He is said to be the mentor of many present and former public representatives from the region and this probably makes him a potent force irrespective of the party he represents.
He was first elected to the Odisha Assembly from Loisingha under the Bolangir (Lok Sabha constituency) and joined the cabinet as the Minister of Law. One of his major contributions as a minister was the Special Courts Bill, with which Odisha aimed to fight corruption in high places.
In 1995, he was elected from the Binika assembly constituency and was made the chairman of Western Odisha Development Council (WODC). As chairman of WODC he had initiated the establishment of a medical college and hospital in Balangir.
After losing the 2000 elections he fought back from Luisinga in 2004 and is the Deputy Leader of Congress Legislature Party in Odisha assembly.
He lost the Parliamentary elections from the Balangir Parliamentary Constituency in 2009. He is currently a part-time member of the Law commission of India.

It has been said that her mother inspired Bryant’s creativity, and that her father taught her how to successfully navigate the professional world (Archive of American Television). She grew up with three siblings: an older sister and brother (Laura Bryant, and Paul Edwin Bryant III) as well as a younger sister (Anne Bryant). While growing up, Bryant was most interested in playing dress up (while creating different characters through costume), singing, dancing (ballet), and designing clothes for her dolls and Barbies. Bryant designed her first dress when she was 8 years old. It was, a sundress with blue and white stripes, a crisscross strap in the back, and white anchor buttons in the front.  She wore it to her third grade class, but none of her classmates believed her when she told them she had made it. From a nearly age Bryant became obsessed with old movies, such as Gone with the Wind, The Sound of Music, Ten Commandments, and The Wizard of Oz (Archive of AmericanTelevision, Janie Bryant official website). She claims that much of her inspiration throughout her career has stemmed from this obsession for old films. She also enjoyed television shows such as the Partridge Family, the Brady Bunch, Father Knows Best, My Three Sons, Bewitched, and Get Smart(Archive of American Television).
High School and College Education.
Bryant attended Cleveland High School for two years before transferring to Brenau Academy for the rest of her high school education. Brenau Academy is a grades 9-12 college preparatory school,dedicated to preparing young women for a college-education. Brenau maintained an all female student body until 2012. Throughout high school she maintained a strong focus on art, painting, and illustration, and believed she was going to pursue a career as an artist or a businesswoman. Unsure of what she wanted todo with her life, and feeling pressure from her family to pursue a career in business, she attended college of Charleston for a summer before transferring to her high school’s all women college, Brenau University. She attended Brenau for a year before transferring to Georgia State University for another year,and then transferred once again (without her parents knowledge) to the America college of Applied Arts. She finished her college education here while studying fashion design.
Career.
After finishing college, she moved to Paris and then to New York, where she learned the craft from designer John Scher. After meeting a costume designer at a party, Bryant found her calling and began to work on movies and commercials in Manhattan.
After some independent work, including a Nick at Nite commercial, Bryant's career grew through work with David Milch series Big Apple, which led to work on his Deadwood series that ran on HBO. It was her work with Deadwood that later led to an interview for Mad Men with the series creator Matthew Weiner. She has been nominated for three Emmys for her costume design on Mad Men.
Mad Men-inspired collections popped up all over runways in 2008 and designers including Michael Kors, Prada and Vera Wang have cited Bryant or the shows on which she worked as key influences. She is credited with a huge role in bringing vintage (and vintage-inspired) pieces to contemporary clothing. Her work on Mad Men has also led to partnerships with Brooks Brothers (a limited-edition "Mad Men" suit) and Banana Republic's "Back to Work" line.
For Bryant's own influences, she relies not only on others designers with whom she has worked, and research into the periods, but also real life people who she sees in the characters. For example, Grace Kelly in Betty Draper. Among the key elements essential to recreating the 1960s look in the show's cast are foundation garments, which then led to a partnership with Maidenform.

South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology

South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology (; ) is a specialist archaeological museum in the city of Bolzano, the capital of South Tyrol, northern Italy. It is the home of the preserved body of Ötzi the Iceman.
History.
The museum was specifically established in 1998 to house "Ötzi", a well-preserved natural mummy of a man from about 3300 BC (53 centuries ago). This is the world's oldest natural human mummy, a wet mummy, as opposed to mummies preserved by dry conditions in a desert environment.It has offered an unprecedented view of Chalcolithic (Copper Age) European culture.
The world's oldest complete copper age axe was found among his extensive equipment which also comprised a rather complex fire lighting kit and a quiver loaded with twelve arrows, only two of which were finished, clothing and a flint knife complete with its sheath.
The body is held in a climate controlled chamber within the museum at a temperature of -6 Celsius and 98% humidity, replicating glacier conditions in which it was found. Along with original finds there are models, reconstructions and multimedia presentations showing Ötzi in the context of the early history of the southern Alpine region.
Converted from a 19th-century bank building, the museum covers the history and archaeology of the southern Alpine region from the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic (15,000 B.C.) up to 800 A.D. In 2006 the museum hosted an exhibition on the mummies of the Chachapoyas culture.

Dion Williams

Brigadier General Dion Williams (December 15, 1869 – December 11, 1952) was an officer in the United States Marine Corps. He was the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps from August 1, 1925 — July 1, 1928. During his early career, Williams pioneered the first conceptual study of amphibious reconnaissance in the United States and becoming one of the strongest advocates in having the Marine Corps assume the amphibious, expeditionary role. During his career, he fought guerrillas in the Philippines and Dominican Republic during the Spanish–American War.
Williams is credited in the persuasion of Admiral Dewey in 1907 to assert Congress that "a force of 5,000 Marines with a Fleet" would have ensued the Philippine–American War following the Spanish defeat. This 'force' was the first of the doctrinal sequence of the establishment of the Advanced Base Force, its titulage American Expeditionary Force and subsequently its modern namesake, Fleet Marine Force.
Williams retired from the Marine Corps in 1934, spending the rest of his life in Maryland.
Biography.
Dion Williams was born in Williamsburg, Ohio on December 15, 1869.
He graduated from the United States Naval Academy where he received his early education until entering the Naval Academy and graduated on June 30, 1891.
After completing the required 2-year sea duty aboard the USS "Atlanta" as a midshipman for two years, he was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps on July 1, 1893 and attended the School of Application before he served at the Marine Barracks, New York and the Marine Barracks, Mare Island until 1897.
He was married to Helen Mar Ames on February 20, 1895.
He participated in the Battle of Manila Bay while serving aboard the USS "Baltimore"' on May 1, 1898 under Admiral George Dewey. Lt. Williams landed a company of Marines at a Spanish naval arsenal yard at Cavite in the Philippine Islands, securing the naval station, and hoisting the first American flag raised over Spanish soil in the Spanish–American War.
Williams served duty at Marine Barracks, Charlston before being called out for a minor revolt in Panama 1902 to command a detachment of Marines sent to disarm Colombian troops threatening the Americans.
He continued serving two more years in various engagements of the Philippine–American War after which he served as Fleet Marine Officer of the Atlantic Fleet from 1902-04.
In March 1905, Major Williams reported to the Naval War College for two years. By 1906, Williams wrote a study, "Naval Reconnaissance, Instructions for the Reconnaissance of Bays, Harbors, and Adjacent Country," which eventually became the first doctrine in United States' history concerning the pertinent missions of amphibious reconnaissance. He focused primarily on the establishment and employment of an assault force specialized in conducting preassault reconnaissance. Many of the reconnaissance ideas advanced in his studies surpassed and were eventually incorporated in the "Tentative Manual for Landing Operations" developed in 1934.
He was assigned the Fleet Marine Officer of the United States Fleet from 1907-09 until after his tour of duty with the staff of the Office of Naval Intelligence from 1909-12.
He commanded the American Legation Guard at Peking, China (1912–15) and then became the Marine Corps' representative to the General Board of the Navy from 1915–18, before being assigned as the commanding officer of 10th Marine Regiment at MCB Quantico where he remained to prepare his regiment for combat duty in France during World War I, 1917-18.
Afterwards, Williams became the commanding officer of 2nd Provisional Marine Brigade for pacification duty in the Dominican Republic. Returning to MCB Quantico in 1921, he assumed command of the 4th Marine Brigade as part of the East Coast Expeditionary Force participating in the ongoing advanced base exercises held by the Navy's North Atlantic Fleet on Culebra.
During the 1924 Winter Maneuvers, he witnessed the first use of an experimental 'amphibious' tank being mounted a 75-mm gun, as well as the "beetle boats" uses as amphibious transports.
After his tour of duty with the 4th Brigade ended, Williams became assistant to the Marine Commandant in 1928. General Williams was in command of the Marine Occupation Force in Nicaragua from April 1929 through 1930. He became editor of the "Marine Corps Gazette" while he remained on duty at Headquarters Marine Corps until his retirement on January 1, 1934.
Despite his retirement, Williams remained active, authoring several articles on officer professional education and the curriculum at Marine Corps Schools, and participating in Marine Corps affairs. In January 1942, he participated in a ceremony at Annapolis, Maryland, where the same flag is now enshrined. It was just after evacuation of the Cavite Naval Base to the Japanese.
Williams died on December 11, 1952 at the age of 82, a few days before his birthday, after an illness of several months at the Naval Medical Center at nearby Bethesda, Maryland near the District of Columbia. Brigadier General Williams was buried with full military honors on December 15, 2008 in Arlington National Cemetery; and was survived by his widow, Helen.

Bell River (South Africa)

The Bell River is a river that drains the Drakensberg uplands of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Its drainage basin, a part of the headwaters of the Orange River, is approximately in extent, ranging from an altitude of 1,720 m (a.m.s.l) to 3,001m. The river's source near the Lesotho border () to the north of the high pass Naudésnek. Downstream it passes the town of Rhodes, to eventually form a tributary of the Kraai River some 40 km (direct) from its source. In fact the Bell River and the Sterkspruit, become the Kraai River northeast of Moshesh's Ford () flowing further west towards Aliwal North, where it joins the Orange River ().
The river has a strong population of rainbow trout. The Bell's Wild Trout Festival is based in the town of Rhodes and is organised by the Wild Trout Association. Up to 80 participants fish for three days on 180 km of running water which is within an hour's drive of the village.
The catchment area has been used extensively for grazing by commercial farmers since the 1870s. Consequently the river's water quality and channel stability is affected by increased sediment loading from widespread gully erosion in the catchment area. As a remedy, Willow species of the "Salix" family, in particular "Salix caprea", have been planted along the banks in an effort to prevent further channel shifting in the form of meander cutoffs.

In Maharashtra, the Bhois originally lived in Mumbai, Nashik, Dhulia, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Pune, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri and Sholapur districts of Maharshtra. Presently, the members of the Bhoi community have spread over whole Maharashtra. After independence of India in 1947, they have been included in the list of the Nomadic tribes in Maharashtra. The total 22 sub-groups of the community speak in Ahirani language in the family and within kin groups but speak in Marathi, while talking to the others. They had migrated to Mumbai from Rajasthan during the 13th century during the reign of Raja Bhimdev.
In Maharastra, the Bhois were the palanquin bearers or doli carriers. There are altogether 22 sub-groups namely Zinga Bhoi, Pardesh Bhoi, Raj bhoi, Kahar Bhoi, Gadia Bhoi, Dhuria Kahar Bhoi, Kirat Machwa Bhoi, Hanzi, Jati, Kewat, Dhiwar, Dingar, palewar, Macchindra,Havadi, Halhar, Gadhav Bhoi, Khodi Bhoi, Khare Bhoi and Devra.

Etymology.
The name is supposed to be a Telugu word, derived from Boya or Boyar caste but this derivation appears to be fictitious and has probably been suggested because of the similarities between the names "Bhoi", "Bhovi" and "Boya".

Ben-Hadad I (Hebrew בן הדד "BeN HaDaD", Aramaic: בר חדד, "Bar-Hadad") was the king of Aram Damascus between 885 BC and 865 BC. He was the son of Tabrimmon and grandson of Hezion and a contemporary of Kings Baasha and Ahab of Israel and Asa of Judah. Asa called on Ben-Hadad I to aid him in attacking northern Israel while Baasha was restricting access to Jerusalem through border fortifications. The plan worked for Asa as Ben-Hadad took the towns of "Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maachah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali" (1 Kings 15:20). This acquisition gave Damascus control of the trade route to southern Phoenicia. By the reign of Ahab the area was back in Israelite hands.

Knowsley United was an English football club based in the town of Huyton, Knowsley Merseyside. Originally named Kirkby Town they folded in 1997.
History.
Kirkby Town joined the Second Division of the Lancashire Combination in 1963. In 1966–67 they won the division, and were promoted to the First Division. In 1969–70 they finished fourth, and were promoted to the Northern Premier League. In the same season they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, but lost 6–0 at Bangor City. However, after finishing bottom of the Northern Premier League in 1971–72, they returned to the Lancashire Combination.
In 1978 the club switched to Division Two of the Cheshire County League. They finished third in 1979–80, and were promoted to Division One. However, they were immediately relegated back to Division Two after finishing 19th.
In 1982 they switched leagues again, joining the Third Division of the new North West Counties League. They won the division at the first attempt, and were promoted to Division Two, which they also won at the first attempt, resulting in promotion to Division One for the 1986–87 season.
In 1988 they changed their name to Knowsley United in an attempt to attract further support. After two second-placed finishes, the club won the league in 1990–91 and were promoted to Division One of the Northern Premier League. In 1992–93 they finished as runners-up, and were promoted to the Premier Division. The following season they reached the first round of the FA Cup for a second time, where they lost 4–1 at home to Carlisle United. The club folded in 1997.
Stadium.
Kirkby Town played their home games at Simonswood Lane and later Kirkby Sports Centre. Upon becoming Knowsley United, they relocated to Alt Park in Huyton which was previously used by Huyton RLFC from 1969 to 1984.
Although by the time Huyton RLFC had vacated Alt Park the ground had become subject to vandalism and general disrepair, after Knowlsey United moved into Alt Park the ground underwent a series of renovations thanks largely to the involvement of the Orr family, who were the footballing proprietors of Kirkby Town FC and also the people responsible for the team's relocation to Huyton with Roby. Due to the initial success of Knowlsey United floodlights were installed and with the help of Knowsley Borough Council the clubhouse, grandstand & social club were recommissioned & upgraded as well. Alt Park was transformed into a respectable ground for a club the size of Knowsley United.

<doc id="20356069" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20356069" title="The Flying Girl">
The Flying Girl

The Flying Girl is a novel written by L. Frank Baum, author of the Oz books. It was first published in 1911. In the book, Baum pursued an innovative blending of genres to create a feminist adventure melodrama. The book was followed by a sequel, The Flying Girl and Her Chum, published the next year, 1912. Both books were illustrated by Joseph Pierre Nuyttens, the artist who also illustrated Baum's "Annabel" and "Phoebe Daring" in 1912.
As with Baum's other books for girls, these two novels were published under the pseudonym "Edith Van Dyne."
Feminism.
Baum lived during an era of increasing feminist and suffragette agitation; women gained the right to vote with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, the year after his death. Baum's mother-in-law Matilda Joslyn Gage was a leading feminist of her generation, and influenced Baum's views.
It is certainly true that Baum pokes gentle fun at the feminist and suffragette movement in his books — the most obvious example being General Jinjur and her Army of Revolt in "The Marvelous Land of Oz". Yet Baum also had a strong sympathy with the broad goals of the movement, a sympathy that is reflected in his literary canon. Oz, of course, is a female-dominated society, with Princess Ozma, Glinda, and witches good and bad. Baum wrote a number of books specifically for girls; his ten-novel series "Aunt Jane's Nieces" portrays young women acting with independence, initiative, and individuality in preference to traditional gender roles. In one case, Baum went too far for his publishers: though he was their star writer, Reilly & Britton rejected the first version of his 1916 book "Mary Louise", "presumably because the heroine was not sufficiently idealized." Though unhappy with their decision, Baum re-wrote the book to deliver a more tame and stereotypical heroine.
Technology.
Dr. Edwin P. Ryland, a Methodist minister and a personal friend of Baum, maintained that if Baum had not pursued his vocation of writing for children "he might have been one of the country's best known technical writers for he had a strong leaning toward technical matters." Many critics who have written about Baum and Oz have noted that Baum's is a technology-friendly fantasy realm, which sets it apart from the more traditional fantasies that preceded it. Baum's Oz books and other works reveal commonalities with science fiction ("The Master Key") and utopian fiction; they contain mechanical men (the Tin Woodman and Tik-Tok), a planned metropolis (the Emerald City), a domed submersible city and miniature submarines (in "Glinda of Oz"), and similar features.
Baum's "Flying Girl" books provide a dramatic and blatant display of this technological bent. The first book opens with a Foreword in which Baum thanks Wilbur Wright and Glenn Curtiss "for curtesies extended during the preparation of this manuscript." Curtiss and the Wright Brothers appear briefly in the book, along with other early "aeronauts" like Walter Brookins and Arch Hoxsey. Baum's treatment of heavier-than-air powered flight through both books is strongly affirmative.
Quimby.
Baum's aviatrix character Orissa Kane had a real-life counterpart. Harriet Quimby arose to notoriety in the same year as the first "Flying Girl" book appeared. Yet Baum's book appears to have been written before he could have been influenced by Quimby's brief career (she died in a crash in 1912). The coincidence of the actual Quimby and the fictional Orissa Kane seems to have been nothing more than that — coincidence.
"The Flying Girl".
The first novel tells the story of Orissa Kane, the sister of a young man who is building his own flying machine. The 17-year-old Orissa provides financial support for her brother Stephen Kane and their blind mother through her office job, while Steve concentrates on his invention. She also supports Steve's work emotionally, urging him forward. The story involves commercial and technical competition, and sabotage by a competitor. When Steve suffers a broken leg in a crash and cannot fly, Orissa takes his place to prove the validity of his aircraft, demonstrating her own courage and competence in the process. She wins the top prize in an aerial exhibition and gets a boyfriend too, without ever losing "her humble and unassuming manner" and her other maidenly virtues. (Baum was simultaneously writing a similar story, of a brave girl defending her brother's interests, in his 1911 novel "The Daring Twins".)
Her brother Steve supports her decision to fly, in the bold spirit characteristic of the new field of aviation. In Chapter 19 he says, "The most successful aviators in the future...are bound to be women. As a rule they are lighter than men, more supple and active, quick of perception and less liable to lose their heads in emergencies. The operation of an aeroplane is, it seems to me, especially fitted to women." (No traditionalist or male chauvinist would have written that women are "less liable to lose their heads" in an emergency than men.)
"...and Her Chum".
In the sequel, instrument trouble in Steve's new hydroplane forces Orissa and her friend and passenger Sybil to set down on a remote island. (Baum would structure a similar story, of two girls adventuring, in his final Oz book, "Glinda of Oz", later in the decade.) The second novel is less an aviation tale and more of a straight adventure story than its predecessor. Baum's publisher Sumner C. Britton had the author tone down the book, telling him by letter, "You have made the story too thrilling..." for a (supposedly) female author and her fans.
Later editions.
The "Flying Girl" books were not as popular in their day as the other "Edith Van Dyne" novels; they went out of print with their first editions and were not reprinted for eight decades. Baum's publishers apparently knew their market well, and made a valid judgement, on the purely commercial level, in discouraging Baum from creating heroines more independent than his audience would accept.
"The Flying Girl" resurfaced in "Oz-story Magazine" in 1997, with new illustrations by Eric Shanower. Its sequel, "The Flying Girl and Her Chum", was issued by Hungry Tiger Press in a separate edition the same year, with Nuyttens's original pictures.

It was part of a 200 acre farm divided from larger parcels patented by the Dorsey family. The design reflects the transition between the Greek Revival and Italianate architecture styles. The home is associated with Henry Howard Owings, a prominent Howard County landowner and farmer, who also served as a judge of the Orphan's Court for Howard County. Owings purchased the property in 1858 and died at Woodlawn in 1869. The former tobacco farm produced corn, oats, hay, and pork. The majority of the property surrounding Woodland and it's slave quarters were subdivided by 1966 and purchased by Howard Research and Development for the planned community development Columbia, Maryland, leaving only 5 acres surrounded by multiple lots intended for development of an Oakland Ridge industrial center and equestrian center. The summer kitchen, smoke house, corn crib and stable built about 1830 have been replaced by a parking lot. 
In 2003, Preservation Howard County appealed to the Columbia Association to restore the adjacent stone slave quarters building predating the 1789 Woodlawn house. In 2004 the property surrounding the Woodlawn manor was rezoned from residential to dense office use. All of the 200 year old trees surrounding the property were declared diseased by the developer-owner and cut down. In June 2006, Developer Ron Brasher submitted plans to build a 71,705sf office building adjacent to Woodlawn with a parking lot surrounding the building on all sides. The project was temporarily delayed due to lack of road access and requests for reduced setbacks. The planning and zoning director cited the developer's efforts to restore and lease the 5000sf mansion for office space or a "condo opportunity" as a way to preserve the manor recently rezoned by the department. In August 2007 the Columbia Association purchased the slave quarters property and approved another $125,000 for restoration with the construction of the office project pending.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

His professional kickboxing career spanned 18 years, where he became a 7-time, undefeated world champion, and in 1998 became the first inductee into the ISKA Hall of Fame. Cunningham got the nickname "Sugarfoot" because of his extremely fast and technical kicking abilities. He also incorporated boxing hand techniques, defense and footwork into his style, and held a 10-4 record as a professional in that sport.
Cunningham retired from kickboxing, with a record of 50-0-1 record, 21 KO's, after defeating Dida Diafat (in a rematch) in June 1996, by decision, in Paris, France.
Peter Cunningham authored the definitive kickboxing training manual, "Civilized Warring: Fundamental Kickboxing Techniques" (with Robert Mickey) in 1996.
When opportunities in kickboxing started to become scarce in the mid-1980s, Peter made the transition into working as an actor in both film and television. In his first role, Cunningham (as lightweight champion fighter "Frank Peters") faced off with action star Jean-Claude Van Damme in the 1985 martial arts film, "No Retreat, No Surrender". He was also featured in the 1986 Yuen Biao/Corey Yuen film "Righting Wrongs".

George Washington Parke Custis Peter, who was the second son of Martha Parke Custis Peter of Tudor Place, Georgetown. She attended the famed Patapsco Female Institute and was a leading society member in Maryland. She was a cousin of Robert E. Lee's wife and his children spent many summers here after his death. Gabriella was known to be gracious but demanding. She initially lived at nearby Grey Rock but refused to stay there long as her husband had shared that home with his first wife. Her daughters were unable to leave her side during her lifetime, especially after the accidental 1903 death of her youngest son, Parke Custis, rendering them middle-aged spinsters at the time of her death.
The Mackubins raised five children here:
The property was sold after the death of Emily Mackubin in 1946 and subsequently subdivided into the present neighborhood. The family is buried at nearby St. John's Church where they were active members.

The Willows (story)

"The Willows" is one of Algernon Blackwood's best known short stories. American horror author H.P. Lovecraft considered it to be the finest supernatural tale in English literature. "The Willows" is an example of early modern horror and is connected within the literary tradition of weird fiction.
Plot summary.
Two friends are midway on a canoe trip down the Danube River. Throughout the story Blackwood personifies the surrounding environment—river, sun, wind—and imbues them with a powerful and ultimately threatening character. Most ominous are the masses of dense, desultory, menacing willows, which "moved of their own will as though alive, and they touched, by some incalculable method, my own keen sense of the horrible." Just after managing to land their canoe for the evening on the shifting, sandy islands just downstream across the Austria/Hungary frontier, the main character reflects on the river's potency, human qualities and will:
Sleepy at first, but later developing violent desires as it became conscious of its deep soul, it rolled, like some huge fluid being, through all the countries we had passed, holding our little craft on its mighty shoulders, playing roughly with us sometimes, yet always friendly and well-meaning, till at length we had come inevitably to regard it as a Great Personage.
Blackwood also specifically characterizes the silvery, windblown willows as sinister:
And, apart quite from the elements, the willows connected themselves subtly with my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow by reason of their vast numbers, and contriving in some way or other to represent to the imagination a new and mighty power, a power, moreover, not altogether friendly to us.
At one point the two men see a man in a "flat-bottomed boat". However, the man appears to be warning the two, and ultimately crosses himself before hurtling forward on the river, out of sight. During the night and into the next day and night, the mysterious, hostile forces emerge in force, including large, dark shapes that seem to trace the consciousness of the two men, tapping sounds outside their tent, shifting gong-like sounds, and the appearance that the willows have changed location. In the morning the two discover that one of their two paddles is missing, there is a slit in the canoe that needs repair, and some of their food has disappeared. A hint of distrust arises between them. The howling wind dies down on the second day and night, and humming calm ensues. During the second night, the second man, the Swede, attempts to hurl himself into the river as a "sacrifice," "going inside to Them," but he is saved by the first character. The next morning, the Swede claims that the mysterious forces have found another sacrifice that may save them. They find the corpse of a peasant lodged in roots near the shore. When they touch the body, a flurry of living presence seems to rise from it and disappear into the sky, and later they see the body is pockmarked with funnel shapes as had been formed on the sands of the island during their experience. These are "Their awful mark!" the Swede says. The body is swept away, resembling an "otter" they thought they had seen the previous day, and the story ends. 
The precise nature of the mysterious entities in "The Willows" is unclear, and they appear at times malevolent and treacherous, and at times simply mystical, almost divine: "a new order of experience, and in the true sense of the word unearthly," and a world "where great things go on unceasingly...vast purposes...that deal directly with the soul, and not indirectly with mere expressions of the soul." These forces are also often contrasted with the fantastic natural beauty of the locale, itself a vigorous dynamic. In sum the story suggests that the landscape is an intersection, a point of contact with a "fourth dimension" — "on the frontier of another world, an alien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of willows."

William Nicolay

Lieutenant General Sir William Nicolay KCH, CB was the third son of Frederick de Nicolay, Principal Page to Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III. He was born at St. James's Palace on 14 April 1771 and was a member of the British branch of the Nicolay family. 
He entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a cadet 1 Nov. 1785, but did not obtain a commission as Second Lieutenant Royal Artillery until 28 May 1790. In April 1791 he embarked for India with two newly formed companies of Royal Artillery, known as the ‘East India Detachment,’ which subsequently formed the nucleus of the old sixth battalion (Duncan, Hist. Roy. Artillery, ii. 2). 
He served under Lord Cornwallis at the siege of Seringapatam in 1792, and was an Assistant Engineer at the reduction of Pondicherry in 1793. Meanwhile, with some other artillery subalterns, he had been transferred in November 1792 to the Royal Engineers, in which he became First Lieutenant on 15 August 1793 and Captain on 29 August 1798. He was present at the capture of Saint Lucia, and was left there as Commanding Engineer by Sir John Moore. He afterwards served under Sir Ralph Abercromby at Tobago and Trinidad until compelled to return home by a broken thigh, which incapacitated him for duty for two years. 
When the Royal Staff Corps was formed, to provide a corps for Quartermaster General's and engineer duties which should be under the horse guards (instead of under the ordnance), Nicolay was appointed Major of the new corps from 26 June 1801, and on 4 April 1805 became Lieutenant Colonel. He was employed on the defences of the Kent and Sussex coasts during the invasion alarms of 1804–5, and on intelligence duties under Sir John Moore in Spain in 1808, and was present at Corunna. 
He became a Brevet Colonel 4 June 1813 and in 1815 he proceeded to Belgium in command of five companies of the Royal Staff Corps, and was present at the Battle of Waterloo (C.B. and medal) and the occupation of Paris. There he remained until the division destined to occupy the frontier, of which the Staff Corps formed part, moved to Cambray. He became a Major General on 12 August 1819. 
He was governor of Dominica from April 1824 to July 1831, of St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua, and the Virgin Islands from January 1831 to December 1832, and of Mauritius from 1832 to February 1840, an anxious time, as, owing to the recent abolition of slavery and other causes, there was much ill-feeling in the island towards the English.
Nicolay, a C.B. and K.C.H., was promoted to Lieutenant General on 10 January 1837, and was appointed Colonel, 1st West India regiment, 30 Nov. 1839. He died at his residence, Oriel Lodge, Cheltenham, on 3 May 1842. He married in 1806 the second daughter of the Rev. E. Law of Whittingham, Northumberland.

Our Farewell

"Our Farewell" is the first single of the Netherlands symphonic metal/rock band Within Temptation from their second studio album Mother Earth. Although the song was released as a single, it never entered the charts, just like their previous single, "Restless" . There was also no promotional video made for the single.
A live recording of the song is on the "Mother Earth Tour" DVD, in which the song is performed as a duet with Dutch opera singer Gea Gijsbertsen [http://www.gunrecords.de/content/artist/withintemptation/bio.htm], who also conducted the choirs for Within Temptation's special gig at the Broerenkerk, Zwolle during the Mother Earth Tour.
After the release of the album The Silent Force, the song was still played live at some concerts [http://luna.stella.free.fr/images/setlist%20bxl%2013112004.jpg], during the Sanctuary Tour (2012), and during their 15 years birthday live, Elements.
This song has been, among 2 of Van Canto's songs ("Water, Fire, Heaven, Earth" & "Hearted"), the inspiration for "Forevermore", a song by the Dutch symphonic metal band EPICA, featuring the mild-autistic Ruurd Woltring. The recording of this song was made possible thanks to the Dutch TV-show "Niks te gek" (Nothing too crazy), in which mentally disabled people get their wishes granted.

Palomares is an agricultural, fishing and tourist village on the Mediterranean Sea in the Almería province of Andalucia, Spain. It is about above sea level. The village falls within the municipality of Cuevas del Almanzora.
The ruins of "El Artial" lie just outside the village.
1966 B-52 crash.
The town is noted for an incident in 1966 where a B-52 Stratofortress of Strategic Air Command crashed, causing radiation contamination after its payload of nuclear bombs was ruptured. There were four thermonuclear bombs in the plane. The high-explosive igniters on two bombs detonated on impact, spreading radioactive material, including plutonium, over a wide area of the Spanish countryside. A third bomb landed relatively intact and was recovered. The fourth bomb landed in the Mediterranean Sea, and U.S. military searchers took months to find and recover the device intact. In 2001 CIEMAT detected higher levels of plutonium, uranium and americium than average over of Palomares.
Annual monitoring by the US and Spain have found no evidence of health problems or contaminated food or water from the crash. Nevertheless, some areas remain contaminated and cannot be disturbed; although they are safely fenced off, the result is that the town is blighted, and has missed out on developments like those in most other coastal towns. , Spain is asking the United States to finish cleaning up the area.

Aprilia RSV 250

The Aprilia RSV 250 is a race motorcycle manufactured by Aprilia to race in the Grand Prix motorcycle World Championship. It was debuted in ; in its history it underwent several modifications and upgrades, which brought it to its most recent incarnation (the RSA 250). Since its inception, the bike won ten World Championships (one as Gilera, which uses rebranded Aprilia bikes) making it one of the most successful racing bikes of its category.
1991-2007: RSV and RSW.
From 1991 to 2007 the bike was used in two different configurations: first the original RSV, then the RSW, a new version of the RSV. Despite being an outdated bike, the RSW version still races as a customer bike with some upgrades from the new RSA, under the RSW 250 LE name.
Initially the front braking system was available either with 273mm carbon discs or in 300mm carbon steel, then from 1994 onwards the only version used was the double carbon disc, either with 255mm or 273mm length. The rear braking system has always been one-disc carbon steel, initially at 184mm, then from 1996 at 190mm.
2007-present: RSA.
In 2007 the bike was made available in a new version, which was amended the acronym RSA. It is characterized by many different details than the previous model, including the revised intake system and the new disposition of the gear unit and of thermal groups. Also, the measures of the frame changed to be able to use a longer swingarm, and obtain benefits both in acceleration and traction. Another novelty is the use of three accelerometers to get more data for the management of the power of motion in situations of low adhesion in order to speed up the development of Aprilia RSV 4 which will enter the Superbike World Championship in 2009.
The new engine is more powerful and with a wider operational period, but requires either having to stay at least at 6,000 rpm to work properly, and at 13,500 rpm in order to generate the maximum power.
The RSA (and the "evolution" version of the RSW) are used not only by Aprilia, but also by Gilera and Derbi (rebranded as such), since all three brands belong to the Piaggio group.

Bill Carson (sportsman)

William Nicol Carson (16 July 1916 – 8 October 1944) was a sportsman who represented New Zealand at both cricket and rugby union.
Cricket.
Carson, an aggressive left-handed batsman and useful fast-medium bowler, started his cricketing career with a couple of large scores for Auckland in the Plunket Shield. In just his second innings of first-class cricket and second match, Carson scored 290 against Otage at Carisbrook, as part of a 445 run partnership with Paul Whitelaw. The pair created a world record for the third wicket in first-class cricket. In his very next match, against Wellington at Eden Park, Carson made 194, giving him an aggregate of 496 runs and an average of 165.33 after three innings.
His performances with Auckland earned him a call up to the national side for their tour of England in 1937. Although he played 24 matches, all but four of them first-class fixtures, Carson wasn't able to break into the Test side which took on England. He had started the tour well, with 85 runs against Surrey and 86 versus Northamptonshire but he failed to contribute substantial scores in most matches. Carson finished the summer with 627 runs at 19.00.
Rugby.
When Carson returned to New Zealand he focused on rugby, playing provincially with Auckland and for the North Island representative team as a flanker. Like with his cricket career, he represented his country at rugby without appearing at Test level. He made his All Blacks debut on 20 July 1938 for a game against the Combined Western Districts. Carson then joined the New Zealand camp for a tour of Australia and played matches against Newcastle and the ACT.
World War II.
Carson embarked on war duty in 1940 and went on to participate in the Crete, North African and Italian campaigns. While serving in Italy with the 5th Field Regiment of the NZ Artillery, as a Major, Carson was severely wounded in battle. He was evacuated but died aboard a boat from Bari, Italy to Egypt. A distinguished soldier, Carson had won a Military Cross during the World War II conflict.

Waverly (Marriottsville, Maryland)

Waverly, or Waverley, is a historic home located at Marriottsville in Howard County, Maryland, USA. It was built between 1756 and 1800 by different accounts. It is a -story stone house, covered with stucco, with extensions completed about 1900. Also on the property are a small -story stone dwelling, a supposed combination storehouse and slave jail, a 2-story frame-and-stone corn crib, and the ruins of a log slave quarter. It was a property developed on land first patented by Charles Carroll of Carrollton and later part of the 1703 survey "Ranter's Ridge" owned by Thomas Browne. The land was resurveyed in 1726 as "The Mistake". Nathan Browne inherited half of the land in 1756. It was purchased by John Dorsey and willed to Nathan and Sophia Dorsey as the next owners by 1760. 650 acres were sold to, but not occupied by General John Eager Howard, Governor of Maryland from 1788 to 1791. Parcels were added to "the Mistake" totalling 1,313 acres and deeded in 1811 to his son, George Howard, who served as Governor of Maryland from 1831 to 1833. The slave plantation was renamed Waverley, after a 1814 novel, "Waverley (novel)" by Walter Scott. There is a tombstone onsite for George Howard's son John Eager Howard named after his grandfather dated 1838.
In 1854 297.5 acres of the Waverley estate patented as "Delaware Bottom" were sold by William Howard. He descibed the land containing for a lime quarry, and lime kiln as "heavily timbered without improvements and suitable for wheat and corn".
Other owners included Joeseph Judick in 1863 and the Brosennes family until 1950. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The property was purchased by Larry Realty and subdivided from 279 acres down to 25.2 acres, then to 9.8 acres and again to 3.4 acres which were donated in 1975 to the Society for the Preservation of Maryland Antiques. In 1976 The State of Maeyland funded $150,000 followed by $150,000 in federal matching money in 1978 for a restoration. In 1981 The Maryland Historical trust donated $32,000 to complete the restoration. Historic Waverly, Inc. was formed in 1985 to operated the facility for meetings and receptions. The property was donated in 1989 to Howard County.
In 1991, 682 acres of the original estate was developed by Donald R Reuwer Jr company Land Design and Development as Waverly Woods. he was quoted in the Baltimore Sun at the onset, "If we were pure, greedy developers, the simplest thing for us to do would be to forget the Planned Employment Center and do it as residential. But that would blow the only water-sewer commercial site in the Frederick-Baltimore corridor -- 6,500 (potential) jobs." In 1993, the zoning board later removed 41 percentof the commercial space requirements for the project. Former planning and zoning director Joe Rutter joined Land Design and Development, winnng approval from his former deputy in 2012 to convert Planned Employment Centers into denser age restricted housing units.
The Howard County Public School System named Waverly Elementary School after the plantation.

Jonathan Rosenbaum of "Monthly Film Bulletin" praised Denys Coop's camerawork and the acting performances, yet felt the film never quite realised its potential. A. H. Weiler reviewing the work in "The New York Times" commended Cushing's contribution, deeming it superior to the rest of the cast's, although considered its plot contrived. Mark Burger, reviewing a home video release for the "Winston-Salem Journal" in 2002, similarly noted the strong cast though found the muddled screenplay led to a merely "watchable" film.

Marquis de Sade bibliography

Donatien Alphonse François de Sade, best known as the Marquis de Sade, was a French aristocrat, revolutionary and author of philosophical and sadomasochistic novels exploring such controversial subjects as rape, bestiality and necrophilia. He was a philosopher of extreme freedom, unrestrained by morality, religion or law, with the pursuit of personal pleasure as its foremost principle. de Sade was incarcerated in various prisons and in an insane asylum for about 32 years of his life, during which much of his writing was done. The term "sadism" is derived from his name.

Jean-Jacques Keller

Jean-Jacques Keller (1635–1700) and his brother Jean-Balthazar Keller (1638–1702) were Swiss gunfounders from Zürich, in the service of France. 
Jean-Jacques was considered as one of the most skillful founders of France. In 1669, he became "Master of the foundries" ("Commissaire des Fontes") at Douai. He also established other foundries in Besançon, Breisach and Pinerolo. His work was integral part of the plan established by Louvois in 1666 to have the army and artillery reorganized.
His brother Jean-Balthasar was rather involved with the founding of statues. He famously founded the statue of Louis XIV then located in the Place Vendôme, in December 1692, in a single piece, something never achieved before. The statue was destroyed during the French Revolution on the 10th of August, 1792. 
Jean-Jacques met with trouble when some of his guns burst in 1694. He was then replaced by his brother Jean-Balthasar as "Commissaire des Fontes" at Douai.
The two brothers had a great influence on cannon founding techniques in France, and made thousands of artillery pieces.
The technology they employed, involving the founding of cannons around a plaster core, was superseded by the De Vallière system in 1732.

Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees Ltd

Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees Ltd [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1977/5.html EWCA Civ 5 is an English contract law case, concerning unilateral contracts, and when embarking on the performance of an act for which an offer is open, at what point the offer may be withdrawn. In particular, Goff LJ observed that there would be a duty to not prevent full performance of terms in a unilateral offer, once performance had begun.
Facts.
Daulia Ltd wanted to buy the premises on Millbank, London from Four Millbank Nominees Ltd, who were mortgagees in possession. Formal contracts were never exchanged, but Daulia argued they did obtain a unilateral contract by the first defendants that they would enter into a written contract of sale, if they attended Four Millbank's offices with a draft contract on terms already negotiated and a deposit. But when Daulia Ltd's representatives attended, Four Millbank refused to exchange. Daulia Ltd claimed breach of the oral agreement.
At first instance, Brightman J struck out Daulia Ltd's statement of claim for failing to comply with s.40(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (now, the requirement of form for contracts for interests in land under s.2, Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989). Daulia Ltd appealed.
Judgment.
The Court of Appeal dismissed Daulia Ltd's appeal. They held there was a unilateral contract for disposition of land, and therefore it could not be effective because it did not comply with s.40(1). Furthermore there was no act of part performance, which could lead to a binding contract. In the course of his decision Goff LJ said that had there been part performance, it would be a duty of the offeror to not prevent full performance (see also, "Errington v. Errington"). Goff LJ's judgment went as follows.

Kiviter process

The Kiviter process is an above ground retorting technology for shale oil extraction. 
History.
The Kiviter process is based on the earlier vertical retort technology (Pintsch's generator). This technology underwent a long process of development. The early concept of central inlet of the heat carrier was later replaced by a concept of heat carrier gas cross flow in the retort. 
The Kiviter technology has been used in Estonia since 1921, when first experimental Kiviter retorts were built. The first commercial scale oil plant based on the Kiviter technology was built in 1924.
From 1955 to 2003, Kiviter technology was used for oil shale processing also in Slantsy, Russia.
Technology.
The Kiviter process is classified as an internal combustion technology. The Kiviter retort is a vertical cylindrical vessel that heats coarse oil shale with recycled gases, steam, and air. To supply heat, gases (including produced oil shale gas) and carbonaceous spent residue (char) are burnt within the retort. Raw oil shale is fed into the top of the retort, and is heated by the rising gases, which pass laterally through the descending oil shale causing decomposition of the rock. Pyrolysis is completed in the lower section of the retort, where the spent shale contacted with more hot gas, steam and air is heated to about to gasify and burn the residual carbon (char). Shale oil vapors and evolving gases are delivered to a condensing system, where condensed shale oil is collected, while non-condensable gases are fed back to the retort. Recycled gas enters the bottom of the retort and cools the spent shale, which then leaves the retort through a water-sealed discharge system.
The Kiviter process uses large amounts of water, which is polluted during processing, and the solid waste residue contains water-soluble toxic substances that leach into the surrounding area.
Commercial use.
The Kiviter process is used by the Estonian Viru Keemia Grupp's subsidiary VKG Oil. The company operates several Kiviter retorts, the largest of them having a processing capacity of 40 tonnes per hour of oil shale feedstock.

The is a Japanese annotation of the "Avatamsaka Sūtra". Dated to 794, it is the oldest Japanese "ongi", or collection of difficult to interpret words showing their pronunciation and meaning, and is a National Treasure of Japan.
Background.
The text is two fascicles in length. The compiler is unknown but is presumed to have related to Tōdai-ji. It is an annotation of the 80-volume "Avatamsaka Sūtra". As the original was written in Chinese, the annotation contains a list of words and expressions from the original and glosses them with Japanese readings and meanings. The orthography of the Japanese suggests that it is a late Nara period text. However, the manuscript contains a number of errors and is judged to be a copy of an earlier original. There is only one known existing manuscript.
Linguistics.
The text is viewed as a valuable reference for Old Japanese linguistics. The Japanese annotations are written in Man'yōgana and, with the exception of /to1, to2/, distinguishes between Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai. It contains a total of 162 Japanese words, many of which are the oldest extant citations. In addition, it also contains the oldest example of a long vowel as well as a number of Japanese-specific "Kan'yō-on" readings of kanji.

War in Ingushetia

The War in Ingushetia began in 2007 as an escalation of an insurgency in Ingushetia connected to the separatist conflict in Chechnya. The conflict has been described as a civil war by local human rights activists and opposition politicians; others have referred to it as an uprising. By mid-2009 Ingushetia had surpassed Chechnya as the most violent of the North Caucasus republics.
History.
In 2008 Magomed Yevloyev, owner of the highly critical opposition website Ingushetia.ru, was killed while in police custody. The aftermath of the killing was marked by an upsurge in separatist activity and animosity towards Russia and Russians among the Ingush population. At the center of this controversy was the deeply unpopular President Murat Zyazikov, a former KGB general who was criticized both by human rights groups and by some in the Russian government. The Ingush Interior Minister Musa Medov was targeted by a suicide bomber in October 2008. Eventually, Zyazikov was asked to resign. On 30 October 2008 Russian president Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree to remove Zyazikov from office and replace him with Lieutenant Colonel Yunus-bek Yevkurov. This was hailed by the Ingush opposition as a victory.
However, the violence did not end. According to police sources, nearly 50 people (including 27 rebels, 18 policemen and two civilians) died in the almost daily clashes in this small republic (less than 500,000 inhabitants) in the first three months of 2009. Assassinations and attempted assassinations of high-profile figures continued. On 10 June 2009 Aza Gazgireeva, the Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ingushetia, was gunned down, and on 13 June former Deputy Prime Minister Bashir Aushev was shot dead outside his home. Ingush President Yevkurov was seriously wounded in a suicide bomb attack on 22 June, and Construction Minister Ruslan Amerkhanov was shot dead in his office in August. In October 2010, the Islamist group Ingush Jamaat announced a moratorium on killing police officers; according to President Yevkurov, 400 police officers had been killed in Ingushetia in the five years to 2 October 2010.

Vincent Black Prince

The Vincent Black Prince was a British motorcycle made between 1954 and 1955 by Vincent Motorcycles. A year before the factory closed in 1955, Vincent produced the enclosed range of Vincent Black Knight and Black Prince. Phil Vincent described it as a "two-wheeled Bentley", and the enclosed Vincents attracted a lot of attention at the 1955 Earls Court show. Problems with production of the glass-fibre mouldings eventually led to financial difficulties; the last Black Prince left the Vincent production line on Friday, 16 December 1955.
Development.
Falling sales of the Series C Vincent motorcycles during 1952 and 1953 was partly attributed to dated styling, so Phil Vincent sought to update the range and development began what were to become the Series D machines. The main change was innovative full enclosure and weather protection, with glass fibre panels that included leg shields and a handlebar fairing. This was not about streamlining for speed, as the Vincent was already powerful enough for riders of the day - it was instead about the idea that the rider could travel to work in a suit rather than full motorcycle kit. Care was taken to ensure that the engine was still easily accessible for general maintenance, and the rear enclosure was hinged to provide access to the rear wheel and drive chain.
Vincent also tried to make it easier for the rider to get the motorcycle on to its stand by adding a huge lever on the left of the machine that could be operated from the saddle. The frame was also modified with a single tubular strut bolted to the steering head and a single damper replaced the twin rear shocks.
Launch.
The Black Prince was launched at the 1954 Earls Court motorcycle show, together with the 998 cc Vincent Black Knight and the 500 cc Vincent Victor (which never went into production as only the prototype was ever built). There was a lot of interest but much of it was critical, and the Black Prince was termed the motorcycle you either love or hate. "The Motor Cycle" road tested a Black Prince and concluded that it handled as well as the Vincent Black Shadow with improved fuel consumption.
Production.
Production of the Black Prince began in early 1955. Lucas components replaced the less reliable Miller electrical system and ignition was upgraded to coil and distributor. The rear enclosure, which incorporated the oil tank, was hinged to allow access to the rear wheel and final drive chain.Amal Monobloc carburettors improved starting. The centre stand was operated by a lever accessible from the saddle and the lower front mudguard stay served as an emergency front stand to facilitate the removal of the front wheel. Delay in delivery of the fibre-glass components from subcontractors delayed the availability of the first production bikes until early 1955. Approximately 200 of the enclosed models were built.
Financial collapse.
Increasingly affluent customers may have encouraged Vincent to go for a high-end luxury touring model, but at the same time high volume and very affordable small cars were flooding the market. Vincent's accountants came to the conclusion that the company was losing money on every Black Prince sold, so the last example of both the model and the marque left the production line on Friday, 16 December 1955.

Stan McEwan

Stanley "Stan" McEwan (born 8 June 1957) is a Scottish former professional footballer. He spent eight years at Blackpool in the 1970s and 1980s, making over 200 Football League appearances for the club. He also played for four other professional clubs in his career. His position was as a defender.
Blackpool.
Wishaw-born McEwan made his debut for Harry Potts' Blackpool midway through the 1975–76 season, in a single-goal victory over Leyton Orient at Bloomfield Road on 12 December 1975. He went on to make sixteen further appearances in the league that season, as well as two in the FA Cup.
In 1976–77, under new manager, compatriot Allan Brown, McEwan made eleven league appearances; however, the following season, 1977–78, he was given an extended run in the team, making 39 league appearances. He also scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–2 draw at Crystal Palace on 25 April.
McEwan was ever-present in Blackpool's 53 league and cup games in 1978–79, under Bob Stokoe, his third manager in his time at the club. He scored five league goals (four from the penalty spot), including two in a 5–0 home victory over Shrewsbury Town on 20 March. He also scored one penalty in the FA Cup and two goals (one a penalty) in the League Cup.
Stan Ternent replaced Stokoe for the start of the 1979–80 campaign. He made 25 league appearances before Ternent was sacked. Former 'Pool player Alan Ball was installed as Ternent's successor, and McEwan went on to make a further fourteen appearances during the remainder of the league calendar. He scored twelve goals, including five penalties. His two goals gave Blackpool victory in a Lancashire derby with Blackburn Rovers at Bloomfield Road on 22 September, and his penalty at Reading on 26 April was the only goal of the game. In addition, he scored two cup goals, one in each competition, which put him at the top of the club's overall goalscoring chart for the season.
McEwan made 24 league appearances under Ball during 1980–81. Ball was fired in the New Year, and was replaced by Allan Brown for his second stint in charge during McEwan's Blackpool career. Ball had omitted McEwan from the team for his final eight games in charge, but Brown reinstated him to the line-up for his first game back in the hot seat and the subsequent eleven games leading up to Blackpool's relegation to Division Four.
In McEwan's final season at the seaside, 1981–82, saw him make 25 league appearances. His final appearance for the club occurred on 27 March, in a 2–2 draw with Peterborough United at Bloomfield Road.
After Blackpool.
McEwan left Blackpool in March 1982 to join Exeter City. He made 65 league appearances in two years for "the Grecians", scoring fifteen goals. In 1984 he joined Hull City, and went on to make 113 league appearances for the club, scoring 25 goals. Four years later, he signed for Wigan Athletic. He made 29 league appearances for "the Latics" and scored four goals. He rounded off his professional career with an equally-brief spell with Hartlepool United in 1989, making fourteen league appearances and finding the net on two occasions.
McEwan moved into non-League football with Boston United in 1990.

Cuéllar Castle or The Castle of the Dukes of Alburquerque is the most emblematic monument in the town of Cuéllar, located in the province of Segovia, autonomous community of Castile and León, in Spain. It was declared "Bien de Interés Cultural" (Property of Cultural Interest) on 3 June 1931. Can be looked up online on the data base of protected buildings of the Ministry of Culture by writing in the field "Bien" the name of this monument.</ref>
The castle is conserved in good condition, and it has been built in different architectural styles between the 13th and 18th century. Much of the castle in the Gothic and Renaissance styles. The military building was extended and transformed in the 16th century, turning it into the palace of the Duke of Alburquerque. During its different building stages, masters such as Juan Guas, Hanequin of Brussels and her son Hanequin de Cuéllar, Juan, Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón, and Juan Gil de Hontañón "el mozo" or Juan de Álava have worked on the castle.
Among its historical owners, stands out Álvaro de Luna and Beltrán de la Cueva, as well as the successive Dukes of Alburquerque. Distinguished guests on it were some Castilian monarchs, as Juan I and his wife the Queen Leonor de Aragón y de Sicilia, that died on it, or María de Molina, that took refuge on this castle when her Kingdom was rejecting her. Also stands out figures as the painter Francisco Javier Parcerisa, or the writer José de Espronceda, the generals Joseph Léopold Sigisbert Hugo and Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, who set his garrison barracks in this castle during the Spanish War of Independence.
The Dukes of Alburquerque lived in this castle for centuries until they moved to Madrid to be close to the court. Thereafter their use of the castle was as leisure and holidays palace, abandoning the building slowly. At the late 19th century the castle was almost completely abandoned, and was victim of robberies. In 1938 was a political prison was settled within the castle, and after was established also a sanatorium for prisoners affected by tuberculosis. It was used as prison till 1966.
In 1972, the Department of Fine Arts carried out an intensive restoration, and made it the home of a Vocational Education school, which continues to this day.

Félix Doubront

Félix Antonio Doubront ["doo-Bront"] (born October 23, 1987) is a Venezuelan professional baseball pitcher with the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball. Listed at 6'2", 200 lb., Doubront bats and throws left-handed.
Early career.
Doubront was 17 years old when he entered the minors in 2005 with the VSL Red Sox (rookie), playing for them one year before joining the GCL Red Sox (rookie, 2006), Lowell Spinners (A–, 2006–2007), Greenville Drive (A, 2007–2008) and Lancaster JetHawks (A+, 2008). His most productive season came in 2008, when he posted a combined 13–9 record with a 3.76 ERA in 119 ⅓ innings of work.
Major League Career.
Boston Red Sox.
He made his Major League debut on Friday, June 18, 2010 versus the Los Angeles Dodgers. Doubront pitched five innings, gave up three earned runs, walked two, and struck out two for the win. It was a spot start and Doubront was optioned back to Pawtucket after the game. He was later recalled on July 5 after Clay Buchholz joined a long list of banged-up Red Sox players to go on the disabled list. Doubront made two more starts and lost both of them before being optioned on July 17. He was recalled August 6, and returned to the Red Sox roster as a reliever.
Doubront entered the 2012 season as one of the Red Sox starters, beating out Aaron Cook and Alfredo Aceves in spring training. Despite slow starts for Josh Beckett, Clay Buchholz and Jon Lester, and Daniel Bard's demotion to the minors, Doubront got off to a good start, earning 5 wins and 2 losses in his first ten starts. In June, Doubront took a no hitter into the sixth inning against the Miami Marlins. He finished the game giving up two runs on three hits and earned a win. He ended the season with a positive first year having a full-time starting job, with a record of 11-10.
Doubront turned in another effective season in 2013, posting an 11-6 record over 27 starts for a Red Sox team that would win 97 games and a World Championship. Doubront pitched out of the bullpen in the postseason, earning his first career postseason victory in Game 4 of the 2013 World Series.
Scouting report.
Doubront's main pitches are a four-seam and two-seam fastball that range between 90–95 mph. He also throws a cut fastball (87–89), a big curveball (76–80), and a changeup (85–88) that is used mostly against right-handed hitters. His deceptive delivery results in hitters not being able to pick up the ball until late. The late pick-up also makes his fastball look faster to opposing hitters.

Prussian S 4

The Prussian S 4's were German superheated express steam locomotives with the Prussian state railways, later grouped as DRG Class 13.5 in the Deutsche Reichsbahn. They were an evolutionary development of the Prussian S 3. The first locomotive was built in 1898 by Vulcan, Stettin as a modified S 3. She was the first superheated locomotive in the world. She was initially designated as "Hannover 74" and towards the end as the S 4 "Cassel 401". Two further trials locomotives appeared in 1899 and 1900 as "Hannover 86" and "Berlin 74" also classed as S 3's. They were later reclassified as S 4's "Hannover 401" and "Posen 401".
Not until the teething troubles had been resolved was the S 4 put into series production in 1902 in Borsig, from 1906 also in Henschel and Humboldt. Unlike the prototypes the production engines were developed independently of the S 3, and 104 examples were built in the years to 1909 when procurement was halted in favour of the Prussian S 6. Up to 1906 a smokebox superheater was installed; afterwards smoke tube superheaters were used.
The S 4's star waned even before the First World War, so that within a few years most of the engines had disappeared from the tracks. The remainder were employed on passenger train or even goods train duties.
In 1923 the Deutsche Reichsbahn recorded 44 S 4's in its provisional renumbering plan as 13 501-544. But by 1925 only four of them were left. These were given running numbers 13 501–504 in 1925 and were retired by 1927.
After the First World War, six locomotives were given to the Polish State Railways (PKP), where they were classified as Pd2 class, numbers 1 to 6. During the Second World War five S 4s came into the Reichsbahn holdings from Poland as 13 401–405. Two of them were eventually given back to Poland in 1955 by the DR.
The locomotives were equipped with tenders of Prussian classes pr 2’2’ T 16, pr 3 T 13 and pr 3 T 15.

Previously he was elected a councilman of the Lviv Oblast Council for several convocations. His political party has been criticized for its anti-Semitic and anti-Polish demonstrations.
Biography.
Tyahnybok was born in the city of Lviv to a family of doctors, he is also a former doctor himself. His father, Yaroslav Tyahnybok, a Merited Doctor of Ukraine, was a distinguished sports doctor, chief physician of the Soviet national boxing team, and a former boxer himself who achieved the title of the Master of Sports of the USSR. Oleh's great-grandfather was a brother of Lonhyn Tsehelsky, a politician in the West Ukrainian People's Republic. Tyahnybok claims he remembers from when he was younger the searches that were conducted by the agents of the KGB in the apartment of his family.
After school Tyahnybok enrolled into the Lviv Medical Institute and received part-time medical jobs as a corpsman and nurse, but after the second year was drafted to the army. After the return to the Institute he initiated the creation of the Med Institute Student Brotherhood - the first step in his life of a civil activist. Tyahnybok graduated from the institute in 1993 as a qualified surgeon (as he sometimes mentions, majoring in urology). In 1994 25-year-old Tyahnybok was elected to the Lviv Oblast Council and in 1998 he was elected to the Verkhovna Rada.
Political career.
In October 1991 Tyahnybok became a member of the Social-National Party of Ukraine. He is characterised as representative of Ukraine's far right. From 1994 till 1998, Tyahnybok served as a member of the Lviv Regional Council. In 1998, Tyahnybok was first elected to the Ukrainian Parliament as a member of Social-National Party of Ukraine, in the parliament he became a member of the People's Movement of Ukraine fraction. In 2002, Tyahnybok was reelected to the Ukrainian parliament as a member of Victor Yushchenko’s Our Ukraine bloc. In parliament he submitted 36 motions for debate, but the parliament adopted only four of them. In the majority of his motions he opposed the introduction of the Russian language as the second official state language, proposed recognition of the fighting role of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and Ukrainian Insurgent Army during World War II, called for the lustration of former communist officials, security service officers and undercover agents, and demanded the prohibition of communist ideology. None of these motions where adopted.
On July 20, 2004, Tyahnybok was expelled from the Our Ukraine parliamentary faction after he made a speech in the Carpathian Mountains at the gravesite of a commander of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. In the speech, which was aired on television in the summer of 2004, he made comments like: 
"are the ones "that the Moscow-Jewish mafia ruling Ukraine fears most""
and
""They were not afraid and we should not be afraid. They took their automatic guns on their necks and went into the woods, and fought against the Moskali, Germans, Kikes and other scum who wanted to take away our Ukrainian state.""
In his defence Tyahnybok said he had not offended Russians by calling them an occupying force as this was based on historical fact. He also denied that he was anti-Semitic, saying he was rather pro-Ukrainian. The head of the State Committee of National Migration (Derzhkomnatsmihratsia) Hennadiy Moskal published an open letter with insulting content towards the head of the AU Freedom. The Prosecutor's office filed criminal charges of inciting ethnic hatred, but later closed the case for lack of offense. Since that time Mr. Tyahnybok has won nine court cases in that regard. By the decisions of courts it was recognized that the criminal case was raised unlawfully, and the actions of TV-channel "Inter" that showed the footage of the Tyanybok's speech as well as the Head of the Derzhkomnatsmihratsia H. Moskal were recognized as ones that insult the honor and dignity Oleh Tyahnybok and caused him a moral damage. The actions around that issue led to creation of the ""Program in defense of Ukrainians"". Tyahnybok stated in 2012 "this speech is relevant even today" and "All I said then, I can also repeat now".
Since February 2004 Tyahnybok has headed the All-Ukrainian Union "Freedom".
In April 2005, Tyahnybok co-signed an open letter to President Yushchenko calling for a parliamentary investigation into the "criminal activities of organized Jewry in Ukraine."
Tyahnybok stood as a candidate for the post of Mayor of Kiev during the Kiev local election in 2008. In the elections Leonid Chernovetskyi was reelected with 37.7% of the vote, while Tyahnybok received 1.37% of the vote.
Tyahnybok was a candidate for President of Ukraine in the 2010 presidential election for the All-Ukrainian Union "Freedom". He received 352,282 votes, or 1.43% of the total. Most of his votes he received in the historic Halychyna oblasts - Lviv oblast, Ternopil oblast and Ivano-Frankivsk oblast accounted to 5% of the vote. In the second round, Tyahnybok did not endorse a candidate. He did presente a list of some 20 demands second round candidate Yulia Tymoshenko had to fulfil first before gaining his endorsement - which included publicizing alleged secret deals Tymoshenko had with Vladimir Putin and ridding herself of what he called Ukraine-haters in her close circles.
During the 2010 Ukrainian local elections his party won between twenty and thirty percent of the votes in Eastern Galicia where it became one of the main forces in local government.
During the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election Tyahnybok was (re-)elected (he was top candidate on his party list) into the Ukrainian parliament; when his party won 38 seats. Tyahnybok was elected leader of the party's parliamentary faction.
In December 2012 Tyahnybok was voted Person of the Year by readers of Ukraine's leading news magazine, Korrespondent.
Political positions.
Tyahnybok regards Russia as Ukraine's biggest threat. He has accused the Medvedev presidency of "waging virtual war on Ukraine along many fronts – in the information sphere and the diplomatic sector, within the energy trade and throughout the world of international PR spin.". He is pro-NATO and critical of the European Union, but supports a Europe of free nations. According to polls both stances put him at odds with the majority of Ukrainians. Tyahnybok also wants to deprive Crimea of its autonomous status and Sevastopol of its special status.
Tyahnybok wants to introduce a “nationality” section into Ukrainian passport, a visa regime with Russia, and for Ukrainians to pass a Ukrainian language test to work in the civil service.
Tyahnybok wants to re-establish Ukraine as a nuclear power. He believes this would stop the "Russian virtual war on Ukraine" (mentioned above).
Cultural and political image.
During a visit of Tyahnybok to Sevastopol on January 6, 2010 some 1,500 activists of parties and public movements picketed the Business and Culture Center where Tyahnybok had a meeting with voters.
Tyahnybok was voted Person of the Year for 2012 by readers of the country's leading news magazine, Korrespondent. Tyahnybok was ranked #43 in the 2012 list of "Top 100 Most influential Ukrainians" by Korrespondent.
In an opinion poll conducted on December 7–17, 2013, respondents showed that in a hypothetical presidential election between Viktor Yanukovych and Tyahnybok, results found that Tyahnybok would win with 28.8% of the popular vote, versus Yanukovych's 27.1%. Another poll taken on January 42–February 2, 2014 across all regions of Ukraine showed that in a presidential race between Tyahnybok and incumbent Yanukovych, 54.% of the population would vote for Tyahnybok.

Joe Hill Louis

Joe Hill Louis (September 23, 1921 – August 5, 1957), born Lester Hill, was an American singer, guitarist, harmonica player and one-man band. He is significant, along with fellow Memphis bluesman Doctor Ross, as one of only a small number of one-man blues bands to have recorded commercially in the 1950s, and as a session musician for Sun Records. 
Early life.
Louis was born Lester (or possibly Leslie) Hill on September 23, 1921 in Raines, Tennessee. His nickname “Joe Louis” arose as a result of a childhood fight with another youth. At the age of 14 he left home to work as a servant for a wealthy Memphis family, and also worked in the Peabody Hotel, Memphis, in the late 1930s. From the early 1940s onwards he worked as a musician and one-man band.
Recording and radio career.
Louis’ recording debut was made for Columbia in 1949, and his music was released on a variety of independent labels through the 1950s, most notably recording for Sam Phillips’ Sun Records, for whom he recorded extensively as a backing musician for a wide variety of other singers as well as under his own name. 
His most notable electric blues single "Boogie in the Park" (recorded July 1950 and released August 1950) featured Louis performing "one of the loudest, most overdriven, and distorted guitar stomps ever recorded" while playing on a rudimentary drum kit at the same time. It was the only record ever released on Sam Phillips' early Phillips label before founding Sun Records. Louis' electric guitar work is also considered a distant ancestor of heavy metal music.
His most notable recording at Sun Records was probably as guitarist on Rufus Thomas’s “Bear Cat”, recorded as an answer record to Big Mama Thornton’s “Hound Dog”, which reached No. 3 on the R&B chart and resulted in legal action for copyright infringement. He also shared writing credit for the song “Tiger Man”, which has been recorded by Elvis Presley, among others.
Around 1950 he took over the "Pepticon Boy" radio program on WDIA from B. B. King.
He was also known as “The Pepticon Boy” and “The Be-Bop Boy”.
Death.
Louis died on August 5, 1957 in John Gaston Hospital, Memphis, at the age of 35, from tetanus contracted as a result of an infected cut to his thumb, sustained while working as an odd job man.

Turnin Me On

"Turnin Me On" is a song by American singer-songwriter Keri Hilson, taken from her debut album, "In a Perfect World...". The song features American rapper Lil Wayne who co-wrote the song alongside Hilson and Zachary Anson Wallace. Production credits are shared between Danja and Polow da Don, who also co-wrote the song. Following the minimal chart success of Hilson's worldwide lead single "Energy" in the United States, international markets received "Return the Favor", while "Turnin Me On" was released as the third single in the US.
After experimenting with more pop-oriented music in her previous mentioned songs, Hilson opted for a more urban, hip-hop flavored sound for the song, due her to wanting to keep to her roots. While noting her less than stellar vocals on the track, critics praised Hilson's sassiness and attitude on the track and complimented Lil Wayne's verse, which has been called the best surprise rap since Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes on TLC's "Waterfalls." The song's accompanying music video features intricate Aaliyah and "Soldier"-esque choreography, dance scenes such as the Bird Walk, and Hilson being flaunted by men. The scenes are intercut with mirror scenes with younger kids.
The song was a commercial success in the United States, reaching number fifteen on the "Billboard" Hot 100, whilst reaching two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. "Turnin Me On" received two nominations at the 2009 BET Awards, and a "Song of the Year" nomination at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards. A leaked remix of the song caused controversy, with rumors that Hilson was taking shots at fellow female R&B singers Beyoncé Knowles and Ciara, however Hilson has fervently denied the rumors that it was a diss. Hilson performed the song as a part of a medley at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards and BET Awards.
Background.
In June 2008, Rap-Up originally reported the song as "Turn Off", while Hilson was playing it at Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records' second annual "Creme of the Crop" post-BET Awards dinner on June 25, 2008. Then an unmastered version of "Turn Off" was leaked online in September 2008. After selecting the predominately pop-sounding "Energy" and "Return the Favor", Hilson selected "Turnin Me On" as "In a Perfect World..."'s third single. When asked in an interview with "That Grape Juice" if choosing the song was a conscious effort, since the song had a different sound than the previous singles, Hilson responded, "Absolutely! I mean, there’s another side of me. I’m from Decatur, Georgia and that is a predominantly black neighbourhood with a lot of lower-class and some middle-class neighbourhoods. I guess that is the song that probably properly describes the type of girl I am, in relation to where I’m from. So yeah, it was definitely a conscious effort to make sure that I stay close to home on some records."
Composition and critical reception.
The song is a futuristic-esque R&B, synth-driven, bass-heavy urban song, featuring "bouncy" horn samples. Written in the key of C minor the song is in a "moderate R&B groove". It is set in common time and Hilson's vocals span from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5 " "Turnin Me On" is lyrically about physical attraction and composed in a hard-edged tone." "MTV Buzzworthy" described the song "as one-part Rihanna 'Umbrella' and two parts Beyoncé 'Ring the Alarm'"
Naming it a standout track from "In a Perfect World..." Andy Kellman of Allmusic called the song a "coquettish trunk rattler." Barry Walters of "Spin" complimented Hilson's "sassiness" on the song which she "wore well." "MTV Buzzworthy" called the Wayne's verse "the best surprise rap since Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes' verse in TLC's 'Waterfalls.'" J.K. Glei of "Cincinnati Metromix" called the track "playful" and said the track was easily the album's standout, commenting that Lil Wayne's cameo "steals the show." Sal Cinquemani of "Slant Magazine" commended the song, calling it "tight." Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" said called the song "slinky" and said, "the busyness coheres, with Ms. Hilson neatly gliding among the song’s many layers. And she may need the crutch; she is a careful, slight singer." Mikael Wood of "The Los Angeles Times" called the song "impeccably arranged." After watching the video, a writer for BET Sound Off said after it seemed Hilson and her label were losing faith, that "out of nowhere, Keri got her ish together", and said, "I’m sure she’ll regain the steam she lost during her first two singles." "Rap-Up" called "Turnin Me On" a standout track from "In a Perfect World...". The song received several accolades, as it was nominated for "Viewers' Choice" and "Best Collaboration" at the 2009 BET Awards. Additionally it was nominated for "Song of the Year" at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards.
Chart performance.
On the issue date of January 3, 2010, "Turnin Me On" entered the "Billboard" Hot 100 at number ninety. In its sixth week on the chart, it reached number thirty-five, giving Hilson her second top forty hit at a solo or featured artist. It later reached number fifteen, where it spent two weeks, becoming Hilson's biggest hit until the top five hit, "Knock You Down." Overall, the song had a twenty-two week stint on the Hot 100. Additionally it charted at twenty-eight on the now defunct Pop 100, and twenty-five on the Pop Songs chart, reaching the peak after seven weeks. On the week of February 18, 2009 in its eighteenth week on the chart, it peaked at two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It debuted at number eighty in Canada, where it peaked, spending a total of four weeks on the Canadian Hot 100. The song peaked and debuted at twenty-nine on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It fell to thirty-three the following week, and falling off the next week, completing a two-week stint on the chart.
Music video.
The music video for the single was directed by Erik White and shot in Atlanta, Georgia. It premiered on November 19, 2008, two weeks before the single was released for airplay or download. It was featured on E! News on December 15, 2008. Rich Boy, Polow da Don, and Leah LaBelle make cameos in the clip. While it was reported that T.I. would appear in the video, a doppelgänger does instead. The video is set almost entirely behind white and black backdrops, besides one club scene. Hilsonperforms choreography such as the Bird Walk, which according to "MTV Buzzworthy" is Aaliyah-style choreography, while being flaunted by shirtless, muscular men and donning "on" and "off" finger rings. BET Sound Off noted that some of the choreography was similar to Destiny's Child's "Soldier." As Hilson continues to be flaunted and performs additional choreography, which includes crumping-like moves, the scenes are interspersed with younger kids re-enacting the same scenes. Hilson appears alongside a speaker and a group of men dancing before the video cuts to Wayne. In this scene the rapper delivers his verse alongside Hilson in front of a black backdrop and on a couch. Near the end the younger girls and boys are shown performing Hilson and her dancers' moves, as the latter also continue to be flaunted by men. The video ends with Hilson being turned off by men at a club, with women in the club wearing "off" earrings like on Hilson's fingers.
"MTV Buzzworthy" said, "give it up for her sleek biker chick-meets-Park-Slope wardrobe and feel free to ogle/drool over the parade of shirtless dudes who look like they jumped off the cover of Abs Weekly magazine." The review also complimented "rapper/pants-dropper extraodinaire Lil Wayne" who helped "push her chest-bumpin' vid into must-see territory." Although commenting it a "Soldier" knock-off, BET Sound Off blog said, "the visual is pretty entertaining." Tracey Ford of AOL Boombox said, "the diva makes it perfectly clear how easy it is to turn a woman on and off." The video ranked at number two on " Top 100 Videos of 2009" countdown.
Live performances.
In promoting her album, Hilson performed the song on February 2, 2009 on 106 & Park. Hilson performed the song on March 17, 2009 on "Dogg After Dark". Lil Wayne joined her to perform the song with "Energy" on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" "Turnin Me On" was performed by Hilson at BET's Spring Bling 2009, and at BET's Rip the Runway 2009. She performed the song as part of medleys at the 2009 BET Awards as well as the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards.
Remixes.
The official remix of the song features new verses from Hilson & Lil Wayne and an additional verse & intro by R&B singer T-Pain. It was leaked on March 3, 2009. The leaked version of the official remix also features background vocals by Polow da Don, which was removed on the final version. The final version of the remix can be found Atlanta DJ Greg Street's mixtape, "Sertified Worldwide".
Several remixes for the song were released. Busta Rhymes is featured on one remix, to which BET Sound Off preferred to the original version, commenting, "Not that I don’t appreciate Keri and Weezy’s version because it’s actually a snazzy lil ditty, but Busta’s ambiance over Polow’s sound scape gives me a different vibe, that 'stand on your desk and mean mug everyone in your office who tells you to turn down your music' vibe." In January 2010, a remix featuring T.I. was released. A MSTRKRFT remix of the original version was released on iTunes.
Diss controversy.
On March 3, 2009, a remix version of the song, entitled "Turnin' Me Off", featuring a new verses from Hilson, Lil Wayne, and an additional by T-Pain surfaced online. In the remix, Hilson takes jabs at two unnamed female entertainers. Referred to as "the remix heard round the industry", media rumored that Hilson was taking shots at Beyoncé Knowles and Ciara, in lines like "You can dance, she can sing but need to move it to the left..", possibly referencing Ciara's acclaimed dancing ability, and Beyoncé's hit "Irreplaceable." The lyrics also point at other possible shots taken toward the artists such as Hilson stating one needs to "go sit down and have babies" and points out several songs written for the other. A BET columnist wrote, "critics couldn't fathom the purpose or reasoning behind the malicious gesture", while a writer for BET Sound Off noted that if Hilson or her management intended to engage in this, that it would be "career suicide."
However in an interview with "Hardknocktv", Hilson denied the claims that the remix was directed at dissing Knowles or Ciara. According to Hilson, Polow da Don gave her the idea to do a "fiery" record. Although she said she was not retracting anything in the song, calling her response a "blanket statement" she said she was not going to feel some sort of way about how other people interpret, and that blatantly dissing anyone was not the energy behind the record. Hilson commented she wanted to address the haters, and all the media speculation about the remarks was something they did not intend to accomplish with the song. She also addressed that the release of the song was not an intentional leak, stating most remixes are meant to be done when a record is hot, and although admitting that while "Turnin Me On" was not "a number one record", the remix was done three months prior.
While calling into WVEE during their interview with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, "I just want to tell Ciara it’s not about you. People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and "watching her from ground zero." Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R&B artists are the same, pointing out that "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." She further clarified, commenting "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people."
Rumors circulated once again when Ciara released a viral video "Basic Instinct (U Got Me)" to kick off promotion for her album of the same name. Ciara addressed claims that remarks in the song were referring to Hilson in an interview with "Rap-Up", stating that the song was dedicated to her haters, gave her a chance to express herself, and was about trusting her first instinct on everything.

Criticisms of neoclassical economics

Neo-classical economics has come under critique on the basis of its core ideologies, assumptions, and other matters.
Normative bias.
Neoclassical economics is sometimes criticized for having a normative bias. In this view, it does not focus on explaining actual economies but instead on describing a "utopia" in which Pareto optimality applies. In the opinion of some developers of an alternative approach, the purpose of neoclassical economics is "to demonstrate the social optimality if the real world were to resemble the model", not "to explain the real world as observed empirically".
Assumptions of rationality.
The assumption that individuals act rationally may be viewed as ignoring important aspects of human behavior. Many see the "economic man" as being quite different from real people. Many economists, even contemporaries, have criticized this model of economic man. Thorstein Veblen put it most sardonically. Neoclassical economics assumes a person to be,
"a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains, who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift about the area, but leave him intact."
Large corporations might perhaps come closer to the neoclassical ideal of profit maximization, but this is not necessarily viewed as desirable if this comes at the expense of neglect of wider social issues. The response to this is that neoclassical economics is descriptive and not normative. It addresses such problems with concepts of private versus social utility.
Equilibrium theory.
Problems exist with making the neoclassical general equilibrium theory compatible with an economy that develops over time and includes capital goods. This was explored in a major debate in the 1960s—the "Cambridge capital controversy"—about the validity of neoclassical economics, with an emphasis on the economic growth, capital, aggregate theory, and the marginal productivity theory of distribution. There were also internal attempts by neoclassical economists to extend the Arrow-Debreu model to disequilibrium investigations of stability and uniqueness. However a result known as the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem suggests that the assumptions that must be made to ensure that the equilibrium is stable and unique are quite restrictive.
Neoclassical economics is also often seen as relying too heavily on complex mathematical models, such as those used in general equilibrium theory, without enough regard to whether these actually describe the real economy. Many see an attempt to model a system as complex as a modern economy by a mathematical model as unrealistic and doomed to failure. Famous answer to this criticism is Milton Friedman's claim that theories should be judged by their ability to predict events rather than by the realism of their assumptions. Mathematical models also include those in game theory, linear programming, and econometrics.
For a detailed critique of mathematical modeling, as used in the
academic and political practice of neoclassical economics, see
Pitfalls of Economic Models.
In the "Concluding Remarks" (p. 524) of his 2001 Nobel Prize lecture,
Joseph Stiglitz examined why the neoclassical paradigm—and models
based on it—persists, despite his publication,
over a decade earlier, of some of his seminal results showing that
Information Asymmetries invalidated
core Assumptions of that paradigm and its models:
In the aftermath of the 2007-2009 global economic meltdown,
the profession's attachment to unrealistic models is increasingly
being questioned and criticized. After a weeklong workshop,
one group of economists released a paper highly critical of
their own profession's unethical use of unrealistic models.
Their "Abstract" offers an indictment of fundamental practices:
The assumption of rational expectations which has been introduced in some more modern neoclassical models (sometimes also called new classical) can also be criticized on the grounds of realism.
In general, allegedly overly unrealistic assumptions are one of the most common criticisms towards neoclassical economics. It is fair to say that many (but not all) of these criticisms can only be directed towards a subset of the neoclassical models (for example, there are many neoclassical models where unregulated markets fail to achieve Pareto-optimality and there has recently been an increased interest in modeling non-rational decision making).
Economists tend to focus on markets or aggregate outcomes instead of observing individual behavior. Neoclassical economists have argued that evolutionary or ""market forces"" tend to select naturally the most "“fit“" actors. Hence, neoclassical economic theories are based on assumptions that (competitive) markets provide an environment that involves incentives for economic actors to learn optimal behavior, on average, in the long run. In this line markets are thought to "“heal“" the cognitive imperfections of actors through evolutionary forces, compelling most of them to behave ""as if"" they were rational. According to Joseph Stiglitz, “(Economics as taught) in America’s graduate schools ... bears testimony to a triumph of ideology over science.” Recently more and more critics have raised their voices against the way Economics is being taught. On the subject Mark Blaug says: "Economics has increasingly become an intellectual game played for its own sake and not for its practical consequences for understanding the economic world. Economists have converted the subject into a sort of social mathematics in which analytical rigour is everything and practical relevance is nothing.”
Incomplete.
James K. Galbraith on his article "A contribution on the state of economics in France and the world" asks himself: "Is there anything missing even from the hotly contested domains of modern mainstream economics?" On his opinion, three large areas have disappeared from the teaching of Economics, "at very considerable intellectual and social cost": the history of economics itself, the proper study of macroeconomic and monetary economics - which have been submerged by the neoclassical emphasis on market transactions between firms and households - and the lack of instruction in differing institutional contexts (political, national and international structures, policy histories).
Learning in Economics: Do Markets Heal?
However recent studies have shown that empirical evidence on this subject is mixed. There is plenty of empirical evidence that ""anomalous"" behavior can survive for a long time in real markets such as in market ""bubbles"" and market ""herding"" (see AVERY & ZEMSKY, 1998). Evidence from the laboratory shows that some anomalies are overcome by learning in real life market environments, while others are not: “The data suggest the market glass is both half-full of deviations and half-empty because some deviations were drained away by learning“ (CAMERER, 1995, 675).
Recently empirical evidence has indicated that markets produce the types of learning assumed in the traditional neoclassical Economics only under very limited ideal conditions - which are rarely met in real-life - namely perfect competition and free information (see SUNDER, 1995).
It may take an extended period of time for markets to eventually converge to an equilibrium, if at all. Even under ideal conditions especially if the economic actors' initial beliefs are not coordinated.

Walter Rudin House

The Walter Rudin House is a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Marshall Erdman prefab building located at 110 Marinette Trail, Madison, Wisconsin. Designed in 1957, it is the first of the only two examples of the second type (known as Prefab #2) of the Marshall Erdman Prefab Houses. This house and the James McBean Residence have the same floor plan and vary only in minor details such as paint color and siting. Construction was completed in June, 1959 and the house was sold to UW-Madison mathematicians Walter and Mary Ellen Rudin.
The house has a large, square 2-story living room which is lit by a wall of windows. Also on the first floor are the dining area, kitchen, entry hall, utility room, and the master bedroom. A large concrete block fireplace separates the kitchen and living room. A stairway leads to a balcony and three second-story bedrooms. Unusual for a Wright-designed house, it has a full basement.
The house is constructed from concrete block with horizontal board and batten siding. A row of windows just below the soffit make the chunky flat cantilevered roof appear to float above the house. A carport attached to one corner of the house completes the design.

Blackburn Meadows Power Station

Blackburn Meadows Power Station was a coal-fired power station situated on the River Don, between Sheffield and Rotherham in South Yorkshire, England. It was well known for its two cooling towers which were a landmark on the M1 motorway and came to be known as the Tinsley Towers. They were demolished on 24 August 2008, nearly thirty years after the station ceased generating electricity.
History.
The station was built in 1921 by the Sheffield Corporation, to support the steel industry in the Lower Don Valley. The station was expanded in the 1930s. Hyperboloid cooling towers 6 and 7 were constructed between 1937 and 1938, replacing earlier square cooling towers. They were designed by LG Mouchell and Partners. The station was nationalised after the Second World War and operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board. The station closed on 27 October 1980 with a generating capacity of 72 megawatts.
Most of the station was demolished following the closure, but two of the cooling towers were left standing until August 2008.
Part of the site is proposed to be used for a new biomass power station by the owners E.ON UK.
Tinsley cooling towers.
For safety reasons the Tinsley cooling towers could not easily be demolished, and were left standing unused for a further 27 years after the stations closure. Positioned directly alongside the major motorway bridge, Tinsley viaduct, the towers were an iconic landmark for the area, particularly due to their prominence when viewed from the M1 motorway. There was a campaign to save the towers, known locally as the salt and pepper pots, from demolition with proposals to turn them into a giant art installation.
The two towers were demolished at 03.00 a.m. on 24 August 2008. However a significant portion of the north tower remained standing for a short while, which had to be destroyed manually.

A bed base, sometimes called foundation, is the part of a bed that supports the mattress. The bed base is itself held in place and framed by the bedstead. In the United States, box spring bed bases are very common (to the point where 'bed base' and 'box spring' may be used synonymously). In Europe, sprung slats are much more common.

Agaricus pocillator

Agaricus pocillator, a woodland mushroom, is distributed through southeastern North America in ranges at least as far north as Illinois. It can be distinguished in the field by its dark center, its small, bulbous base, which stains yellow, and its relatively slight stature. It is very similar to "Agaricus placomyces", but is a slightly smaller mushroom with a scalier cap and a more northern range within the United States. Edibility is not certain for "Agaricus pocillator", but several other yellow-staining "Agaricus" species are poisonous. Hikers are often warned to avoid eating it when spotted.
Ecology.
They are saprobic, meaning that they survive by decomposing dead or decaying organic material. They often grow alone or gregariously under hardwoods and in mixed woods throughout the southeast of North America.
Description.
Their cap is 3–10 cm, convex to broadly convex or nearly flat in age, sometimes with an obscure, darker bump, and dry. The top is mainly whitish to dingy, developing vaguely concentric brownish to grayish scales towards the center. Their gills are free from the stem, close, and white, becoming pinkish, then brown.
The stem is 4–8 cm long, 0.5–1 cm thick, more or less equal, and contains a small bulbous base that bruises yellow. In addition, it has a ring that typically persists into maturity, and a partial veil when covering the gills not developing dark droplets.
The flesh is white throughout and staining bright yellow in the base.
The taste is not distinctive or somewhat unpleasant. In contrast, the odor is often unpleasant (phenolic), but sometimes not distinctive.
The spore print is brown.
Chemical reactions involve combining the cap and flesh yellow with potassium hydroxide (KOH).
The spores are 4.5-6 x 3-3.8 µm and elliptical.

Economy of Utah

Utah has a largely mixed economy covering industries like tourism, mining, agriculture, manufacturing, information technology, finance, and petroleum production. The majority of Utah's gross state product is produced along the Wasatch Front, containing the state capital Salt Lake City.
Economy.
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis the gross state product of Utah in 2010 was $114.5 billion, or almost 1% of the total United States GDP of $14.55 trillion for the same year. The per capita personal income was $36,457 in 2005. Major industries of Utah include: coal mining, cattle ranching, salt production, and government services. 
According to the 2007 State New Economy Index, Utah is ranked the top state in the nation for Economic Dynamism, determined by 
"The degree to which state economies are knowledge-based, globalized, entrepreneurial, information technology-driven and innovation-based."
In eastern Utah petroleum production is a major industry. Near Salt Lake City, petroleum refining is done by a number of oil companies. In central Utah, coal production accounts for much of the mining activity.
Utah collects personal income tax at a single rate of 5%, but provides tax credits to low and middle income taxpayers to provide a progressive tax system. The state sales tax has a base rate of 4.65 percent, with cities and counties levying additional local sales taxes that vary among the municipalities. Property taxes are assessed and collected locally. Utah does not charge intangible property taxes and does not impose an inheritance tax.
As of October 2012, Utah's unemployment rate sits at 5.2%, and as of September 2012, ranked 6th out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 8.0% of Utahns were considered unemployed in March 2011, compared to the 9.7% in March 2010.
Farming.
Farming plays an important role in rural Utah. Crops like hay, corn and barley can be produced despite the dry land. Cultivated land, including isolated farms in river valleys and considerable dry farming acreage, is limited to a small percentage of the state's total area. The bulk of income from agriculture comes from livestock and livestock products, including sheep, cattle, dairying, and an expanding poultry industry. Abundant sunshine provides some compensation for inadequate rainfall, and the climate is generally moderate, allowing for substantial fruit production.
Tourism.
Tourism is a major industry in Utah, and is well known for its year-round outdoor recreational activities.. With five national parks (Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion), Utah has the third most national parks of any state after Alaska and California. In addition, Utah features seven national monuments, two national recreation areas, six national forests, and numerous state parks and monuments.
Utah is well known for its winter activities and has seen an increase in tourism since the 2002 Winter Olympics. Park City is home to the United States Ski Team. Utah's ski resorts are primarily located in northern Utah near Salt Lake City, Park City, Ogden, and Provo. In 2008, for a second year in a row, Deer Valley, in Park City, was ranked the top ski resort in North America by more than 20,000 subscribers of Ski Magazine. In addition to having prime snow conditions and world-class amenities, Northern Utah's ski resorts are well liked among tourists for their convenience and proximity to a large city and International Airport, as well as the close proximity to other ski resorts, allowing skiers the ability to ski at multiple locations in one day. In Southern Utah, Brian Head Ski Resort is located in the mountains near Cedar City. 
The 2002 Winter Olympics were celebrated in Utah and offered a great boon to the economy of the state. Several facilities were built to accommodate the influx of tourism that accompanied and lingered after the Olympics. Former Olympic venues including Utah Olympic Park and Utah Olympic Oval are still in operation for training and competition and allows the public to participate in numerous activities including ski jumping, bobsleigh, and speed skating.
Utah features many cultural attractions such as Temple Square in Salt Lake, the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, and the Utah Shakespearean Festival in Cedar City. 
Other attractions include Monument Valley, the Great Salt Lake, the Bonneville Salt Flats, and Lake Powell.
Mining.
Beginning in the late 19th century with the state's mining boom (including the Bingham Canyon Mine, among the world's largest open pit mines), companies attracted large numbers of immigrants with job opportunities. Since the days of the Utah Territory mining has played a major role in Utah's economy. Historical mining towns include Mercur in Tooele County, Silver Reef in Washington County, Eureka in Juab County, Park City in Summit County and numerous coal mining camps throughout Carbon County such as Castle Gate, Spring Canyon, and Hiawatha. These settlements were characteristic of the boom and bust cycle that dominated mining towns of the American West. During the early part of the Cold War era, uranium was mined in eastern Utah. Today mining activity still plays a major role in the state's economy. Minerals mined in Utah include copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, zinc, lead, and beryllium. Fossil fuels including coal, petroleum, and natural gas continue to play a major role in Utah's economy, especially in the eastern part of the state in counties such as Carbon, Emery, Grand, and Uintah.

Christmas Under Fire

Christmas Under Fire is a 1941 British short documentary film directed by Harry Watt for the Crown Film Unit of the Ministry of Information. It was conceived as propaganda primarily for an American audience, to raise support for the Allied cause during the Second World War. Produced in the context of German bombings of British cities, it depicts the resilience of British civilians despite the hardships they suffered during Christmas 1940, by showing the continuation of Christmas traditions in the face of the disruptions caused by war. The film is a sequel to "London Can Take It", with the same narrator, Quentin Reynolds. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short, which was won by "Churchill's Island".
Synopsis.
The film shows Christmas 1940, in the middle of the Blitz. Christmas traditions are depicted in juxtaposition with a wartime backdrop: Christmas trees are dug up for air raid shelters; housewives buy food for the Christmas dinner; theatres stage pantomime productions; schoolchildren produce handmade Christmas cards. People are shown celebrating Christmas while sheltering in the London Underground, accompanied by a carol sung by the choir of King's College, Cambridge.
Production.
"Christmas Under Fire" was produced by the Crown Film Unit of the Ministry of Information, commissioned as a sequel to "London Can Take It". It was designed primarily for distribution in America and, in order to increase the film's appeal to an American audience, Quentin Reynolds from the magazine "Collier's Weekly" was chosen as the film's narrator; Reynolds had previously written and narrated two other British propaganda films, "London Can Take It" and "London's Reply to Germany's False Claims".
The film was produced in the context of The Blitz, the series of German bombing raids on British cities that began in September 1940. A central message of the film is that "life goes on", with Christmas traditions continuing despite disruption caused by bombing. In order to encourage the support of the American population, the film was designed to shake the complacency of neutral America, while depicting the resilience, determination and defiance of British civilians. One window cleaner, for example, is shown putting up a poster stating: "Business As Usual: if you've got no windows, we'll clean your chimneys".
Release and reception.
As well as being released in Britain, the film was distributed in America by Warner Brothers, whose income from distributing the film was donated to the Spitfire Fund, which was used to help RAF construction of Spitfire aircraft.
"Christmas Under Fire" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short, losing to the Stuart Legg film "Churchill's Island", another work about the wartime defence of Britain.
DVD release.
The film is included on volume 3 of the British Film Institute GPO Film Unit DVD collection, "If War Should Come".

Sadie Harris

Sadie Harris is a recurring fictional character from the American television medical drama "Grey's Anatomy", which airs on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes and portrayed by actress Melissa George. Introduced as a surgical intern who has an old companionship with the series' protagonist Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), she eventually forms a friendship with Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), and departs after it is revealed she cheated her way into the surgical program.
George was invited to meet with "Grey's Anatomy" executive producers after the show's casting agents saw her in the 2008 television drama, "In Treatment". The actress' original contract included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances in season five, with the possibility of becoming a series regular. She was originally planned to be a romantic foil for Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), but the role was retooled after the former departed in November 2008.
After speculation as to whether the character would become a series regular, it was confirmed that George's character would not be joining the series and would soon depart. George explained that it was her own decision to leave the show, in response to the assertions that her departure was done to "de-gay" "Grey's Anatomy". The character has received mixed feedback from critics, and has been characterized as "naughty", "mischievous", and "nutty".
Storylines.
Sadie Harris first appears in the season five episode "These Ties That Bind", in which it is made known that she was once a very close friend of Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). Harris and Meredith Grey had given each other nicknames during an extended vacation in Europe: "Die" and "Death", respectively. Meredith Grey's best friend is Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh); Yang becomes jealous of the friendship between Meredith Grey and Harris. Having joined Seattle Grace Hospital as a surgical intern, Harris begins a friendship with fellow intern Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith Grey's sister. The hospital's interns are frustrated with their lack of surgical opportunities, so Harris cuts her shoulder, and lets the interns stitch it back together. 
Harris later volunteers herself to have an appendectomy to help the interns learn that surgical procedure, on the condition that she gets a chance to perform one afterwards. The interns make a mistake in the surgery, and Harris is seriously endangered, but is rescued by the residents. The interns are put on probation and rebuked by Meredith Grey, although Harris tells Lexie Grey that she is not apologetic. Following the surgery fiasco, Harris approaches the hospital's chief of surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), and claims responsibility for the incident. He informs her that the reason she has not been fired is because of his personal friendship with her father. 
Later, she flirts with Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), although the relationship is never pursued. Harris continues to pursue a friendship with Lexie Grey, even going as far as to help her cover up Lexie Grey's blooming relationship with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). In "Before and After", during a competition among the interns set up by Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) notices Harris' lack of medical knowledge. Although he offers to tutor Harris, she declines and chooses not to tell Webber, which O'Malley does instead. When Harris comes out from a talk with Webber, she tells Meredith Grey that she has decided to quit, and that she did not qualify for the surgical program. When she tries to get Meredith Grey to go back to vacationing in Europe, Meredith Grey declines and Harris departs.
Development.
Casting and creation.
Melissa George received an invitation to meet the show's executive producers, Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers, from "Grey's Anatomy" casting agents after they saw her recurring guest performances in the television drama "In Treatment" (2008). George explained that after meeting with the producers, she was set to begin working.
George's initial contract included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances, with the possibility of becoming a series regular. However, according to George's representative, she did not intend to do more than eight episodes. Harris was first planned to have a romance with Torres, but Rhimes eventually changed that after George started filming. She was initially written as a lesbian, but was revised as bisexual.
In January 2009, George confirmed her departure from "Grey's Anatomy", and several reasons were cited for her leaving. George said she had decided to leave to pursue another project, and offered praise to the cast members. However, a representative of the show claimed the actress' departure was due to a mutual agreement between "Grey's Anatomy" and George, explaining that the character's storyline "came to a natural end", but that everyone was upset with her departure. Following Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith)'s departure, "E! Online" Kristin Dos Santos asserted that Smith's dismissal from the show, and the rewrite of Harris' storyline, was enforced by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), as part of an attempt to "de-gay" "Grey's Anatomy", but these claims were rebuked by Rhimes.
Characterization.
George's character has been described as "naughty" and "mischievous", as well as "nutty". She added that Harris' sexuality is not the main aspect of her personality. George called her character "broken", and opined that her outgoing personality is meant to cover up something else. George stated that the way she portrayed Harris was influenced by the outspokenness of Lisa Rowe, a sociopathic character from "Girl, Interrupted" (1999) played by Angelina Jolie.
Peter Nowalk, one of the show's writers, characterized Harris as "quite a flirty gal". Other "Grey's Anatomy" cast members have also commented on the character of Harris; Chandra Wilson stated that Harris is fast paced, whereas Leigh said that the character is there to "wreak havoc on Seattle Grace". "Entertainment Weekly" Michael Ausiello said that Harris is "an intern with an open mind towards sexuality".
Debbie Chang, writing for BuddyTV, and Jonathan Toomey of "The Huffington Post" also cast ideas about Harris' self-incision in the episode "In the Midnight Hour", wondering if she "has a death wish" and "what is wrong with her". Stacy McKee, a primary writer for the show, said Harris is Meredith Grey's "pre-Cristina Cristina" and that she shares "a history with Meredith that Cristina can't".
Reception.
Throughout her run on "Grey's Anatomy", the character received mixed feedback among critics. Jon Caramanica of the "Los Angeles Times" was critical of her character development, calling George "woefully misused". Writing for "The Age", Michael Idato opined that the storyline between Harris and Yang was "frosty", adding that the writing was in a "true soap fashion". 
Darren Devlyn of the "Herald Sun" wondered if the producers brought in George to "shake up the show", and found the character's bisexual storyline similar to Hahn's. Speaking of George's exit, Kris De Leon of BuddyTV noted that she departed on the "best of terms" in comparison with Isaiah Washington (Preston Burke), Smith, and Knight—former cast members who had "rocky" exits. 
Erin McWhirter of "The Daily Telegraph" called George's character "outrageous" in response to the appendectomy. Former "Star-Ledger" editor Alan Sepinwall was critical of the character, saying he rolled his eyes in regard to her letting the interns perform procedures on her, sarcastically writing: "Ooooh, she's damaged! And sexy! She takes off her top and then eagerly cuts herself for the other interns! That's hot!" "TV Guide" Erin Lulevitch referred to her as a "masochist" due to her self-incision.
Scott Ellis of "The Sydney Morning Herald" enjoyed the character, calling her "intriguing". "Entertainment Weekly" Jennifer Armstrong enjoyed Harris in "Sympathy for the Devil", finding it "sweet" when she took the blame for causing Sloan's penile fracture, to avoid Lexie Grey being embarrassed. Chang of BuddyTV claimed that Harris is "kind of a rebel", and the "Daily News" Lauren Johnston deemed her personality "brash".

2008 Speedway Premier League

The 2008 Premier League was the second division of motorcycle speedway racing in the United Kingdom and the 14th season since its creation in 1995. The league was governed by the Speedway Control Bureau (SCB), in conjunction with the British Speedway Promoters' Association (BSPA).
The League consisted of 16 teams for the 2008 season with the addition of the 2007 Conference League champions the Scunthorpe Scorpions. New rules introduced for 2008 include three points for an away win compared to two points in 2007, and the removal of bonus points, in which a team was awarded an additional point for an aggregate win over a home and away match against another team. The team finishing at the top of the league table at the end of the season after accumulating the most points were declared the Premier League champions. The four highest placed teams were entered into promotion play-offs, whereby the Premier League play-off winner faced the Elite League relegation play-off final losers over two legs. Teams finishing in fifth to twelfth at the time of the fixture cut-off date compete in the Young Shield.
The Edinburgh Monarchs were crowned the Premier League champions after ending the season as the highest placed team. The Somerset Rebels finished second, King's Lynn Stars third and the Rye House Rockets fourth. All four teams took part in the promotion play-off with Edinburgh and King's Lynn reaching the final. Edinburgh won 93–90 on aggregate and faced Elite League team Wolverhampton Wolves, but lost the two-legged promotion/relegation final 106–76.

Falie

The Falie is a ketch that traded for many years in Australian waters. Originally built in 1919 as the motor schooner collier Hollands Trouw, she was purchased by the Spencer's Gulf Transport Company, renamed, and used for coastal trading in South Australia. The vessel commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as HMAS "Falie" during World War II, serving first as an inspection vessel primarily patrolling the Port of Sydney, Australia, then as a stores ship.
Returned to her owners in 1946, "Falie" was used to transport explosives around Australia before resuming the South Australian coastal trade to Kangaroo Island and on occasion carrying bulk Gypsum from Stenhouse Bay from 1968. She was retired in 1982, then purchased by the South Australian government for preservation. Although initially used for day and overnight sails, by 2005 the ship had fallen into disrepair.
Design and construction.
She was built in Maassluis, Netherlands by W. Richter, as a gaff rigged motor schooner in 1919 and named "Hollands Trouw". At the time she was built as a speculation by the builder, in the hope of selling her to a prospective buyer. As a result, she sat idle after her launch in 1919 until purchased by Spencer's Gulf Transport Company in 1922.
Operational history.
She was bought by the Spencer's Gulf Transport Company Limited in 1922. In 1923, she sailed to South Australia where she was renamed as the "Falie" and participated in the extensive ketch trade to isolated towns along the coast of South Australia. Later she was converted from her original configuration to a ketch.
During World War II, the Royal Australian Navy requisitioned the "Falie", renaming her as HMAS "Falie". Initially she was used as an inspection vessel. On the night of 31 May, she was acting as a watchdog outside Sydney Harbour, when she struck a Japanese midget submarine trying to infiltrate the harbour. The "Falie" was converted in 1943 to a stores vessel, and was deployed to Papua New Guinea, where she saw action landing troops in enemy territory by night.
In 1946, she was paid off and returned to her owners. For the next 15 years, she carried explosives around the Australian coast. In 1968, she returned to South Australian waters where she continued to operate as a trading vessel until she retired in 1982, the last ketch to operate commercially in South Australian waters, and the last sail powered trading vessel in Australian waters.
Operating as an overnight charter vessel between 1986 and 2005, Falie supported fishing and diving tours around the South Australian coastline. Between 1990 and 2005, Falie was the primary vessel used for Rodney Fox Shark Expeditions. Here she featured in many international nature documentaries, filming and photographing great white sharks off South Australia's coast, and entertaining tourists from Australia and around the world on shark cage diving adventures.
Preservation.
The "Falie" was then purchased by the Government of South Australia for preservation as a community and educational resource. The ship was restored for the state's sesquicentenary celebrations in 1986, with re-masting, new sails, and the fitting of accommodation and a galley. With this arrangement, she could carry up to 70 passengers on day trips, or 20 passengers plus nine crew overnight. 
In 2005, a survey revealed that her hull plates had corroded to the point where she was unseaworthy. She was not returned to seaworthiness as no sponsor could be found to cover the cost of repairs, estimated to be more than a million dollars.
In 2007, it was proposed to move the "Falie" to the wharf at American River, Kangaroo Island as an interpretive maritime museum, but by 2009, this had not been acted on. It was suggested that the South Australian government was looking to divest itself of the "Falie", and that the estimated cost of repairs to the hull was in excess of $3 million.
"Failie" is currently owned by the SA Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (formerly DTEI).

Earthly Girls are Easy

"Earthy Girls are Easy" is the second episode in the 13th season of the Fox animated series "King of the Hill", and the 237th episode overall. It originally aired on October 5, 2008. Marissa Jaret Winokur and Mo Collins guest star. The episode's title references the 1988 comedy movie "Earth Girls Are Easy".
Plot.
Hank is horrified to discover Bobby and Joseph digging a hole in his prized lawn, but when the boys explain that they are planting trees for their Earth science class, he warms up to the idea and helps them. Later, Buck announces to the Strickland Propane employees that the Bystander is threatening to run an article exposing his having discarded old propane tanks in the river; when everyone realizes that this apparent disregard for the environment will ruin Strickland's reputation, Hank proposes that the company 'go green'. The next day finds the employees carpooling, recycling, and reducing electricity consumption, although Buck repeatedly demonstrates his plaintive disapproval over how inconvenient the changes are for him. Later, Hank discusses the matter in the alley with his friends, and Dale suggests that the company simply buy carbon offsets. Hank expresses his disgust at the idea of throwing money at one's own problem for someone else to fix, and instead points to Bobby and Joseph, who are still busy voluntarily planting trees, as an example of proper environmental action. When Hank arrives at work the next day, he is appalled to find that not only has Dale started his own carbon offset 'business' using Bobby and Joseph's tree planting, but that he has talked Buck, who now feels no further obligation to 'going green', into buying offsets as well, using some of his unused land as a place to plant the offset trees.
While Buck takes advantage of Strickland's new 'green' image to sweet-talk women, Dale rethinks his business plan and sends Bobby and Joseph around to sell the offsets, saying that he and Octavio will be in charge of the planting instead. However, he reasons that no one has any way of knowing how many 'carbons' each tree absorbs, and thus that continuing to plant trees isn't really necessary. Meanwhile, Buck encounters two attractive young musicians on their way to an environment benefit concert in another state and gets the idea to host his own concert, using the land where the offset planting is supposedly happening as the venue, to win favor with them, going so far as to promote the concert on Channel 84 and putting Hank in charge of organizing the event. When Hank goes to take a look at the site, though, he finds only a handful of neglected and dying saplings. He immediately tracks down Dale and forces him to confess to Buck that he has not actually been planting any trees. Panicked and outraged, Buck demands a backup plan, and Dale proposes to contact a rejected member of his gun club, pay him for the carbon offset rights for the many trees on his property, and simply have the concert there instead.
The day of the concert arrives, and throngs of jubilant environmentalists surround the stage. Buck gives a speech full of blatant lies about Strickland's role with the surrounding forests, and Hank, unable to keep silent over Buck and Dale's deception, tricks Buck into giving up the microphone and confesses to the assembled masses that the trees around them had been there all along and that Strickland Propane had done nothing. The crowd, however, misinterprets his confession as environmental actions, and Hank resignedly yields the stage to the opening act, leaving the audience to their blissful ignorance and allowing the concert to begin.

<doc id="20357983" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20357983" title="Copper toxicity">
Copper toxicity

Copperiedus refers to the consequences of an excess of copper in the body. Copperiedus can occur from eating acid foods cooked in uncoated copper cookware, or from exposure to excess copper in drinking water or other environmental sources.
Toxicity.
Copper in the blood exists in two forms: bound to ceruloplasmin (85–95%), and the rest "free", loosely bound to albumin and small molecules. Free copper causes toxicity, as it generates reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical. These damage proteins, lipids and DNA.
Symptoms and presentation.
Acute symptoms of copper poisoning by ingestion include vomiting, hematemesis (vomiting of blood), hypotension (low blood pressure), melena (black "tarry" feces), coma, jaundice (yellowish pigmentation of the skin), and gastrointestinal distress. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate deficiency may be at increased risk of hematologic effects of copper. Hemolytic anemia resulting from the treatment of burns with copper compounds is infrequent.
Chronic (long-term) effects of copper exposure can damage the liver and kidneys. Mammals have efficient mechanisms to regulate copper stores such that they are generally protected from excess dietary copper levels.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) in drinking water is 1.3 milligrams per liter. The MCL for copper is based on the expectation that a lifetime of consuming copper in water at this level is without adverse effect (gastrointestinal). The USEPA lists evidence that copper causes testicular cancer as "most adequate" according to the latest research at Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a limit of 0.1 mg/m3 for copper fumes (vapor generated from heating copper) and 1 mg/m3 for copper dusts (fine metallic copper particles) and mists (aerosol of soluble copper) in workroom air during an eight-hour work shift, 40-hour work week.
EPA cancer data.
The EPA lists no evidence for human cancer incidence connected with copper, and lists animal evidence linking copper to cancer as "inadequate". Two studies in mice have shown no increased incidence of cancer. One of these used regular injections of copper compounds, including cupric oxide. One study of two strains of mice fed copper compounds found a varying increased incidence of reticulum cell sarcoma in males of one strain, but not the other (there was a slightly increased incidence in females of both strains). These results have not been repeated.
Treatment.
In cases of suspected copper poisoning, penicillamine is the drug of choice, and dimercaprol, a heavy metal chelating agent, is often administered. Vinegar is not recommended to be given, as it assists in solubilizing insoluble copper salts. The inflammatory symptoms are to be treated on general principles, as are the nervous ones.
Cookware.
When acidic foods are cooked in unlined copper cookware, or in lined cookware where the lining has worn through, toxic amounts of copper can leach into the foods being cooked. This effect is exacerbated if the copper has corroded, creating reactive salts. Actual cooking may not be required for copper to leach into acidic liquids if they are stored in copper for a period of time. Many countries and states prohibit or restrict the sale of unlined copper cookware.
Copper oxide glaze on cups used for hot liquid might also be a concern, as well as copper pipes for conveying water to the home.
Non-sparking tools.
OSHA has set safety standards for grinding and sharpening copper and copper alloy tools, which are often used in nonsparking applications. These standards are recorded in the Code of Federal Regulations 29 CFR 1910.134 and 1910.1000.
Note: The most important nonsparking copper alloy is beryllium copper, and can lead to beryllium poisoning.
Drinking water.
With an of 30 mg/kg in rats, "gram quantities" of copper sulfate are potentially lethal in humans. The suggested safe level of copper in drinking water for humans varies depending on the source, but tends to be pegged at 2.0 mg/l.
Pathophysiology.
A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state. This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions, such as hydroxyl radical in a manner similar to Fenton chemistry. This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated, thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed oxidative stress, and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity.
Some of the effects of aging may be associated with excess copper. In addition, studies have found that people with mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, had heightened levels of copper in their systems. However, it is unknown at this stage whether the copper contributes to the mental illness, whether the body attempts to store more copper in response to the illness, or whether the high levels of copper are the result of the mental illness.
Indian childhood cirrhosis.
One manifestation of copper toxicity, cirrhosis of the liver in children (Indian childhood cirrhosis), has been linked to boiling milk in copper cookware. The Merck Manual states recent studies suggest that a genetic defect is associated with this particular cirrhosis.
Wilson's disease.
An inherited condition called Wilson's disease causes the body to retain copper, since it is not excreted by the liver into the bile. This disease, if untreated, can lead to brain and liver damage. 
Alzheimer’s disease.
Elevated free copper levels exist in Alzheimer's disease. Copper and zinc are known to bind to amyloid beta proteins in Alzheimer's disease. This bound form is thought to mediate the production of reactive oxygen species in the brain.
Aquatic life.
Too much copper in water may damage marine and freshwater organisms such as fish and molluscs. Fish species vary in their sensitivity to copper, with the LD50 for 96-h exposure to copper sulphate reported to be in the order of 58 mg per litre for Tilapia ("Oreochromis niloticus") and 70 mg per litre for catfish ("Clarias gariepinus") The chronic effect of sublethal concentrations of copper on fish and other creatures is damage to gills, liver, kidneys and the nervous system. It also interferes with the sense of smell in fish, thus preventing them from choosing good mates or finding their way to mating areas.
Bacteria.
Copper and copper alloys such as brass have been found to be toxic to bacteria via the oligodynamic effect. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but common to other heavy metals. Viruses are less susceptible to this effect than bacteria. Associated applications include the use of brass doorknobs in hospitals, which have been found to self-disinfect after eight hours, and mineral sanitizers, in which copper can act as an algicide. Overuse of copper sulfate as an algicide has been speculated to have caused a copper poisoning epidemic on Great Palm Island in 1979.

LB&amp;SCR Belgravia class

The LB&SCR Belgravia class, were 2-4-0 passenger locomotives designed by William Stroudley of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) in 1872 for secondary passenger duties.
History.
When William Stroudley took up his duties as Locomotive Superintendent at the Brighton works of the LB&SCR in 1870, he found that some locomotive components had been ordered by his predecessor, John Chester Craven. These included six sets of frames for some 2-4-0 passenger locomotives designed by Craven, and Stroudley produced a new design of 2-4-0 to use these frames.
The locomotives in this class were very similar to two 2-4-0 locomotives constructed at Cowlairs railway works for the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in the early 1860s when William Stroudley was the works manager and contained many features of his later designs.
Four "Belgravia" locomotives were constructed at Brighton works in 1872, two of which were rebuilds of earlier 2-2-2 locomotives built for the LB&SCR by Robert Stephenson and Company and Brighton works. The necessity to use components designed by Craven meant that the locomotives had a number of design features, such as the double frames and the 2-4-0 wheel arrangement, which were not found with Stroudley's later designs, and were the heaviest 2-4-0 locomotives of their time. Two further examples later appeared, one each in 1875 and 1876, these having detail differences from the first four. At first the class suffered from poor steaming, but once this was rectified they went on to give reliable service on secondary passenger trains as well as hauling the "business" expresses between Brighton and London Bridge until about 1881.
Under Stroudley's locomotive classification scheme, the "Belgravia" class, being "Main Line Express" engines, were included in Class B, along with most of his 0-4-2 locomotives, and one of his 2-2-2s. By the time that Class B was subdivided into B1, B2, etc. by D. E. Marsh, none of the "Belgravia" class remained in service.
Numbering.
The two rebuilds were no. 204 "Westminster" and no. 205 "Kensington". The two new engines of 1872 were no. 202 "Goodwood" and no. 201 "Belgravia". The 1875 loco was no. 206 "Carisbrooke", and that of 1876 was no. 207 "Freshwater". In 1897 the numbers were increased by 300; nos. 501 & 504 were withdrawn in February 1899, but the other four had their numbers increased by a further 100 later the same year. Nos. 605–7 were withdrawn in 1901, leaving no. 602 which was withdrawn in 1902. No examples have been preserved.

Gmail interface

The Gmail interface makes Gmail unique amongst webmail systems for several reasons. Most evident to users are its search-oriented features and means of managing e-mail in a "conversation view" that is similar to an Internet forum.
Programming.
Gmail makes use of Ajax, employing browser features such as JavaScript, keyboard access keys and Web feed integration.
Organization.
Users can construct "advanced searches" using either the Advanced Search interface or search operators in the search box. Search options include search for phrases, message sender, message location and message date. There are also undocumented search operators like "language:russian" that can be helpful.
Filters and labels.
Users can run filters by using an interface similar to the Search Options dialog. Gmail allows users to filter messages by their text; by their "From", "To", and "Subject" fields; and by whether or not the message has an attachment. Gmail can perform any combination of the following actions upon a message that meets a label's criteria:
To organize messages further, users can label e-mails. Labels provide a flexible method of categorizing e-mails since an e-mail may have any number of labels (in contrast to a system in which an e-mail may belong to only one folder). Users can display all e-mails having a particular label and can use labels as a search criterion. In addition, important e-mails can be flagged with a star, so that a user may find an important e-mail more quickly than searching through the entire inbox. In October 2010 Google introduced a "priority inbox" feature, which when activated classifies important mails automatically.
Beginning June 2013, Gmail allowed for the usage of tabs for automatically filtering emails by five general types:
Conversations.
Gmail recognizes related messages by subject and groups them into "conversations" where associated messages appear listed one after another, with the newest messages at the bottom. If a conversation has more than approximately 100 messages, it splits into separate sections. Reply or forwarded messages from some local (like local Yahoo! Mail) accounts split up conversations because their subjects contain parameters in the local language, instead of "Re" or "Fwd:". In response to some users' complaints, on Wednesday 29 September 2010 Google added the option of disabling conversation view from the options menu. Google software engineer Doug Che explained: "We really hoped everyone would learn to love conversation view, but we came to realize that it's just not right for some people."
Unlike other email web clients, Gmail does not permit users to see the size of an email message or to sort email (for example, alphabetically by subject).
Contacts.
Gmail automatically saves contact details when forwarding e-mails to a previously unknown recipient. If the user changes, adds, or removes information near an e-mail such as the name while sending any e-mail, it also updates that in the contact list, unless the user is using basic HTML view, designed for people with slower internet connections or browsers that do not support AJAX. When a user starts typing in the To, CC or BCC fields it brings up a list with the relevant contacts, with their name and primary e-mail address. More information, including alternate email addresses, can be added on the Contacts page. These contacts can also be added to a group, which makes sending multiple e-mails to related contacts easier. Images can be added to contacts, which will appear whenever the mouse is over the contact's name.
Users can import contacts (in several different ways) from Microsoft Office Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Eudora, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, orkut, and any other contact list in a CSV-format file. Gmail also allows a user to export their contacts to CSV.
Composition.
A year after Gmail was announced, Google introduced Rich Text Formatting, which allows the font size, color and text-alignment to be customized, as well as the embedding of bullet points and numbered lists.
Gmail also features Autosave — a system for avoiding loss of data in case of a browser crash or other error. During the composition of an e-mail, Gmail automatically saves a draft copy of the message and of any attachments. Although messages begin to be saved once a minute, saving times vary depending on the size of the message. Draft messages that are discarded are not recoverable.
Gmail places the cursor above quoted text when replying, which encourages top-posting. Regardless of the formatting of received messages, Gmail's conversation view defaults to showing only unique content, in chronological order.
Security.
At one time Gmail used an unencrypted connection to retrieve user data, encrypting only the connection used for the login page. However, by replacing the URL http://mail.google.com/mail/ with https://mail.google.com/mail/, users were able to force Gmail to use a secure connection, reducing the risk of third-party eavesdropping on users' information, such as emails and contacts, which are transmitted in plaintext as JavaScript data in the page source code. Starting in July 2008, it was possible to configure Gmail for HTTPS access only through the Settings option - this prevented any insecure access via HTTP. POP3 and IMAP access uses Transport Layer Security, or TLS. At present Gmail now defaults to a secure HTTPS connection.
Although email clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird use TLS when sending email, it is not used when the email is sent from the Gmail servers to the destination domain's mail exchangers, unless supported, so at some stage the user's email message may still be transmitted in unencrypted plain text.
Gmail offers spam filtering: the system automatically deletes messages marked as spam after 30 days. Users can disable the spam-filtering system by creating a rule to make all messages skip the spam filter. POP3 users can only check the Spam folder manually via the web interface, as only emails sent to the Inbox can be retrieved via POP3. This is a technical limitation of POP3. Currently about 75% of email sent to Gmail accounts is filtered as spam.
IP addresses of webmail Gmail users are disguised in order to protect security.
Gmail automatically scans all incoming and outgoing e-mails for viruses in e-mail attachments. If a virus is found on an attachment the reader is trying to open, Gmail will try to remove the virus and open the cleaned attachment. Gmail also scans all outgoing attachments and will prevent the message from being sent if a virus is found. Gmail also does not allow users to send or receive executable files or archives containing executable files.
Gmail became one of the first major e-mail providers to sign outgoing mails with Yahoo!'s DomainKeys signatures.
In the past, Gmail has had severe trouble with security which allowed a full account compromise via Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities affecting the google.com homepage or information disclosure through a file which was stored on Google's server and included all the Email contacts of the currently logged in user. The vulnerability was quickly patched after the initial disclosure on the Internet.
Addresses.
Gmail supports plus-addressing of e-mails. Users can send messages to addresses in the format username+extratext@gmail.com, where extratext can be any string, and will arrive in the inbox of username@gmail.com. This allows users to sign up for different services with different aliases and then easily filter all e-mails from those services. In addition, if users receive spam messages directed to an e-mail address with the extra text, they will know what services have leaked out their e-mail address. However, some websites do not accept email addresses containing "+", even though the mail-address specification permits use of them.
Gmail allows the user to add other email accounts to be used as optional sender addresses on outgoing email. The system carries out a verification process to confirm the user's ownership of each email address before it is added. "Plus-addresses" can also be added as sender addresses in a similar way. Moreover, any of the additional addresses can be set as the default address.
When using this feature, the address chosen will appear in the "From:" field of the message header. However, the SMTP envelope sender address will contain the name of the Gmail account used to send the message. Thus the underlying Gmail account address remains readily available: it will typically appear in a "Sender:" header field, or occasionally in the subject field. Some mail clients will write "From: "Sender"@gmail.com [mailto:"Sender"@gmail.com] On Behalf Of..." upon reply, making the situation very obvious.
Gmail does now allow users to specify a 3rd party SMTP server. Gmail can use this to send outgoing email for that particular account avoiding the masked account problem.
Optionally, users can set a different "Reply-to:" address for each "send as" address.
Gmail does not recognize dots as characters within a username. Instead, it will ignore all dots in a username. For instance, the account google@gmail.com receives mail sent to goo.gle@gmail.com, g.o.o.g.l.e@gmail.com, etc. Likewise, the account goo.gle@gmail.com receives mail sent to google@gmail.com. This can help in setting filters for incoming mail. Likewise, it is not necessary to include any of dots used in the creation of the account. Also this does not work in Google Apps for Your Domain. In Apps, each username variation must be entered as a nickname by the domain administrator.
Mail Fetcher.
In addition to adding extra email addresses, Gmail has a feature called "Mail Fetcher" that allows users to add up to five additional accounts to retrieve mail from via POP3. Once accounts are added, the program asks the user if they want to create a custom sender address automatically if they have not yet done so manually. This feature does not support retrieving mail from IMAP servers.
Product integration.
Google Talk, Google's service for instant messaging, can be accessed through a web-based interface on Gmail's site. The web-based interface is able to support voice and video calling and voice messages if the Google Talk client is running in the background. All messages are archived to the Chats mailbox in Gmail unless 'Off the Record' is enabled in Google Talk. If the fellow chatter suddenly has to go offline, any and all further messages sent will be delivered to that person via e-mail, including the entire conversation had previously. Another Google Talk integration feature is voicemail, where the message is sent to the recipient's Gmail inbox; as well as synchronizing contact pictures. On 4 December 2007, Google announced integration with AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), allowing Gmail users to log in to their AIM accounts and send instant messages to and see the online status of AIM users.
On 11 November 2008, Google announced video chat, which Gmail integrates into its web-based client. Windows XP, Vista or Intel-based Mac is required with a supported browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari 3+).
Google Calendar offered Gmail integration soon after its announcement on 13 April 2006. Events can be added while writing a message that get stored on the main Calendar interface. Recipients who use Gmail will then receive an invitation to the event, which they can accept or decline. Furthermore, Gmail attempts to recognize event dates and locations within e-mails, and gives users the option to add the event to a calendar, similar to Microsoft's Exchange Server.
Gmail offers further integration with some other Google products. Documents, spreadsheets and presentations can be opened using Google Docs, without downloading the file to a hard disk first. Also, pictures can be sent directly from Picasa using a Gmail account.
Gmail also offered integration of its now-defunct social networking and messaging tool Google Buzz. With this feature, Gmail users could share links, photos, videos, status messages and comments organized in "conversations" and visible in the user's inbox.
Browser support.
Desktop.
Gmail's "basic HTML" version will work on almost all browsers. The modern AJAX version is officially supported in the current and prior major releases of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari on a rolling basis.
Over the years, many officially unsupported browsers were able to use the AJAX interface using User agent spoofing or URL manipulation to trick Gmail into providing them with the AJAX version of the site. However, as the Gmail interface has become more advanced, it has become much harder to find alternatives that fully support the site's features.
Gmail also offers a "Basic HTML view". This allows users to access their Gmail messages from almost any computer running browsers that do not fully support the more advanced features (such as Internet Explorer 4.0+, Netscape 4.07+ or Opera 6.03+) or running browsers with JavaScript disabled.
Mobile.
Gmail has native applications for Apple's iOS devices (including iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) and for Google's Android devices. All other devices must use the Gmail Mobile web interface (minimum requirements) or a different email technology such as POP3 or IMAP.
Language support.
The Gmail interface currently supports 52 languages, which include most of the US English features, including: Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (UK), English (US), Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian (Bokmål), Oriya, Polish, Punjabi, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu and Vietnamese.
Applications.
Google has developed several subsidiary applications for Gmail.
Gmail Notifier was an official tool offered by Google which displayed a small icon in the notification area (see taskbar) in Microsoft Windows and on the right-hand side of the menu bar in Mac OS X, indicating the presence of new mail in the user's inbox. It also permitted Gmail to be designated as the default mail-client for "mailto" links. Linux users had a choice of several unofficial notifiers. As of 30 January 2014, Google discontinued the notifier.
On 10 February 2006 Google introduced "Gmail For Your Domain". All companies who participated in the beta testing gained permission to use Gmail throughout their own domains. Since then, Google has developed Google Apps, which includes customizable versions of Google Calendar, Google Page Creator and more. With various editions available, it targets enterprises as well as small businesses.
On 2 November 2006 Google began offering a mobile-application based version of its Gmail product for mobile phones capable of running Java applications. In addition, Sprint Nextel announced separately that it would make the application available from its Vision and Power Vision homepages and which it will preload onto some new Sprint phones. The application gives Gmail its own custom menu system: one much easier to navigate than a Web-based application running on a cell phone. Gmail's message threading also shows up clearly and the site displays attachments, such as photos and documents, in the application.
The Gmail interface supports drag and drop of attachments to and from the inbox. Users can add an attachment by dragging it into the mail window. Similarly an attachment can be downloaded by dragging the attachment from the message to the desktop.
Google Apps provider branding.
Google Apps Partner Edition, a service targeted at ISPs and portals, provides brand-customizable Gmail accounts, along with other Google services (such as Calendar and Docs).
Themes.
Google started offering users a choice of themes on 19 November 2008 and has 31 different themes, ranging from the original light blue color to designs with image backgrounds and transparencies. Many of these themes are dynamic, for instance the "Beach" or "Tree" themes change to reflect what time of day it is.
Changes in interface.
On 1 November 2011, Google rolled out an official redesign of its interface that "simplified" the look of Gmail into a more minimalist design to provide a more consistent look throughout its products and services as part of an overall design change. Users were able to preview the new interface design and beta-test for months prior to the official release as well as revert to the old interface until 27 March 2012, when Google discontinued the ability to revert.
Criticisms.
The conversation view groups related messages in a linear stack which a user can expand and collapse. Labelling (tagging) is limited to message threads.
Some users can experience difficulties when submitting e-mail addresses from the Gmail address book to the addressee line on the compose e-mail window. The "Autocomplete" feature can cause problems and does not work under all browsers or operating systems. However, it is possible to open the composed message in a new window so the address book can be opened, or another instance of Gmail can be opened in another window to access the address book. Gmail's current documented help on this issue states: "While Gmail doesn't currently support the functionality to open your Contacts list while composing a message, we're testing many new features to improve our service."
Although Gmail's advertisements have received praise for not obtruding, they can take up more space than Flash-based banners when up to six "sponsored links" appear next to an email. Additionally, when activated, opening emails makes the Web Clips RSS-feed bar display another sponsored link. Often the number of advertisements displayed in the Web Clips bar outnumbers the number of RSS feeds the user has requested. However, when a Gmail message is sent to another email address of a different provider, there will be no advertisements in the message unlike most other webmail providers.
When a Gmail mailbox reaches capacity, users can search for emails by size in order to delete the largest ones first. The web interface can help in this situation by searching for emails with attachments, but it does not indicate the sizes of those attachments.

<doc id="20358411" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20358411" title="Destination dispatch">
Destination dispatch

Destination dispatch is an optimization technique used for multi-elevator installations, which groups passengers for the same destinations into the same elevators, thereby reducing waiting and travel times when compared to a traditional approach where all passengers wishing to ascend or descend enter the same lift and then request their destination.
Using destination dispatch, passengers request travel to a particular floor using a keypad, touch screen or proximity card room-key prior in the lobby and are immediately directed to an appropriate elevator shaft.
Algorithms.
Based on information about the trips that passengers wish to make, the controller will dynamically allocate individuals to elevators to avoid excessive intermediate stops. Overall trip-times can be reduced by 25% with capacity up by 30%. 
Controllers can also offer different levels of service to passengers based on information contained in their key-cards. A high-privilege user may be allocated the nearest available elevator and always be guaranteed a direct service to their floor, and may be allocated an elevator with exclusive use; other users may be provided with extended door-opening times.
Limitations.
The smooth operation of a destination dispatch system depends upon each passenger indicating their destination intention separately. In most cases, the elevator system has no way of differentiating a group of passengers from a single passenger if the group's destination is only keyed in a single time. This could potentially lead to an elevator stopping to pick up more passengers than the elevator actually has capacity for, creating delays for other users.
Manufacturers.
Elevator manufacturers that offer destination dispatch include Otis Elevator, Kone Corporation, ThyssenKrupp, Schindler Group, Fujitec, Mitsubishi and Motion Control Engineering.

Target protein

Target proteins are functional biomolecules that are addressed and controlled by biologically active compounds. They are used in the processes of transduction, transformation and conjugation. The identification of target proteins, the investigation of signal transduction processes and the understanding of their interaction with ligands are key elements of modern biomedical research. Since the interaction with target proteins is the molecular origin of most drugs, their particular importance for molecular biology, molecular pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences is obvious. Target proteins control the action and the kinetic behavior of drugs within the organism. The elucidation of structure, conformational signaling and catalytic properties of particular target proteins facilitates a rational design of drugs and biotechnological processes. Known as biologicals, target proteins can also be drugs by themselves when their modification and formulation is emphasized within the pharmaceutical sciences. Finally, target protein - inducer interactions can be exploited for biomolecular transcription regulating systems in order to control for example gene therapeutic approaches.

Easy Java Simulations

EJS, or Easy Java Simulations, is an open-source software tool, part of the Open Source Physics project, designed for the creation of discrete computer simulations.
A discrete computer simulation, or simply a computer simulation, is a computer program that tries to reproduce, for pedagogical or scientific purposes, a natural phenomenon through the visualization of the different states that it can have. Each of these states is described by a set of variables that change in time due to the iteration of a given algorithm.
In creating a simulation with the help of EJS, the user does not program the simulation at the level of writing code, instead the user is working at a higher conceptual level, declaring and organizing the equations and other mathematical expressions that operate the simulation. EJS handles the technical aspects of coding the simulation in the Java programming language, thus freeing the user to concentrate on the simulation's content.
The generated Java code can, in terms of efficiency and sophistication, be taken as the creation of a professional programmer.
EJS is written in the Java programming language and the created simulation are in Java. Java Virtual Machines (JVM) are available for many different platforms; a platform for which a JVM is available can run Java programs. Java offers the possibility of creating Java Applets, most browsers support Java Applets.
EJS has its own format for storing the simulations, which is based on XML and carries the extension .xml. It contains not only the code for the simulation, but also the rest of the things, like the html introduction.

Donegal Carpets

Donegal Carpets is a trademark brand of handmade wool carpets produced in Killybegs, a town in County Donegal, Ireland. Donegal Carpets can be found in Dublin Castle, the Royal Pavilion of Brighton, Eltham Palace, and the U.S. White House as well as many other parts of the world.
History.
Although making carpets in Donegal is an ancient tradition, the company Donegal Carpets is but 100 odd years old and was founded in 1898 by Scottish textile manufacturer Alexander Morton. Before establishing Donegal Carpets, Morton had first established a carpet crafting house on the west coast of Ireland and put to practice the techniques of the Donegal people who had been working with wool for generations.
The first example of a Donegal carpet with Celtic designs was that carried out for the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for their offices at the Cork Exhibition in 1902. There is another earlier example, a small Celtic-ornamented altar carpet, a Morton's gift to the St Eunan's Cathedral, Letterkenny County, Donegal, which was opened in June 1901.The altar carpet was designed by Signor Oreste Amici, a roman painter, who carried out the Celtic ornamental painting in the St Columba Chapel in 1900.
The Mortons sold the company to a consortium called Donegal Carpets Ltd. in 1957. There were four manufacturing houses at one time in County Donegal but three of the four facilities closed during The Great Depression and in 1987 the last facility closed. Local Donegal people petitioned the government to help re-open them in 1997 and in 1999 they were making carpets again for places such as Áras an Uachtaráin, Dublin Castle and the University of Notre Dame.

Kathy Glover

Katherine Elizabeth "Kathy" Brookman (née Bates; previously Merrick, Tate and Glover) is a fictional character on the ITV soap opera "Emmerdale", She was played by Malandra Burrows. as a regular character from 1985 until she was axed in 2001 by series producer Steve Frost.
In October 2005 series producer Kathleen Beedles reintroduced the character, when Burrows reprised the role briefly for the funeral of Seth Armstrong. Kathy currently serves as the seventeenth longest running character in the history of the show.
Character development.
In July 2005 it was announced that Burrows agreed to reprise her role for the funeral of Seth Armstrong. [...]"Burrows was one of the most popular characters on Emmerdale," an insider told the "Sunday Mirror", "Her return is a huge coup."[...] .
Storylines.
1985-2001.
Born in 1967, Kathy Bates arrived in Emmerdale with her mother, Caroline, and brother, Nick, in 1985, following her parents’ separation. She was studying for her ‘A’ levels, but left school when Alan Turner gave her a job at NY Estates as a farm worker. She was put in charge of the poultry unit at Home Farm, where thousands of battery hens were reared. Eventually, it became too much for her and she walked out - which didn’t surprise Joe Sugden, who had advised against her appointment all along. She worked part-time at Emmerdale Farm and in 1988, set up a farm shop with Dolly Skilbeck and helped make goats' cheese. Kathy was also a keen horsewoman and looked after Joe and Alan’s horses. 
Her relationship with Jackie Merrick lasted for three years before they finally decided to marry, his impulsive nature in marked contrast to Kathy’s easy-going style. When they broke up in 1987, she went out with Tony Marchant, a rich relative of NY boss Christopher Meadows. This made Jackie so jealous that he smashed up his van and pleaded with Kathy to return to him. She agreed and they became engaged, marrying in February 1988. The wedding was almost ruined when a burst water tank in the Bates’ cottage destroyed Kathy’s dress, the night before. The day was saved when Annie, Dolly and Caroline altered Annie’s own wedding dress - an Edwardian one worn by her own mother - which Kathy wore instead. Kathy and Jackie went on honeymoon to Tunisia and, despite unexpected adventures, enjoyed themselves. 
The Merricks began married life in the attic at Emmerdale Farm and were delighted when Joe offered them Demdyke in December 1988. They were always struggling financially, however, on Jackie’s meagre wage, supplemented by Kathy’s earnings as part-time barmaid at the Woolpack. Her hours clashed with Jackie’s, so she gave it up. 
Jackie’s death, in August 1989, devastated Kathy. She took his job as a farm labourer at Emmerdale, as well as running their own of rented land at Home Farm, until new landlord Frank Tate evicted her in January 1990. She was particularly involved with the sheep - both 40 of her own and 650 of Emmerdale’s - despite miscarrying in 1989 due to the sheep-related disease Chiamydia psittaci.
For several months she lost interest in everything, and only began to come out of her shell when she reluctantly joined the cast of the village play, Dracula, in January 1990. By this time, Chris Tate was keen, but she initially rejected his advances. George Starkey, a lorry-driver who also tried to date her, brought news that a cafe owner in Southampton, who was also a medium, had a message from her dead husband. Kathy went to Southampton, despite much advice not to take such things seriously but the inconclusive experience made her decide to get on with her life. 
By this time, Chris Tate was becoming more important to her and their relationship flourished. In April 1990, they spent the night together and in May, much to his surprise and delight, she moved in with him at Home Farm. Any misgivings she may have had about this were heightened when Chris bought her a car after her old Citroen was written off by Rachel Hughes, to whom she was giving a driving lesson. Kathy's experiences had made her the more mature of the two, and Chris’s belief that expensive gifts could solve differences would be the cause of many disagreements through their marriage. Another present - this time, from father-in-law Frank - was their matrimonial home at Mill Cottage, though the couple eventually insisted on paying him for it. No matter how agreeable the surroundings, Kathy was never one for staying at home, much as Chris would have liked her to become a full-time wife and mother. A period of filling in as her husband’s secretary saw her prove the point as she secretly gained her HGV licence, celebrating by backing a giant truck into a space outside the office as Chris looked on open-mouthed! She then went on to look after Kim’s horses at Home Farm before the discovery of her boss’s affair with Neil Kincaid put her in an impossible position and she quit, taking up her friend Lynn Whiteley’s offer to help her run the wine bar at the Woolpack, but Chris was opposed to this - not least due to Lynn’s oft-expressed low opinion of him. In 1993, Kathy’s frustration with her husband’s attitudes and activities would lead to a brief dalliance with American wine rep Josh Lewis. She was on the point of eloping with him but on learning that Chris had been found injured in the wreckage of the Woolpack following the plane crash brought her back to her ‘senses’, and, like the dutiful wife she felt she should be, Kathy prepared herself for life with a wheelchair-bound husband in a purpose-built bungalow organized, inevitably, by her father-in-law. 
In 1994, Chris and Kathy's marriage ended when he began an affair with Rachel Hughes and got her pregnant but she was present when Rachel went into labour and they rebuilt their friendship. In 1995, Kathy divorced Chris and used her divorce settlement money to buy the old school tearooms in Emmerdale. Moving on from Chris, Kathy started a relationship with Dave Glover, one of the Tates' employees. However, Dave too had been seeing somebody else - Kathy's former stepmother-in-law, Kim Tate. When Kim went back to Frank, Kathy and Dave reunited and married on 28 November 1996 but it wasn't long before Dave was seeing Kim again. Kim and Dave planned to run away with her son, James, believing that Dave was the father. Dave died in a fire at Home Farm on Boxing Day 1996, trying to save the baby that he thought was his. James eventually turned out to be Frank's child.
In 1999, Kathy was ditched at the altar by her 4th fiancé Biff Fowler (Dave's former brother-in-law). Kathy was subject to many disasters. She was involved in the plane crash, when Chris's injuries meant he needed a wheelchair. She was run over, as Kim and her second husband, Steve Marchant, stole a horse from the Tates. She was subject to an attempted murder by Graham Clark, who had previously killed Kathy's best friend, Rachel. She was also involved in the accident which killed Butch Dingle when the community bus was hit by the Tate Haulage lorry. Kathy was then imprisoned for protesting against the Haulage company owned by her ex-husband. In 2000, when Jack Sugden was arrested for the murder of his estranged wife, Sarah, Kathy moved into the farm to look after Jack's children, Andy, Robert and Victoria. Kathy nearly had a mental breakdown when Robert and Andy would not stop arguing and the herd of cows contracted tuberculosis. Kathy left Emmerdale in December 2001 to go to Australia with her niece, Alice Bates, when Alice's mother Elsa Chappell wanted her to emigrate. While in Australia, in December 2002, news got back to Emmerdale that she had given birth to a healthy girl. 
By 2003, Kathy's first three husbands had all died, although she had divorced Chris Tate years before he committed suicide.
2005.
Kathy returned in 2005 when she was accompanying Seth Armstrong back to living with his long-term companion, Betty Eagleton. However, Seth died on the flight back to the UK so Kathy stayed for the funeral before returning to Australia. Kathy's ex-boyfriend and former fiance, Biff, also returned but they did not speak to each other. 
It is now presumed that Kathy was married again in Australia as her surname at her last appearance was Brookman but the name of her Australian husband and daughter are unknown. In December 2006, Alan Turner flew out to Australia and visited Kathy for a month. He visited again for the first half of 2008.

Captain Tony's Saloon

Captain Tony's Saloon is a bar located at 428 Greene Street (eastern street side), in Key West, Florida, United States. 
The bar has been patronized through the years by many well-known artists, writers and celebrities. In fact, an interesting feature of the bar is that when any celebrity visits, a barstool is added with that patron's name. You will find barstools painted with the names of famous people such as Ernest Hemingway, Truman Capote, Duane Cahill, Jimmy Buffett, Shel Silverstein, John Prine and even John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman, among others.
Above the sign outside the building is a large Jewfish that Captain Tony caught and had preserved. It is said that if you throw a quarter into the mouth of the fish, good luck will follow you until you leave the island.
History.
The building housing Captain Tony's Saloon has a history as colorful as the town of Key West itself. When first constructed in 1852, 428 Greene Street was an ice house that doubled as the city morgue. In the 1890s, it housed a wireless telegraph station. The telegraph's most important utilization came in 1898, during the Spanish-American War. The battleship Maine was destroyed, as the news came from Havana to Key West and it was reported all over the world from this building.In 1912, the building was home to a cigar factory. Later, it was a bordello and a bar popular with the Navy until it was forced out of business. After that, it became several speakeasies, the last of which was named The Blind Pig, specializing in gambling, women, and bootleg rum.
By the 1930s, a local named Josie Russell bought the business and created Sloppy Joe's Bar. This was where Ernest Hemingway spent most of his evenings between 1933 and 1937. In 1938, when the building's landlord raised the rent one dollar per week, Russell and his customers picked up the entire bar and moved everything to Sloppy Joe's current location at 201 Duval Street. The bar then went through several iterations until 1958, when Captain Tony Tarracino, a local charter boat captain, purchased the bar and named it Captain Tony's Saloon. As Captain Tony's, the bar is where Jimmy Buffett got his start in Key West. Buffett played Capt. Tony's in the early '70s, and was often paid in tequila. Buffett immortalized the bar, & Tarracino himself, in his song "Last Mango in Paris". On occasion, Jimmy will make surprise appearances at the bar, but only performs at his own place around the corner called Margaritaville Cafe.
Tarracino sold the bar in 1989, but continued to appear there most Thursdays to greet customers and fans until his death in November of 2008.

Scottish Lullaby

Scottish Lullaby is a traditional melody that comes from the clans of the Scottish Highlands. Only the air Cdul gu lo (Sleep on till dawn) and not the original Scottish verses were used when a dramatization of Sir Walter Scott’s Guy Mannering was presented. For this, Sir Walter Scott composed the verses ‘Lullaby for an Infant Child’. 
The history of the Highlands and the wars by which the clans were able to preserve their independence are evoked in this first song for an infant. The dream is of the trumpet and the ideal is manhood. The lines of this lullaby are familiar to English speakers as a nursery rhyme. They are a curtailed version of Sir Walter Scott’s verses.

Sybil Jason

Sybil Jason, Sybil Jacobson, (23 November 1927 - 23 August 2011) was a motion-picture child actress who, in the late 1930s, was presented as a rival to Shirley Temple.
Career.
Born in Cape Town, South Africa, she began playing the piano at age two and, a year later, began making public appearances doing impersonations of Maurice Chevalier. She was introduced to the theatre-going public of London by way of her uncle, Harry Jacobson, a then-popular London orchestra leader and also pianist to Gracie Fields. The apex of her career came with a concert performance with Frances Day at London's Palace Theatre. Jason's theatre work led to appearances on radio and phonograph records, and a supporting role in the film "Barnacle Bill" (1935).
Irving Asher, the head of Warner Bros.' London studio, saw Jason's performance in "Barnacle Bill" and subsequently arranged for her to make a screen test for the studio. The test was a success, resulting in Warner Bros. signing her to a contract. Her American film debut came as the lead in "Little Big Shot" (1935), directed by Michael Curtiz and co-starring Glenda Farrell, Robert Armstrong, and Edward Everett Horton. Jason followed this with supporting roles opposite some of Warner Bros. most popular stars, including Kay Francis in "I Found Stella Parish" (1935), Al Jolson in "The Singing Kid" (1936), Pat O'Brien and Humphrey Bogart in "The Great O'Malley" (1937), and again with Kay Francis in "Comet Over Broadway" (1938). Warners also starred her in "The Captain's Kid" (1937), and four Vitaphone two-reelers filmed in Technicolor: "Changing of the Guard", "A Day at Santa Anita", "Little Pioneer," and "The Littlest Diplomat."
Jason, however, never became the major rival to Shirley Temple that Warner Bros. had hoped for and, her film career ended after playing two supporting roles at 20th-Century Fox. These films — "The Little Princess" (1939) and "The Blue Bird" (1940) — were in support of Temple, who became her lifelong friend. 
Personal life.
Jason married Anthony Drake on 31 December 1947. He died in 2005. Their daughter, Toni, is married to Phillip W. Rossi, producer of "The New Price is Right".

In 1991 the original tank was 12 liters, which became 13 in 1994 and 14 in 1995; the original carburator was a Dell'Orto VHSB 39, which was upgraded to a Dell'Orto VHSD 41 in 1996 and to a Dell'Orto VHSG 42 in 2006.
Since 1996 the brake specification has gone from a single front brake disc 300 mm in carbon steel to a single brake in carbon, with a diameter of 275 mm disc; in 2000 the bike returned to a double disc front braking system .
Since 2007, the bike is available in a new version, called RSA 125, for some riders. The RSA has many new details than the previous model, including improvements in the intake system and the engine. The old version, with some updates from the RSA, is still used as a customer bike and it's called the RS 125 LE.
The RSA (and the "evolution" version of the RS 125) are used not only by Aprilia, but also by Gilera and Derbi (rebranded as such), since all three brands belong to the Piaggio group.

Claes Oldenburg

Claes Oldenburg (born January 28, 1929) is an American sculptor, best known for his public art installations typically featuring very large replicas of everyday objects. Another theme in his work is soft sculpture versions of everyday objects. Many of his works were made in collaboration with his wife, Coosje van Bruggen, who died in 2009 after 32 years of marriage. Oldenburg lives and works in New York.
Early life and education.
Claes Oldenburg was born on January 28, 1929 in Stockholm, the son of Gösta Oldenburg and his wife Sigrid Elisabeth née Lindforss. His father was then a Swedish diplomat stationed in New York and in 1936 was appointed Consul General of Sweden to Chicago where Oldenburg grew up, attending the Latin School of Chicago. He studied literature and art history at Yale University from 1946 to 1950, then returned to Chicago where he took classes at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. While further developing his craft, he worked as a reporter at the City News Bureau of Chicago. He also opened his own studio and, in 1953, became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1956, he moved to New York, working part-time in the library of the Cooper Union Museum for the Arts of Decoration.
Work.
Oldenburg's first recorded sales of artworks were at the 57th Street Art Fair in Chicago, where he sold 5 items for a total price of $25. He moved back to New York City in 1956. There he met a number of artists, including Jim Dine, Red Grooms, and Allan Kaprow, whose Happenings incorporated theatrical aspects and provided an alternative to the abstract expressionism that had come to dominate much of the art scene. Oldenburg began toying with the idea of soft sculpture in 1957, when he completed a free-hanging piece made from a woman's stocking stuffed with newspaper. (The piece was untitled when he made it but is now referred to as "Sausage".)
In 1959, Oldenburg started to make figures, signs and objects out of papier-mâché, sacking and other rough materials, followed in 1961 by objects in plaster and enamel based on items of food and cheap clothing. Oldenburg's first show that included three-dimensional works, in May 1959, was at the Judson Gallery, at Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square. During this time, artist Robert Beauchamp described Oldenburg as "brilliant," due to the reaction that the pop artist brought to a "dull" abstract expressionist period.
In the 1960s Oldenburg became associated with the Pop Art movement and created many so-called "happenings", which were performance art related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was "Ray Gun Theater". The cast of colleagues who appeared in his performances of included artists Lucas Samaras, Tom Wesselman, Carolee Schneemann, Oyvind Fahlstrom and Richard Artschwager, dealer Annina Nosei, critic Barbara Rose, and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer. His first wife (1960–1970) Patty Mucha, who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, was a constant performer in his happenings. This brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature, art dealt with "profound" expressions or ideas. But Oldenburg's spirited art found first a niche then a great popularity that endures to this day. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan's Lower East Side to house "The Store," a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculptures roughly in the form of consumer goods.
Oldenburg moved to Los Angeles in 1963 "because it was the most opposite thing to New York I could think of". That same year, he conceived "AUT OBO DYS", performed in the parking lot of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in December 1963. In 1965 he turned his attention to drawings and projects for imaginary outdoor monuments. Initially these monuments took the form of small collages such as a crayon image of a fat, fuzzy teddy bear looming over the grassy fields of New York's Central Park (1965) and "Lipsticks in Piccadilly Circus, London" (1966). In 1967, New York city cultural adviser Sam Green realized Oldenburg's first outdoor public monument; "Placid Civic Monument" took the form of a Conceptual performance/action behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, with a crew of gravediggers digging a 6-by-3-foot rectangular hole in the ground. In 1969, Oldenberg contributed a drawing to the Moon Museum.
Many of Oldenburg's large-scale sculptures of mundane objects elicited public ridicule before being embraced as whimsical, insightful, and fun additions to public outdoor art.needed Sculptures, though quite large, often have interactive capabilities. One such interactive early sculpture was a soft sculpture of a tube of lipstick which would deflate unless a participant re-pumped air into it. In 1974, this sculpture, "Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks," was redesigned in a sturdier aluminum form, the giant lipstick being placed vertically atop tank treads. Originally installed in Beinecke Plaza at Yale, it now resides in the Morse College courtyard.
From the early 1970s Oldenburg concentrated almost exclusively on public commissions. His first public work, "Three-Way Plug" came on commission from Oberlin College with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. His collaboration with Dutch/American writer and art historian Coosje van Bruggen dates from 1976. Their first collaboration came when Oldenburg was commissioned to rework "Trowel I", a 1971 sculpture of an oversize garden tool, for the grounds of the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, the Netherlands. Oldenburg has officially signed all the work he has done since 1981 with both his own name and van Bruggen's. In 1988, the two created the iconic "Spoonbridge and Cherry" sculpture for the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota that remains a staple of the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden as well as a classic image of the city. "Typewriter Eraser, Scale X" (1999) is in the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden. Another well known construction is the Free Stamp in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. This Free Stamp has an energetic cult following.
In addition to freestanding projects, they occasionally contributed to architectural projects, among them two Los Angeles projects in collaboration with architect Frank O. Gehry: "Toppling Ladder With Spilling Paint", which was installed at Loyola Law School in 1986, and "Binoculars, Chiat/Day Building", completed in Venice in 1991;. The couple's collaboration with Gehry also involved a return to performance for Oldenburg when the trio presented "Il Corso del Coltello", in Venice, Italy, in 1985; other characters were portrayed by 
Germano Celant and Pontus Hultén. "Coltello" is the source of "Knife Ship," a large-scale sculpture that served as the central prop; it was later seen in Los Angeles in 1988 when Oldenburg, Van Bruggen and Gehry presented "Coltello Recalled: Reflections on a Performance" at the Japanese American Cultural & Community Center and the exhibition "Props, Costumes and Designs for the Performance "Il Corso del Coltello"" at Margo Leavin Gallery.
In 2001, Oldenburg and van Bruggen created 'Dropped Cone', a huge inverted ice cream cone, on top of a shopping center in Cologne, Germany. Installed at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 2011, "Paint Torch" is a towering 53-foot-high pop sculpture of a paintbrush, capped with bristles that are illuminated at night. The sculpture is installed at a daring 60-degree angle, as if in the act of painting.
Exhibitions.
Oldenburg’s first one-man show in 1959, at the Judson Gallery in New York, included figurative drawings and papier-mâché sculptures. He was honored with a solo exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet (organized by Pontus Hultén), in 1966; the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1969; and with a retrospective organized by Germano Celant at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 1995 (travelling to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Bonn; and Hayward Gallery, London). In 2002 the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York held a retrospective of the drawings of Oldenburg and Van Bruggen; the same year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York exhibited a selection of their sculptures on the roof of the museum.
Oldenburg is represented by The Pace Gallery in New York and Margo Leavin Gallery in Los Angeles.
Recognition.
In 1989, Oldenburg won the Wolf Prize in Arts. In 2000, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. Oldenburg has also received honorary degrees from Oberlin College, Ohio, in 1970; Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois, in 1979; Bard College, New York, in 1995; and Royal College of Art, London, in 1996, as well as the following awards: Brandeis University Sculpture Award, 1971; Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture, 1972; Art Institute of Chicago, First Prize Sculpture Award, 72nd American Exhibition, 1976; Medal, American Institute of Architects, 1977; Wilhelm-Lehmbruck Prize for Sculpture, Duisburg, Germany, 1981; Brandeis University Creative Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, The Jack I. and Lillian Poses Medal for Sculpture, 1993; Rolf Schock Foundation Prize, Stockholm, Sweden, 1995.

In her 16-minute, 16mm film "Manhattan Mouse Museum" (2011), artist Tacita Dean captured Oldenburg in his studio as he gently handles and dusts the small objects that line his bookshelves. The film is less about the artist’s iconography than the embedded intellectual process that allows him to transform everyday objects into remarkable sculptural forms.
Personal life.
Patty Mucha was Oldenburg's first wife, from 1960 to 1970. She was a constant performer in Oldenburg's happenings and performed with The Druds.
Between 1969 and 1977, Oldenburg was in a relationship with the feminist artist and sculptor, Hannah Wilke, who died in 1993. They shared several studios and traveled together, and Wilke often photographed him.
Oldenburg and his second wife, Coosje van Bruggen, met in 1970 when Oldenburg’s first major retrospective traveled to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, where van Bruggen was a curator. They were married in 1977.
In 1992 Oldenburg and van Bruggen acquired Château de la Borde, a small Loire Valley chateau, whose music room gave them the idea of making a domestically sized collection. Van Bruggen and Oldenburg renovated the house, decorating it with modernist pieces by Le Corbusier, Charles and Ray Eames, Alvar Aalto, Frank Gehry, Eileen Gray. Van Bruggen died on January 10, 2009, from the effects of breast cancer.
Oldenburg's brother, art historian Richard E. Oldenburg, was director of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, between 1972 and 1993, and later chairman of Sotheby's America.
Art market.
Oldenburg's sculpture "Typewriter Eraser" (1976), the third piece from an edition of three, was sold for $2.2 million at Christie's New York in 2009.

Mongo (horse)

Mongo (1959–1983) was an American Champion Thoroughbred racehorse who was most notable for his performances in turf races.
Background.
He was bred and raced by Marion duPont Scott, a member of the prominent Du Pont family. His sire was imported British stallion Royal Charger, a son of Nearco whom "Thoroughbred Heritage" says was "one of the greatest racehorses of the Twentieth Century". Mongo's dam was Accra, Ms. Du Pont Scott's foundation mare, who produced at least seven other winners including the three-time American Champion Steeplechase Horse Neji.
Racing career.
Frank Bonsal, a former jockey in steeplechase racing, conditioned Mongo for racing. As a three-year-old in 1962, the colt won important races on turf under jockey Charlie Burr. He notably won the Lexington Handicap, the first of two consecutive runnings of both the United Nations Handicap and the Trenton Handicap. The following year was Mongo's most successful. On November 11 he met the reigning American Horse of the Year Kelso as well as challengers from France, Ireland, Hungary, Venezuela and Russia in the Washington, D.C. International Stakes. The race evolved into a match between Mongo and Kelso throughout the last half mile. On the line Mongo prevailed by half a length, but his win was only confirmed after the track stewards rejected a claim of interference brought by Ismail Valenzuela the rider of the runner-up. As a result of his successes Mongo was voted the 1963 American Champion Male Turf Horse. 
Mongo also raced successfully at age five. He defeated Kelso again to win the 1964 Monmouth Handicap, defeated the outstanding runner Gun Bow in the John B. Campbell Handicap, and set a new Monmouth Park track record in winning the Trenton Handicap for the second time.
Stud career.
Retired to stud at Blue Ridge Farm near Upperville, Virginia, Mongo met with modest success. While none of his progeny met with his level of racing success, Mongo sired some good runners including:
Mongo died at age twenty-four on March 21, 1983, at Blue Ridge Farm.

Tocklai Experimental Station

The Tocklai Experimental Station was established in 1911, at a site provided by the Jorehaut Tea Company located near the river Tocklai in Jorhat, Assam. The initial construction of a laboratory and two bungalows was funded by industry, subsidized by the national government of India, and the Indian states of Assam and Bengal.
The beginning of a new era of tea research in India was marked by the establishment of the Scientific Department of Indian Tea Association (ITA) in the year 1900. This was consolidated with the creation of the Tocklai Experimental Station in 1911. The formation of the Tea Research Association (TRA) in 1964 with Tocklai at the centre of all activities further expanded the horizon of tea research to cover the entire Northeast India. Research on all aspects of tea cultivation and processing is carried out at Tocklai Experimental station, Jorhat the oldest and the largest research station of its kind in the world. Transfer of technology to its member estates is carried out through its advisory network covering 1,076 tea estates occupying of land spread over The South Bank, North Bank, Upper Assam, Cachar, Tripura, Dooars, Darjeeling and Terai. Tocklai has its substation at Nagrakata.

British and Commonwealth Holdings

British and Commonwealth Holdings plc was a financial services company which used to be a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
History.
The Company was originally established in 1955 when Clan Line Steamers was merged with Union Castle to form The British & Commonwealth Shipping Company, a shipping business.
British & Commonwealth were the ultimate owners of British United Airways (BUA), Britain's largest wholly private, independent airline of the 1960s, as well as its subsidiaries and sister companies, including British United Air Ferries and British United Island Airways (BUIA). They were also a shareholder of Bristow Helicopters, at the time the UK's biggest helicopter company as well as one of the largest in the world, acquiring full control in 1985.
In 1969 British and Commonwealth Shipping, Furness Withy, P&O and The Ocean Steamship Company established Overseas Containers Limited to exploit containerisation.
In late 1970 British & Commonwealth sold BUA along with three new BAC One-Eleven 500 aircraft it had leased to the airline to Caledonian Airways for £12m. It continued to own BUIA, which had changed its name to British Island Airways (BIA) in July 1970.
1980s Boom And Bust.
In the 1980s, new management under one John Gunn oversaw rapid expansion in financial services. This wasn't a totally new area for the company: it had established fund managers Gartmore in 1969. Multiple acquisitions included Exco International, a UK money brokering business in 1986, and Oppenheimer, a large American fund management company.
At its height, the company was said to be "the largest financial services company in the UK, if the 4 high-street banks are excluded". Favourable profiles in the business press culminated in John Gunn being awarded the accolade "Guardian Young Businessman Of The Year".
In 1988 it acquired Atlantic Computers plc, a computer services business for £434m, having first built up a stake in that company by way of a series of market purchases. The acquisition proved ruinous – "accounting irregularities" were discovered in Atlantic's books: the company had been giving away free computer time to clients, but writing up said time as if paid for at the market rate.
Both acquiror and acquiree subsequently went into administration (the former in 1990, the latter during the late 1990s) Until its collapse, British & Commonwealth had also been the majority shareholder of Air UK, at the time the UK's largest regional airline and BIA's successor, and also Servisair the airline and cargo ground handling company based, at the time, in Bramhall.

Gold Spike Hotel and Casino

Gold Spike Hotel and Casino is a boutique 112-room, seven floor hotel-casino, connected with the Oasis at the Gold Spike, a 50-room three floor hotel located in downtown Las Vegas. It was owned by entrepreneur Tony Hsieh and his Downtown Project, having just bought it from The Siegel Group; and the casino was operated by Golden Gaming.
Hsieh closed the casino on April 14, 2013. After a three-week remodel, Gold Spike re-opened as a restaurant and bar on May 6, 2013.
History.
It originally opened in 1976 as the 112-room "Rendezvous". In 1983 Jackie Gaughan purchased the property after it had been closed for several months. The Gold Spike for years has been known as an inexpensive hotel with few amenities.
On December 6, 2002, Gaughan agreed to sell the Gold Spike and three other casinos to Barrick Gaming. This sale, along with several other downtown Las Vegas hotel/casinos, was completed in 2004, for a combined total of about $82 million.
Barrick Gaming Corp was in partnership with Tamares Group. After the purchase, management discontinued the table games and only offered slot machines. In a few years the property was offered for sale.
On July 23, 2007, Greg Covin bought the property for $15.6 million with the intention of turning it into a boutique hotel.
He sold it on February 4, 2008 for $21 million to The Siegel Group.
The Siegel Group set out to completely renovate the property and combine it with an old and forgotten 52-room motel located next to the property. As one author wrote, the Gold Spike now has "Quartz walls, tile floors, wood accents, and new everything", making it "a very modern boutique hotel in the heart of downtown". The first floor, containing the gaming floor, the bar, and the restaurant, was completely renovated by February 2009.
By April 2010, all guest floors and the exterior of the hotel has been completely remodeled and renovated. In May 2010, the Oasis Pool opened, giving Gold Spike a swimming pool.
In April 2013, it was reported that the property's debt had been acquired by Tony Hsieh's Downtown Project, a campaign to revitalize downtown Las Vegas. Siegel then announced that it had sold the Gold Spike to the Downtown Project, and that the casino would close on April 14. Siegel retained rights to the Gold Spike name, and said that the company needed to dispose of smaller properties on its way to owning larger casinos on the Strip. Hsieh was reported to be considering several ideas for the property, including a boutique hotel, specialty retail space, or a club, but ruled out a casino, saying that he was "trying to help build a community".
Oasis at The Gold Spike.
The adjacent 3-story motel was originally built in 1962 as a 57-room Travel Inn Motel. The property was abandoned, becoming a blight between the Fremont Street Experience and Las Vegas City Hall. The Siegel Group purchased this property in August 2007 for $5 million and started making plans to renovate it and reopen the property. Plans were put on hold when they purchased the neighboring Gold Spike. Finally, by April 2010, the rooms had been completely renovated and renamed "The Oasis at The Gold Spike" and connected to the Gold Spike via an outdoor lounge and walkway. After a reconfiguration of the property, it was left with 50-rooms, which have been modernized and turned into bungalow suites.
The Oasis at the Gold Spike had the distinction of being the only downtown hotel with a Las Vegas Blvd. address. In May 2010, the City of Las Vegas changed the entire Gold Spike property to this address.

Rialto Police Department

The Rialto Police Department is the primary law enforcement agency in Rialto, in San Bernardino County, California. It offers services including Patrol, K-9 Unit and School resource officers. It was founded on November 17, 1911.
Attempt to disband.
The department was almost disbanded in early 2007 when, at the request of their mayor, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department was asked to provide a contract for police services, thinking that the officers (who were already suffering from low morale and pay) would immediately jump at the chance to be sheriff's deputies (complete with better training and pay). The mayor didn't expect any negative reaction at all from the residents, as well as then-Sheriff-Coroner Gary Penrod. After a few months of back-and-forth negotiations between the officers' union and the city's mayor, the department was saved from abolition.
Controversy.
In 2005, then police chief Michael Meyers resigned after members of the police union in the city had taken a vote of no-confidence in he and his deputy, Arthur Burgess.
In 2010, an employee of the Spearmint Rhino gentlemen's club filed a claim for $500,000 against the city of Rialto alleging that Rialto police officers had, while on-duty as well as while off-duty, engaged in sexual relations with strip club employees at the Rialto Police Union hall. At times group sex between Rialto cops and Spearmint Rhino employees occurred at the union hall. The plaintiff, Nancy Holtgreve, alleged that she was physically and verbally harassed by former Rialto police officer James Dobbs when she learned that he had impregnated her. Officer LaMont Corker testified in support of a claim filed by Dobbs for a restraining order against Holtgreve which San Bernardino Superior Court denied. Two officers, including officer Dobbs, resigned from the department in the wake of the scandal
In 2011, Rialto police shot and killed a man who had been charging them with a brick. Also in 2011, a Rialto policeman was indicted on federal bribery charges for accepting a $2500 bribe. He was charged along with an Orange County lawyer for falsely claiming that a witness had "provided substantial assistance" to the DEA.
In May 2012, a police officer was charged for engaging in sex with an underaged female.
Fallen officers.
Since the establishment of the Rialto Police Department, two officers have died in the line of duty.

Dona Drake (November 15, 1914 – June 20, 1989) was an American singer, dancer and film actress in the 1930s and 1940s. She was born Eunice Westmoreland in Miami, Florida, in 1914. Entering show business in the 1930s, she used the names Una Velon, Rita Rio and Rita Shaw. She settled on the stage name Dona Drake in the early 1940s. Studio publicity during her heyday incorrectly stated that Drake was of Mexican origin and was born Rita Novella. (Novella was actually her mother's first name.)
Because of her dark hair and Latin-looking features, Drake generally played Latin or other "ethnic" types. She is perhaps best known for playing the American Indian maid of Bette Davis in "Beyond the Forest". She also appeared as an Arab girl opposite Bob Hope in "Road to Morocco" in 1942. Her biggest "non-ethnic" role was the second female lead in the 1949 comedy "The Girl from Jones Beach", playing opposite Eddie Bracken. She died in 1989.

Biography.
Nikephoros Vrettakos was born in the village of Krokees (Κροκεές), near Sparta, Laconia but originated from Mani and published his first collection of poems, "Under Shadows and Lights", in 1929, at the age of seventeen. That same year he moved to Athens to attend university, but left after a year to take a series of jobs as a clerk in various businesses. In 1937 he began a thirty year career in the Greek Civil Service, also seeing combat service in the Greco-Italian War during this period. In 1967 he responded to the takeover of Greece by a military dictatorship by going into self-imposed exile in Switzerland and Italy, where he remained until returning to Greece in 1974. He also wrote a poem about Kostas Georgakis, the student who set himself ablaze in Genoa as a protest against the junta.
Nikephoros Vretttakos was considered one of Greece's most important poets. He won a number of prizes and medals, including the Greek State Poetry Prize twice.

Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2009

The Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2009 was the seventh edition of Junior Eurovision Song Contest and took place in Kiev, Ukraine. It was scheduled for 21 November.
13 countries were confirmed by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to compete in the Contest.
The contest was won by Ralf Mackenbach for the Netherlands with the song "Click Clack". At the age of 14, he is the oldest person to win the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in its 7 year History. Luara Hayrapetyan achieved Armenia another second place. Ekaterina Ryabova also took second place for Russia.
Location.
The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) invited broadcasters to bid for the rights to host the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2009; three bids were received from Belarus, Serbia, and Ukraine. TV4 of Sweden had originally sent in a bid during summer 2007, but soon withdrew its bid after deciding to completely withdraw from the contest. After deliberations by the EBU, National Television Company of Ukraine was granted the rights to the 2009 contest and will host it in Kiev. Ukraine also hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 at the same venue.
On 12 November 2009 Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasiunyk declared that the contest would not be postponed; (earlier) Party of Regions member of parliament Hanna Herman had called on Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko to cancel the song contest because of the 2009 flu pandemic in Ukraine.
Both Prime Minister Tymoshenko and President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko were present during the final; Tymoshenko was also present and speeched during the opening ceremony on 16 November 2009.

...From the Hungry i

...from the Hungry i is The Kingston Trio's first live album, released in 1959 (see 1959 in music). It was recorded in 1958 at the San Francisco club hungry i shortly after the release of their debut album "The Kingston Trio". It was awarded an RIAA gold album on October 24, 1960 and presented to the group in 1961.
History.
What producer Voyle Gilmore heard when he first saw the Kingston Trio at The Purple Onion in 1958 convinced him to sign the group to Capitol Records. "...from the Hungry i" was released in order to expose the record buying public to what live audiences experienced at a Trio performance. This appeal was successfully conveyed with this live album, indicated by its number 2 chart position and receiving a gold album award. The Trio was a carefully rehearsed act, the jokes and introductions to songs planned, delivered and also graded by their manager Frank Werber. Gilmore recorded two nights of the group's twenty-seven day engagement at the club.
In 1964, the hungry i would also be the location for the recording of the final album for Capitol ("Back in Town") by the John Stewart Trio.
Reception.
The album was awarded an RIAA gold album on October 24, 1960.
In his Allmusic review, critic Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr. notes the intensity of the trio's performances and the audience reactions. Lankford writes their first live album "captures the band live, singing vibrant versions of "Tic, Tic" and "They Call the Wind Maria." Because of the acoustic arrangements and professionalism of the band, this live performance easily matches the quality of the group's studio work."
Track listing.
The original LP release had eleven songs.
