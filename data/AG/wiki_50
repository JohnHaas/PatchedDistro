Confession album

The confession album, or confession book, was a kind of autograph book popular in late nineteenth century Britain. Instead of leaving free room for invented or remembered poetry, it provided a formulaic catechism. The genre died out towards the end of the century, with occasional brief revivals in the twentieth century. The same kind of form is now found in the Dutch "vriendenboek" ("friends book") and German "Freundschaftsbuch" ("friendship book"), used by small children; and the questions that the confession album contained live on in the Proust Questionnaire often used for celebrity interviews.
Questions.
The questions posed in a confession album varied from volume to volume. A typical set of questions, in a book from the 1860s, is given below along with the answers of one respondent (see picture, right). The same set of questions were presented to Queen Victoria's second son, Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1873, to Marcel Proust around 1885 and to Claude Debussy in 1889.
Among the questions found in other albums, several seem designed to help courtship, sometimes with a reflection of changing relations between the sexes, for instance "What is your opinion of the girl of the period?", " What is your opinion of the man of the period?"
History.
Britain and America.
The origins of the confession album are unclear. Samantha Matthews notes the similarity to oracle games of the first half of the nineteenth century (she cites examples from 1810 to 1852). These interactive books, which bore titles such as "The Young Lady's Oracle: A Fireside Amusement", included questions that resemble those of the confession albums (for instance "Which is your favourite flower?", "Which is your favourite historical character?"), including sexually distinguished questions appropriate to courtship (for instance, "What is the character of your lady love?", "What is the character of him you love?"). 
Whatever their origins, confession albums were an established form by the 1860s: Henry d'Ideville records using an album in 1861 (see Germany and France below); Karl Marx filled out answers to one in the spring of 1865 (his favourite colour was red); and Friedrich Engels answered another in 1868 (his idea of happiness was Château Margaux 1848). Early albums often had blank pages into which owners would paste the questionnaires; the questions on these could be preprinted or handwritten. One such album with handwritten questions, was that of Karl Marx's daughter Jenny, which contains entries dated from 1865 to 1870. For some of these, she sent the questions to friends, asking them to fill them out and return them. Her comments in a letter of November 1865 suggest that she regarded the genre as a novelty:
I have a whole book filled up in that way and the answers are very amusing when compared with one another. These Confession books have put albums and stamp books quite into the shade. … I should much like to have answers. It is more interesting and amusing than a mere Autograph.
By the end of the decade, the printed and bound confession book had been introduced. The earliest currently known example with a printed publication date is "Mental Photographs", an album published in New York in 1869, which contained place for a photograph as well as the set of questions (a combination already found in Jenny Marx's album). The albums seem to have enjoyed their greatest popularity in the following decades, but to have become unfashionable by the early years of the twentieth century. At their height, confession albums were widespread enough that in 1883 Douglas Sladen could rely on readers' familiarity with the form to play on it with a poetical answer. He begins:
My favorite virtue, I confess, is chivalrous devotedness,
My favorite quality in man, the manful genius that can
With iron will and eye sublime, up to the heights of empire climb;
Although in woman, as I think, gentleness is perfection's pink
This ubiquity was accompanied by a certain exasperation. In a novel of 1886, a character asks: ""A propos" of the confessional, did any of you ever come under the torture of that modern Inquisition, the 'Confession Book?'" Early twentieth century writers look back on the books as a long unfashionable genre. A writer in 1915 records:
So far as I can recollect it was voted a bore at the end of the 'seventies and, except in suburban homes, such as my own, was never referred to except with a yawn or a smile after the early eighties.
The "Daily Chronicle" in 1906 remarks: "'If not yourself, who would you rather be?' was a favourite question of the confession album of the seventies." A. A. Milne (1882–1956) looked back in 1921 on the album as something from his childhood:
The confession-book, I suppose, has disappeared. It is twenty years since I have seen one. As a boy I told some inquisitive owner what was my favourite food (porridge, I fancy), my favourite hero in real life and in fiction, my favourite virtue in woman, and so forth.
Some album producers saw World War I as an opportunity to revive the confession book. The new albums, unlike their Victorian predecessors, ignored questions appropriate to courtship. They were clearly intended to be filled out by soldiers, a point spelt out in the title of one: "My Brave Friend's Confession Book" (1915).
Germany and France.
According to Henry d'Ideville, he had an "album-questionnaire" in which he collected the responses of friends and acquaintances in 1861, when as a diplomat in Naples he took the answers of Urbano Rattazzi and Mme de Solms, which he reproduces. His account, written in 1872, explains the nature of the album, as though he did not expect readers to be familiar with it:
Here is what the operation consists of: you pose a series of questions to the unfortunate subject of the interrogation and he has to answer them one after the other. – What poet, what painter, what occupation, what pleasure, what sensation, etc. etc. do you prefer? The answers are written down, then the person signs and dates his interrogation and that's the game over.
British confession albums also circulated on the continent (see Questions above), and (perhaps in imitation of them) there were also questionnaire books in other languages. In Germany there were several, notably "Erkenne Dich Selbst!" ("Know Yourself"), which first appeared in 1878 and survived to around 1900, going through at least 22 impressions, produced by Friedrich Kirchner (1848–1900). The "Leipziger Illustrirte Zeitung", which belonged to the same publishers as Kirchner's album, set his questions to celebrities, a forerunner of the modern use as the Proust Questionnaire; facsimiles of these answers were in turn printed in the album. In France, two are known, both containing the word "Confidences" in the title to represent the English "confessions". Here too the "Revue illustrée" set confession album questions to the famous, including Zola and Verlaine.
Revivals.
Friendship books.
In Holland, where autograph books are very popular among young schoolchildren, publishers have recently started bringing out an alternative in the so-called "vriendenboek" or "vriendjesboek" ("Friends book"), which much like the confession album come preprinted with a set of questions about the respondents' hobbies, idols and wishes. Some children prefer the new format, which says more about the person answering, but most prefer the traditional autograph book, which leaves more room for their own creativity. The modern German "Freundschaftsbuch" ("Friendship book") has the same kind of preprinted questions and is typically aimed at the same age group.
Proust Questionnaire.
In 1886, Marcel Proust, then a child of fourteen, filled out the answers to an English confession album, which bore the title "Confessions. An Album to Record Thoughts, Feelings, &c." (his answers were auctioned in 2003 for $34,000). Interest in Proust led to a later revival of the questions as a kind of formulaic interview for celebrities, first by Léonce Peillard in France in the 1950s, later in French and American television and in the magazine of the German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung", starting in 1980, and in "Vanity Fair" since 1993, under the name of "The Proust Questionnaire", which disguises its unintellectual British origins. This use too had been anticipated by nineteenth century journals (see Germany and France).

Educational Service Units of Nebraska

Educational Service Units (E.S.U.'s) are political subdivisions that serve as intermediate level education service agencies for member school districts. Educational Service Units were created by the Nebraska Legislature in 1965 as cooperative programs to make services more cost effective for school districts. There are currently 17 E.S.U.'s providing services to 261 public school districts. Educational service units provide core services for school districts, which include staff development, technology, and instructional materials. Beyond the core services, E.S.U.'s determine the services to be offered based on the needs of their member school districts.
Regional service agencies are present in over half of the states. The method of selecting the board varies, but most are either elected by the public or selected by local school boards. A more in depth analysis of the selection process is contained in the section on Governance.
In addition to regional service agencies, county or regional superintendents are publicly elected in parts of Arizona, California, Illinois, and Montana. In New Jersey, county superintendents are appointed by the chief state school officer, and in North Dakota by county commissioners. Nebraska allows for county school administrators to be appointed by county boards, but eliminated the elected office of county superintendent as of June 30, 2000.
Educational Service Units have been studied on several occasions. The most significant studies were in 1986 by the Legislature and in 1995 by the Department of Education. This review builds on the prior studies and examines the current status of E.S.U.'s, including changes implemented as a result of the preceding efforts.
The study was conducted by a staff group consisting of legislative staff from the Education Committee, staff from the offices of members of the Education Committee, and staff from the Legislative Fiscal Office. The staff group conducted the study using several methods. First historical research was done beginning with the prior studies and building on the information they provided. The Legislative Fiscal Office provided updated financial information. Internet resources were used to derive national information. The staff group then visited six E.S.U.'s, met with representatives from seven additional E.S.U.'s, and invited the other four E.S.U.'s to provide input. The staff group also gathered information through surveys sent to each E.S.U. and each school district. The surveys replicated the surveys from 1986 and 1995. However, the redundancy of the responses on the E.S.U. surveys in this study indicated efforts by a number of the E.S.U.' s to coordinate their answers. This effort compromised the quality of information by limiting the perspectives that were shared with the study group. The E.S.U. survey utilized open-ended questions, resulting in a narrative description, rather than a quantitative summary.
This report looks at four categories of issues: Boundaries, Governance, Finance, and Services. The report is organized according to those categories. Under each category is a background section, a section discussing potential issues, and a section indicating possible changes. The potential issues and possible changes do not necessarily reflect the views of the staff group that compiled this report or the views of the Education Committee, but rather represent concerns and ideas that have been brought forward over time or in the process of this study.
The statutory requirements governing E.S.U.'s are generally contained in the Educational Service Units Act. However as a political subdivision other provisions also apply, such as the Nebraska Budget Act, the Elections Act, and the Interlocal Cooperation Act.
The Department of Education has also issued two rules regarding E.S.U.'s. Rule 84 is the accreditation rule for E.S.U.'s. Rule 85 provides the procedures for E.S.U. reorganizations.
In the visits to E.S.U.'s and with E.S.U. staffs, there was generally an eagerness to show how much had been accomplished with limited funding. There was a definite emphasis on economic efficiency and the delivery of services. However, a major concern for most E.S.U.'s was inability to provide more services due to financial constraints.

Pro Roscio Amerino

The speech Pro Roscio Amerino was given by Marcus Tullius Cicero on behalf of Roscius of Ameria. Roscius was accused of murdering his father. The speech was given by Cicero in 80 BCE.
Events surrounding the case.
The events that made possible the accusation of the younger Roscius of Ameria began long before the murder of the elder Sextus Roscius of Ameria. Beginning in 97 BCE, Rome began to see the rise of Lucius Cornelius Sulla. A man known for his brutality and cunning, Sulla was feared by many around him. In "Sulla" the author Plutarch helps to shed light on Sulla’s character by chronicling the most powerful parts of the dictator's life. According to Plutarch, Sulla, a general of Rome, was characterized by “…a vehement and an implacable desire to conquer…” Following the Social War (91-88 BCE) he ascended to the position of consul of Rome in 88 BCE. During this time, the consul Sulla managed to lose his authority and to be exiled. However, this was merely a small interruption in his rise to power. Following the siege of Athens in 87 BCE, he again prepared to take control of Rome. And in 82 BCE he successfully became dictator. He immediately set out to ensure that his power would not slip from his grasp again. Beginning with a large-scale execution of his enemies, Sulla soon adopted a more systematic approach. With the adoption of the proscriptions Sulla made those who had displeased him “enemies of the state.” The consequences of being “proscribed” were a death sentence and the seizure of all property that had belonged to he who had been placed on the list. According to Plutarch, in order to expedite this process of asset liquidation, Sulla made it known that “…to him who should slay any one proscribed person, he ordained two talents reward, even were it slave who had killed his master, or a son his father.” Furthermore, Sulla made it known that the penalty for aiding any person who had been proscribed was proscription. It was in this way that Sulla dealt with all current and potential threats to his power. Neither senators nor merchants were immune. Following his year as dictator, Sulla chose to step down and to “return” the power to the Senate. He was again elected to the consulship of Rome and served his post throughout 80 BCE. As the consul, it can readily be deduced that nearly all still feared the power of Sulla and his keen eye for “threats.” Sulla died in 78 BCE.
It was in this context that the Pro Roscio Amerino case began. In 81 BCE, Sextus Roscius of Ameria, a wealthy landowner, was murdered while returning from a party in Rome. Immediately following, word of his death was sent by Roscius Magnus, who was in Rome, to Roscius Capito who was in Ameria, Both men were relations of Sextus Roscius, and according to E.H. Donkin, were rumored to have been on bad terms with the late Sextus Roscius because of a dispute over land. The two men, Magnus and Capito, then sent word of the murder to Cornelius Chrysogonus. Chrysogonus, a favorite of the dictator Sulla, also a freedman, which Cicero mentions as well, then entered into a plot with Magnus and Capito to have the elder Sextus Roscius of Ameria proscribed, and all of his assets taken by the state. Knowing full well that Sulla rewarded those who helped him to eliminate his enemies, the three conspirators expected to receive large amounts compensation in the form of the elder Sextus Roscius’ estate. As a result of their “loyalty” the men were able to purchase the estate for 2000 sesterces, which was well under the estimated value of the property. However, the eldest (and only living, as is mentioned in the text) son of Sextus Roscius, Roscius of Ameria, still had a rightful claim to his late father's property if he and the people of Ameria could somehow have the elder Sextus Roscius’ name removed from the proscription list. Sensing this threat, the three conspirators accused Roscius of Ameria of parricide and the murder of his own father in order to gain more property for himself in 80 BCE. A virtual unknown within the city of Rome, Roscius of Ameria had little clout. Furthermore, despite the noble contacts that his father had made, many feared to help him to clear his family’s name because their help may have been construed by Sulla (he was at this time consul of Rome and the court was under his jurisdiction) as a threat or insult. In short, most feared that by helping Roscius of Ameria, that they would themselves be proscribed, executed, and have their assets taken away from their families. This seems to be one of the reasons that his case was given over to the young Cicero.
Outcome and aftermath of the case.
Sextus Roscius of Ameria was acquitted. As his first major case, it was of great benefit to Cicero's reputation, especially given that he was opposing powerful political interests. Indeed, his success may well have incurred the wrath of Sulla, and perhaps influenced Cicero's decision to travel to Athens the following year. Cicero's oration in this case is notable for its intense and exhaustive style; something that he would learn to improve on as he matured and learnt new styles of oratory.
Content of the speech.
In the twenty sixth year of his life, Cicero chose to defend Sextus Roscius of Ameria. Sextus Roscius the Elder was a prosperous citizen of Ameria. When the elder Roscius was killed by “unknown men,” his son of the same name was charged. The case came before the court established by Sulla for poisoning and murder. In the two primary sections of his speech he attempts to dissuade the jury from the traditionally harsh Roman punishments for patricide. 
Cicero’s first section appeals that the charge is baseless and points out the lack of corroborated evidence. He argues that his client lacked the motive to kill his father. The argument over motive seems to be the primary deciding factor in this portion of the case. Cicero quickly shifts to the offensive in section two. Here he places the blame for the murder of the elder Roscius squarely on two other present individuals: Magnus and Capito. Cicero suggests that Magnus, having been home on the night of the murder, ordered the killing. He also implies that Capito, first to report the murder, had done the deed himself and then came to tell Magnus of his success. 
Cicero then goes off on a melodramatic tale of corruption and intrigue that claims both Magnus and Capito stood to gain property from the murder. He asserts that Magnus and Capito were using the trial to remove the possible succession of property from father to son, allowing them to take the property of elder Roscius for themselves. Possibly for the benefit of a mastermind figure: Chrysogonous; who had a somewhat obvious connection to the dictator Sulla.
Scholarly observations of the speech.
The dilemma.
“The Dilemma” of the speech as seen by W. B. Sedgwick is as follows: “If Roscius I (the father) was proscribed, Roscius II (the son) could not be prosecuted for his murder; if he was not proscribed, the property was illegally sold.” Sedgwick claimed in his 1934 article in The Classical Review that Cicero avoided addressing this dilemma because Chrysogonus had already removed Roscius I’s (the father’s) name from the proscription list. Sedgwick claims that when the delegation of men from Ameria came to Sulla’s camp, Chrysogonus had persuaded them to leave without seeing Sulla by promising to set everything right himself and by taking Roscius I’s name off the proscription lists as an act of good faith towards the delegation. This act on Chrysogonus’ part necessitated the charge brought against Roscius II in order to clear the former as well as the Roscii of all wrongdoing. Also, Sedgwick claims that with Roscius II removed, “no questions would be asked.” 
In an article written by T. E. Kinsey for Mnemosyne some thirty years later Sedgwick’s hypothesis is called into question. Kinsey distinguishes two different meanings for the word proscriptus, termed by Kinsey the “strict sense” and the “narrow sense.” The “strict sense” referred to those whose names had actually been written on the Lex de Proscriptione at the time of its original publication and proclamation. Regarding the “narrow sense” Kinsey proposes that after the publication of the original law of proscriptions, Sulla and his close supporters kept a running list of enemies both alive and dead who were not included in the original law. Kinsey believes that the delegation of men from Ameria that went to Sulla’s camp had no direct knowledge as to why Roscius I had been murdered and why his property had been seized. Kinsey states that the members of the delegation (except Capito) assumed that Roscius I had been proscriptus in the strict sense. When the delegation pressed Chrysogonus on this, the latter asserted that Roscius I had mistakenly been proscriptus in the “narrow sense.” Chrysogonus, having appeased the delegation for the meantime, then went after Roscius II in an effort to end all speculation in the matter. Kinsey then goes on to address why Cicero did not employee the second part of the dilemma in his defense. Throughout his speech, Cicero consistently states that Roscius II only wished to be acquitted and that he will not seek to recover his inheritance. Kinsey proposes that many people had profited from the proscriptions (perhaps even members of the jury) and that Roscius II was less likely to be “acquitted if it meant the beginning of a long period of reprisal and restitution.” Therefore, Chrysogonus along with anyone else who might have been nervous about Roscius II’s acquittal would be reassured.
Publication.
There is some debate about whether the speech that is extant is the original speech. There are two main schools of thought regarding this issue. The first believes that the extant speech varies considerably from the one given. This is due to the theory that the political climate at the time the speech was given, regarding Sulla and his regime, would not allow such criticism of Sulla as is seen in the extant speech. Therefore, these criticisms must have been added by Cicero at a later date, perhaps 77, after Sulla's death. This belief is countered by those who believe that the identified criticisms of Sulla "are, on the surface at least, complimentary" This theory posits that the extant speech was written immediately after Cicero gave the speech, exactly as given to allow for some instances of improvisation. This theory is further countered by debate over the supposed "complimentary" passages as being actually ironically critical. The first theory gains further weight from the fact that Cicero later references his defense of Roscius as evidence of resisting dictators. This would inicate that some revisions may have been made to improve his image.
Urban vs. rural stereotypes.
The allusion to the grace and virtue of a country life vs. the vice and corruption of an urban one are very common motifs in Cicero’s defense of Roscius. He begins by parading the virtues of the hard-working farmer who was the very foundation of the glorious city of Rome. Here he is appealing to the traditional historical account of the foundation of Rome. By tying his client in with the rural and his enemies with the urban he conveys to his audience a stereotype that leaves his enemies suspect for their greedy amoral city ways. The idea of the virtuous farmer and vice-ridden city dweller serves as a whole-sale substitute for fact in his case against Magnus, Capito and by extension Chrysogonus."
Where most of the Roman audience would have assumed that a father who did not like his son would give him over to a farm, which was viewed as slave work, as punishment, Cicero paints the virtues of the farm in such a light as to assume that the elder Roscius liked his son and thus endowed him with the wonderful responsibility that the farm represents: productive and self-sustaining. Cicero fails to produce much evidence, but denies the assumption that the father relegated his son to the farm because the younger Roscius had incurred too much debt.
Use of comic motifs in the speech.
At one point during the speech, Cicero turns Erucius’ argument for prosecution against him by utilizing a metaphor derived from the popular stage. Cicero refers to the comedic play “Hypobolimaeus” rewritten by the Roman playwright Caecilius Statius from the original written by Menander, both now lost. The play’s plot centers on a father with two sons, one of which remains of the farms in the countryside and the other stays with the father in the city. This situation matched Sextus Roscius’ family situation, before his father’s murder. The great advantage of using this play as a metaphor in Cicero’s speech is explained by Byron Harries in Acting the Part: techniques of the comedic stage in Cicero’s early speeches. In his paper, Harries goes into great detail on the implications of the metaphor and its intended reaction among the jury. Harries also focuses on the relationship between comedic motifs in Roman plays and the Roman family.
Gladiatorial metaphors in the speech.
August M. Imholtz, Jr. in his paper Gladiatorial Metaphors in Cicero’s "Pro Sex. Roscio Amerino" describes Cicero’s use of certain terms such as gladiator and gladiator instructor as metaphors for assassin, executor and butcher. Many of the Latin word’s etymologies came directly from Etruscan which Imholtz claims Cicero intentionally employed to heighten the dramatic effect of his speech. The intensity of Latin oration coupled with Cicero’s intensely illustrative language regarding his characterization of Magnus and Capito both greatly benefited Cicero’s defense.

Loudoun County Commuter Bus

The Loudoun County Commuter Bus, also known as Loudoun County Transit, is a public-transportation service provided by the Loudoun County, Virginia government. The buses operate from Dulles, Leesburg, and Purcellville to Washington Metro stations as well as directly to Rosslyn, Virginia, The Pentagon, and Washington, D.C.. The service is attractive because the buses, unlike normal traffic, are permitted to travel on the express lanes of the Dulles Toll Road. This allows for a shorter trip and also bypasses commuter tolls. The Loudoun County Commuter Bus accepts payment via SmarTrip, a reloadable transit card issued by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
Loudoun County Transit buses should not be confused with Virginia Regional Transit (VRT) buses, which also serve Loudoun County (among other Virginia counties) and have overlapping bus stops within the county. LC Transit uses long buses (seating around 50) with white and metal trim and display the LC Transit logo (shown above),
while VRT buses are short (seating around 15) and have a predominantly white and maroon color scheme, frequently without a logo.

Preqin

Preqin is a research and consultancy firm focusing on alternative asset classes. The company covers private equity, real estate, infrastructure, and hedge funds and is headquartered in London, UK, with additional offices in New York, USA; Singapore and San Francisco, California, USA. Preqin maintains a number of publications and online databases. It is a source of news and data for the alternative assets industry, and receives numerous mentions in press around the world on a daily basis.
Company history.
Preqin traces its roots back to 2002, when the company was launched with the name Private Equity Intelligence. It was founded by Nick Arnott and Mark O'Hare. Private equity represented the sole area of focus for the company at the time. The first product launched by the firm was Performance Analyst, which uses the Freedom of Information Act legislation in the UK and US to gain performance data on private equity fund performance from public pension plans. This made it possible to view fund performance data for thousands of private equity vehicles at the fund level. Other products providing a list of fund managers on the road seeking capital and a database of institutional investors active in private equity soon followed.
Preqin extended its scope to include real estate in 2006, to hedge fund investors in 2007, and to infrastructure in 2008. As a result of the change in focus from private equity to all alternative assets, the company changed its name to became formally known as Preqin in 2008.
Within its three main areas of focus—private equity, real estate, and infrastructure—Preqin publishes information on private equity funds including fund performance, fund terms and conditions, fund manager profiles and fund of funds as well fundraising and information on institutional investors. Preqin also publishes information on hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, and institutional investors.
Research.
Aside from its subscription services and publications, Preqin releases research on a number of different topics that are used throughout the alternative assets industry.
Quarterly fundraising.
Preqin releases quarterly fundraising data for the private equity industry, real estate industry, and infrastructure industry showing how much capital has been raised by how many funds. In addition it also releases information for fundraising on specific topics. Preqin's fundraising statistics account for funds on a global scale, and are widely used throughout the alternatives industry and in the financial press as a barometer for investor appetite. Preqin also releases figures for the number of funds currently on the road seeking capital at any time. These figures give an indication of how congested the private equity market is at any given time—whether there are enough funds on the road to satisfy investor demand, or too many funds causing increased competition.
Performance research.
Preqin uses its database of information related to performance on unlisted vehicles to release research on performance data, both generally and specifically on topics in the news. In November 2008, it released data showing the performance of fund interests sold by CalPERS in one of the largest secondaries sales in history. It regularly releases information relating to dry powder—the amount of capital that has been committed but remains uncalled to private equity funds. This is used as an indication for how much cash private equity firms have to deploy for new investments in companies.
Investor surveys.
Preqin carries out surveys to investors to establish trends in the industry.
Hedge fund investor research.
Preqin releases information quarterly, regarding investors in hedge funds.
Research availability.
Preqin releases its free research via its monthly newsletters. These are sent out on a monthly basis to subscribers via pdf. Current circulation of Spotlight newsletters and Preqin research is in excess of 45,000. Subscription is free on Preqin's website. Preqin also maintains a database of past papers, which is also available on its website.

Yefim Golyshev

Yefim Golyshev (, variously transliterated as "Golyscheff", "Golyschev", "Golishiff", "Golishev", etc.) (8 September 1897 – 25 September 1970) was a Ukrainian-born painter and composer who was mainly active in Europe. 
After a successful career as a child prodigy violinist and the Reger Prize from Berlin's Stern Conservatory, Golyshev became one of the founding members of the Dadaist November Group, painting "anti-art" works and creating music for kitchen utensils and various new, invented instruments. In 1933 he had to flee from the Nazis, first to Portugal, then to Barcelona, where he worked as a chemist until 1938. He spent World War II in France, either in prison or hiding. Between 1956 and 1966 Golyshev, lived in São Paulo, where he influenced Brazil's Música Nova composers. He died in Paris in 1970.
Golyshev the composer is notable for his only surviving composition, a string trio. This piece, subtitled "Zwölftondauer-Komplexe" (twelve-tone-duration complex), was published in 1925 in Berlin, but was possibly written as early as 1914. It makes use of various 12-note and 12-duration complexes, making it one of the earliest pieces of music composed using a variant of twelve-tone technique, and predating Olivier Messiaen's work. There are five movements, four provided with titles referencing their dynamics:
The dynamics in the last movement are left to the performers to decide on. Copies of the archival score can be ordered directly from Robert Lienau, the original publishers of the work.
The rest of Golyshev's compositional output, which included two operas, romances, music for Vsevolod Pudovkin's lost film "Igdenbu the Great Hunter", a string quartet and other pieces, is lost.

City House

City House is a building over Leeds railway station that was built as British Railways House in 1962. The buildings were, like many other railway buildings in the UK, designed by the subsequently disgraced architect John Poulson. Poulson also designed the Leeds International Swimming Pool. Upon its construction it was famously lambasted by the poet John Betjeman, who said that the building blocked all the light out of City Square and was only a testament to money, having no architectural merit. He made similar criticism in 1968. 
The building was bought by a property company, Kenmore, in 2006 with a view to regenerating what it described as a "tired and dilapidated" building. Kenmore received planning permission in 2008 to extend the building at the back (on the south side) and re-clad it in glazed curtain walling. The scheme was due to be completed in 2009. However Kenmore went into liquidation in 2009 before the scheme had started. A December 2011 photo shows little change from the 2008 image (right).
In 2010 the building was bought by office property company Bruntwood which plans to redevelop it. Planning permission for the refurbishment was granted by Leeds City Council on 13 October 2011. Bruntwood's brochure for the redevelopment claims that: 
Bruntwood will probably not start redevelopment of the building until it has a pre-let for some of the space and an agreement with Network Rail about improvements to the station's South Concourse, which is next to City House.

Elaeophora abramovi

Elaeophora abramovi is a nematode parasite found in the hepatic arteries of the Moose ("Alces alces") in Russia.
Discovery and nomenclature.
This species was first described in 1951 from adults found adhering to the inner wall of the hepatic arteries of a Russian Moose ("Alces alces"), and named "Alcefilaria abramovi". In 1974, it was transferred to the genus "Cordophilus", and in 1976 it was transferred to the genus "Elaeophora". Consequently, some of the older literature on this species uses the genus names "Alcefilaria" or "Cordophilus".
Hosts and geographic distribution.
"E. abramovi" has been found in the hepatic arteries of European elk ("Alces alces"), Reindeer ("Rangifer tarandus") and Red deer ("Cervus elaphus"), as discussed in. "E. abramovi" has only been found in Russia.

Dried nasal mucus

Dried nasal mucus, pieces of which are colloquially known as boogies or boogers or bogeys, is found in the nose and is a result of drying of the normally viscous colloidal mucus (commonly known as snot).
Formation.
The mucous membranes in the nasal cavity constantly produce a wet mucus that lines the cavity and removes dust and pathogens from the air flowing through. For the most part, the cilia that also line the cavity work to move the mucus down the nasal cavity to the pharynx where it can be swallowed. Not all of the mucus stays fluid enough to be moved by the cilia. The closer the mucus is to being in the nasal vestibule and near the nostril opening, the more moisture it loses to the outside air, and the more likely it is to dry out and become stuck.
Eating.
Stefan Gates in his book "Gastronaut" discusses eating dried nasal mucus, and says that 44% of people he questioned said they had eaten their own dried nasal mucus in adulthood and said they liked it. As mucus filters airborne contaminants, eating it could be thought to be unhealthy; Gates comments that "our body has been "built" to consume snot", because the nasal mucus is normally swallowed after being moved inside by the motion of the cilia. Friedrich Bischinger, a lung specialist at Privatklinik Hochrum in Innsbruck, says that nose-picking and eating could actually be beneficial for the immune system.

Elaeophora bohmi

Elaeophora bohmi is a nematode parasite found in various arteries of the horse. The adult males are 44-55 mm long and 95 µm wide, while adult females can be over 12 cm long and 210 µm wide. Microfilariae are not sheathed, and measure 300-330 µm long and 6-7 µm wide. The life cycle and clinical symptoms of infestation by "E. bohmi" have not been described.
Discovery and nomenclature.
"Elaeophora bohmi" was first described in 1953, from adults found in the arteries and veins in the extremities of Austrian horses. In 1976, some authors considered it to be a species of the genus "Onchocerca" -- "Onchocerca bohmi" (Supperer 1953) Bain et al., 1976 -- but most recent parasitology texts still refer to this species as "Elaeophora bohmi".
Hosts and geographic distribution.
So far, "E. bohmi" has only been found in horses ("Equus caballus") in Austria and Iran. Adults were found in the medial layer or outside layer of tissues within the artery wall.
Life cycle.
The life cycle of "E. bohmi" has not been studied.
Prevalence and clinical significance.
In the original species description, Supperer found "E. bohmi" in 6.7% of the Austrian horses examined. A survey of blood samples found "E. bohmi" microfilariae in 8.69% of Iranian horses examined, but none in donkeys or mules. Clinical symptoms of infestation have not been described.

"Elaeophora elaphi" was first described in 1986, from specimens found in the hepatic blood vessels of Red deer ("Cervus elaphus") from "Sierra Morena", Córdoba, Spain. The "note added in proof" in that study mentions that similar worms were also found in sheep. Both male and female adults, as well as microcercariae dissected from the uterus of females were described.
Hosts and geographic distribution.
So far, "E. elaphi" has only been described from Spain, in Red deer ("Cervus elaphus") and a sheep ("Ovis aries").
Description and life cycle.
The life cycle of "E. elaphi" has not been studied in detail. However, the seasonal cycle of adult "E. elaphi" abundance in its host "Cervus elaphus" is similar to the seasonal abundance cycle of "Elaeophora schneideri".
Clinical significance.
Adult "E. elaphi" have been found attached to the inner walls of the hepatic (liver) arteries and veins. Their presence affects the blood vessels in several ways, including inflammation of veins (phlebitis), blood clots (thrombosis), and thickening of artery walls. They also appear to induce a local humoral immune response in the host, including production of lymphoid tissue and granulomatous lesions. These lesions are sometimes found in the absence of the parasites, or in the presence of dead, calcified "E. elaphi".
Reported rates of infestation vary from 6 to 41% of sampled deer. The number of "E. elaphi" found per infested deer (intensity of infestation) ranges from 1 to 21, with averages of 8.5 and 9 in the two studies. Even though the deer in the study had the lesions mentioned above, none of them displayed any overt clinical symptoms. 
A red deer ("Cervus elaphus") transported from Germany to Spain was not so fortunate. Six months after transport, it was found staggering and feverish; and it died the next day. Necropsy revealed 100 "E. elaphi" in its hepatic (liver) blood vessels - a much higher infestation intensity than was found in local deer - in addition to "Theileria" infection. Because "E. elaphi" has never been found in Germany, the authors suggest that this deer may not have developed a sufficient immune background to deal with "E. elaphi" infestation once it was relocated to the "E. elaphi"-endemic area of Spain.

The City of Love

The City of Love (2007) is a novel by Rimi B. Chatterjee set in 16th century Asia against the background of the spice trade, piracy and the rise of various mystical religious cults. It traces the lives of four characters all of whom are in search of spiritual and material fulfilment embodied in the idea of the 'city of love'. The book was shortlisted for the Vodafone Crossword Book Award 2007.
Plot summary.
"The City of Love" begins with the siege of Malacca by the Portuguese in 1510. Fernando Almenara is a Castilian trader captured in the abortive first siege of Malacca. Fernando has a secret: he is fleeing the Inquisition in Florence for his involvement with a Cabalist group there, and the invasion of Florence by the Holy Alliance in 1509 meant death to him and his friends. During the siege he is kidnapped by Daud Suleiman ibn Shams al Basri, a sharp young Arab physician and pirate based in Chittagong. Fernando joins Daud’s ship, the Shaan-e-Dariya, crewed by fugitives and renegades from all over the known world, and comes to their home port.
Chandu Sadashiva is the son of a Shaiva priest exiled from Gaur, West Bengal to the wilds of rural Chittagong. His father Bhairavdas is determined to turn him into a powerful Tantric warrior against the foreign polluters of his land, but Chandu has other ideas. He forms a secret attachment with Bajja, a tribal girl eight years older than he is, who becomes his secret role model and ideal. Things fall apart when Bajja asks Chandu’s father to initiate her into the Tantra but he tries to seduce her and she escapes. Bitterly disappointed, she vows to find enlightenment or die by fasting at the cremation ground. Desperately ill from weeks of starvation, she is rescued by the wise woman Dhumavati who undertakes to train her.
At first Fernando’s band of pirates does well from their excellent piratical harbour, but then the Portuguese come to Chittagong and change the rules with their cannon and brutal ways. The pirate band breaks up, Fernando runs from agents of the Inquisition and falls in love with Bajja deep in the forest. Bajja is being taught the Sahajiya Buddhist Tantra by Dhumavati, while Fernando has training in the Christian Cabala, and together he and Bajja teach each other about love and the lore.
Meanwhile thirteen-year-old Chandu and his father have set out for Gaur to begin Chandu’s formal training, but they are ambushed on the way, Bhairavdas is killed and Chandu wounded in the throat and sold into slavery. Daud, who is travelling with a wandering Sufi, rescues and heals him. Chandu, temporarily speechless, is apprenticed to a blacksmith and takes the name Kalketu, having lost his Brahminical heritage. He becomes an accomplished Sufi qawwal or devotional singer.
Bajja is now wandering the countryside, teaching other Tantrics her wisdom in secret places, but she is becoming disillusioned with the way Dhumavati treats their followers. Finally Dhumavati persuades her to take part in a Tantric ritual which involves killing a child, and in disgust she gives up the life of a guru and disappears to seek her own truth. Fernando is crushed, and he returns to Chittagong where he agrees to return to Amsterdam with an old shipmate and join the Family of Love.
In the background of Sher Shah Suri’s and Humayun’s invasions of Bengal (1538–1540), Chandu sets off to look for Bajja and finds her herding pigs on top of a desolate mountain in Assam. They speak of all that has befallen them, lie down and make love.
The first part of the book is set against the spice trade from Antwerp to Indonesia, the greatest network of goods and ideas the world has ever known, and the struggle for supremacy in Chittagong between Bengal, Tripura and Arakan, and the Portuguese empire. In this cultural cauldron, established Hindu and Buddhist Tantric, Vaishnav and tribal traditions meet the three-centuries-old incursion of Islam and the dawning of contact with the West.
Excerpt.
Daud had closed his eyes and sat with his hands folded in his lap, one hand sometimes softly tapping the other. Fernando closed his eyes too. At first he felt nothing, then subtly the music changed. Without the light and glitter to distract him, it seemed to reach inside the darkness behind his eyes and gently cut him loose from himself. Pir Baba’s voice wove like a hummingbird around a note, climbed, danced with another. He seemed to sing alone, though the others followed his lead and he courteously let them repeat what he sang. He led them to places of melody they could never have reached on their own, and yet he was always a step ahead of them, teaching, teasing. His voice sounded as though many years of waiting for an answer from God had put pain into it along with joy, as though it had become a direct channel for a longing that could never be assuaged. It was a strong voice because it had known weakness, and it took Fernando in the cup of its hands and bore him aloft into the sky.

Naval Surface Warfare Center Port Hueneme

Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division (NSWC PHD), a component of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), is a tenant command located at Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, California. In addition to its primary location at Port Hueneme, the division operates detachments at White Sands, New Mexico, N.M., Virginia Beach, Va. and Louisville, Ky. 
History.
NSWC PHD was founded in 1963 as the Naval Ship Missile Systems Engineering Station. It was established to provide overall technical support for the new guided missiles—RIM-2 Terrier, RIM-8 Talos and RIM-24 Tartar—that were being introduced into the naval fleet. Port Hueneme was chosen as the site for this operation because of its deep water port, its proximity to the Navy’s missile testing range at Point Mugu, California and the availability of space at the already operating Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme.
Chartered as an In-Service Engineering Agent, the newly established organization emphasized onboard assistance to ship crews, analyzed problems and requirements and developed engineering and logistics improvements to the guided missile systems. The command’s engineering responsibilities soon expanded beyond missiles, assuming engineering work for many new weapon and combat systems used by the Navy’s surface fleet. The workforce also took on the responsibility of providing logistics support—referring to the procurement, maintenance and transportation of what the fleet needed—including maintenance and repair, training manuals, essential spare parts, tools and test equipment. The command also adopted the program of underway replenishment, which allows ships to receive fuel, ammunition and supplies while at sea.
Today, the command supports new technologies and innovations to sustain a wide variety of weapon, combat and warfare systems. NSWC PHD is focusing its technical capabilities on Next Generation in-service engineering, which involves direct connectivity to the fleet on a global basis and the immediate availability of round-the-clock access to products, services and fleet support capabilities.
Services.
NSWC PHD's Technical Capabilities include in-service engineering, test and evaluation and integrated logistics support for the following:
-Strike Force Interoperability and Theater Warfare Systems
-Surface Combat Systems
-Surface Warfare Systems
-Underway Replenishment Systems (including research & development)
-Surface Gun Systems
-Surface Missile Systems
-Surface Missile Launcher Systems
-Radar Systems
-Directed Energy Systems

Mount Shahdagh

Mount Shahdagh () is a mountain peak of the Greater Caucasus range, located in Qusar rayon of Azerbaijan, close to the border with Russia. The elevation of the peak is 4,243 metres above the sea level. Prehistoric cave dwellings have been discovered at the base of the mountain indicating habitation for over 9,000 years. Among the earth rocks found in Shahdag are magnesian lime, chalkstone and marble.
In February 2007, an Azerbaijani team of eight climbers ascended Shahdag, but could not reach the unconquered peak, which is still one of the last remaining unclimbed summits of Azerbaijan, because the tall cliffs surrounding it on all sides and strong winds make it extremely difficult and dangerous. 
The ascent was done under extreme conditions of an unusual route through frozen waterfalls, that are frozen at the foot of the mountain, attended by eight of the most experienced climbers of the country. Such an ascent is possible on Shahdag only during the winter season, when the hundred-meter waterfalls flowing down the slopes of the mountain, turn into giant ice blocks. 
Since the mountain is entirely bordered on all sides by tall cliffs, the only approach of climbing the mountain is only with climbing gear through the above mentioned technical rock and waterfall climbing routes.
Winter temperatures at Shahdag average -20°C.

Palatine P 3.1

The German steam locomotives of Palatine Class P 3.1 were operated by the Palatinate Railway and were the first engines in Germany with a 4-4-2 ("Atlantic") wheel arrangement. The two-cylinder saturated steam locomotives with inside cylinders had in addition to an inside bar frame a characteristic outer frame for the rear part of the locomotive, that partly covered the driving wheels. The valve gear was of the Joy type.
In 1898 and 1899 Krauss initially built eleven locomotives; in 1904 a twelfth followed that was equipped with a "Pielock" superheater. Although the P 3s met their intended performance criteria, they were soon overtaxed by increasingly long trains.
The Palatinate Railway decided therefore on an unusual conversion: in 1913 the two-cylinder engine was converted into a four-cylinder compound engine by the addition of two outside cylinders, the inner ones becoming the high-pressure cylinders. However they did not achieve the higher performance required, just a lower fuel consumption of around 15%.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over five of these locomotives as DRG Class 14.1 with numbers 14 101 to 14 105, but by 1926 they were retired from service. Also grouped into Class 14.1 were the Bavarian S 2/5s.
The locomotives were equipped with tenders of the Bavarian Class 3 T 16.

<doc id="20328867" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20328867" title="Elaeophora poeli">
Elaeophora poeli

Elaeophora poeli is a parasitic nematode found in the aorta, and sometimes the heart, of various cattle throughout Asia, and in parts of Africa. It is a large nematode, with males measuring 45–70 mm long and 200-260 µm wide, and females 40–300 mm long and 350 µm wide. Microfilariae are 340-346 µm long and 7.0-7.5 µm wide. Despite the fact that it lives in nodules (aneurysms) in the walls of the aorta and heart, apparent clinical symptoms of "E. poeli" infestation are seldom reported.
Discovery and nomenclature.
This species was first described from Water buffalo in 1879, and named "Filaria poeli". In 1912, it was transferred to the newly erected genus "Elaeophora" Railliet and Henry 1912. In 1938, a detailed redescription of "E. poeli" was published. In that study, "E. poeli" was determined to be the same animal that previous authors had referred to as "Filaria blini" and "Filaria haemophila", both isolated from Water buffalo aortas.
Hosts and geographic distribution.
"E. poeli" has been found in several species of cattle: African buffalo ("Syncerus caffer"), Carabao or Water buffalo ("Bubalus bubalus"), and Zebu ("Bos primigenius indicus"). The geographic distribution of this species includes several Asian and African nations: Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mozambique, the Philippines, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, and Vietnam.
Life cycle.
The life cycle of "E. poeli" is not known. The adults usually live attached to the inner walls of the aorta. They make aneurysmal (i.e. bulging) nodules in the wall of the aorta, which can be up to 2 cm in diameter. The male lives curled up inside the nodule, while the female lives with its head in the nodule and its body free in the lumen (interior space) of the aorta. Presumably the female sheds the offspring (microfilariae) directly into the host's bloodstream. Adults have also been found in nodules on the epicardium of the heart.
Prevalence.
The percentage of animals found to be infested in large-scale slaughterhouse studies range from 1.7% in Tanzanian Zebu ("Bos primigenius indicus") to over 60% in Philippine "Bubalus bubalis". A study of free-ranging buffalo in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, yielded a 55% infestation rate.
Clinical significance.
The nodules where the filariae reside (as described above) are aneurysms - bulges in the aorta wall - which could conceivably rupture. Corrugated and migratory tract lesions on the inner wall of the aorta and fibrin strands attached to the nodules have also been described. The latter study found narrowing of the aorta down to 1/3 of its usual diameter in some cases.
Despite the presence of nodules 2-cm in diameter on aorta walls and heart tissue, and narrowing of the aorta, almost all studies of "E. poeli" infestation mention a lack of obvious clinical symptoms in infested individuals. One study found a strong correlation between infestation and visceral pleuresy (inflammation of the membrane that surrounds the lungs).

He was a disciple of St Columba of Iona and of St Fintan, abbot of Clonenagh, and in the "Martyrology of Tallaght" he appears as Colman mac h Laighsi, with a feast day on 15 May. After several years as a novice at Iona, Colman returned to Ireland and chose Oughaval as the site of a new monastic settlement. Exactly when this was founded is unknown, but it was a little before the repose of St Fintan in about 595. The foundation had ceased to function long before the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII.
The Book of Leinster was kept at Oughaval for many generations and was then known as "Lebor na Nuachongbála", or the Book of Oughaval.
In the early 18th century a 12th-century stone roofed church survived, and the Cosbys of Stradbally Hall added a mortuary-chancel to it. The site of the monastery can still be identified, and a burial ground there is still in use. However, there are now no remains of the original church or monastic building, as the stone from them was robbed out in the 18th century to build a mausoleum. 
In about 1994, the Russian Orthodox Church built a new church nearby, in the demesne of Stradbally Hall, dedicated to St Colman of Oughaval.
Oughaval Wood.
Oughaval Wood, about 1.5 kilometres out of Stradbally on the Carlow road, is a mixed woodland of some one hundred and fifty hectares of broadleaved trees, with more than twenty kilometres of paths to walk. About half of the trees are beech planted in 1938-1941, and other species include ash, oak and Scots pine. There is a car park and picnic site. 
The wood's flora include bluebells and primroses, and its fauna badgers, foxes, rabbits, squirrels, and all kinds of native birds, including game.
Deep in the wood is the Mass Rock, where in the penal years between 1691 and 1727 local people gathered for Mass, and there is also a folly in the wood called Cobbler's Castle.
Township history.
Griffith's valuation, which was completed in 1864, shows twenty-two tenements in Oughaval, one of them in the occupation of the Rev. Cornelius Dowlin. The other names which appear in the valuation for the township were Byrne, Cosby, Dowling, Empey, Finch, Greene, Hodgens, Keeffe, Large, Manser, Murray, Power, Shortall, Smyth, Tarleton, Walsh, and Whelan.

ISRO Orbital Vehicle

The Indian manned spacecraft temporarily named Orbital Vehicle is intended to be the basis of the indigenous Indian human spaceflight program. The capsule will be designed to carry three people, and a planned upgraded version will be equipped with rendezvous and docking capability. In its maiden manned mission, ISRO's largely autonomous 3-ton capsule will orbit the Earth at 248 miles (400 km) altitude for up to seven days with a two-person crew on board. The crew vehicle is planned to be launch on ISRO's Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III, which is currently under development, in April 2014. As of February 2014, the HAL-manufactured crew module structural assembly was transferred to ISRO.
History.
The development of the Orbital Vehicle began in 2006. The plan was to design a simple vessel similar to the Mercury-class spacecraft with an endurance of about a week in space. It was designed to carry two astronauts and to land in water upon re-entry. The design was finalized by March 2008, and was submitted to the Government of India for funding. The funding for the Indian Human Spaceflight program was sanctioned in February 2009. Initially, the first unmanned flight of the Orbital Vehicle was expected to be in 2013.
ISRO based the Orbital Vehicle on the design of the SRE. ISRO had launched and recovered the 550-kg Space Recovery Capsule in January 2007. The full-scale manned OV spaceship was said to be derived from this, although ISRO's published concept showed a more elongated conical shape than the SRE.
Description.
The OV is a fully autonomous three-ton capsuled spacecraft designed to carry a 3 member crew to orbit and safely return to the Earth after a mission duration of few orbits to two days.
The space capsule will have life control and environment control systems. It will be equipped with emergency mission abort and emergency escape that can be done at the first stage and second stage of the rocket. The illustration of the spacecraft showed a main engine and smaller orientation engines arranged in a light package around the base of the capsule, indicating an earth-orbit maneuvering capability was to be included. The nose of the original version of the OV was free for a docking mechanism, but primary entry was evidently through a side hatch secured by explosive bolts.
The Orbital Vehicle is slated to be launched on the GSLV Mk II launcher.
About 16 minutes after liftoff from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota, the rocket will inject the OV into an orbit 300–400 km from the Earth. The capsule would return for a splashdown in the Bay of Bengal.
The Indian OV spacecraft will be significantly smaller than current Russian Soyuz, Chinese Shenzhou, planned US Orion or past Apollo spaceships but larger than the past US Gemini spacecraft.
While many technological elements to put together a manned flight are already available, ISRO would need to develop many new and novel technologies to ensure a foolproof life-support system, safety, reliability and an escape system for the crew. And in order to perfect the reentry techniques considered crucial for a manned flight, ISRO is planning to carry out three more flights of Space Recovery Capsules (SRE) and few unmanned flights of the OV spaceship.
Funding and Infrastructure.
Development of a fully autonomous orbital vehicle to carry a two-member crew into a low Earth orbit has begun. ISRO sources said the flight is likely to be in 2016. The government has allocated 50 crore (US$10 million) for pre-project initiatives for 2007 through 2008. A manned mission into space would require about 12,400 crore (US$3 billion) and a period of seven years. The Planning Commission estimates that a budget of 5000 crore (US$1 billion) is required for initial work of the manned mission during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007–12). The project report prepared by ISRO has been cleared by the space commission. In February, 2009 the Government of India has given the green signal for the Manned Space flight Program due to launch in 2016.
MC Dathan, director of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), stated that ISRO will set up a full-fledged training facility in Bangalore for training astronauts. ISRO is also planning to build a third launch pad at Sriharkota for manned missions with extra facilities like entry into the crew capsule and an escape chute.
In spring 2009 the full-scale mock-up of crew capsule of OV was built and delivered to Satish Dhawan Space Centre for training of astronauts.
Schedule.
In January 2010, it was announced that the ISRO OV would be launched with astronauts into space around 2016. However, in April 2012 it was reported that funding problems placed the future of the project in serious doubt; and in August 2013, it was announced that all manned spaceflight efforts by India had been designated as being 'off ISRO's priority list'.
However, by early 2014 the project had been reconsidered, and was one of the main beneficiaries of a substantial budget increase announced in February. Just prior to this, in January 2014, the ISRO Chairman revealed that the OV would be tested in flight in 2014. Like the SRE-1 mission, the vehicle would also splashdown in the Bay of Bengal.
On 13 February 2014, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited handed over the first Crew Module structural assembly to ISRO. ISRO's VSSC would equip the Crew Module with systems necessary for crew support, navigation, guidance and control systems. ISRO plans to undertake an unmanned test launch of the vehicle aboard the GSLV Mk3 X1 experimental sub-orbital flight in April 2014. This launch will test orbital injection, separation and re-entry procedures and systems of the Crew Capsule. This is most likely to include capsule separation, heat shields and aero-braking systems, deployment of parachute, retro-firing, splashdown, flotation systems and procedures to recover the Crew Capsule from the Bay of Bengal.

2009 CFU Club Championship

The 2009 CFU Club Championship was the 11th edition of the CFU Club Championship, the annual international club football competition in the Caribbean region, held amongst clubs whose football associations are affiliated with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU). The top three teams in the tournament – W Connection, Puerto Rico Islanders, and San Juan Jabloteh – qualified for the 2009–10 CONCACAF Champions League.
Qualified clubs.
The following clubs are all entered into the competition.
Competition format.
There was no tournament in 2008 because, prior to this edition, the CFU Club Championship had been held near the end of the calendar year, but in 2008 it was decided that it would be held near the beginning of the following calendar year in order to have the competition take place closer to the next CONCACAF Champions League, which uses this tournament as the Caribbean zone qualifying tournament. As a result, this, the next tournament, was held in early 2009.
The draw for the first round was held at the CONCACAF office in New York City on January 15. The first round matches were originally scheduled to be held over two legs on March 18 and 25. The draw for round two was completed immediately following the first round draw. The second round will also be two-legged and will be held in mid-April. The semi-finals, final and third-place match will be single-elimination matches hosted in Trinidad and Tobago. The semi-finals will be played on May 15, and the final and third-place match will be played two days later at the same venue.
Draw.
The first round was played among clubs from two pots. Each club was drawn against another club from the opposing pot.
1st Round.
The first round was contested in five two-legged matchups. Team #1 in each matchup hosted the first leg. The schedule for the first round legs was updated on March 11 due to necessary travel accommodations for clubs and local events occurring in Aruba and Haiti that would conflict with the original match schedule.
Second leg.
"W Connection won 17–1 on aggregate."
"Inter Moengotapoe won 3–2 on aggregate."
"Hoppers won 5–3 on aggregate."
"Cavaly won 6–0 on aggregate."
"Tempête won 3–1 on aggregate."
2nd Round.
San Juan Jabloteh were seeded and received a bye to the 2nd round. San Juan Jabloteh and W Connection both hosted their first leg matchups on the same day and decided to host their matches as a billed doubleheader at Manny Ramjohn Stadium in Marabella. In Jabloteh's return leg to Suriname they were without head coach Terry Fenwick, who did not travel with the team because he had not been paid by the club since the end of the 2008 TT Pro League season.
Second leg.
"San Juan Jabloteh won 5–2 on aggregate."
"W Connection won 4–1 on aggregate."
"Tempête won 8–0 on aggregate."
Final round.
All of the matches in the final round will be played at Marvin Lee Stadium in Macoya, Trinidad and Tobago. The final round matchups are single elimination; the losers will play one another in a third place matchup to determine the third and final CFU entrant into the CONCACAF Champions League 2009–10. The Puerto Rico Islanders were seeded and received a bye directly into the final round.

<doc id="20329026" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20329026" title="Elaeophora sagitta">
Elaeophora sagitta

Elaeophora sagitta is a parasitic nematode found in the heart, coronary arteries and pulmonary arteries of several ruminant species and African buffaloes in Africa. Infestation usually occurs without significant health effects in the Greater kudu ("Tragelaphus strepsiceros"), but may affect cardiac function in some other host species.
Discovery and nomenclature.
This species was first described in 1907 from the heart of a Bushbuck ("Tragelaphus scriptus") from Cameroon, and named "Filaria sagitta". In 1926, it was transferred to the genus "Cordophilus", as "Cordophilus sagittus." In 1976, the genus "Cordophilus" was made a synonym of the genus "Elaeophora", so this species became "Elaeophora sagitta".
Hosts and geographic distribution.
Adults of "E. sagitta" have been found attached to the inner walls of the chambers and vessels of the heart, as well as the arterioles of the lungs of various hosts: Bushbuck ("Tragelaphus scriptus"), Greater kudu ("Tragelaphus strepsiceros"), bongos ("Tragelaphus eurycerus"), nyala ("Tragelaphus angasii"), common eland ("Taurotragus oryx"), and African Forest Buffalo ("Syncerus caffer nanus"). This species has also been found in unspecified "cattle". Lesions similar to those described in "E. sagitta" infestations were also found in sheep ("Ovis aries"), but the actual parasites were not recovered. "E. sagitta" has been found in several African nations: Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi, Mocambique, the Republic of the Congo, South Africa and Swaziland.
Life cycle.
The life cycle of "E. sagitta" has not been studied in detail. It is viviparous, since the female sheds microfilariae, rather than eggs, directly into the blood stream.
Prevalence.
Infestation rates as high as 74% and over 90% have been reported in free-ranging kudu. Infestation in a herd of eland ("Taurotragus oryx") in Kruger National Park was reported as "nearly half of 33" individuals. A slaughterhouse survey in Swaziland yielded a very low prevalence–77 of 18,458 (0.416%) -- of bovine hearts showing lesions typical of "E. sagitta" infestation. In other host species, only isolated cases have been reported.
Clinical significance.
"E. sagitta" adults are typically found in the heart ventricles, as well as coronary and pulmonary arteries, and occasionally coronary veins. They produce aneurysmal (bulging) lesions in the vessel walls which are 1–2 cm in diameter, and have been associated with hypertrophy and dilatation of heart ventricles, thrombosis (blood clots) and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle). The degree of interference with general circulatory function has not been studied in detail. As one author points out, however, if the infested host is fleeing from a lion, only a minor difference in cardiopulmonary efficiency could certainly affect survival.
"E. sagitta" infestation appears to be clinically benign in greater kudu. Some fatalities in a herd of eland were attributed to "E. sagitta" infestation, though many of the eland were also "heavily" infested with various gastrointestinal parasites. In the Congo, "E. sagitta" infestation was suggested to be one of the factors which led to mortality in several bongos ("Tragelaphus eurycerus") and one African Forest Buffalo ("Syncerus caffer nanus")

Malta–Turkey relations

Maltese–Turkish relations are foreign relations between Malta and Turkey.
Historical background.
Malta has a historical significance for the Turkish people as the place where Turgut Reis, a famous admiral of the Ottoman Navy, was killed during the Siege of Malta in 1565. There is a Turkish Military Cemetery at Marsa, where during the last skirmish of the 1565 siege, the Ottoman Army lost many soldiers.
Political relations.
Malta is represented in Turkey through accreditation a Maltese Ambassador resident in Valletta to Turkey and its consulate–general in Istanbul. Turkey is represented in Malta through its embassy in Valleta. Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization and the Union for the Mediterranean. Also Malta is a European Union member since May 1, 2004 and Turkey is a candidate. These recent developments have helped to formalise diplomatic relations between the two countries. 
An "Agreement of Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investments and a Memorandum of Understanding on the Establishment of the Political Consultative Mechanism" between the two countries was signed in October 2003 in Antalya.
Economic relations.
The trade volume between Malta and Turkey reached $ 1.124 billion in 2008. This figure shows an increase of a 35% when compared with the preceding year.
The Turkish–Maltese Business Council, and organisations with similar aims, give priority to promoting commercial linkages. This Council was established on September 7, 2007.
As of 2008, 24 Turkish firms are operating in Malta, and the total capital of these firms are $ 1,3 billion.
The maritime sector is one of the co-operation areas between the two countries. Because Malta has one of the major ship repair facilities in the Mediterranean, and Turkey is emerging as an important shipbuilding and fleet owning country.
Air Malta and Turkish Airlines signed a codeshare agreement in 2008.
An Agreement of Co-operation in Tourism between the two countries was signed on September 19, 1997. 
In 2008, more than 3,058 Maltese tourists visited Turkey.

<doc id="20329093" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20329093" title="New York State Banking Department">
New York State Banking Department

The New York State Banking Department was created by the New York Legislature on April 15, 1851, with a chief officer to be known as the Superintendent. The New York State Banking Department was the oldest bank regulatory agency in the United States. 
The Department was the primary regulator for state-licensed and state-chartered financial entities, including domestic banks, foreign agencies, branches and representative offices, savings institutions and trust companies, credit unions and other financial institutions operating in New York including mortgage bankers and brokers, check cashers, money transmitters, and licensed lenders, among others. Total assets of the institutions regulated were nearly $2.2 trillion.
Effective October 3, 2011, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and the New York State Legislature consolidated the New York State Banking Department and the New York State Insurance Department and created the New York State Department of Financial Services.
Mission.
The Department's legislative mandate was to insure the safe and sound conduct of these businesses, to conserve assets, to prevent unsound and destructive competition, to maintain public confidence in the banking system, and to protect the public interest and the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders.
The New York State Banking Department was headquartered at One State Street in New York City and had an office in the state capital at the Empire State Plaza, Albany, and an office in Syracuse, New York to serve the most Northern and Western parts of the State.
Revenues to fund the Department's operating budget were derived from fees paid to it by state-chartered institutions. The Department was included in the New York State Executive Budget, and all expenses were paid by the New York State Comptroller out of State funds, reimbursed by the amounts assessed against the institutions subject to supervision. Expenses of examination and operation were paid entirely by the institutions subject to regulation.
Employees.
The Banking Department was headed by a Superintendent appointed by the Governor of New York. Almost 73 percent of the agency's nearly 600 full-time employees were bank examiners.
The Banking Board.
The Banking Board was established in 1932 by N.Y.S. Banking Law § 13 and 14, and was a quasi-legislative body. The Banking Board was created to advise and cooperate with the Banking Department in the formulation of banking standards and regulations and to exercise power to approve or disapprove the issuance of bank charters and licenses and the establishment of branch banks. The Board's powers were broad and affected many aspects of banking supervision.
In 2011, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and the New York State Legislature abolished the Banking Board as part of the consolidation of the Banking Department and New York State Insurance Department and the creation of the New York State Department of Financial Services. 
Banking Board membership.
The Board had seventeen members. The Superintendent of Banks was the Board's chairperson and executive head. Each of the other 16 members were appointed by the governor and approved by the senate for a three-year term. Eight were public members, while the other eight had to have banking experience and had to represent various segments of the banking community.
Members with banking experience were selected, one from each of the following eight groups:
Group one: banks, trust companies and private bankers located in the city of New York and having total assets of one billion dollars or more, as shown in their last report to the Superintendent.
Group two: banks, trust companies and private bankers located outside the city of New York and having total assets of one hundred fifty million dollars or more, as shown in their last report to the Superintendent.
Group three: banks, trust companies and private bankers other than those in group one and group two. 
Group four: savings banks located in the city of New York and the counties of Westchester, Rockland, Nassau and Suffolk. 
Group five: savings banks other than those in group four.
Group six: savings and loan associations.
Group seven: credit unions.
Group eight: foreign banking corporations licensed to maintain a branch or agency in the state. The member from this group must be a resident of the state but need not be a citizen of the United States.
Unique undertakings of the Banking Department.
Banking Development District (BDD) Program:
Section 96-d of the Banking Law, entitled 'Banking Development Districts' addresses a program created to encourage the establishment of bank branches in areas with a demonstrated need for banking services, with the goals of stimulating local economies and helping more New Yorkers enter the financial mainstream.
Banks partner with local governments to establish a BDD in an under-banked neighborhood, and, when approved by the Banking Department, are eligible to receive municipal deposits at below-market interest rates from the State.
The Enriched BDD program was launched in early 2005 to better coordinate the Banking Department and Comptroller’s Office with other community development and capacity-building initiatives. The Enriched BDD program also targets underbanked New York City neighborhoods and invites banks to apply for BDD branches in the pre-designated areas.
Holocaust Claims Processing Office
Created in 1997, the HCPO helps claimants from around the world obtain just resolution for the theft of property during the Holocaust-- specifically, assets deposited in European banks, monies never paid in connection with insurance policies issued by European insurers, and lost or looted art. HCPO is co-financed by the NYS Insurance Department, and has responded to over 10,600 inquiries, resulting in 4,746 claims from 44 states and 42 countries. 
Criminal Investigations Bureau
The Department's Criminal Investigations Bureau (CIB) provides specialized investigatory capabilities with respect to allegations of criminal activity involving the financial industry and works cooperatively with law enforcement organizations at the local, state and federal levels. CIB also houses a team of examiners who specialize in compliance with anti-money-laundering laws, such as the bank Secrecy Act. This unit identifies and mitigates threats to the financial industry stemming from money laundering and terrorist financing.
Mortgage Fraud Unit
The Criminal Investigations Bureau has a Mortgage Fraud Unit. They conduct coordinated reviews with the Department of State, a HALT member agency that oversees real estate appraisers. The Department compiles data on New York mortgages and iensures that homeowners facing foreclosure receive information about available counseling services. The Department conducted several foreclosure forums in 2008. The Banking Department provided $2 million in grants for foreclosure prevention, with money provided from settlements received from prior predatory lending enforcement actions.
New York participates in the National Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS), a state-run project that registers lenders. The department estimated that 20,000 lenders would be registered by January 2010.
Other activities.
ATM inspections
The Banking Department is responsible for inspecting ATM facilities for compliance with the requirements of the ATM Safety Act. This includes requirements for surveillance cameras, adequate lighting, key-card access and an unobstructed view of the facility from the street. This law applies not only to state chartered entities, but to all federally chartered banks, trust companies, savings banks, savings and loan associations or credit unions, as long as they operate one or more ATMs in New York, whether the entity is headquartered in New York or not. The Banking Department has 13 ATM safety inspectors.
Name approvals
Under Section 301 of the Business Corporation Law and analogous sections of the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law, the Limited Liability Company Law and Limited Partnership Act, the Banking Department and the Insurance Department (as appropriate) must approve the use of certain words (or abbreviations or derivatives thereof) in the name of an entity. The Banking Department approves the terms acceptance, bank, finance, investment, loan, mortgage, savings and trust. During the first 7 ½ months of 2007, the Department ruled on over 600 such applications.
Consumer services
The mission of the Banking Department's Consumer Services Division is to ensure that regulated institutions abide by the consumer protection, fair lending and community reinvestment requirements of the Banking Law and regulations. The division also strives to increase consumer access to traditional banking services in under-served communities by administering the Department's Banking Development District program and other community development initiatives. Finally, the Consumer Services Division runs a consumer help unit to resolve problems between consumers and regulated entities.
Consumer Help Unit
CHU was created in May 2005 in order to give New York consumers a single point of contact for learning about important banking-related issues, making inquiries and filing complaints. Its management falls to the Deputy Superintendent of CMR.
Nature of state regulation.
Regulation by the Banking Department begins with chartering, in the case of banks, trust companies and thrifts, licensing in the case of most other entities, and registration in the case of mortgage brokers.
For all entities, it involves an evaluation of the character and fitness of incorporators (for chartered entities), directors and officers. For banking entities, it also involves requirements as to corporate governance and limitations on corporate powers.
For most entities, it also involves financial requirements, such as a requirement as to minimum net capital. Banking organizations are also subject to restrictions on payment of dividends as well as restrictions on transactions with affiliates and loans to any one borrower. For all entities, it involves the requirement to maintain accurate books and records of its financial condition and transactions, as well as regular examination by the Department’s examination staff, which ranges from continuous on-site examination for the largest entities, to discrete examinations at appropriate intervals.
Under the Banking Law, the Superintendent may require a regulated entity to appear and explain any apparent violation of law, issue an order directing a regulated entity to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices or to make good an impairment of capital or, in the case of a banking organization, required reserves, or to improve its recordkeeping.
The Superintendent may take possession of and liquidate a banking organization and may suspend or revoke a certificate or license to do business or certain activities of a regulated non-banking entity. It holds in trust any unclaimed assets of a liquidated bank.
Finally, under Section 44 of the Banking Law, following notice and a hearing, the Superintendent may impose penalties to be paid to the State.
Scope.
The following is a brief description of each of type of entity regulated by the Department:
Banks & trust companies
The Banking Department charters and regulates banks and trust companies under Article III of the Banking Law. Historically, the Banking Department regulated both large domestic banks and smaller community and regional banks. However, the number of large domestic banks with state charters has been greatly reduced as a result of (i) mergers and (ii) “flipping” to federal charters by banks with operations in numerous other states who wanted to take advantage of a single set of nationwide federal rules, rather than complying with the consumer protection laws of all 50 states.
A trust company (which may be a stand-alone entity or be part of a bank that also conducts a general banking business) is an entity that is authorized by the Superintendent to exercise fiduciary (trust) powers.
Budget planners
A budget planner is a non-profit corporation that enters into a contract with a debtor under which the debtor agrees to pay a sum of money periodically to the budget planner, which the budget planner distributes among the debtor’s creditors. A budget planner also provides credit counseling and financial education. Section 456 of the General Business Law prohibits budget planning by anyone other than a non-profit corporation. Budget planners are licensed by the Banking Department under Article XII-C of the Banking Law.
Check cashers
A check casher is a person whose primary business is the cashing of checks, drafts or money orders for a fee. (A license is not required when a person cashes checks, drafts or money orders without charge, or when the person cashes checks, drafts or money orders as an incident to the conduct of another lawful business (e.g. a store) and not more than $1.00 is charged.) Check cashers are licensed by the Superintendent of Banks under Article IX-A of the Banking Law.
Credit unions
There are two forms of credit unions under Article 11 of the Banking Law. A credit union is a non-stock corporation (i.e. a membership corporation) whose members must either have a common employer or be members of the same trade, industry, profession, club, union, society or other association. Credit unions accept deposits from, make loans to and issue credit cards to their members, among other things. A corporate credit union is a credit union whose members are primarily other credit unions. New York state-chartered credit unions are also regulated by the National Credit Union Administration, which also insures credit union share accounts up to certain limits.
Foreign banks (branches, agencies and representative offices)
A New York branch is an office of a foreign bank that is licensed by the Superintendent to conduct a banking business in New York. A branch may exercise the same powers as a state-chartered commercial bank, including accepting deposits, making loans, issuing letters of credit, dealing in foreign exchange, making acceptances and, if authorized, exercising fiduciary powers. There are two types of foreign branches – insured and uninsured. An insured branch may conduct a retail banking business in New York, making consumer loans and accepting consumer deposits. An uninsured branch may accept deposits only as authorized by the FDIC Rules, with disclosure of their non-insured status. Since FDICIA was passed in 1991, no new insured branches have been allowed.
A New York agency has many of the same powers as a branch, except in the case of deposits. An agency may issue large-denomination ($100,000 or over) CDs, may accept deposits from foreign residents and citizens and may maintain credit balances for customers incidental to its banking business.
A foreign bank wishing merely to solicit business in the U.S. may establish a representative office to conduct research on the U.S. market and engage in marketing for the foreign bank. A representative office is not permitted to perform any core banking functions for the foreign bank or make any business decisions that would obligate the foreign bank, but it is permitted to engage in a number of activities not deemed to constitute the business of banking, including acting as liaison with customers and correspondents of the foreign bank, soliciting new business for the foreign bank, soliciting investors to buy loans from the foreign bank, and soliciting loans of $250,000 or more for the foreign bank.
Branches and agencies are covered in Article V of the Banking Law. Representative offices are covered in Article V-B of the Banking Law. Since 1991, they have also been subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.
Holding companies
For purposes of the Banking Law, a bank holding company is an entity (or natural person) that owns 10% or more of the voting stock, or otherwise controls, two or more New York banks or trust companies or national banks whose principal offices are located in New York State. Regulation of bank holding companies under Article III-A of the Banking Law is designed to prevent undue concentration of bank ownership. Consequently, unlike the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates all holding companies, even if they control only one bank, the Banking Department does not regulate one-bank holding companies.
Investment companies (Article XII)
An Article XII Investment company is a specialized non-depository lending institution that has broad borrowing and lending powers and may invest in stocks. An Article XII investment company may not accept “deposits” inside the U.S., although it may accept credit balances in New York that are incidental to the exercise of its other powers. Several foreign banks maintain Article XII investment companies. In addition, several large U.S. financial companies, including American Express, AIG, General Electric and Western Union, also have chartered Article XII investment companies.
Licensed lenders
A licensed lender is an entity engaged in the business of making loans in the principal amount of (i) $25,000 or less to any individual for personal, family, household, or investment purposes, or (ii) $50,000 or less for business and commercial loans, and which charges a rate of interest greater than 16% per annum.
Money transmitters
The business of money transmission includes the issuance and sale of traveler’s checks, issuance and sale of money orders, and the transmission of money on behalf of the public by any means including transmissions within this country or abroad by wire, check, draft, facsimile or courier. Generally, a money transmitter markets its services through a network of agents. Money transmitters are covered in Article XIII-B of the Banking Law.
Mortgage bankers
A mortgage banker is a person who engages in the business of making five or more mortgage loans in any one calendar year (other than certain exempted entities, including a banking organization and an insurance company). Mortgage bankers are subject to licensing by the Superintendent of Banks under Article XII-D of the Banking Law.
Mortgage brokers
A mortgage broker is a person who solicits, processes, places or negotiates a mortgage loan, but does not include a real estate broker or salesman, as defined in section 440 of the Real Property Law, if he does not directly or indirectly accept a fee for services rendered in connection with such solicitation, processing, placement or negotiation. Mortgage brokers are subject to registration by the Superintendent of banks under Article XII-D of the Banking Law. 
Mortgage loan originators
Under legislation passed in 2006 regulates mortgage loan originators (MLOs), who are individuals employed by or who have an independent contractor relationship with licensed mortgage bankers or registered mortgage brokers and who assist customers by soliciting, negotiating, explaining or finalizing the terms of a mortgage loan. MLOs are subject to a criminal background check and must complete certain educational requirements. MLOs are assessed fees that cover the cost of administering the registration program. MLOs are covered by Article XII-E of the banking Law.
Premium finance companies
A premium finance company enters into premium finance agreements with an insured person or acquires premium finance agreements from insurance agents or brokers or other premium finance agencies. A premium finance agreement is an arrangement under which a premium finance agency or an insurance broker or agent advances funds to an insurance company to pay an insurance premium on behalf of the insured and receives repayment by the insured over a period of time. Under Article XII-B of the Banking Law, the Banking Department licenses insurance finance agencies and regulates the terms of the finance agreement.
Private bankers
A private bank is a bank owned by an individual or a partnership. A private bank may engage generally in the full range of commercial banking activities, as well as in investment banking activities. 
Safe deposit companies
A safe deposit company acts as a custodian for storage of personal property and papers of any kind. It may also engage in the safe deposit business by renting vaults and safe deposit boxes. It cannot lend money or make advances on any property left in its possession. Safe Deposit Companies and the safe deposit business are covered in Articles VIII and VIII-A of the Banking Law.
Sales finance companies
A sales finance company acquires retail installment contracts or other credit agreements made by other parties. The term also includes a retail car dealer who holds retail installment contracts acquired from retail buyers, which have aggregate unpaid time balances of $25,000 or more. The term also includes a person who enters into retail installment credit agreements with retail buyers under Section 413(11) of the Personal Property Law. The Banking Department licenses persons to engage as sales finance companies (other than banks, savings bank, savings and loan associations, trust companies, private bankers or investment companies or licensed lenders) under Article XI-B of the Banking Law.
Savings banks and savings & loan associations
A savings bank or a savings and loan association is a type of financial institution whose main purpose is to take deposits from consumers and to make home mortgage loans or to invest in home mortgages. Some institutions also invest in commercial mortgages. Historically, savings banks were organized as mutual companies and savings and loan associations (S&Ls) were organized as stock companies. Savings banks and S&Ls are regulated, respectively, under Article 6 and Article 10 of the Banking Law. Deposits of each type of institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

State regulator associations.
National Association of State Credit Union Supervisors
State credit union regulators formed NASCUS in 1965 to ensure the safety and soundness of state-chartered credit unions. NASCUS, a professional regulators association, is the primary resource and voice of the 48 state governmental and U.S. territorial agencies that charter, regulate and examine the nation’s state-chartered credit unions. (Delaware, South Dakota and Wyoming have no laws permitting state-chartered credit unions.) NASCUS is the only organization dedicated to the defense and promotion of the dual chartering system and the autonomy of state credit union regulatory agencies.” 
Today, NASCUS also represents the interests of state agencies before Congress and is the liaison to federal agencies, including the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). NCUA is the chartering authority for federal credit unions and the administrator of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), the insurer of most state-chartered credit unions. NASCUS also provides examiner education programs for state agencies.
New York State Credit Union League
Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS)
CSBS is a national advocate for the state banking system. Its membership consists of state bank regulators, commissioners, etc. from all 50 states. Its mission is to educate, coordinate, advocate and communicate for the advancement of the state banking system.

Gabriel Guevrekian

Gabriel Guevrekian (or Guévrékian) (November 21, 1892 (?) Istanbul - October 29, 1970 Antibes) was an architect, who designed buildings, interiors and gardens, and taught architecture. He worked in Europe, Iran and the USA.
Biography.
Guevrekian was born by some accounts in 1900 (Imbert 1993, Turner 1996 ), by others in 1892. He was born in Constantinople, present day Istanbul, and then moved with his family to Tehran where he grew up. In 1910 he moved to Vienna where he lived with his uncle, architect Alex Galoustian. He studied architecture at the Kunstgewerbeschule with Oskar Strnad and Josef Hoffmann from 1915, and received his diploma in 1919. He then worked with Strnad and Hoffmann until he moved to Paris in 1922. In Paris he worked with le Corbusier, André Lurçat, Sigfried Giedion and Henri Sauvage. He worked with Robert Mallet-Stevens from 1922 until 1926, where he worked on the designs for Rue Mallet-Stevens while also pursuing his own projects. Guevrekian worked as an independent architect in Paris from 1926.
He was actively involved in the early stages of the "Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne" (CIAM) which he chaired from 1928 until 1932, a position appointed him by le Corbusier (Turner 1996). He co-founded the magazine L’architecture d’aujourd’hui. Josef Frank invited him to design two houses for the Werkbundsiedlung in Vienna in 1932.
In 1933 he returned to the newly established state of Iran on invitation of the government. He designed governmental and public buildings, including Kakh Dadgostari Tehran, residences and villas, of which little is documented. He returned to Europe in 1937 and worked in London for three years, but due to the advent of World War II none of his projects were realised. 1940 he returned to Paris where he worked on the development of pre-fabricated housing while also teaching in Saarbrücken. He then ceased work from 1940-44 refusing to work for the Nazis and the Vichy government in France.
After the war he worked with Georges-Henri Pingusson on rebuilding Saarbrücken and also taught architecture there. In 1948 he moved to the USA to teach at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute. He became professor at the University of Illinois the next year, and taught there until his retirement in 1969. Guevrekian became a U.S.-citizen in 1955.
After his retirement Gabriel Guevrekian returned to France with his wife. He died 29 October 1970 in Antibes.
Designs.
Robert Mallet-Stevens had produced earlier works like les Roses Rouges which were hailed as jardin moderne and jardin d'avant garde. He also designed a garden for the 1925 "Exposition des Arts Decoratifs". Through Mallet-Stevens, Guevrekian received an invitation to submit a modern rendering of the Persian Paradise Garden. (Wesley 1981 p. 17)
Garden of Water and Light.
The "Jardin d'Eau et de Lumiere" for the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs was an equilateral triangle broken up into triangular elements. In the centre were four tiered reflecting pools decorated by Robert Delaunay that sat below a rotating, internally illuminated sphere. These were surrounded by tiered plantings and hemmed in by two low walls of small triangles of glass in white and shades of pink. The sphere and the reflecting surfaces meant that light was reflected in all directions within the garden. By night the internally illuminated sphere projected light outwards enlivening the composition. (Imbert 1993 p. 128, Adams 1993 p. 32, Dodds 2002 p. 185)
Initially labelled in the press as a Persian garden, it eventually became referred to as the Cubist garden (Adams 1993 p. 30). For the same exposition, Guevrekian designed a pavilion for Sonia Delaunay and Jacques Heim.
Cubist garden at Villa Noailles.
His subsequent garden for Charles and Marie-Laure de Noailles at Villa Noailles had an imposed space whose triangular shape the clients and Mallet-Stevens viewed as suited to Guevrekian's new design style. Noailles had consulted both Mies van der Rohe and le Corbusier before employing Mallet-Stevens. He wanted artifice in his landscape. The Villa commanded great views of the Côte d’Azur and Noailles wished to contrast this strongly with an enclosed and architectonic ensemble that framed the natural whilst delineating ownership. (Imbert 1997 p. 130-132)
The disregard for the needs of the plants in the Noailles garden and the differing growth rates soon disrupted the balance of the design and prompted Charles de Noailles, himself a famous amateur gardener, to replant the design entirely, not long after its instigation. It was, however, a progression on the Paris garden by its regard for physical occupation.
Villa Heim.
For Jacques Heim Guevrekian designed Villa Heim, built 1927-1930. He also designed the interior and furniture, and a garden consisting of a series of rectangular terraces. Villa Heim featured in L'Illustration and L'Architecte.
Guevrekian was well involved with the CIAM by this time and had shifted to a more functional style. The house has since been modified extensively and has been split into two apartments.
Readings of his work.
Whether that was the artist's intention, as for subsequent gardens, is hard to determine. As Imbert points out "due to the paucity of written evidence, the garden designers’ intentions remain largely undocumented; that they appreciated the implications of the cubist movement for their field, however, is most certain. (Imbert 1997 p. 169) Criticisms of the work as being too literal a translation of, or direct reference to, cubist painting is both unfair and imperceptive (and usually based on Wesley's critique or similar ideas). Although his primary artistic medium was painting, Guevrekian designed with more influences than cubist painting and a greater understanding of modern media and techniques than he is often given credit for. Also, criticism of the Paris garden shows a complete disregard for the Persian Paradise garden element which was his primary brief.
George Dodds provides this reading of the Paradise garden; "Paradise garden are idealised and isolated enclaves in which a water element representing the four rivers of paradise divides the space into four equal precincts." (Dodds 2002 p. 192) Given the very limited space that Guevrekian had to work with and the need for people to be able to parade past, Dodds reads the four reflection pools as being this element with the garden halved for convenience. "The early Mesopotamian settlers conceived of the sky as a triangle and depicted it as a mountain. The moon, which brought relief from the relentless sun, was depicted as a tree atop the mountain of the sky. As trees mark an oasis and the moon is a life-giver, so the sap of the moon-tree must be water – the elixir of life." (Dodds 2002 p. 192-193) Guevrekian uses the metal sphere as both representative of the moon and tree, a technique he uses in later designs. The tree feeds the "water" in the pools below and the plants beyond.
Dodds also reads the form as being a "straight-up" axonometric rather than the "shallow and compressed" perspective that Wesley draws directly from Picasso. (Dodds 2002 p. 191) Guevrekian uses the axonometric, a popular architectural type where all measurements remain true in an idealised form. He develops this idea further with Robert and Sonia Delauny, whose simultaneist art he draws upon and whom he later works with to form the purist movement.
The main criticism of Guevrekian's gardens is that he fails to truly translate the two dimensional medium of cubist painting into the three dimensionality of a garden. Indeed, is it possible to return a style that essentially compresses into two dimensions three spatial dimensions, and a fourth of time, back in to an essentially four dimensional medium? This criticism supposes that was his intention. Modern readings see Guevrekian's awareness of the print media, of the transience of his gardens and their use as stepping stones to a future not yet visible. (Dodds 2002, Imbert 1997)

Miguel Lopes

Hugo Miguel Almeida Costa Lopes (born 19 December 1986) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Olympique Lyonnais on loan from Sporting Clube de Portugal as a right defender.
Club career.
Born in Lisbon, Lopes started his professional career with S.L. Benfica's B-team. In the following summer, he moved to the lower leagues with C.D. Operário.
After some solid displays, Lopes signed in 2007–08 with second division's Rio Ave FC. In his first season he was an habitual starter, as the Vila do Conde side returned to the top flight after two years.
In the 2008–09 campaign Lopes helped Rio Ave to home draws against Benfica and F.C. Porto, and was again featured regularly, thus prompting interest from bigger teams. In January 2009, he agreed to a four-year deal with Porto: in his first season, having to compete with Uruguayan Jorge Fucile for a starting berth, he appeared sparingly in the league but did manage to play in 17 official games, 13 as a starter.
In late August 2010, deemed surplus to requirements by new Porto manager André Villas-Boas as practically all Portuguese players in the team, Lopes moved to Spanish side Real Betis on a one-year loan deal. He passed his medical and was unveiled on 2 September, eventually appearing in exactly half of the league games during the season as the Andalusians returned to La Liga after three years.
Lopes spent the first part of 2011–12 unregistered by Porto. In the January transfer window he was loaned to fellow league club S.C. Braga, going on to start in seven of his league appearances as it finished third and qualified to the UEFA Champions League for the second time in its history.
Lopes returned to Porto for the 2012–13 campaign. On 29 September he scored through a rare header, opening the score in an eventual 2–2 draw at former team Rio Ave; however, in January 2013, he joined fellow Big Three side Sporting Clube de Portugal on a five 1/2-year contract, with Marat Izmailov moving in the opposite direction.
On 7 July 2013 Lopes moved to Olympique Lyonnais in Ligue 1, on a one-year loan deal.
International career.
Due to his ability to play as both a right and a left back, Lopes was selected by Portugal coach Paulo Bento for his UEFA Euro 2012 squad. He made his national team debut on 2 June, a 1–3 friendly loss with Turkey in Lisbon.
Personal.
Lopes' twin brother, Nuno, is also a footballer and a right-back. Both came through exactly the same youth system setup, with the exception of Benfica.

Mandela (1996 film)

Mandela (aka Mandela: Son of Africa, Father of a Nation) is a 1996 documentary film directed by Angus Gibson and Jo Menell. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.
Plot.
The documentary is the official film biography of Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president of the ethnically united South Africa. The film touches on Nelson Mandela's childhood, family, education, and his long struggle to gain freedom for all the various ethnic groups in South Africa, including his experiences on the Robben Island prison.
Reception.
Film critic Roger Ebert, writing for the "Chicago Sun-Times", liked the film but felt more information should have been included, especially the motivations of F.W. de Klerk. He wrote, "The actual story of the events leading to the election is more complicated and interesting. Yes, South Africa suffered from economic sanctions. But it could have survived for many years before caving in; it forged clandestine trading arrangements with countries ranging from China to Israel, and its diamonds still found their way onto the fingers of brides all over the world. Civil unrest was widespread, but South Africa had a fearsome array of police and military forces to counter it. If white South Africa had been adamant, apartheid would still be law...None of those events are told in "Mandela," which simplifies the transfer of power into a fable of black against white; it all but implies that de Klerk was unwilling to see power change hands."
Critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat liked the film and wrote, "Directors Jo Menell and Angus Gibson give us an up-close and personal portrait of this black hero...This inspiring and edifying screen biography celebrates Mandela as a freedom fighter and a liberator — the father of a nation."

South Carolina Federal Credit Union

South Carolina Federal Credit Union (or South Carolina Federal) is a credit union headquartered in North Charleston, South Carolina, that is supervised and insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), an agency of the U.S. government. South Carolina Federal in June 2008 was one of the 100 largest credit unions in the nation by asset size. As of October 2008, South Carolina Federal had over $1.4 billion USD in assets and over 156,000 active members.
In 2007 and 2008, South Carolina Federal was recognized among the Best Places to Work in South Carolina.
History.
South Carolina Federal originated on Jan. 31, 1936, at the Charleston Naval Shipyard (Charleston Navy Yard) in North Charleston, S.C., when fourteen Navy Shipyard workers each contributed $5 (for a total investment of $70) to create the Navy Yard Employees Credit Union.
In 1960, the credit union changed its name to the Charleston Naval Shipyard (CNS) Federal Credit Union when its field of membership expanded to include Navy personnel who worked at the Navy Yard or were stationed/home-ported at the naval base. In 1965, CNS became the first credit union in South Carolina to have its own facility. By 1969, CNS opened its first branch on the Naval Station. Other branch locations quickly followed.
During the 1980s, CNS capitalized on legal changes that enabled credit unions to serve as full-service financial institutions. The NCUA during this time also allowed credit unions to open their fields of membership to "unlike groups," permitting CNS to accept members from groups or organizations beyond those associated with the Shipyard.
These developments contributed to several smaller credit unions merging with CNS during the 80s. By the end of 1985, as CNS was nearing its 50th anniversary, it had assets of $221 million and served 103,844 members.
The U.S. Navy closed the Charleston Naval Shipyard and naval base on April 1, 1994, but CNS’ member base was robust enough that the credit union was able to withstand the loss. In recognition of the changed environment and the credit union’s broad membership, CNS changed its name on August 9, 1994, to South Carolina Federal Credit Union.
During the 1990s, South Carolina Federal expanded beyond the Charleston area for the first time, into Georgetown and Columbia, S.C. In 2003, South Carolina Federal changed its status from a select employer group to a community-chartered credit union. In May 2004, South Carolina Federal reached a major financial landmark when assets hit $1 billion.
Organization.
South Carolina Federal is a community-chartered credit union. This means South Carolina Federal can serve anyone who lives, works, worships or attends school within certain community boundaries as defined by the NCUA. (See “Membership” below.)
Credit unions are owned and governed by the people who use its services. Those people are called “members” and each member is an equal owner of the institution. Members elect and serve as the credit union’s volunteer board of directors, which establishes and reviews policies, based on what is best for the collective membership. 
South Carolina Federal’s Supervisory Committee, made up of volunteers appointed by the board, is responsible to ensure that the credit union’s financial condition is presented accurately in financial statements and that management practices and procedures safeguard members' assets.
Membership.
Specifically, membership in South Carolina Federal is open to anyone who lives, works, worships or attends school in Berkeley, Calhoun, Charleston, Clarendon, Dorchester, Georgetown or Orangeburg counties, and certain eligible areas of Richland and Lexington counties, S.C. Also eligible are those who have a relative that is a member of South Carolina Federal, or persons with at least one relative who meets the criteria for membership stated above. [“Relatives” include spouses, children (including adopted, foster and stepchildren), parents, grandparents, grandchildren, siblings, and members of the same household.] 
Services.
South Carolina Federal is a full-service credit union that offers consumer and business products and services that are comparable to most larger financial institutions. Products and services include personal checking, savings, debit and credit cards and loans, and business checking, business savings, business debit and credit cards and business loans suitable for members who own small businesses. South Carolina Federal also offers free financial education workshops to its members, the public and businesses within its field of membership. Membership also includes free access to financial counseling services at BALANCE Financial Fitness Program.
As of November 2008, South Carolina Federal had 23 branches and 81 ATMs in the state of South Carolina. Members also had free access to over 26,000 CO-OP Network ATMs nationwide. South Carolina Federal offered online services and information 24-7 via its website, scfederal.org. 
Competition.
In December 2007, South Carolina Federal was the second largest credit union (by asset size) in the state of South Carolina; however, it was among numerous credit unions allowed by the NCUA to serve people in its field of membership. South Carolina Federal counts among its competitors other credit unions, such as Heritage Trust Federal Credit Union, and banks, such as First Federal Bank, that maintain a presence in the same local areas and offer a relatively comparable suite of products.

Gartered Trogon

The Gartered Trogon ("Trogon caligatus"), also known as the Northern Violaceous Trogon, is a near passerine bird in the trogon family, Trogonidae. It is found in forests in east-central Mexico, south through Central America, to north-western South America (west or north of the Andes in Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela). It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the otherwise exclusively South American Violaceous Trogon ("T. violaceus").
Behavior.
It nests in a wasp, ant or termite nest or a hole in a rotten tree, with a typical clutch of two or three white eggs.
Gartered Trogons feed on insects and small fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. They typically perch upright and motionless.
Description.
Most trogons have distinctive male and female plumages, with soft, often colourful, feathers. The Gartered Trogon is a relatively small species at about in length. The head and upper breast of the male are blue and the back is green, becoming bluer on the rump. A faint white line separates the breast from the orange-yellow underparts. The undertail is white with black barring, and the wings are black, vermiculated with white. The complete eye-ring is yellow. The female Violaceous Trogon resembles the male, but has a dark grey back, head and breast, and an incomplete white eye-ring.
The shade of the blue of the head in the male differs between the Violaceous Trogon and the Gartered Trogon, but (disregarding their separate distributions) the voice is the main distinction between the two. The Gartered has a slurred whistled "cuh-cuh-cuh", and Violaceous has a soft "cow cow, cow".

Q65 (band)

Q65 was a Dutch Garage rock/Psychedelic rock/Rhythm and blues group formed in 1965 and categorised in the Netherlands as being part of the Nederbeat genre.
Biography.
1965: Formation.
Q65 was formed in early 1965 when guitarists Joop Roelofs and Frank Nuyens decide to start a band with singer Willem Bieler. The line-up was completed by bass player Peter Vink and drummer Jay Baar. The band was inspired by rhythm and blues traditionals and the songs of Robert Johnson and Willie Dixon as well as The Kinks, The Animals and The Rolling Stones. Q65 started their performances in the Spring of 1965. During a concert at skating ring De Eenhoorn, they met producer Peter Koelewijn. Very impressed by their show, he invited them to an audition at the Phonogram studio, where they recorded two of their own songs; "And Your Kind" and "You're The Victor". Koelewijn decided to release them on vinyl.
1966-1968: The Golden Years.
In January 1966, their debut single "You're The Victor" was released and later peaked at #11 on the Dutch Top 40. Then Hans van Hemert replaced Koelewijn. Two other singles reached the Dutch charts the same year; "The Life I Live" (#5) and "I Despise You" (#19). Under Van Hemert's guidance their first album entitled "Revolution" was recorded and released by Decca Records. In 1967, they hit the charts again with the singles "From Above" (#13) and "World of birds" (#8). Due to drug problems and military service duties of singer Wim Bieler, Q65 disbanded in 1968.
Comeback.
Q65 reformed in 1970, with Beer Klaasse on drums, and signed to Negram Records, staying together for one year and two LPs, "Afghanistan" and "We Are Gonna Make It", which had a slightly more psychedelic orientation. Q65's line-up changed during the early 1970s as Nuyens exited to join Baar in a band called Rainman, while Q65 continued with a new line-up, featuring John Frederikz on vocals and Joop van Nimwegen on guitar. The original Q65 reunited in 1980 and toured that year. The group continued in various configurations in the mid-1980s. Jay Baar died in 1990, but a version of the band, with Wim Bieler as leader, continued playing into the 1990s.

Don M Stromquist House

The Don M. Stromquist House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is located on a ten-acre site in Bountiful, Utah. At an altitude of , it consists of the main house, an office/laboratory/garage annex, a gardener's shed and a barn. It is sited halfway down an arroyo or canyon wall. The house has an endless view of the Great Salt Lake and Antelope Island.
Architect.
Frank Lloyd Wright designed the house on a grid of 60 and 120 degree angles which formed a series of parallelograms. The grid lines are poured in the concrete floors, and the ceiling has the same grid lines reflected in small strips of wood. The house is constructed from salmon colored concrete-blocks, steel beams, glass and philippine mahogany. 
Wright drew up plans for the furniture, further unifying the look with a dining room table, the lines of which mirror the grid in the floor, built-in settees, lamp tables and book shelves. Freestanding furniture designed by Wright, included a coffee table and hassocks. Even the fireplace tools, with half-diamond shapes on the handles, were designed by the architect.
Main structure.
The main house features three small bedrooms, two granite-clad (an addition Stromquist made after he repurchased the home) bathrooms, a kitchen, semi-formal dining, 
laundry, utility room, two fireplaces, and two balconies. Clerestory windows provide natural lighting. The master bedroom has its own fireplace and French doors that lead to a secluded balcony. Heating is provided by a combined radiant/forced air system that utilizes two natural gass furnaces, which was designed by Wesley Peters, Wright's son-in-law and chief engineer.
As a boy, Don Stromquist had attended a speech by Frank Lloyd Wright, and was impressed. When it was time for him to build a home, he asked Wright to design it. Construction on the home began in 1959 and was completed in 1961 at a cost of about $32,000.00, when Stromquist and his wife, Jane, were newlyweds. Wright died in 1959, before the house was completed. After living in the home for several years, the home was purchased by Mr. Stromquist's employeer, U.S. Steel, when Mr. Stromquist's position was relocated to the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Thirty years later, the couple moved back to Utah to find that the house had been abandoned, vandalized, and eventually sold as horse property. George M. Frandsen and his partner, David A. Carlquist, both Utah natives, later bought the home and restored it to the details of the original architectural drawings. Taliesin Associated Architects John deKoven Hill and Cornelia Breirly oversaw the restoration. Ms. Breirly had been Wright's color and fabric consultant when the home was first designed. At the completion of the restoration she commented that the home was the best preserved example of Wright's Usonian architecture. During the ten years the home was owned by Frandsen and Carlquist, fundraising events were frequently held there to benefit local nonprofit organizations, including the couple's favorite, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The Stromquists were members of the ACLU and were invited to speak at a fundraising event held in the home and gardens. A friendship between the Stromquists and the men developed. Later, when the men decided to move from Utah, they sold the home to the Stromquists, who moved back into the house. Mrs. Stromquist died there a short time later. The home has been unoccupied for the past approximately 15 years.

Aston Hall, Aston-on-Trent

Aston Hall is an 18th-century country house, now converted to residential apartments, at Aston-on-Trent, Derbyshire. It is a Grade II* listed building.
At the time of the Norman conquest, Aston-on-Trent was part of the Manor of Weston which was granted by the Crown to the Earl of Chester and by him to the Abbey of St Werburgh at Chester. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Manor was granted to Sir William Paget. In 1612 Weston passed to Anthony Roper by marriage and in 1633 he purchased the house and estate at Aston. In 1648 he sold the estate to Robert Holden of Shardlow.
His descendant, also Robert Holden, was a successful lawyer who replaced the old house with a new red brick three storey five bayed mansion. The house was greatly extended by the addition of a substantial north wing and other improvements by Edward Anthony Holden who was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1838. The whole edifice was rendered and painted.
The estate was sold by the Holdens in 1898 to William Dicken Winterbottom. In 1924 it was broken up and the house was sold to Nottingham County Council and became a hospital. More recently it has been restored, renovated and converted into residential apartments.

Marc Feldmann

Sir Marc Feldmann FAA (born 2 December 1944) is an Australian immunologist, and a professor at the University of Oxford where he is a head of the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology.
Biography.
Feldmann was born 2 December 1944 in Lvov, Poland near the Russian border to a Jewish family who managed to get to France immediately postwar (i). He emigrated from France to Australia at age eight. After graduating with an MBBS degree from the University of Melbourne in 1967, he earned a Ph.D. in Immunology at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in 1972 with Sir Gustav Nossal (i).
He moved to London in the 1970s, working first with Professor Avrion Mitchison at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's Tumour Immunology Unit, then in 1985 moved to the Charing Cross Sunley Research Centre and the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology which joined with the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College in 2000 and in August 2011 the Kennedy Institite of Rheumatology transferred to the University of Oxford.
In the 1980s he published a new hypothesis for the mechanism of induction of autoimmune diseases, highlighting the role of cytokines (ii). Cytokines are potent signalling proteins, local hormones, which drive important processes like inflammation, immunity and cell growth. This model was validated in experiments with thyroid disease tissue. From 1984 he collaborated with Ravinder N. Maini at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology to study disease mechanism in rheumatoid arthritis, a much more clinically important autoimmune disease, affecting 1% of the population.
In autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks and damages the body, leading to disease of various organs, for example joints in rheumatoid arthritis. Feldmann's group demonstrated that diseased joints have far more pro-inflammatory cytokines than normal, and identified one of these, Tumour Necrosis Factor Alpha, abbreviated TNFα as the key (iii).
Blocking TNFα reduced levels of the other pro-inflammatory cytokines in test-tube models of arthritis (iv), and this provided the rationale for testing TNF blockade in rheumatoid arthritis patients which had failed all existing treatment. 
The first of a series of successful clinical trials was performed in 1992, at Charing Cross Hospital, using an antibody, infliximab from Centocor, a biotech now part of Johnson and Johnson.
The success led to other companies joining the race to market, and by 1998 (v), etanercept (Enbrel) (vi) was approved for treatment in the US, and by 1999, infliximab (Remicade) was also approved. Now there are 5 approved anti-TNF drugs, and they are extensively used, with more than 2 million successfully treated patients. 
Since then, TNFα inhibitors have become the therapy of choice for stopping the inflammatory and tissue-destructive pathways of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (vii).

MS Golden Princess

MS "Golden Princess was a casino cruise ship owned by Eurasia International, operated on short casino cruises out of Hong Kong. She was built in 1967 by the Wärtsilä Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki, Finland as Finlandia for the Finland Steamship Company. In 1975 she was sold to Finnlines, who converted her into the cruise ship Finnstar in 1978. In 1982 she entered service for Pearl Cruises as Pearl of Scandinavia. In 1988 she was renamed Ocean Pearl. In 1994 she entered service with Croisières Paquet as Pearl. Between 1995 and 1998 she sailed for Costa Cruises as Costa Playa. In 1998-1999 she sailed as Oriental Pearl for Mega Wave International, and in 1999-2000 as Joy Wave for Costa Cruises. In 2000 she was sold to Eurasia International and entered service under the name Golden Princess" . In 2009 she was sold for scrap to China.
Concept and construction.
During the early 1960s Finland Steamship Company's service between Finland, Denmark and West Germany was operated by ageing steamers with no car decks, the newest of which had been built in 1927. Finnlines had started competing with Finland SS Co on the service to West Germany in 1962 with the car/passenger ferry "Hansa Express". Two notably larger ferries—"Finnhansa" and "Finnpartner"—were under construction, due to enter service on the service with Finnlines in 1966. In order to compete with Finnlines' state-of-the-art ferries, Finland SS Co placed an order for an even larger car/passenger ferry with Wärtsilä Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki, Finland on 8 April 1965. The new ship could accommodate 1000 passengers, with berths for 647 of them. In keeping with the liner tradition the berths wede divided between first and tourist class. The same shipyard was in fact building the new Finnlines vessels at the time Finland SS Co placed their order.
The concept of the new Finland SS Co vessel, eventually to be named "Finlandia", was essentially the same as that of "Ilmatar", built by the Wärtsilä shipyard for Finland SS Co in 1964. A notable exception was that the new "Finlandia" would be built with a full-length car-deck that could be accessed from gates both in the stern and bow, whereas the "Ilmatar" had a smaller, side-loadable car deck. The "Finlandia"s large size meant she could replace all three steamers operated by Finland SS Co on the service to West Germany.
The "Finlandia" was launched on 25 August 1966 and named on the same date by Mrs. Louise Ehrnrooth, wife of Finnish banker Göran Ehrnrooth. She was completed on 10 May 1967, and delivered to Finland Steamship Company on the same date on a cruise outside the Harmaja lighthouse in Helsinki. Finnish president Urho Kekkonen and his wife were invited guests on board the delivery cruise, which was made in heavy fog.
Rebuildings.
The ship that started her career as the "Finlandia" has been rebuilt many times. The first notable refitting took place in February–March 1974, when the "Finlandia" was fitted with retractable fin stabilisers.
Between 5 September 1978 and 3 January 1979 the "Finlandia" was heavily rebuilt at the Wärtsilä Turku shipyard. To facilitate dual use as a ferry on the Baltic during the summer high season and cruising during the remainder of the year, her interiors and accommodations were upgraded to cruise ship standards, with new cabins were installed on the upper level of the car deck, while the lower level of the car deck was retained so that she could continue transporting passenger cars. At the same time the bow gate was sealed, so that cars could only be loaded and unloaded from the stern. Following the reconstruction she could accommodate 576 all-berth passengers. Externally the midship dummy funnel was removed and the exhaust pipes in the rear redesigned. Coinciding with the reconstruction she was renamed "Finnstar".
Following sale to Loki Shipping, the ship was radically rebuilt into a full-time cruise ship at Aalborg Vaerft in Ålborg, Denmark between August 1981 and April 1982. The lower car deck was built in with cabins, and new penthouse suites were added on the top deck. The existing cabins were enlarged, so that the ship could accommodate just 515 passengers. With the elimination of the car deck the stern doors were sealed, a bulbous bow replaced the original icebreaker bow, and sponsons were fitted aft to increase stability. Following this reconstruction the ship was renamed "Pearl of Scandinavia".
Between 5 January and 14 February 1988 the ship was again rebuilt, this time at the Sembawang Shipyard in Singapore. During the refit a new sharply raked bow was fitted, increasing the ship's length by and the exhaust pipes replaced by a new aluminium funnel. After this rebuilding the ship was renamed "Ocean Pearl" by HRH Princess Galyani Vadhana of Thailand.
Service history.
1967–1975: Finland Steamship Company.
The new "Finlandia" entered service on Finland Steamship Company's service connecting Helsinki, Finland to Travemünde, West Germany via Copenhagen, Denmark on 25 May 1967. She was the largest car/passenger ferry in the world at the time and the fastest ferry on the Baltic Sea, capable crossing the Baltic in just 44 hours. Her facilities were notably superior to the old Finland SS Co ships she had replaced, and she gained immediate popularity. On 23 January 1968 the "Finlandia" collided with the West German freighter "Brook" in the Kustaanmiekka strait outside Helsinki. "Finlandia" survived the encounter without notable damage. On 27 June of the same year the "Finlandia" evacuated two Danish citizens from a burning motor boat outside Stevns, Denmark. In December 1968 she also became the first ship to be docked at Valmet's new 12,000 ton drydock at Katajanokka, Helsinki.
Faced with competition in the form of the "Finlandia", it became clear Finnlines could not operate both their "Finnhansa" and "Finnpartner" in the service to West Germany. As a result the "Finnpartner" was sold to Rederi AB Svea in 1969. Following the sale Finnlines and Finland SS Co entered a joint service agreement in February 1969. Although the joint service was marketed as Itämeren-laivat (), both ships used on the service maintained the separate liveries of their respectable operators. Plans were also made for a joint subsidiary of Finland SS Co and Finnlines to operate the service to West Germany, but these were never realised.
The "Finlandia" enjoyed an eventful career with Finland Steamship Company until 1975. On 24 March 1970 a passenger fell ill on board and had to be carried to a hospital in Visby, Gotland by a helicopter. On 31 May 1970 she suffered an engine room fire while in the Bay of Finland. The fire was put out by the crew, but the ship was delayed by three hours. In February 1971 she had to ber docked at the Eriksbergs varv in Gothenburg, Sweden due to a metal worker's strike in Finland. On 3 April 1972 the a tanker truck capsized on the car deck during a heavy storm outside the Hiiumaa lighthouse, crushing four cars.
In 1975, faced with an economical downturn and increased fuel prices, Finland Steamship Company and Finnlines decided to reorganise their operations and extend their joint operations to cargo shipping. The primary result of this was the formation of Finncarriers as a joint cargo-carrying subsidiary. However, as a part of the agreement Finnlines took over the entire Finland-West Germany traffic and with it the "Finlandia". An important factor in Finland SS Co withdrawing from the passenger service to West Germany was also , a new ship due to enter service for Finnlines in 1977 that would have a high enough capacity to replace all existing passenger-carrying ships on the Finland—West Germany service.
1975–1981: Finnlines.
Enso-Gutzeit, the owner of Finnlines, took over the "Finlandia" from Finland Steamship Company on 16 June 1975, ceding "Finncarrier" to Finland SS Co in exchange. Apart from being painted in Finnlines' livery, the "Finlandia" continued without changes—she retained her old name, her old homeport and her old route, with a call at Copenhagen in addition to Helsinki and Travemünde (Finnlines' "Finnhansa" in comparison called at Nynäshamn, Sweden instead of Copenhagen).
While in the port of Travemünde on 1 July 1975 a fire broke out in the "Finlandia"s galley. Before the fire could be controlled, it spread to the radio cabin and officer's mess. The galley, radio cabin and mess were all destroyed by the fire, and the ship had to be repaired at Kiel, Germany before she could proceed with normal service. On 13 September 1975 the "Finlandia" rescued seven people from the sinking German yacht "Jan II" south of Gedser, Denmark. Two weeks later the "Finlandia" rescued two East German refugees sailing in an inflatable boat, again south of Gedser.
The new "Finnjet" was delivered to Enso-Gutzeit in May 1977, replacing the "Finlandia" in the Finland-Germany service. As a result the "Finlandia" was chartered to TT-Saga Line between May and August 1977 for service on the Helsingborg—Malmö—Travemünde route. In November 1977 the "Finlandia" returned to service with Finnlines as a freighter on the Helsinki—Copenhagen—Lübeck service for duration of eight weeks. After this she remained laid up until the summer season of 1978, when she returned to service on the Finland—Germany run.
Finnlines projected that they would need to retain the "Finlandia" as a second ship on the Finland—Germany run during the high season, but needed an alternate use for her during the rest of the year. The company had operated "Finnpartner" and "Bore Star" as cruise ships with limited success during the winters between 1973 and 1977. Now the decision was made to convert the "Finlandia"s interiors into cruise ship standards, while partially retaining her car deck. Following rebuilding at Wärtsilä's Turku shipyard the ship was renamed "Finnstar" and re-entered service on 8 January 1979 with a cruise on the west coast of Africa. During the winter season she made cruises on the African coast for Finnlines, during the spring and autumn she cruised on the Mediterranean and Norwegian fjords under charter to Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, and during the summer she was used by Finnlines as a ferry on the Helsinki—Slite—Copenhagen run, as well as on cruises from Helsinki to Leningrad, Slite and Tallinn. On 19 November 1979 she became the first Finnish-flagged cruise ship to cross the Equator.
Like Finnlines' previous attempts to enter the cruise business, the "Finnstar" proved to be largely unsuccessful. She was relatively small vessel, unable to cater to the expectations of the international market. Her operational costs were also notably higher than those of her main competitors. Her West African cruises were too high-class to be sold at a reasonable price on the small Finnish cruise market. An additional factor was the competition from "Finnstar"s former fleetmate "Ilmatar" that was used on similar cruises aimed at the Finnish market by Silja Line. The "Finnstar"s prospect were further worsened in 1980, when crewing costs increased following the Finnish Maritime Strike of 1980. As a result of the increasing losses generated by the ship, Finnlines decided to give up their cruise traffic in 1980. The "Finnstar"s last cruise terminated in Barcelona on 12 September 1980. Subsequently she sailed to Toulon, France where she was laid up on 14 September 1980 and placed for sale.
1981–1994: Pearl Cruises.
The "Finnstar" remained laid up at Toulon until 27 May 1981, when she was sold to Loke Shipping, a joint venture between the Norway-based I.M. Skaugen and J. Lauritzen shipping companies, who planned to use the ship for cruising out of Hong Kong and Singapore. Temporarily renamed "Innstar", the ship sailed for Toulon to Ålborg where she was rebuilt into a cruise ship by Aalborg Vaerft. The ship was delivered following the reconstruction in April 1982, renamed "Pearl of Scandinavia" and reregistered in the Bahamas. She sailed to Hong Kong, embarking on 14, 28 and 42 day cruises in East and Southeast Asia for Pearl Cruises of Scandinavia in June 1982.
On 1 September 1983 I.M. Skaugen withdrew from the Pearl Cruises of Scandinavia venture, leaving J. Lauritzen as the sole owner of the "Pearl of Scandinavia". This change of ownership had no effect on her service. In April 1987 Pearl Cruises of Scandinavia were sold to 2000 Corporation. Despite the fact the 2000 Corporation already owned another cruise line, Ocean Cruise Lines, the Pearl Cruises of Scandinavia brand was retained for the "Pearl of Scandinavia", although the company name was simplified to simply Pearl Cruises.
Between January and February 1988 the "Pearl of Scandinavia" was again rebuilt, this time at the Sembawang Shipyard in Singapore. On 14 February she was renamed "Ocean Pearl" by HRH Princess Galyani Vadhana of Thailand and subsequently re-entered service. Throughout these changes Loki Shipping remained the ship's owners. In April 1990 Ocean Cruise Lines were acquired by the France-based Croisières Paquet. Two months later Loki Shipping sold the "Ocean Pearl" to Sendumar. Despite these changes the ship continued in Asian cruise service for Pearl Cruises. In 1992 Croisières Paquet also acquired the "Ocean Pearl".
1994–1995: Croisières Paquet.
In February 1994 the "Ocean Pearl"s marketing was taken over by Croisières Paquet. She was renamed "Pearl" and reregistered in France, but continued cruising in the Asian market until 14 September 1995.
1995–1998: Costa Cruises.
The Italy-based Costa Cruises had absorbed Croisières Paquet in 1994. As a result of this the "Pearl" was withdrawn from Croisières Paquet service in 14 September 1995. She then sailed to the T. Mariotti shipyard in Genoa, Italy. Following the refit the entered service with Costa Cruises as "Costa Playa" on 12 November 1995. At the same time she returned under the Bahamian flag. The "Costa Playa" was used for cruises in the Caribbean with Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, as the port of departure. She was the first cruise ship to visit Cuba since the end of the Cold War, calling at Santiago de Cuba, Havana and Baia Nipe during her cruises.
1998–2000: Mega Wave International and Costa Cruises.
The "Costa Playa" was withdrawn from service with Costa Cruises in January 1998. She was sold to the Hong Kong-based Mega Wave International and renamed "Oriental Pearl". Whether she was ever used in active service by Mega Wave is unknown. In August 1999 her ownership again passed to Costa Cruises and she was renamed "Joy Wave". Again it is unknown is she was actually used in active service as the "Joy Wave".
2000-2009: Eurasia International.
In November 2000 the "Joy Wave" was sold to Eurasia International, another Hong Kong-based company, who refitted her as the casino cruise ship "Golden Princess". The "Golden Princess" entered service on casino cruises out of Hong Kong in November 2000. In July 2009, her owners sold her to China for scrapping.
Design.
Exterior design.
Externally the "Finlandia" was designed with a classical hull-shape, with a notable sheer on the hull, a long bow, and a terraced rear superstructure. In keeping with traditional liner aesthetic, the ship was given a large midship dummy funnel. In reality the exhausts from the engines were emitted from two smaller exhaust pipes attached to the rear mast of the ship. In Finland Steamship Company service the ship was painted with a white hull and superstructure, with two narrow black stripes painted along the length of the hull on the level of the top of the car deck. In the bow the stripes were interrupted by the ship's name, painted on dark yellow. The dummy funnel was painted in the Finland SS Co colours, black with two white horizontal stripes.
When the "Finlandia" passed under Finnlines ownership, she was painted in the then-current Finnlines colours, with the two black decorative stripes on the hull replaced by a wider blue stripe. The hull was painted grey below the blue stripe and white above. The black Effoa funnel colours were replaced by Finnlines' passenger services funnel colours, white with a white/blue stripe and a large white emblem with a black "F" in the center.
When the "Finlandia" was converted into the "Finnstar", the dummy funnel was removed and the exhaust pipes heightened and remodelled, with a small smoke deflector structure added behind them. A new colour scheme was adopted, with a white hull and superstructure. The ship's name was painted on the hull with grey letters, in a style that appeared handwritten. Wide blue stripes were painted running along the windows of the bridge deck and the lowest superstructure deck. The exhaust pipes were repainted blue and the deflector structure white with a small "F" on it. The "Finnstar" was the first ship to utilise a livery with blue stripes painted along the windows; two years later it was adopted by Silja Line and subsequently became strongly associated with them.
As the "Pearl of Scandinavia" a box-like penthouse suite structure was added on the top deck, between the bridge and the exhaust pipes, while sponsons were added to the rear hull. As a new livery the ship was painted all-white, with blue exhaust pipe/deflector structure. Pearl Cruises' "waves and crown" logo was painted on the hull. During a part of her service as "Pearl of Scandinavia" the ship had an additional blue horizontal decorative stripe painted in the middle of the hull.
When "Pearl of Scandinavia" became "Ocean Pearl", her bow was replaced with a more sharply raked one, and the exhaust pipe structure with a sweeping funnel. As a new livery she was painted all-white, with the Pearl Cruises logo on blue in the white funnel. As "Pearl" she retained the same external shape, but with the blue/red Croisières Paquet logo replacing the Pearl Cruises logo on the funnel, and a narrow blue/red decorative stripe on the hull following the same line as the original black decorative stripes. As "Costa Playa" she was repainted in the Costa Cruises livery with an all-white hull and superstructure topped with a yellow funnel with a blue "C" on it. The liveries the ship carried as "Oriental Pearl" and "Joy Wave" are unknown.
As "Golden Princess" the sweeping windbreakers shielding the rear decks, tying to the curve of the funnel were removed. The ship was again painted all-white, with the top half of the funnel yellow and the bottom half blue, and a blue circle with the ship's name on it in the center of the funnel.
Interior design.
The "Finlandia"s original interiors were designed by famous artists and architects such as Jonas Cedecreutz, Lisa Johansson-Pape, Dora Jung, Harry Kivijärvi and Rut Bryk. The interior facilities included a swimming pool, sauna, nightclub, smoking room, cinema and hair salon, most of which were novelties for Finland Steamship Company ship on the Finland—West Germany run. The 647 passengers berths were divided between 254 first class berths and 393 tourist class berths. On conversion into the "Finnstar" the public spaces were rebuilt, the existing cabins replaced with more luxurious ones and new luxury cabins added on the upper level of the car deck. As a result the "Finnstar" carried 576 all-berth passengers. As the "Pearl of Scandinavia" the cabins were again upgraded, the remaining car deck eliminated and new penthouse suites added; as a result the ship had berths for 515 passengers.

Little Rock Nine

Little Rock Nine were a group of African American students enrolled in Little Rock Central High School in 1957. Their enrollment was followed by the Little Rock Crisis, in which the students were initially prevented from entering the racially segregated school by Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas. They then attended after the intervention of President Eisenhower.
The U.S. Supreme Court issued its historic "Brown v. Board of Education" of Topeka, Kansas, 347 U.S. 483, on May 17, 1954. The decision declared all laws establishing segregated schools to be unconstitutional, and it called for the desegregation of all schools throughout the nation. After the decision, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attempted to register black students in previously all-white schools in cities throughout the South. In Little Rock, the capital city of Arkansas, the Little Rock School Board agreed to comply with the high court's ruling. Virgil Blossom, the Superintendent of Schools, submitted a plan of gradual integration to the school board on May 24, 1955, which the board unanimously approved. The plan would be implemented during the fall of the 1957 school year, which would begin in September 1957. By 1957, the NAACP had registered nine black students to attend the previously all-white Little Rock Central High, selected on the criteria of excellent grades and attendance. The nicknamed "Little Rock Nine" consisted of Ernest Green (b. 1941), Elizabeth Eckford (b. 1941), Jefferson Thomas (1942–2010), Terrence Roberts (b. 1941), Carlotta Walls LaNier (b. 1942), Minnijean Brown (b. 1941), Gloria Ray Karlmark (b. 1942), Thelma Mothershed (b. 1940), and Melba Pattillo Beals (b. 1941). Ernest Green was the first African American to graduate from Central High School.
The Blossom Plan.
One of the plans created during attempts to desegregate the schools of Little Rock was by school superintendent Virgil Blossom. The initial approach proposed substantial integration beginning quickly and extending to all grades within a matter of many years. This original proposal was scrapped and replaced with one that more closely met a set of minimum standards worked out in attorney Richard B. McCulloch's brief. This finalized plan would start in September 1957 and would integrate one high school, Little Rock Central. The second phase of the plan would take place in 1960 and would open up a few junior high schools to a few black children. The final stage would involve limited desegregation of the city's grade schools at an unspecified time, possibly as late as 1963.
This plan was met with varied reactions from the NAACP branch of Little Rock. Militant members like the Bateses opposed the plan on the grounds that it was "vague, indefinite, slow-moving and indicative of an intent to stall further on public integration." Despite this view, the majority, most feeling that Blossom and the school board should have the chance to prove themselves, that the plan was reasonable, and that the white community would accept it, accepted the plan.
This view was short lived, however. Changes were made to the plan, the most detrimental being a new transfer system that would allow students to move out of the attendance zone to which they were assigned. The unaltered Blossom Plan had gerrymandered school districts to guarantee a black majority at Horace Mann High and a white majority at Hall High. This meant that, even though black students lived closer to Central, they would be placed in Horace Mann thus confirming the intention of the school board to limit the impact of desegregation. The altered plan gave white students the choice of not attending Horace Mann, but didn't give black students the option of attending Hall. This new Blossom Plan did not sit well with the NAACP and after failed negotiations with the school board; the NAACP filed a lawsuit on February 8, 1956.
This lawsuit, along with a number of other factors contributed to the Little Rock School Crisis of 1957.
National Guard blockade.
Several segregationist councils threatened to hold protests at Central High and physically block the black students from entering the school. Governor Orval Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to support the segregationists on September 4, 1957. The sight of a line of soldiers blocking out the students made national headlines and polarized the nation. Regarding the accompanying crowd, one of the nine students, Elizabeth Eckford, recalled:
On September 9, the Little Rock School District issued a statement condemning the governor's deployment of soldiers to the school, and called for a citywide prayer service on September 12. Even President Dwight Eisenhower attempted to de-escalate the situation by summoning Faubus for a meeting, warning him not to defy the Supreme Court's ruling.
Armed escort.
Woodrow Wilson Mann, the mayor of Little Rock, asked President Eisenhower to send federal troops to enforce integration and protect the nine students. On September 24, the President ordered the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army—without its black soldiers, who rejoined the division a month later—to Little Rock and federalized the entire 10,000-member Arkansas National Guard, taking it out of the hands of Faubus.
A tense year.
By the end of September 1957, the nine were admitted to Little Rock Central High under the protection of the U.S. Army (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, "Warriors Don't Cry", an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her alive by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.
Minnijean Brown was also taunted by members of a group of white male students in December 1957 in the school cafeteria during lunch. She dropped her lunch, a bowl of chili, onto the boys and was suspended for six days. Two months later, after more confrontation, Brown was suspended for the rest of the school year. She transferred to New Lincoln High School in New York City. As depicted in the 1981 made-for-TV docudrama "Crisis at Central High", and as mentioned by Melba Pattillo Beals in "Warriors Don't Cry", white students were punished only when their offense was "both egregious and witnessed by an adult". The drama was based on a book by Elizabeth Huckaby, a vice-principal during the crisis.
"The Lost Year".
In the summer of 1958, as the school year was drawing to a close, Faubus decided to petition the decision by the Federal District Court in order to postpone the desegregation of public high schools in Little Rock. In the "Cooper v. Aaron" case, the Little Rock School District, under the leadership of Faubus, fought for a two and a half year delay on de-segregation, which would have meant that black students would only be permitted into public high schools in January 1961. Faubus argued that if the schools remained integrated there would be an increase in violence. However, in August 1958, the Federal Courts ruled against the delay of de-segregation, which incited Faubus to call together an Extraordinary Session of the State Legislature on August 26 in order to enact his segregation bills.
Claiming that Little Rock had to assert their rights and freedom against the federal decision, in September 1958, Faubus signed acts that enabled him and the Little Rock School District to close all public schools. Thus, with this bill signed, on Monday September 15, Faubus ordered the closure of all four public high schools, preventing both black and white students from attending school. Despite Faubus's decree, the town's population had the chance of refuting the bill since the school-closing law necessitated a referendum. The referendum, which would either condone or condemn Faubus's law, was to take place within thirty days. A week before the referendum, which was scheduled to take place on September 27, Faubus addressed the citizens of Little Rock in an attempt to secure their votes. Faubus urged the population to vote against integration since he was planning on leasing the public school buildings to private schools, and, in doing so, would educate the white and black students separately. Faubus was successful in his appeal and won the referendum. This year came to be known as the "Lost Year."
Faubus's victory led to a series of consequences that affected the entire population of Little Rock. Faubus's intention to open private schools was denied the same day the referendum took place, which caused the citizens of Little Rock to turn on the black community. The black community became a target for hate crimes since people blamed them for the closing of the schools. Daisy Bates, head of the NAACP chapter in Little Rock, was a primary victim to these crimes, in addition to the black students enrolled at Little Rock Central High School and their families.
The town's teachers were also placed in a difficult position. They were forced to swear loyalty to Faubus's bills. Even though Faubus's idea of private schools never played out, the teachers were still expected to attend school every day and prepare for the possibility of their students' return. The teachers were completely under Faubus's control and the many months that the school stayed empty only served as a cause for uncertainty in their professional futures.
In May 1959, after the firing of forty-four teachers and administrative staff from the four high schools, three segregationist board members were replaced with three moderate ones. The new board members reinstated the forty-four staff members to their positions. The new board of directors then began an attempt to reopen the schools, much to Faubus's dismay. In order to avoid any further complications, the public high schools were scheduled to open earlier than usual, on August 12, 1959.
Although the Lost Year had come to a close, the black students who returned to the high schools were not welcomed by the other students. Rather, the black students had a difficult time getting past mobs to enter the school, and, once inside, they were often subject to physical and emotional abuse. The students were back at school and everything would eventually resume normal function, but the Lost Year would be a pretext for new hatred towards the black students in the public high school.
Motivations.
Faubus's opposition to desegregation was likely both politically and racially motivated. Although Faubus had indicated that he would consider bringing Arkansas into compliance with the high court's decision in 1956, desegregation was opposed by his own southern conservative Democratic Party, which dominated all Southern politics at the time. Faubus risked losing political support in the upcoming 1958 Democratic gubernatorial primary if he showed support for integration.
Most histories of the crisis conclude that Faubus, facing pressure as he campaigned for a third term, decided to appease racist elements in the state by calling out the National Guard to prevent the black students from entering Central High.
Harry Ashmore, the editor of the "Arkansas Gazette", won a 1958 Pulitzer Prize for his editorials on the crisis. Ashmore portrayed the fight over Central High as a crisis manufactured by Faubus; in his interpretation, Faubus used the Arkansas National Guard to keep black children out of Central High School because he was frustrated by the success his political opponents were having in using segregationist rhetoric to stir white voters.
Congressman Brooks Hays, who tried to mediate between the federal government and Faubus, was later defeated by a last minute write-in candidate, Dale Alford, a member of the Little Rock School Board who had the backing of Faubus's allies. A few years later, despite the incident with the "Little Rock Nine", Faubus ran as a moderate segregationist against Dale Alford, who was challenging Faubus for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1962.
Legacy.
Little Rock Central High School still functions as part of the Little Rock School District, and is now a National Historic Site that houses a Civil Rights Museum, administered in partnership with the National Park Service, to commemorate the events of 1957.
In 1958, Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén published "Little Rock", a bilingual composition in English and Spanish denouncing the racial segregation in the United States. In some verses, the writer used names referring the Little Rock events as qualifying adjectives.
Melba Pattillo Beals wrote a memoir titled "Warriors Don't Cry", published in the mid-1990s.
Two made-for-television movies have depicted the events of the crisis: the 1981 CBS movie "Crisis at Central High", and the 1993 Disney Channel movie "The Ernest Green Story".
In 1996, seven of the Little Rock Nine appeared on "The Oprah Winfrey Show". They came face to face with a few of the white students who had tormented them as well as one student who had befriended them.
President Bill Clinton honored the Little Rock Nine in November 1999 when he presented them each with a Congressional Gold Medal. The medal is the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress. It is given to those who have provided outstanding service to the country. To receive the Congressional Gold Medal, recipients must be co-sponsored by two-thirds of both the House and Senate.
In 2007, the United States Mint made available a commemorative silver dollar to "recognize and pay tribute to the strength, the determination and the courage displayed by African-American high school students in the fall of 1957." The obverse depicts students accompanied by a soldier, with nine stars symbolizing the Little Rock Nine. The reverse depicts an image of Little Rock Central High School, c. 1957. Proceeds from the coin sales are to be used to improve the National Historic Site.
On December 9, 2008, the Little Rock Nine were invited to attend the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama, the first African-American to be elected President of the United States.
On February 9, 2010, Marquette University honored the group by presenting them with the Père Marquette Discovery Award, the university's highest honor, one that had previously been given to Mother Teresa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Karl Rahner, and the Apollo 11 astronauts, among other notables.

Patriarch Evtimiy Square

Patriarch Evtimiy Square (, "ploshtad "Patriarh Evtimiy""), more popularly known as Popa (Попа, "The Priest"), is a small urban square and a busy intersection in the centre of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. The square was named after Evtimiy of Tarnovo, Patriarch of Bulgaria from 1375 to 1393 and one of the most important figures of medieval Bulgaria; a monument to Evtimiy by sculptor Marko Markov has adorned the square since 1939.
Patriarch Evtimiy Square is located at the crossing of the car-free Graf Ignatiev Street, Vasil Levski Boulevard and Patriarch Evtimiy Boulevard, which branches off Vasil Levski at the square. Due to its central location, between Sofia University and Orlov most to the east and the National Palace of Culture to the west, it is a very popular meeting point, particularly for teenagers and young adults. The square is well connected to many parts of Sofia through the nearby tramway, trolleybus and bus stops; many routed taxicabs of the marshrutka network also pass near the square.
The Odeon Cinema lies in the western part of the square and the Bulgartabac headquarters lie to the south of it. Other nearby landmarks include Slaveykov Square to the north along Graf Ignatiev Street and the Vasil Levski National Stadium to the southeast.

Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages

The southward movement of Germanic tribes during the migration period had left Pomerania largely depopulated by the 7th century. Between 650 and 850 AD, West Slavic tribes settled in Pomerania. The tribes between the Oder and the Vistula were collectively known as Pomeranians, and those west of the Oder as Veleti and later Lutici. A distinct Slavic tribe, the Rani, was based on the island of Rügen and the adjacted mainland. In the 8th and 9th centuries, Slavic-Scandinavian emporia were set up along the coastline as powerful centers of craft and trade.
In 936, the Holy Roman Empire set up the Billung and Northern marches in Western Pomerania, divided by the Peene river. The Liutician federation regain independence in an uprising of 983 but succumbed to internal conflicts and disintegrated in the course of the 11th century. In late 960s, Polish Piasts acquired parts of eastern Pomerania, where the short-lived Diocese of Kołobrzeg (Kolberg) was installed in 1000 AD. The Pomeranians regained independence during the Pomeranian uprising of 1005.
During the first half of the 11th century, the Liuticians participated in the Holy Roman Empire's wars against Piast Poland. The alliance broke off when Poland was defeated, and the Liutician federation broke apart in 1057 during a civil war. The Liutician capital was destroyed by the Germans in 1068/69, making way for the subsequent eastward expansion of their western neighbor, the Obodrite state. In 1093, the Luticians, Pomeranians and Rani had to pay tribute to Obodrite prince Henry.
The name "Pomerania" comes from Slavic po more, which means Land at the Sea.
Migration period.
The pattern of settlement in Pomerania started to change in the 3rd century. The prospering material cultures of the Roman Iron Age decayed. Only in some areas a continuity of these cultures is observed until the 5th and 6th centuries.
These changes are associated with the migration period, when Germanic tribes migrated towards the Roman Empire.
Slavic Pomeranians.
The 5th century marks the climax of an era that is characterized by a gap between the latest Germanic and the earliest Slavic archaeological findings in Pomerania, that researchers until today cannot explain sufficiently.
Origin debate.
The origins of the Slavic tribes in Pomerania are subject to an ongoing debate. One school of thought, particularly popular among German researchers, sees the origins of these Slavs east of the Vistula and postulates a westward migration from there during the 6th and 7th centuries. It does not explain, however, the enormous increase in both the inhabited area and the numbers of the settlers. The second school of thought, popular among Polish researchers, seeks to prove an archeological continuity from the cultures of the Roman Iron Age to the medieval Slavic culture. The third hypothesis postulates that parts of the Veneti were assimilated by the Germanic tribes while the rest became Slavs. No consensus on the subject has emerged.
First appearance of Slavic cultures.
The first appearance of Slavs in the area is still unclear and is related to the question of the general ethnogenesis of the Slavs. According to German historiography, Slavic immigration took place between 650 and 850 AD, reaching first the southern parts of the mainland, Usedom and Wollin in the late 8th century, and Rügen in the 9th century. On the other hand, Polish historiography has stressed linkages between Roman-era cultures and later, clearly Slavic, populations.
The first archeological records of Slavs in the Oder area are ceramics of the Sukow type dated back to the 6th or the beginning 7th century. The Sukow type is also known as Sukow-Szeligi group, Deez type, and Dziedzice type. These findings are associated with the first wave of immigrants from what is now Southwestern Poland. For some areas, continuous settlement from the Roman to the Slavic era is suggested on the basis of analyses of pollen name transitions. Farther Pomerania and Pomerelia appear to have been unsettled in this period. Archeological research in Pomerelia is less extensive than that of Farther Pomerania. It has been previously suggested that subsequent appearances of new material cultures were due to other waves of immigration, but it is presently interpreted as a mere technology transfer not involving mass migration.
Slavic Feldberg type ceramics, found in a region comprising the Oder area up to the Persante (Parseta) river, as well as Mecklenburg and Brandenburg, are dated back to the 7th and 8th century. Feldberg ceramics dominate west of the Oder since the mid-8th century, except for Northwestern Pomerania. This ceramic type is associated by some researchers with subsequent waves of migration from Silesia, Bohemia and Lesser Poland.
The Bavarian Geographer's anonymous medieval document, compiled in 830 in Regensburg, contains a list of the tribes in Central-Eastern Europe east of the Elbe. It mentions among others the Uuilci (Veleti) with 95 civitas, the Nortabtrezi (Obotrites) with 53 civitas, the Milzane (Milceni) with 30 civitas, and the Hehfeldi (Hevelli) with 14 civitas.
Pomerelia has also been settled by Slavs in the 7th and 8th century. Based on archeological and linguistic findings, two hypotheses have been put forth: one posits that these settlers moved northward along the Vistula river, and another views them as the Veleti moving westward from the Vistula delta.
Slavic settlement extended to Western Pomerania in the 9th century and possibly as early as the 8th century. Dense Slavic settlement before the 9th century is especially unlikely for the northern areas, where findings of Feldberg ceramics are very rare. Freesendorf ceramics however, which became popular in the course of the 9th century, are found abundantly in northwestern Pomerania, too.
Soon after the Slavic settlement, Gords fortified with walls of wood and clay were built. One of the oldest "gards" is the stronghold of Dragovit, king of the Veleti, that was targeted by an expedition led by Charlemagne in 789 and is thought to be at modern "Vorwerk" near Demmin. The Slavs modeled their burghs and armament following West Central European standards, yet in the 8th and 9th century, the density of burghs in Mecklenburg and Pomerania became exceptionally high compared with other territories.
Tribal and territorial organization.
By the 9th to 11th century the region was recorded as inhabited by various tribes belonging to the Lechitic group of the West Slavs. The small tribes dwelling west of the Oder river were known collectively as "Veleti" (Wilzi), since the late 10th century as "Lutici" (Lutici), the tribes further east as "Pomeranians". Another distinct tribe, the Rani, lived on the island of Rügen and the adjacted mainland. These tribes spoke Polabian (Veleti, Rani) and closely related Pomeranian (Pomeranians) dialects. A Frankish document titled "Bavarian Geographer" (ca 845) mentions the tribes of Volinians ("Velunzani"), Pyritzans ("Prissani"), Ukrani ("Ukri") and Veleti ("Wiltzi") around the lower Oder.
From the 9th to the 11th century, at least ten Pomeranian tribes dwelled between the Oder and Vistula river. They are not known by name except for the Volinians and Pyritzans. It is not known if these tribes ever formed any kind of a tribal union. It is also possible that on the two sides of the river, the tribes were split from the beginning into eastern and western Pomeranian groups, with the latter possibly related to the Veleti.
The settlements of the distinct tribes were separated from each other and from their neighbors by vast woodlands. In 1124, it took Otto of Bamberg three days to cross the woods separating the Pomeranians from the neighboring Poles.
Among the various Pomeranian tribes, the territory of the Volinians was the smallest, but also the most densely settled, with about one settlement for every four square kilometers, around 1000 AD. In contrast, the other tribe explicitly mentioned in contemporary chronicles, was that of the Pyritzans, who inhabited the area around Pyritz and Stargard but whose settlements numbered roughly only one for every twenty kilometers. The center of the Volinian territory was a town located at the site of the modern town of Wolin (Wollin) on Wolin (Wollin) island. Russian, Saxon, and Scandinavian merchants lived in the town.
The Lutici tribes in 983 formed the Liutizian federation, comprising the Circipanes, Kessinians, Redarians, and Tollensians, probably also the Hevelli and Rani. The Volinians also played an important role. They were at various times both ally and military target of the Holy Roman Empire and Poland. The federation declined in the 1050s due to internal struggles ("see below").
There are sparse records of dukes in this area, but no records about the extension of their duchies or any dynastic relations. The first written record of any local Pomeranian ruler is the 1046 mention of Zemuzil (in Polish literature also called "Siemomysł") at an imperial meeting. A "dux Pomorie" is recorded for the year 997 in a 13th-century vitae of Adalbert of Prague, most probably seated in Gdańsk (Danzig). Another chronicle written in 1113 by Gallus Anonymus mentions several dukes of Pomerania: Swantibor, Gniewomir, and an unnamed duke besieged in Kołobrzeg. A mention of a battle between the Pomeranians, Poles and Hungarians in the Gesta Hunganorum, taken as historical by earlier historians, has been identified as medieval folklore, since the author Simon de Keza mixed up historical events with legends. This 13th-century chronicle reports that the later Hungarian king Bela I had fled to Mieszko II of Poland (mistaken for Casimir I), and defeated a Pomeranian duke ("Pomoranie ducem") in a duel. The Annals of Pegau ("Annales Pegaviensis"), written in 1150, mention a Wilk de Posduwc (Wolf of Pasewalk) as one of the grandfathers of the founder of Pegau Abbey and later margrave of Meissen, Wiprecht von Groitzsch, born 1050. The annals say that Wilk held a "Pomeranorum primatum". Since the oldest parts of these annals are regarded to resemble "legendary tales", it is uncertain whether Wilk is a historical or legendary figure. Pomeranian historian Adolf Hofmeister proposed that the record might nevertheless have a grain of truth in it, but in this case sees Wilk not as a universal ruler of Pomerania, but as a local or subordinate prince.
Languages.
The western Slavs included the ancestors of the peoples know later Poles, Pomeranians, Czechs, Slovaks and Polabians. The northern so-called Lechitic group includes, along with Polish, the dead Polabian and Pomeranian languages. The languages of the southern part of the Polabian area, preserved as relics today in Upper and Lower Lusatia, occupy a place between the Lechitic and Czecho-Slovak groups.
According to The Encyclopædia Britannica:
Religion.
In the Middle Ages, Pomeranians, Liutizians and Rani worshied gods of the Slavic mythology:
Among oracles were horse oracles in Szczecin and Arkona.
Major temple sites were:
Scandinavian settlements and emporia.
Viking Age Scandinavian settlements were set up along the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, primarily for trade purposes. Their appearance coincides with the settlement and consolidation of the Slavic tribes in the respective areas. Scandinavians had contacts to the Slavs since their very immigration, these first contacts were soon followed by both the construction of Scandinavian emporia and Slavic burghs in their vicinity.
The Scandinavian settlements were larger than the early Slavic ones, their craftsmen had a considerably higher productivity, and in contrast to the early Slavs, the Scandinavians were capable of seafaring. It is not known whether or not the emporia were somehow integrated into the emerging tribal organizations of the Slavs, yet it is taken for certain that they were very important centers of power.
Their importance for trade with the Slavic world however was limited to the coastal regions and their hinterlands - while imported goods associated with Scandinavian trade have been found in the areas between Baltic coast, Mecklenburg Lake District and Pomeranian lake chain, evidence for contacts to distant Slavic areas further south is missing.
Scandinavian settlements at the Pomeranian coast include Wollin (on the isle of Wollin), Ralswiek (on the isle of Rügen), Altes Lager Menzlin (at the lower Peene river), and Bardy-Świelubie near modern Kołobrzeg. Menzlin was set up in the mid-8th century. In Wollin, seaside foritifications have been dated back to the beginning 10th century, yet remnants of older fortifications were also found, probably pointing to an earlier burgh with an adjacent open settlement. Wollin and Ralswiek began to prosper in the course of the 9th century.
Bardy-Świelubie differs from other emporia: The location is rather far from the coastline, and Bardy was built before 800, making it one of the earliest Slavic burghs in the coastal area. Archaeological findings indicate participation in Carolingian trade, but evidence of non-Slavic presence is missing. In the 9th century, Scandinavians (men and women) settled the site, as is evident from the adjacent Hügelgrab grave field in Świelubie. The exact site of the settlement, whether inside or close to the burgh, is not yet determined. A Slavic burgh as a predecessor for a Scandinavian settlement is not observed elsewhere, with the possible, but not yet evident exception of Wollin.
A merchants' settlement has also been suggested near Arkona, but no archeological evidence supports this theory. Reric, formerly located at Rerik on the Fischland-Darß-Zingst peninsula in Western Pomerania, has recently been identified as Groß Strömkendorf on the eastern coast of Wismar Bay in Mecklenburg. Reric was set up around the year 700, but following later warfare between Obodrites and Danes, the merchants were resettled to Haithabu.
The exact ethnic composition of the settlements cannot be determined, it is thought that they had a multi-ethnic character - besides Scandinavians, a Slavic and Frisian presence has been suggested. Scandinavian presence is evident in artefacts, burial rites, and the type of houses.
Early emporia like Menzlin and Dierkow (just west of the Pomeranian border, near Rostock) reached their peak already in the 9th century, no imported goods are found from the 10th century. Bardy-Świelubie was vacated in the late 9th century, when the Slavic settlement of Kołobrzeg became the new center of the region. Ralswiek made it into the new millennium, but at the time when written chronicles reported the site in the 12th century it had lost all its importance. Wollin was destroyed by the Danes in the 12th century.
Scandinavian arrowheads from the 8th and 9th centuries were found between the coast and the lake chains in the Mecklenburgian and Pomeranian hinterlands, pointing at periods of warfare between the Scandinavians and Slavs.
Jomsvikings.
Jomsborg (Jomsburg) was the name given by several medieval Scandinavian sources to a stronghold on the Pomeranian coast. It was set up by Danish king Harald Bluetooth and Styrbjörn in the course of Harald's internal struggles with his son, Sweyn Forkbeard, in the 970s or 980s, and housed a garrison of soldiers known as Jomsvikings. Jomsborg is believed today to be identical with Vineta, Jumne and Wollin. Harald is reported to have died in Jomsborg after he was wounded trying to regain his power with a Jomsviking and Norman fleet. Sweyn was captured by the Jomsvikings and held hostage in Jomsborg, until a peace was negotiated and Sweyn as well as Harald's body were sent back to Denmark.
Trade, robbery, and piracy.
Scandinavian emporia and major Slavic burghs were set up primarily at junctions of long-distance trade routes. Such trade routes ran along the Vistula river, reaching the coast at Truso and Gdańsk; along the western bank of the Oder, coming from the Danube area and Moravia and forking north of Schwedt with the eastern fork running through Szczecin and reaching the sea at Wollin, while the western fork ran through Menzlin and reached the sea at Wolgast and Usedom. Routes from Prague and the western parts of the Holy Roman Empire met at Magdeburg, which in turn was connected to Mecklenburg and Reric by a northern route, with Demmin and Menzlin by a northeastern route, and with the Oder route by an eastern route running through the Uckermark. Another trade route connected Mecklenburg and Reric with Usedom and Wollin, running through Werle, Lüchow, Dargun, Demmin and Menzlin.
From the coastal emporia, these routes were connected to sea trade routes of the Baltic Sea. Vessels build for seafaring were also able to navigate in the lower Recknitz river, Peenestrom and lower Peene river up to Demmin, and Oder river up to Silesia. Already in the 9th century, wooden and waterproof containers were in use that were easy to transport by carriage as well as by ship.
Trade, robbery, and piracy did not exclude each other, but were then two sides of the same coin. Whether one traded or stole depended on one's own military strength or protection compared to the abilities of the encountered party. Slavic piracy, especially from Rügen and Wollin, climaxed in the 11th century. Denmark, being the major target, launched several expeditions to stop this piracy, such as an expedition directed at Wollin and the Oder estituary led by king Magnus in 1043, and several expeditions initiated by Eric Ejegod, father of Canute Lavard, in the late 11th century.
Major trade items were livestock, especially horses; wheat, honey, wax, and salt; grind and millstones; jewelry and luxury articles like pearls and items made from glass, semi-precious stones, gold, silver and amber; weapons, and slaves. Acquisition of loot and capture of people for slave trade were primary war aims in the many campaigns and expeditions of the Slavic tribes and invaders from outside Pomerania. Also, merchants' caravans did not only engage in slave trade, but also captured people to sell them as slaves.
If not exchanging goods with an equal value, one used linen, iron and silver for payment. Iron was cast to non-functional daggers, spades, and axes, while silver was either used minted to coins, or as chopped silver items (including jewelry and coins). Before 950, silver coins originated primarily in Arabia, after 950 these were used together with western European coins, which since the late 10th century largely replaced the Arabic ones. Also, coins minted in Haithabu were abundantly used in the western regions of Pomerania up to the lower Oder region.
Billung and Northern marches (936-983).
In 936, the area west of the Oder River was incorporated in the March of the Billungs (north of the Peene River) and the Northern March (south of the Peene River) of the Holy Roman Empire. The respective bishoprics were the Diocese of Hamburg-Bremen and Diocese of Magdeburg. In the Battle of Recknitz ("Raxa") in 955, German and Rani forces commanded by Otto I of Germany suppressed an Obodrite revolt in the Billung march, instigated by Wichmann the Younger and his brother Egbert the One-Eyed In 983, the area regained independence in an uprising initiated by the Liutizian federation. The margraves and bishops upheld their claims, but were not able to reinforce them despite various expeditions. A similar pagan reaction in Denmark between 976 and 986, initiated by Sven Forkbeard, forced his father Harald Bluetooth to exile to Wollin.
Polish gains and formation of the Diocese of Kołobrzeg.
The first Polish duke Mieszko I invaded Pomerania and acquired the town of Kołobrzeg and the adjacent areas in the 960s. He also fought the Volinians, but despite a won battle in 967, he did not succeed in expanding his Pomeranian gains. His son and successor Boleslaw I continued to campaign in Pomerania, but also failed to subdue the Volinians and the lower Oder areas.
During the Congress of Gniezno in 1000 AD, Boleslaw created the first, yet short-lived bishopric in Pomerania Diocese of Kolobrzeg (Kolberg), subordinate to the Archdiocese of Gniezno, headed by Saxon bishop Reinbern, which was destroyed when Pomeranians revolted in 1005. Of all Liutizians, the Volinians were especially devoted to participation in the wars between the Holy Roman Empire and Poland from 1002 to 1018 to prevent Boleslaw I from reinstating his rule in Pomerania.
German-Lutician alliance.
In the aftermath of the uprising of 983, Holy Roman Emperor Otto III sought to reinstate his marches and upheld good relations with Piast Poland, which was to be integrated in a reorganized empire (""renovatio imperii Romanorum""). These plans, reaching a climax with the Congress of Gniezno in 1000 AD, were thwarted by Otto's death in 1002, the subsequent rapid expansion of the Piast realm, and the resulting change in Polish politics. After conquering Bohemia, parts of Hungary and Kiev, Boleslaw I of Poland refused to give his oath to Otto's successor, Henry II, and instead allied with German dukes and margraves opposing Henry. Thus, Henry, for a tribute, offered an alliance to the Luticians when he met with their representatives at a Hoftag in Merseburg on March 28, 1003.
Parts of the German clergy and nobility however did not approve this alliance, because it thwarted their ambitions to reintegrate the Lutician territories in their marches and bishoprics. Among those who disapproved was Thietmar of Merseburg, a contemporary chronicler whom we own the reports of the subsequent events. During the expedition to Poland in 1005, the Christian German army was "shocked" when the pagan Luticians showed up carrying their idols with them. Many of the nobles now ordered by Henry to fight Boleslaw were just years before involved with the German-Polish alliance by fighting the Luticians and arranging marriages with the House of Piast. In another expedition in 1017, when Hermann Billung commanded an army comprising several Lutician units, one of Billung's men threw a rock at an idol of a Lutician goddess, with the consequence that Henry had to pay the Luticians twelve punds of silver. Boleslaw on the other hand prepared an anti-Lutician alliance which he termed "brotherhood in Christo", but at the same time tried to bribe the Luticians and have them carry out attacks on the empire. In 1007, Luticians reported a bribery case to Henry, while in 1010, Hevellian renegades were caught by Henry's troops, indicating that the German and Polish offers at least to some degree divided the Luticians.
In 1012, the German-Lutician alliance of 1003 was renewed in Amberg. In 1017, after an idol of a Lutician goddess got lost when German and Lutician units crossed the Mulde river during a flood, the Luticians left the expeditions and held an assembly on whether or not continue the alliance after this omen - though they eventually decided in favor of the alliance, an inner division of the Luticians in this case was evident again.
The alliance broke off, when Henry's successor, Konrad II managed to subdue Poland, then led by Boleslaw's successor, Mieszko II. Starting in 1129, several imperial campaigns with Danish and Kievian participation resulted in the Peace of Merseburg, concluded in 1033. With the Polish threat, the primary precondition for the German-Lutician alliance was thus eliminated, and hostilities started the same year.
Lutician decline and Obodrite expansion.
In 1056/57, the Lutician federation fell apart during a civil war (""Lutizischer Bruderkrieg""). The expanding Obodrite state, then led by Gottschalk and supported by Danish Sven Estridson, Gottschalk's father-in-law, and Saxon duke Bernhard II, engaged in the Lutician war and incorporated the Kessinian territory and Circipania in 1057. While the Obodrite state was temporarily weakened by a revolt in 1066 that cost Gottschalk's life, Burchard I, bishop of Halberstadt invaded the Lutician area in the winter of 1067/68, raided their capital Rethra, captured the holy steed, Rethra's most important Svarozic oracle, and rode it to Halberstadt. In the winter of 1069, Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor again raided and looted the area.
However, inner quarrels hindered the empire to pursue further conquests, and in 1073, Henry IV as well as his Saxon opponents offered alliances to the Luticians outbidding each other with favourable conditions and benefits. As a result, the Luticians allied with neither party, but instead started another civil war over which alliance they should conclude. In addition, Boleslaw II of Poland also canvassed the Luticians for joining an anti-German coalition with Denmark. As a consequence, Lutician military power was completely exhausted in the course of the 11th century. In 1093, Helmold of Bosau reported that among others the Luticians, Pomeranians and Rani had to pay tribute to Obodrite prince Henry.

Historical demography of Pomerania

Pomerania has experienced several transitions not only of culture and administration, but also of its population.
The first historically noted major change occurred in the midst of the first millennium, when large parts of the indigenous population left Pomerania. Earlier West Baltic Prussian tribes, who lived west of the Vistula river and had moved to east of the river moved back to their old settlements west of the Vistula.
In 997 AD a large number of Old Prussians were baptized by Adalbert of Prague in the Vistula Delta. By that time Slavs had moved up north and the territory became known as Pomerania by 1046 AD. 
The second major transition of most of the Pomeranian tribes was from Slavic to German in the 14th century. At the end of the first millennium, Piast Poland incorporated whole of Pomerania into its state. Afterwards, in the beginning of the second millennium, Denmark and the German Holy Roman Empire started to incorporate pagan Pomeranian territories into their expanding feudal states. Most Slavic Pomeranian tribes west of the Oder had lost their independence in late 12th century. In the course of the 14th and 15th century, German settlement in the Duchy of Pomerania increased. Where Slavic population was left, they were called "Wends", "Kashubians" or "Slovincians" to distinguish them from the German Pomeranians. Whereas through later history the Kashubs were only minority in the Eastern Duchy of Pomerania, their numbers were notably higher in Pomerelia as well as the numbers of Germans were significantly lower there either. Pomerenian history was, from that time, closely tied to the history of Germany, Denmark and Sweden, whereas Pomerelian history was also until 1308 and between 1466 and 1772 closely tied to Poland.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Thirty Years' War and the Nordic Wars had a severe impact on all of Germany including the Pomeranian population. More than half died, lots of villages were completely wiped out. After this enormous population drop, new settlers were called in from less devastated German territories. Yet, not all villages were repopulated, so today's density of communities is not as high as back in the Middle Ages.
The third major change of Pomeranian population happened in the course of World War II and its aftermath. In Nazi Germany, Jews and many members of the Polish minority were murdered. Due to the advance of the Red Army and the territorial changes after the war, nearly all Germans populating post-war Poland that survived the war and failed to evacuate in 1945 were expelled to post-war Germany 1945-1947. The major, now Polish part of Pomerania was resettled mostly with Poles, in part expellees from the former eastern territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

Pomerania during the High Middle Ages

Pomerania during the High Middle Ages covers the History of Pomerania in the 12th and 13th centuries.
The early 12th century Obodrite, Polish, Saxon, and Danish conquests resulted in vassalage and Christianization of the formerly pagan and independent Pomeranian tribes. Local dynasties ruled the Principality of Rügen (House of Wizlaw), the Duchy of Pomerania (House of Pomerania, "Griffins"), the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp (Ratiboride branch of the Griffins), and the duchies in Pomerelia (Samborides).
The dukes of Pomerania expanded their realm into Circipania and Uckermark to the southwest, and competed with the Kingdom of Poland and the Margraviate of Brandenburg for territory and formal overlordship over their duchies. Pomerania-Demmin lost most of its territory and was integrated into Pomerania-Stettin in the mid-13th century. When the Ratiborides died out in 1223, competition arose for the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp, which changed hands numerous times.
Starting in the High Middle Ages, a large influx of German settlers and the introduction of German law, custom, and Low German language began the process of Germanisation (Ostsiedlung). Many of the people groups that had dominated the area during the Early Middle Ages, such as the Slavic Rani, Lutician and Pomeranian tribes, were assimilated into the new German Pomeranian culture. The Germanisation was not complete, as the Kashubians, descendants of Slavic Pomeranians, dominated many rural areas in Pomerelia. The arrival of German colonists and Germanization mostly affected both the central and local administration.
The conversion of Pomerania to Christianity was achieved primarily by the missionary efforts of Absalon and Otto von Bamberg, by the foundation of numerous monasteries, and through the Christian clergy and settlers. A Pomeranian diocese was set up in Wolin, the see was later moved to Cammin (Kammin, Kamień Pomorski).
Obodrite realm (1093-1128).
After the decline of the Lutician federation and the subsequent expansion of the Obodrite realm into former Lutician areas, and following the victory of Obodrite prince Henry in the Battle of Schmilau in 1093, Helmold of Bosau reported that among others the Luticians, Pomeranians and Rani had to pay tribute to Obodrite prince Henry. The Rani however launched a naval expedition in 1100, in the course of which they sieged Liubice, a predecessor of modern Lübeck and then the Obodrite capitol. This attack was however repulsed, and the Rani became tributary again. After they had killed Henry's son Woldemar and stopped paying tribute, Henry retaliated with two expeditions launched in the winters of 1123/24 and 1124/25, supported by Wendish and Saxon troops. The Rani Svantevit priests were forced to negotiate, and the island was spared only in return for an immense sum which had to be collected from the continental Slavs further east. At this time, Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania, was already expanding his realm into Liutician territories south of the Rani. Regrouping after Henry's death (1127), the Rani again assaulted and this time destroyed Liubice in 1128, ending Obodrite influence in the Pomeranian territories.
As part of Polish realm (1102/22–1138).
In several expeditions mounted between 1102 and 1121, most of Pomerania had been acquired by the Polish duke Bolesław III Wrymouth.
From 1102 to 1109, Boleslaw campaigned in the Noteć (Netze) and Parsęta (Persante) area. The Pomeranian residence in Białogard (Belgard) was taken already in 1102. From 1112 to 1116, Boleslaw took all of Pomerelia. From 1119 to 1122, the area towards the Oder was acquired. Szczecin (Stettin) was taken in the winter of 1121/1122.
The conquest resulted in a high death toll and devastation of vast areas of Pomerania, and the Pomeranian dukes became vassals of Boleslaw III of Poland. Deportations of Pomeranians to Poland took place. The terms of surrender after the Polish conquest were that Wartislaw had to accept Polish sovereignty, convert his people to Christianity, and pay an annual tribute to the Polish duke.
Emergence of Pomeranian dynasties - Samborides and Griffins.
Pomerelia, initially under Polish control, was ruled by the Samborides dynasty from 1227 until 1294. The duchy was split temporarily into districts of Gdańsk (Danzig), Białogard, Świecie (Schwetz) and Lubieszewo–Tczew .
In Pomerania proper, Polish rule ended with Boleslaw III's death in 1138. The Słupsk and Sławno areas (Lands of Schlawe and Stolp were ruled by Ratibor I and his descendants ("Ratiboriden" branch of the Griffin House of Pomerania) until the Danish occupation and extinction of the Ratiboride branch in 1227.
The areas stretching from Kołobrzeg to Szczecin were ruled by Ratibor's brother Wartislaw I and his descendants (House of Pomerania, also called "Griffins", of which he was the first ascertained ancestor) until the 1630s.
Conversion of Pomerania.
The first attempt to convert the Pomeranians to Christianity following the acquisition of Pomerania by Boleslaw III of Poland was made in 1122. The Spanish monk Bernard (also Bernhard) travelled to Jumne (Wolin), accompagnied only by his chaplain and an interpreter. The Pomeranians however were not impressed by his missionary efforts and finally threw him out of town. Bernard was later made bishop of Lebus.
After Bernard's misfortune, Boleslaw III asked Otto of Bamberg to convert Pomerania to Christianity, which he accomplished in his first visit in 1124/25. Otto's strategy severely differed from the one Bernard used: While Bernard travelled alone and as a poor and unknown priest, Otto, a wealthy and famous man, was accompanied by 20 clergy of his own diocese, numerous servants, 60 warriors supplied to him by Boleslaw, and carried with him numerous supplies and gifts. After arriving in Pyritz (Pyrzyce), the Pomeranians were assured that Otto's aim was not the gain of wealth at the expense of the Pomeranian people, as he was wealthy already, but only to convert them to Christianity, which would protect the Pomeranians from further punishment by God, as which the devastating Polish conquest was depicted. This approach turned out to be successful, and was backed by parts of the Pomeranian nobility that in part was Christian raised already, like duke Wartislaw, who encouraged and promoted Otto's mission. Many Pomeranians were baptized already in Pyritz and also in the other burghs visited.
At this first mission, Otto founded at least eleven churches, two of those each in Szczecin and Wolin.
Otto of Bamberg returned in 1128, this time invited by duke Wartislaw himself, aided by the emperor Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III, to convert the Slavs of Western Pomerania just incorporated into the Pomeranian duchy, and to strengthen the Christian faith of the inhabitants of Szczecin and Wolin, who fell back into heathen practices and idolatry. Otto this time visited primarily Western Pomeranian burghs, had the temples of Gützkow and Wolgast torn down and on their sites erected the predecessors of today's "St Nikolai" and "St Petri" churches, respectively, before turning to Kamień Pomorski, Wolin and Szczecin. The nobility assembled to a congress in Usedom, where they accepted Christianity on June 10, 1128. Otto then was titled "apostolus gentis Pomeranorum", made a saint by pope Clement III in 1189, and was worshiped in Pomerania even after the Protestant Reformation.
Holy Roman Emperor Lothair claimed the areas west of the Oder for his empire. Thus the terms of Otto's second mission were not negotiated with Boleslaw III of Poland, but with Lothar and Wartislaw. However Lothair terminated the mission in the fall of 1128, probably because he distrusted Otto's contacts with Boleslaw. Otto visited Gniezno on his way back to Bamberg.
Adalbert of Pomerania, the later Pomeranian bishop, participated in Otto's mission as an interpreter and assistant.
Fate of the pagan priesthood 
The priests of the numerous gods worshipped before the conversion were one of the most powerful class in the early medieval society. Their reaction to the Christianization of Pomerania was ambiguous: In 1122, they saved missionary Bernhard's life by declaring him insane, otherwise he would have been killed in Wolin. On the other hand, Otto of Bamberg's mission was a far larger threat to the established pagan tradition, and eventually it succeeded in Christianization of the region. There are reports of unsuccessful assassination attempts made against Otto of Bamberg by the pagan priesthood. Following Otto's success, some of the pagan priests were crucified, while it is unknown what happened to the others. It has been speculated that they adapted to the new reality.
Pomeranian diocese (1140).
On Otto of Bamberg's behalf, a diocese was founded with the see in Wollin ("Julin", "Jumne", "Vineta"), a major Slavic and Viking town in the Oder estituary. On October 14, 1140, Adalbert of Pomerania was made the first Bishop by Pope Innocent II. Otto however had died the year before. There was a rivalry between Otto's Diocese of Bamberg, the Diocese of Magdeburg and the Diocese of Gniezno for the incorporation of Pomerania. Pope Innocence II solved the dispute by repelling their claims and placed the new diocese directly under his Holy See. The see of the diocese was the church of "St Adalbert" in Wollin. The diocese had no clear-cut borders in the beginning, but roughly reached from the Tribsees burgh in the West to the Łeba River in the East. In the South, it comprised the northern parts of Uckermark and Neumark. As such, it was shaped after the territory held by Ratibor I, Duke of Pomerania.
After ongoing Danish raids, Wollin was destroyed, and the see of the diocese was shifted across the Dziwna to Kamień Pomorski's "St John's" church in 1176. This was confirmed by the pope in 1186. In the early 13th century, the Cammin diocese along with the Pomeranian dukes gained control over Circipania. Also, the bishops managed to gain direct control over a territory around Kolobrzeg and Koszalin.
The Pomerelian areas were integrated into the Kuyavian Diocese of Włocławek.
After the successful conversion of the nobility, monasteries were set up on vast areas granted by local dukes both to further implement Christian faith and to develop the land. The monasteries actively took part in the Ostsiedlung. Most of the clergy originated in Germany, some in Poland, and since the mid-12th century also from Denmark.
Wendish Crusade (1147).
In 1147, the Wendish Crusade, a campaign of the Northern Crusades, was mounted by bishops and nobles of the Holy Roman Empire and Poland. The crusaders ravaged the land and laid siege to Demmin and Stettin despite them (officially) being already Christian. Wollin's bishop Adalbert took part in the negotiations that finally led to the lifting of the Stettin siege by the crusaders. Ratibor I, Duke of Pomerania, went to the Imperial Diet in Havelberg the following year, where he swore to be a Christian.
Partition of 1155 - Pomerania-Demmin and Pomerania-Stettin.
Wartislaw I died between 1134 and 1148. His brother Ratibor I, duke in the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp, ruled in place of Wartislaw's sons, Bogislaw I and Casimir I until his death in about 1155. Then the duchy was split into Pomerania-Demmin, ruled by Casimir, including the upper Peene, Tollense, Dievenow and Rega areas, and Pomerania-Stettin, ruled by Bogislaw, including the lower Peene, Uecker, Oder, and Ihna areas. The Kolberg area was ruled in common as a codominion.
Westward expansion of Wartislaw I.
In the meantime, Wartislaw managed to conquer territories west of the Oder river, an area inhabited by Lutici tribes weakened by past warfare, and included these territories into his "Duchy of Pomerania". Already in 1120, he had expanded west into the areas near the Oder Lagoon and Peene river. Most notably Demmin, the Principality of Gützkow and Wolgast were conquered in the following years.
The major stage of the westward expansion into Lutici territory occurred between Otto of Bamberg's two missions, 1124 and 1128. In 1128, Demmin, the County of Gützkow and Wolgast were already incorporated into Wartislaw I's realm, yet warfare was still going on. Captured Lutici and other war loot, including livestock, money, and clothes were apportioned among the victorious. After Wartislaw's Lutician conquests, his duchy lay between the Bay of Greifswald to the north, Circipania, including Güstrow, to the west, Kolberg/Kołobrzeg in the east, and possibly as far as the Havel and Spree rivers in the south.
After the conquests, Wartislaw's realm stretched from the Bay of Greifswald in the North and Circipania with Güstrow in the West to the Havel and possibly also the Spree rivers in the South and the Kolobrzeg area in the east.
These gains were not subject to Polish over lordship, but were placed under over lordship of Nordmark margrave Albert the Bear, who according to Bialecki was a dedicated enemy of Slavs, by Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor. Thus, the western territories contributed to making Wartislaw significantly independent from the Polish dukes. Wartislaw was not the only one campaigning in these areas. The Polish duke Boleslaw III, during his Pomeranian campaign launched an expedition into the Müritz area in 1120/21, before he turned back to subdue Wartislaw. The later Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III (then Saxon duke Lothair I of Supplinburg) in 1114 initiated large scale campaigns against the local Lutici tribes resulting in their final defeat in 1228. Also, the territories were invaded by Danish forces multiple times, who, coming from the Baltic Sea, used the rivers Peene and Uecker to advance to a line Demmin–Pasewalk. At different times, Pomeranians, Saxons and Danes were either allies or opponents. The Pomeranian dukes consolidated their power in the course of the 12th century, yet the preceding warfare had left these territories completely devastated.
Society under Wartislaw I.
During Wartislaw I's rule society was composed of the Pomeranian freeman and the slaves, who consisted mostly of Wendish, German or Danish war captives. The freemen generally made their living from agriculture, fishing and husbandry, as well as hunting and trade. Their social status depended both on accumulated wealth as well as noble status. The proportion of slaves in the total population of the area was relatively small and in fact the Pomeranians exported slaves to Poland.
The largest settlements were Wollin (Wolin) and Stettin (Szczecin), each of which had a few thousand inhabitants, and a biweekly market day. While some historians address these settlements as towns, this is rejected by others due to the differences to later towns. They are usually referred to as early towns, proto-towns, castle towns or emporia; their Slavic designation was "*grod" (gard in Pomeranian and Polabian language). The population of Pomerania was relatively wealthy in comparison to her neighbors, owing to abundant land, inter-regional trade and piracy.
Wartislaw's power and standing differed depending on the area. In the east of his duchy (Cammin, Belgard, and Kolberg area) his power was strongest, tribal assemblies are not documented. In the center (Wolin, Szczecin, and Pyrzyce area) Wartislaw had to yield the decisions of the local population and nobility. In the towns, Wartislaw maintained small courts. Every decision of Wartislaw had to pass an assembly of the elders and an assembly of the free. In the newly gained Lutici territories of the West, Wartislaw managed to establish a rule that resembled his rule in the eastern parts, but also negotiated with the nobility.
Pomeranian expeditions to Scandinavia.
In 1134, Pomeranian troops invaded Denmark and even looted Roskilde, then the Danish capital. In 1135, Norwegian Konghelle was attacked and sacked.
Saxon conquest (1164).
In the West, bishops and dukes of the Holy Roman Empire mounted expeditions to Pomerania. Most notable for the further fate of Pomerania are the 1147 Wendish Crusade and the 1164 Battle of Verchen, the Pomeranian dukes became vassals of Henry the Lion, of Saxony. Circipania came under control of the Pomeranian dukes at about this time. Despite this vassalage, Henry again sieged Demmin in 1177 when he allied with the Danes, but reconciled with the Pomeranian dukes thereafter.
Holy Roman Empire (1181).
After the 1147 Wendish crusade and the 1164 Battle of Verchen, the duchy (at least the western parts) had joined Henry the Lion's Duchy of Saxony. Following internal struggles, Henry fell against Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1181. Bogislaw I took his duchy as a fief directly from Barbarossa in the same year.
At that time, the duchy was also referred to as Slavinia () (yet this was a term applied to several Wendish areas such as Mecklenburg and the Principality of Rügen). The duchy remained in the Empire, although Denmark managed to take control of the southern Baltic including the Duchy of Pomerania from the 1180s until the 1227 Battle of Bornhöved.
Danish conquests (1168–1185).
From the North, Denmark attacked Pomerania. Several campaigns throughout the 12th century (in 1136, 1150, 1159 and throughout the 1160s) culminated in the defeat of the Principality of Rugia in 1168.
Conquest and conversion of the Rugian principality (1168).
The island of Rügen and the surrounding areas between the Recknitz, Peene and Ryck rivers were the settlement area of the West Slavic Rani (or Rujani) tribe. After Otto von Bamberg's mission, only the Rani principality of Rugia (Rügen) remained pagan. This was changed by a Danish expedition of 1168, launched by Valdemar I of Denmark and Absalon, archbishop of Roskilde. The Danish success in this expedition ended a series of conflicts between Denmark and Rügen. The Rügen princes, starting with Jaromar I, became vassals of Denmark, and the principality would be Denmark's bridgehead on the southern shore of the Baltic for the next centuries. The 1168 expedition was decided when after a Danish siege of the burgh of Arkona, a fire broke out leaving the defendants unable to further withstand the siege. Since Arkona was the major temple of the superior god Swantewit and therefore crucial for the powerful clerics, the Rani surrendered their other strongholds and temples without further fighting. Absalon had the Rani hand out and burn the wooden statues of their gods and integrated Rügen in the Diocese of Roskilde. The mainland of the Rügen principality was integrated into the Diocese of Schwerin.
Danish conquest of all Pomerania (1170–1185).
When the Rugian princes became vassals of Valdemar I of Denmark in 1168, the Saxon-Danish alliance broke apart.
In the fall of 1170, the Danes raided the Oder estituary. In 1171, the Danes raided Circipania and took Cotimar's burgh in Behren-Lübchin. In 1173, the Danes turned to the Oder Lagoon again, taking the burgh of Stettin. Wartislaw II Swantiboriz, castellan of Stettin, became a Danish vassal. In 1177, the Danes again raided the Oder Lagoon area, also the burgh of Wolgast in 1178.
In 1184, Bogislaw I led the Pomeranian navy towards Rügen. On emperor Barbarossa's initiative, Bogislaw was to take the Principality of Rügen from the Danes, whose king Canut VI had refused him the oath of fealty. Though superior in numbers, the Pomeranian navy was utterly defeated by the Danish navy led by Absalon near Koos island in the Bay of Greifswald.
In 1184 and 1185, three campaigns of the Danes resulted in making Bogislaw I, Duke of Pomerania a Danish vassal. These campaigns were mounted by Valdemar's son and successor for the Danish throne, Canute VI of Denmark. In the Duchy of Pomerania the Danish period lasted until Valdemar II of Denmark lost the Battle of Børnehoved on 22 July 1227. Danish supremacy prevailed until 1325 in the Rugian principality. During this time, the emperor formally renounced his claims on the southern Baltic Sea in favour of Denmark.
Society in the late 12th and early 13th centuries.
While in the early 12th century most of the Pomeranians were free, by the late 12th century only the nobility and knights remained free. They were free in their decisions concerning their property and actions, though formally they had to apply for the duke's support.
The class of the unfree still consisted of prisoners of war, but additionally one became unfree after conviction of a major criminal offense or if one was unable to pay one's debts. The unfree made up for an estimated 15% of the population and primarily had to work on the lands of the free.
Most of the population of this time was largely dependent on the duke. This dependency could also result in becoming dependent on a person other than the duke, if the duke granted parts of his lands including the population thereon to a noble, a church, or a monastery. This class shared certain obligations and restrictions with the unfree, for example a head tax, and a restricted right to marry.
Their major obligations were participation in the duke's military campaigns, defense of the duchy, erection and maintenance of the ducal buildings (burghs, courts, bridges), to hand over horses, oxen, and carriages to the duke or his officials on demand, to host and to cater the duke or his officials on demand, to supply rations for the duke's journeys, a periodic tribute in form of a fixed amount of meat and wheat, and also a church tax (""biskopownica"", since 1170 ""Garbenzehnt"").
German settlement.
Beginning in the 12th century, on the initiative of monasteries, as well as the local nobility, German settlers began migrating to Pomerania in a process later termed the Ostsiedlung. The local nobles and rulers encouraged the settlement in order to strengthen and consolidate their position and to develop and intensify land use, while the settlers were attracted by the privileges that were granted to them.
Through a process that spanned three hundred years, in western Pomerania the local Slavic population was mostly assimilated, while in the eastern part, Slavic Kashubians and Slovincians held on to their ethnic culture and identity.
Rural settlement.
Before the Ostsiedlung, Pomerania was rather sparsely settled. Around 1200, a relatively dense population could be found on the islands of Rügen, Usedom and Wollin/Wolin, around the gards of Stettin/Szczecin, Köslin/Koszalin, Pyritz/Pyrzyce ("Pyritzer Weizacker") and Stargard, around the Persante/Parsęta river (Kolberg/Kołobrzeg area), the lower Peene river, and between Schlawe and the Łeba valley. Largely unsettled were the hilly regions and the woods in the South. The 12th century warfare, especially the Danish raids, depopulated many areas of Pomerania and caused severe population drops in others (e.g. Usedom). At the turn to the 13th century, only isolated German settlements existed, e.g. Hohenkrug and other German villages, and the merchant's settlement near the Stettin castle. In contrast, the monasteries were almost exclusively run by Germans and Danes.
The first German and Danish settlers arrived since the 1170s and settled in the Peene area, the Uckermark, the Stettin area and southern Pomerania.
Significant German settlement started in the first half of the 13th century. Ostsiedlung was a common process at this time in all Central Europe and was largely run by the nobles and monasteries to increase their income. Also, the settlers were expected to finish and secure the conversion of the non-nobles to Christianity. In addition, the Danes withdrew from most of Pomerania in 1227, leaving the duchy vulnerable to their expansive neighbors, especially Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, and Henry I of Silesia.
Germans, at this early stage (before 1240), were often settled in frontier regions, such as the mainland part of the Principality of Rugia (after prince Jaromar I granted Eldena Abbey the right to call in settlers in 1209), Circipania, the lands of Loitz (administered semi-independently by Detlev of Gadebush), the Uckermark, the lands of Kolbatz Abbey and Bahn (which later was granted to the Knights Templar), and the area north of the Warthe and along the lower Oder river. However, in many of these frontiers, German settlement did not hinder the advance of Pomerania's neighbors.
Initially, the Germans who settled the northern regions of the Pomeranian duchy predominantly came from Lower Saxony, while the Germans who settled the southern areas ("mittelpommerscher Keil") predominantly came from Altmark and Westphalia. This caused the emergence of different Pomeranian dialects. German settlers also came from areas earlier affected by Ostsiedlung, such as Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, and later also German settled regions of Pomerania herself. The Slavic dialects disappeared, with the exception that fishermen from the isles and the Oder lagoon area continued to use Wendish for a relatively long period.
Besides the Slovincian area, the last records of Slavic language in the Duchy of Pomerania are from the 16th century: In the Oder area, a few Slavic fishing villages are recorded, and east of Kolberg and Köslin, a more numerous Slavic-speaking population must have existed, as can be concluded from a 1516 decree forbidding the use of the Slavic language at the Köslin market.
Foundation of towns.
Before the Ostsiedlung, urban settlements of the emporia and gard types existed for example the city of Szczecin (Stettin) which counted between 5,000 to 9,000 inhabitants, and other locations like Demmin, Wolgast, Usedom, Wollin/Wolin, Kolberg/Kołobrzeg, Pyritz/Pyrzyce and Stargard, though many of the coastal ones declined during the 12th century warfare. Previous theories that urban development was "in its entirety" brought to areas such as Pomerania, Mecklenburg or Poland by Germans are now discarded, and studies show that these areas had already growing urban centres in process similar to Western Europe These population centres were usually centered around a gard, which was a fortified castle which housed the castellan as well as his staff and the ducal craftsmen. The surrounding town consisted of suburbs, inhabited by merchants, clergy and the higher nobles. According to Piskorski this portion usually included "markets, taverns, butcher shops, mints, which also exchanged coins, toll stations, abbeys, churches and the houses of nobles".
Important changes connected to Ostsiedlung included
Between 1234 and 1299, 34 towns were founded in the Pomeranian duchy, this number increased to 58 in the late Middle Ages. The towns were built on behalf of the Pomeranian dukes or ecclesiastic bodies like monasteries and orders. Most prominent on this issue was Barnim I of Pomerania-Stettin, who since was entitled "the towns' founder". The towns build on his behalf were granted Magdeburg Law and settled predominantly by people from the western Margraviate of Brandenburg, while the towns founded in the North (most on behalf of the Rugian princes and Wartislaw III of Pomerania-Demmin were granted Lübeck Law and were settled predominantly by people from Lower Saxony. The first towns were Stralsund (Principality of Rügen, 1234), Prenzlau (Uckermark, then Pomerania-Stettin, 1234), Bahn (Knights Templar, about 1234), and Stettin (1237/43), Gartz (Oder) (Pomerania-Stettin, 1240), and Loitz (by Detlev of Gadebusch, 1242). Other towns built in the 1240s were Demmin, Greifswald (by Eldena Abbey), Altentreptow.
According to Rădvan (2010), "a relevant example for how towns were founded (civitas libera) is Prenzlau today within German boundaries, close to Poland. It was here that, a short distance from an older Slavic settlement, duke Barnim I of Pomerania entrusted in 1234-35 the creation of a new settlement to eight contractors (referred to as fondatores) originating from Stendal, Saxony. The eight, who were probably relatives to some degree, were granted 300 Hufen (around 4800 ha) that were to be distributed to settlers, each one of the fondatores being entitled to 160 ha for himself and the right to build mills; one of them became the duke's representative. The settlers' land grant was tax exempt for three years, and it was to be kept in eternal and hereditary possession. A perimeter around the settlement was provided for unrestricted use by the community of pastures, forests, or fishing. Those trading were dispensed of paying taxes for land under ducal authority. Without being mentioned in the founding act, the old Slavic community persisted as nothing more that a suburb to the new town. Aside from several topical variations, many settlements in medieval Poland and other areas followed a similar pattern."
Many towns with a gard in close proximity had the duke level the castle when they grew in power. Stettin, where the castle was inside the town, had the duke level it already in 1249, other towns were to follow. The fortified new towns had succeeded the gards as strongholds for the country's defense. In many cases, the former Slavic settlement would become a suburb of the German town ("Wiek", "Wieck"). In Stettin, two "Wiek" suburbs were set up anew outside the walls, to which most Slavs from within the walls were resettled. Such Wiek settlements did initially not belong to the town, but to the duke, although they were likely to come into possession of the town in the course of the 14th century. Also in the 14th century, Slavic Wiek suburbs lost their Slavic character.
In western Pomerania, including Rugia, the process of Ostsiedlung differed from how it took place in other parts of Eastern Europe in that a high proportion of the settlers was composed of Scandinavians, especially Danes, and migrants from Scania. The highest Danish influence was on the Ostsiedlung of the then Danish Rugian principality. In the possessions of the Rugian Eldena Abbey, a Danish establishment, settlers who opened a tavern would respectively be treated according to Danish, German and Wendish law.
Wampen, Ladebow, and other villages near Greifswald are of Danish origin. Yet, many Scandinavian settlers in the Pomeranian towns were of German origin, moving from older German merchants' settlements in Sweden to the newly founded towns at the Southern Baltic shore.
Territorial changes in the 13th century.
War with Brandenburg.
During the reign of Otto I, Margrave of Brandenburg and son of Albert I of Brandenburg (1100–1170), Brandenburg claimed sovereignty over Pomerania. Yet, in 1181, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I invested Duke Bogislaw I of the Griffin House of Pomerania with the Duchy of "Slavia" (Pomerania). This was not accepted by the Margraviate of Brandenburg and triggered several military conflicts.
Between 1185 and 1227, Pomerania along with most of the southern Baltic coast remained under sovereignty of Denmark. However, Brandenburg again tried to gain sovereignty over Pomerania, and in 1214 for a short time conquered Stettin. After Denmark lost the Battle of Bornhoeved in 1227, Denmark lost all her territories on the southern Baltic shore, including Pomerania.
At this time, the Duchy of Pomerania was co-ruled by duke Wartislaw III of Demmin and duke Barnim I of Stettin. After the Danes retreated, Brandenburg took her chance and invaded Pomerania-Demmin. In 1231, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II gave the duchy, which then was again a part of the empire, as a fief to the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg.
Denmark also attempted to restore her rule and took Wolgast and Demmin in 1235, but was driven out the same year. Wartislaw had to accept Brandenburg's overlordship in the 1236 Treaty of Kremmen, furthermore he had to hand over most of his duchy to Brandenburg immediately, that was the Burg Stargard Land and adjacted areas (all soon to become a part of Mecklenburg, forming the bulk of the later Mecklenburg-Strelitz area). Circipania was already lost to Mecklenburg in the years before.
In the 1250 Treaty of Landin between Pomeranian dukes and margraves of Brandenburg, Barnim I managed to reassert the rule of his Griffin house over Pomerania, but lost the Uckermark to Brandenburg.
Brandenburg since 1250 expanded eastward. In 1250/52, the margraves gained half of Lubusz Land, including the terra Küstrin between Warthe and Mietzel (Myśla), and the terra Chinz north of the Mietzel river, both previously held by Barnim. In the course of the 1250s, the margraves further gained the castellanies Zantoch and Driesen except for the burghs itself, of both castellanies actually belonging to Greater Poland, Barnim had held the northern parts. In 1261, Barnim lost the Soldin area, and in the following years the terra Zehden to Brandenburg.
In 1264, Duke Wartislaw III of Demmin died, his cousin Barnim I (the Good) became the sole ruler of the duchy. In 1266, Barnim I married Mechthild, the daughter of Otto III, Margrave of Brandenburg.
In 1269, Barnim lost the terra Arnswalde to the margraves. Before his death, he bought the western part back in 1278.
Bogislaw IV lost the Bernstein area and Zinnenburg Land (terra Arnhausen and terra Schivelbein), in 1280. All former Pomeranian territories east of the Oder lost to Brandenburg in the 13th century became parts of the Brandenburgian Neumark ("new march").
War with Silesia.
In 1234 and 1241, Silesian dukes Henry I and Henry II expanded their realm to the North, and even took control of areas north of the Warthe (Warta) river previously held by the Dukes of Pomerania. The Griffin dukes, Silesian Piasts, Dukes of Greater Poland, the bishops of Lebus and the bishops of Kammin all competed for the Warthe/Netze (Notec) area, centered around the burgh of Zantoch. Until 1250, Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania had recovered most of the previous Pomeranian territory and sought to secure them with the settlement of Germans, while Zantoch burgh was held by Przemysł II of Greater Poland.
Competition for Schlawe-Stolp.
The last member of the Ratiborides branch of the Griffins, Ratibor II, died in 1223. This led to a competition between the Griffins and the Pomerelian Samborides for inheritance of Schlawe-Stolp. Because Ratibor died during the Danish period, Denmark administered the area until she had to withdraw after the lost Battle of Bornhöved in 1227. Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania, took control of the lands immediately after the Danish withdrawal, but had to yield Pomerelian duke Swantopolk's rights, whose relationship to the Ratiborides was closer. Swantopolk took over Schlawe-Stolp in 1235/36. The Griffins mounted an unsuccessful campaigns to gain the area in 1236/38, 1253, 1259, and 1266. After the death of Swantopolk II in 1266, Barnim I took over the area and kept it until 1269, when Rugian prince Wizlaw II took over. He withdrew in 1277 and left the area to Brandenburg. In 1283, Mestwin II of Pomerelia took over. Competition arose anew after his death in 1294. In 1296, Wizlaw's son Sambor launched another campaign.
When the area became incorporated into the Pomerelian duchy, the Swenzones dynasty gained control and gradually evolved to autonomously acting counts.

Early history of Pomerania

After the glaciers of the Ice Age in the Early Stone Age withdrew from Pomerania, in what are now northern Germany and Poland, they left a tundra. First humans appeared, hunting reindeer in the summer. A climate change in 8000 BC allowed hunters and foragers of the Ertebølle-Ellerbek culture to continuously inhabit the area. These people became influenced by farmers of the Linear Pottery culture who settled in southern Pomerania. The hunters of the Ertebølle-Ellerbek culture became farmers of the Funnelbeaker culture in 3000 BC. The Havelland culture dominated in the Uckermark from 2500 to 2000 BC. In 2400 BC, the Corded Ware culture reached Pomerania and introduced the domestic horse. Both Linear Pottery and Corded Ware culture have been associated with Indo-Europeans. Except for Western Pomerania, the Funnelbeaker culture was replaced by the Globular Amphora culture a thousand years later.
During the Bronze Age, Western Pomerania was part of the Nordic Bronze Age cultures, while east of the Oder river the Lusatian culture dominated. Throughout the Iron Age, the people of the western Pomeranian areas belonged to the Jastorf culture, while the Lusatian culture of the East was succeeded by the Pomeranian culture, then in 150 BC by the Oksywie culture, and at the beginning of the first millennium by the Wielbark Culture.
While the Jastorf culture is usually associated with Germanic peoples, the ethnic category of the Lusatian culture and its successors is debated. Veneti, Germanic peoples like Goths, Rugians, and Gepids, and Slavs are assumed to have been the bearers of these cultures or parts thereof.
Since the 3rd century, many settlements were abandoned, marking the beginning of the migration period in Pomerania. It is assumed that Burgundians, Goths and Gepids with parts of the Rugians left Pomerania during that stage, while some Veneti, Vidivarii and other, Germanic groups remained, and formed the Gustow, Debczyn and late Wielbark culture cultures, which existed in Pomerania until the 6th century.
The name "Pomerania" comes from Slavic po more, which means Land at the Sea.
Ice Age and Paleolithic (Early Stone) Age (before 8000 BC).
20,000 years ago the territory of present-day Pomerania was covered with ice, which did not start to recede until the late period of the Old Stone Age or Paleolithic some 13,000 years BC, when the Scandinavian glacier receded northwards (Allerød oscillation). At the site of the later Baltic Sea was the cold, saline Yoldia Sea (~11,500-9500 BC), which was succeeded by the fresh water Ancylus Lake (9500-8000 BC).
Hamburgian.
Hamburgian reindeer hunters were the first humans to occupy the plains freed from the retreating glaciers in north-central Europe. However, whether they also roamed Pomerania is uncertain: though there are finds in neighboring regions of Denmark, Mecklenburg and Poland, there are no finds from Pomerania which can be associated to the Hamburgian techno-complex without doubt. Though finds resembling Hamburgian typology were made in Tanowo, these finds likely stem from a later era.
Federmesser, Bromme.
The Federmesser and related Bromme techno-complexes are archaeologically traceable in Pomerania, but finds are sparse. That may be due to Pomerania's location within the fall-out zone of the Laacher See eruption, which in 10970 BC covered the area with a tephra layer and is probably responsible for the emergence of the Bromme techno-complex from the Federmesser one by separating it from the southern groups. A worked giant deer antler and a sharpened horse rib from the Endingen IV Federmesser site were 14C-dated to 11555 ±100 BP and 11830 ±50 BP, respectively, and together with a giant deer skull from Mecklenburg represent the oldest absolutely dated human traces in northeastern Germany.
Mesolithic (Middle Stone) Age (8000 - 3000 BC).
About 8000 BC, the climate started to change, and the former subarctic tundra was transformed into woodlands.
About 7,500 years ago, the Litorina Sea, a predecessor of the Baltic Sea evolved, with its southern coastline being close to the current one.
Maglemosian culture.
The paleolithic Ahrensburg culture was succeeded by the early mesolithic Maglemosian culture (8000-6000 BC), whose members were not only hunters, but also foragers and fishermen. According to their tools, they are grouped as first belonging to the Komornica (east) and Duvensee culture (west), later to the Chojnice-Pienki culture (east). They settled the dunes and used flint stone microliths.
Ertebølle-Ellerbek-Lietzow culture.
Flintstone tools of hunters and foragers from the Mesolithic Age were found at various sites. Most of the artefacts date back to the late Mesolithic Age (since 5500 BC). They belong to the Ertebølle-Ellerbek culture (Lietzow subgroup), a culture that settled the coastline and already used ceramics.
While primarily hunters, it is assumed that the mesolithic people were also foraging, fishing, and even farming on a most primitive scale. They also knew how to build dugout canoes, and with these they travelled down the rivers into the hinterlands. The starting point for these expeditions often was Rügen.
Neolithic (Late Stone) Age (3000 -1900 BC).
Linear Pottery culture.
The move from Middle to Late Stone Age (Mesolithic to Neolithic Age) is marked by the change in the way of life from hunting and foraging to farming and livestock breeding. This was not a sudden change, but took place over a long period. The people of the Ertebølle culture were thereby inspired by the Middle German Linear Pottery culture, whose northernmost frontier was southern Pomerania (Uckermark and the Pyritz area).
Funnelbeaker culture.
From 3000 to 1900 BC Pomerania was settled by farmers and herders of the Funnelbeaker culture (also TRB, Trichterbecher culture), that had evolved from the previous Mesolithic cultures and Linear Pottery culture influence. During this period, Western Pomerania was more densely settled than before, primarily on smooth hills near the water. Artefacts and settlements from this periods have been found at various sites in Western Pomerania, e.g. around the Bay of Greifswald. The Funnelbeaker culture people erected numerous Megalith tombs.
Havelland culture.
From 2500 to 2000 BC, the Uckermark was not influenced by the Funnelbeaker culture, but by the Havelland culture, representing the northernmost area of this culture that was centered around the middle Elbe and Havel rivers. The Bay of Greifswald, Usedom and Uecker-Randow areas were under a weak influence of this culture also.
Corded Ware culture.
About 2400 BC, people of the Corded Ware culture reached Pomerania. They probably originated in the Black Sea area and introduced the domestic horse. While the Corded Ware people have been associated with the first Indo-Europeans, recently the earlier Linear Pottery Culture is said to be Indo-European, too.
While most of Pomerania was part of or influenced by the Single Grave culture subgroup, eastern Pomerelia belonged to the Rzucewo (also Bay Coast or Haffküsten) culture subgroup stretching from Pomerelia to Lithuania, formerly associated with early Balts.
The impact of the late neolithic Corded Ware culture on Western Pomerania was not as strong, but traceable. For example, both Funnelbeaker and Corded Ware culture artefacts were found in a Megalith tomb near Groß Zastrow.
Globular Amphora culture.
The Globular Amphora culture replaced the Funnelbeaker culture in most of Pomerania a thousand years later, but no artefacts have been found in Western Pomerania. This culture is associated with amber trade.
Comb Ceramic culture.
During the mid-Neolithic Age, small populations belonging to the Comb Ceramic or Pit-comb ware culture were traced in Pomerania.
Bronze Age (1900 - 550 BC).
Nordic Bronze Age (Western Pomerania).
While the Bronze Age began in Southern Germany before 1800 BC and had reached the Elbe and Saale area by 1550 BC, the North was still dominated by the neolithic Funnelbeaker culture and Corded Ware culture (Single Grave culture). Only isolated artefacts belonging to the early Bronze Age have been found in Western Pomerania. The early Bronze Age cultures in Western Pomerania are classified as Buchholz group (Plonia group).
From the Late Bronze Age, various settlements and artefacts were found in Western Pomerania. These later Bronze Age culters (periods II and III) are classified as Westpomeranian group (also Wusterwitz or Ostrowice group), and associated with the Grubengrab culture. In this period, settlement became more stable.
Early Bronze Age in Eastern Pomerania.
During the early Bronze Age, the eastern and the southeastern parts of Pomerania were not as densely settled as the western parts. The local cultures were influenced by Iwno culture, later Trzciniec culture. Based on linguistic analyses of toponymes, Marija Gimbutas and others proposed a culture of Pomeranian Balts from the mouth of the Oder, and the whole Vistula basin to Silesia in the South-West.
Lusatian Culture (Eastern Pomerania).
During the late Bronze Age (1200 BC), Farther Pomerania and Pomerelia were under the influence of the Lusatian culture, the north-eastern subgroup of the Urnfield culture. People of this culture burned their dead and buried the ashes in urns, which were typically placed in urnfields but also in tumuli. The Pomeranian variant of the Lusatian culture can further be divided into an eastern and the Göritz group. The sun is assumed to have played a prominent role in their religion, which also included cannibalism. Numerous archeological findings of imported Scandinavian products prove contacts to Nordic Bronze Age peoples.
These contacts and the Scandinavian influence on Pomerania was so considerable that this region is sometimes included in the Nordic Bronze Age culture. The local Lusatian cultures were also influenced by the west-alpine and Hallstatt cultures. Metalworks technologies were imported from the South via the Oder river. The eastern or Kashubian group of the Pomeranian Lusatian culture, characterized by burial rites were burned ashes were placed in burial mounds with stone constructions, imported their metalworks technologies from the South via the Vistula river as well as from the North via the Baltic Sea.
The people of the Lusatian Culture lived either in unfortified villages or in fortified strongholds. The number of such strongholds rapidly increased at about 700 BC for unknown reasons. Towards and during the Iron Age, an increasing wealth is recorded.
There was a dispute between German and Polish historians concerning the ethnicity of the Lusatian Culture people. This dispute had reached its climax in the interbellum and also after World War II. Recent studies conclude a multi-ethnic character, prominently including the Veneti, but also Germanic peoples in the Northwest and Slavic peoples in the East.
Pre-Roman Iron Age.
Jastorf culture (Western Pomerania, 550 - 50 BC).
During the Iron Age, Western Pomerania belonged to the Jastorf culture (550-50 BC). As before during the Bronze Age, the dead were burned and the ashes buried in urns. Settlements and urn grave fields with artefacts were found e.g. in the then densely settled Greifswald area.
The Jastorf culture is associated with early Germanic peoples. Western Pomerania belonged to the Warnow-Oder estituary subgroup of the Jastorf culture, the easternmost group is designated Oder group. The Oder group, formerly thought to have emerged after an immigration from Bornholm, is now thought to have evolved from a local population formerly belonging to the Pomeranian culture and the Göritz group of the Lusatian culture, who first adapted to new habits and later mingeld with a Germanic population from the West.
Pomeranian culture (Eastern Pomerania, 650 - 150 BC).
The Pomeranian culture evolved from the Lusatian culture east of the Parseta river and in Pomerelia. It is characterized primarily by the use of faced urns, also of house urns, placed in stone cists.
This culture is considered to mark the (proto-)Germanic-Baltic frontier. A linguistic classification, whether Baltic, Germanic, or interlink, is not possible. Earlier, the Pomeranian culture was associated with the Bastarnae, yet today the culture is considered to have evolved from the local Lusatian culture tribes.
Oksywie (Oxhöft) culture (Eastern Pomerania, 150 BC - 1 AD).
The Oksywie culture existed in the area of Farther Pomerania and Pomerelia around the lower Vistula river, from the 2nd century BC to the early 1st century AD. The culture is named after the village Oksywie (formerly Oxhöft, today part of the city of Gdynia), where the first artifacts typical of this culture were discovered.
Roman Iron Age and Migration period.
[[File:Germanic tribes (750BC-1AD).png|right|thumb|Germanic tribes
Gustow group, Western Pomerania.
Since the second half of the 1st century AD, settlement in Western Pomerania became more dense. The highest density was reached in the 2nd century. Artefacts, settlements and tombs from this period belong to the coastal group of the Roman Iron Age and are heavily influenced by the material culture of the Oder and Vistula area. Influences from the Elbe area and Scandinavia are found in ceramics artefacts.
Slag from the smelting of iron was found in many settlements, also imported goods, primarily from the Roman provinces, as well as silver and gold. After an archaeological site in Gustow on Rügen, this western Pomeranian culture is referred to as Gustow group. The Gustrow group comprised the coastal territories between the Darß peninsula in the West, and the Rega river in the East, while the adjacent Lower Oder area in the South belonged to the related Lebus group. The Gustow group was closely related to the contemporary Elbe cultures.
In the 3rd century, as in all of Pomerania, many settlements were abandoned, and fewer settlement traces are found in the following period. Though rather scarce, Gustow group settlements were located on better soil due to the increasing importance of plant cultivation.
Wielbark (Willenberg) Culture (Eastern Pomerania, 1 - 450 AD).
The Willenberg or Wielbark culture appeared during the first half of the 1st century AD and replaced the Oksywie culture. This culture dominated the area of Farther Pomerania northeast of the Ihna river, most of Pomerelia and northern Mazovia.
The ethnic background of the Wielbark people is not certain. While in the past, German and Polish historians had associated them with the Goths or Slavs, respectively, recent hypotheses suggest they were a heterogeneous people, though scholarship is divided on whom to include therein; suggestions include the Veleti, Germanic peoples (Goths, Rugians, and Gepids) and possibly Slavs.
From this period, many influences are recorded from the Roman Empire. Coins were in use abundantly. Imported Roman goods and their native imitations, though poorer in quality, were common. Roman luxury goods were also found, but those were most probably reserved for the elite. Besides the import of Roman goods, the society also to a lesser degree copied the social differentiation of the Romans. Many princely graves are known from this period.
Between 170 and 260 AD, settlement in Pomerania became less dense. The Wielbark culture continued to exist in the Oder and Vistula estuaries, in parallel to and under mutual influence of the Dębczyn (Denzin) culture that evolved in its midst. Numerous imported goods found from this period in the Oder estuary, originating in the Black Sea area, the Roman provinces, and Scandinavia underline the contemporary importance of the Oder estuary.
Dębczyn (Denzin) culture (250-525 AD).
In the second half of the 3rd century, the Dębczyn (Denzin) culture (or group) succeeded the Wielbark culture between the Persante and Drawa rivers, and a local, not yet classified culture between the lower Oder and Persante rivers. The adjacent areas to the east were uninhabited by this time. Whether the eastern Dębczyn culture replaced or evolved from the Wielbark culture is not yet known, in the western areas, settlement was continuous. The emergence of this group is characterized by an influence of the Vistula region (Wielbark culture), the expansion of the Gustow group, and many paralleles to the Elbe Germanic areas. The dead were buried unburned. The culture existed until the first quarter of the 6th century, when burial of the dead in grave fiedls stopped.
The Dębczyn group might comprise the archaeological remnants of Tacitus' Lemovii, probably identical with Widsith's Glommas, who are believed to have been the neighbors of the Rugians, a tribe dwelling at the Pomeranian coast before the migration period. Germanic sagas report a battle on the isle of Hiddensee between King Hetel (Hethin, Heodin of the Glommas) and Rugian king Hagen, following the abduction of Hagen's daughter Hilde by Hetel. Yet, there are also other hypotheses about the location of the Lemovii, and that their identification as Glommas, though probable, is not certain.
5th and 6th centuries.
Since the mid-5th century, the dead were not buried on grave fields anymore. Also, hoards of fibulae have been found from this period, especially of the Sösdala and Sjörup type. From the second half of the 5th century and the beginning 6th century, treasures of late Roman solidi, bracteates, and golden jewelry are found. From the same period these treasures were hidden, both hoards of and single solidi have been found, coined by Valentinian III (425-455) and Anastasius I (491-518). These were found in the Debczin group area, the Vistula area, where they are associated with the Vidivarian stage of the Willenberg culture, and in the Oder estituary, where they were found together with jewelry. Some of these hoards might have served as a substitute for burial objects, others might have been buried for some mythological purpose.
In the late 5th and early 6th centuries, large grave fields were set up in the coastal areas, which differ from the Debzcyn group type and show Scandinavian analogies. Findings include fibulae of the Bornholm type, needles with bird heads, and armour (shields, lances and swords) of western European and Scandinavian type.
It is assumed that Burgundians, Goths and Gepids with parts of the Rugians left Pomerania during the late Roman Age, and that during the migration period, remnants of Rugians, Vistula Veneti, Vidivarii and other, Germanic tribes remained and formed units that were later Slavicized. The Vidivarii themselves are described by Jordanes in his Getica as a melting pot of tribes who in the mid-6th century lived at the lower Vistula. Though differing from the earlier Willenberg culture, some traditions were continued. One hypothesis, based on the sudden appearance of large amounts of Roman solidi and migrations of other groups after the breakdown of the Hun empire in 453, suggest a partial re-migration of earlier emigrants to their former northern homelands.

Pomerania during the Late Middle Ages

Pomerania during the Late Middle Ages covers the History of Pomerania in the 14th and 15th centuries.
The Duchy of Pomerania gained the Principality of Rugia after two wars with Mecklenburg, the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp and the Lauenburg and Bütow Land. Pomerelia was integrated into the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights after the Teutonic takeover of Danzig in 1308, and became a part of province of Royal Prussia within the Kingdom of Poland in 1466.
The Duchy of Pomerania was internally fragmented into Pomerania-Wolgast, -Stettin, -Barth, and -Stolp. The dukes were in continuous warfare with the Margraviate of Brandenburg due to Uckermark and Neumark border disputes and disputes over formal overlordship of Pomerania. In 1478, the duchy was reunited under the rule of Bogislaw X, when most of the other dukes had died of the plague.
Hanseatic towns.
The towns of Pomerania that had joined the Hanseatic League acted independently from the duchy, and sometimes opposed the dukes' interest. The most powerful towns were Stralsund, Greifswald, and Stettin, but also Demmin, Anklam and Kolberg. Before the Treaty of Stralsund (1370), and during the reign of Eric of Pomerania, the Hanseatic towns were in a state of war with Denmark for hegemony in the Baltic Sea.
Parts of the Pomeranian nobility were engaged in piracy against Hanseatic vessels. Barnim VI of Pomerania-Wolgast did not only engage in piracy himself, he is also known for providing refuge and hideouts for the Likedeeler pirate organisation.
The relation between the towns and the nobility throughout the Middle Ages ranged from alliances and support () to cabalism, banditry and outright warfare.
Duchy of Pomerania.
Pomerania-Wolgast and -Stettin after the partition of 1295.
The last duke of Demmin had died in 1264, and the 1236 territorial losses left Demmin at the westernmost edge of the Duchy of Pomerania.
When Barmin I, for a short period sole ruler of the duchy, died in 1278, his oldest son Bogislaw IV took his father's seat. When his half-brothers Otto I and Barnim II reached adulthood in 1294, the brothers ruled in common until Barnim's death in 1295. Bogislaw and Otto now agreed on a partition of the duchy, that would last until 1464: Bogislaw's share was the area where the towns were under Lübeck law, that was Vorpommern north of the Peene river (though including Anklam and Demmin on its southern bank) and Farther Pomerania north of the Ihna and Stepenitz rivers, both areas were connected by the islands of Usedom and Wollin. Bogislaw made Wolgast his residence, thus the partition became known as Pomerania-Wolgast. Otto's share was the remainder between Peene and Ihna centered around Stettin, where the towns were under Magdeburg law. This partition became known as Pomerania-Stettin.
A series of wars was triggered by Denmark in the early 14th century, when Eric VI Menved attempted to reestablish Danish rule in Northern Germany. Pomeranian and Rugian towns and dukes were involved in these wars in various and often opposing coalitions. Since 1314, a coalition consisting mainly of Waldemar of Brandenburg, Stralsund, and the Pomeranian dukes opposed a Danish-led coalition joined by Rugian duke Wizlaw III. This war was ended by the Treaty of Templin in 1317. During this conflict, in 1315, Wartislaw IV of Pomerania-Wolgast, grandson of Rugian Wizlaw II, made an agreement with Eric VI Menved's brother Christopher II of Denmark for inheritance of the Principality of Rügen.
Waldemar of Brandenburg died in 1319. Heinrich, his heir, was still a minor, and died in 1320. The Pomeranian dukes and Cammin bishops tried to take advance of Brandenburg's weakness. They did not only envision territorial gains, but also aimed at changing the status of the duchy from a fief of Brandenburg to a fief directly from the emperor. To achieve these goals, the dukes allied with various neighboring states, mounted military campaigns of which the first Battle of Kremmer Damm in 1332 was the most important, and gave their lands to the Cammin bishops (in 1320) and even to pope John XXII (in 1330). In 1337, the Brandenburg margrave had to take the terrae Lippehne, Schivelbein and Falkenberg (all in Neumark) as a fief from the Cammin bishops. In 1338, Barnim III of Pomerania-Stettin was granted his part-duchy as a fief directly from the emperor, while Pomerania-Wolgast remained under formal Brandenburgian overlordship.
The towns Stettin, Greifenhagen, and Gollnow in Pomerania-Stettin, concerned about a permanent division of the duchy in case Barnim III would not have children, rebelled in 1339 and sided with Pomerania-Wolgast in 1341. Barnim had to move his court to Gartz (Oder). On June 12, 1348, German king and later emperor Karl IV granted the Duchy of Pomerania as a whole and the Rugian principality as a fief to the dukes of both Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Wolgast, erasing Brandenburg's claims. The Pomeranian dukes and towns reconciled in 1344/54.
Barnim III, against the will of the burghers, erected a castle within Stettin's walls in 1346 (the old burgh had been leveled in 1249), and gained from Brandenburg the eastern parts of the Uckermark, that was in 1354 Pasewalk, in 1355 Schwedt, Angermünde, and Brüssow, and in 1359 (Torgelow).
First and Second War for Rugian Succession.
The Rugian prince Wizlaw III died in 1325. Because of the earlier death of his son, he had no male heir, and Wartislaw IV of Pomerania-Wolgast took over the principality according to the 1315 agreement with Christopher II of Denmark. Yet, in the meantime Christopher's throne had been challenged by Valdemar III of Denmark, and Christopher had granted Rugia to Mecklenburg for her aid against his opponent. After Wartislaw died in 1326, Mecklenburg invaded the principality. Wartislaw's minor sons were aided by primarily by Greifswald and Demmin, but also by Stralsund, Anklam, and Valdemar III, who decisively defeated the Mecklenburgian army in 1228 near Völschow. In the subsequent Treaty of Brudersdorf, Mecklenburg withdrew her claims for 31,000 mark in silver. In exchange, the terrae Tribsees, Grimmen and Barth were pawned to her. When the Pomeranian dukes in 1340 were not able to bail out these lands, but refused to formally hand them over, a second war started. This time, the dukes of Pomerania-Wolgast were aided by those of Pomerania-Stettin and the Counts of Gützkow. After the Pomeranian forces defeated the Mecklenburgians in the Battle of Schopendamm near Loitz in 1351, they were able to take Grimmen and Barth in 1354 and Tribsees in 1356. Mecklenburg dropped her claims thereafter. Another party in these wars for Rugian succession was the bishop of Schwerin, who sought to enforce his claims by legal means, but was not successful in his appeals to various ecclesial courts.
After the partition of Pomerania-Wolgast (1368–72).
After the death of Barnim IV of Pomerania-Wolgast in 1366, an armed conflict arose when Barnim's brother Bogislaw V refused to share his power with Barnim's sons, Wartislaw VI and Bogislaw VI, and his other brother, Wartislaw V, who in turn allied with Mecklenburg to enforce their claims. On May 25, 1368, a compromise was negotiated in Anklam, which was made a formal treaty on June 8, 1372, in Stargard, and resulted in a partition of Pomerania-Wolgast.
Bogislaw V received most of the Farther Pomeranian parts. Excepted was the land of Neustettin, which was to be ruled by his brother Wartislaw V, and was integrated into Bogislaw's part-duchy only after his death in 1390. This eastern part duchy became known as Pomerania-Stolp. The western remainder of Pomerania-Wolgast was further partitioned between Bogislaw IV and Wartislaw VI on December 6, 1376. Wartislaw VI received Pomerania-(Wolgast)-Barth, the former principality of Rügen, and Bogislaw IV's Pomerania-Wolgast was reduced to an area between Greifswald and the Swine river. When Bogislaw VI died in 1393 and Wartislaw VI in 1394, the latter's sons Barnim VI and Wartislaw VIII ruled in common.
On December 6, 1425, the western part of Pomerania-Wolgast (without Pomerania-Stolp) was partitioned again at a congress in Eldena Abbey, this time among the Wartislaw IX and his brother Barnim VII, who received the eastern part with Wolgast, and their cousins Swantibor II and his brother Barnim VIII, who received the Rugian part with Barth.
In 1456, the University of Greifswald was founded on behalf of Heinrich Rubenow, becoming the first university of Pomerania and one of the oldest in northern Europe.
The situation of the descendants of Bogislaw V, who ruled Pomerania-Stolp, differed somewhat from the situation of their western counterparts. The area was more sparsely settled and dominated by powerful noble families, so not much income could be derived by the dukes. On the other hand, the Stolpian branch of the House of Pomerania had relatives among the royal houses of Denmark and Poland. Casimir IV and Elisabeth, the children of Bogislaw V and his first wife Elisabeth, the daughter of Casimir III of Poland, where both raised at the Polish court in Cracow. Elisabeth would become Holy Roman Empress after her marriage with Charles IV, and Casimir was adopted by and designated heir of his grandfather. Yet, his ambitions were thwarted when Ludwig of Hungary overruled the testament of Casimir of Poland in 1370, Casimir of Pomerania-Stolp only for a short time took the land of Dobrin as a fief. Eric II of Pomerania-Stolp, great-grandson of Danish king Valdemar IV in contrast became king of the Kalmar Union in 1397.
Eric however failed in his most ambitious plan, to make Bogislaw IX Of Pomerania-Stolp king of both the Kalmar Union and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Eric had to leave Denmark in 1449 and ruled Pomerania-Rügenwalde, a small partition of Pomerania-Stolp, until his death in 1459.
Pomerania-Stolp was a crucial point in the knights' land supply route. Bogislaw VIII of Pomerania-Stolp allied with both the Teutonic Knights and Poland, but supported the latter after the war had started in 1409 by blocking his lands for the knights' troops and allowing his nobles to kidnap those who were traveling his lands. For his aid, he was granted the Lauenburg (now Lębork) and Bütow (now Bytów) areas (Lauenburg and Bütow Land) and others, but those were lost in the First Peace of Thorn in 1411.
Casimir V of Pomerania-Stettin at the same time allied with the Teutonic Knights and took part in the Battle of Grunwald, where he was caught by the Poles and bailed out by the knights after the First Peace of Thorn.
The main concern of the Stettin dukes however was the conflict with Brandenburg, primarily in the Neumark and Uckermark regions. Casimir III died in 1372 during a siege of Königsberg (Neumark), after he had managed to receive an imperial approval of his Uckermark possessions in 1370. On May 17, 1373, all dukes of Pomerania concluded an alliance in Kaseburg, but situation eased when margrave Otto III of Brandenburg abdicated on August 15, 1373, and the House of Luxembourg took over the march on October 2 of the same year. In 1374, the Luxembourgians allied with all branches of the House of Pomerania. Pomeranian dukes even held positions in the march's administration.
When Brandenburg changed hands from the House of Luxembourg to the House of Hohenzollern on January 11, 1411, the dukes of Pomerania-Stettin understood their position endangered and reacted with warfare. The first major battle was the second Battle of Kremmer Damm on October 24, 1412. While the dukes of Pomerania-Wolgast had sided with the emperor, disappointment over the emperors disapproval of ridding them of formal Brandenburgian overlordship in 1417 drove them to ally with their Stettin relatives and Mecklenburg. This coalition was backed by Denmark and Poland. A series of battles culminated in a decisive defeat on March 26, 1420, in the streets of Angermünde, and the Uckermark possessions were lost once again.
On September 15, 1423, all Pomeranian dukes (including Eric) allied with the Teutonic Knights against Brandenburg and against the Hanseatic towns. In early 1425, this coalition was joined by Mecklenburg and Poland and successfully invaded Brandenburg. A peace treaty concluded on May 22, 1427, in Eberswalde, left Pomerania with the Uckermark north of Angermünde. On June 16, 1427, this was confirmed by the Treaty of Templin, which also included a coalition of Pomerania, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg. Yet, in 1440 Pomerania and Brandenburg invaded Mecklenburg, and in 1444 Brandenburg demanded from Pomerania to again hand over the Uckermark to her. When the Pomeranians refused, war broke out again. The first Treaty of Prenzlau in 1448 set the border south of Pasewalk.
Polish-Teutonic Wars.
In 1320 and 1325, Wartislaw IV of Pomerania-Wolgast allied with the Landmeister of the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights in Prussia against king Casimir III of Poland. When the Treaty of Kalisz had ended the subsequent Polish–Teutonic War (1326–1332) in 1343, Wartislaw's sons Bogislaw V, Barnim IV and Wartislaw V changed sides, and Bogislaw V married Casimir III's daughter, Elisabeth. Barnim III of Pomerania-Stettin joined this alliance in 1348. After Poland and Lithuania had formed the Union of Krėva in 1385, and Poland had rejected the claims of Casimir III's grandson Casimir IV of Pomerania-Stolp, Bogislaw VIII and Wartislaw VII of Pomerania-Stolp in 1386 concluded an anti-Polish alliance with the Teutonic Knights, after they had settled their common border. In 1388, this alliance was joined by Swantibor I and Bogislaw VII of Pomerania-Stettin as well as Barnim VI and Wartislaw VI of Pomerania-Wolgast.
Later in 1388 however, the dukes of Pomerania-Stolp left this alliance and sided with Poland, who had promised to partially respect their claims as Casimir III's heirs. Thence, the nobles of Pomerania-Stolp robbed the Teutonic knights and their supply routes, provoking a counter-attack that destroyed many noble strongholds and the fortifications of Köslin (now Koszalin). Bogislaw VIII, Barnim V and Wartislaw VII reacted by siding with Polish king Jogaila and concluding mutual trade alleviations.
When Wartislaw VII died, Bogislaw VIII and Barnim V concluded a treaty with the Teutonic Knights to safeguard their supply routes in turn for a financial credit. Swantibor I and Bogislaw VII of Pomerania-Stettin changed sides in 1395 and allied with the knights in turn for financial aid. Barnim V in 1397 concluded an alliance with Poland, married Vytautas' niece Hedwig and was in Jogaila's service in 1401 until he died in 1402 or 1404. Bogislaw VIII also entered into Jogaila's service, but changed sides in 1407/08, when he allied with the Teutonic Knights and settled their common border.
Nikolaus Bock, Cammin bishop from 1398–1410, had also sided with the knights before and placed his bishopric under their suzerainity. Wartislaw VIII of Pomerania-Wolgast allied with the knights in return for an assumption of a debt and additional payments. Swantibor I and Bogislaw VII of Pomerania-Stettin joined this alliance in 1409, after they had concluded a ten-year truce with the knights in return for debt cancellation before. When the knights lost the Battle of Tannenberg in 1410, Bogislaw VIII of Pomerania-Stolp changed sides again and allied with Poland in return for the Bütow, Schlochau, Preußisch-Friedland, Baldenburg, Hammerstein and Schivelbein areas, which Poland had gained from the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights before. This was however cancelled by the First Peace of Thorn in 1411.
While Bogislaw VIII nevertheless upheld his alliance with Jogaila, Konrad Bonow of the Cammin diocese in 1414 concluded an alliance with the Teutonic knights against both Bogislaw VIII and Jogaila, which was turned into a truce soon after. In 1417, Bogislaw VIII and the Teutonic knights settled their common border in the Hammerstein area, ending their conflicts. Bogislaw VIII's son Bogislaw IX together with all other Pomeranian dukes in 1423 allied with the Teutonic knights.
Gain of Lauenburg and Bütow Land (1455–1467).
Eric II of Pomerania-Wolgast and successor of Bogislaw IX in Pomerania-Stolp again allied with Jogaila and his son and successor Casimir IV in his Thirteen Years' War against the Teutonic Knights. On January 3, 1455, he in turn was granted the Lauenburg and Bütow Land at the Pomerelian frontier. When Lauenburg was retaken by the knights in 1459, the Polish king was upset and ravaged the Stolp area. Eric reconciled with the king on August 21, 1466, and bought the town from the knights on October 11, six days before the Second Peace of Thorn, that was signed by Eric in 1467.
Bogislaw X becomes sole ruler of the duchy of Pomerania (1478).
Pomerania-Wolgast was reunited following the death of both Barnim VII and Barnim VIII in 1451. Both dukes died of the plague. The same disease caused the death of Joachim of Pomerania-Stettin (also in 1451), Ertmar and Swantibor, children of Wartislaw X, and Otto III of Pomerania-Stettin (all in 1464). Thus, the line of Pomerania-Stettin had died out.
The extinction of the House of Pomerania-Stettin triggered a conflict about inheritance with the Margraviate of Brandenburg. In the Treaty of Soldin of 1466, a compromise was negotiated: Wartislaw X and Eric II, the dukes of Pomerania, took over Pomerania-Stettin as a Brandenburgian fief. This was disputed already during the same year by the emperor, who intervened against the Brandenburgian overlordship of Pomerania. This led to a series of further warfare and truces, that were ended by the Treaty of Prenzlau of 1472, basically confirming the ruling of the Soldin treaty, but settling on a border north of Gartz (Oder) resembling Brandenburg's recent gains. This treaty was accepted by the emperor.
In 1474, Eric II died of the plague, and his son Bogislaw X inherited Pomerania-Stolp. Bogislaw's brothers had died the same year. After the death of his uncle Wartislaw X in 1478, he became the first sole ruler in the Duchy of Pomerania since almost 200 years.
Eric II had left Pomerania in tense conflicts with Brandenburg and Mecklenburg. Bogislaw managed to resolve these conflicts by both diplomatic and military means. He married his sister, Sophia, to Magnus, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and his other sister, Magarete, was married to Magnus' brother Balthasar. Bogislaw himself married Magarete, daughter of Brandenburg's Prince-elector Frederick II. Also, in 1478, Bogislaw regained areas lost to Brandenburg by his father, most notably the town of Gartz and other small towns and castles north of the Brandenburgian Uckermark. During the confirmation of the Peace of Prenzlau in 1479, the border was finally settled north of Strasburg and Bogislaw had to take his possessions as a fief from Brandenburg.
Pomerelia.
Brandenburg, Poland and the Teutonic Order compete for Pomerelia (1294–1309).
After Mestwin II, the last member of the Samborides that ruled the Duchy of Pomerelia died in 1294, disputes over succession arose. Involved in internal dynastic conflicts, Mestwin had promised his duchy to Conrad, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal, for aiding him in his struggles with his brother, Wratislaw. Yet, in the 1282 Treaty of Kępno he named his ally Przemyslaw II, duke and later king of Poland, as his co-ruler and succesor in Pomerelia. The Teutonic Order, who also held claims regarding Pomerelia, had inherited Mewe from Sambor II, thus gaining a foothold on the left bank of the Vistula. 
At the beginning of the 14th century, the region was plunged into war involving local Pomeranian nobility and the principality of Margraviate of Brandenburg to the west, which had acquired some rights to a few localities in the Treaty of Arnswalde of 1269. Brandenburg's claim to the harbour city and Pomerania was partially based on a treaty of August 8, 1305, between the Rulers of Brandenburg and Wenceslaus III, promising the Meissen territory to the Bohemian crown in exchange for Pomerelia, although that treaty was never finalized.
On becoming king of Poland, in summer 1300, Wenceslaus II of Bohemia asked the Teutonic Knights to protect Pomerania from the claims of Brandenburg. In 1306 Władysław Łokietek's forces garrisoned Gdańsk. Also in 1306–07, Brandenburg took the Sławno, and in 1308 the land of Słupsk. When Gdańsk was subsequently attacked by the Margrave of Brandenburg in 1308, Łokietek was unable to help and called in the Teutonic Knights for support. The Brandenburgers were repelled. The Teutonic Knights however, took over the city and ousted the remaining Polish garrison from the castle. The Poles claimed that the Knights committed a massacre of 10,000 civilians; modern historians and archaeologists believe that while the number 10,000 is an exaggeration, an actual massacre of the populace did take place.
Pomerelia in the Teutonic Knights' monastic state (1309–1466).
Teutonic Grandmaster Siegfried von Feuchtwangen joined Pomerelia to the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. The Margraves sold the area to the Teutonic Order in the 1309 Treaty of Soldin. Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor ratified the Soldin Treaty in 1313.
Schlawe-Stolp as a part of Brandenburg, the Teutonic Knights' state and Pomerania-Wolgast.
The districts of Sławno (Schlawe), Darłowo (Rügenwalde) and Słupsk (Stolp), however, remained with Brandenburg. Previously, they were part of Pomerelia.
In 1316–17, the Griffin duke of Pomerania-Wolgast took over these areas as a fief from Waldemar of Brandenburg. In 1347, the area became fully attached to Pomerania-Wolgast. The lands of Stolp were pawned to the Teutonic Order from 1329 to 1341, the Bütow area was bought by the knights in 1329 and thus remained outside Pomerania-Wolgast. The Swenzones family was "de facto" ruling the area regardless of the respective overlord, their power was broken only by the dukes of Pomerania-Wolgast.

History of Pomerania (1933–45)

History of Pomerania (1933–45) covers the History of Pomerania before and during World War II.
The name "Pomerania" comes from Slavic po more, which means Land at the Sea.
In 1933, the German Province of Pomerania like all of Germany came under control of the Nazi regime. During the following years, the Nazis led by Gauleiter Franz Schwede-Coburg manifested their power through the process known as Gleichschaltung and repression of their opponents.
At the same time, the Pomeranian Voivodeship was part of the Second Polish Republic, led by Józef Piłsudski. With respect to Polish Pomerania Nazi diplomacy as parts of its initial attempts to subordinate Poland into Anti-Comintern Pact aimed at incorporation of the Free City of Danzig into the Third Reich and an extra-territorial transit route through Polish territory, which was rejected by the Polish government, that feared economic blackmail by Nazi Germany, and reduction to puppet status.
In 1939, the German Wehrmacht invaded Poland engaging in series of massacres against the civilian population, the most notable among them being the Mass murders in Piaśnica. Polish Pomerania with a part of Kashubia was made part of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. The German state set up concentration camps, performed expulsion of the Poles and Jews, and systematically engaged in genocide of people they regarded as Untermensch (primarily, Jews and ethnic Poles).
In 1945, Pomerania was taken by the Red Army during the East Pomeranian Offensive and the Battle of Berlin. Along with the Soviet offensive, atrocities against the German civilian population occurred on a large scale.
Pomerania and the National Socialists.
Pomeranian Voivodeship.
The totalitarian and anti-Polish Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler, took power in Germany in 1933. By this time, the Second Polish Republic was led by Józef Piłsudski who ruled the country as an authoritarian democracy. Hitler at first ostentatiously pursued a policy of rapprochement with Poland, Initially Nazis were able to achieve their immediate goals of territorial expansion without provoking armed resistance; in 1938 Nazi Germany annexed Austria and the Sudetenland after the Munich Agreement. In October 1938, Germany tried to get Poland to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Poland refused, as the alliance was quickly becoming a sphere of influence for an increasingly powerful Germany.
Following negotiations with Hitler for the Munich Agreement, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain reported that, "He told me privately, and last night he repeated publicly, that after this Sudeten German question is settled, that is the end of Germany's territorial claims in Europe". Almost immediately following the agreement, however, Hitler reneged. The Nazis increased their requests for the incorporation of the Free City of Danzig into the Reich, citing the "protection" of the German majority as a motive.
In November 1938, Danzig's district administrator, Albert Forster reported to the League of Nations that Hitler had told him Polish frontiers would be guaranteed if the Poles were "reasonable like the Czechs." German State Secretary Ernst von Weizsäcker reaffirmed this alleged guarantee in December 1938.
The situation regarding the Free City and the Polish Corridor created a number of headaches for German and Polish Customs. The Germans requested the Free City of Danzig and the construction of an extra-territorial highway (to complete the Reichsautobahn Berlin-Königsberg) and railway through the Polish Corridor, connecting East Prussia to Danzig and Germany proper. Poland agreed on building a German highway and to allow German railway traffic, in return they would extend the non-aggression pact for 25 years.
This seemed to conflict with Hitler's plans and with Poland's rejection of the Anti-Comintern Pact, his desire to either isolate or gain support against the Soviet Union. German newspapers in Danzig and Nazi Germany played an important role inciting nationalist sentiment; headlines buzzed about how Poland was misusing its economic rights in Danzig and German Danzigers were increasingly subjugated to the will of the Polish state. At the same time, Hitler also offered Poland additional territory as an enticement, such as the possible annexation of Lithuania, the Memel Territory, Soviet Ukraine and Czech inhabited lands.
Some felt that the Danzig question was inextricably tied to the problems in the Polish Corridor and any settlement regarding Danzig would be one step towards the eventual loss of Poland's access to the sea.
Hitler used the issue of the status city as pretext for attacking Poland, while explaining during a high level meeting of German military officials in May 1939 that his real goal is obtaining Lebensraum for Germany, isolating Poles from their Allies in the West and afterwards attacking Poland, thus avoiding the repeat of Czech situation
In 1939, Nazi Germany made another proposal regarding Danzig; the city was to be incorporated into the Reich while the Polish section of the population was to be "evacuated" and resettled elsewhere. Poland was to retain a permanent right to use the seaport and the route through the Polish Corridor was to be constructed. However, the Poles distrusted Hitler and saw the plan as a threat to Polish sovereignty, practically subordinating Poland to the Axis and the Anti-Comintern Bloc while reducing the country to a state of near-servitude.
Additionally, Poland was backed by guarantees of support from both the United Kingdom and France in regard to Danzig.
A revised and less favorable proposal came in the form of an ultimatum made by the Nazis in late August, after the orders had already been given to attack Poland on September 1, 1939. Nevertheless, at midnight on August 29, Joachim von Ribbentrop handed British Ambassador Sir Neville Henderson a list of terms which would allegedly ensure peace in regard to Poland. Danzig was to be incorporated into Germany and there was to be a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor; all Poles who were born or settled there since 1919 would have no vote, while all Germans born but not living there would. An exchange of minority populations between the two countries was proposed. If Poland accepted these terms, Germany would agree to the British offer of an international guarantee, which would include the Soviet Union. A Polish plenipotentiary, with full powers, was to arrive in Berlin and accept these terms by noon the next day. The British Cabinet viewed the terms as "reasonable," except the demand for a Polish Plenipotentiary, which was seen as similar to Czechoslovak President Emil Hácha accepting Hitler’s terms in mid-March 1939.
When Ambassador Józef Lipski went to see Ribbentrop on August 30, he was presented with Hitler’s demands. However, he did not have the full power to sign and Ribbentrop ended the meeting. News was then broadcast that Poland had rejected Germany's offer.
Free City of Danzig.
In May 1933, the Nazi Party won the local elections in the city. However, they received 57 percent of the vote, less than the two-thirds required by the League of Nations to change the Constitution of the Free City of Danzig. The government introduced anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic laws, the latter primarily being directed against the newly brought in Poles and Kashubian inhabitants. The city also served as a training point for members of the German minority within Poland that, recruited by organisations such as the "Jungdeutsche Partei" ("Young German Party") and the "Deutsche Vereinigung" ("German Union"), would form the leading cadres of "Selbstschutz", an organisation involved with murder and atrocities during the German invasion of Poland in 1939. As throughout Germany, Jews were increasingly persecuted; the Danzig Great Synagogue was taken over and demolished by the local authorities in 1939.
Province of Pomerania.
Pomeranian Nazi movement before 1933.
Throughout the existence of the Weimar Republic, politics in the province was dominated by the nationalist conservative DNVP (German National People's Party). The Nazi party (NSDAP) did not have any significant success at elections, nor did it have a substantial amount of members. The Pomeranian Nazi party was founded by students of the University of Greifswald in 1922, when the NSDAP was officially forbidden. The university's rector Karl Theodor von Vahlen became Gauleiter (head of the provincial party) in 1924. Soon afterwards, he was fired by the university and went bankrupt. In 1924, the party had 330 members, and in December 1925, 297 members. The party was not present in all of the province. The members were concentrated mainly in Western Pomerania and internally divided. Vahlen retired from the Gauleiter position in 1927 and was replaced by Walther von Corswandt, a Pomeranian knight estate holder.
Corswandt led the party from his estate in Kuntzow. In the 1928 Reichstag elections, the Nazis got 1,5% of the votes in Pomerania. Party property was partially pawned. In 1929, the party gained 4,1% of the votes. Corswandt was fired after conflicts with the party's leadership and replaced with Wilhelm von Karpenstein, one of the former students who formed the Pomeranian Nazi party in 1922 and since 1929 lawywer in Greifswald. He moved the headquarters to Stettin and replaced many of the party officials predominantly with young radicals. In the Reichstag elections of September 14, 1930, the party gained a significant 24,3% of the Pomeranian votes and thus became the second strongest party, the strongest still being the DNVP, which however was internally divided in the early 1930s.
In the elections of July 1932, the Nazis gained 48% of the Pomeranian votes, while the DNVP dropped to 15,8%. In March 1933, the NSDAP gained 56.3%.
Nazi government since 1933.
Immediately after their gain of power, the Nazis began arresting their opponents. In March 1933, 200 people were arrested, this number rose to 600 during the following months. In Stettin-Bredow, at the site of the bankrupt Vulcan-Werft shipyards, the Nazis set up a short-lived "wild" concentration camp from October 1933 to March 1934, where SA maltreated their victims. The Pomeranian SA in 1933 had grown to 100,000 members.
Oberpräsident von Halfern retired in 1933, and with him one third of the Landrat and Oberbürgermeister (mayor) officials.
Also in 1933, an election was held for a new provincial parliament, which then had a Nazi majority. Decrees were issued that shifted all issues formerly in responsibility of the parliament to the "Provinzialausschuß" commission, and furthermore, shifted the power to decide on these issues from the "Provinzialausschuß" to the "Oberpräsident" official, although he had to hear the "Provinzialrat" commission before. Once the power was shifted to the Oberpräsident with the Provinzialrat as an advisor, all organs of the "Provinzialverband" ("Provinziallandtag" (parliament), "Provinzialausschuß and all other commissions), the former self-administration of the province, were dissolved except for the downgraded Provinzialrat, which assembled about once a year without making use of its advisory rights. The "Landeshauptmann" position, the Provinzialverband's head, was not abolished. From 1933, Landeshauptmann would be a Nazi who was acting in line with the Oberpräsident. The law entered into force on April 1, 1934.
In 1934, many of the heads of the Pomeranian Nazi-movement were exchanged. SA leader von Heydebreck was shot in Stadelheim near Munich due to his friendship to Röhm. Gauleiter von Karpenstein was arrested for two years and banned from Pomerania due to conflicts with the NSDAP headquarters. His substitute, Franz Schwede-Coburg, replaced most of Karpenstein's staff with Corswant's earlier staff, friends of him from Bavaria, and SS. From the 27 Kreisleiter officials, 23 were forced out of office by Schwede-Coburg, who became Gauleiter on July 21, and Oberpräsident on July 28, 1934.
As in all of Nazi Germany, the Nazis established totalitarian control over the province by Gleichschaltung.
German anti-Nazi resistance.
Resistance groups formed in the economical centers, especially in Stettin, from where most arrests were reported.
Resistance is also reported from members of the nationalist conservative DNVP. The monarchist Herbert von Bismarck-Lasbeck was forced out of office in 1933. The conservative newspaper Pommersche Tagespost was banned in 1935 after printing an article of monarchist Hans-Joachim von Rohr. In 1936, four members of the DNVP were tried for founding a monarchist organization.
Other DNVP members, who had addressed their opposition already before 1933, were arrested multiple times after the Nazis had taken over. Ewald Kleist-Schmenzin, Karl Magnus von Knebel-Doberitz, and Karl von Zitzewitz were active resistants.
Within the Protestant church, resistant was organized within the Pfarrernotbund (150 members in late 1933) and Confessing Church ("Bekennende Kirche"), the successor organization, headed by Reinold von Thadden-Trieglaff. In March 1935, 55 priests were arrested. The Confessing Church maintained a preachers' seminar headed by Dietrich Bonhoeffer in Zingst, which moved to Finkenwalde in 1935 and to Köslin and Groß Schlönwitz in 1940. Within the Catholic Church, the most prominent resistance member was Greifswald priest Alfons Wachsmann, who was executed in 1944.
After the failed assassination attempt of Hitler on July 20, 1944, Gestapo arrested thirteen Pomeranian nobles and one burgher, all knight estate owners. Of those, Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin had contacted Winston Churchill in 1938 to inform about the work of the German opposition to the Nazis, and was executed in April 1945. Karl von Zitzewitz had connections to the Kreisauer Kreis group. Among the other arrested were Malte von Veltheim Fürst zu Putbus, who died in a concentration camp, as well as Alexander von Kameke and Oscar Caminecci-Zettuhn, who both were executed.
Territorial changes in 1938.
In 1938-39, the German as well as the Polish Pomeranian provinces were enlarged. Most of Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia and two counties of Brandenburg were made a district of the German Province of Pomerania. Several counties from Mazovia and Greater Poland were joined to the Polish Pomeranian Voivodship, and her capital was moved from Toruń to Bydgoszcz (Bromberg).
World War II (1939–1945).
The dispute between Germany and Poland over rights to Free City of Danzig and land transit through the Polish Corridor to the exclave of East Prussia, served as Hitler's pretext for Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland, which commenced on September 1, 1939. The strategy of the Nazi government was to temporarily divide Poland with Stalin's Soviet Union, formalized in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. In the longer perspective, the Nazis aimed to expand the German ""Lebensraum"" in the East, to exploit soil, oil, minerals and workforce from the lands of the Slavs, turning them into a race of slaves destined to serve the German 1000 Year Reich and its master race. The fate of other peoples of these territories, notably Jews and Gypsies, was to be annihilation and deportation during the Holocaust.
Deportation of the Pomeranian Jews.
In 1933, about 7,800 Jews lived in the Province of Pomerania, of which a third lived in Stettin. The other two thirds were living all over the province, Jewish communities numbering more than 200 people were in Stettin, Kolberg, Lauenburg, and Stolp.
When the Nazis started to terrorize Jews, many emigrated. Twenty weeks after the Nazis seized power, the number of Jewish Pomeranians had already dropped by eight percent.
Besides the repressions Jews had to endure in all Nazi Germany, including the destruction of the Pomeranian synagoges on November 9, 1938 (Reichskristallnacht), all male Stettin Jews were deported to Oranienburg concentration camp after this event and kept there for several weeks.
On February 12 and 13, 1940, the remaining 1,000 to 1,300 Pomeranian Jews, regardless of sex, age and health, were deported from Stettin and Schneidemühl to the Lublin-Lipowa Reservation, that had been set up following the Nisko Plan in occupied Poland. Among the deported were intermarried non-Jewish women. The deportation was carried out in an inhumane manner. Despite low temperatures, the carriages were not heated. No food had been allowed to be taken along. The property left behind was liquidated. Up to 300 people perished from the deportation itself. In the Lublin area under Kurt Engel's regime, the people were subject to inhumane treatment, starvation and murder. Only a few survived the war.
Regarding the Jewish community from the Schneidemühl area, JewishGen with reference to research by Peter Simonstein Cullman says that the widespread belief of the Schneidemühl Jews being deported along with the Stettin Jews is contradicted by the respective files in the Bundesarchiv and USHMM archives. While there were indeed such orders and Jews from the Schneidemühl area were rounded up after 15 February, an intervention of the Association of Jews in Germany ("Reichsvereinigung") resulted in a change of the Nazi plans on 21 February: instead of deportation to the Generalgouvernement like the Stettin Jews, these people were to be deported to places within the Altreich. Deportations to transit and death camps followed.
Invasion and occupation of the Polish Corridor and Danzig.
Military campaign.
The invasion of Poland by the Wehrmacht on September 1, 1939, which marked the beginning of World War II, was in part mounted from the Province of Pomerania. General Guderian's 19th army corps attacked from the Schlochau and Preußisch Friedland areas, which since 1938 belonged to the province ("Grenzmark Posen-Westpreußen").
Initially, the Heinz Guderian' tank corps was to pass through Pomerelia (Polish Corridor) on their way to East Prussia. The Guderian corps was to regroup there and attack Warsaw from the east. The Polish opponent was the Army of Pomerania ("Armia Pomorze"), defeated in the Battle of Tuchola Forest. Krojanty charge was one of the famous episodes of the operation where the Polish cavalry unit charged and dispersed German infantry, but then run into the machine guns of German hidden armed reconnaissance vehicles. The episode was used in Nazi propaganda
After the initial battles in Pomerelia, the remains of the Polish Army of Pomerania withdrew to the southern bank of the Vistula river. After defending Toruń (Thorn) for several days, the army withdrew further south under pressure of the overall strained strategic situation, and took part in the main battle of Bzura. On the borders of the Free City of Danzig, there were two fortified Polish points: the Polish post office in Danzig and the Polish ammunition store on the Westerplatte. Both were ordered to defend up to 12 hours in case of local uprising, until an expected relief by the Polish army. The Polish Post office was held by 52 employees led by Konrad Guderski against the German Danzig police, Home Guard (Heimwehr) and SS, which after 14 hours of battle set the building on fire with flamethrowers. All but four postman who escaped either died in the battle or were executed by the Germans as partisans (only in 1995 did the German court at Lübeck invalidate the 1939 ruling and rehabilitate the "postmen"). The Polish Military Transit Depot ("Polska Wojskowa Składnica Tranzytowa") on the Westerplatte repelled countless attacks by the Danzig Police, SS, the Kriegsmarine and the Wehrmacht. Finally, the Westerplatte crew surrendered on 7 September, having exhausted their supplies of food, water, ammunition and medicines, becoming one of the symbols of Polish resistance to the German invasion. The heaviest fighting in Pomerelia took place at the Hel peninsula Polish Navy base, which held out as one of the last centres of Polish military resistance until October 3, 1939 ("see Battle of Hel").
Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia.
The Pomeranian Voivodeship (Polish Corridor) and the Free City of Danzig were annexed by Nazi-Germany on October 8, 1939, and fused into Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia.
Role of German minority during Nazi invasion of Poland and atrocities against the Polish, Kashubian, and Jewish population.
In the interwar period German minority organizations in Poland such as Jungdeutsche Partei, Deutsche Vereinigung, Deutscher Volksbund and Deutscher Volksverband actively cooperated with Nazi Germany through espionage, sabotage, provocations and political indoctrination. They maintained close contact with and were directed by the NSDAP, Auslandsorganisation, Gestapo, SD and Abwehr.
In Pomerania German secret organisations were established with the aim of taking part in dismemberment of Poland and weapons were smuggled across the German border
After the war started, acts of sabotage occurred and Polish authorities interned 126 Germans in Pomeranian Voivodeship suspected of cooperating with Nazis and involved in anti-Polish activities, based on previously prepared lists, and shipped them away east from the potential front line.
Before the war, activists from German minority organisations in Poland helped to organize lists of Poles who later were to be arrested or executed in Operation Tannenberg.
With the beginning of the Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, Selbstschutz units engaged in hostility towards the Polish population and military, and performed sabotage operations helping the German attack on the Polish state.
Bernhard Chiari and Jerzy Kochanowski state estimates of an overall death toll ranging from 2,000 to 3,841 West Prussian ethnic Germans who lost their lives in the context of the invasion. In a report issued after the German historians' summit in 2000, death toll estimates were summarized at about 4,500 in West Prussia, including those killed in ethnic violence, those killed while serving in the Polish army, and those killed in other war-related events like German air raids. Historian Tomasz Chinciński gives a total of 3,257 deaths, 2000 of them being victims either of the normal wartime conditions (including civilians incidentally killed by advancing German army), or of participation in diversionary actions organized by Nazi sympathetics. The most infamous supposed incident of violence involving suspected Nazi fifth columnists was Bloody Sunday in Bydgoszcz (Bromberg) , which was used excessively by Nazi propaganda, which vastly inflated death tolls of up to 58,000. Since then these claims have been discredited.
By 5 October 1939, in West Prussia, Selbstschutz units made from German minority members under the command of Ludolf von Alvensleben were 17,667 men strong, and had already executed 4,247 Poles, while Alvensleben complained to Selbstschutz officers that too few Poles had been shot. (German officers had reported that only a fraction of Poles had been "destroyed" in the region with the total number of those executed in West Prussia during this action being about 20,000. One Selbstschutz commander, Wilhelm Richardt, said in Karolewo (Karlhof) camp that he did not want to build big camps for Poles and feed them, and that it was an honour for Poles to fertilize the German soil with their corpses
About 80% of the German male adults of the Reichsgau were organized by the SS in Selbstschutz units following the German conquest. most notably at the massacres in Piaśnica forest. This resulted in between 12,000 and 20,000 dead until October 25, and up to 60,000 dead in the first six month. The highest death toll was paid during the initial stage of the occupation. Estimates range from 36.000 to 42.000 killed.
Units were prepared before the war to sabotage Polish war efforts as well as organized mass executions of Poles. Executions aiming at the extermination of the Polish population started only hours after the invasion. During September 1939, Wehrmacht took the main part in atrocities as well as Einsatzgruppen of Sipo and SD (police and security service). From September 1939 to January 1940, atrocities were primarily committed by Selbstschutz units.
During the September campaign, security police set up first concentration camps for Poles. Deportations to the General Government and Stutthof soon followed. Use of the Polish language was strictly forbidden, even in church, by the German Roman Catholic Bishop Carl Maria Splett.
Provisional prisones were set up in Danzig (Gdańsk) and Pruszcz Gdański. Prisoners were treated extremely brutally. Later Poles who were arrested were moved to Stutthof concentration camp. In Gdynia, based on lists prepared before the war, units of SS-Wachsturmbann Eimann, military units, Gestapo, and police arrested thousands of people. They were transported to concentration camps in Gdynia-Grabówek, Redłów, Victoria Schule or Stutthof.
On the territories of counties: Tczewski, Starogardzki, Kartuski, Kościerski and Morski numerous arrests and executions took place. In the area of Szpęgawski Forest many Jews were murdered.
The repressions in Bydgoszcz (Bromberg), the site of the Bloody Sunday (1939) events, were especially harsh. Bydgoszcz soon became a symbol of Nazi German terror. The "liquidation" action was carried out by Wehrmacht soldiers, operational groups and Selbstschutz. Mass arrests of Bydgoszcz citizens took place from 5 September 1939 until November 1939. Collective responsibility was applied and whole families murdered. On 10 September a special court was set up in Bydgoszcz which gave out 100 death sentences. The overall loss of Polish citizens in the first days of Bydgoszcz’s occupation is estimated at hundreds. Mass murder took place at sites near the town such as the "Valley of Death", Fordon, Tryszczyn and Borówno. Others were in Koronów, Solec Kujawski, Rybieniec, Karolowe, Radzim, Mniszek, and Grupa.
In October 1939, the Polish intelligentsia of Toruń (Thorn) was imprisoned in "Fort VIII" under harsh conditions, before being executed in Barbarka forest (several hundreds), the local airport, and Przysiek.
Also in October 1939, 300 citizens of Grudziądz (Graudenz) were murdered in Góry Księże and Mniszek.
Operation Tannenberg.
Germans especially targeted Polish intellectual and national elites, primarily priests, teachers, lawyers, doctors, officers, land owners, state officials, members of political and social organisations, as well as anyone that could hinder the German plan to enslave the Polish nation (see Operation Tannenberg).
The first pogroms were made by Wehrmacht units and Sipo Einsatzgruppen. They arrested and executed political, social, and cultural activists as well as local government officials. Offices, institutions, and locations of Polish social and political organisations were penetrated. This action was codenamed Operation Tannenberg. Goals were the liquidation of intellectual elites, and destruction of Polish culture, institutions and organisations. Operational groups and Selbstschutz received orders to “politically cleanse the areas”. First arrests of Poles started after Wehrmacht arrived in Free City of Danzig (Gdańsk) on 1 September 1939. With the help of units from SA, SS, and local police Polish officies and institutions were taken over. Polish State Railways workers and custom officers were executed in Szymanków, Kałdów, or in their offices.
Concentration camps for Polish intelligentsia and Jews were set up in the second half of September 1939 in Karolew and Radzim, located in Sępolno powiat.
A high death toll was paid by the Polish clergy. It was a consequence of the old Prussian belief that the Catholic Church is the main pillar of Polish nation and patriotism. This belief was particularly expressed by Albert Forster, Gauleiter in Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. From 701 priests of the diocese of Chełm (Kulm) on September 1, 1939, 322 were executed or died in concentration camps. 38 clergy from Starogard Gdański (Preußisch Stargard) were executed in Szpęgawsko on October 20, 1939. The same day, lecturers and students from Pelpin seminary were arrested by Gestapo and afterwards executed. Similar incidents happened in most of Pomerelia.
Piaśnica Wielka (Groß Piasnitz) was one of the first execution sites in occupied Poland. The executions took place between October 1939 and April 1940. Among others, intellectuals from Gdańsk (Danzig), Gdynia (Gdingen), Wejherowo (Neustadt in Westpreußen), and Kartuzy (Karthaus) were murdered at this site. Additionally, about 2000 mental care clients from the "Altreich" were murdered there. Overall, an estimated 10.000 to 12.000 were killed.
Polish and Kashubian resistance.
Some Poles and Kashubians of Pomerelia organized an anti-Nazi guerrilla resistance group called "Pomeranian Griffin" ("TOW Gryf Pomorski"). The main Polish resistance organization, Armia Krajowa (Home Army), had a dedicated "Pomerania" district, itself was part of the larger "Western" district.
Province of Pomerania 1939-1944.
On manors and bigger farms Polish prisoners of war partly replaced German workforce. In the cities, Polish forced-labourers were exploited by German companies and factories.
Roughly 60,000 German men from Pomerania died as soldiers in the Wehrmacht and SS until May, 1945.
Since 1943, the province became a target of allied air raids. The first attack was launched against Stettin on April 21, 1943, and left 400 dead. On August 17/18, the British RAF launched an attack on Peenemünde, where Wernher von Braun and his staff had developed and tested the world's first rockets. In October, Anklam was a target. Throughout 1944 and early 1945, Stettin's industrial and residential areas were targets of air raids. Stralsund was a target in October 1944.
Despite these raids, the province was regarded "safe" compared to other areas of the Third Reich, and thus became a shelter for evacuees primarily from hard hit Berlin and the West German industrial centers.
After the war had turned back on Germany, the Pomeranian Wall was renovated in the summer of 1944, and in the fall all men between sixteen and sixty years of age who had not yet been drafted were enrolled into Volkssturm units.
The province of Pomerania became a battlefield on January 26, 1945, when in the pretext of the Red Army's East Pomeranian Offensive Soviet tanks entered the province near Schneidemühl, which surrendered on February 13.
East Pomeranian Offensive.
On February 14, the remnants of German Army Group Vistula ("Heeresgruppe Weichsel") had managed to set up a frontline roughly at the province's southern frontier, and launched a counterattack (Operation Solstice, "Sonnenwende") on February 15, that however stalled already on February 18. On February 24, the Second Belorussian Front launched the East Pomeranian Offensive and despite heavy resistance primarily in the Rummelsburg area took eastern Farther Pomerania until March 10. On March 1, the First Belorussian Front had launched an offensive from the Stargard and Märkisch Friedland area and succeeded in taking northwestern Farther Pomerania within five days. Cut off corps group Hans von Tettau retreated to Dievenow as a moving pocket until March 11. Thus, German-held central Farther Pomerania was cut off, and taken after the Battle of Kolberg (March 4 to March 18).
The fast advances of the Red Army during the East Pomeranian Offensive caught the civilian Farther Pomeranian population by surprise. The land route to the west was blocked since early March. Evacuation orders were issued not at all or much too late. The only way out of Farther Pomerania was via the ports of Stolpmünde, from which 18,300 were evacueted, Rügenwalde, from which 4,300 were evacuated, and Kolberg, which had been declared fortress and from which before the end of the Battle of Kolberg some 70,000 were evacuted. Those left behind became victims of murder, war rape, and plunder. On March 6, the USAF bombed Swinemünde, where thousands of refugees were stranded, killing an estimated 25,000.
Many West Prussian Germans fled westward as the Red Army advanced on the Eastern Front. The Hela peninsula and Hela town, northwest of Danzig, were defended by the German army until the end of the war on May, 9th, 1945. 900,000 people where evacuated by ship, mainly by the Kriegsmarine. 200,000 could flee to the more western provinces of Germany on land (most before March, 1945). Only 3% of those who fled per ship died on the Baltic sea due to Soviet torpedoes. On land, due to the harsh winter and due to Soviet air raids, the losses among civilians were much higher.
The roving cauldron of Hans von Tettau's corps was defended by some 10,000 to 16,000 troops, stemming primarily from the remnants of the "Holstein" and "Pommerland" Panzer Divisions, taking with them about 40,000 civilians. This group had managed to break through the Soviet encirclement north of Schivelbein and fought their way toward the coastline. Hoping for evacuation by the German navy, they secured a bridgehead near Hoff and Horst. As evacuation did not happen, they moved on to Dievenow, from where they were ferried to Wollin island on 11 and 12 March.
East of the Oder river, Wehrmacht's 3rd Panzer Army had set up the Altdamm bridgehead between Gollnow and Greifenhagen. The Red Army cleared the areas south of the bridgehead with the 47th Army until 6 March, and the areas north of it with the 3rd Shock Army, reaching the coast on 9 March. On 15 March, Adolf Hitler ordered some of the defending units to reinforce the 9th Army near Küstrin, seriously weakening the Altdamm bridgehead. Hasso von Manteuffel, in command since 10 March, was unable to further defend the bridgehead after 19 March, evacuated most of it on 20 March and had the Oder bridges blown up. The Red Army took the remaining pockets of the former bridgehead on 21 March. 40,000 German troops had been killed and 12,000 captured defending the bridgehead.
Battle of Berlin.
On March 20, Wehrmacht abandoned the last bridgehead on the Oder rivers eastern bank, the Altdamm area. The frontline then ran along Dievenow and lower Oder, and was held by the 3rd Panzer Army commanded by general Hasso von Manteuffel. After another four days of fighting, the Red Army managed to break through and cross the Oder between Stettin and Gartz (Oder), thus starting the northern theater of the Battle of Berlin on March 24. Stettin was abandoned the next day.
Throughout April, the Second Belorussian Front led by general Konstantin Rokossovsky advanced through Western Pomerania. Demmin and Greifswald surrendered on April 30.
In Demmin, nearly 900 people committed mass suicides in fear of the Red Army. Coroner lists show that most drowned in the nearby River Tollense and River Peene, where others poisoned themselves. This was fueled by atrocities - rapes, pillage and executions committed by Red Army soldiers until the city commander had the access to the rivers blocked on May 3.
In the first days of May, Wehrmacht abandoned Usedom and Wollin islands, and on May 5, the last German troops departed from Sassnitz on the island of Rügen. Two days later, Wehrmacht surrendered unconditionally to the Red Army.
Evacuation.
Pomeranian Gauleiter Franz Schwede-Coburg propagated a turn of the war until the very end. Evacuation orders therefore were issued either too late or not at all. Schwede-Coburg even had the authorities repel flight attempts by the population.
Civilian losses.
Many Germans in Pomerania, Danzig (Gdansk) and West Prussia (Pomerelia) died during and shortly after the war due to air raids, but mainly afterwards due to Soviet Red Army atrocities committed in revenge against the German civilians.
The official post-war West German Schieder commission estimated German civilian losses in all of the territories generally called "Pomerania" at:

Pomerania during the Early Modern Age

Pomerania during the Early Modern Age covers the History of Pomerania in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.
The name "Pomerania" comes from Slavic po more, which means Land at the Sea.
The Duchy of Pomerania was fragmented into Pomerania-Stettin (Farther Pomerania) and Pomerania-Wolgast (Western Pomerania) in 1532, underwent Protestant Reformation in 1534, and was even further fragmented in 1569. In 1627, the Thirty Years' War reached the duchy. Since the Treaty of Stettin (1630), it was under Swedish control. During the war, the last duke Bogislaw XIV died without an issue. Garrison, plunder, numerous battles, famine and diseases left two thirds of the population dead and most of the country ravaged. In the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, the Swedish Empire and Brandenburg-Prussia agreed on a partition of the duchy, which came into effect after the Treaty of Stettin (1653). Western Pomerania became Swedish Pomerania, a Swedish dominion, while Farther Pomerania became a Brandenburg-Prussian province.
A series of wars affected Pomerania in the following centuries. As a consequence, most of the formerly free peasants became serfs of the nobles. Brandenburg-Prussia was able to integrate southern Swedish Pomerania into her Pomeranian province during the Great Northern War, which was confirmed in the Treaty of Stockholm in 1720. In the 18th century, Prussia rebuild and colonised her war-torn Pomeranian province.
Throughout this time, Pomerelia was within Poland as province of Royal Prussia with certain degree of autonomy until 1569 when it was further integrated with Polish state. In the late 18th century, it was forcefully annexed by Kingdom of Prussia and subjected to Germanization efforts.
Pomerelia as a part of Royal Prussia (1466–1793).
During the Thirteen Years' War, in February 1454, the Prussian Confederation of cities and gentry trying to secede from the Teutonic Knights' monastic state, asked the Polish king for support against the Teutonic Order's rule and for incorporation of into the Polish kingdom. The war ended in October 1466 with the Second Peace of Thorn, which provided for the Order's cession to the Polish Crown of its rights over the western half of Prussia, including Pomerelia and the districts of Elbląg(Elbing), Malbork(Marienburg), and Chełmno(Kulm).
Royal Prussia enjoyed a certain degree autonomy in its affiliation to the Crown of Poland - it had its own Diet, treasury and monetary unit and armies. It was governed by a council, subordinate to the Polish king, whose members were chosen from local lords and wealthy citizens. Prussians had also seats provided for them in Polish Diet, but they chose not to use this right until the Union of Lublin.
In the Union of Lublin, Pomerelia became reorganized in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. In 1772 and 1793 Partition of Poland, it was annexed by Kingdom of Prussia, which created out of the conquered territories province of West Prussia.
Protestant Reformation (1534).
The Protestant Reformation reached Pomerania in the early 16th century. Bogislaw X of the Duchy of Pomerania in 1518 sent his son, Barnim IX, to study in Wittenberg. In 1521, he personally attended a mass of Martin Luther in Wittenberg, and also of other reformed preachers in the following years. Also in 1521, Johannes Bugenhagen, the "Doctor Pomeranus", the most important person in the following conversion of Pomerania to Protestantism, left Belbuck Abbey to study in Wittenberg, close to Luther. In Belbuck, a circle had formed before, comprising not only Bugenhagen, but also Johann Boldewan, Christian Ketelhut, Andreas Knöpke and Johannes Kureke. These persons, and also Johannes Knipstro, Paul vom Rode, Peter Suawe, Jacob Hogensee and Johann Amandus spread the Protestant idea all over Pomerania. At several occasions, this went along with public outrage, plunder and arson directed against the church.
The dukes' role in the reformation process was ambitious. Bogislaw X, despite his sympathies, forbade Protestant preaching and tumults shortly before his death. Of his sons, Georg I opposed, and Barnim IX supported Protestantism as did Georg's son, Phillip I. In 1531, Georg died, and a Landtag in Stettin formally allowed Protestant preaching, if no tumults would arise from this. On December 13, 1534, a Landtag was assembled in Treptow an der Rega, where the dukes and the nobility against the vote of Cammin bishop Erasmus von Manteuffel officially introduced Protestantism to Pomerania. Bugenhagen in the following month drafted the new Lutheran church order.
The Duchy of Pomerania joined the Schmalkaldic League, but did not actively participate in the Schmalkaldic War.
With the conversion of most Pomeranians to Lutheranism the Duchy of Pomerania turned into a Catholic diaspora. The Catholic Northern Missions took care of Catholic Pomeranians, directly subordinated to Congregatio de Propaganda Fide in Rome since 1622. In 1667 these missions were taken care by a newly established "Vicariate Apostolic of the Northern Missions", led by a vicar apostolic seated in Hanover and subject to the nuncio in Cologne. Between 1709 and 1780 then Brandenburgian Pomerania was part of the "Vicariate Apostolic for Upper and Lower Saxony".
In 1748 the first new post-Reformation Catholic congregations in Pomerania were founded in the course of King Frederick II's repopulation policy. Palatine Catholics were settled in the five newly founded villages of Augustwalde (a part of today's Szczecin), Blumenthal (a part of today's Ferdinandshof), Hoppenwalde (a part of today's Eggesin), Luisenthal and Viereck. Since 1761 Catholic soldiers in Swedish Stralsund were granted Catholic pastoral care, which developed into the fourth new Catholic congregation in Pomerania. The same happened in Stettin, where the post of the Prussian Catholic military chaplains became the nucleus of the Catholic congregation (est. in 1809). In 1780 the Vicariate for Upper and Lower Saxony remerged into the Vicariate Apostolic of the North, with the next crucial change for Catholic Pomerians taking place in 1824.
Partitions of 1532 and 1569: Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Wolgast.
After Bogislaw X's death, his sons initially ruled in common. Yet, after Georg's death, the duchy was partitioned again between Barnim IX, who resided in Stettin, and Phillip I, who resided in Wolgast. The border ran roughly along the Oder and Swine rivers, with Pomerania-Wolgast now consisting of Hither or Western Pomerania (Vorpommern, yet without Stettin and Gartz (Oder) on the Oder river's left bank, and with Greifenberg on its right bank), and Pomerania-Stettin consisting of Farther Pomerania. The secular possessions of the Diocese of Cammin around Kolberg (Kolobrzeg) subsequently came controlled by the dukes, when members of the ducal family were made titular bishops of Cammin since 1556.
Despite the division, the duchy maintained one central government.
In 1569, Pomerania-Barth (consisting of the area around Barth, Damgarten and Richtenberg) was split off Pomerania-Wolgast to satisfy Bogislaw XIII. In the same year, Pomerania-Rügenwalde (consisting of the areas around Rügenwalde and Bütow) was split off Pomerania-Stettin to satisfy Barnim XII. Though the partitions were named similar to the earlier ones, their territory differed significantly.
In contrast to the partition of 1532, it was agreed that two governments were maintained in Wolgast and Stettin. Decisions of war and peace were to be made only by a common Landtag.
During the 1560s, Pomerania was caught between the Northern Seven Years' War for hegemony in the Baltic Sea and the struggle for hegemony in the Upper Saxon Circle of the Electorate of Saxony and Brandenburg. In 1570, the war in the Baltic ended with the Treaty of Stettin. In 1571/74, the duchy's status regarding Brandenburg was finally settled: While an agreement of 1529 ruled Brandenburg to succeed in Pomerania once the House of Pomerania died out in turn for the final rejection of Brandenburgian claims to hold Pomerania as a fief, it was now agreed that both ruling houses had a mutual right of succession in case of the extinction of the other one.
Also in 1571, a trade war between the towns Frankfurt (Oder) (Brandenburg) and Stettin (Pomerania), ongoing since 1560, was settled in favour of Brandenburg. The struggle within the Upper Saxon Circle however went on. The Pomeranian dukes Johann Friedrich and Ernst Ludwig refused to pay their taxes to the circle's treasury ("Kreiskasten" in Leipzig) properly, and in the rare cases they did, they marked it as a voluntary act. Furthermore, the dukes ratified the circle's decrees only with caveats that made it possible for them to withdraw at any time. The Pomeranian dukes justified their actions with events of 1563, when an army led by Eric of Brunswick crossed and devastated their duchy, and the circle did not give them support. On the other hand, the Pomeranian refusal to properly integrate in the circle's structure likewise reduced the circle's ability to act as a unified military power.
The partitioned duchy underwent an economical recession in the late 16th century. The dukes' ability to control the inner affairs of the duchy severely declined in the cource of the 16th century. As the central power was weakened by the partitions and increasingly indebted, the independence of nobles and towns rose. Attempts of duke Johann Friedrich to strengthen the ducal position, e.g. by introducing a general tax, failed due to the resistance of the nobility, who had gained the right to veto ducal tax decrees at the circle's convent. In 1594-1597, the duchy participated in the . Yet, due to the rejection of financial support by the nobility, the Pomeranian dukes' funds for the campaign were low, resulting in their humiliation during the war for fighting with bad horses and weapons.
The 1637 death of the last Griffin duke Bogislaw XIV and the 1648 Peace of Westphalia marked the end of the duchy. Farther Pomerania came to Brandenburg and Hither or Western Pomerania to Sweden, both later made up the Prussian Province of Pomerania.
Thirty Years' War (1618–48).
The Duchy of Pomerania was occupied by imperial forces in 1627. A capitulation was signed in Franzburg, stating the terms of garrison and war contributions Pomerania had to provide.
In 1628, Stralsund was besieged by Wallenstein, but withstood. Upon entering into the Thirty Years' War in 1629, the Swedish Empire, whose forces entered Pomerania near Peenemünde on July 26, 1630, gained effective control over Pomerania with the Treaty of Stettin (1630), though Imperial forces under Peruzzi held out in Greifswald until June 1631. Duke Bogislaw XIV and the nobility agreed in 1634 on a constitution proclaiming Protestantism as the duchy's religion "eternally". Bogislaw also handed the vast estates of secularized Eldena Abbey over to the University of Greifswald.
In 1635, imperial forces again occupied the duchy. Like the Swedish troops before, they ravaged the countryside as well as the towns. Plunder, murder and arson occurred daily. The people in the Lauenburg and Bütow Land, Draheim, and Tempelburg were forced to adapt Roman Catholicism.
The last major raid of imperial troops occurred in 1643/44.
During the Thirty Years' War Pomerania, lost two thirds of its population due to military raids, plague, famine and criminal violence. Though the countryside was hit hardest, many towns had been burned down, too, especially in Farther Pomerania: Bärwalde, Kolberg, Naugard, Regenwalde, Rügenwalde, Rummelsburg, and Stargard.
Swedish and Brandenburgian Pomerania.
Following the death of Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania without issue in 1637, control was disputed between Sweden and Brandenburg-Prussia - which had previously held reversion to the Duchy. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 enforced a partition into a "Hither" or "Western" and a "Further" or "Eastern Pomerania". The exact frontier was decided in the Treaty of Stettin (1653). Sweden received Hither or Western Pomerania with Stettin (Swedish Pomerania). Farther Pomerania passed to Brandenburg-Prussia. In the negotiations between France, Brandenburg, and Sweden following the Northern War the Brandenburg diplomats Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal and his son Christoph Caspar obtained the rights of succession for Brandenburg, though the argument with Sweden, especially over Hither Pomerania, continued to the end of the 17th century and beyond, until the Treaty of Stockholm in 1720. Stettin and Western Pomerania up to the Peene river (Old Western Pomerania or "Altvorpommern") became part of Brandenberg-Prussia following the end of the Great Northern War in 1720.
Western Pomerania north of the Peene river (New Western Pomerania or "Neuvorpommern") remained a dominion of the Swedish Crown from 1648 until 1815.
Free farmers become serfs of the nobility.
Throughout the High and Late Middle Ages, the rural population of Pomerania was dominated by free farmers working on their own, small, hereditary farms. Although the situation had worsened already before the war, the Thirty Years' War devastation marked a changing point, that was manifested by legal changes and the devastations of the wars yet to come.
Most free farmers who survived the war were stripped of their livestock and had repeatedly lost their crops. Thus, they had to raise their income from service at the estates of the nobles. In Swedish Pomerania, the legal environment was changed by new regulations ("Bauernordnung") in 1647 and 1670. Farmers were now forced by their economic situation as well as the law to serve at the noble estates. The amount of service that had to be done varied, reaching a peak at 75% of a farmer's workforce. Farmers were tied by law to their home village and thus were not free to leave. This kind of serfdom is described by the German term Leibeigenschaft. At the same time, the noble landowners enjoyed the benefits of financial aid programs, and expanded their estates.
A small farmer, however, could free himself from the service by a monetary payment, if his economical standing allowed him to do so. This minority had a considerably better social standing and were personally free.
Second Northern War.
The Swedish Empire started her invasion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from Swedish Pomerania and Livland. Besides Warsaw and Kraków, the Pomerelian (Royal Prussian) towns of Elbląg and Toruń were taken. Brandenburg-Prussia allied with Sweden in the Treaty of Marienburg on June 25, 1656, which was renewed in the Treaty of Labiau on November 20, 1656.
In 1657, Polish forces led by general Czarniecki ravaged southern Swedish Pomerania, and destroyed and plundered Pasewalk, Gartz (Oder) and Penkun.
Brandenburg-Prussia concluded the Treaty of Wehlau on September 19, 1657, and the subsequent Treaty of Bromberg. The Commonwealth therein assured Brandenburg's sovereignty in Prussia and the Lauenburg and Bütow Land, and also pawned Draheim to Brandenburg.
In 1658, Brandenburg-Prussia left the coalition with Sweden and instead allied with the Commonwealth and the Holy Roman Empire.
In 1659, imperial forces led by general de Souches invaded Swedish Pomerania, took and burned Greifenhagen, took Wollin island and Damm, besieged Stettin and Greifswald without success, but took Demmin on November 9. Counterattacks were mounted by general Müller von der Lühnen, who lifted the siege laid on Greifswald by the Brandenburgian prince elector, and major general Paul Wirtz, who from besieged Stettin managed to capture the Brandenburgian ammunition depot at Curau and took it to Stralsund. The Brandenburgians withdrew ravaging the countryside while retreating.
The Peace of Oliva on May 3, 1660, confirmed Brandenburg's rights in the Lauenburg and Bütow Land as well as in Draheim and Sweden's rights in Swedish Pomerania.
Scanian War.
On 19 December 1674, a Swedish army led by Carl Gustav Wrangel advanced into the Brandenburgian Uckermark, taking Löcknitz, and into Brandenburgian Pomerania taking Stargard. In May, further advances into the Uckermark followed. Brandenburgian Farther Pomerania was occupied by Sweden and had to house Swedish garrisons. The war turned on June 18, when the Swedish army was defeated at Fehrbellin, and retreated to Swedish Demmin. In 1675, most of Swedish Pomerania was taken by the Brandenburgian, Austrians, and Danish forces. In December 1677, the elector of Brandenburg captured Stettin. Stralsund fell on October 11, 1678. Greifswald, Sweden's last possession on the continent, was lost on November 8.
Swedish Pomerania was occupied by Denmark and Brandenburg from 1675–1679, whereby Denmark claimed Rügen and Brandenburg the rest of Pomerania. Sweden reestablished control after the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye on June 28, 1679. The strip of land on the east side of the Oder, except for Gollnow and Altdamm, was given to Brandenburg. Gollnow and Altdamm were held by Brandenburg as a pawn in exchange for reparations, until these were paid in 1693.
Famine and the plague.
Famine and the plague further reduced the Pomeranian population. In 1688, only 115,000 people lived in Pomerania proper. The most devastating plague epidemics lasted from 1709 to 1711, leaving up to one third dead. In Stettin, the population was reduced from 6,000 to 4,000 during this outbreak.
Great Northern War.
The first years of the Great Northern War did not affect Pomerania. In 1713, Holstein and Prussian diplomats held talks about Swedish Pomerania, aiming at Prussian occupation of the southern parts and in turn guaranteeing neutrality of this territory. An according treaty was signed on June 22, 1713, by Holstein, Prussia and the Swedish Empire. Only Stettin commander Meyerfeldt refused to hand over the towns without receiving direct order of Swedish king Charles XII. Stettin was subsequently besieged by Russian and Saxon forces led by prince Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov, and surrendered on September 29. According to the Treaty of Schwedt on October 6, Menshikov was paid his war costs by Prussia, and Stettin was occupied by Holstein and Brandenburg troops.
On June 12, 1714, king Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg-Prussia concluded a treaty with the Russian Empire confirming her gains in Swedish Ingermanland, Karelia and Estonia, and in turn received Russian confirmation of his gains in southern Swedish Pomerania.
On November 22, 1714, King Charles XII of Sweden returned from Turkey to lead the Swedish defense in Pomerania in person. In turn, Holstein's forces in Stettin were arrested as a Swedish ally by Prussia. On February 1715, Charles seized Wolgast in an advance to reestablish Swedish control in Western Pomerania.
On May 1, 1715, Prussia officially declared war on Sweden. In the same month, Hanover and Denmark joined the Russian-Prussian treaty of 1714. The allied forces subsequently occupied all of Pomerania except for Stralsund. In the Battle of Stralsund Charles XII of Sweden led the defense until December 22, 1715, when he evacuated to Lund.
After the Battle of Stralsund, Danish forces seized Rügen and Western Pomerania north of the Peene River (the former Danish Principality of Rugia that later would become known as New Western Pomerania or "Neuvorpommern"), while the Western Pomeranian areas south of the river (later termed Old Western Pomerania or "Altvorpommern") were taken by Prussia, who had managed to get France to confirm her gains. Charles, who was not willing to cede any part of Swedish Pomerania, was shot on December 11, 1718. His successor, Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden, entered negotiations in 1719. By the Treaty of Frederiksborg, June 3, 1720, Denmark was obliged to hand back control over the occupied territory to Sweden, but in the Treaty of Stockholm, on January 21 in the same year, Prussia had been allowed to retain its conquest, including Stettin. By this, Sweden ceded the parts east of the Oder River that had been won in 1648 as well as Western Pomerania south of the Peene and the islands of Wolin and Usedom to Brandenburg-Prussia in turn for a 2 million Taler payment.
Seven Years' War.
In September 1757, Swedish troops crossed the Peene river, which at this time marked the Swedish-Prussian border. The Swedes took Demmin, Usedom and Wollin, but were forced back by Prussian general Hans von Lehwaldt, who then turned to Swedish Stralsund. Yet, no significant fighting took place throughout the years 1757 to 1759, although the population had to endure garrison and pay war contributions.
After the Battle of Zorndorf in 1759, Russian troops made their way into Pomerania and laid a siege on Kolberg. When Kolberg withstood, the Russian troops ravaged Farther Pomerania. Sweden and Russia invaded Brandenburgian Pomerania throughout the years 1760 and 1761. Kolberg was again made a target, withstood a second siege, but not the third one in 1761. In the winter of the same year, the Russian troops made Farther Pomerania their winter refuge. In 1762, Prussia made peace with Sweden and Russia.
Brandenburgian Pomerania was left ravaged and the civilian death toll amounted to 72,000.
Rebuilding and Inner Colonisation of Prussian Pomerania.
After the great losses of the previous wars, Prussia began rebuilding and resettling her war-torn province in 1718. Programs were made allowing financial aid to rebuild houses, e.g. people were paid 23% of a house's cost if they build it with fire-proof material, and vacant residential areas were let for free to those willing to erect buildings, also there were cases where those building a house were granted free citizenship, were freed of garrison duties, or were given the necessary timber for free. Also, public buildings were renewed or build new by the Prussian administration.
Swamps in the Randowbruch and Uckermark regions were drained and settled with colonists from the Netherlands since 1718. In 1734, a part of this region became therefore known as "Royal Holland". Dutch colonists were also settled in other parts of Pomerania. Also, Protestants from the Catholic Salzburg region arrived Prussia via the Pomeranian ports. While most went on to settle in other parts of Prussia, some settled in Pomerania.
To improve access to the port of Stettin, the Swine river was deepened and Swinemünde was founded on the river's mouth in 1748. A similar project in Stolp failed due to monetary shortage.
Throughout the 1750s, the vast Oderbruch swamps were drained to acquire farmland.
Prussian king Frederick the Great appointed Franz Balthasar von Brenckenhoff to rebuild the war-torn Prussian share of Pomerania. Before the Seven Years' War, the Inner Colonisation of Farther Pomerania was started already by prince Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau. Brenckenhoff, after providing some humanitarian aid in 1763 (especially horses and wheat from the military and money for seed and life stock), introduced programs for financial aid, tax reduction, and low-rate credits and thus managed to have most of the destroyed farms rebuild in 1764.
In the following years, new farmland was made available by clearing woodlands and draining swamps (e.g. Thurbruch, Plönebruch, Schmolsiner Bruch) and lakes (e.g. Madüsee, Neustettiner See) as well as levee construction at some rivers (e.g. Ihna, Leba).
To compensate for the wartime population losses, new colonists were attracted. In the 1740s, colonists were invited from the Palatinate, Württemberg, Mecklenburg, and Bohemia. Most came from the Palatinate, while the Bohemians soon returned to their homeland due to housing shortages. In 1750, recruitment of settlers started in Danzig, Elbing, Warsaw, Augsburg, Frankfurt am Main, Nuremberg, Hamburg, and Brussels. Protestant craftsmen from Roman Catholic Poland settled in the towns. The colonists were freed of certain taxes and services such as military service. Between 1740 and 1784, 26,000 colonists arrived in Prussian Pomerania, and 159 new villages were founded. Most colonists originated in the Palatinate, Mecklenburg, and Poland.
In 1786, the population of Prussian Pomerania (Farther Pomerania and Western Pomerania south of the Peene river) reached 438,700.
Partition of Poland.
In 1772 First Partition of Poland most of Royal Prussia was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, which created out of its conquered territories the province of West Prussia following year, with the exception of Warmia, which became part of the Province of East Prussia. The Polish administrative and legal code was replaced by the Prussian system, and education improved; 750 schools were built from 1772–1775. He also advised his successors to learn Polish, a policy followed by the Hohenzollern dynasty until Frederick III decided not to let William II learn the language.
Frederick despised Poles and called them "dirty" and "vile apes"-
In the annexed lands the number of schools was reduced and some of them reoriented towards Germanization, while the peasant population was burdened with heavy taxes and twenty years of military service, while Prussian goods could move freely into acquired Polish territories, Polish wool industry(being the largest) was subject to prohibition of export to other Prussian areas; this put local industries at danger
He considered West Prussia as uncivilized as Colonial Canada and compared the Poles to the Iroquois. In a letter to his brother Henry, Frederick wrote about the province that "it is a very good and advantageous acquisition, both from a financial and a political point of view. In order to excite less jealousy I tell everyone that on my travels I have seen just sand, pine trees, heath land and Jews. Despite that there is a lot of work to be done; there is no order, and no planning and the towns are in a lamentable condition." Frederick invited German immigrants to redevelop the province, also hoping they would displace the Poles. Many German officials also regarded the Poles with contempt.
In the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, further annexations were made, with Prussia obtaining Gdańsk and Toruń, Germanised into Danzig and Thorn. Some of the areas of Greater Poland annexed in 1772 that formed the Netze District were added to West Prussia in 1793 as well.

Bernard Tchibambelela

Bernard Tchibambelela (born 14 June 1946) is a Congolese politician who has served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Fishing and Aquaculture since 2012. A member of the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI), he was First Vice-President of the National Assembly of Congo-Brazzaville for a brief period in 1992, and he was Second Vice-President of the National Assembly from 2007 to 2012.
Political career during the 1980s and 1990s.
Tchibambelela, a member of the Lari ethnic group, was born in Brazzaville in 1946. He received degrees in economics, rural law, and agronomic engineering, and he headed banks in Congo-Brazzaville and France. From 1982 to 1989, he was Director-General of the Bank of Rural Credit in Congo-Brazzaville. During the single-party rule of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), Tchibambelela was a member of the PCT; he was considered a protégé of Pierre Moussa, the Minister of Planning and Finance, and he was elected to the PCT Central Committee at the PCT's Fourth Ordinary Congress, held on 26–31 July 1989. Tchibambelela was Economic Adviser to President Denis Sassou Nguesso from 1989 to 1991. The PCT regime was forced to introduce multiparty politics in 1990, and Tchibambelela joined the MCDDI, a new party led by Bernard Kolélas, in 1991. The MCDDI drew its main support from members of the Lari ethnic group, like Tchibambelela, as well as the Bakongo, and it was the dominant party in the Pool Region.
In the June–July 1992 parliamentary election, Tchibambelela was elected to the National Assembly as the MCDDI candidate in the second constituency of Goma Tsé-Tsé, located in the Pool Region. After the election, the MCDDI and six other parties formed the Union for Democratic Renewal (URD), an opposition coalition, on 27 August 1992. The PCT—which had briefly formed an alliance with Pascal Lissouba and his Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS)—then defected to the opposition, and together the URD–PCT alliance held a parliamentary majority.
With its parliamentary majority, the URD–PCT alliance was able to elect the candidates of its choice to the top posts in the National Assembly. In the vote, held on 24 September 1992, the PCT's André Mouélé was elected as President of the National Assembly, while Tchibambelela was elected as its First Vice-President. Tchibambelela held that position for only two months, however; President Lissouba was unwilling to cooperate with an opposition-controlled National Assembly and dissolved it on 17 November 1992.
President Lissouba's dissolution of the National Assembly necessitated a new parliamentary election, which was held in May–June 1993. Tchibambelela was re-elected to his seat from Goma Tsé-Tsé, but the URD–PCT alliance was narrowly defeated by the pro-Lissouba coalition. The opposition furiously contested the official results of the 1993 election, and serious political violence followed. Amidst the violence, Tchibambelela was Vice-President of the "ad hoc" Parliamentary Commission for Peace. An agreement signed on 30 January 1994 facilitated a gradual return to peace.
Tchibambelela remained a Deputy in the National Assembly until October 1997, when rebel forces supporting Denis Sassou Nguesso captured Brazzaville and ousted Lissouba at the end of the 1997 civil war.
Political career since 2007.
Tchibambelela, a member of the National Committee of the MCDDI, was elected to the National Assembly in the June 2007 parliamentary election as the MCDDI candidate in the Mbanza-Ndounga constituency of the Pool Region; he won the seat in the first round with 60.98% of the vote. On 4 September 2007, when the National Assembly held its first meeting of the new parliamentary term, he was elected as Second Vice-President of the National Assembly, receiving 120 votes from the 129 deputies who voted. He was additionally assigned responsibility for the National Assembly's relations with the Parliamentary Assembly of La Francophonie.
As President of the Association of Parliamentarians of the Pool, Tchibambelela released a statement in early July 2009 affirming that all of the Pool's parliamentarians supported President Sassou Nguesso's bid for re-election in the July 2009 presidential election.
Tchibambelela published a book, "Le Commerce mondial de la faim : stratégie de rupture positive au Congo-Brazzaville", through L'Harmattan in October 2009. The book discussed the problem of hunger in the developing world and Tchibambelela's ideas for solving the problem in Congo-Brazzaville.
Bernard Kolélas died in November 2009, and Tchibambelela was subsequently considered one of the main potential contenders for the party leadership, along with Kolélas' son Guy Brice Parfait Kolélas.
In the July–August 2012 parliamentary election, Tchibambelela was re-elected to the National Assembly as the MCDDI candidate in Mbanza-Ndounga constituency; he won the seat in the first round with 71.85% of the vote. However, when the deputies met to elect the members of the National Assembly's bureau for the new parliamentary term on 5 September 2012, Tchibambelela did not receive a post on the bureau. He was instead appointed to the government as Minister of Fishing and Aquaculture on 25 September 2012.
Personal life.
Tchibambelela was a widower by 2007 and had four children at that time.

The Heavenly Kings

The Heavenly Kings (四大天王) is a 2006 Hong Kong film directed by Daniel Wu.
Background.
In 2005, Chinese media began to report that Daniel Wu had formed a boyband, Alive, with Terence Yin, Andrew Lin, and Conroy Chan. Wu and his band mates posted information, updates, personal thoughts (including slamming Hong Kong Disneyland, for which they were spokespersons), and the band's music, at their official website. In 2006, Wu made his writing and directorial debut with "The Heavenly Kings", which chronicles Alive's formation and exploits. After the film's release, however, it was revealed that "The Heavenly Kings" was actually a mockumentary of the Hong Kong pop music industry, and Alive was constructed purely as a vehicle to make the movie; the film's characters represented only 10-15% of their real-life counterparts and much of the footage blurred the line between fiction and reality. Wu admitted his own singing voice "sucked really bad," and the band had their voices digitally enhanced for its music, to prove that "it's easy to fake it."
Reception.
Despite some backlash from the media over being intentionally fed false information in the movie about illegal downloads of the band's music, Wu won the best new director award for the film at the 26th Hong Kong Film Awards, an achievement he called "a group effort."
The film has also been nominated for Best Original Film Song at the same Awards ceremony: Composer: Davy Chan; Lyricist: Li Jin Yi and Singer: Alive.

Vegard Sletten

Vegard Sletten (8 May 1907 – 17 December 1984) was a Norwegian newspaper editor. He worked in "Stavanger Aftenblad" from 1929 to 1945, except for the World War II years during parts of which he was imprisoned, and then in "Verdens Gang" from 1945. He edited the latter newspaper from 1967 to 1977, and chaired both the Norwegian Union of Journalists and the Norwegian Press Association. Like his father Klaus Sletten he was also a Nynorsk supporter.
Early and personal life.
Sletten was born in Kristiania as a son of newspaper editor Klaus Daae Sletten (1877–1946) and Margit Bruun (1875–1958). He was a nephew of Jakob Hveding Sletten and a maternal grandson of Christopher Bruun. From Kristiania his family soon moved to Stavanger via Trondhjem and Ålesund. He finished his secondary education in Stavanger in 1925, and studied at the University of Oslo, the University of Paris and the École des hautes études en sciences sociales between 1925 and 1928. He was hired as a journalist in "Stavanger Aftenblad" in 1929. In 1933 he married Synnøve Erika Gudmundson (1909–2001).
World War II.
In 1940, Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany as a part of World War II. Nazification attempts of the press soon began, and when a member of the Fascist party Nasjonal Samling was installed in "Stavanger Aftenblad" in 1941, Sletten quit his job. He then worked part-time as a teacher, as well as in the illegal press. He was arrested in Stavanger in June 1944, and spent time in Grini concentration camp from June 1944 to February 1945. He was then detained in Berg concentration camp until the liberation of Norway, which incidentally took place on his birthday.
Post-war career.
After the war, Sletten returned to his old job in "Stavanger Aftenblad", but quit after a few months, following a dispute over the appointment of Christian S. Oftedal as editor-in-chief. Instead, he was hired by the newly established "Verdens Gang" in the autumn of 1945. He worked there parallel to editing the weekly newspaper "Norsk Tidend", from 1946 to 1975, and chairing the trade union Norwegian Union of Journalists from 1946 to 1949 and 1952 to 1956. He helped co-found this trade union. In the Norwegian Press Association he was deputy chair from 1947 to 1951 and chair from 1962 to 1971. From 1962 to 1964 he was a board member of the International Federation of Journalists.
Sletten became chief editor of "Verdens Gang" in 1967, and sat until his old age retirement in 1977. The newspaper had multiple chief editors at this time. Sletten replaced founding editor Christian A. R. Christensen, and co-edited with Oskar Hasselknippe, who had held the position since 1953. Between 1969 and 1974 Arne Bonde sat as a third editor. Hasselknippe and Sletten were succeeded by Tim Greve and Andreas Norland. During Sletten's period as editor "Verdens Gang" developed into one of Norway's leading newspapers, more or less trebling its circulation. In 1981 it surpassed "Aftenposten" to become Norway's largest newspaper.
Sletten also chaired the Nynorsk organization Noregs Ungdomslag from 1947 to 1955, following in the footsteps of his father. He was also a member of the Norwegian Language Council and of the board of the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. As a pensioner he wrote "Pressestøtte og pressefridom" ('Press Support and Freedom of the Press', 1979), a book about the Norwegian press support. He also biographed Christopher Bruun in 1986; in 1964 he had issued a collection of Bruun's letters. He was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav and of the Order of the Lion of Finland. He died in December 1984 in Oslo.

Timeline of the 1982 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1982 Atlantic hurricane season was an inactive Atlantic hurricane season, during which five tropical cyclones formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1982 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally limit the period of each year when tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic. However, most of the activity was constrained to the month of September. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipations during the season. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned upon.
This season produced eight tropical depressions, of which five became named storms; two attained hurricane status, of which one became a major hurricane, a storm that ranks as a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricane Alberto was one of four storms to attain hurricane status in the Gulf of Mexico and not make landfall. The other three were Laurie of 1969, Henri of 1979, and Jeanne of 1980. However, rains from Alberto caused severe flooding, which killed 23 people in Cuba. Hurricane Debby was the only major hurricane of the season, peaking as a weak Category 4 over the open waters of the Atlantic basin. Tropical Storm Ernesto was the last storm of the season. It peaked in intensity on October 2 just below hurricane status. The storm dissipated the next day, 58 days before the official end of the season.

Imperial International is a supplier of billiard tables and other cue sports equipment. According to their website, they stock over 10,000 items, from billiard tables to accessories. 
History.
Imperial USA originated from H. Betti Industries, which at that time was called "Betson & Sons", which was an operator for vending equipment, founded by Humbert Betti, Sr. It was one of the sons of the company, Humbert Betti Jr, who ventured into the billiards business, and, in 1952, the billiards division of H. Betti was large enough to be given its own name and to stand on its own, under the name Eastern Novelty. It was not until 1968 that the name Eastern Novelty was deemed inappropriate, and at that time the name was changed to Imperial Billiards. It was also during this time that the company earned much recognition, as they were supplying slate to all major manufacturers. In 1978, Michael DiMotta joined Imperial as a salesman, and, in 1983, he was promoted to President, a position which he still holds today.

Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton

Lady Constance Georgina Bulwer-Lytton ("Jane Warton", "Jane Wharton") (born 12 January 1869, Vienna, died 2 May 1923, Knebworth House) was an influential British suffragette activist, writer, speaker and campaigner for prison reform, votes for women, and birth control.
Although she was raised as member of the privileged, ruling class elite within British Society, she rejected this background to join the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the most militant group of Suffragette activists, campaigning for "Votes for Women".
She was subsequently imprisoned four times including once in Walton gaol in Liverpool under the "nom de guerre" Jane Warton, where she was force fed whilst on hunger strike. She chose the alias and disguise of "Jane Warton", an 'ugly London seamstress', to avoid receiving special treatment and privileges because of her family title . (Her brother was a member of the House of Lords.) She wrote pamphlets on women's rights, articles in "The Times" newspaper, and a book on her experiences "Prisons and Prisoners" which was published in 1914.
While imprisoned in Holloway during March 1909 she used a piece of broken enamel from a hairpin to carve the letter "V" into the flesh of her breast, placed exactly over the heart. "V" for Votes for Women.
She remained unmarried because her mother refused permission to wed a man from a "lower social order" and she refused to contemplate marrying anyone else.
Her heart attack, stroke and early death at the age of 54 have been attributed in part to the trauma of hunger strike and force feeding by the prison authorities.
Family.
Constance Lytton was the second daughter and third child of Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton and Edith Villiers. Lytton was the Viceroy of India where his daughter spent the first eleven years of her life; it was he who made the proclamation that Queen Victoria was the Empress of India. Edith Villiers was Queen Victoria's Lady-in-Waiting (Lady of the Bedchamber) and rode with the Queen's body on the funeral journey from London to Windsor. Edith was decorated with the honorific Lady, Royal Order of Victoria and Albert, was invested in the Imperial Order of the Crown of India and held the office of "Lady of the Bedchamber" to Her Majesty Queen Alexandra.
Constance Lytton's maternal grandparents were Edward Ernest Villiers (1806–1843) and Elizabeth Charlotte Liddell. Edward Ernest Villiers was a son of George Villiers and Theresa Parker. Elizabeth Charlotte Liddell was a daughter of Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth and his wife Maria Susannah Simpson. George Villiers was a son of Thomas Villiers, 1st Earl of Clarendon and Charlotte Capell. Theresa Parker was a daughter of John Parker, 1st Baron Boringdon and his second wife Theresa Robinson. Maria Susannah Simpson was a daughter of John Simpson and Anne Lyon. Charlotte Capell was a daughter of William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex and Lady Jane Hyde. Theresa Robinson was a daughter of Thomas Robinson, 1st Baron Grantham and Frances Worsley. Anne Lyon was a daughter of Thomas Lyon, 8th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and Jean Nicholsen. Lady Jane Hyde was a daughter of Henry Hyde, 4th Earl of Clarendon and Jane Leveson-Gower.
Constance Lytton's paternal grandparents were the novelists Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton and Rosina Doyle Wheeler. Edward Bulwer-Lytton, confidant of Mary Shelley, was a florid, popular writer of his day, coining such phrases as "the great unwashed", "pursuit of the almighty dollar", "the pen is mightier than the sword", and the infamous incipit "It was a dark and stormy night". Constance Lytton's great grandmother was the author and women's rights campaigner Anna Doyle Wheeler.
Constance Lytton's six siblings were :
In the early years in India Lytton was educated by a series of governesses and reportedly had a lonely childhood. Although she matured in England surrounded by many of the great artistic, political and literary names of the day, she tended to reject the aristocratic way of life, and after her father died she retired from view to care for her mother, rejecting attempts to interest her in the outside world.
Lytton remained unmarried until her death, having been refused permission in 1892 to marry a man from a "lower social order". For several years she waited in vain for her mother to change her mind, whilst refusing to contemplate marrying anyone else.
Women's suffrage.
The reclusive phase of Lytton's life started to change in 1905 when she was left £1,000 in her great-aunt/godmother, Lady Bloomfield's estate. She reportedly donated this to the revival of Morris dancing, and her family records state that "Her brother Neville suggests she gives it to the Esperance Club, a small singing and dancing group for working class girls", where part of the remit was to teach Morris dancing. The Esperance club was founded by Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and Mary Neal in response to distressing conditions for girls in the London dress trade.
1908 – Conversion to suffragette.
Between September 1908 and October 1909 Constance Lytton's conversion to the militant suffragette cause was complete. On 10 September 1908 she wrote to Adela Smith:
She subsequently met other suffragettes, including Annie Kenney and Pethick-Lawrence, at the 'Green Lady Hostel' and on a tour of Holloway prison.
On 14 October 1908, Constance Lytton wrote a letter to her mother:
In "Prison and Prisoners" she stated, 
Working for the WSPU she made speeches throughout the country, and used her family connections to campaign in Parliament. She wrote to the Home Secretary Herbert Gladstone asking for Emmeline Pankhurst and Christabel Pankhurst to be released from prison.
1909 – Imprisonment and self-mutilation in Holloway.
Constance Lytton was imprisoned in Holloway prison twice during 1909, after demonstrating at the House of Commons, but her ill health (a weak heart) meant that she spent most of her sentence in the infirmary. When the authorities discovered her identity, the daughter of Lord Lytton, they ordered her release. The British government were also aware that her health problems and hunger striking could lead to martyrdom. Infuriated by such inequality of justice she wrote to the "Liverpool Daily Post" in October 1909 to complain about the favourable treatment she had received.
On 24 February 1909, Lytton wrote to her mother about prison and reform in "Prisons and Prisoners" (Chapter III-"A Deputation to the Prime Minister"):
While she was imprisoned in Holloway Prison during March 1909 she started to mutilate her body. Her plan was to carve 'Votes for Women' from her breast to her cheek, so that it would always be visible. But after completing the "V" on her breast and ribs she requested sterile dressings to avoid blood poisoning, and her plan was aborted by the authorities.
Lytton wrote of the self-mutilation action in "Prisons and Prisoners" (Chapter VIII-"A Track to the Water's Edge"):
1909 – Imprisonment in Newcastle.
In October 1909 Constance Lytton was arrested for a second time in Newcastle. She had thrown a stone wrapped in paper bearing the message ‘To Lloyd George – Rebellion against tyranny is obedience to God – Deeds, not words’. Her message was in response to the government’s new policy of force-feeding imprisoned suffragettes who were on hunger strike.
1910 – Jane Warton in Liverpool, Walton gaol.
In January 1910, convinced that poorer prisoners were treated badly, Lytton travelled to Liverpool disguised as a working-class London seamstress named Jane Warton. She was arrested after an incident of rocks being thrown at an MP's car, imprisoned in Walton gaol for 14 days 'hard labour' and force-fed 8 times. After her release, although desperately weak, she wrote accounts of her experience for "The Times" and "Votes for Women" (the monthly journal of the WSPU, launched in 1907). She went on to lecture on the subject of her experience of the conditions which suffragette prisoners endured. It's thought that her speeches and letters helped to end the practice of force-feeding.
Constance Lytton wrote of the "Jane Warton" episode in "Prisons and Prisoners", (Chapter XII-Jane Warton) and (Chapter XIII-Walton Gaol, Liverpool: My Third Imprisonment).
Lytton's health continued to deteriorate and she suffered a heart attack in August 1910, and a series of strokes which paralysed the right side of her body. Undaunted, she used her left hand to write "Prisons and Prisoners" (1914), which became influential in prison reform.
1911 onwards.
In November 1911 Constance Lytton was imprisoned in Holloway for the fourth time, after breaking windows in the Houses of Parliament, or of a Post Office in Victoria Street, London. However conditions had improved ""all was civility; it was unrecognisable from the first time I had been there"" and suffragettes were treated as political prisoners.
After the WSPU ended its militant campaign at the outbreak of war in 1914, Lytton gave her support to Marie Stopes' campaign to establish birth control clinics.
In January 1918 parliament passed a bill giving women over 30 the vote.
Death and commemoration.
Constance Lytton never fully recovered from her prison treatment, heart attack and strokes, and was nursed at Knebworth by her mother until her death in 1923, aged 54. She was buried with the purple, white and green Suffragette colours laid on her coffin.
Winston Churchill.
Constance Lytton first met Winston Churchill while living in India, where he was a rival to her brother Victor for the hand of Pamela Chichele-Plowden.

30 Commando Information Exploitation Group

The 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a Royal Marines unit of the British Armed Forces. The unit resources include communications, information operations, information systems, intelligence, surveillance, and Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR).
It is a redesignation of the former brigade headquarters battalion, the UK Landing Force Command Support Group, which was previously known as HQ & Signals Squadron RM.
The unit's title harks back to the original 30 Commando (which in turn became 30 Assault Unit RM), formed in 1942. This unit was tasked to move ahead of advancing Allied forces, or to undertake covert infiltrations into enemy territory by land, sea or air, to capture much needed intelligence, in the form of codes, documents, equipment or enemy personnel.
In 2013, 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group were granted the freedom of Littlehampton, West Sussex, in honour of the original unit being based in the town during the Second World War.

How and Why Wonder Books

How and Why Wonder Books were a series of illustrated American books published in the 1960s and 1970s that was designed to teach science and history to children and young teenagers. The series began in 1960, and was edited under the supervision of Dr. Paul E. Blackwood of the Office of Education at the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The series was published by Wonder Books, Inc., a division of Grosset & Dunlap. 
Listing.
There were 74 unique titles in the series, each one starting with the phrase "The How and Why Wonder Book of…" as a key component of the book's name. All 74 volumes were published in a "softcover format", with pages measuring 8½ × 11 inches (21.6 × 27.9 cm) in size. A number of the titles were also produced in hardcover versions, too; these being referred to as either the "Trade Editions" or the "Library Editions." Each "How and Why Wonder Book" uniformly contained a total of 48 pages, with the only exception being "The Environment and You", which contained 64 pages.
The softcover books were numbered consecutively in series starting at 5001 (with the only exception being the final book in the series entitled "Fossils"). The hardcover versions were numbered differently from the softcover issues.
When publication of the "How and Why Wonder Book" series first commenced in 1960, only the initial six titles in the series were produced. As time went by, and as the series proved to be highly successful, more new titles were added to expand its scope.
At the same time, a handful of titles also "disappeared" from the comprehensive "checklists" (located on back covers) when these volumes were revised and republished under a different title and/or series number. Specifically, there were six titles that were removed from checklists when they were reissued with a later series number. They were:
Although some of the titles were not altered from earlier versions, both the cover artwork and the interior content were changed. Thus, it is easy to distinguish between the early versions and the latter issues by the cover art alone.
The first 69 books in the series were issued with beautifully illustrated cover art, otherwise referred to as "Painted Covers", during the 1960s. Later reprints in the 1970s, however, switched to "Photo Covers". In fact, four of the last five volumes in the series were only produced in a photo cover version ("Ecology, Extinct Animals, Snakes and Fossils"). Strangely enough, one the final five titles ("The Environment and You") was only issued in a painted cover, even though it was not released until the 1970s.
Because of the striking cover artwork, and thanks largely to the nostalgic appeal of these books, they have become collectable items once more today.
The Mystery of the Missing Series Numbers.
A mystery for collectors is the absence of How and Why Wonder Book volumes numbered 5074 or 5075. While it may well have been the original intent of publishers to fill in these missing gaps in the series sequence, this was never done. With the advent of the ISBN numbering system, the 5075 number was eventually assigned to a 1985 hardcover reprint of Earl Schenck Miers book "America and Its Presidents" (ISBN 0-448-05075-7). The ISBN number associated with number 5074 (ISBN 0-448-05074-9) has never been assigned.
How and Why Activity Books.
A matching series of activity books was released that contained mazes, puzzles and games about the subject they contained. Titles released in this series were:
Price Stern Sloan How and Why Editions.
Price Sterm Sloan took over the publication of the How and Why series and released many of the existing titles with new covers. In addition they added some new titles to the list:
The UK Series.
During the 1960s and 1970s, the "How and Why Wonder Book" series was concurrently published in the United Kingdom by Transworld Publishers of London. For the most part, both the cover artwork and the inner content of the UK volumes were identical to those of the U.S. publications. However, a handful of the UK versions contained either revised text and/or unique cover art. Many of these revisions were done to reflect European species (Birds, Insects) or to emphasize regional conditions.
The UK series was published using a completely different numbering sequence from the U.S. series (Dinosaurs is number 6501, Stars is 6503, etc.). Also, the UK version of "Extinct Animals" has a painted cover as opposed to the U.S. version's photo cover.
The following standard series titles were released in the UK by Transworld Publishers. Unless otherwise indicated, both the content and cover art used were identical to those of the American versions:
In addition to the foregoing, Transworld expanded the UK series with the release of the following new, unique titles:
Early editions of the UK volumes had a "checklist" on their back covers, similar to American copies. This format was used up until #6536 (Lady of the Lamp); released in 1967. However, soon thereafter, the format of the back cover was revised to show a photo of a random selection of some of the volumes available in the series.
In addition, Transworld published two How and Why BUMPER WONDER Books which were "puzzles, quizzes, jokes, amazing facts" using content and images from the various How and Why editions.
One feature of most UK editions of the How and Why books was that the back inner cover featured an advertisement for a "Collector's Binder" to hold your How and Why books. The ad read "The new How and Why collector binder holds 12 titles; a wonderful way to build your own reference library! It is available from the publishers of the How and Why books for only 16/-. Supplies are limited so send for yours now." This back inner cover advertisement was a standard feature for many years.
It also appears that four of the ISBN series numbers contained within the sequential Transworld numbering block were never assigned to volumes within the How and Why Wonder book series; these being volumes #6582 (ISBN 0-552-86582-6), #6588 (ISBN 0-552-86588-5), #6590 (ISBN 0-552-86590-7) and #6594 (ISBN 0-552-86594-x). An ISBN search of these numbers indicates that they were never assigned to published volumes.
Although the above lists are comprehensive for How and Why Wonder Book volumes published by Grosset & Dunlap and Transworld in the 1960s and 1970s, it should also be noted that certain volumes in the series continued to be published by Price Stern Sloan into the 1980s and that additional unique titles were added to the series. New How and Why Wonder Book titles included "Radiation," "Ships and Submarines," "Planet Earth," "Living Things," "Automobiles," "Motorcycles," "Space," "Robots," "Aircraft," and the "Solar System." None of these titles was available earlier than 1987 and thus they do not appear in the foregoing checklists.
Writers, illustrators and photographers.
Many individuals contributed to the How and Why Wonder Book series. They consisted of a wide spectrum of authors, artists and photographers. Some of these individuals contributed to several volumes in the How and Why Wonder Book series, while many others appeared on a one-time basis only.

Spotlight Wonder Books and the 7900 Series.
Closely associated with the "How and Why Wonder Book" series are two other series of softcover books produced by publisher Grosset and Dunlap in the 1960s under the "Wonder Books" banner. They are the "Spotlight Wonder Book" series and the otherwise nameless "7900" series.
"Spotlight Wonder Books".
The "Spotlight Wonder Book" series focused on famous people or institutions as opposed to science topics. They were identical to How and Why Wonder Books in terms of their size (8½ × 11 inches, or 21.6 × 27.9 cm) and the fact that they also contained the standard 48 pages. Titles included the following:
"The 7900 Series".

Rosita (film)

Rosita is a 1923 silent film directed by Ernst Lubitsch. The film is based upon an 1872 opera "Don César de Bazan" of Adolphe d'Ennery et Philippe Dumanoir.
Synopsis.
The film takes place in Seville, in a period where the city has sunk into the depths of depravity and sin. Shocked by the depths his people have sunk to, The king of Spain (Holbrook Blinn) decides to give the town a visit when a carnaval is organized in order to redeem it. One of its inhabitants is Rosita (Mary Pickford), a beloved street singer praised by the townspeople for her entertainment.
Rosita is the only source of income to her poor family, who are always fighting each other. She is fed up with living in extreme poverty, while the king is living in wealth. After being forced to pay taxes, Rosita is enraged and comes up with a song in which she insults the king. Soon, the king is informed with the offensive ballad and visits her anonymously. Instead of being angry, he is charmed by the woman. However, the soldiers have come to arrest her for publicly insulting the king.
While being taken to prison, Don Diego (George Walsh) tries to defend her. Instead of convincing the soldiers to set her free, however, he is arrested as well. They fall in love at the police station, but she is unaware Diego is a powerful captain. By the king's request, Rosita is set free and escorted to his castle. Diego, however, is told he will be hung. When she meets him, Rosita doesn't believe he is the king. He tries to seduce her, but she isn't impressed until he offers her fashionable clothes. She doesn't want to have anything to do with him, but is pressured into giving in on his advances by her family, who see an opportunity on becoming wealthy.
Living a luxurious live in the castle, the family still feels disrespected. Rosita's mother (Mathilde Comont) demands for her daughter to have a noble husband, and the king offers her to be married to Diego. Rosita's mother is pleased, not knowing he will be sentenced to death shortly after the wedding. Diego is manipulated into participating by the offer of being shot like a respectable soldier, rather than hanged. At the wedding, they are married with their eyes covered, thus not knowing who they will be married to. The king's plan fails when Rosita breaks the rules and looks at her future husband.
Rosita is shocked to learn her new husband is Diego, who is sent back to jail immediately. Rosita convinces the king to set Diego free. However, when she leaves, the king again orders the guards to kill Diego. Meanwhile, the queen (Irene Rich) has found out about his new fling and is furious.
Soon afterward, Rosita is informed that Diego has been executed. Devastated, she attempts to kill the king until she and the king find out Diego is still alive, and the lovers are reunited. The king leaves his castle to be confronted by his wife about his affair. She reveals she ordered the guards to spare Diego.
Production.
Prior to this movie, Mary Pickford mostly appeared in features portraying children. Pickford appealed to a fan magazine for new film ideas, and the magazine's contributors wrote back that they wanted to see her play more child roles, such as Cinderella. Pickford thanked them and promptly set out to make a film with an adult role.
In 1922, her studio United Artists was not making any profits, despite releasing successful films such as "Broken Blossoms", "Little Lord Fauntleroy" (1921) and "Robin Hood" (1922). Pickford was desperate to release a film which could perform well and free her of her image as an ingenue.
Realizing Hollywood was making profits and costume movies, such as "When Knighthood Was in Flower" she decided to make a film based on the 1902 novel "Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall". She chose Ernst Lubitsch as her director and brought him over from Germany in October 1922 to meet with her.
Lubitsch decided he could not make "Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall". Pickford was annoyed, since she had already paid $250,000 on its preparations (and would eventually film the story later on). They looked for another story to make a movie out of, ultimately choosing "Faust". However, the project was dropped when Pickford's mother, Charlotte Hennessy, overheard Lubitsch discussing the baby killing scene and immediately nixed the idea. Lubitsch and Pickford eventually decided to film the opera "Don César de Bazan", retitling it as "Rosita". Lubitsch hesitated about making it, but Pickford eventually convinced him to work on the project.
Pickford wanted Ramón Novarro to co-star opposite her as Don Diego. Rex Ingram, Navarro's mentor, protested to this offer, reminding Novarro that Pickford once stated that Novarro's "face and body do not match". Novarro followed Ingram's advice and rejected the role.
Lubitsch later said working with Pickford was a delight. Pickford also enjoyed working with Lubitsch, and at first contracted him to make three more movies with her.
Reception and release.
After its release, the film became a huge success, earning over $1,000,000. The movie was praised by both the critics and the audience. It eventually made profits for the studio.
However, for reasons unknown Pickford decided the film was a failure. She wanted the prints destroyed, and when she handed her films over for preservation she refused to hand over "Rosita". However, another print was found.

Emmanuel Le Borgne (1610 – 5 August 1675) was the governor of Acadia 1657–67 and was the claimant to the estate of Charles de Menou d'Aulnay who had governed Acadia at a previous time.
Le Borgne was a highly successful merchant in France and had financed d’Aulnay in his Acadian trade. When d’Aulnay died by drowning, Le Borgne laid formal claim to the estate. He then sent an expedition to Acadia the next year to attempt a monopoly of the trade and secure the money owed to him. His competition was Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour at Saint John and Nicolas Denys at Cape Breton. In 1653, along with raiding Pentagouet (Castine, Maine), LaHave, Nova Scotia, and Nipisguit (Bathurst, New Brunswick), Emmanuel Le Borgne with 100 men also raided Saint-Pierre. Denys was taken prisoner and returned to France.

Iowa Army Ammunition Plant

The mission of the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAP), located in Des Moines County in southeastern Iowa, near the city of Burlington, is to manufacture and deliver large caliber items for the Department of Defense using modern production methods in support of worldwide operations.
Capabilities.
Capabilities of the center include: load, assemble and pack for a full range of munitions and high explosive components; tank ammunition (105 mm; 120 mm); high explosive artillery; large caliber mortars (81 mm; 120 mm); insensitive munitions; smart munitions mines/scatterable mines; missile assembly/missile warheads; rocket assisted projectiles; detonators; development; pressed and cast warheads; and testing.
History.
The IAAP was established in November 1940, as the Iowa Ordnance Plant and started
production in 1941. Production was stopped in 1945, when WWII ended. In 1947, the US Atomic Energy Commission assumed responsibility. The plant resumed its ammunition manufacturing mission in 1949. In 1950, in response to the Korean War, production increased dramatically. During these years it was known as the Burlington Atomic Energy Commission Plant (BAECP). The Burlington AEC Plant did final assembly on nuclear weapons until 1975, when assembly was consolidated at Pantex. In 1975, responsibility for the IAAP reverted to the Army.
Facilities.
IAAP is housed on with 767 buildings, 282 igloos and storage capacity of . It also has of roads and of railroads. The facilities are located within the townships of Union Township, Danville Township, Flint River Township, and the southern part of the small city of Middletown, Iowa, all in Des Moines County.
BRAC 2005.
IAAP had gained the 105 mm and 155 mm artillery and the shoulder-launched multi-purpose assault weapon missile warhead workload from the Kansas Army Ammunition Plant. It also had gained the “family of scatterable mines” and the detonator workload from the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant. Both of these facilities were closed due to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission.

Agaricus abruptibulbus

Agaricus abruptibulbus is a species of mushroom in the genus "Agaricus". It is commonly known as the abruptly-bulbous agaricus or the flat-bulb mushroom. First described by the mycologist Charles Horton Peck, this bulbous-stemmed edible species smells slightly of anise, and turns yellow when bruised or cut. The mushroom is medium-sized, with a white, yellow-staining cap on a slender stipe that has a wide, flat bulb on the base
Taxonomy and classification.
The species was originally named as "Agaricus abruptus" by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1900. In his 1904 "Report of the State Botanist" publication, he changed the name to "Agaricus abruptibulbus". He explained that Elias Magnus Fries had earlier named a species in the subgenus "Flammula", which he called "Agaricus abruptus"; the subgenus was later raised to the rank of genus, and the species was given the name "Flammula abruptus". Under the transitioning nomenclatural conventions of the time, it was unclear if "Agaricus abruptus" would remain available for use, so he changed the name.
"Agaricus abruptibulbus" belongs in the Arvenses clade of the genus "Agaricus" (along with species "A. silvicola", "A. arvensis", and "A. semotus").
Some American authors consider this species to be synonymous with "A. silvicola", while some in Europe have synonymized it with the similar species "A. essettei". American mycologists Steve Trudell and Joseph Ammirati noted in a 2009 field guide: "The name "A. abruptibulbus" has been applied to forms with bulbous stipe bases, but variation in stipe shape is so great that the use of this name has been largely abandoned."
Description.
The cap is up to in diameter, convex in shape, sometimes with an umbo, and whitish in color. After being scratched or bruised, the cap turns yellow. The stipe is long by thick and bulbous. A large, white annular ring is present on the stipe. The gill attachment is free, and the color is initially grayish but turns brownish after the spores are developed. Specimens smell slightly of anise. The spore print is brown to purple-brown. Spores are elliptical in shape, and are 6–8 by 4–5 µm. The surface of the cap will stain yellow if a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide is applied.
Similar species.
"Agaricus silvicola" is very similar in appearance and also grows in woodlands, but it may be distinguished by the lack of an abruptly bulbous base. "Agaricus arvensis" has a more robust stature, lacks the bulbous base, and grows in grassy open areas like meadows and fields. It has larger spores than "A. abruptibulbus", typically 7.0–9.2 by 4.4–5.5 µm.
Cadmium bioaccumulation.
"Agaricus abruptibulbus" is known to bioaccumulate the toxic element cadmium—in other words, it absorbs cadmium faster than it loses it—so specimens collected in the wild often have higher concentrations of this element than the soil in which they are found.

Temple, Cornwall

Temple () is a small village in the parish of Blisland on Bodmin moor, Cornwall, UK. The village is bypassed by the A30 road.
History and antiquities.
Temple derives its name from the hospice founded by Knights Templars who built a refuge for pilgrims and travellers, en route to the Holy Land, in the 12th century. On the suppression of the Templars it passed into the hands of the Knights Hospitallers (in 1314), who held it until the religious houses were suppressed by Henry VIII. In 1934, the parish of Temple was incorporated into Blisland parish. 
Church.
Temple Church is a Grade II* listed building built c.1120 on land owned by the Knights Templar. It became famous as a place where marriages could be performed without banns or licence (similar to Gretna Green until the early 20th century). This came to an end in 1744 when the church first came under episcopal jurisdiction. By the mid 19th century, it had become a ruin and was rebuilt (by Silvanus Trevail) in 1883. The church is dedicated to St Catherine.
Crosses.
Langdon (1896) recorded the existence of eight stone crosses in the parish, including two cross slabs, all in the churchyard.

Santa Brigida (Rome)

Santa Brigida is a convent church dedicated to St Bridget of Sweden and the Swedish national church in Rome. It was also known as "Santa Brigida a Campo de' Fiori" since it was built on what was then part of Campo de' Fiori but is now the urbanistically distinct Piazza Farnese.
History.
A first building rose during the pontificate of Boniface IX (1389–1404) but was later abandoned. In 1513, Peder Månsson, later (1524) Bishop of Västerås in Sweden, erected a new church. It was officially granted to the Bishop of Uppsala by Pope Paul III (1534–1549). 
It was restored in the early 18th century by Pope Clement XI (1700–1721). 
In 1828, Pope Leo XII gave the convent and church to the Canons of Santa Maria in Trastevere. They did not have the means to restore it, and gave it to the Congregation of Holy Cross, a French congregation, in 1855. They restored the church and the rooms of St Bridget in 1857-1858.
The next owner was a Polish branch of the Carmelite Order, to whom the convent and church was given in 1889. They held it until 1930, when it was returned to the Bridgittine Order.
The paintings in the church were restored before the Bridgittine jubilee of 1991.
Exterior.
The façade was constructed in 1705 and adorned with statues of "St Brigid" and her daughter "St Catherine" by Andrea Fucigna. Minor changes, such as the shapes of the windows, were made in the 19th century.
The design of the neo-romanesque bell-tower, added in 1894, is attributed to the architect Raffaele Ingami who carried out much consolidation work for the convent at the time.
Interior.
There are two marble holy water fonts. On the right-hand one may be seen the lily of the Farnese family, placed here when Cardinal Odoardo Farnese was the protector of the convent, 1601-1626. The one on the left side has the arms of the Carmelite Order. Another protector was Cardinal Virginio Orsini whose coat of arms can be seen on a marble bowl in the sacristy.
In the early 18th century the church was embellished with six paintings "Scenes from the Life of St Bridget" by Biagio Puccini, executed between 1702 and 1705.
Circa 1709-1711, Puccini also painted the large ceiling fresco. In its centre is "The Glory of St Bridget" which is clearly influenced by the large marble relief of "The Glory of St Catherine of Siena" by Melchiorre Cafà from the 1660s. 
There are three recently discovered memorial plaques in the church. They are not in their original positions. Two of them, one by the entrance to the Chapel of St Richard and one by the sacristy door, must have been in Bridget's room, and the third was probably placed on the façade until the new church was built in the 16th century.
Chapel of St Richard.
Near the entrance are two doors. One leads to the Chapel of St Richard, the other to the new sacristy (1894). The chapel was built in 1894 on Neo-Gothic style by Raffaele Ingami. It is dedicated to an English Bridgittine monk, Richard Reynolds, who was martyred in London in 1535. He is considered the most important martyr of the order. The chapel was originally dedicated to "Our Lady of Sorrows", and an inscription from this period has been preserved on the altar. On the walls are eight paintings of scenes from the life of the "Blessed Virgin", made by Eugenio Cisterna.
On the right-hand side is the cenotaph of Nils Karlsson Bielke (died 1765) by Tommaso Righi. He was a descendant of one of St Bridget's brothers. After converting to Catholicism he lived in exile in Rome, and was made a senator. His place of burial is unknown.
Also on the right-hand side is the "Altar of Our Lady". The painting by Virginio Monti, depicting "Mary and the Holy Child" in a classical landscape scene, was made in the 19th century. It is a copy of a lost original by Annibale Carracci.
Opposite this altar is the "Altar of St Catherine of Sweden". It was redecorated in 1894. The painting, made in that year, is by Eugenio Cisterna, a pupil of Virginio Monti. It originally depicted "St Bridget and St Teresa of Avila", but when the church was given to the Bridgittine Sisters in 1930, the figure of St Teresa was altered to represent St Catherine.
Chapel of St Catherine.
In the crypt is the Chapel of St Catherine, which was dedicated in 1972. It has 70 seats, and is used by the Church of Sweden. Lutheran services are held on Sundays and Thursdays.
Convent.
The church is part of the convent of the Bridgettine Sisters. The convent building was owned by Francesca Papazurri, who became a close friend of St Bridget during the Holy Year of 1350. It was at that time known as the "Palatium Magnum", The Grand Palace. Bridget lived there for 19 years, and her rooms have been preserved. After Bridget's death, the house was donated to the order's mother house in Vadstena, and it was used as a hospice for Swedish pilgrims and clergy visiting Rome.
In the 16th century, the Reformation brought radical changes. The convent became a refuge for Swedish Catholics who chose exile rather than conversion. Among those who lived here in this period was Johannes Magnus (1488–1544), the last Catholic Archbishop of Sweden. Olaus Magnus arrived in 1549, and set up a printing press in the house. He published the revelations of St Bridget from this press in 1557. As the mother house in Vadstena was suppressed, a cardinal was made protector of the convent. During her exile from 1673 until her death in 1689, Queen Christina of Sweden was its protectress.
The building was restored by Pope Clement XI (1700–1721). Since then, only minor changes have been made to the exterior.
It is possible to visit the rooms of St Bridget and her daughter St Catherine, first abbess of the Bridgettine Sisters. The rooms contain relics of the two saints, and are decorated with paintings from the lives of the saints. Chapels of St Bridget and St Catherine have been installed in their respective rooms.

Oregon Land Conservation and Development Act of 1973

The Oregon Land Conservation and Development Act of 1973, formally Oregon Senate Bills 100 and 101 of 1973 (SB 100 and SB 101), were pieces of landmark legislation passed by the Oregon State Senate in 1973 and later signed into law. It created a framework for land use planning across the state, requiring every city and county to develop a comprehensive plan for land use.
SB 100 expanded on Senate Bill 10 (SB 10) of 1969. This legislation created the Oregon Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC), which expanded on the statewide planning goals of SB 10. It also established the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development.
Planning goals.
By 1976, the planning goals laid out by the act numbered 19:
Attempts to repeal.
An attempt to repeal SB 100 was launched as early as 1976. In an editorial, the "Eugene Register-Guard" asserted its staff had attended many of the legislative hearings leading to the bills' passage, and that it was "too early to talk about a repeal of Senate Bill 100, when it hardly a chance to work." The initiative petition succeeded in putting Measure 10 on the November ballot, but the measure was the first of many repeal attempts to fail in subsequent decades. The Central Lane County League of Women Voters published a booklet on land use planning that year.
In 2000, Measure 7 passed, but was later overturned by the Oregon Supreme Court; 2004's Measure 37 also passed, but its impacts were lessened with 2007's Measure 49.

San Tommaso in Parione

San Tommaso in Parione is one of the two national churches of Ethiopia in Rome. It is dedicated to St Thomas the Apostle. The church is normally open to the public only between 20 and 28 September.
History.
The church has ancient origins, but the first documented date is 1139, when Pope Innocent II consecrated it. It seems certain that this was a reconsecration after a rebuilding or enlargement of the church. In 1449, Pope Nicholas V granted the church to the Company of Scriptors and Copyists of the Curia. St Philip Neri was ordained to the priesthood in the church in 1551. 
The present church is the result of a rebuilding in 1582. It was built to a design by Francesco Volterra by Mario and Camillo Cerrini. It was made a titular church in 1517. This status was kept until 1937, when Pope Pius XI suppressed its status due to the state of disrepair the church was in; the title had then been vacant since 1914. The title was transferred to Chiesa Nuova. The church is served by the Cistercian Order. As it is also the national church of Ethiopia, and Mass is celebrated according to both Latin and Alexandrine (Coptic) rite.
Architecture.
The 16th century brick façade was designed by Jacopo del Duca. It has two stories, with the lower divided into three sections. The middle section has a doorway crowned by a triangular tympanon, and the outer sections have windows. On the upper level is a central window crowned by a rounded tympanon. The middle section is crowned by a tympanon; the outer sections consist only of volutes.
Interior
The nave has three aisles separated by pilasters with Ionic capitals. The nave has a visible tile roof, while the outer aisles have plaster ceilings. The high altar, set against the apse wall, has two marble columns on the sides and is crowned by a tympanon. The 17th century altarpiece depicts St Thomas. On the sides are paintings of Cardinal Gregorio Barbarigo and St Philip Neri. The latter was ordained in this church.
On the left wall are frescoes from the pontificate of Innocent II (1130–1143). One of them depicts "St Martin of Tours Dividing his Cloak". There are also paintings from the 19th century, of which "The Annunciation" by Giuseppe Passeri is the most notable.

St Stephen of the Abyssinians () is a Roman Catholic church located in Vatican City. The church dedicated to Stephen the Protomartyr is the national church of Ethiopia. The liturgy is celebrated according to the Alexandrine rite of the Ethiopian Catholic Church. It is the oldest surviving church in the Vatican.
History.
The church was built by Pope Leo I (ca. 400–461), and named "Santo Stefano Maggiore". It stands above the ruins of a pagan temple dedicated to Vesta. It was originally built as a circular building with twenty Corinthian columns, which is a common plan for a temple of Vesta.
It was rebuilt in 1159 under Pope Alexander III, who also built a monastery for Ethiopian monks next to it.
In 1479, Pope Sixtus IV restored the church and assigned it to the Coptic monks in the city. It was at this time that the name was changed to reflect that it was served by Ethiopians (Abyssinian). It was altered under Pope Gregory XI (1700–1721), and again in 1928.
Exterior.
The façade is in the style of the early 18th century. The 12th century doorway, decorated with the "Lamb and the Cross", has been preserved.
Interior.
The church has a single nave with ancient columns along the sides. The most important work of art is a fresco of the "Madonna with Child" in the Roman style from the 15th century.
Liturgy.
The Feast of St. Stephen is celebrated with great solemnity on 26 December.

Hirsch Glick (1922 Vilna, Lithuania – 1944 Estonia) was a Jewish poet and partisan.
Glick was born in Vilna in 1922. He began to write Yiddish poetry in his teens and became co-founder of "Yungvald" (Young Forest), a group of young Jewish poets. After the German assault on Soviet Union in 1941, Hirsh Glick was imprisoned in the Weiße Wache concentration camp and later transferred to Vilna Ghetto. Glick involved himself in the ghetto's artistic community while simultaneously participating in the underground and took part in the 1942 ghetto uprising. In 1943 he wrote his most famous work, the song "Zog nit keynmol, az du geyst dem letstn veg" (זאג ניט קיינמאל, אז דו גייסט דעם לעצטן וועג), which became the anthem of the Jewish partisan movement, and "Shtil, di nakht iz oysgeshternt". He was inspired to write this work by news that arrived of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.Glick managed to flee when the ghetto was being liquidated in October 1943, but was re-captured. He was later deported to a concentration camp in Estonia. During his captivity he continued to compose songs and poems. In July 1944, with the Soviet Army approaching, Glick escaped. He was never heard from again, and was presumed captured and executed by the Germans (reportedly in August 1944).

British Universities Karting Championship

The British Universities Karting Championship (BUKC) is an annual University-based kart racing competition in the United Kingdom, organised by 3T Racing Ltd in association with Club100 Racing Ltd.
The BUKC.
The British Universities Karting Championship (BUKC) is a nation wide high performance 2-stroke karting championship for university students across the UK. It is contested every year during February to April by more than 200 students at each and every race day.
It is organised by 3T Racing Ltd in association with Club100 Racing Ltd. 3T Racing Ltd is a small privately owned company run by Will Tew in order to run the BUKC.
History.
Will Tew of 3T Racing Ltd started karting in 2000 aged 19 whilst at Imperial College, London. Back then Imperial College owned a fleet of 2-stroke TKMs and Rotax Max karts which they would take out for fun on weekends to circuits such as Tilbury, Rye House, Clay Pigeon, Whilton Mill and Lydd Raceway.
Will was obsessed by these immensely powerful karts and even though the Inter University Karting Championship (IUKC), as it was known back then, was run on lesser powered 4-strokes, Will was desperate to race for his university. Alas, no one at Imperial wanted to race in the IUKC because it was all 4-stroke kart based (thunderkarts, pro-karts and indoor hire karts).
The IUKC 2002
The IUKC was to be organised in 2002 by Nottingham university once again on 4-strokes.
However Will had just found Club 100 - a company that supplies a fleet of 2-stroke TKM-engined karts - and started racing in their national sprint championships. Will immediately got in touch with John Vigor from Club100 with a view to setting up a university karting championship on Club100's 2-stroke TKM-engined karts.
Will teamed up with Tom Batho, also from Imperial College's Karting Society, to successfully launch the 2-stroke, Club100, version of the IUKC for 2002.
The 4-stroke based IUKC was dropped by Nottingham as everyone jumped on board the new championship run by Will, Tom and Club100 through Imperial College Union.
The IUKC 2002 became the first ever uni karting championship to be run on 2-stroke machinery and was contested by 32 teams, over 4 rounds. It was won by Loughborough A.
The BUKC 2003
For the 2003 championship, Will and Tom introduced a 5th round and a new format and renamed the championship to the British Universities Karting Championship (BUKC).
Most importantly they realised that the best thing for the championship was not for it to passed on to different universities each year, but to keep consistency in the management of the championships and the relationship with Club100 strong.
The Birth of 3T Racing Ltd
For this reason Will and Tom setup 3T Racing Ltd in November 2003 to continue organising the BUKC and to implement other ideas such as the British Schools Karting Championship (BSKC).
After graduation, Will worked for the Swiss investment bank UBS in their IT department. Along with being responsible for the development and management of a billion-dollar-a-week trading platform, Will continued to run the BUKC successfully in his spare time.
Since then the BUKC has grown to 62 teams from 38 universities, contesting across North and South regional qualifications then into a 7 round championship over 4 race days.
The relationship with Club100 is as strong as ever and is indicated strongly by the fact that the price per round is no greater than it was in 2003.
3T Racing Ltd in the future
In mid-2006 Will took a little leap of faith by resigning from UBS to concentrate fully on his plans for the BUKC and BSKC.
It is now Will's mission now to see that karting is considered a national sport within all secondary schools across the country through the BSKC and to see that BUKC is contested by every university too.
Format.
The BUKC uses a unique format that uses teams of 4 drivers and takes place over a number of rounds during the academic year at many top class karting venues throughout the UK.
2 different formats are used in the BUKC:
The Sprint Format:
The Sprint Format is where every driver in the team gets to race in their own individual 25 minute race. No fuel stops, no driver changes. Just a 25 minute sprint to the flag.
The teams finishing score for the round is determined by adding up the best 3 results from the 4 sprint races.
The Endurance Format:
The Endurance Format is where the team (of 4 drivers) is split into 2 teams of 2. Each mini-team of 2 drivers races in a one-hour race.
2 fuel stops must be made, and at least one driver change must be made.
The teams finishing score for the round is determined by adding up the points from both the 2 one-hour races.
Karts.
The BUKC are supplied with Club100 Racing Ltd karts for the championship, these are 115cc (as of 2009) 2-stroke TKM engines that are capable of speeds around 70 mph. The racing is always very competitive and the rivalry between each university makes it an exciting championship for students to become involved in.
Many up and coming young stars are taking part in the BUKC alongside their studies and being as it is a non MSA championship it is a great opportunity for others who have never raced karts to take part alongside them. Racing drivers to have appeared in the BUKC include Alex Brundle and British GT class champion James Gornall.
Universities Taking Part.
The championship is open to teams from any UK institution of higher education. Each university may be represented by more than one team of four drivers; Loughborough University fielded three teams in 2008.
Loughborough University and Oxford Brookes University are the most successful teams in the championship's history, with 4 titles each to their name. The series is most popular among universities in the south of England; however Wales are well represented, with Cardiff and Swansea taking part, Swansea Metropolitan came 2nd overall in 2009. The north of England are also well represented. In 2009 Edinburgh became the first Scottish team to take part in the championships, Heriot-Watt with Keith Wilson as the team captain followed in 2010. It is widely accepted that the combination of Steve Hicks and Dave Robinson was the most successful BUKC endurance pairing with over a 90% win rate in 4 seasons together.

History.
Loni is a warrior branch of Durrani Pashtoons and are related to Qarabagh of Afghanistan. They came to the sub-continent in the era of the Afghan emperor Ahmad Shah Durrani. They were then called as "OX" due to their warrior nature. A huge population of Luni tribe still exists in the Uttar Pradesh District of India.
They moved through Kashmir, Tank, Dera Ismail Khan, and Musa Khel to Khan Muhammad Kot and from there they attacked Alambar, Lakhi, Samaolang (Chamalung) and Thal Chutiali and got hold of the vast area, which then got a single name “LONI”. The boundaries of Loni are extended to Kohlu, Musa Khel, Barkhan, Loralai and Dukki.
They have fought several decisive wars against neighboring castes like MARRI, KAKAR and other tribes of the area!

Environmental politics

Environmental politics is an academic field of study focused on three core components:
Neil Carter, in his foundational text "Politics of the Environment" (2009), suggests that "environmental" politics is distinct in at least two ways: first, "it has a primary concern with the relationship between human society and the natural world" (p. 3); and second, "unlike most other single issues, it comes replete with its own ideology and political movement" (p. 5, drawing on Michael Jacobs, ed., "Greening the Millenium?", 1997).
Further, he distinguishes between modern and earlier forms of environmental politics, in particular conservationism and preservationism. Contemporary environmental politics "was driven by the idea of a global ecological crisis that threatened the very existence of humanity." And "modern environmentalism was a political and activist mass movement which demanded a radical transforamtion in the values and structures of society."
