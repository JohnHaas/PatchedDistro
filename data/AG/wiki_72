The Sweet Ride

The Sweet Ride (1968) is an American counter-culture drama with a few surfer/biker exploitation film elements. It stars Anthony Franciosa, Michael Sarrazin and Jacqueline Bisset in an early starring role. The film also features Bob Denver in the role of Choo-Choo, a Beatnik piano-playing draft dodger. Sarrazin and Bisset were nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer, Male and Female respectively.
"The Sweet Ride" was directed by Harvey Hart and written by Tom Mankiewicz, based on a 1967 novel of the same name by William Murray (d. March 2005), a native of New York City, who had moved to southern California in 1966. 
Plot.
The story, told in flashbacks, concerns a middle-aged tennis bum (Franciosa) who shares a beach house with Sarrazin and Denver. Their carefree life becomes complicated, and later turns tragic, after they become involved with a mysterious young woman (Bisset) and a biker gang.
The San Francisco rock and roll band Moby Grape contributed to the soundtrack, and appeared, credited, in the film, performing the song "Never Again" in a Sunset Strip nightclub called the Tarantula. Other famous Sunset Strip locations include Gazzarri's and Scandia, as well as location filming in Malibu, according to reviews of the film.
Dusty Springfield sings "Sweet Ride" over the film's credits.
Production.
Jacqueline Bisset was cast on the basis of her short appearance in "Two for the Road". By the time "The Sweet Ride" was released she had been cast in "The Detective" and "Bullitt".
Tom Mankiewicz, who wrote the screenplay, later said the problem with the film was "it tried to touch all the bases at once: drama, comedy, porn, dropouts, surfing, true love, a touch a perversion, and the general malaise of 1960s young people. Frankie Avalon and Annette it definitely wasn't."
Mankiewicz also says producer Joe Pasternak had suffered a stroke shortly before filming which impacted his effectiveness.

Disillusion (ABBA song)

"Disillusion" is a ballad by pop group ABBA, released on their 1973 debut album Ring Ring. It is notable for being the only song ABBA recorded to feature a song-writing credit from Agnetha Faltskog. She, unlike Frida, was a songwriter as well as a singer, and had dabbled in that in her pre-ABBA career. She wrote the music, with lyrics added by fellow ABBA member Bjorn.
Writing.
Although she wrote several Swedish top 40 hits during her solo career, she didn't feel her compositions were suitable for ABBA's albums. However, although this is her only songwriting credit to appear on an ABBA album, she also co-wrote a songs ABBA performed in concert "I'm Still Alive"; Recordings of this often appears in bootlegs. The song itself is a folk-pop based ballad somewhat similar to her pre-ABBA solo work.
Composition.
This is Agnetha's first track where she has exclusive lead vocal, and her only until The Winner Takes It All in 1980 (the 1976 song My Love, My Life has backing vocals by Frida). The track has "sparse instrumentation", and the song has no harmonies from other ABBA members. This is different to the Swedish version she recorded for her 1975 solo album Elva Kvinnor I Ett Hus (Eleven Women In One House). The song was produced by Agnetha and entitled Mina Ogon; it was "far more ambitious".

Vladimir Weisberg

Vladimir Grigoryevich Weisberg (Владимир Григорьевич Вейсберг) (1924 - 1985) was a Jewish Russian painter and theoritician of art.
Weisberg argued that the problems of colourism the way they existed after Cézanne have been exhausted and that the color unsaturated by semi-color carried very little information: any coloristic complexity is the result of the pigment differentiation. In 1960, Weisberg created a table of the major types of coloristic perception, their signs and structures.
Weisberg art tries to find the synchronicity between semitone, composition, and drawing. His works are exhibited at the Tretyakov Gallery, the Pushkin Museum of Fine Art and many other Russian and foreign museums. Most of his canvasses are scattered among various private collections.

Gershom Sizomu

Gershom Sizomu (born 1972) is a Ugandan rabbi serving the Abayudaya, a Baganda community in eastern Uganda near the town of Mbale who practice Judaism. Sizomu is the first native-born black rabbi in Sub-Saharan Africa. He is also the first chief rabbi of Uganda.
Childhood.
Sizomu was born into an Abayudaya family, and his grandfather was the community’s leader. The Abayudaya were persecuted during the years of the Idi Amin regime, when it was illegal to openly practice the Jewish faith in Uganda. During his childhood, Sizomu’s father was arrested for building a sukkah as part of the celebration of the Jewish holiday Sukkot. His father was released when Sizomu’s family paid the arresting officer with a ransom of five goats. In 1979, following the overthrow of the Amin government, freedom of religion was restored in Uganda, and Sizomu’s family celebrated by hosting 200 people in a Passover Seder consisting of homemade matzoh and macco, a Ugandan banana wine with an 80 per cent alcohol content.
Education.
The Abayudaya was not recognized by the government of Israel as being Jewish because the community had not formally converted to Judaism. In 2003, Sizomu sought Israeli approval of the Abayudaya by inviting four U.S. rabbis to conduct a conversion ceremony for 300 Abayudaya Jews, which they did in 2003, in a ceremony consisting of the question, 'Why do you want to be Jewish?', to which the Abayudaya responded: "I was born Jewish and I'd like to stay Jewish." Others refused to take part saying: "We're already Jewish." Sizomu has openly identified himself as a Zionist and once stated in an interview: “If the Arab world declared war on Israel, we would fight and die to protect it.”
Sizomu earned a Bachelor of Arts in education from Islamic University in Uganda. As a Be'chol Lashon Rabbinic Fellow at the Institute for Jewish & Community Research, he came to the U.S. to 2003 to study in a five-year graduate program at the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies at the American Jewish University in Los Angeles. He graduated in 2008 and was ordained as a rabbi under the auspices of Conservative Judaism.
Rabbinical activities.
In July 2008, Sizomu returned to Uganda and conducted a conversion ceremony for 250 people at the village of Nabogoya, with converts coming from across Uganda and from Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. During the ceremony, Sizomu stressed the viability of the Jewish faith for sub-Saharan Africans by noting, “The relationship between God and the Jews in the Torah resonates for many spiritual seekers. It is important that Africans and others know that they can choose Judaism as a spiritual path and that we are open to them."
Political Activities.
Rabbi Sizomu was a candidate to represent Uganda's Bungokho North District in Parliament in the 2011 election, held on February 18, 2011.

Fort Sinquefield

Fort Sinquefield is the historic site of a wooden stockade fortification in Clarke County, Alabama, near the modern town of Grove Hill. It was built by early Clarke County pioneers as protection during the Creek War and was attacked in 1813 by Creek warriors. 
A marker was erected at the site by Clarke County school children in 1931 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 1974.
History.
At the time of the Creek War, originally a civil war within the Creek nation, Clarke was a newly formed county in the Mississippi Territory. The Creek were divided between traditionalists in the Upper Towns and those who had adopted more European-American customs in the Lower Towns. Chiefs of the towns disagreed about the uses of communal land and other issues. The first hostilities of the war that involved Americans occurred nearby during the Battle of Burnt Corn, where white militia attacked the Red Sticks on July 27, 1813. 
The next month, the Red Sticks on August 30, 1813 attacked Fort Mims, garrisoned by the Tensaw Creek. The Red Sticks believed the Tensaw had left behind core Creek values. They killed most of the several hundred people assembled inside Fort Mims, who included Lower Town Creek, intermarried whites and slaves, and other settlers, in an event that became known as the Fort Mims massacre.
Fort Sinquefield was used as a refuge by several pioneer families and friendly Lower Creek after the attack on Fort Mims. On September 1, 1813, Red Sticks warriors led by Josiah Francis, a.k.a. Prophet Francis, attacked the Ransom Kimbell and Abner James families, who had left the crowded fort for Kimbell's cabin nearby. Most of the men escaped back to the fort, but twelve women and children were killed and scalped in what became known as the Kimbell-James Massacre. The bodies were retrieved for burial outside the fort the next day. 
The Red Sticks attacked a second time that day, catching several woman who were washing clothes at a spring away from the fort. They attempted to cut the women off from the fort, but were thwarted by settlers who released their 60 dogs from the fort. The Creek killed one woman, Sarah Phillips. The other settlers gained the fort, from where they fired at the Red Sticks. Casualties of the conflict included several warriors as well as the settler Stephen Lacey. The attack lasted two hours before the Red Sticks retreated. The survivors abandoned Sinquefield soon after, moving to the larger Fort Madison, several miles to the south.

Samaha specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise sought out stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha's approach made waves in Hollywood, earning him a reputation of being able to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the larger studios. His unorthodox deals raised eyebrows and the entertainment industry magazine "Variety" commented that they were "often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders scratching their heads".

Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute

Baker IDI Heart And Diabetes Institute was formed by the 2009 merger of two separate organisations, the Baker Heart Research Institute (BHRI) and the International Diabetes Institute (IDI).
History.
The Baker Heart Research Institute.
The Baker Heart Research Institute was established in 1926 in Melbourne with financial support from Mr Thomas Baker, his wife Alice Baker and her sister Ms Eleanor Shaw and was a major collaboration with the Alfred Hospital. Its first Director was Dr W S Penfold, who served in that role until 1938. The first Director of the IDI was Professor Paul Zimmet and he held that position until the merger in 2008. He is now Director Emeritus, Director International Research, in Baker IDI.
JF Mackeddie, a pathologist originally from Scotland, but who practised in Melbourne in the early 20th Century, became a close friend of Thomas Baker through being neighbours on land south of the city. Mackeddie was “concerned with the science of diseases and the need to apply the advancing knowledge of biological science to human illness…” After convincing Baker to donate funds, firstly to the Alfred Hospital and then for research, he went on to become one of the founding Trustees of the Baker Medical Research Institute. Mackeddie recruited AB (Basil) Corkill as a biochemist for the new Institute. The salary was paid by Thomas Baker.
"The only consistent basic research in relation to diabetes and carbohydrate metabolism in the 20 years from 1925 was carried out at the Baker Institute in Melbourne" F.I.R. Martin
The initial project dealt with new techniques for diagnosing diseases of the nervous system, in particular, the changes in cell 
content and chemistry of cerebro-spinal fluid in various diseases. Other projects in the early days involved bacteriology, at the time the Institute was started, the advancing edge of scientific medicine, and its application to the management of infectious disease in man. In the 1930s microbiology was a focus, with many of those projects reliant upon blood cultures and the techniques developed were published in a monograph – "Blood Cultures and their Significance" by H Butler in 1937. The Monograph Series lasted until 1974 – with 9 published. They covered anaesthesia, tumours, the cardiovascular system and scleroderma.
Basil Corkill described the methods of diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus at the Alfred Hospital in 1927. Twenty years later, in 1947, Joe Bornstein a young biochemist was introduced to Basil Corkill, who by then was Director of the Baker Institute. Their work together resulted in the discovery of the 2 forms of diabetes – insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This discovery in 1949 “..literally changed the concepts, research and treatment of diabetes”.
"In the circumstances of the formation of the Institute it was to be expected that much of the research, at least in the earlier years, would be directed to the application of existing knowledge to the practical problems of clinical medicine" T.E. Lowe
In their collection of memoirs of Baker Medical Research Institute Alumni, Andrew and Barnett describe the work of the Baker Institute to have “..always been in the interface between scientific medicine and the practice of medicine, a field engendered and enhanced by its association with Alfred Hospital.” They remark that from its earliest days, the staff were involved in communicating the outputs of research to the clinical community and the community in general. An example being the state-wide tours of Victoria that Basil Corkill and Ewen Downe made to introduce the new insulin treatment of diabetes mellitus. 
In 1940, Paul Fantl became interested in blood clotting. At the time, synthetic Vitamin K was being produced and was often in short supply. Using very simple equipment – test tubes, water bath, stop watches and a centrifuge – he was “in the forefront of a revolutionary concept that led to the recognition of Factors V, VII, and X”, and with Miss Nance, internationally credited with the discovery of Factor V. He went on to become a member of the International Committee for the Standardisation of the Nomenclature of Blood Clotting Factors in 1956. In 1963 he was honoured when the Fantl-Koller Schema was declared. 
Other areas of research up to 1949 included asthma, eye disease, immunoproteins, scleroderma and surgery. The research on surgery lead to the development of cardiac surgery at the Alfred Hospital. 
In the 1950s Tom Lowe decided to make a study of congestive heart failure. He concluded “that the body's fluid system was an 'open system' with an intake and output and divisions of the contents under control of various factors”. He was also interested in electrocardiography, especially vector cardiography and had machines constructed to show the three-dimensional view.
Between 1949 and 1974, staff at the Baker Medical Research Institute also devoted a significant amount of time and energy to equipment construction to meet the needs of their researchers, this included some early, crude versions of heart-lung machines to aid in cardiac surgery. Some research on the alimentary canal also was undertaken, however this work ceased in 1968.
In 1949, cardiovascular research was one of the major growth edges of medicine was cardiology. At the time, it represented two thirds of the total research in the Baker Medical Research Institute. Cardiology research included:
The International Diabetes Institute (1984–2008).
The International Diabetes Institute was started in Melbourne in 1984 by Professor Paul Zimmet AO a number of years after his appointment to the Royal Southern Memorial Hospital.
“The research of Paul and his team in Pacific and Indian Ocean populations has provided new insights into the genetic contribution of NIDDM as well as the role of obesity, physical activity, nutrition and sociocultural change in the aetiology of this disorder.”
In 1980 Dr Zimmet was asked by the Council of the Australian Diabetes Society to prepare a submission, along with colleague Dr Ian Martin, titled 'Diabetes in Australia'. The submission was to the Federal Minister of Health. The submission highlighted the impact of diabetes in the community and what government needed to invest to find a cure or treatment and to support people with diabetes. At the same time, with Drv Matthew Cohen, Zimmet was the first to report their experience with home glucose monitoring and its acceptance in the diabetic population. They found better control, less hypoglycaemia and 95% acceptance.
One of the most significant contributions of the International Diabetes Institute has been the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab). In 2000 it was the first national study to provide estimates of the number of people with diabetes (based on blood tests) and its public health and societal impact. It is now considered an integral component of the National Diabetes Strategy to tackle the mounting problem of diabetes and its complications in Australia.
In addition to research, the IDI operated diabetes clinics in Melbourne from the site of the Caulfield Hospital. The diabetes clinics are the largest in Victoria, with more than 8000 patients per year and continue to be operated by Baker IDI from the organisation's site in Prahran in Melbourne's inner south east.
Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute (2008–Present).
In 2008 the Baker Heart Research Institute, as it was then known, merged with the International Diabetes Institute (which had operated in Melbourne for over 25 years.)
Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute houses World Health Organisation Collaborating Centres for Research & Training in Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes (WHO Collaborating Centre for the Epidemiology of Diabetes Mellitus and Health Promotion for NCD Control).
Purpose.
The aims of research at Baker IDI are to increase understanding of the basic causes of heart disease and diabetes, their risk factors and the links between diabetes, metabolism, lifestyle, and the development of serious health complications, particularly heart, stroke and vascular disease. The Institute aims to use this knowledge to:
The Baker IDI's activities range from research at the laboratory bench to clinical trials in patients, and patient care.The major areas of basic and clinical research are:
These problems are approached at various levels:
Structure and organisation.
Locations.
Research, education to the public, health professionals, biomedical research students and patient care are located within the Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct in Melbourne Australia, the recently opened research facility in Adelaide, Australia and the Baker IDI Centre for Indigenous Vascular and Diabetes Research in Alice Springs. International projects in heart disease and diabetes are currently conducted in Mauritius, South Africa, Fiji, India and Vietnam.
Funding.
The Baker Heart Research Institute is funded from a diverse range of Government and private sources including the corporate sector, trusts and foundations and individual donors.
In 2007 the Baker IDI Concise Financial Report showed receipts from granting bodies of $32.6million. A further $7.4 million came from donations and bequests and $20.27 million from commercial income.

Cynapsus Therapeutics

Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. () is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing a drug to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Based in Toronto, Canada. Formerly named Cannasat Therapeutics they changed their name to Cynapsus Therapeutics in 2010. 
Company Overview.
Cynapsus is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing the only oral (sublingual) delivery of the only approved drug (apomorphine) to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Over one million people in the United States and an estimated 5 million people globally suffer from Parkinson's disease. Parkinson’s disease is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease that impacts motor activity, and its prevalence is increasing with the aging of the population. Based on the IMPACT Registry Study and the results of Cynapsus’ Global 500 Neurologists Survey, it is estimated that between 25 percent and 50 percent of patients experience “off” episodes in which they have impaired movement or speaking capabilities. Current medications only control the disease’s symptoms, and most drugs become less effective over time as the disease progresses.
Cynapsus’ lead drug candidate, APL-130277, is an easy-to-administer, fast-acting and oral reformulation of an approved drug, apomorphine, used to rescue patients from “off” episodes. Cynapsus is focused on rapidly maximizing the value of APL-130277 by completing pivotal studies in advance of a New Drug Application expected to be submitted in 2015. Cynapsus anticipates out-licensing to an appropriate pharmaceutical partner before such an application is submitted.
Products.
APL-130277.
APL-130277 is a reformulation of an approved Parkinson’s drug. APL-130277 is a novel oral formulation of an approved drug for Parkinson‘s patients designed to deliver significant clinical benefits over the current marketed treatment. The drug will treat patients with moderate to severe PD and address a significant unmet clinical need as expressed by clinicians and patients. The drug is expected to undergo accelerated approval through 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway with the US FDA and a similar pathway with other international regulatory agencies. This well developed regulatory path could result in a New Drug Approval application being submitted in late 2014 or early 2015. APL-130277 has the potential to address a significant underserved portion of $3 Billion+ Parkinson’s Disease market.
Cynapsus has entered into an agreement with Adagio Pharmaceuticals Ltd. granting Cynapsus the option to execute a proposed exclusive, worldwide agreement to license all intellectual property relating to and issued from continuing development APL-130277.

Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame

The Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame (or "Frauenhausmuseum" in German) is the city of Strasbourg's museum for Upper Rhenish fine and decorative arts from the early Middle Ages until 1681. The museum is famous for its rich holdings of original sculptures, glass windows, architectural fragments and building plans of Strasbourg Cathedral, as well as for its considerable collection of works by Peter Hemmel von Andlau, Niclas Gerhaert van Leyden, Ivo Strigel, Konrad Witz, Hans Baldung and Sebastian Stoskopff.
Historical overview.
The "Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame" had been created to merge under a single roof four thematically related but differently focussed collections of all types of Upper Rhenish art until 1681. It is located in the half-Gothic, half-Renaissance core building of the "Fondation de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame" and in several early Baroque timber-framed houses surrounding it.
The first documentary evidence of the Strasbourg "Fondation de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame" dates back to 1246, and it is still responsible for the maintenance of the cathedral. Besides the building plans, which have been saved from the very beginning, they also preserve architectural parts, such as fragments of the choir screen destroyed in 1681 and the originals of the sculptures which were removed or knocked down during the French Revolution and later replaced by copies. The "Société pour la conservation des monuments historiques d’Alsace" (Society for the Conservation of the Historical Monuments of Alsace), for their part, had endeavored to rescue the most valuable components and decorations (altars, statues, vessels, tapestries) from churches, cloisters and chapels which had been abandoned to destruction or decay throughout Alsace.
The painting collection of the city, restored by Wilhelm von Bode as of 1890, had also focussed right from the beginning on regional masters, through the donation of the "Portrait of the canon Ambrosius Volmar Keller", a masterpiece of Hans Baldung from the private collection of Wilhelm II. Finally, in the new museum of decorative arts of the city, the "Hohenlohe Museum", works of decorative art from the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Early Baroque were also exhibited. Those four collections, kept in various locations and with various points of concentration, were united in 1931 in the newly founded "Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame". In 1956, after the repair of the damage caused by the bombing of Strasbourg during the war in 1944, it was re-opened in an expanded condition.
Besides the cathedral sculptures, glass windows, etc., the collection also boasts valuable components from other Strasbourg churches, such as the Temple Neuf, destroyed in 1870, the Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Church, renovated in 1867, and the Église Sainte-Madeleine, destroyed by fire in 1904. In addition, the romanesque components (cloister, baptismal font) from Eschau and the stained glass windows from St. Peter and St. Paul's Church, Wissembourg and Mutzig are also important. Furthermore, many late gothic altars are assigned to anonymous masters of the Schongauer School.

The Crater Historic District encompasses National Park Service structures within Haleakala National Park. The buildings include utility structures, employee housing, administration facilities and visitor services facilities. Most were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps to standard Park Service designs in the 1930s. A few World War II era buildings survive from U.S. Army construction, and are included in the historic district. The Crater Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 1, 1974. 
The Park Service adapted its preferred National Park Service Rustic style to the Hawaiian Islands, avoiding the heavy log construction characteristic of the western continental United States parks in favor of a frame-construction interpretation for most buildings. The House of the Sun Visitor Center stands as the closest example of the mainland style of rubble construction with heavy framing. Designed by Park Service architect Merel Sager, it is also one of the few buildings that were not built with CCC labor.

Thomas Rowell Leavitt

Thomas Rowell "Tom" Leavitt (June 30, 1834 – May 21, 1891) was an early Mormon settler of Leavitt, Alberta, Canada, which the former Utah sheriff and marshal founded at age 53 after an arduous journey in covered wagons, fleeing a crackdown on polygamy that sent fellow Mormons across the border to Mexico and Canada.
Early Life.
Leavitt was born at Hatley, Quebec, Canada, on June 30, 1834, the son of Jeremiah Leavitt and his wife Sarah Sturdevant Leavitt. Jeremiah Leavitt had been born at Grantham, New Hampshire in 1797, and married Sarah Sturdevant of Grafton County, New Hampshire, in 1798. Shortly after their marriage, the couple departed for Hatley, only from the U.S.-Vermont border, where farmer Jeremiah Leavitt was attracted by the rich soil and plentiful timber. At the time of his immigration to Canada, the area around Hatley was fresh from control of Iroquois Indian tribes. Leavitt cleared his new acreage, on which he built a log cabin, and began raising an eventual family of 10 children.
In subsequent years, Jeremiah Leavitt and his wife Sarah joined the Latter-day Saints (Mormons) led by Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Thomas Rowell Leavitt was 16 months old when his parents pulled up stakes to follow Franklin Chamberlain, a Mormon convert who had married Lydia, the oldest child in the Leavitt family. The family returned to the United States, having been converted by Mormon missionaries who swept across eastern Canada on orders of Joseph Smith. The Leavitt family remained only briefly in New England, before launching themselves in 1835 towards Kirtland, Ohio, the gathering place of increasing crowds of Mormon converts. 
In September 1835, the extended Leavitt family came face-to-face with the man who had converted them long distance: Joseph Smith. No diary exists to describe what they made of their leader, but shortly afterwards the family departed with other recent converts to Smith's religion for Nauvoo, Illinois, the next jumping-off point on the Mormons' westward journey. Along the way, Jeremiah Leavitt's elderly mother, Sarah (Shannon) Leavitt, died of exposure. Having arrived in Nauvoo, the Leavitts bought a farm seven miles (11 km) outside town, where they began planting wheat.
But anti-Mormon sentiment reached a crescendo shortly afterwards, and in 1844 rioters set upon Joseph Smith, killing the church prophet and his brother Hyrum, and setting fire to Mormon properties. On Aug. 8, 1844, church elders voted to replace their fallen prophet with Brigham Young, who shortly afterwards announced his intention to found a Mormon sanctuary safe from persecution. Young's decision was prompted by the State of Illinois's move to expel the settlers from its territory. In 1846, the Leavitt family set out as part of Young's trek, with father Jeremiah dying along the way. Ultimately the family got as far as Council Bluffs, Iowa, where what remained of the family built a house overlooking the Missouri River at Trade Point, where they remained three years. By 1850, the worn-out Leavitt family departed for Utah, where they were told that a successful settlement had been made.
Westward.
The year 1850 was the highpoint of the California Gold Rush, as well as the Mormon migration westward. On June 1, 1850 a group of Latter Day Saints in 51 wagons, including the Leavitt family, crossed the Mississippi River behind Capt. Milo Andrus. Shortly afterwards, the company reached Zion, or Salt Lake City as it is known today. The Leavitt family subsequently moved to northern Utah, where Thomas Rowell Leavitt settled at Wellsville in Cache Valley, where he became constable, marshal and ultimately sheriff, as well as a rancher, and where he built a large one-room log house on his farm outside Wellsville.
But by the 1880s, the United States government's toleration of the Mormon practice of polygamy came to an end. The government began cracking down, arresting polygamists. Some hid, others crossed the border into Mexico and Canada. Among the first to leave was Charles Ora Card, who traveled to modern-day Cardston, Alberta, named for the Mormon settler, to escape the crackdown and founding the first Mormon town in Alberta in 1887.
Refuge in Canada.
Jeremiah Leavitt had never been a polygamist, but his sons followed the subsequent dictum that church members should take multiple wives.
By 1897 the rest of the family had followed, including Tom Leavitt's son Alfred, who subsequently helped dig, with his brother, the irrigation canals that Charles Ora Card had promised the Canadian government in exchange for more land grants to fellow Mormons hard-pressed by the U.S. government crackdown.
The former constable, sheriff and marshal Thomas Rowell Leavitt lived out his days in the tiny hamlet he founded in Alberta, known as Buffalo Flats on his arrival, and subsequently christened Leavitt, Alberta, in honor of the pioneer fugitive. Leavitt died there in 1891, leaving a legacy of scores of disciples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints named Leavitt, many of whom remain in the region today, ranching and living in the bucolic area in the shadow of Chief Mountain.

Gary Ormsby died of cancer; Austin bought his Top Fuel operation before the U.S. Nationals. He campaigned both cars at the event after testing his new Top Fuel dragster at one local event. After winning the Alcohol Funny Car finals at one of the next events, his blower malfunctioned during his burnout at the finals. Austin had to watch Kenny Bernstein as he smoked his tires to win the Top Fuel finals in a single. Austin continued to run both cars at events, vowing to win in both cars. His double eliminator win came two events later at Topeka. He won the Alcohol Funny Car finals over Chuck Cheeseman with a 5.97 second pass and the Top Fuel finals over Joe Amato with a 4.97 second pass. Austin avenged his final round Top Fuel loss to Bernstein at the Winston Finals at Ponoma and started the 1992 season by winning the second race of the year at the Motorcraft Ford Nationals in Phoenix Arizona over Doug Herbert.

Austin won Top Fuel at the 1993 U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis Raceway Park over Doug Herbert in a tire-smoking peddlefest final round. His fifth and final Top Fuel win was at Englishtown over Don "The Snake" Prudhomme in 1994 winning with a 4.88 to Prudhomme's 4.89. His last final round came in 1995 at Sonoma California losing to Mike Dunn. Austin became the first driver to achieve 250 miles per hour in the quarter mile in an Alcohol Funny Car in 1995.
In 1999, Austin noticed that IHRA drivers such as Von Smith having success in Hoosier Racing Tires. Austin had been experiencing severe tire shake and tire spinning problems. So he purchased a set of Hoosiers at the U.S. Nationals and used them in second round qualifying at the next event at Dallas, which was the first time that Hoosiers were used in an NHRA event. After having a relatively slow pass, he made gear ratio adjustments at later events. He started using the tires for all passes after having a 5.64 second pass. He had the first pass in the 5.5 second range (5.56 seconds at 257 mph) and won the race, marking the first time that a Hoosier tire won an NHRA Alcohol Funny Car event. 
In 2000, he recorded his 70th career victory, which put him fourth on the NHRA all-time win list. He had his 75th national victory at Ponoma's 2002 Winternationals. At that time he had 81 points wins for a total of 156 victories.

Bucky Austin had over 200 drag racing wins at Northwestern regional NHRA, AHRA and open matches. Pat described their relationship, "We've had our tense moments, just the same way as the businesses have been treated. It's competition.

The concept of the informed consumer is a fundamental one in the law of the European Union. Since the general Resolution of 1975, one of the primary objectives of the European Community, and then the European Union, has been the provision of information to consumers.

Court Challenges Program of Canada

The Court Challenges Program of Canada (CCP) is a non-profit organization whose stated purpose is "to provide financial assistance for important court cases that advance language and equality rights guaranteed under Canada's Constitution".
Its history can be traced to 1978, when the federal government of Canada began providing assistance for minority language cases. The government of Brian Mulroney created an expanded Court Challenges Program in 1985, after the equality section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms became law. However, the Mulroney government later withdrew financial support for the program in 1992. This was a controversial decision, and was opposed by many groups supporting social equality. The government of Jean Chrétien re-established the program in 1994, and the current CCP traces its origins to this period.
The government of Stephen Harper abolished the $5.5M in funding for the program in 2006. This was again a controversial decision, and was strongly criticized by some socially progressive organizations. The CCP no longer accepts new applications for funding, although it honours pre-existing grants and continues to process requests for reimbursement for these grants.
The program was partially restored in June 2008 for the official languages minority component of the program, under the name Language Rights Support Program.

Crum Hill, , located in northwest Massachusetts, USA, in the towns of Monroe and Florida, is the highest point in Franklin County. The mountain, part of the Hoosac Range (a west facing escarpment rising from the Hoosic River Valley directly east of North Adams, Massachusetts), is crossed by a trail system maintained by a local snowmobile club, the Florida Mountaineers. They maintain a trail map on their website.
Although Crum Hill is the highest geologic point of the Berkshires, Mount Greylock, , part of the Taconic Mountains and unrelated to the Berkshires geology, is often misattributed as the high point. 
The summit of Crum Hill is located in the town of Monroe, Franklin County; the west side of the mountain is located in the town of Florida, part of Berkshire County. The north and east sides of Crum Hill drain into Dunbar Brook, thence into the Deerfield River, the Connecticut River, and Long Island Sound; the west side drains into the Cold River, thence into the Deerfield River; and the south side drains into the Deerfield River via several small brooks.
The summit is also the site of Iberdrola Renewables' proposed Bakke Mountain Wind Farm, stalled as of 2008 due to environmental standards challenges.

Peter Care

Peter Care (born 28 April 1953) is an English director of music videos, commercials and film. He has directed music videos for R.E.M., Bruce Springsteen, Roy Orbison, Depeche Mode and New Order, amongst others.
Born in the southwest England town of Penzance, Peter Care first developed a passion for filmmaking while attending Falmouth Art College for his Foundation Year. In 1972, he moved north to study film at the Psalter Lane School Of Art in Sheffield. During the weekdays, he studied the history of cinema and made experimental short films. At weekends, he helped his teachers make documentaries, either as a cameraman or editor.
On graduating, Care, with four friends from the School of Art, formed the Sheffield Independent Film Company, a non-profit funded by the British Film Institute, the United Nations and Channel Four. It quickly grew to become the country’s largest filmmaking center outside of London, running workshops and helping people make their films and television shows. Care often acted as director of photography on other members’ projects, while directing his own dramas and archival documentaries for Sheffield City Council.
In 1979, Care made a short film called “Johnny Yesno”, with a soundtrack by the industrial band Cabaret Voltaire. This led him into making films for their projections at live performances, and creating compilations for their video distribution company, Doublevision. This work evolved into making music videos for many Northern indie bands.
The culmination of this period was the making of “Sensoria” for Cabaret Voltaire. Hardly shown on English TV, it became legendary in music circles, with its revolutionary camera and editing techniques, attracting interest from many bands outside of Sheffield.
Care joined the burgeoning music video scene in London, working with such artists as ABC, Fine Young Cannibals, Bananarama, and Depeche Mode.
Meanwhile, “Sensoria” was enjoying a life of its own in the US. It landed in the Top 40 of the MTV Viewers’ Chart, where it remained for seven months. Named Best Video of the Year by the Los Angeles Times, it was among the first three music videos ever to be procured by the Museum of Modern Art in New York for its permanent collection.
In 1986 Care moved to Los Angeles, where he met his wife, Lorraine, onset and they have been working together ever since.
What followed was a series of groundbreaking music videos for, amongst others, Robbie Nevil, Los Lobos, Bruce Springsteen, and Tom Petty.
As he moved on to make music videos (especially with R.E.M.) he began directing commercials at Satellite, the sister company of Propaganda. Clients included Coca-Cola, Levi’s, Microsoft, Lee Jeans, Sprint, MTV, JVC, Diet Coke, PacBell, Verizon, and Saturn.
In 2002, Care’s feature film, “The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys” was released. After enjoying great success at Sundance, it received glowing reviews from the US press and became a hit with teenagers once it came out on DVD. Care received an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature.
After ten years at Satellite, Care moved to a new production company, Bob Industries. While continuing to work with R.E.M., he made, over a decade, commercials for T-Mobile, Southwestern Airlines, Volkswagen, Toyota, Southwestern Bell, Burger King, A.A.R.P., Ameritrade, AT&T, MacDonald’s, Nikon, Discover Card, Pennzoil, Verizon, Domino’s Pizza, OnStar and the Tribeca Film Festival.
In 2012, Care moved to Wondros, with the view to work in a broader range of media, while also getting back to his documentary roots. He continued to make commercials - for PayPal, Walgreens and Chevrolet Silverado.
In 2013, he directed a short informational film for Santa Monica City Council. As part of their proposal to champion Wellbeing and empower their residents – competing in Michael Bloomberg’s Philanthropies’ Mayors Challenge - the two-minute piece helped them win a $1,000,000 prize.
Care kicked off 2014 by joining Green Dot Films…

Alkaline Trio discography

The discography of Alkaline Trio, a Chicago-based punk rock band, consists of nine studio albums, two compilation albums, one split album, four EPs, one video album, sixteen singles, one demo, nine digital releases, and thirteen music videos. Alkaline Trio formed in 1996 with an initial lineup of Matt Skiba (guitar, vocals), Rob Doran (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Glenn Porter (drums). This lineup released the band's demo tape and the 1997 single "Sundials" on Chicago record label Johann's Face Records, after which Doran left the band and was replaced by Dan Andriano. The group then signed to Asian Man Records and released their debut EP "For Your Lungs Only" and album "Goddamnit" in 1998. A second EP, "I Lied My Face Off", followed in 1999 and resulted in their first music video, for the song "Goodbye Forever". In 2000 Asian Man released the band's second album, "Maybe I'll Catch Fire", as well as the compilation album "Alkaline Trio", collecting most of their previously released early material. Porter then left and was replaced by Mike Felumlee.
The band next moved to Vagrant Records, releasing "From Here to Infirmary" in 2001. It was their first album to reach the "Billboard" charts, reaching #199 on the "Billboard" 200 and #9 amongst independent albums. Its two singles, "Stupid Kid" and "Private Eye", both charted on the UK Singles Chart. Felumlee then left and Derek Grant became the band's new permanent drummer. A split EP with Hot Water Music was released in 2002 through Jade Tree. The band's fourth album, "Good Mourning", was released in 2003 on Vagrant, reaching #1 on "Billboard"'s Top Independent Albums chart and #20 on the "Billboard" 200. "We've Had Enough" and "All on Black" were released as singles from this album, the former becoming the band's first song to chart in the United States. A DVD titled "Halloween at the Metro" was released later that year as an installment of Kung Fu Films' "The Show Must Go Off!" series. In 2004 the band participated in the "BYO Split Series" by releasing a split album with One Man Army.
Alkaline Trio's fifth album, "Crimson", was released in 2005 through Vagrant. It did not fare as well on the charts as "Good Mourning", though its three singles, "Time to Waste", "Mercy Me", and "Burn", became the band's highest-charting singles in the United Kingdom. In 2007 Vagrant released "Remains", a compilation album of B-sides, compilation and EP tracks, and live material. Alkaline Trio then moved to major label Epic Records for 2008's "Agony & Irony", which charted higher on the "Billboard" charts than any of their previous releases. It also spawned their highest-charting single in "Help Me", which reached #14 on Modern Rock Tracks. 2010's "This Addiction" was released through the band's newly formed label Heart & Skull, in partnership with Epitaph Records. It became the highest-charting album of their career, reaching #11 on the "Billboard" 200 and #1 on the Rock, Independent, and Alternative Albums charts. The band's eighth studio album, "Damnesia", followed in 2011, consisting of "semi-unplugged" versions of songs from their past releases as well as three new tracks. The band's ninth studio album, "My Shame Is True", was released on April 2, 2013.

Raymond Hitchcock (actor)

Raymond Hitchcock (October 22, 1865November 24, 1929) was a silent film actor, stage actor, and stage producer, who appeared in, or produced 30 plays on Broadway from 1898 to 1928, and who appeared in the silent films of the 1920s.
Biography.
He appeared first as a star in the character of Abijah Booze in "The Yankee Consul", and sang "It Was Not Like This in the Olden Time". In his stage career, Hitchcock went back and forth between dramatic roles and ones in comic opera. In 1905 he appeared on Broadway with John Bunny in "Easy Dawson" the two apparently playing firemen. Hitchcock also made several phonograph recordings of which many survive to lend an idea of what he sounded like.
In 1907, Hitchcock was charged with the sexual abuse of two adolescent girls together with New York magnate William A. Chanler. 
As Hitchcock's trial progressed, it was revealed that the charges of sexual abuse were fabricated as part of a blackmail scheme. Hitchcock was acquitted by a jury on June 11, 1908, after spending almost nine months in prison.
In 1925, Hitchcock appeared in a test film made by Lee DeForest in DeForest's Phonofilm sound-on-film process, in which Hitchcock performed a sketch from his revue "Hitchy-Koo", which was originally produced on Broadway in 1917, 1918, 1919, and 1920. Cole Porter wrote the music for the 1919 version. Raymond Hitchcock also figured prominently in John Ford's "Upstream" (1927).
He died on November 24, 1929.
Personal life.
Hitchcock was married to Freda Bowen from 1891 to 1903, and then was married to beautiful actress Flora Zabelle (1880-1968) from 1905 to his death in 1929. Hitchcock and Zabelle had no children. In one of her few movie roles, Zabelle appeared in the silent film "The Red Widow" (1916) opposite male lead John Barrymore. Barrymore's role had been played by Hitchcock in the 1911 Broadway production of "The Red Widow". According to the Daily Register Gazette, Hitchcock was cremated with plans to return his ashes to Canandaigua, New York for burial in the family plot at Woodlawn Cemetery.

Office of the President-Elect

The Office of the President-Elect was a title used by Barack Obama for the body coordinating his transition activities of the President-elect of the United States. The office is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, nor is it a statutory office of the federal government; however, under the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (P.L. 88-277), amended by the Presidential Transitions Effectiveness Act of 1998 (P.L. 100-398) and the Presidential Transition Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-293), the President-Elect is entitled to request and receive certain privileges from the General Services Administration as he prepares to assume office.
Presidential Transition Act.
Section 3 of the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 was enacted to help smooth transitions between incoming and outgoing presidential administrations. To that end, provisions such as office space, payment of transition staff members, postal services, and telecommunication services are allotted, upon request, to the President-Elect, though the Act grants the President-elect no official powers and makes no mention of an "Office of the President-Elect."
Media discussion.
In 2008, President-elect Barack Obama gave numerous speeches and press conferences in front of a placard emblazoned with "Office of the President Elect" and used the same term on his website. British journalist Tony Allen-Mills disputed the office as "a bogus concoction that has no basis in the U.S. Constitution."
2012 Romney site.
On the night of the 2012 election, a transition website for presidential candidate Mitt Romney, intended to be put into place in the event that the candidate defeated President Obama's re-election, used the term "Office of the President-Elect" in its header, with a different seal emblem than the one used by Obama's Office of the President-Elect. The site was taken down from the Internet shortly after being discovered.

Eastern Southland Gallery

The Eastern Southland Gallery is a major provincial art gallery in Gore, Southland, New Zealand. The gallery is housed in the town's former Carnegie library building, which was built in 1909 (extended in 2003). The gallery is located at 14 Hokonui Drive, the northern end of Gore's main street, close to the town clocktower and public library.
Though principally a provincial gallery, the Eastern Southland Gallery is important due to two of its major permanent exhibits, the Ralph Hotere Gallery and the John Money Collection. The gallery also hosts regular shows in two separate wings.
Ralph Hotere Gallery.
The Ralph Hotere Gallery contains a significant number of works by arguably New Zealand's most prominent contemporary artist, Ralph Hotere. This series of works was created in collaboration with poet Hone Tuwhare, and comprises one of the largest and most important collections of work by both Hotere and Tuwhare.
John Money Collection.
The John Money Collection is a substantial collection of artworks, most of which are either ethnological artefacts or modern art drawing on tribal art for its inspiration (including several notable works by Theo Schoon). It has been housed in a specially-built extension to the gallery since December 2003. The collection was the passion of noted sexologist John Money, who donated much of his collection to the gallery in 2002, and was built up over several decades from the 1940s on. Money had become friends with Schoon in Christchurch in the 1940s, and also with many other members of New Zealand's art elite, including Rita Angus and Douglas Lilburn. 
Schoon's interest in Maori art led to an awakening in similar interests in Money, and from 1947 (when Money moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) he became a patron of Schoon and Angus and also an avid collector of tribal art, including works from Australia, Africa, and the Americas. 
The Collection as presented in the Eastern Southland Gallery is dominated by a series of large sculptural figures from West Africa, alongside which sit modern art from the United States and New Zealand and Aboriginal art from Australia.

Bahá'í Faith in Chad

Though the Bahá'í Faith in Chad began after its independence in 1960 members of the religion were present in associated territories since 1953. The Bahá'ís of Chad elected their first National Spiritual Assembly in 1971. Through succeeding decades Bahá'ís have been active in a number of ways and by some counts have become the third largest international religion in Chad with over 80300 members by 2000 and 96800 in 2005.
Early phase.
Before independence the region of Chad was part of the French Equatorial Africa (as well as modern day Congo, Central Africa, and Gabon.) The first pioneers in the region were Max Kinyerezi who settled in what was then French Equatorial Africa (specifically in the area later part of Republic of the Congo), and Samson Mungono in the Belgian Congo (some other parts of which later became part of Chad); both arrived in 1953 from expansion of the Bahá'í Faith in Uganda in the same trip that delivered Enoch Olinga to British Cameroon. The Bahá'ís organized these and neighboring areas into the regional National Spiritual Assembly of central and eastern Africa in 1956 - including Uganda, Tanganyika, Kenya, Belgian Congo, Ruanda-Urundi, French Equatorial Africa, Zanzibar, Comoro Is, Seychelles and Chagos Archipelago. However once Chad was politically independent none of the territory specific to Chad had a Baha'i in it until 1961. The first Bahá'í in Chad was Cleophas K. Vava in what was then called Fort Lamy, the capital. About November 1962 the national spiritual assembly of Central and West Africa was claiming over 14,000 people almost all of whom were not in Chad. The situation changed little when the regional assembly associations were changed in 1963 to align Chad with Uganda and other central African countries. Early pioneers were Dempsey and Adrienne Morgan arrived in December 1967. The first native Chadian Bahá'í, Ernest Nbouba, converted early in 1968. By Ridván 1968 there were 7 Chadian Bahá'ís and two pioneers so a local assembly was elected. By 1969 the community had jumped to almost 1200 Bahá'ís and thirteen assemblies among 63 localities Bahá'ís were to be found in. There are anecdotes of a student returning home from Cameroon where he had heard of the religion and converted in Chad at the beginning of summer 1970. When he moved to Bongor in October to continue his studies he successfully spread his new religion among his fellow students and the growth extended into the city to become an area of six assemblies and over 125 Bahá'ís by April 1971.
Growth.
Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected Universal House of Justice was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bahá'í communities of Africa by splitting off regional national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1967 though the 1990s. The Bahá'í community was much stimulated by the arrival of the first Hand of the Cause to visit Chad, Rúhíyyih Khanum who had been crossing Africa from east to west visiting many country's communities including Chad. She arrived by way of Bangui in February 1970, on the tenth anniversary of Chad's independence, to Fort Lamy and visited there and in the villages of Gassi and Djari. During the two weeks visit she met with mostly individuals and institutions of the religion. In Gassi she helped dedicate the Bahá'í center being built. From Chad Khanum traveled into Cameroon. Two developments following her trip were the participation of Chad Bahá'ís in the first regional national convention of central Africa held in Bangui (Uganda splitting off its own national assembly in 1970) and second, the Bahá'ís of Chad attempted to be registered with the federal government but it turned out the government had no procedure to register a new religion organizing in the country. Chad delegates to the regional convention arrived in time for pre-convention classes and saw Hand of the Cause Abu'l-Qásim Faizi who represented the Universal House of Justice. Consultation at the convention noted the fast growth of the religion in Chad and Faizi appointed Adrienne Morgan as an Auxiliary Board Member. Back in Chad and the pursuit of official recognition from the government, Dr. Aziz Navidi, a lawyer and pioneer, representing the Universal House of Justice, assisted by sharing information about the world wide character of the religion to the authorities while appeals were processed by the community and government which was finally brought to the attention of then President, François Tombalbaye. Following this success in February the community gather in convention for the election of its first National Spiritual Assembly in April 1971 which was attended by Enoch Olinga who was himself then appointed as a Hand of the Cause. The convention was held in Gassi outside of Fort Lamy in part because a village chief had joined the religion and provided a large meeting space for the convention. An anecdote told by Olinga at the convention captured the need for the fast growing community's need to study their new religion and understand it personally. He compared the need for daily prayer with the need for daily food. We don't wait for someone else to eat for us, nor should be wait for someone else to pray for us. The community of the religion in Fort Lamy was then counted at over one thousand while the community across Chad was characterized as being ninety-six local spiritual assemblies among the 300 localities with Bahá'ís who had swollen to more than 8000. The second national convention held two days of classes for the delegates to understand the process and purpose of convention, of the national assembly, and their role as delegates and those of officers of the convention (which they too elect.) The Bahá'ís of Gassi had already formed a children's Bahá'í school while land for nine Bahá'í centers was donated at the convention and the consultation of the delegates focused on the need to French-speaking pioneers who understood the religion especially in outlying areas. In December 1971 bus loads and cars of youth came from Chad and the Central African Republic to Cameroon who hosted the first regional African youth conference.
In 1972 (and again in 1974) the Bahá'ís of Chad celebrated the first United Nations Day of Chad. The public meeting held at the national Bahá'í center with the cooperation of United Nations Development Program Resident Representative featured an assistant of the UN Representative who spoke and offered literature while a Bahá'í spoke of the Bahá'í teachings - the event was covered by print and radio media in Chad and 50 people attended the meeting. The third national convention was held in Sarh in southern Chad where the mayor had donate use of the city's municipal center. In 1974 prayers were published translated into Massa, Ngambay and Kanuri languages. In October 1976 the Bahá'ís held a national conference on the progress of the religion as part of a wave of such conferences across the world. Following the conference waves of traveling Bahá'ís, some from Iran, brought the religion to villages as well as offering institutes to promote understanding of the religion and classes for children. In January 1977 the Bahá'ís in Sahr held a conference for women at which only 12 of the 40 participants were Bahá'ís following which a wave of conversions included half women. Other conferences continued through summer 1977. The community of Chad avoided being banned as part of a sweep across several Sub-Saharan countries. Chad was one of the countries Bahá'í organized a series of events in honor of the International Year of the Child, 1979. A Bahá'í consultant traveled western Africa including Chad assisting communities in their efforts. Though the consultant took ill in Chad, the program developed was the most successful in the region. A children's committee organized institutes for 125 villages and themselves conducted the meetings and produced a set of lesson plans in both French and English that was distributed to other West African communities. In 1981 the national convention was held in Moïssala In 1982 sixty of the local assemblies of Chad were designated as leaders in their regions to help nearby communities organize their religious meetings while at the same time a regional permanent institute was finished in Manda. In 1983 crowd surpassing the seats allotted turns out for a film describing Bahá'í pilgrimage in Moïssala.
Activities of a growing community.
Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. There is evidence of activities of the Bahá'í community through from the '80s through 2008 and some by invitation with third parties. Bahá'í youth have mobilized for a number of purposes over the years. Bahá'ís have also been cooperative agents with various agencies and the Bahá'ís started a non-governmental organization devoted to solving local ecological and developmental challenges. See details below. The overall process of advancing development projects gained the a diploma of Participation from the Trade Chamber at the fourth International Fair of Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (later renamed the Economic Community of Central African States).
Modern community.
Long term pioneers are in Chad - some of many years stay and others of a short stay. There are Ruhi Institute Study Circles. There are weekly prayer meetings in French held on Saturday afternoons at the Bahá'í Center in N’Djamena. The religion continues to grow through the 1980s establishing schools, libraries, a pharmacy and exhibits on Bahá'í marriage in the name of the religion. Sometimes more people came than could take classes while some of these institutions became self-sustaining.
Demographics.
The World Christian Encyclopedia estimates the Bahá'í population in 2000 to be over 80300, 96845 in 2005 and is the third largest internationally organized religion after Islam and Christianity in the country.

Konrad Maurer

Konrad Maurer, since 1876 Konrad von Maurer (April 29, 1823 - September 16, 1902) was a German legal historian. He was the son of legal historian and statesman Georg Ludwig von Maurer (1790-1872). Maurer is considered one of the most significant researchers of Nordic legal and constitutional history.
Biography.
Konrad Heinrich Maurer was born in 1823 in Frankenthal (Palatinate), as the only son of Georg Ludwig von Maurer und Friederike Maurer née Heydweiller. In 1826 the family moved to Munich (Bavaria), where his father was appointed professor of German legal history. Here, Konrad Maurer's mother died when he was seven. His father never remarried. Konrad Maurer spent two years of his childhood in Greece where his father was appointed a member of the council of regency of king Otto of Greece. Afterwards the family returned to Munich.
Bowing to his father's wish, Konrad Maurer studied law at the Universities of Munich, Leipzig and Berlin, earning his doctorate in 1845. In 1847 he became an associate professor, and in 1855 a full professor of legal history at the University of Munich.
Maurer was a leading authority of Germanic/Nordic legal and constitutional history. He had a special interest in Icelandic literature, history, language and culture and was an outspoken advocate for Icelandic political independence from Danish rule, supporting Jón Sigurðsson in his cause.
In 1858, Maurer undertook a personal travel to Iceland. Inspired by his contacts to Jacob Grimm (from the Brothers Grimm), he used the opportunity to collect Icelandic folk tales and published them after his return under the title "Isländische Volkssagen der Gegenwart". This was the first detailed publication of Icelandic folk tales in German.
Maurer read lectures in Munich, Oslo, and Kopenhagen. In 1865, he was appointed a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and in 1876 he was awarded (nonhereditary) knighthood of the Merit Order of the Bavarian Crown. By this he was officially given the title "(Ritter) von Maurer"; however he did not like the title and always preferred to be called just Maurer. In the same year, Maurer was offered his own chair at the University of Christiania, which he declined.
Throughout his life Maurer was a close friend to the Icelandic scholar Guðbrandur Vigfússon, the Norwegian folklorist Peter Christen Asbjørnsen, playwright Henrik Ibsen und writer Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. He retired in 1888 and died 1902 in Munich, where he was buried in Alter Südfriedhof. His considerable library, which he had inherited from his father and expanded to over 9000 volumes, was sold in 1904, for the major part to Harvard University and the rest to the bar association of New York. A part of it is today in the libraries of Yale Law School and George Washington University Law School.
Maurer had eight children. His eldest son Ludwig Maurer became a mathematician.

List of United States Senators in the 79th Congress by seniority

This is a classification of United States Senators by seniority during the 79th Congress, from January 3, 1945 to January 3, 1947.
Order of service is based on the commencement of the senator's first term. Behind this is former service as a senator (only giving the Senator seniority within his or her new incoming class), service as Vice President, a House member, a Cabinet secretary, or a governor of a state. The final factor is the population of the senator's state.
Senators who were sworn in in the middle of the two-year congressional term (up until the last senator who was not sworn in early after winning the November 1946 election) are listed at the end of the list with no number.

Save the Garment Center

Save the Garment Center is a campaign spearheaded by designers Nanette Lepore and Anna Sui as well as many local designers, organizations and fashion manufacturers to preserve New York City's fading Garment District. The loss of jobs and culture as a result of non-conducive zoning laws has led many in the industry to join together on a campaign to save what is left of the once-vibrant garment center. Fashion Week in September 2008 was filled with t-shirts that embodied the cause and provided contact information of city officials. "Women's Wear Daily" highlighted the issue during this week, and many designers and members of the Council of Fashion Designers of America lauded the effort.

Alvan Feinstein

Alvan R. Feinstein (Dec 4, 1925 - October 25, 2001) was a clinician, a researcher and an epidemiologist who made significant impact on clinical investigation, especially on the field of clinical epidemiology that he helped define. He died at the age of 75 in Toronto on 25 October 2001 and is survived by his wife and two children.
Born in Philadelphia, Feinstein received his bachelor's degree (BSc 1947) and master's degree (MSc, 1948) at the University of Chicago. Feinstein received his medical degree (MD, 1952) at the University of Chicago School of Medicine. He completed undertook his residency training in Internal Medicine at Rockefeller Institute. He was Board Certified in Internal Medicine in 1955 and became the medical director of Irvington House Institute (which later became part of New York University Langone Medical Center). While there, he studied patients with rheumatic fever and challenged the belief that proper treatment after an early diagnosis kept those patients from developing severe heart disease later in life. He demonstrated that the disease had different forms including one which causes joint pain and seldom progresses to heart disease. The other, which does result in heart disease, has no symptoms to evoke early detection. Thus, diagnosis of the disease at an early stage leads to a favorable outcome not because of early treatment but because those patients tend to have a less-virulent form.
In 1962, Feinstein joined the Yale University School of Medicine faculty and became the founding director of its Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program in 1974. Under his direction, the program became recognized as one of the leading centers for training in clinical research methods.
He published his first paper as a medical student in 1951 and more than 400 throughout his career. He wrote six major textbooks, two of which, "Clinical Judgment" (1967) and "Clinical Epidemiology" (1985) are among the most widely referenced books in clinical epidemiology. He completed the last one, "Principles of medical statistics" (2002), just before his death. At the time of his death he was the Sterling Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology, the highest academic distinction at Yale University.
His editorial work included that of the Journal of Chronic Diseases (1982–1988) and he founded and was editor of the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology (1988–2001).
Awards.
During his career, Feinstein garnered numerous recognitions and awards; including the Francis Gilman Blake Award as outstanding teacher to Yale medical students (1969), Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation Award from the American College of Physicians (1982), Robert J. Glaser Annual Award from the Society for General Internal Medicine (1987), J. Allyn Taylor International Prize in Medicine (1987), Gairdner Foundation (Canada) International Award (1993), and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from McGill University (1997). In 1991, Feinstein was named the Sterling Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology, Yale University's most prestigious academic honor.
Controversy.
In his later years, controversy marred his career with claims that he may have helped the tobacco industry by publishing articles minimizing the deleterious effects of smoking. 
A review of Feinstein's publications in 2002 concluded that "perhaps in hindsight Feinstein could be criticized for not having clearly indicated the sponsorship of the tobacco industry behind these publications, of which he was fully aware. However, this does not suffice to infer that he was the tobacco industry's man. Feinstein's attitude in matters of publication appears balanced". However, this review, an invited article written soon after Feinstein's death and published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, may not be unbiased. For the fourteen years preceding his death, Feinstein was Editor in Chief of this journal, which was the publication outlet for numerous articles and opinion pieces by Feinstein and his colleagues that aimed to debunk the research on tobacco, for which role the journal was subsequently criticized.

Ed Diener

Edward Diener (born 1946) is an American psychologist, professor, and author. He is noted for his research over the past twenty-five years on happiness — the measurement of well-being; temperament and personality influences on well-being; theories of well-being; income and well-being; and cultural influences on well-being. 
As shown on Google Scholar as of January 2014, Diener's publications have been cited over 76,000 times.
For his fundamental research on the subject, Diener is nicknamed "Dr. Happiness." He has worked with researchers Daniel Kahneman and Martin Seligman — and he is a senior scientist for the Gallup Organization.
Background.
Diener was born in 1946 in Glendale, California and grew up on a farm in the San Joaquin Valley of California. His wife Carol and three of his children are psychologists.
He attended San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno and subsequently received his B.A. in Psychology in 1968 from California State University at Fresno. He received his doctorate at the University of Washington in 1974 and was a faculty member at the University of Illinois for 34 years, retiring from active teaching in 2008.
He holds the Smiley chair, the Joseph R. Smiley Distinguished Professor of Psychology, at the University of Illinois. In 2010 he received honorary doctorates from the Free University of Berlin and Eureka College. He has won the distinguished scientist award from the International Society of Quality of Life Studies, as well as the Jack Block award for outstanding contributions to personality psychology.
His son Robert Biswas-Diener (born 1972) is also a psychologist.
Happiness research.
Diener, also known as Dr. Happiness, is one of the lead researchers in the field of subjective well-being. Subjective well-being (SWB), as Diener et al. define it, is how people evaluate their lives - both at the moment and for longer periods such as for the past year. These evaluations include people’s emotional reactions to events, their moods, and judgments they form about their life satisfaction, fulfilment, and satisfaction with domains such as marriage and work.
In 2002, Diener conducted a study at the University of Illinois with Martin Seligman, finding that "the most salient characteristics shared by the 10% of students with the highest levels of happiness and the fewest signs of depression were their strong ties to friends and family and commitment to spending time with them." Diener has said "It is important to work on social skills, close interpersonal ties and social support in order to be happy."
Temperament and personality influences on SWB.
Diener has found that the correlations between SWB and extraversion and neuroticism are stronger than the correlations with any demographic predictor or major life circumstance that has thus been studied. 
One aspect of individual differences in well-being that his research on personality and SWB has been focused on is emotional reactivity/ reward theory. Diener discovered that there are reasons for greater SWB among extraverts beyond the fact that they spend more time with others, a hypothesis popularized by other researchers. He found that the more active reward system in extraverts is a greater influence than the social or nonsocial aspect of a situation. This is evident in his research that shows that the pleasantness of a situation is a more important factor than the social or nonsocial aspect in determining extraverts’ enjoyment. His longitudinal studies also reveal that extraverts are happier whether living solitarily or with others, working in social or nonsocial job environments, and living in large cities or rural areas.
Objective benefits of SWB.
Diener proposes that happiness has benefits beyond “feeling good”. In a paper published in 2011, Diener and Chan reviewed eight types of evidences that support a causal relationship from SWB to health and longevity. After examining results from longitudinal studies, meta-analysis, animal experiments, human experiments and natural quasi-experiments, Diener and Chan concluded that the evidences overwhelmingly support the argument that high SWB causes better health and longevity (Diener & Chan, 2011). Diener also summarized the pathways, through which happiness affects health and longevity. Among which are SWB’s influence on physiological processes underlying health and disease, on practice of good health behaviors, and on fulfilling social relationships. Meanwhile, Diener and his colleagues showed that higher SWB leads to higher income, better job performance, more creativity and productivity. They also illustrated that happiness brings about greater self-control, more pro-social behaviors and higher-quality social relationships (DeNeve, Diener, Tay, & Xuereb, 2013). In short, happiness is functional.
Optimum level of SWB.
Despite the advantages of happiness for functioning, one line of Diener’s research concerns with the question “can people be too happy”. Using large survey data and longitudinal data, Diener and his colleagues showed that too much happiness could be detrimental to one’s income, education and political participation(Oishi, Diener,& Lucas, 2007). The most successful people in terms of these three variables are those who experience moderate to high levels of happiness, but not extremely high happiness. However, the very happiest people are most successful in terms of close relationships and volunteer work.
Limits to adaptation of well-being and set point change.
The traditional adaption theory of Well-Being suggests that people have a pre-determined set point for happiness (Brickman & Campbell, 1971). Any life event, positive or negative, can only have transitory influences on SWB. Diener’s research challenged the theory by showing that people do not adapt completely to all events. Some powerful events or circumstances can change people’s emotional set points (Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006). In particular, people who lose their spouses or jobs cannot fully recover many years after the events (Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, & Diener, 2004). The discovery has profound implications. First, it explains the enormous differences of SWB between nations across the globe (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013). Second, it sheds light on the possibility for interventions, both at the individual-level and the societal level, to produce lasting boosts in happiness. Diener and his colleagues also discovered individual differences in adaptation. For instance, some people adapt quickly to the joy of marriage, while others experience a long-lasting effect on their SWB.
Income and SWB.
Using longitudinal data from over 100 countries, Diener and his colleagues showed that rich countries are in general happier than poor countries (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013). Also, life satisfaction for most countries goes up as they become wealthier over time. Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010). The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.
Culture influences on SWB.
In recent years, Diener has conducted major studies looking at the role of culture in explaining the international differences of SWB. One important finding is that predictors of SWB may differ across cultures (Tov & Diener, 2007). For example, the association between self-esteem and life satisfaction is much stronger in individualist culture than in collectivistic culture (Diener & Diener, 1995; Oishi, Diener, Lucas, & Suh, 1999). Diener and his colleagues also discovered a cultural congruence effect such that people are happier if their characteristics match the cultural norms (Fulmer et al., 2010). For instance, religious people are much happier than nonreligious people in very religious nations or regions, but such a difference disappears in nonreligious nations or regions (Diener, Tay, & Myers, 2011). Finally, Diener investigated the differences of SWB among affluent countries. He compared the SWB scores of Denmark and the United States and discovered the “Danish Effect”: people in Denmark are in general happier than those in the USA despite of similar income because the poorest citizens in Denmark are more satisfied with their lives than the poorest ones in the US (Biswas-Diener, Vitterso, & Diener, 2010).
Measurement of SWB.
Together with his colleagues, Diener has developed three scales that help scientists to assess Well-Being. The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) measures global cognitive judgments of satisfaction with one’s life (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985). The original article has been cited for over 7,400 times and the SWLS has become the most widely used scale for evaluating life satisfaction. The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) assess one’s frequency of experiencing a variety of positive and negative emotions. The Flourishing Scale (FS) measures one’s self-perceived success in important areas of life, such as relationship, self-esteem, and optimism (Diener et al., 2009).
Accomplishments.
In 2012, Diener was awarded the Distinguished Scientist Lifetime Career Award by the American Psychological Association. In 2013, Diener became the recipient of the William James Lifetime Achievement Award by the Association for Psychological Science. Diener founded a new journal, Perspectives on Psychological Science, which has become one of the most acclaimed and widely read journals in the field. He is also one of the founding editors of Journal of Happiness Studies.
Diener is listed on the Institute of Scientific Information’s most-cited psychologist list, with a total of approximately 74,000 citations. 
Diener has published 300 books and articles. He has several Psychological Bulletin articles, several American Psychologist papers, 7 publications in Psychological Science, and over 50 publications in JPSP, more than any other author. He has authored three books and edited seven more. 
Working with the Gallup survey organization, Diener conducted the first poll of the world ever conducted, including 155 nations and representing 99 percent of the population of the globe. 
More than any other scientist, Diener has studied the poorest people in the world, including groups such as the homeless and those living in slums such as in Calcutta. In this research he has discovered how some individuals can achieve positive well-being in dire circumstances, for example through their relationships and spirituality. 
In recognition of his scientific contributions, Ed Diener holds an endowed chair at his university, the Joseph R. Smiley Distinguished Professorship of Psychology. He has received the Distinguished Scientist Award from both the American Psychological Association and the International Society of Quality of Life Studies, and the outstanding personality psychologist award (the “Jack Block Award”) from Division 8 of APA, the Society of Personality and Social Psychology. Diener has several honorary doctorates to his name, is a fellow of five scientific societies, and he has been the focus of many popular media articles, from Newsweek to the Wall Street Journal to Reader’s Digest.
National accounts of SWB.
Diener proposed that nations collect data on the subjective and psychological well-being of citizens to help in policy discussions. In 2004 Diener authored with Martin Seligman an influential article, Beyond Money: Toward an Economy of Well-being, arguing that the well-being indicators would supplement economic, educational, and other national measures to provide policy makers and leaders with important information. The idea is that because subjective well-being is affected by many aspects of quality of life in societies, the subjective well-being measures could be used to examine who and in what regions of nations people were flourishing versus suffering. The finding that subjective well-being is beneficial to outcomes such as health, longevity, social relationships, and work productivity, added force to the proposal. The idea of national accounts of well-being has met with some success. The United Kingdom adopted well-being measures based on a directive from David Cameron, the Prime Minister. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development issued guidelines in 2013 for national accounts of subjective well-being, and a number of nations are now collecting such data.

<doc id="20423455" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20423455" title="Wessagusset Colony">
Wessagusset Colony

Wessagusset Colony (sometimes called the Weston Colony or Weymouth Colony) was a short-lived English trading colony in New England located in present-day Weymouth, Massachusetts. It was settled in August 1622 by between fifty and sixty colonists who were ill-prepared for colonial life. After settling without adequate provisions and harming relations with local Native Americans, the colony was dissolved in late March 1623 with surviving colonists joining Plymouth Colony or returning to England. It was the second settlement in Massachusetts, predating the Massachusetts Bay Colony by six years.
Called by historian Charles Francis Adams, Jr. "ill-conceived, "ill-executed, ill-fated", the short-lived colony is best remembered for the battle (some say massacre) there between Plymouth troops led by Miles Standish and an Indian force led by Pecksuot. This battle scarred relations between the Plymouth colonists and the natives and was fictionalized, two centuries later, in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1858 poem, "The Courtship of Miles Standish".
In September 1623, a second colony led by Governor-General Robert Gorges was created in the abandoned site at Wessagusset. This colony, rechristened as Weymouth, was also unsuccessful and Governor Gorges returned to England the following year. Despite that, some settlers remained in the village and it was absorbed into the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630.
Origins.
The colony was coordinated by Thomas Weston, a London merchant and ironmonger. Weston was associated with the Plymouth Council for New England which, fifteen years earlier, had funded the short-lived Popham Colony in modern Maine. During the period when the Pilgrims were in the Netherlands, Weston helped to arrange the colonists' passage to the New World with help from the Merchant Adventurers. Historian Charles Francis Adams, Jr. writing in 1870s glowingly called him a "sixteenth century adventurer" in the mold of John Smith and Walter Raleigh and that his "brain teemed with schemes for deriving sudden gain from the settlement of the new continent". In later years, Plymouth Governor William Bradford called him "a bitter enemy unto Plymouth upon all occasions."
The primary purpose of Weston's new colony was profit, rather than the religious reasons of the Plymouth settlers, and this dictated how the colony would be assembled. Weston believed that families were a detriment to a well-run plantation and so he selected able-bodied men only but not men experienced in colonial life. In total, there were several advanced scouts and fifty to sixty other colonists. The final complement also included one surgeon and one lawyer. The party was outfitted with enough supplies to last the winter.
First Wessagusset colony.
An advance team of several settlers arrived at the Plymouth Colony in May 1622. They had voyaged to the new world on board the "Sparrow", an English fishing-vessel which was sailing to the coast of modern-day Maine. After arriving at the coast of Maine, they traveled the final in a shallop with three members of the "Sparrow"'s crew. These colonists stayed only briefly in Plymouth before scouting the coast in their shallop to find a site for their colony. After finding one, they negotiated with the sachem Aberdecest for the land and returned to Plymouth, sending the shallop and her small crew back to the "Sparrow", and awaited the remainder of the colonists.
At first, the relationship between the two groups was cordial and the men of the Wessagusset assisted Plymouth with their harvest, but they were accused of stealing from the elder colony. Shortly after relocating to Wessagusset, angry Indians complained to Plymouth that the colonists were stealing their corn. In response, Plymouth could only send a "rebuke" to the new colony. Because of the disorder of the colony, as subsequently reported by Plymouth's Governor Bradford, Wessagusset was consuming food too quickly and it became apparent that they would run out before the end of the winter. In addition, Plymouth was also low on supplies due to spending additional time during the growing season building fortifications, rather than growing crops.
To prevent hunger or famine for both colonies, Plymouth and Wessagusset colonists organized a joint trading mission with the natives with goods brought by the Wessagusset colonists. That trading mission was somewhat successful and the two colonies split the proceeds. In November, Greene died and John Sanders was made governor of the colony. By January, the colonists continued to trade with the natives for food, but at a severe disadvantage. This drove up the barter-price of corn and they were forced to trade their clothes and other needed supplies. Some colonists entered a form of servitude, building canoes and performing other labors for the natives, in exchange for food. Ten colonists died. After an incident where one settler was caught stealing by the natives, the colonists hanged him in their view as a show of good faith. However, sources disagree whether the man hanged was the culprit and the colonists may have hanged an older, possibly dying man, instead. The legend that the Wessagusset colonists hanged an innocent man was later popularized by a satirical depiction of this event in Samuel Butler's 1660s poem "Hudibras". In February, Sanders petitioned to Plymouth for a joint attack on the natives, but this was rejected by Plymouth's governor.
Killings at Wessagusset.
One colonist at Wessagusset, seeing these signs and other indications of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation and the perception of imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, he met with the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, was led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes from as far away as Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.
Standish called all of the Wessagusset colonists into the stockade for defense. The following day, several natives including the local chief, Pecksuot, were at Wessagusset. Historical sources give different accounts of the killings. In some manner, four of the natives, including the local chief, were in the same room as Standish and several of his men. One source, from the 1880s, suggests that it was the natives that arranged to be alone with Standish to allow them to attack the colonist. Others sources state that it was Standish who had invited the natives into the situation on peaceful pretenses. When four of them, including the local chief, were in a room within the village, Standish gave the order to strike, quickly killing Pecksuot with his own knife. Several other natives in the village were attacked next; only one escaped to raise the alarm. As many as five Englishmen were also killed in the brief battle and one native's head was cut off, to be displayed in Plymouth as a warning to others.
In 1858, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow included a fictionalized depiction of the killings in his epic poem, "The Courtship of Miles Standish". In his version, the Indians are depicted as begging for weapons to use against other tribes. Standish responds by offering them bibles. After being the target of boasts and taunts by the Indians, Standish attacks first:
Aftermath.
Following the brief conflict, Standish offered to leave several soldiers to defend the colony, but the offer was rejected. Instead, the colonists divided: some, including John Sanders, returned to England in the "Swan", while others remained behind and joined the Plymouth colony. By spring of 1623, the village was empty and the colony was dissolved. Thomas Weston arrived in Maine several months later, seeking to join his colony, only to discover that it was already failed. Some of his former settlers apparently had gone north to Maine, and were living on House Island in Casco Bay in a home built by explorer Capt. Christopher Levett, who had been granted land to found an English colony. (Levett's settlement also failed, and the fate of Weston's men is uncertain.)
Due to the fighting at Wessagusset, Plymouth trade with the Indians was devastated for years. Local tribes which had previously been favorable to Plymouth, began to forge bonds with other tribes in defense against the English. This latent hostility would eventually boil over during the Pequot War and later, King Philip's War. Historians differ on whether the conflict could have been avoided or the colony saved. Some historians saw the preemptive strike as a necessary one, "saving the lives of hundreds", while others see it as a sad misunderstanding. Speaking shortly after the 150th anniversary of the colony, historian Charles Francis Adams summarized the Wessagusset experience as "ill-conceived, "ill-executed, ill-fated".
Second Wessagusset colony.
At approximately the same time, the Plymouth Council for New England was sponsoring a new colony for New England. A patent for a settlement covering of what is now north-east of Boston Bay was given to an English captain and son of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Robert Gorges. This settlement was intended to be a spiritual and civil capital of the council's New England colonies. Gorges was commissioned as Governor-General with authority over Plymouth and presumably future colonies. His government was also to consist of a leadership council, of which Plymouth's Governor Bradford would be a member. Unlike Weston, who had brought only working men, Gorges brought families intending for a permanent settlement. And unlike the Puritans, Gorges brought the Church of England with him, in the form of two clergymen who would oversee the spiritual health of the region.
Gorges arrived in Massachusetts in September 1623, only four months after Weston's colony collapsed. Instead of founding his colony at the location described in the patent, he instead chose the abandoned settlement at Wessagusset for his site. It was rechristened Weymouth after Weymouth, Dorset, the town where the expedition began. Over the following weeks, he visited Plymouth and ordered the arrest of Thomas Weston who had arrived in that colony in the "Swan". This was his only official act as Governor-General. Weston was charged with neglect in his colony and with selling weapons were supposed to have been used for the defense of the colony. Weston denied the first charge, but confessed to the second. After consideration, Gorges released Weston "on his word" and he eventually settled as a politician in Virginia and Maryland.
After wintering in Weymouth, Gorges abandoned his new colony in the spring of 1624 due to financial difficulties. Most of his settlers returned to England, but some remained in as colonists in Weymouth, Plymouth, or Virginia. The remaining Weymouth settlers were supported by Plymouth until they were made part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop visited the settlement in 1632. In time, the location of the original settlement was lost to history and development. The location of the original fort was not rediscovered until 1891.

Redemptorists of Australia and New Zealand

The Redemptorists of Australia and New Zealand are a province within The Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Latin: Congregatio Sanctissimi Redemptoris – C.Ss.R or CSSR). The Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer is a Roman Catholic missionary order which was created in 1732 by Saint Alphonsus Liguori at Scala, near Amalfi, Italy for the purpose of labouring among the neglected country people in the neighbourhood of Naples.
Members of the order are known as Redemptorists. Priests and brothers work in more than 77 countries around the world.
History in Australia and New Zealand.
A number of requests for Australian foundations had been made to the Redemptorists before they came to these shores in 1882. In 1881, Bishop James Murray of Maitland finally had a breakthrough. It was the English Redemptorists who heard of his request and answered his call.
The leader of the group was Fr Edmund Vaughan, C.Ss.R. He was born in 1827 and was now 53 years of age. On their arrival in Sydney, the then Archbishop was Fr Vaughan’s nephew, the Benedictine, Roger Bede Vaughan, who welcomed them with largesse. On board with Fr Vaughan were two Irishmen, Fr Thomas O’Farrell and Fr James Hegarty, who would eventually take the Redemptorists to the Philippines.
Redemptorists first arrived in Australia and New Zealand in 1882 upon the request of Bishop James Murray of Maitland. Led by Fr Edmund Vaughan, C.Ss.R, a small group of priests boarded the Orient liner Sorata and set sail for Australia. They had brought with them picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, blessed in Rome by Pope Leo XIII.
The Redemptorists set up their first house in Singleton, New South Wales where the hot climate forced them to conduct summer missions in the cooler climate of New Zealand’s Dioceses. 
The Order soon took up residence in a new monastery at Mount St Alphonsus, Waratah, in Newcastle. In the first year at Waratah the community conducted 45 missions in ten dioceses through New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
The Redemptorists soon opened another Monastery in Ballarat 1888, serving as a base for missions in the southern states. With the Ballarat community taking caring for the south of Australia, the community at Waratah began to look the north. 
In 1889, the first missions were preached in Queensland. Missions began in Brisbane and its surrounding area, with their success convincing the Archbishop to extend the programme to the far flung country parishes. 
Once the Redemptorists were firmly established in Australia, permanent communities were founded in New Zealand. A Redemptorist mission in Canterbury scaled its operations down in the 1880s, leaving just two priests in Lyttleton. In 1898 the Redemptorists began operating from a homestead in Wellington where they worked for over 80 years. A church was built there in 1908, and expanded to form St Gerard's Monastery in 1931-1932.
In October 1898 the Redemptorists conducted a month-long mission in Perth. The mission was so well received that requests for further missions followed. This led to the construction of the monastery in North Perth which was blessed and opened in September 1903. One of the first Superiors was Dr. Patrick Clune, born in Clare, Ireland, 1863, who had been ordained in the Diocese of Goulburn in 1886 and had previously been rector of the Redemptorist monastery in Wellington, New Zealand. He would later become the first bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of Perth.
A Novitiate and House of Studies were built at Pennant Hills in Sydney, New South Wales, in 1924 to cater for the increased numbers of men wanting to join the Redemptorists. The Novitiate later moved to Galong, also in New South Wales. In 1935 a second Victorian house was opened at Kew, Melbourne.
A new house was created in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1945, followed by other foundations in Auckland and Dunedin
In 1927, The Redemptorist leaders in Rome created the Province of Australasia to include the houses of Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand became an independent Province in 1970.
Post-war Redemptorist activities include the development of the vice-provinces in the Philippines and in Singapore/Malaysia, the creation of several new houses on the east coast of Australia. The Redemptorists also became active as professors at Yarra Theological collage. 
The Redemptorists still are engaged in missionary activity in Australia and New Zealand. Redemptorists are actively involved in parish missions, preaching, retreats, adult education, teaching in universities, social justice work, counselling, accompaniment of indigenous communities, chaplaincies, devotions to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, working with people on the margins of society and promoting the family through the Majellan magazine.

Philly Improv Theater

Philly Improv Theater, or PHIT (pronounced "fit"), is a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania comedy theater which produces and presents shows at The Shubin Theatre in Philadelphia's South Street Headhouse District. The theater also operates a training center with programs in improv comedy and sketch comedy. PHIT's most notable alumnus is stand-up comedian Kent Haines, who was the 2008 winner of the Philly's Phunniest contest at Helium Comedy Club and has appeared on public radio show The Sound of Young America and Season 4 of Comedy Central's program Live at Gotham. In addition to Haines, other comedians from Philadelphia who appeared on stage at PHIT have gone on to perform at major comedy venues in cities like New York and Los Angeles, founded their own theatre companies, and appeared in touring productions for The Second City.
History.
PHIT was founded as a nonprofit in October 2005 by Greg Maughan, with assistance from local improvisers Bobbi Block, Matt Holmes and Alexis Simpson. The original purpose of the theater was to offer improv comedy instruction for beginning to advanced students. Over time PHIT expanded its mission to include sketch comedy instruction, and became an important presenter and producer for all varieties of alternative comedy shows. Viewers of Philadelphia's local FOX affiliate, WTXF-TV, voted PHIT as the city's Best Comedy Club in their 2009 Hot List competition.
Productions.
PHIT hosts improv, sketch, stand-up, and variety comedy shows, as well as occasional movie screenings. The theater produces monthly performances by five improv comedy house teams (Mayor Karen, Davenger, The Future., Big Baby and Dr. Sleepover), as well as independent improv and sketch groups. Also on PHIT's regular schedule are several stand-up showcases (Hey Everybody! and Chip Chantry's One Man Show With Special Guests), an improv competition decided by audience vote (Cagematch), a "found comedy" night (TV Party and Guilty Pleasures), a hybrid "sketch-prov" talk show in the style of The Jerry Springer Show (The Gross Show), a sketch open mic called Sketch Up or Shut Up, and an open improv jam. PHIT has also presented shows by performing groups from New York's Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, Magnet Theater, and The Peoples Improv Theater; and individuals including Kevin Allison of MTV's The State, Susan Messing of Chicago's Annoyance Theater, and Dave Hill.
From March 2006 until January 2008, PHIT produced a monthly improv comedy show at Fergie's Pub in Philadelphia's Center City. Since January 2007,the theater has hosted regular performances at The Shubin Theatre, in addition to producing additional shows at others venues. In 2009, the theater produced a weekend of shows collectively titled "Philly Invades NYC" at Under Saint Marks' in New York City.
Philly Fringe Festival.
PHIT has participated in the Philadelphia Live Arts and Philly Fringe Festival every year since 2006. In 2008, the theater programed performances by improv and sketch comedy groups on all 16 days of the festival, anchoring these shows around an original improv-to-script musical comedy titled "The Hoppers Hit the Road". The production garnered considerable attention and positive reviews in mainstream local media, including a review by The Philadelphia Inquirer. During the 2009 festival, the theater presented an ambitious schedule of performances - this time in the Fringe Festival's newly created Improv/Comedy category.
Training program.
Since its inception, the theater has offered a core curriculum of classes teaching basic to advanced improvising techniques. PHIT's curriculum is based heavily on similar programs at Chicago's Second City Training Center and iO (formerly ImprovOlympic), and New York's Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. In February 2009, PHIT introduced a similar core curriculum in sketch comedy writing. PHIT uses local performers as instructors for its improv core curriculum, and a mix of local and nationally recognized teachers (including Kevin Allison of MTV's The State and former Saturday Night Live writer Ali Farahnakian) for its sketch comedy program.

United States presidential election in Montana, 2008

The 2008 United States presidential election in Montana took place on November 4, 2008 throughout all 50 states and D.C., which was part of the 2008 United States presidential election. Voters chose 3 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
Montana was won by Republican nominee John McCain by a 2.38% margin of victory. Before the election, Montana was initially viewed as safe republican, but was viewed as lean republican or toss-up in the final weeks. Historically the state is a Republican stronghold, but polls during the 2008 election showed Democrat Barack Obama just narrowly trailing Republican John McCain. On election day, McCain narrowly carried Montana. Like 2004, this state had a strong showing among third party and independent candidates, as Ron Paul received over 2% of the vote, possibly taking away conservative votes from McCain. It was the fourth closest state in the nation, behind Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana.
Campaign.
Predictions.
There were 17 news organizations who made state by state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day:
Polling.
Although Republican George W. Bush of Texas carried the Treasure State by double digits in both 2000 and 2004, polls taken throughout July indicated a close race between Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrat Barack Obama of Illinois. When Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was announced as McCain's running mate in late August, however, McCain took a double-digit lead in the state that lasted until the middle of October, when polling once again showed the two candidates within striking distance of each other in the state. When the actual 2008 presidential election took place, McCain carried the state by about 2.26 percentage points. The state's results were significantly closer than they were in the 2004 election when George W. Bush carried the state by a margin of 20 points.
Fundraising.
John McCain raised a total of $386,940 in the state. Barack Obama raised $1,089,874.
Advertising and visits.
Obama and his interest groups spent $1,732,467. McCain and his interest groups spent just $134,805. The Democratic ticket visited the state 3 times and McCain didn't visit the state.
Analysis.
Montana, a Republican-leaning state, has voted for the Republican presidential nominee in every election since 1968 except in 1992 when the state slightly preferred Democrat Bill Clinton to Republican George H. W. Bush.
Obama did very well among the Democratic base of Montana, which consists of three sections. Students in Missoula County, which is home to the University of Montana, helped him win a three-to-two margin there. In the southwest, Obama won more than 65% of the vote in Deer Lodge County and Silver Bow County - Democratic strongholds which have voted Republican only twice since 1912. Finally, Native Americans gave Obama strong support; in the eastern part of the state, Obama only won counties in which Native Americans composed at least 30% of the population.
McCain's base was in the eastern part of the state, which is less unionized and more rural. It is home to more ranchers and less miners than elsewhere. Only five counties voted Democratic in the east. In Western Montana, McCain generally won wherever Obama's Democratic base was lacking. His biggest margins came from the region bordering the GOP bastion of Idaho.
There was also a relatively high third-party vote, totaling around four percent. The Montana Constitution Party ran libertarian-leaning Republican U.S. Representative Ron Paul of Texas on their line (against his wishes), winning 2.17% of the vote in Montana, which was the highest statewide percentage total for any third-party candidate in the 2008 presidential election. A significant number of write-in candidates also ran in the state, with some beating third-party candidates.
During the same election, incumbent Democratic Governor Brian Schweitzer was reelected to a second term in a landslide over Republican Roy Brown and Libertarian Stan Jones. Winning by more than a two-to-one margin, Schweitzer received 65.21% of the vote while Brown took in 32.77% and Jones got 2.03%. At the state level, however, Republicans picked up three seats in the Montana Senate and gained control of the chamber. Democrats picked up the office of Secretary of State.
Results breakdown.
By congressional district.
Due to the state's low population, only one congressional district is allocated, the At-Large District. This district covers the entire state, and thus is equivalent to the statewide election results.
Electors.
Technically the voters of Montana cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Montana is allocated 3 electors because it has 1 congressional district and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 3 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 3 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.
The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.
The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 3 were pledged to John McCain and Sarah Palin:

United States presidential election in Nevada, 2008

The 2008 United States presidential election in Nevada was part of the 2008 United States presidential election, which took place on November 4, 2008 throughout all 50 states and D.C.. Voters chose 5 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
Nevada was won by Democratic nominee Barack Obama with a 12.5% margin of victory. Both campaigns heavily campaigned here in 2008, as although Obama held a lead in the polls, it was not unreasonable to think that John McCain, a nationally prominent Senator from neighboring Arizona had a legitimate chance of having Nevada swing to his corner. Most news organization considered the state as Obama would win, or a blue state, but some still considered it as a swing state during the last week of the election. In the past four presidential elections, the margin of victory has always been below 5 percentage points. George W. Bush carried Nevada twice in 2000 and 2004 while Bill Clinton won the Silver State both times as well in 1992 and 1996. With the anti-Republican sentiment growing nationwide and the fact that personally, McCain barely campaigned in Nevada, Nevada swung wildly into the Democratic column in 2008 as Barack Obama carried the state by 12.50 points over John McCain, receiving 55.15% of the total statewide vote to McCain's 42.65%. It was the first time since 1988 that the margin of victory was in double digits.
Campaign.
Predictions.
There were 17 news organizations who made state by state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day:
Polling.
In the beginning of the general election, it was a dead heat. McCain did win several polls. However since September 30, Obama swept every other poll taken in the state and tied one poll. The final 3 polls averaged 50% to 44% in favor of Obama. On election day, Obama won the state with 55% and by a double digit margin of victory, a much better performance than polls showed, including the most accurate pollster Rasmussen Reports.
Fundraising.
John McCain raised a total of $1,980,771 in the state. Barack Obama raised $2,328,659.
Advertising and visits.
Obama and his interest groups spent $9,622,022. McCain and his interest groups spent $6,184,427. Each campaign visited the state 7 times.
Analysis.
Nevada is a swing state that has voted for the winner of every presidential election since 1912 with the sole exception of 1976 when the state voted for Republican Gerald Ford over Democrat Jimmy Carter. In 2008, McCain of neighboring Arizona was leading most polls taken March until the end of September (around the time of the 2008 financial crisis), when Obama of Illinois started taking a lead in almost every poll conducted from the beginning of October on, some of which in double-digits. The subprime mortgage crisis hit Nevada hard, and McCain's statement that "the fundamentals of the economy are strong" undoubtedly hurt him in a state that was devastated by the economic meltdown.
When the actual 2008 election came, Obama carried the Silver State by a very safe margin of 12.50 percentage points, larger than most polls anticipated. This was due almost entirely to Obama winning the state's three largest jurisdictions: Clark County, home to Las Vegas; Washoe County, which contains Reno; and the independent city of Carson City, which combine for 88% of Nevada's total population. Hispanics also played a large role in Obama's landslide victory. According to exit polling, they composed 15% of voters in Nevada and broke for Obama by a three-to-one margin. With their support, Obama carried Washoe County by a comfortable 12-point margin and a somewhat narrower one-point margin in Carson City. These two areas hadn't gone Democratic since Lyndon B. Johnson won them in 1964. Obama also won Clark County by double-digits, the first time a Democrat won the county by more than single-digits since 1964. McCain ran up huge margins in most of the more rural counties, which have been solidly Republican for decades. However, it was not nearly enough to overcome his deficit in Clark, Washoe and Carson City. Indeed, Obama's 122,000-vote margin in Clark County would have been enough by itself to carry the state.
At the same time, Democrats picked up a U.S. House seat in Nevada's 3rd Congressional District, which is based in Clark County and consists of most of the Las Vegas suburbs. Democratic State Senator Dina Titus defeated incumbent Republican Jon Porter by 5.14 points with several third parties receiving a small but significant proportion of the total statewide vote. At the state level, Democrats picked up one seat in the Nevada Assembly and picked up two seats in the Nevada Senate, giving the Democrats control of both chambers of the Nevada Legislature for the first time in decades.
Results breakdown.
By congressional district.
Barack Obama carried two of the state’s three congressional districts both held by Demorats while John McCain carried the one and only congressional district held by a Republican.

Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 8)

Season eight of "Dancing with the Stars" premiered on Monday, March 9, 2009, as part of ABC's spring line-up. The show generally followed the format of previous seasons, with 13 couples, although there were some changes, including two new dances (Argentine Tango and Lindy Hop), and an occasional dance-off between the bottom two couples, in order to determine who will be eliminated. The show was again hosted by Tom Bergeron and Samantha Harris. Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba all returned as judges again this season.
Originally, the season was advertised as the first U.S. season where a husband and wife would compete against each other: rodeo champion Ty Murray and singer-songwriter Jewel. The two had married the previous year after a ten-year courtship. However, just prior to the series, Jewel fractured both her tibias and was unable to perform. She was replaced on the show by Playboy model Holly Madison. Murray chose to continue on the show, and Jewel appeared during the season as a special musical guest.
Nancy O'Dell, the then co-host of "Access Hollywood", was also originally announced to be on the show, but was forced to withdraw from the competition due to a torn meniscus, which required surgery. She was replaced by Melissa Rycroft, a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader who won season 13 of "The Bachelor". She only had two days to practice her first dance.
Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson won the competition, beating actor Gilles Marini by less than 1%. She is the youngest champion and second youngest competitor on the series.

Vishnupad Mandir

The Vishnupada Mandir () is the 220 year old temple in Gaya, India. It is a Hindu temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
This temple is located along the Falgu River, marked by a footprint of Lord Vishnu known as Dharmasila, incised into a block of basalt. The Bhumihar Brahmins have been the traditional priests at Vishnupad Mandir in Gaya as "Gayawar Pandas" and in the adjoining districts like Hazaribagh. Several legendary saints as Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sankaradeva and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu have visited this shrine. 
History and location.
The construction date of temple is unknown and it is believed that Rama along with Sita had visited this place. The present day structure was rebuilt by Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar, the ruler of Indore, in 1787, on the banks of the Falgu river. A flight of 1000 stone steps leads to the top of the Brahmajuni hill, 1 km southwest of the Vishnupad mandir. Visitors prefer to go to the top of Brahmajuni hill see magnificent view of temple from top. There are many small temples near this temple.
Once a demon known as Gayasura, did a heavy penance and sought a boon that whoever see him should attain salvation (Moksham). Since salvation is achieved through being righteous in one's lifetime, people started obtaining it easily. To prevent immoral people from attaining salvation Lord Vishnu asked Gayasura to go beneath the earth and did so by placing his right foot on asura's head. After pushing Gayasura below the surface of earth, Lord Vishnu's foot print remained on the surface that we see even today. The footprint consists of nine different symbols including Shankam, Chakram and Gadham. These are believed to be weapons of the lord. Gayasura now pushed into earth pleaded for food. Lord Vishnu gave him a boon that every day, someone will offer him food. Whoever does so, their souls will reach heaven. The day Gayasura doesn't get food, it is believed that he will come out. Every day, one or the other from different parts of India will pray for welfare of his departed and offer food, feeding Gayasura.
Architecture.
This is believed that the temple was built with the footprints of Lord Vishnu in the centre. In Hinduism, this footprint marks the act of Lord Vishnu subduing Gayasur by placing his foot on his chest. Inside the Vishnupad Mandir, the 40 cm long footprint of Lord Vishnu is imprinted in solid rock and surrounded by a silver plated basin. The height of this temple is 30 meter and it a has 8 rows of beautifully carved pillars which support the pavilion. The temple is built of large gray granite blocks jointed with iron clamps. The octagonal shrine faces east. Its pyramidal tower rises up a 100 feet. The tower has sloping sides with alternately indented and plain sections. The sections are set at an angle to create a series of peaks joined at the top. Within the temple stands the immortal banyan tree "Akshayabat" where the final rituals for the dead takes place.

History.
WQBB started as a country outlet as WGUD, flipping to top 40 hits outlet as WXYK - 105.9 KISS FM until 1997 when 105.9 FM, 96.7 FM and 107.1 FM switched frequencies. KISS FM went to the 107.1 FM frequency. And then classic rock moved from the 96.7 FM frequency to the 105.9 FM frequency as Classic Rock 105.9 WXRG. As of 2006 105.9 became WHGO - 105.9 GO FM as classic hits. In 2009, It has since leaned back to a true Classic Rock format, and is once again known as Classic Rock 105.9.
On October 4, 2010 the station went off the air and was replaced by a Microsoft Sam voice reciting a countdown of the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until October 8, while interspersing a random movie quote or song lyric a few times each minute. This affected both the station's normal over-the-air frequency as well as its online stream. 
On October 8, 2010 at 3:00 pm CDT, WHGO relaunched as an adult hits station, branded as "Bob 105.9" with a new call sign of WQBB.

Fun Things

The Fun Things were a high energy punk band that was formed during the heyday period of punk rock. Known for their admiration of Radio Birdman, they also have been documented as being "modeled on almost exclusively on the Radio Birdman / Stooges / Sex Pistols mould". Original band members were Brad Shepherd on guitar and vocals, John Hartley on bass guitar, Graeme Beavis on guitar and Murray Shepherd on drums. Brad Shepherd and Murray Shepherd were brothers in the band, which released one highly acclaimed E.P. and has become "one of the most collectable artifacts from Australia’s punk rock era".
According to music historian, Ian McFarlane, Brisbane produced "some of the most anarchistic bands of the Australian punk rock era" and that it was a city nationally renowned for its ultra conservatism. After The Fun Things dissolved both Shepherd brothers eventually went on to subsequent profile bands such as The Hitmen, The Hoodoo Gurus for Brad Shepherd and The Screaming Tribesmen for Murray Shepherd with John Hartley. In 1984 Beavis was a member of The Apartments.
History.
The Fun Things existed between 1979 to 1980, however, they were previously known as The Aliens in Brisbane during 1978. Coincidentally, there was another band called The Aliens from Adelaide at the same time. This other band were considered more New Wave orientated. The Brisbane punk rock “Aliens” members featured Brad Shepherd on guitar and vocals, bassist John Hartley, and Murray Shepherd on drums but dissolved to form the Phantom Agents for a phase without Hartley.
After the Phantom Agents, The original Aliens reformed as The Fun Things with The Phantom Agents guitarist Graeme Beavis. This outfit rapidly gained a strong local following, which was due to their tight and energetic live shows.
The Fun Things were still teenagers but managed to record a self titled E.P. in 1980. Brad Shepherd recollections of this period were, “It was just part of the punk process. It was something you wanted to do. We were still at school at the time. I borrowed 400 bucks from my parents in order to make the thing happen”. The songs were “mixed gutsy guitar riffs, breakneck tempos, punk attitude and youthful exuberance in equal measure,” according to Ian McFarlane. In 2000 the EP was re-released on Pennimann Records from Spain. Some of the tracks in the past had been subject to bootlegging from outside Australia. 
The Fun Things earliest beginnings started in the mid 1970s with Brad Shepherd and John Hartley meeting each other to practice at their homes. According to Brad Shepherd, they used to practice Zeppelin and Sabbath and Deep Purple songs in Hartley's rumpus room, or at his place. He lived at The Gap, which is in the western suburbs of Brisbane and Hartley lived at Tarragindi, which is South. They were 14 at the time so they would get their mothers to drive them to each other's place and practice on Sunday afternoons. They did that for a couple of years until Shepherd started reading in RAM (Rock Australia Magazine) about Radio Birdman.
The band split in 1980 at the time of their E.P. release, which was followed by Brad Shepherd joining The 31st, an alternative rock outfit from Brisbane. Later on he joined The Hitmen, then The Hoodoo Gurus. Murray Shepherd and Hartley went to form The Screaming Tribesmen in 1981 with Mick Medew and Ronnie Peno from The 31st. Graeme Beavis went on join The Apartments in 1984.
Legacy.
Songs from the original E.P., "Savage" and "When The Birdman Fly" were included on several Australian CD compilations during the 2000s. Also during the early 2000s the Shepherd brothers formed a band called The Monarchs, which was loosely based on the Fun Things and Hitmen. A CD called "Make Yer Own Fun" was released by The Monarchs in 2001.

Haiyuan County

Haiyuan County () is a county under the administration of Zhongwei city in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China. It originally belonged to Gansu province. The county has a total area of , and a population of approximately 360,000 people. It was the site of the 1920 Haiyuan earthquake, which killed at least 200,000 people.
Characteristics.
Haiyuan County has many residents of the Hui ethnicity. They make up over 70 percent of the total population. Although agricultural development is important in the county, the arid climate, high alkaline content of the soil, and the course planting kernels make it difficult to retain moisture and fertility. Due to these characteristics, farmers in the county have begun to develop organic fennel in recent years. The county government is located in the town of Haicheng, and the county's postal code is 751800.

Infantile free sialic acid storage disease

Infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused when sialic acid, a kind of charged sugar, is unable to be transported out of the lysosomal membrane and instead, accumulates in the tissue and free sialic acid is excreted in the urine. Mutations in the SLC17A5 (solute carrier family 17 (anion/sugar transporter), member 50) gene cause all forms of sialic acid storage disease. The SLC17A5 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 6 between positions 14 and 15. This gene provides instructions for producing a protein called sialin that is located mainly on the membranes of lysosomes, compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials.
ISSD is the most severe form of the sialic acid storage diseases. Babies with this condition have severe developmental delay, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They may have unusual facial features that are often described as "coarse," seizures, bone malformations, enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly).
ISSD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder and affects 1 in 528,000 live births worldwide.
Symptoms.
Symptoms present by eight months of age and are marked by developmental delay followed by neurological complications such as seizures, involuntary eye movements, and ataxia, involuntary muscle movements and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Babies with this condition also have and enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) and enlarged heart (cardiomegaly).
Diagnosis and Testing.
A diagnosis can be made by measuring cultured tissue samples for increased levels of free sialic acid. Prenatal testing is also available for known carriers of this disorder.
Treatment.
There is no treatment for ISSD. Treatment is limited to controlling the symptoms of this disorder such as administering anti-convulsant medication to control seizure episodes.

Sphaerobolus

Sphaerobolus is a genus of fungi in the family Geastraceae. Commonly known as the "cannonball fungi", species discharge their spores with explosive force. Discharged spore sacs are sticky and have a tendency to strongly adhere to whatever surface they encounter, making them a nuisance to homeowners, pressure washing contractors, landscape mulch producers and insurance companies.
Taxonomy and classification.
The generic name is derived from the Greek words "sphaer", meaning "sphere", and "obolus", meaning "to throw". "Sphaerobolus" was first described by the Italian priest and biologist Pier Antonio Micheli (as "Carpobolus") in 1729. Formerly, the genus was formerly placed either in its own family, the Sphaerobolaceae, in the order Sclerodermatales, or, more commonly, in the order Nidulariales.
Currently, the genus is placed in the family Geastraceae.
Recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that "Sphaerobolus" should be placed in the gomphoid-phalloid clade along with related genera like "Geastrum", "Phallus", "Pseudocolus", "Ramaria", "Clavariadelphus", "Gomphus" and "Gautieria". Within the genus, three highly supported clades may be discerned, corresponding to "S. stellatus", "S. iowensis", and the recently described taxon "S. ingoldii".
Description.
Fruiting bodies, which grow in groups, are 1–3 mm in diameter, roughly spherical or ovoid in shape, and white to buff in color. The peridium (outer wall) consists of several layers, including a gelatinous layer. At maturity, the exoperidium (outermost layer) splits into several lobes to expose the dark brown, single peridiole (spore casing). The peridiole is forcibly ejected (sometimes up to several feet), leaving an evaginated endoperidium. Spores are typically 6–10 x 4–6 µm, elliptical to oblong in shape, thick-walled, and hyaline. Species have a cosmopolitan distribution, and are usually found on dung, decaying wood (such as landscaping mulch), or vegetative litter.
Mechanism of spore discharge.
The peridium, which consists of six distinct layers, forms two "cups" at maturity. Three layers form the outer cup, two form the inner cup, and one layer dissolves to create the fluid that bathes the gleba. After splitting of the peridal layers to expose the gleba, enzymatic conversion of glycogen to glucose increases the internal osmotic pressure and the turgidity of palisade cells in the inner peridial cup. Analysis of the glebal carbohydrates revealed an increase in glucose, mannitol, and trehalose prior to glebal discharge, which would account for the increase in osmotic pressure. Glebal discharge typically occurs 5–6 hours after the apex has split. In "S. stellatus", the gleba may be thrown up to 6 meters horizontally. This species is phototropic, and the nearest source of direct or reflected light will be the target for glebal discharge.

The Jesenice Mosque (, ) is a Sunni mosque located in the town of Jesenice, Slovenia, on "Viktor Kejžar" street, no 19. It is the center of the Jesenice jamaat. 
Many Muslims were among the wave of migrants from other Yugoslav republics attracted to Jesenice by steel-industry jobs in the 1960s and 70s. In the 2002 census, 18% of the population of Jesenice were listed as Muslim, the highest percentage of any single municipality in Slovenia.
The first Islamic observances in Jesenice took place in July 1969, when Mawlid was celebrated in a temporary hall in the train station. The current mosque was bought in 1988, and its first governing community board established in October 1989. The building was renovated to its present appearance in 1992, when an 80 cm minaret was also added.
The Jesenice jamaat serves the area of Jesenice, Bled, Radovljica, Žirovnica, Kranjska Gora, Bohinjska Bistrica and Lesce with a total Muslim population of over 5,000, mostly hailing from Western Bosnia, the Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo.

Vajreshvari

The Shree Vajreshwari Devi Mandir is a Hindu temple dedicated to the goddess Vajreshvari, located in the town Nagarkot, in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India.
Location.
The temple of Vajreshvari is located in the town of Nagarkot, Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh, India and is 11 km away from the nearest railway station of Kangra. The Kangra Fort is situated nearby. Its location on a mountain near Chamunda Devi temple, is 16 km from Nagarkot.
Legends.
The primary deity of the temple, Vajreshvari (vajreśvari), also spelled Vajreshvari, also known as Vajrábái and Vajrayogini, is considered an incarnation of goddess Parvati or Aadi-Maya on earth. Her name literally means "the lady of the Vajra (thunderbolt)". There are two legends about the goddess' origins, both associated with the Vajra.
Thousands of years ago, a Rakshasa (demon) named Kalikala or Kalikut troubled the rishis (sages) and humans in the region of Vadvali and waged a war against the devas (gods). Distressed the gods and sages headed by Vashishta performed the Chandi yajna, a fire offering to the Goddess, to please Her. An "aahuti" (offering of ghee in yajna) was not granted to Indra (king of devas). Enraged, Indra hurled his Vajra - one of most powerful weapons in Hindu mythology- at the yajna. The terrified gods and sages prayed to the Goddess to save them. The Goddess appeared in all her glory at the site and not only swallowed the Vajra and humbled Indra but also killed the demons. Rama requested the Goddess that she should stay in the region of Nagarkot and be known as Vajreshvari. Thus, the Vajreshvari temple was established in this region.
Another legend says that Indra and other devas went to goddess Parvati and requested her to help slay the demon Kalikala. Goddess Parvati assured that she would come to their aid at the right time and ordered them to fight with the demon. In the battle, Kalikala swallowed or broke all weapons thrown at him. Finally, Indra threw the Vajra at the demon, which Kalikala broke into pieces and from the Vajra, emerged the Goddess, who destroyed the demon. The devas extolled her as Vajreshwari and built her temple.
Another legend says that after Goddess Sati sacrificed herself in the honor of Lord Shiva in her Fathers Yagya. Shiva took her body on his shoulder and started Tandav. In order to stop him from destroying the world Lord Vishnu divided the body of Sati into 52 parts with his Chakra. The left breast of Sati fell at this spot, thus making it a Shakti Peeth.
History.
The original temple was built by the Pandavas at the time of Mahabharatha. Legend says that one day Pandavas saw Goddess Durga in their dream in which she told them that she is situated in the Nagarkot village and if they want them self to be secure they should make a temple for her in that area otherwise they will be destroyed. That same night they made a magnificent temple for her in the Nagarkot village. This temple was looted a number of time by the Muslim invaders. Md Gaznavi looted this temple at least 5 times, in the past it used to contain tonnes of gold and many ghantas made of pure silver. In 1905 the temple was destroyed by a powerful earthquake and was subsequently rebuilt by the government.
Temple structure.
The main gate entrance has a Nagarkhana or drum house and is built similar to the Bassein fort entrance. The temple is also surrounded by a stone wall like a fort.
Inside the main area Goddess Vajreshvari is present in the form of Pindi. The temple also have a small temple of Bhairav. In front of the main temple an idol of Dhayanu Bhagat is also present. He had offered his head to the Goddess at the time of Akbar. The present structure has three tombs in it, which is unique in itself.
Temple festivals.
The temple celebrates Navaratri once from the first day of fortnight of waxing moon of the Hindu month of Chaitra (March) to the ninth day of Ram Navami and then from the first day of the bright half of the Hindu month of Ashvin (October) to the 10th day Vijayadashami.
A huge fair in honour of Goddess Vajreshwari is held on Amavasya (new moon day) in the month of Chaitra. The fair commences on the 14th day of fortnight of waning moon of the month with ceremonial worship of the Goddess. On Amavasya at night, lamps are worshipped. On the next day, the first day of Hindu month Vaisakha, the ceremonial procession with a Palkhi (palanquin) carrying an image of the goddess, is taken out.
Other festivals the temple celebrates are Shiva worship in Hindu month of Shravana; Kojagiri Poornima - full moon day of Hindu month Ashvin; Diwali (festival of lights); Holi (festival of colours); Datta Jayanti (birthday of the deity Datta); Hanuman Jayanti (birthday of monkey god Hanuman) and Godhadebuwa Jayanti (birthday of the saint Godhadebuwa).
Makar sakrantri, which comes on second week of January, is also celebrated in the temple. Legend says that after killing Mahishasura in the battle, devi had got some injuries. to heel those injuries Goddess had applied Makhan (butter) on her body, in Nagarkot. Thus to mark this day the Pindi of Goddess is covered with Makhan and the festival is celebrated for a week in the temple.
Administration.
The temple is taken care of by the government of India.

Peter Golenbock

Peter Golenbock (born July 19, 1946) is a sports journalist and author. He has written nine New York Times best sellers including "Dynasty The New York Yankees 1949-1964", "The Bronx Zoo" (with Sparky Lyle), "Number 1" (with Billy Martin), "Balls" (with Graig Nettles), "Personal Fouls", "Idiot" (with Johnny Damon), "Presumed Guilty" (with Jose Baez), "American Prince" (with Tony Curtis), and "Driven" (with Donald Driver).
Golenbock was working as an editor for Prentice-Hall in the summer of 1972 when he knocked on the door of Nick D'Incecco, the head of P-H's trade book division, and told D'Incecco he wanted to write a history of the Casey Stengel New York Yankees. D'Incecco liked the idea and incredibly gave him a contract almost on the spot. Golenbock interviewed almost all of the Yankees of that era (including Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Casey Stengel, Whitey Ford, Roger Maris, Ralph Houk, and Yogi Berra). Billy Martin so loved what Golenbock wrote in Dynasty that he asked him to write his autobiography, Number 1.
As a result Golenbock continued to write books on the Yankees - "The Bronx Zoo" (a 1979 release written with pitcher Sparky Lyle), "Balls" (with third baseman Graig Nettles), and "Number 1" (with manager Billy Martin), to name a few. He covered the old Brooklyn Dodgers teams in "" (which won the 1984 CASEY Award for the best baseball book of the year). He also has written books on NASCAR, the New York Mets, and the Boston Red Sox (his 1992 "Fenway: An Unexpurgated History of the Boston Red Sox" was updated and re-released in 2005 as "Red Sox Nation").
Golenbock also has written on collegiate athletics. "Personal Fouls - The Broken Promises and Shattered Dreams of Big Money Basketball at Jim Valvano's North Carolina State" revisited 1980s college basketball and focused on Jim Valvano and the NC State University basketball team. Valvano did all he could to stop publication of the book, threatening to sue Simon and Schuster and Golenbock for $250 million. S&S dropped it, and it was picked up by small publisher Carroll and Graf. Within a week of publication the school chancellor Bruce Poulson retired, and Valvano later was fired first as athletic director and as basketball coach. The book prompted an NCAA investigation which whitewashed Valvano, but found that free tickets and shoes properly issued to players, were then sold for monetary gain by those players. Personal Fouls revealed that in eight years only one of Valvano's players had graduated. The publication helped spark a revolution in college athletics with educators and administrators passing rules to try to insure that college athletes leave school with an education and not just a pile of press clippings. 
Golenbock next wrote an award-winning children's book entitled Teammates, which described an incident during Jackie Robinson's first season as a Brooklyn Dodger when he was publicly befriended by teammate Pee Wee Reese, a Southerner who believed Robinson had just as much right to be playing as anyone. Teammates was selected by Redbook Magazine as one of the ten-best children's books of 1990. It is still being used in schools across America today to foster racial relations.
Golenbock then published The Forever Boys, an intimate look at the lives of former major league ballplayers as they attempted to recapture former glory in the Senior Professional Baseball League. Golenbock spent the 1989-90 season with the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the senior league as he wrote an intimate book about the joys and hardships of playing baseball on the professional level.
After writing Fenway, a sprawling, in-depth colorful history of The Boston Red Sox in 1991, he wrote American Zoom, an inside look at the multi-million dollar NASCAR stock car racing industry. It is to this date the best-selling book ever written about the sport.
In May 1994 St. Martin's Press published Wild, High, and Tight: The Life and Death of Billy Martin. Said Larry King in his column in USA Today, "It is one of the best biographies I have ever read." Robert Lipsyte in the New York Times said "It is the first nonfiction baseball book that reads like a Russian novel."
Golenbock's next books were Wrigleyville, an oral history of the Chicago Cubs, Cowboys Have Always Been My Heroes, an oral history of the Dallas Cowboys, and The Last Lap, a look at the men who lost their lives on the NASCAR racing circuit.
In the spring of 2000 Golenbock published The Spirit of St. Louis, an oral history of the St. Louis Cardinals and Browns. Golenbock also wrote a children's book about Hank Aaron's ordeal in breaking Babe Ruth's career home run record entitled Brave in Every Way. He followed that with Go Gators! an oral history of the University of Florida football team, and NASCAR Confidential with interviews with many of NASCAR's former heroes. In 2005 he published Idiot with Johnny Damon, an inside story of how the Red Sox won the World Championship in 2004.
Next came Miracle, the true-life saga of racing legend Bobby Allison. Golenbock then wrote 7: The Mickey Mantle Novel, a controversial look at the life of the great Yankee slugger. In 2008 Golenbock wrote In the Country of Brooklyn, a political and social history of the famed borough for HarperCollins. In late 2008 Golenbock released a biography on Hollywood screen actor Tony Curtis (co-written with Curtis), entitled "American Prince: A Memoir".
In the spring of 2009 Golenbock wrote George: The Poor Little Rich Boy who Built the Yankee Empire, a book he began in 1980, and in 2010 he worked with Humpy Wheeler, for many years the president of the Charlotte Motor Speedway on his autobiography, Growing Up NASCAR.
IN 2011 he wrote the controversial Presumed Guilty with Jose Baez, the attorney for Casey Anthony, who had been accused of killing her daughter. The book is the inside story of one of the first big cases tried entirely in the media. It describes how the case became a reality show in which truth and justice took a back seat to a prosecutor's need for publicity and fame.
In 2012, he co-authored the memoir of Larry Lawton, entitled "Gangster Redemption".
In 2013 he published Driven, with Green Bay Packer star received Donald Driver, an athlete who grew up in poverty in Houston, had to live in a UHaul trailer for several months, sold drugs to sustain himself, and who went on to Alcorn A&M and the Packers to fame and fortune. Driven was Golenbock's ninth New York Times best seller.
Golenbock was a radio sports talk show host in 1980 on station WOR in New York City. He was a color broadcaster for the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the Senior Professional Baseball League in 1989-90 and has been a frequent guest on many of the top television and radio talk shows including Biography on A&E, the Fiftiest Greatest Athletes on ESPN, and Yankeeography on the YES network.
Golenbock lives in St. Petersburg, Florida, with Wendy Sears Grassi, their cat Chauncey, and their Basset Hound Fred.

<doc id="20424709" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20424709" title="Meall Ghaordaidh">
Meall Ghaordaidh

Meall Ghaordaidh is a mountain in the Southern Highlands of Scotland, approximately 10 km north-west of Killin. 
The mountain can be ascended via Glen Lochay starting to the north-west of the Allt Dhùin Croisg near Duncroisk, via an eroded path leading north-west through peat bogs to the summit; alternatively, an ascent can be made from Glen Lyon starting at Stronuich via one of two spurs that lead to the summit (Creag an Tulabhain or Creag Laoghain). The summit is marked by a large circular rock windbreak, within which there is a trig point.
The name of the mountain has taken a few turns over the years. Centuries ago it was mapped as Bin-Gyroy. One-inch maps in the early 1900s referred to it as Meall Ghaordaidh, then for some reason it changed to Meall Ghaordie in the 1920s. The current Landranger reverts to Meall Ghaordaidh though the Munro Tables have consistently opted for Meall Ghaordie (though the Scottish Mountaineering Club guide to the Munros has it as being Meall Ghaordaidh).
Ghaordaidh could mean a part of the body such as the upper arm or shoulder, possibly from the Gaelic "gairdean," so may mean rounded hill of the shoulder, a description that could apply to many a hill. It is interesting to consider hill names and wonder what direction they were named from. It may have been the early inhabitants of Glen Lochay who named this one for, apart from its small area of summit crags, the southern slopes are broad and grassy. The old shielings on these lower slopes would support this idea. From the Glen Lyon side, however, meall is a misnomer. Three craggy spurs jut towards the glen – Creag an Tulabhain, Creag Laoghain and Creagan an t-Stuichd.
One of the less distinguished Munros, Meall Ghaordie is essentially a blunt nose that lifts itself above the rough moorland of the long, undulating ridge that stretches between the Lairig Breisleich and the Lairig nan Lunn; passes which connect Glen Lochay in the south with Glen Lyon in the north. The normal guidebook route follows the long grassy slopes from Glen Lochay to the south. An alternative route from Glen Lyon to the north is marginally more attractive, thanks to a couple of notable rocky spurs, Creag an Tulabhain and Creag Laoghain. Unfortunately, given that this mountain shall be the first climbed on the week of our caravan trip to Killin, and an evening climb to boot, we shall be doing the straightforward ascent from Glen Lochay.
A long trudge of some 890 metres (2,700feet) from Duncroisk follows grassy slopes, the monotony of which is only broken by some rocky outcrops near the summit ridge. From the summit of Meall Ghaordie, a northeast ridge drops to a high bealach from where steep slopes climb to the summit of the shapely Beinn nan Oighreag. From here another ridge stretches north above the Lairig Breisleich before dwindling out above the Lochan na Lairig road (the high- level road that runs past the Ben Lawers Visitor Centre) as it descends to Bridge of Balgie in Glen Lyon.
The Route:
1. There is space for about four cars a short distance past the bridge over Allt Dhuin Croisg on the road up Glen Lochay from Killin. Begin the walk by heading back along the road towards the bridge and then turning left through a gate signed for "Access to Meall Ghaordaidh" before reaching it. This leads onto a rough track up through the fields; follow this, crossing the stile to the right when the track goes through a gate in a grass-topped stone wall. 
2. The path continues uphill with the pretty little wooded ravine of the Allt Dhuin Croisg on the right. Higher up there are the remains of some old stone shielings, remnants of a bygone age. Frome these a worn path goes north-west (left) on what is, at first, the vague south-east ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh. Continue north-west on a good angle of ascent as the grassy ridge becomes more defined. 
3. The ascent is mostly grassy and wet in places. Continue in the same direction as the ridge becomes marginally better defined whilst an under-mapped craggy shoulder is reached at about 750 metres – care should be expressed here in misty conditions. Beyond the climb steepens for the final push up to the stony summit where a trig point can be found at 1039 metres, encircled by a stone wind-shelter. The views are good, particularly northwest over the head of Glen Lyon and its eponymous loch. 
4. If returning to Glen Lochay, the quickest route is to go back the same way. The Glen Lyon side of the mountain has a more interesting appearance as to this side Meall Ghaordaidh is buttressed by two rocky spurs, Creag Laoghain and Creag an Tulabhain. The ascent from here is a little tougher and requires more effort, usually being made via Coire Laoghain between the two spurs.

List of parishes in Cebu

The following is a list of parishes in Cebu, Philippines.
District I: Metro Cebu North.
Vicariate of the Most Holy Rosary.
San Vicente Ferrer Parish (1977).
Titular: San Vicente Ferrer, 2nd Sunday of May
Parish Priest: Rev. Generoso Pastidio, OFM
Vicariate of Nuestra Sra. Virgen dela Regla.
Sto. Niño de Cebu-Mactan Parish (1996).
Sto. Nino de Cebu - Mactan Parish started merely as a district of its mother parish - The Virgen dela Regla Parish (VDR). On August 15, 1996, through a petition, Fr. Mercurio "Cur" Montenegro, MSC, the parish priest of VDR that time, together with the lay leaders of Mactan District earnestly requested the Archbishop of Cebu, Ricardo Cardinal Vidal to transform the district into a parish. Thus, on August 26, 1996, the Cardinal signed the Episcopal Decree finally making the Mactan District a parish. The decree likewise defined its boundaries comprising the barangays of Mactan, Bankal, Buaya and Punta Engano. It was named Sto. Nino de Cebu - Mactan Parish as its Titular and Our Mother of Perpetual Help as its secondary patroness.
On September 8, 1996, Fr. Wim Noordermeer was installed as the first Parish Priest. Sadly, shortly after four months service as parish priest, he joined our Creator. Fr. Efren Fajardo, MSC, who was then his co-pastor, succeeded as the Parish Administrator. In his stint, Fr. Efren introduced the Parish Renewal Experience (PREX) Program with the aim of molding the spiritual formation and strengthening the Christian community.
The following year, on June 1997, Fr. Sabino "Ben", Roquero, MSC was installed second Parish Priest. He concentrated on the continuous construction of the church and facilitated various fund raising campaigns such as Dinner-For-A-Cause and the Islas Mactanos Cultural Show, as among others.
In 2001, emphasis was more on the organization of the parish music ministry. With great help from Fr. Ricky Bermudez, MSC, Parochial Vicar assigned in Mactan, who has a knack for music, he organized the Parish Composite Choir, which was later renamed Sto. Nino de Mactan Parish Music Ministry.
On July 1, 2002, Fr. Agustin P. Polong, MSC, became the third Parish Priest. Some of the programs and directions he introduced were the additional schedule of Holy Mass, introduction to the Holy Hour and devotion to the Sacred Heart. He also empowered the organization of the Parish Youth Coordinating Council (PYCC), the participation of the young girls in altar services and the implementation of Basic Ecclesial Community (BEC) being the thrust of the Archdiocese.
With the parish being a recipient of an award from the Archdiocese of Cebu as one of the Ten Outstanding Parishes in Catechetical Activities, they wish to cope with the challenge of manifesting its commitment to evangelization. In fact, in July 2005, the parish sought the support of Philippine Catholic Lay Mission (PCLM) for the implementation of the BEC Program of the Archdiocese.
As a growing Christian community, with an expanding base of thirty-five (35) recognized chapels and various committed religious / mandated organizations, the parish is as a testament of the loving care of the Holy Infant Jesus and infinite proof of the generosity, love, teamwork and devotion of God’s people.

<doc id="20425107" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20425107" title="Dutch 200">
Dutch 200

In ten-pin bowling, a Dutch 200 is a game in which the bowler records a score of 200 by getting strikes and spares in alternation throughout the game. Strikes, when thrown in the even-numbered frames, require six spares (strike then spare in the 10th frame). For strikes in the odd-numbered frames, five spares are needed, with a strike on the last shot of the game. When bowled in certified play, the certifying body may issue a patch or other award commemorating the feat.
The term is thought to originate from the phrase "Dutch treat" which is when two individuals share the cost of a date.
Traditionally, a Dutch 200 is one of the hardest games to bowl due to the alternation of the spares and strikes which gives each frame a score of 20. 
Related oddity.
Though unawarded, if a bowler can repeat the sequence of strike, strike, nine (first ball), missed spare (there is no spare attempt in the 10th frame) for a full game, the score will also be 200. For the first nine frames, the bowler will score 57 (29+19+9) every three frames, for 171, with 29 more in the 10th frame to total 200.

Lias Group

The Lias Group or Lias is a lithostratigraphic unit (a sequence of rock strata) found in a large area of western Europe, including the British Isles, the North Sea, the low countries and the north of Germany. It consists of marine limestones, shales, marls and clays.
In the past, the name Lias was often not only used for the sequence of rock layers, but also for the timespan during which they were formed. It was thus an alternative name for the Early Jurassic epoch of the geologic timescale. It is now known that the Lias is Rhaetian to Toarcian in age (over a period of ca. 20 million years between ) and thus also includes a part of the Triassic. The use of the name "Lias" for a unit of time is therefore slowly disappearing.
Subdivisions.
In southern England, the Lias Group is often divided into Lower, Middle and Upper subgroups. In Somerset the Lias is divided into the following formations (from top to base):
It is underlain by the Late Triassic Penarth Group, and overlain, after a stratigraphic hiatus, by the Early Cretaceous Upper Greensand Formation.
In Dutch lithostratigraphy, the name Lias has no official status, however, it is often used for the lower part of the Altena Group in the subsurface of the Netherlands and the southern North Sea.
In northern Germany, the Lias Group consists of nine formations (from top to base):

Nariman House

The Nariman House (), renamed as Chabad House ( ""), is a five-story landmark in the Colaba area in southern Mumbai, India. The building was home to a Chabad house, a Jewish outreach center run by Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg, and they have owned the Building since around 2006. The center had an educational center, a synagogue, offered drug prevention services, and a hostel. The building was attacked and six of its occupants, including Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg and his wife, Rivka, who was five months pregnant, were killed during the November 2008 Mumbai attacks by Pakistani Islamic terrorists. Their two-year-old son Moshe survived the attack after being rescued by his Indian nanny, Sandra Samuel.
Chabad House.
The Chabad House, located at 5 Hormusji Street, Colaba, is one of eight synagogues in Mumbai and has been described as the epicentre of the Jewish community in the city.
This Chabad House is one of 4,000 such houses in 73 countries, typically run by husband-and-wife couples. In 2003, this Chabad House, the first in Mumbai, was opened by Rabbi Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg, newly married, and until the November 2008 Mumbai attacks was run by them. It catered to Israelis who are on their way to "party hotspots" such as Goa and Rajasthan, in addition to the city's local Jewish community and traveling Jewish businessmen. The Holtzbergs also ran a synagogue and taught Torah classes, in addition to the rabbi conducting weddings for local Jewish couples. It is the Chabad headquarters for Mumbai. The place was open to anyone who wanted a place to pray, eat kosher food or celebrate Jewish holidays. In a film in 2006, Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg said that anyone who visited the center was welcome. It was not unusual for the Rabbi and his wife to have 30 people for dinner. Gavriel (born 1979, raised in Brooklyn, New York) and Rivka (born 1980 in Afula, Israel) Holtzberg came to Mumbai in 2003 after completing a mission in Thailand.
Three flights a week bring hundreds of Israeli travelers from Israel to Mumbai and in an interview Holtzberg said he understood the nature of their needs. The young rabbi, who was born in Israel but grew up in Brooklyn, said that they "need relief" from the army, from work, from real life. He said, "they come here to do everything the army didn't allow them to do. Their shoes had to be polished and tied—here they wear sandals. They had to cut their hair—here they grow their hair long."
In addition, "Jews from all nationalities stopped there—primarily Israelis, but also those from Singapore and other places. It was almost like a second home to them," said Elijah Jacob, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee's country manager for India. "Our country director used to say it was like a second home to him because of all of the Jews there on Shabbat."
Gavriel also helped with some of the local synagogues. He helped them gather donations, do fund-raising for the synagogue T'feret Israel, in central Mumbai in Jacobs Circle, and helped build a mikvah there. Also, he was officially a shochet, making chickens available to the local Jewish community, making challah for the community, and the couple was "available for the community," there to answer Halakhic principles of the local community.
Chabad officials said they were certain the Mumbai house would reopen, and within hours of news of the Holtzbergs' deaths, young Chabad couples from around the world offered to move to Mumbai to continue their work.
Services.
These are the services this Chabad House offered.
Attack.
The Chabad house was seized and attacked during the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. At around 2145 hours (9:45 pm) local time on Wednesday, 26 November, four terrorists took advantage of the fact that local security forces were operating in several locations throughout the city. Newscasters were calling it the "final assault", and the building is near the Leopold Cafe, another building attacked during the strike. However according to a new report Nariman House was actually the main target on 26 November and the rest of the targets were only to amplify the effect.
Initially it was reported that six Israeli Jews were being held hostage. Later Chabad spokesman in Israel Moni Ender said that there were at least eight Israelis inside the house, including Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka Holtzberg. The rabbi's two-year-old son Moshe was rescued by his nanny, Sandra Samuel, 44, who had worked for the centre for the previous five years.
The terrorists "would be told by their handlers in Pakistan that the lives of Jews were worth 50 times those of non-Jews." They were tortured very badly.
It was reported that gunmen fired indiscriminately towards the crowd. Late on Thursday evening, State officials in India told the Associated Press that eight hostages had been released from the Chabad House. Later Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said that the eight people seen near Chabad House were not Jewish hostages but local Indians from a home in the same compound. Early Friday morning a large blast was heard at the centre as fighting continued, even though other sources were reporting that the building was under the control of the Indian security forces.
During the siege US Chabad official Rabbi Levi Shemtov talked with one of the terrorists on Holtzberg's cell phone. The FBI and other negotiation experts helped guide him through the process, which included around five phone calls. Having to find an Urdu speaker to speak with him, they were unable to directly speak to any of the hostages, but Shemtov did say he heard the voice of one woman screaming in English, "please help immediately."
Shortly before dawn on Friday, Indian security forces began an attack on the Chabad House that lasted until after sundown. The operation began when 22 NSG Commandos rappelled out from an Indian Air Force Mi-17 helicopter on the roof of the building. NSG Commandos were in position in the adjacent buildings to provide cover fire to the assault team if needed. Commandos entered the building from the top and two loud blasts were heard followed by heavy gunfire. The whole operation was watched live on TV as news footage showed troops abseiling from a helicopter into the building, and soldiers on the ground closing in. Initially it was reported that five hostages were killed at the Chabad House, then six on Friday, eight by Saturday morning and the final number of six on Sunday, when two missing Israelis made contact with the Israeli Foreign Ministry. When the raid ended at sundown everyone inside the building was dead, including the rabbi and his wife. An Indian commando Havaldar Gajendra Singh Bisht was killed during the operation. According to ZAKA members, at least one hostage (Rabbi Holtzberg) might have been killed in the crossfire on Friday when the commandos moved in; this was rejected by government authorities as stories and irresponsible comments. Some of the victims had been bound. Some of the others were killed by the terrorists on Wednesday, and the remainder on Thursday. The rabbi's wife and Orpaz had been killed many hours before Nariman House was retaken. It is also believed that the Rabbi and his pregnant wife were sexually assaulted and their genitals were mutilated before they were killed.
A handout provided by Indian police identified the two terrorists killed at Nariman House as a certain "Nasir" alias Abu Umar, and "Babar Imaran".

Operation Bowler

Operation Bowler was an air attack on Venice harbour by Allied aircraft on 21 March 1945, as part of the Italian campaign of the Second World War. It was led by Acting Wing Commander, later Group Captain, George Westlake of the Royal Air Force.
By early 1945, northern Italy's rail and road network had undergone severe damage, forcing the Germans to resort to shipping goods into Venice and then moving them from there along rivers and canals. An attack on the city's harbour was thus deemed necessary by the Allied command, although the risk of damage to the city's architectural and artistic treasures was high, as it had always been in other battles of the Italian campaign, such as Battle of Monte Cassino. The operation was planned to be extremely precise to avoid any such damage and was named Operation Bowler by Air Vice-Marshal Robert Foster, as a reminder to those involved that they would be "bowler hatted" (returned to civilian life) or worse should Venice itself be damaged.
Having assessed the weather, Westlake led the attack in a Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk from No. 250 Squadron RAF, part of No. 239 Wing RAF, which was composed of Kittyhawk and P-51 Mustang squadrons and specialised in dive-bombing operations. The fighters attacked the gun defences of the docks and, that done, the bombers then dived in to the attack almost vertically to ensure precision, with civilian observers feeling safe enough to climb on the city's rooftops to observe the attack and with the only architectural damage being no more than a few broken windows. 
The attack sank two merchant ships as well as naval escorts and smaller vessels, as well as seriously damaging a large cargo ship and destroying five warehouses, an Axis mine stockpile (blowing a 100 yard hole in the quayside) and other harbour infrastructure, such as an underwater training establishment for frogmen and human torpedoes.
Westlake was recognised soon afterwards by being granted the Distinguished Service Order for "excellent leadership, great tactical ability and exceptional determination", having already won the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1942 for continuous gallantry in around 300 operational sorties.

<doc id="20425541" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20425541" title="Furtive fallacy">
Furtive fallacy

The furtive fallacy is an informal fallacy of emphasis in which outcomes are asserted to have been caused by the malfeasance of decision makers. Historian David Hackett Fischer identified it as the belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister, and that "history itself is a story of causes mostly insidious and results mostly invidious." It is more than a conspiracy theory in that it does not merely consider the possibility of hidden motives and deeds, but insists on them. In its extreme form, the fallacy represents general paranoia.
Fischer identifies several examples of the fallacy, particularly the works of Charles A. Beard. In each case, Fischer shows that historians provided detailed portrayals of historical figures involved in off-record meetings and exhibiting low morals, based on little or no evidence. He notes that the furtive fallacy does not necessarily imply deliberate falsification of history; it can follow from a sincere (but misguided) belief that nothing happens by accident or mistake.
Richard Hofstadter discussed the fallacy before Fischer, although not by name. In reviewing histories from the Progressive Era, Hofstadter noted that the progressive historians tended to assume that reality was always hidden and ignored, being determined by bribes, rebates, and secret business deals.
A modification of the furtive fallacy holds that when the historical record provides no evidence explaining a particular set of events, this is itself evidence of a furtive cause.
The idea of the furtive fallacy is criticized by Jeffrey M. Bale, who cites the risk of historians underestimating the influence of political secret societies, vanguard parties, and intelligence agencies.

Id file

Id files are plain text files containing a playful description of oneself.
Before the World Wide Web was invented, and long before social network services came into existence, people on BITNET used to send each other Id files as a way to introduce themselves. They were decorated in creative ASCII art (even if it actually was EBCDIC back then) and contained the typical personal information that a profile on a social network page would contain today. 
The term Id file comes from the filetype used on the IBM mainframe operating systems which were the most common BITNET hosts at the time. Your ID file would be named after your login or nickname (as in FRED ID—the name and type were separated by a space, not a dot). 
The file content often included machine-parsable data in a common IBM tagged format (colon tagname dot value, e.g. :name.Fred :location.Boston). Many users accumulated large collections of ID files for their online contacts, and interfaces to popular applications such as BITNET RELAY could access your Id files and their content during Instant Messaging (chat) sessions.

William Gentles

William Gentles (c1830–1878), a private in the U.S. Army, was identified as possibly the soldier who bayoneted the Oglala war leader Crazy Horse in 1877.
Early life.
William Gentles was born in County Tyrone, Ireland, though the date is not known for certain. Records suggest that he was born some time between 1828 and 1835. He may be the William Gentles born September 30, 1828, the son of Robert and Sarah Gentles. William Gentles immigrated to the United States in 1850, arriving in New York City where he worked as a laborer for several years.
Utah War.
On April 2, 1856, Gentles went in to the recruiting station in New York City and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was described in his enlistment record as 5 foot 8½ inches tall, with grey eyes, brown hair and a ruddy complexion.Private Gentles was assigned to Company K Tenth Infantry and sent to Fort Ridgely, Minnesota where he was stationed for the next year. 
The perception of a brewing rebellion in Utah Territory prompted President Buchanan to order a large military force west, including the entire Tenth Infantry, as part of the Utah Expedition. Private Gentles departed Fort Ridgely with his company on June 9, 1857 and arrived at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, two weeks later. They began marching west along the trail in July, finally reaching Fort Bridger in November. The loss of a supply train to Mormon raiders promised hardships for the soldiers as they settled into winter quarters at Smith's Fork nearby. Captain Randolph B. Marcy was ordered to make a dangerous trek south to Fort Massachusetts to obtain additional supplies and horses. When the volunteers were called for, Private William Gentles was one of those who stepped forward. They struggled through deep snow in the mountains and finally reached Fort Massachusetts in January 1858. They returned to Fort Bridger two months later.
Private Gentles was with his company in July 1858 when they moved through Salt Lake City and established Camp Floyd further south. The following month, they were transferred back to Fort Bridger where Gentles remained for the next two years. In June 1860, the company was transferred to Fort Laramie where Gentles completed his first enlistment and was discharged on April 1, 1861.
Civil War and Reconstruction.
As a civilian, William Gentles apparently settled in St. Joseph, Missouri. But with the Civil War engulfing the nation, Gentles again enlisted, this time in the 25th Regular Missouri Volunteers, which later became the 1st Regiment of Missouri Engineers. He was wounded in the hand at the Battle of Pilot Knob on September 27, 1862. Gentles completed his enlistment in 1864 and re-enlisted as a veteran volunteer. He was mustered out on July 22, 1865 in Louisville, Kentucky.
After the Civil War, Gentles returned to civilian life for two years, probably back in Missouri. Then on June 10, 1867, he enlisted in the Regular Army again. He was sent initially to the recruit depot at Newport Barracks, Kentucky and within days, he was assigned to Company F 45th Infantry and shipped to Tennessee where the regiment was on Reconstruction duty. In 1869, while stationed in Louisville, Kentucky, the army consolidated a number of the regiments and Gentles' company became Company F 14th Infantry.
Back in the West.
In the spring of 1870, the 14th Infantry was transferred to the Department of Dakota, with Private Gentles' company assigned to Fort Randall. Two weeks later, the company was sent down the Missouri to Fort Thompson near the Crow Creek Agency. On June 10, 1870, while camped near the agency, Private Gentles re-enlisted for his third enlistment. In August 1870, the regiment was transferred to the Department of the Platte. Marching on to the steamboat The Far West, famous six years later for evacuating the wounded from the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Company F arrived at Omaha Barracks, Nebraska, where they were stationed for the winter. Gentles was stationed with his company at Fort Fetterman, Wyoming, from March 1871 to September 1873 and then at Fort Sanders until February 1874.
In early 1874, troubles were brewing with the Oglala Lakota at the Red Cloud Agency in northwestern Nebraska. Following the killing of the agency clerk, the army sent a large contingent of troops to establish military posts near Red Cloud and the nearby Spotted Tail Agency. On February 15, 1874, Private Gentles and his company rode the train to Cheyenne and then marched north to Fort Laramie. Here they were met by other companies that then marched on to the Red Cloud Agency. Company F established a tent encampment near the agency where they remained for the next four months.
Shortly after returning to Fort Sanders, Private Gentles and Company F 14 Infantry were transferred to Camp Douglas, Utah Territory, arriving on September 5, 1874. Camp Douglas was named regimental headquarters for the 14th Infantry, under the command of Colonel John E. Smith. Most of the original log and adobe buildings at the post were in the process of being torn down and replaced by new red sandstone structures. For the next two years, the soldiers at Camp Douglas, including Private Gentles, were busy quarrying and hauling stone as well as other garrison duties. Gentles re-enlisted for his fourth enlistment while at Camp Douglas on June 10, 1875.
The Great Sioux War of 1876-77.
In May 1876, Brigadier General George Crook led his expedition north to engage northern bands of Lakota and Northern Cheyenne who had refused to come in to the reservations, part of the Great Sioux War of 1876-77. After being nearly defeated at the Battle of the Rosebud, Crook called for reinforcements and went into camp, awaiting their arrival. Meanwhile, the large village of Lakota and Cheyenne defeated Custer's command at the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25. 
Orders were issued for Companies B and F stationed at Camp Douglas to join Crook in the field. Traveling by train to Cheyenne, Private Gentles and his company marched north to Fort Fetterman where they departed on July 4, 1876 to find General Crook. Once all of the reinforcements had arrived, Crook's expedition set out again, following various Indians trails but failing to find the villages as the Lakota began to scatter. Running short of supplies, the column made a desperate push south to the Black Hills in what became the famous "Starvation March."
With the close of the campaign, Company F 14th Infantry was assigned to remain at Camp Robinson, Nebraska. During that fall, the troops patrolled the Sidney-Deadwood trail and engaged in normal post duties. During the spring of 1877, the soldiers at Camp Robinson witnessed the surrender of large bands of Northern Cheyenne and Lakota at the nearby Red Cloud Agency, culminating with the surrender of Crazy Horse on May 5, 1877.
Private Gentles' name appears in the post records in August 1877 when he was tried by a garrison court martial and sentenced to twenty days in the post guardhouse.
The Death of Crazy Horse.
On the evening of September 5, 1877, Crazy Horse was brought to Camp Robinson. During an attempt to place him in the guardhouse, there was a struggle and the famed Oglala war leader was fatally wounded. At the time, there was considerable confusion as to how he had been wounded but a member of the guard detail that evening, Private Edwin D. Wood, wrote that he saw a soldier bayonet Crazy Horse. Nearly all later eye witness accounts collected by various historians confirm that a soldier was responsible. The identity of that soldier, however, was questionable. No official army records note the name of the soldier.
In 1903, a former sergeant of the 14th Infantry, giving his name as William F. Kelly, told a "Washington Post" reporter what he had seen that evening at Camp Robinson. "It was an exciting moment, when no one knew just what to do," Kelly explained, recalling the struggle outside the guardhouse door between Crazy Horse and Little Big Man. "Suddenly, as the men surged forward in the direction of where I was standing, I saw Wm. Gentles, an old soldier and a veteran of the Mormon campaign of 1857, gave Crazy Horse a thrust with his bayonet. The thrust was delivered with lightning rapidity, and in the next instant he had his gun at carry, as though nothing had happened. Crazy Horse gave a deep groan, staggered forward and dropped his knife and fell."
Most writers have since accepted Sergeant Kelly's claim without question. Classic works by E. A. Brininstool, David Humphries Miller and Mari Sandoze have firmly established Private Gentles' name in the literature as the soldier responsible. John Carroll, in his introduction to Richard Hardorff's book on the genealogy of Crazy Horse, provided a brief biography of this soldier and he was even made the list of significant people in the west in Dan Thrapp's three volume Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography. This general acceptance in the literature prompted one recent writer to erroneously conclude that "numerous accounts place William Gentles at the guardhouse."
In 1996, historian Ephriam Dickson challenged the identification of Private Gentles as the soldier responsible, based on two lines of evidence. First, he noted that shortly after Sergeant Kelly's account was published, researcher Walter Camp sent copies to a number of individuals who had been present that evening to verify the information. Three different respondents specifically refuted Sergeant Kelly's identification of Private Gentles as the soldier who bayonetted Crazy Horse. Second, Dickson noted that no soldier named William F. Kelly is documented as serving in the Fourteenth Infantry or was present at Camp Robinson in 1877. Walter Camp attempted to track down Sergeant Kelly but without success. Dickson concluded that while witnesses agreed Crazy Horse was bayoneted by an enlisted soldier on guard duty outside the guardhouse, the identity of the soldier responsible remains unclear.
Death.
Company F 14th Infantry departed Camp Robinson on November 4, 1877, however, Private William Gentles remained behind, perhaps packing the company baggage. On November 10, he was issued two blankets by the quartermaster department and a short time later, "relieved from duty" at the post. He soon joined his company back at Camp Douglas, Utah.
In May 1878 suffering from asthma, Private Gentles was admitted to the post hospital at Camp Douglas. He died there on May 20, 1878 and was buried several days later in the post cemetery.

Paederia foetida

Paederia foetida is a species of plant, with common names that are variations of Skunkvine; Stinkvine; or Chinese Fever Vine. It is native to temperate, and tropical Asia; and has become naturalized in the Mascarenes, Melanesia, Polynesia, and the Hawaiian Islands, also found in North America by recent studies.
"Paederia foetida" is known for the strong, sulphurous odour exuded when its leaves or stems are crushed or bruised. This is because the oil responsible for the smell, and found primarily within the leaves, contains sulphur compounds, including largely dimethyl disulphide.
Distribution.
"P. foetida" is native to Bangladesh and southern Bhutan; Cambodia; Taiwan and China (in Hong Kong and Macau, and the provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan, Zhejiang); India (in Andhra Pradesh, Warangal, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, in the northern part of West Bengal, and the Andaman and Nicobar islands); Indonesia; Japan (in Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku prefectures, as well as in the Ryukyu Islands); Laos; Malaysia; Myanmar; Nepal; the Philippines; Singapore; South Korea; Thailand; and Vietnam.
Uses.
It is sometimes planted as an ornamental; and has virtue in folk medicine.
In Assamese it is called Bhedai lota or Paduri lota and is a distinct part of Assamese cuisine.
In Bengali it is called Gandhabhadule/Gandhabhatila/Gandal গন্ধভাদুলে/গন্ধভাতিলা/গাঁদাল and believed to be a laxative or bowel-function regulator.

Playing Columbine

Playing Columbine is a 2008 American documentary film produced and edited by Danny Ledonne, an American independent filmmaker. The film follows the video game "Super Columbine Massacre RPG!" in which players experience the Columbine High School massacre through the eyes of the killers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
Film content.
In the documentary, critics and supporters of the game are interviewed, including Ledonne, Jack Thompson, Hal Halpin, Doug Lowenstein, Jason Della Rocca, Jenova Chen, Ian Bogost, Tracy Fullerton, Brian Flemming, and the hosts of Free Talk Live. Arguments are made to support the game's inclusion in a growing movement of videogames with social agendas, referencing other independent games such as McDonald's Videogame, Darfur is Dying, , and those made by Persuasive Games.
Supporters of video games such as Greg Costikyan note that the medium of the video game is undergoing the same reactionary criticism as previously experienced by comic books, rock and roll, and Dungeons and Dragons. Some argue that video games will gain more mainstream acceptance as more video game players are in positions of power. The film argues that the medium of the video game should no longer be viewed as a child's toy but rather as a mature form of art (see art game).
The film also examines the link drawn by the "Toronto Sun" and other media outlets between the Columbine videogame and the 2006 Dawson College shooting. The shooter, Kimveer Gill allegedly listed Super Columbine Massacre RPG! as his favorite game. Two students at Dawson College during the shooting, Melissa Fuller and Joel Kornek, are interviewed and both dismiss the game's role in the shooting. However, Jack Thompson maintains that the game is a "murder simulator" that "trained" the shooter. The link between the game and the shooting is regarded as an "easy out for society" by then IGDA executive director Jason Della Rocca.
The final section of the film documents the 2007 controversy at the Slamdance Film Festival in which the Columbine videogame was pulled from the Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition by festival director Peter Baxter. In response, University of Southern California pulled its sponsorship of the competition and half of the other game developers pulled their projects out of the festival. The Slamdance documentary jury attempted to award the game a special jury prize but Baxter prevented the award from being given. Eventually, the game screened at other events such as Living Game Worlds in Gijon, Spain and a gallery installation at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.
Slamdance Festival rejection.
The film was rejected from the 2008 Slamdance Film Festival - which the film notes during the end credits. Ian Bogost at Water Cooler Games observed that "It's certainly no surprise that those 'subjective decisions' would include the rejection of the film, which is openly critical of the festival."
Release.
Playing Columbine premiered at AFI Fest in Los Angeles, California on November 7, 2008.
It has also screened at Artfutura, the Bradford Animation Festival, the Denver Film Festival, and the Santa Fe Film Festival.
It has been screened in academic venues such as University of Texas at Dallas, Emerson College and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
The film has been released online via Amazon Instant Video, iTunes, and Netflix.
Reception.
Reacting to the trailer for the film released in July 2007, Brian Crecente wrote at the gaming site Kotaku that, "Judging by the rather short trailer, it feels like the documentary is a little too much about Ledonne and not enough about the very real and complicated issues involving both the shooting and the idea of tacking serious subject matters with video games." 
A first look screening of the film at Gamecity in October 2007 prompted Daniel Etherington to write on BBC Collective, "fascinating documentary... Isn’t it time that games were taken seriously?" 
He continued:

Gresham (Edgewater, Maryland)

Gresham is a historic home near Edgewater, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It is a large -story frame dwelling built by John Gresham II after 1686 on land owned by land-grant pioneer Captain Edward Selby. 
After the Selby heirs suffered financial setbacks, the plantation was owned briefly by the pirate William Cotter and then by assorted members of Colonel Nicholas Gassaway's family (his daughter Jane having married Cotter), including the sons of Captain John Gassaway, Lord High Sheriff of Annapolis. The Gresham family continued to own the house on rented Gassaway land then known as Cotter's Desire. Gresham is most associated with Commodore Isaac Mayo, who received it from his uncle who had purchased the property and house from the Cotter/Gassaway heirs around 1765. He occupied the property beginning in the early 19th century until his controversial death there in 1861 at the dawn of the Civil war he openly opposed.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

Mehmet Cavit Bey

Mehmet Cavit Bey, Mehmed Cavid Bey or Mehmed Djavid Bey (1875–1926) was an Ottoman Sabbatean economist, newspaper editor and leading politician during the last period of the Ottoman Empire. A member of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), he was part of the Young Turks and had positions in government after the constitution was established. In the beginning of the Republican period, he was executed for alleged involvement in an assassination attempt against Mustafa Kemal.
Early years and career.
Cavit was born in Salonica (Thessaloniki), then in the Ottoman Empire. His father was Naim, a merchant, and his mother was Pakize; they were cousins.
Cavit was educated in economics in Constantinople (Istanbul). Following his graduation, he worked as a bank clerk and later as a teacher. 
Later he became an economist and newspaper editor. Having returned to Salonica, Cavit Bey joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). After the proclamation of the Second Constitution in 1908, he was elected deputy of Salonica and Kale-i Sultaniye (Çanakkale) into the parliament in Constantinople. Following the 31 March Incident in 1909, Cavit Bey was appointed minister of finance in the cabinet of Grand Vizier Tevfik Pasha.
Until the Armistice of Mudros in 1918 following the World War I, Cavit Bey played an important role in the CUP. Cavit Bey represented the Ottoman Empire in postwar financial negotiations in London and Berlin.
Republican period.
In 1921, Mehmet Cavit Bey married Aliye Nazlı, the divorced wife of a prince. In 1924, heir son Osman Şiar was born. After Cavit Bey's execution, his son was raised by his close friend Hüseyin Cahit Yalçın. Following the enactment of the surname law in 1934, Osman Şiar adopted the surname Yalçın.
In the early period of the Republican era, Mehmet Cavit Bey was charged with involvement in the assassination attempt in Izmir against Mustafa Kemal Pasha. After a widespread government investigation, Cavit Bey was convicted and later executed by hanging on August 26, 1926 in Ankara. Thirteen others, including other CUP members Ahmed Şükrü and Ismail Canbulat, were found guilty of treason and hanged. 
The letters which Cavit Bey wrote to his wife Aliye Nazlı during his imprisonment were given to her only after his execution. She had the letters published later as a book entitled, "Zindandan Mektuplar" ("Letters from the Dungeon").
In 1950, Cavit Bey's remains were transferred and reinterred at the Cebeci Asri Cemetery in Ankara.

Blackbriar Thorn

Blackbriar Thorn is a DC Comics supervillain. Created by Len Wein and Joe Kubert, the character first appeared in "DC Comics Presents" # 66 (Feb 1984).
Fictional character biography.
Origins.
Blackbriar Thorn was a High Priest of the ancient Druids of Cymru. While his entire sect is massacred by attacking Roman forces, Thorn absconds to the surrounding forest. Attempting to escape capture, he transforms himself into solid wood, hiding amongst the trees. Unfortunately for Thorn, the agony of his dying comrades creates a geological upheaval which buries his newly arboreal form underground. 
Millennia later, Blackbriar Thorn's body is unearthed by an archaeologist and subsequently displayed at The Gotham City Museum of History. When moonlight strikes the statue on the night of its unveiling, Thorn is revived and begins to wreak havoc upon the Museum and its patrons, counted among whom are alter egos of Superman and Etrigan the Demon. The mismatched heroic pair's actions drive Thorn to retreat into the city, where he later rampages in a plot to procure a new body—that of Superman. Together, Etrigan and Superman defeat Thorn, ostensibly rendering him incorporeal.
"Crisis on Infinite Earths".
Blackbriar Thorn appears, seemingly in human form, during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. He, Etrigan, and other assembled mystics lend their combined energies—channeled through Doctor Occult and Green Lantern Alan Scott—to successfully defeat the Anti-Monitor's Shadow Demons, which had been ravaging the Earth.
Post-Crisis.
Ostensibly disembodied once more and said to have lingered in Gotham Park since his prior defeat, Thorn is later channeled by a stage psychic at the behest of John Constantine to provide information about pending calamity in The Green. 
Blackbriar Thorn next appears (again, with a human appearance) as an agent of the demon Neron in a demonic realm called The Abyss. Holding captive the soul of Mollie Scott as bait, Thorn attempts to ensnare her husband, Alan Scott, but, in defeat, is surprised to find Alan no longer vulnerable to wood. 
As part of Johnny Sorrow's version of the Injustice Society, a more woody-looking Thorn and his teammates are defeated by Wildcat as they invade the JSA's Headquarters. Thorn's defeat left his body splintered, one shard of which is kept on display in JSA Headquarters. Though able to regenerate, Thorn lies dormant until the Injustice Society's next attack. Using a crossbow, Injustice Society comrade Tigress shoots the splintered sliver of Blackbriar Thorn into Alan Scott's chest. Apparently once more susceptible to wood, Scott is gravely wounded as Thorn regenerates from the embedded projectile and proceeds to inflict more damage. Thorn is ultimately defeated in this siege on the JSA by Stargirl.
Blackbriar Thorn appears most recently in Day of Vengeance battling the Spectre, who, influenced by Eclipso, attempts to kill all magic wielders in the DC Universe. The combatants appear in gigantic form greatly dwarfing onlookers. Thorn loses the battle, but delays his next regeneration in order to lend his powers, along with many other mystics, in a combined effort to defeat the rampaging Spectre.
Blackbriar Thorn was among the villains in the ambush of the JSA led by Tapeworm.
The New 52.
In "The New 52" (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Blackbriar Thorn is one of two powerful magical entities used by Nick Necro to combat the Justice League Dark. He briefly tries to destroy Zatanna in Slaughter Swamp near Gotham, controlling an entire forest with his magic. He is then possessed by Deadman and neutralized.
During the "Forever Evil" storyline (namely ""), Blackbriar Thorn is among the magic users in the possession of Felix Faust and Nick Necro where they planned to use the magic users as part of a weapon to defeat the creature that destroyed the Crime Syndicate's Earth.
Powers and abilities.
Blackbriar Thorn has exhibited a plethora of abilities, including manipulation of the weather, extensive control over vegetation—either living or dead, the ability to regenerate from even a sliver of his physical form, creation of illusions. Thorns abilities are terran-based and, as seen in his debut, he can draw extensive strength and abilities though physical contact with the Earth itself. Inside buildings, he still retains the ability to control surrounding plant life, animating it to his will and frequently increasing its volume and strength. Thorn's organic manipulation of his own woody form, including the projection of tendrils and vines, appears to be uninhibited when separated from terra firma as well.

Holly Hill (Friendship, Maryland)

Holly Hill, also known as Holland's Hills or Rose Valley, is a historic home at Friendship, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. It was originally a primitive, two-room, -story frame dwelling constructed in the fall or winter of 1698. An addition was made in 1713, and about 1730 the entire structure was encased in brick and another addition was constructed. The house is an example of the Medieval Transitional style of architecture. It was a quarter plantation of Richard Harrison, who likely built the original structure for his son, Samuel Harrison (1679–1733).
Ownership of Holly Hill continued in the Harrison family until 1850; then, after a brief interregnum, it was the home of a branch of the Scrivener family until its purchase in the late 1930s by Captain and Mrs. Hugh P. LeClair. The LeClair family performed an extensive restoration of the house and added a kitchen wing and a detached garage in faithful Tidewater style. In 1968 Holly Hill was purchased by Brice McAdoo Clagett (1933–2008), a descendant of Richard Harrison. Mr. Clagett and his first wife, Virginia P. Clagett, added extensive ornamental plantings and gardens to the grounds near the house.
Holly Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Holly Hill is protected by conservation easements that are held by Maryland Environmental Trust and Maryland Historical Trust.

Bayan Knights

Bayan Knights is a fictional superhero team from the Philippines. Conceptualized by a group of comic book creators from different parts of the country (and some based overseas) as a collaboration to revitalize the local Comics industry. As per the message posted in their official blog:
"Sacred Mountain Publications has gathered in this issue more than a dozen upbeat and talented creators along with their independent studios in one gigantic effort to encourage friendly cooperation and make it possible for these artists to turn their imaginations into reality."
Bayan Knights is considered a benchmark in Philippine comics history as the first title to feature the characters of individual creators while retaining the individual rights to them. An article in the Philippine Daily Inquirer Sunday edition printed on November 26, 2008 was the first to provide media recognition to the project. A second major article was published months after the comics' debut and was reviewed in the February 2009 issue of FHM Philippines.
Bayan Knights was officially created and launched on September 2008 through their Deviantart page and their [http://bayanknights.blogspot.com|official blog. A teaser trailer was also posted at YouTube[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqZ0VXs4Fo0|YouTube]. The Issue #1 premiered during the Komikon 2008 held at the "UP Bahay ng Alumni" on November 22, 2008.
Fictional team history.
After a bloody encounter with powerful underworld forces that left his elite team virtually wiped out, Sarhento Sagrado confiscates the highly advanced facility that they raided. Worried about the safety of his family and determined to bring the masterminds to justice, Sagrado fakes his own death and destroys all traces of the existence of the facility, vowing to use the very resources his nemeses accumulated in the cause of their downfall.
Through the database compiled in the facility, Sagrado determined that the so-called superheroes were key figures in the grand scheme. Needing allies in his 'war' against the underworld, Sagrado sought out and recruited them one by one. Although successful with the 'street-level' heroes, he found it increasingly difficult to locate, let alone convince, the virtual demigods.
Enter the enigmatic Council. Effortlessly bypassing the security protocols of the facility, Council confronted and offered his assistance to Sagrado. Although claiming not to be "one of them", Council convinces Sagrado to allow him to recruit "the ones he needed".
As the days progressed, Sagrado intercepts information on a vital part of the masterminds' schemes. Still waiting on the response from Council, Sagrado assembles his 'Core' Team to investigate. Once there, they find stasis containment units. Opening one of the units reveals it contained an unidentified female. Before they could determine the vile purpose of the stasis units, they are ambushed by Sipaka, preternatural watchdogs who are sworn enemies of one of their own, Salakay. Managing to fight their way out, they are shocked to discover several hundred more Sipaka awaiting them.
As things turn bleak for the heroes, Sagrado attempts one final time to contact Council. The latter responds, moments before the Powerhouse Team, composed of the most powerful superheroes on earth, descends from the heavens.
In issue #2 the army of Sipakas are easily beaten back by the combined Core/Powerhouse teams. But no sooner as one battle ends the 2 teams become embroiled in separate adventures. Meanwhile, another team is assembled, the Gilas Team to deal with the assault of demonic entities in the metropolis. Behind all this, another mysterious group makes its moves against the growing Bayan Knights membership. At the end of the issue, Sagrado is confronted with the daunting task of unifying the disparate superheroes into a cohesive force. However, his planning is disrupted by the awakening and rampage of the rescued Liberty Girl.
In issue #3 the berserk Liberty Girl causes catastrophic destruction in the Facility with a number of heroes falling to her unbridled fury. Phantom Cat and Luzviminda manage to fight her to a standstill until the young god Servant ends the confrontation. Elsewhere, Maskarado and Kalayaan are ambushed as theBangis(a conglomerate of super-villains in direct opposition to the Bayan Knights)make their presence known led by a super powerful enslaved superhero Maso.
In issue #4 the Core Team along with a number of Lagalag team up to counter the attack of the Bangis and manage to free the enslaved hero Maso. As Council continues to make his own moves (recruiting members of the TronIX team) the Gilas team assaults the gates of Hell on a mission to locate the entity Gabriel Black.
In issue #5, even as the heroes of the Gilas and Halaw Teams succeed in their missions, and members of the Powerhouse Division foil an invasion of The Facility, the plans of the Bangis fall into place, planting a traitor among the heroes' ranks who successfully breaks out the captured villains and assault The Facility.
The story is ongoing.
Membership.
Bayan Knights is unique in its organization as it has designated "divisions" but is flexible enough that members can be swapped out depending on the mission specifics.
CORE.
[[File:BK Core.JPG|left|thumb|150px|"Core Team" From the cover of Bayan Knights#1.
Clockwise(from top left): "Manila Man", "Sarhento Sagrado", "Phantom Cat", "Boy Ipis", "Salakay", "Bato, Agimat Warrior". Art by Gilbert Monsanto and Edgar Tadeo.]]
The 'Core' Team effectively serves as the reconnaissance and primary investigative unit. Ideally, the team avoids direct aggression, relying more on stealth and subterfuge but has enough brute force to handle most conflicts.
POWERHOUSE.
[[File:BKPowerhouse.JPG|Left|thumb|200px|"Powerhouse Team" From the cover of "Bayan Knights" #1.
Bottom Row (from left): "Kalayaan", "Claw", "Council". Art by Gilbert Monsanto and Edgar Tadeo.]]
As the name implies, this team comprises the upper echelon of superheroes in terms of raw power in the Bayan Knights shared universe, literal "gods amongst men".
GILAS.
Composed of heroes with a more "hard core" attitude than the rest of the roster, the Gilas crew are also characterized by the supernatural elements that their members share.
HALAW.
Whereas Gilas' supernatural elements are dark and gothic in nature, the Halaw team members' origins are based on folklore and fantasy.
TRONIX.
Actually pronounced as "TRON 9", this team is composed of heroes whose origins and powers are based on advanced technology.
NURSERY.
The Nursery is a division of Bayan Knights that was formed to recruit and train young and inexperienced heroes.
LAGALAG.
"Lagalag" is not actually a division but rather a designation for heroes who are not actual members of Bayan Knights in an official capacity but have dedicated their service should the need arise.

Hancock's Resolution is a historic two-storey gambrel-roofed stone farm house with shed-roofed dormers and interior end chimneys located on a 15-acre (6.1 ha) farm at 2795 Bayside Beach Road in Pasadena, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. In 1785 Stephen Hancock, Jr. built the original stone section as the main house for what was then a 410-acre (170 ha) farm. Additions to the house were built in 1855 and in about 1900. Stone and frame outbuildings remain, including a one-storey gable-roofed stone dairy. Hancock's Resolution remained in Hancock family ownership until the deaths in the 1960s of Mary Hancock and her brother, Henry Hancock, who left the property to Anne Arundel County to be preserved. Hancock's Resolution underwent a thorough restoration in 2000 and is now open to the public as a house museum.
On October 10, 1975, Hancock's Resolution was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Included in the designation were the additions, outbuildings and the Hancock family graveyard.

<doc id="20426260" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20426260" title="ANG1005">
ANG1005

ANG1005 is a promising chemotherapy drug that was developed by a biotechnology company located in Montreal, Canada known as Angiochem Inc. This drug is inserted intravenously and is currently in early clinical stages of development and dose escalation. However, ANG1005 consists of a 19 amino acid long peptide vector known as Angiopep that is conjugated to a taxane derivative involved in mitotic inhibition known as paclitaxel. Various Angiopep vectors have been composed but solely differ by their anti-cancer moieties. This has then been shown to be a prospective cancer therapy drug that can not only be conjugated to paclitaxel but also peptides, monoclonal antibodies, siRNA and many other biological aspects. ANG1005 will then possess the potential to treat a variety of CNS diseases including glioma. Research has shown reduction in tumour growth in mice and rats with glioblastoma tumors.
Use.
This drug was specifically designed to treat brain tumors that consist of a unique feature known as the blood brain barrier (BBB) that prevents many developed cancer therapy drugs to pass through the brain capillaries and into the parenchyma. Paclitaxel is generally prevented from reaching its target in the cell due to the presence of the efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the blood barrier. This is known as a multidrug resistant-associated protein (MRP1) that causes resistance amongst many organic drugs that are not conjugated to acidic ligands. This receptor is an ATP - driven transporter that will pump drugs, drug metabolites, and endogenous metabolites out of the cell.
Mechanism of action.
ANG1005 contains paclitaxel which stabilizes microtubule polymer formation. Microtubules are composed of polymers consisting of the protein tubulin. Therefore, paclitaxel will bind at the site of β-tubulin and induce polymerization thus protecting the microtubule from disassembling in mitosis. This will block the progression of mitosis due to a prolonged activation of the microtubule in the mitotic checkpoint, resulting in cell apoptosis or reversion to the G0 phase. However, ANG1005 will effectively transport across the BBB with approximately a 100 fold higher transport rate compared to a free paclitaxel.
ANG1005 will cross the capillary medium via receptor mediated transcytosis of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) which is upregulated in some cancers. Ester hydrolyzing enzymes (esterases) will then catalyze a highly stereospecific reaction, resulting in hydrolysis of the ANG1005 ester to carboxylic acids. This will result in the intracellular release of paclitaxel and subsequent action on tubulin.
Concentration has been found to play a key role ANG1005’s administration. Studies show that a high concentration will suppress microtubule detachment which is necessary for mitosis to occur. The microenvironment of cells may also differ from that of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. This is generally more oxygen deficient and acidic. These conditions will then result in a selective pressure towards cancer cell proliferation. It has been shown that cancer cell lines exposed to this hypoxic or serum-deprived condition will upregulate LPR1 expression, thus leading to an increased uptake of ANG1005. However, these receptors are also present in non-cancerous cells, thus presenting a challenge due to non-specific targeting. It is then believed that because these receptors are overexposed in tumors, that receptor binding may be in favor of the cancer cells.
Clinical trials.
In 2008, two Phase-I clinical trials of ANG1005 were started ; one in patients with advanced cancer and brain metastases, and another in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Favourable initial tolerability results in brain cancer were reported in March 2009. and more in October 2009 and updated in June 2010.

Cassin was one of the leading mountaineers of the inter-war period; in all, Cassin made a total of 2,500 ascents, of which over 100 first ascents. In 1940 he married Irma, with whom he had three sons – Valentino, Pierantonio and Guido.
Alpinism.
Cassin started mountaineering around 1930 together with a group known as the "Ragni di Lecco" (spiders of Lecco). In 1934, he made the first ascent of the Piccolissima of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo. In 1935, after having repeated Emilio Comici's route on the north-west face of the Civetta, he climbed the south-eastern ridge of the Trieste Tower and, with Vittorio Ratti, made a new route of the north face of Cima Ovest di Lavaredo. In 1937, Cassin made his first climb on the granite of the Western Alps. Over the course of three days, 14–16 July, he made the first ascent of the north-east face of Piz Badile in the Val Bregaglia (Bergell), Switzerland, accompanied by Ratti, Gino Esposito, M. Molteni and G. Valsecchi, the latter two of whom died of exhaustion and exposure on the descent. This route is known today as the Cassin Route or the "Via Cassin". He would confirm his extraordinary skills climbing again this route, 50 years later, when aged 78.
Perhaps his most celebrated first ascent was of the Walker Spur on the north face of the Grandes Jorasses in the Mont Blanc massif on 4–6 August 1938 with Esposito and Ugo Tizzoni. The alpine historian Helmut Dumler comments that this was "by then universally acknowledged as the finest alpine challenge." According to Claire Engel:
In 1939, together with Tizzoni, Cassin made the first ascent of a steep line on the north face of the Aiguille de Leschaux.
World War II.
During World War II Cassin fought on the side of the partisans against the German occupiers. On 26 April 1945, when he was chief partisan, both he and Ratti (who had accompanied him on several first ascents) attempted to stop a group of German soldiers from escaping to the Valtellina and St Moritz, and Ratti was shot dead. Cassin was decorated for his actions in the partisan campaign during the years 1943–45.
Expedition leader.
Cassin was supposed to have been on the Italian expedition that made the first ascent of K2 in the Karakoram in 1954, but Ardito Desio, the chief expedition leader for the Italian Alpine Club, preferred to leave Cassin home. According to Cassin himself:
Following this experience, Cassin concentrated on organizing and leading expeditions, including the first ascent of Gasherbrum IV in the Karakoram by Walter Bonatti and Carlo Mauri on 6 August 1958 and an expedition that climbed Jirishanca in the Andes in 1960.
In 1961, Cassin was both leader and a successful ascentionist on the expedition that made the first ascent of the eponymous "Cassin Ridge" on Mount McKinley in Alaska, at that date the most technical route on the mountain. After this ascent President Kennedy sent Cassin a telegram of congratulation, and had the Bay of Pigs crisis not intervened, he was scheduled to meet Cassin. In 1975, Cassin led an expedition to the unclimbed south face of Lhotse in the Himalaya, but this was unsuccessful as a result of bad weather.
Mountaineering equipment.
Cassin began designing and producing mountaineering equipment in Lecco in 1947. That year he produced his first rock pitons; in 1948 he produced his first hammers, his first ice axes appeared in 1949, and 1950 saw the introduction of his karabiners. That same year he produced the "first eiderdown duvet jackets for non-European mountaineering expeditions", these going into production two years later. In 1958 he and his son produced their first harness prototype; this went into production two years later, the same year that he introduced titanium crampons.
In 1967 the company became a Limited Company and in the early 1980s it moved from Lecco to Valmadrera. In 1997 the CAMP company bought the Cassin trademark.
100th birthday celebrations.
Cassin's 100th birthday was on 2 January 2009. A book, entitled "Riccardo Cassin: Cento volti di un grande alpinista" ("Riccardo Cassin: One Hundred Faces of a Great Alpinist"), was produced to mark the occasion, containing one hundred testimonies from people connected with Cassin, including Edouard Frendo, Georges Livanos, John F. Kennedy, Reinhold Messner, Carlo Mauri, Walter Bonatti, Gianni Brera and Candido Cannavò.
He died in Piano dei Resinelli, Lecco, on 6 August 2009, aged 100.

Extriplex californica

Extriplex californica is a plant species known by the common name California saltbush or California orache. Formerly, it was included in genus "Atriplex". It is native to coastal California and Baja California, where it grows in areas with saline soils, such as beaches and salt marshes.
Description.
"Extriplex californica" is a perennial herb growing from a fleshy caudex and taproot. Many stems spread to a maximum width of about 80 centimeters and 30 centimeters in height. The scaly gray-green leaves are lance-shaped to oval and less than 3 centimeters long. 
The plant may be monoecious or dioecious, with some plants having both male and female flower types, and others having just one. Both types of inflorescence are rough clusters of tiny flowers.
Systematics.
The first publication of this taxon was in 1849 by Alfred Moquin-Tandon (in: De Candolle: "Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis" 13(2): 98) as "Atriplex californica" Moq. In 2010, after phylogenetic research, Elizabeth H. Zacharias classified it in a new genus "Extriplex", as "Extriplex california" (Moq.) E.H.Zacharias. 
"Extriplex californica" belongs to the tribe Atripliceae in the Chenopodioideae subfamily of Amaranthaceae.

Through the Eye of the Needle

Through the Eye of the Needle: A Romance is a 1907 Utopian novel written by William Dean Howells. It is the final volume in Howells's "Altrurian trilogy," following "A Traveler from Altruria" (1894) and "Letters of an Altrurian Traveler" (1904).
Like the second book in the trilogy, Howells casts the third and final book in the form of an epistolary novel — a form favored by some other Utopian and dystopian writers. (For examples, see: "The Republic of the Future"; "Caesar's Column".) In the final book, Aristides Homos, Howells's Altrurian protagonist, writes a series of letters home to his friend Cyril. Homos is now located in the densely urban environment of New York City, where he confronts the contrasts between America c. 1900 and his own pastoral and agrarian Utopianism in their most extreme forms. 
The dramatic center of the book is the love affair between Homos and Evelith Strange, a wealthy widow of the American plutocracy. Evelith has chosen the life of a socialite because she is frustrated by the limited effects of "good works" — though her routine of idleness conflicts with her Christian values and her conscience. Evelith must decide whether to abandon her social position and her fortune to follow Homos back to Altruria. Eventually, Evelith marries Homos, and both she and her mother return with him to Altruria. Curiously, the mother-in-law finds the adjustment relatively easy, since she realizes that she has returned to the simpler life she knew in her youth.
Howells gives the moral writings of Leo Tolstoy an important role in the book — though not with naive acceptance. At one point, Evelith tells Homos that "Tolstoy himself doesn't destroy his money, though he wants other people to do it. His wife keeps it and supports the family."
The story also includes Homos's travels abroad, and his commentaries on the societies he visits.

Black-and-white dualism

The hues white and black are widely used to depict opposites. Visually, white and black offer a high contrast. In Western culture, white and black traditionally symbolize the dichotomy of good and evil, metaphorically related to light and darkness and day and night.
The dichotomy of light and darkness appears already in the Pythagorean "Table of Opposites".
The topos of "light and darkness" is also reflected in numerous titles in popular culture, such as "Heart of Darkness" (1899), "Light in My Darkness" (1927), "Darkness and the Light" (1942), "Creatures of Light and Darkness" (1969), "From Darkness to Light" (1973), "Darkness and Light" (1989), "The Lord of the Light and of the Darkness" (1993), the "" episode "" (1997), the "Babylon 5" episode "Between the Darkness and the Light" (1997), and "Out of the Darkness, Into the Light" (1998).
George Orwell makes a bitterly ironic use of the "light and darkness" topos in his "Nineteen Eighty Four". In the early part of the book the protagonist is getting a promise that "We will meet in the place where there is no darkness" - which he interprets as referring to a place where the oppressive totalitarian state does not rule. But the man who made the promise was in fact an agent of the Thought Police - and they eventually meet as prisoner and interrogator where there is indeed no darkness, in detention cells where the light remains on permanently, day and night, as an additional means of torturing detainees. 
Relation to Racism.
Some people argue that using "black" for depicting negative things and "white" for positive things is racist language.

Tumtum and Nutmeg is the first of a series of children's books by author Emily Bearn. The book is about Mr and Mrs Nutmouse (the eponymous Tumtum and Nutmeg) who live in Nutmouse Hall, situated within the broom cupboard of Rose Cottage. It was first published in January 2008. The other books in the series include "The Great Escape", "The Pirates' Treasure", "A Christmas Adventure", "A Seaside Adventure", "A Circus Adventure" and "Trouble at Rose Cottage".
Tumtum and Nutmeg.
Mr and Mrs Nutmouse (respectively: Tumtum and Nutmeg) live in Nutmouse Hall a grand house (for mice) secreted within the broom closet of Rose Cottage. Rose Cottage is the home of a human family: Mr Walter Mildew and his children, Arthur and Lucy. Mr Mildew is an inventor and is struggling to maintain the family while he develops his latest invention, a mechanical mouse that cleans. Due to their father's absent-mindedness and financial situation, Rose Cottage is in poor repair and Arthur and Lucy wear threadbare clothes and are frequently hungry.
Nutmeg begins, with Tumtum's help, to help take care of the children. Using the cover of "Nutmeg, a Fairy of Sorts", Nutmeg cleans the attic in which the children sleep and mends their clothes while Tumtum makes repairs to both the room and the children's toys. The children repay Nutmeg's kindness by leaving treats for them in the doll's house.
Things change when Aunt Ivy comes to stay while her home in Scotland is being fumigated for mice (which she hates). After a chance sighting of Tumtum and Nutmeg, Ivy poisons Tumtum (though not fatally) and makes plans to gas Nutmouse Hall. In desperation Nutmeg enlists the help of General Marchmouse, a recently retired member of the mouse army. Marchmouse, with much unacknowledged help from Nutmeg, formulates a plan to drive Ivy from the house via a massed charge of the village mice.

Tobacco smoke enema

The tobacco smoke enema, an insufflation of tobacco smoke into the rectum by enema, was a medical treatment employed by European physicians for a range of ailments.
Tobacco was recognised as a medicine soon after it was first imported from the New World, and tobacco smoke was used by western medical practitioners as a tool against cold and drowsiness, but applying it by enema was a technique appropriated from the North American Indians. The procedure was used to treat gut pain, and attempts were often made to resuscitate victims of near drowning. Liquid tobacco enemas were often given to ease the symptoms of a hernia.
During the early 19th century the practice fell into decline, when it was discovered that the principal active agent in tobacco smoke, nicotine, is poisonous.
Tobacco in medicine.
Until its discovery and importation from the New World, tobacco was unknown to western medicine. Europeans were not ignorant of the effects of smoke; incense has been used since antiquity, and the narcotic effects of burning hemp seed was well known by the Scythians and Thracians. The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates recommended the inhalation of smoke for "female diseases" as did Pliny the Elder, as a cure for coughs. The Native Americans from whom the first western explorers learnt about tobacco used the leaf for a variety of purposes, including religious worship, but Europeans soon became aware that the Americans also used tobacco for medicinal purposes. The French diplomat Jean Nicot used a tobacco poultice as an analgesic, and Nicolás Monardes advocated tobacco as a treatment for a long list of diseases, such as cancer, headaches, respiratory problems, stomach cramps, gout, intestinal worms and female diseases. Contemporaneous medical science placed much weight on humorism, and for a short period tobacco became a panacea. Its use was mentioned in pharmacopoeia as a tool against cold and somnolence brought on by particular medical afflictions, its effectiveness explained by its ability to soak up moisture, to warm parts of the body, and to therefore maintain the equilibrium so important to a healthy person. In an attempt to discourage disease tobacco was also used to fumigate buildings.
The stimulation of respiration through the introduction of tobacco smoke by a rectal tube was first practiced by the North American Indians. An early example of the use of this procedure was described in 1809 by Thomas Sydenham, who to cure iliac passion prescribed first bleeding, followed by a tobacco smoke enema:
Tobacco smoke enemas were also reportedly used by 19th-century Danish farmers, for horses that needed laxatives, and the US anthropologist Frank Speck reported that contemporary Catawba Native Americans also treated their horses using the technique.
Medical opinion.
To physicians of the time, the appropriate treatment for "apparent death" was warmth and stimulation. Anne Greene, a woman sentenced to death and hanged in 1650 for the supposed murder of her stillborn child, was found by anatomists to be still alive. They revived her by pouring hot cordial down her throat, rubbing her limbs and extremities, bleeding her, applying heating plasters and a "heating odoriferous Clyster to be cast up in her body, to give heat and warmth to her bowels." After placing her in a warm bed with another woman, to keep her warm, she recovered fully and was pardoned. Artificial respiration and the blowing of smoke into the lungs or the rectum were thought to be interchangeably useful, however, the smoke enema was considered the most potent method, due to its supposed warming and stimulating properties. The Dutch experimented with methods of inflating the lungs, as a treatment for those who had fallen into their canals and apparently drowned. Patients were also given rectal infusions of tobacco smoke, as a respiratory stimulant. Richard Mead was among the first Western scholars to recommend tobacco smoke enemas to resuscitate victims of drowning, when in 1745 he recommended tobacco glysters to treat iatrogenic drowning caused by immersion therapy. His name was cited in one of the earliest documented cases of resuscitation by rectally applied tobacco smoke, from 1746, when a seemingly drowned woman was treated. On the advice of a passing sailor, the woman's husband inserted the stem of the sailor's pipe into her rectum, covered the bowl with a piece of perforated paper, and "blew hard". The woman was apparently revived. In the 1780s the Royal Humane Society installed resuscitation kits, including smoke enemas, at various points along the River Thames, and by the turn of the 19th century, tobacco smoke enemas had become an established practice in Western medicine, considered by Humane Societies to be as important as artificial respiration.
By 1805, the use of rectally applied tobacco smoke was so established as a way to treat obstinate constrictions of the alimentary canal that doctors began experimenting with other delivery mechanisms. In one experiment, a decoction of half a drachm of tobacco in four ounces of water was used as an enema in a patient suffering from general convulsion where there was no expected recovery. The decoction worked as a powerful agent to penetrate and "roused the sensibility" of the patient to end the convulsions, although the decoction resulted in excited sickness, vomiting, and profuse perspiration. Such enemas were often used to treat hernias. A middle-aged man was reported in 1843 to have died following an application, performed to treat a strangulated hernia, and in a similar case in 1847 a woman was given a liquid tobacco enema, supplemented with a chicken broth enema, and pills of opium and calomel (taken orally). The woman later recovered.
In 1811, a medical writer noted that "he powers of the Tobacco Enema are so remarkable, that they have arrested the attention of practitioners in a remarkable manner. Of the effects and the method of exhibiting the smoke of Tobacco "per anum", much has been written", providing a list of European publications on the subject. Smoke enemas were also used to treat various other afflictions. An 1827 report in a medical journal tells of a woman treated for constipation with repeated smoke enemas, with little apparent success. According to a report of 1835, tobacco enemas were used successfully to treat cholera "in the stage of collapse".
Decline.
Attacks on the theories surrounding the ability of tobacco to cure diseases had begun early in the 17th century. King James I was scathing of its effectiveness, writing " will not deigne to cure heere any other than cleanly and gentlemanly diseases." Others claimed that smoking dried out the humours, that snuff made the brain sooty, and that old people should not smoke as they were naturally dried up anyway.
While certain beliefs regarding the effectiveness of tobacco smoke to protect against disease persisted until well into the 20th century, the use of smoke enemas in Western medicine declined after 1811, when through animal experimentation Benjamin Brodie demonstrated that nicotine—the principal active agent in tobacco smoke—is a cardiac poison that can stop the circulation of blood.

It was made into a film in 1993 called "Say a Little Prayer", directed by Richard Lowenstein. It was given the designation of White Raven book at the 1990 Bologna Children's Book Fair.
Plot summary.
The novel begins with shy, eleven-year-old Seymour staying with Thelma, an acquaintance of his mother for the summer holidays. Seymour's parents have split and are arguing over custody of him. After a drunken threat by Seymour's father to take him away interstate, his mother has Seymour relocated to Thelma's house in Victoria Road. There Seymour is bored and lonely. During the day, while Thelma is at work, Seymour is not allowed to open the door, or leave the house, because of his mother's fear that his father might come and find him.
However one morning Seymour decides to climb over the back gate and walk to the nearby shops. He goes to a park where a group of children tease him. Not knowing how to defend himself, Seymour runs away and is chased. In desperation he goes through a random gate and meets a young girl: Angie. Angie is described as in her late teens, and as a beautiful angel. Seymour is drawn to Angie because she treats him with the affection and friendliness that he lacks from his parents. Angie takes him on outings to horse races, her mother's house, shops, and a restaurant. Over the course of the novel Seymour's faint suspicions about Angie develop, but he refuses to consider them.
One day Seymour finds Angie in her flat looking sick and acting "peculiar". He calls her sister Lynne. Lynne comes over and after looking at Angie with disdain, rings her father who drives up and takes Angie away. Lynne advises Seymour to keep away from Angie and that he is wasting his time. Nonetheless Seymour resolves to go to Angie's flat and clean it for when she comes home. He discovers that it has already been cleaned and almost everything is packed away. Lynne finds Seymour in the flat and tells him that Angie won't be coming back, and that Angie has been taking drugs for nearly five years. Angie is going to Rankin House, a rehabilitation center temporarily, then to Lakeview.
Seymour visits Angie to gives her the doll that that was left at the flat. After initially being hostile Angie pretends that she has been sick with Pleurisy and will be back soon. They begin to fight, but Seymour, weary of her lying, returns the doll and leaves.
Angie apologises to Seymour through a letter and writes about the rehab, and how when her baby is born they will go to live with her parents. In the postscript there is Seymour's reply. He describes Carrucan, where he and his mother have moved to, and that his father visited him and got a job as a truck driver. Seymour talks about how he has made a friend called Martin, is finally learning how to swim and that when Angie gets out of Lakeview they can go out to places together with her baby.

Excavations at the Temple Mount

A number of archaeological excavations at the Temple Mount — a celebrated and contentious religious site in the Old City of Jerusalem — have taken place over the last 150 years. The first were undertaken by the British Royal Engineers in the 1870s.
Since Israel took control of the Old City in 1967, archaeological excavations in the vicinity of the Mount have been undertaken by Israel and the Waqf. Both excavations have been controversial and criticized. Israeli excavations have also sparked demonstrations and objections in the Muslim world. Israeli and Jewish groups have criticized excavations conducted by the "Waqf", the Muslim authority in charge of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
History.
Due to the extreme political sensitivity of the site, few archaeological excavations have been conducted on the Temple Mount itself. Protests commonly occur whenever archaeologists conduct projects on or near the Mount.
Aside from visual observation of surface features, most other archaeological knowledge of the site comes from the 19th century survey carried out by Charles Wilson and Charles Warren. Warren was one of the first to excavate this area, exemplifying a new era of Biblical archaeology in the 1870s. In 1930, R.W. Hamilton, director of the British Mandate Antiquities Department, carried out the only archeological excavation ever undertaken at the Temple Mount's Aqsa Mosque by the British Mandate, the excavations show a Byzantine mosaic floor underneath the mosque that was likely the remains of a church or a monastery. In addition to the Byzantine mosaic, R.W. Hamilton also found a tile in the floor bearing the image of a centaur. It is believed this tile may be related to pagan religious construction on the Temple Mount during the Roman Period (135 - 325 CE).
Post-1967.
In 1967 the Religious Affairs Ministry began an unlicensed excavation. Starting at the western wall plaza, workers dug northward, under the Old City's Muslim Quarter.
Beginning in 1968, Israeli archeologists began excavations at the foot of the Temple Mount, immediately south of the al-Aqsa Mosque, uncovering Second Temple, Roman, Umayyad and Crusader remains.
In 1970, Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations to the south and west of the mosque. Over the period 1970–1988, the Israeli authorities excavated a tunnel passing immediately to the west of the Temple Mount, northwards from the Western Wall, that became known as the Western Wall Tunnel. They sometimes used mechanical excavators under the supervision of archeologists. Palestinians claim that both of these have caused cracks and structural weakening of the buildings in the Muslim Quarter of the city above. Israelis confirmed this danger:
In an article published in the Egyptian Al-Ahram Weekly in 2007, Palestinian journalist Khaled Amayreh listed Israeli encroachments on the Al-Aqsa Mosque: In 1977, digging continued and a large ancient tunnel was opened below the women's prayer area. A further tunnel was unearthed under the mosque, going from east to west, in 1979. In addition, in March 1984 the Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque, endangering the Islamic "Majlis" or council building. Israeli archaeologist Israel Finkelstein, however, asserts that "Palestinian accusations ... that tunnels are being dug under the Al-Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, are false. The closest excavation to the mosque is some 70 meters to its south". In 1981, Yehuda Meir Getz, rabbi of the Western Wall, had workmen open the ancient Warren's Gate, accessing the innards of the Temple Mount itself from the Western Wall Tunnel. Arabs on the Mount heard banging from one of the more than two dozen cisterns on the Mount. Israeli Government officials, upon being notified of the unauthorized breach, immediately ordered Warren's Gate resealed. The 2000-year-old stone gate was filled with cement, and remains cement-shut today.
Archeologist Leon Pressouyre, a UNESCO envoy who visited the site in 1998 and claims to have been prevented from meeting Israeli officials (in his own words, "Mr Avi Shoket, Israel's permanent delegate to UNESCO, had repeatedly opposed my mission and, when I expressed the wish to meet with his successor, Uri Gabay, I was denied an appointment", accuses the Israeli government of culpably neglecting to protect the Islamic period buildings uncovered in Israeli excavations. Later, Prof. Oleg Grabar of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton replaced Leon Pressouyre as the UNESCO envoy to investigate the Israeli allegations that antiquities are being destroyed by the Waqf on the Temple Mount. Initially, Grabar was denied access to the buildings by Israel for over a year, allegedly due to the threat of violence resulting from the al-Aqsa Intifada. His eventual conclusion was that the monuments are deteriorating largely because of conflicts over who is responsible for them, the Jordanian government, the local Palestinian Authority or the Israeli government.
1990s.
Western Wall Tunnel (1996).
After the Six Day War, the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Israel began the excavations aimed at exposing the continuation of the Western Wall. The excavations lasted almost twenty years and revealed many previously unknown facts about the history and geography of the Temple Mount.
The tunnel exposes a total length of 500m of the wall, revealing the methods of construction and the various activities in the vicinity of the Temple Mount. The excavations included many archaeological finds along the way, including discoveries from the Herodian period (streets, monumental masonry), sections of a reconstruction of the Western Wall dating to the Umayyad period, and various structures dating to the Ayyubid, Mamluk, and Hasmonean periods constructed to support buildings in the vicinity of the Temple Mount. Warren's Gate lies about into the tunnel. At the northern portion of the Western Wall, remains of a water channel, which originally supplied water to the Temple Mount, were found. The exact source of the channel is unknown, though it passes through an underground pool known as the Strouthion Pool. The water channel was dated to the Hasmonean period and was accordingly dubbed the Hasmonean Channel.
The biggest stone in the Western Wall often called the Western Stone is also revealed within the tunnel and ranks as one of the heaviest objects ever lifted by human beings without powered machinery. The stone has a length of 13.6 meters and an estimated width of between 3.5 and 4.5 meters; estimates place its weight at 570 tons.
In 1996, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu opened the Western Wall Tunnel near the site. Fueled by the allegation that the tunnel would undermine the Temple Mount, Palestinians protested. Consequently, gun battles in the West Bank and Gaza Strip killed 54 Palestinians and 14 Israeli soldiers.
Construction at Solomon's Stables (1996–1999).
In 1996 the Waqf began construction in the structures known since Crusader times as Solomon's Stables, and in the Eastern Hulda Gate passageway, allowed the area to be (re)opened as a prayer space called the "Marwani Musalla" capable of accommodating 7,000 individuals. In 1997, the Western Hulda Gate passageway was converted into another mosque.
According to "The New York Times", an emergency exit had been urged upon the Waqf by the Israeli police. In 1999, the Waqf agreed on its necessity, which was also acknowledged by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). But the IAA criticized the Waqf's use of bulldozers, and said that salvation archaeology needed to be performed first. Gabriel Barkay, an Israeli professor, said the construction demolished structures dating to the Twelfth Century Crusades, and went on without archaeological supervision. He said the construction used ancient stones from early Jewish buildings and used them to make modern ones. Israel Finkelstein has described the project as "the greatest devastation to have recently been inflicted on Jerusalem’s archaeological heritage".
In 2000, an Israeli high court rejected a petition to halt construction, saying the matter should be left to the Israeli government. Ehud Olmert, then mayor of Jerusalem, also criticized the construction. He ordered a halt to the construction, on grounds of archaeological damage, defying an Israeli government decision to allow excavations at the site. The Waqf rejected that Israel had any right to halt the construction. Formally, the "Waqf" does not recognize Israeli authority, though it had cooperated with Israel until the 1996 opening of Western Wall tunnel (see above).
The Temple Mount Sifting Project is an archaeological project established in 2005 and dedicated to recovering archaeological artifacts from the 300 truckloads of topsoil removed from the Temple Mount by the Waqf during the construction of the underground el-Marwani Mosque from 1996–1999. By 2006, the project had recovered numerous artifacts dating from the 8th to 7th centuries BCE from dirt removed in 1999 by the Islamic Religious Trust (Waqf) from the Solomon's Stables area of the Temple Mount. These include stone weights for weighing silver and a First Temple period bulla, or seal impression, containing ancient Hebrew writing, which may have belonged to a well-known family of priests mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah.
2000s.
In autumn 2002, a bulge of about 70 cm was reported in the southern retaining wall part of the Temple Mount. It was feared that part of the wall might seriously deteriorate or even collapse. The Waqf would not permit detailed Israeli inspection but came to an agreement with Israel that led to a team of Jordanian engineers inspecting the wall in October. They recommended repair work that involved replacing or resetting most of the stones in the affected area, which covers 2,000 square feet (200 m2) and is located 25 feet (8 m) from the top of the wall. Repairs were completed before January 2004. The restoration of 250 square meters of wall cost 100,000 Jordanian dinars ($140,000).
On February 11, 2004, the eastern wall of the Temple Mount was damaged by an earthquake. The damage threatens to topple sections of the wall into the area known as Solomon's Stables.
On February 16, 2004, a few days after the earthquake, a portion of a stone retaining wall, supporting the ramp that leads from the Western Wall plaza to the Gate of the Moors on the Temple Mount, collapsed. Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization condemned the "excavations carried out by the Israeli occupying authorities under the Aqsa Mosque" which they claimed caused the collapse of the path.
Mughrabi Gate ramp reconstruction (February 2007).
After a landslide in 2004 left the earthen ramp leading to the politically sensitive access point known as the Mugrabi Gate unsafe and in danger of collapse, the Israel Antiquities Authority started work on the construction of a temporary wooden pedestrian pathway to the Temple Mount. Muslim officials accused Israel of designs on the foundations of Al Aqsa mosque. Ismail Haniya — then Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas leader — called on Palestinians to unite to protest the excavations, while Fatah said they would end their ceasefire with Israel. The excavations provoked anger throughout the Islamic world. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called on the international community to stop the dig: "Israel's actions violate the mosque's sacred nature and risk destroying its religious and Islamic features." Malaysia condemned Israel for the excavation works around and beneath the Al-Aqsa Mosque and for willfully destroying religious, cultural and heritage sites. King Abdullah II of Jordan "strongly condemned the Israeli actions against worshipers at Al Aqsa Mosque, stressing that Jordan would continue its contacts with the Arab and Islamic worlds and the international community to halt Israel's excavation work in the area". The secretary-general of the 57-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, expressed his anguish and dismay at the world's silence on Israel's "blatant moves to Judaize Jerusalem and change the holy city's historic character." He said "the excavation work being carried out by Israel constituted the gravest threat ever to one of Islam's three holiest mosques"
Israel denied all charges, calling them "ludicrous". As a result of the furor, Israeli authorities installed cameras to film excavation work being carried out near the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The footage was broadcast live on the Internet, in an attempt to ease widespread anger in the Muslim world. 
A March 2007 UNESCO report on the incident cleared the Israeli team of wrongdoing, saying that the excavations "concern areas external
to the Western Wall and are limited to the surface of the pathway and its northern side ... o work is being conducted inside the Haram es-Sharif, nor may the nature of the works underway be reported, at this stage, as constituting a threat to the stability of the Western Wall and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The work area ends at approximately 10 metres distance from the Western Wall. It is conducted with light equipment, picks and shovels, and it is supervised and documented according to professional standards." The report nonetheless advised the cessation of work, as the aims of gathering information had been met, and consultation with concerned parties. On March 20, 2007 the Turkish Government sent a technical team to inspect and report on the excavations to the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Electrical cable replacement (July 2007).
In July 2007 the Waqf began digging a 400-metre-long, 1.5-metre-deep trench from the northern side of the Temple Mount compound to the Dome of the Rock in order to replace 40-year-old electric cables in the area. The dig, carried out by the Jerusalem Electricity Company, was approved by the Israeli police, but the Israel Antiquities Authority declined to comment whether it had approved the excavations. Israeli archaeologists accused the Waqf of a deliberate act of cultural vandalism. The Committee for the Prevention of Destruction of Antiquities on the Temple Mount criticized the use of a tractor for excavation at the Temple Mount "without real, professional and careful archaeological supervision involving meticulous documentation". Archaeologist Eilat Mazar said: “There is disappointment at the turning of a blind eye and the ongoing contempt for the tremendous archaeological importance of the Temple Mount ...", "... Using heavy machinery and with little documentation, can damage ancient relics and erase evidence of the presence of the biblical structures. Any excavation, even if for technical reasons, must be documented, photographed and the dirt sifted for any remains of relics." Dr. Gavriel Barkai slammed the way the excavations were being carried out stating that "They should be using a toothbrush, not a bulldozer". He maintains that "some man-worked stones have been found in the trench ... as well as remnants of a wall that, according to all our estimations, are from a structure in one of the outer courtyards in the Holy Temple." Archaeologist Zachi Zweig said a tractor used to dig the trench damaged the foundation of a 7-yard-wide wall "that might have been a remnant of the Second Temple."
The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Muhammad Ahmad Hussein, rejected the Israeli charges. "We don't harm the antiquities, we are the ones who are taking care of the antiquities, unlike others who destroy them." Yusuf Natsheh of the Islamic Waqf dismissed the claims, saying "the area has been dug many times" and argued that "remains unearthed would be from the 16th or 17th century Ottoman period". He said that the work was urgently needed to maintain the al-Aqsa compound as an important religious institution. "We regret some Israeli groups try to use archaeology to achieve political ends, but their rules of archaeology do not apply to the Haram; it is a living religious site in an occupied land."
In September 2007, the Orthodox Union condemned Waqf Excavations on the Temple Mount. The Anti-Defamation League's Abraham Foxman said work on the Temple Mount must stop immediately. "We are especially concerned because there is a history of Muslim religious leaders treating Israeli religious and cultural artifacts on the Temple Mount, not to mention the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, with contempt".
Finds.
In 2007, artifacts dating to the eighth to sixth centuries BCE were described as being possibly the first physical evidence of human activity at the Temple Mount during the First Temple period. The findings included animal bones; ceramic bowl rims, bases, and body sherds; the base of a juglet used to pour oil; the handle of a small juglet; and the rim of a storage jar.

Third Stanhope Ministry

The Third Stanhope Ministry was the tenth ministry of the Government of the Australian Capital Territory, and was led by Labor Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and his deputy Katy Gallagher. It was sworn in on 11 November 2008, following the Stanhope government's re-election for a third term in the 2008 election. It ended on 16 May 2011 with the appointment of the First Gallagher Ministry following the resignation of Jon Stanhope and subsequent election of Katy Gallagher as Chief Minister.
The new ministry saw no change in personnel from the previous ministry, but major changes to the portfolios of respective ministers. These included Jon Stanhope's assumption of responsibilities for territory and municipal services, including a new distinct transport ministry; Katy Gallagher taking the difficult corrections portfolio from Simon Corbell; Corbell taking the environment ministry from Stanhope and the police ministry from John Hargreaves, and Hargreaves taking the industrial relations portfolio from Andrew Barr.
First arrangement.
This covers the period from 11 November 2008 (when the Ministry was sworn in) until 9 November 2009.
Second arrangement.
The year-old government initiated a significant reshuffle of the ministry on 9 November 2009, coinciding with the resignation of John Hargreaves and the appointment of a replacement minister in Joy Burch. There was one minor change after this point, when, one month later, on 1 December 2009, an additional ministry for land and property services was added to Stanhope's responsibilities, and an additional ministry for children and young people was restored (held by Andrew Barr in the first arrangement) to Joy Burch.

Gatsby (sandwich)

A Gatsby is a South African sandwich very similar in content and method of preparation as a hoagie in the United States. It is mostly popular in the Western Cape province. 
Gatsbies usually consist of long bread rolls cut lengthwise and opened up to form a sort of cradle which is filled with various fillings. While the choice of filling in a Gatsby varies widely depending on customer preference and vendor, one standard item is usually "hot chips" i.e. French fries.
Different varieties of Gatsbys include masala steak, chicken, polony, Vienna sausage, calamari, fish, and chargrilled steak.
Gatsbies originated in the Cape Flats area of Cape Town, where people would often buy large rolls and fill them with whatever leftovers they had, and split them four ways. This practice has carried on in modern times, with gatsbies being bought in full, half or quarter sizes.
History.
Rashaad Pandy—the proprietor of a fish and chips fast food store called Super Fisheries located in Athlone, Cape Town—claims to have invented it one night in 1976, when he tried to feed some day labourers after he had run out of fish.

Plot.
Quim is driving through an isolated rural area and arrives at a petrol station where it is revealed he is trying to get in contact with a woman named Sofia. Whilst on the phone he spots a woman shoplifting and meets her in the bathroom where they have sex and she steals his wallet. In an attempt to follow her to recover his belongings his car is shot at, and, when he pulls over to inspect the damage, a man with a rifle and dog appears and shoots him in the leg. He manages to get back into his car but he only gets so far until he discovers the road is blocked by a bulldozer and fallen tree. Leaving the car in an attempt to get a signal for his phone to call for help he hears a rumbling back at the road where he left his car and promptly drives back the way he came, only to run over his apparent pursuer. 
Shortly after his car breaks down and he leaves for the woods where he meets Bea, the woman from the petrol station, who seems to be lost as well and denies having stolen Quim's wallet. One of her car tyres has suffered a puncture which Quim reveals was actually caused by a gunshot. They rush to repair the tire and Quim suddenly becomes panicked and they drive off. They drive past Quim's car and see that it has been severely vandalised. The two continue driving until they come across an abandoned roadside café. After they break in and search for supplies they are met by a pair of policemen who are highly suspicious and violently subdue and question them. They do not believe Quim but once he reveals he has run one of the attackers over they agree to take them back to the body to check on his story. After they reach the body Quim is handcuffed to the car and the police investigate the body. (at this point you should note that there was originally a rifle next to the body, this reveals the presence of an accomplice) The two police officers are fired upon and seemingly killed. After a tense moment hiding in the car Bea manages to leave and find a key to unlock Quim's handcuffs. They leave and run through the forest but one of the police officers has survived with a minor gunshot wound to the shoulder. He is still highly suspicious of the two thinking that they had something to do with the snipers. The trio run away through the forest, but upon reaching a particularly hazardous river they are shot at once again and the other police officer is killed soon after.
Quim and Bea take shelter for the night, with Quim making attempts to find out about Bea but she brushes him off, before being hunted once again in the morning by their pursuers. Bea takes a bullet to her shoulder and they both end up trapped in a large pit unable to climb out. With Bea's help Quim manages to get out but as he looks for a stick to help her he hears barking, panicks and runs. After getting a fair distance away he changes his mind and begins to run back but before he gets back he hears a gunshot. As they make their way up a gulley and Quim, their pursuers drawing closer, chooses to abandon her to her fate. With Bea weeping and trapped in the gulley the hunters are finally revealed to be a pair of young boys who proceed to murder her. They are casual about it, with one remarking at how her blood splattered his companion's face and taking a picture of the body with a mobile phone. The film then switches to the viewpoint of the hunters as they track Quim through the forest. Quim flees alone, his hunters revelling in the sport. Eventually they come across a barn and stop for a break. When one of the boys starts adding points for a deer he had killed earlier the other becomes annoyed and accuses him of changing the rules to suit himself. They have an argument and it is revealed they are brothers, during this Quim manages to lock them in the barn and escape. Quim escapes to an abandoned village, the two brothers catch up with him and a tense game of cat-and-mouse ensues, but he manages to ambush and kill one of the boys by hiding in a pool of water, showing deep regret afterwards. The other brother approaches Quim, weeping and angry after his brothers death, and thrusts his gun at him, but Quim embraces him, only to have the boy struggle free and shoot himself off-camera. Quim weeps by the brother's bodies, thrusting his hands to the heavens as though in prayer, with the boy's dog that had allowed them to track Quim and his companions appearing soon afterwards and Quim putting a hand wearily to his head before the credits roll.
Release.
The film had its North America premiere on 8 September 2007 as part of the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival and was released as "King of the Hill" by the Weinstein Company.

LT&amp;SR 1 Class

The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway 1 class was a class of 4-4-2T suburban tank engines. Thirty-six were built between 1880–1892, by Sharp, Stewart and Company and Nasmyth, Wilson and Company. They were the first locomotives owned by the LTSR, as previously all train services had been run by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) under contract.
They were ostensibly designed by Thomas Whitelegg and were the first 4-4-2T locomotives to operate in Britain. However, documentation exists to suggest that the design was actually by William Adams, then working for the GER.
Numbering.
On the LTSR they were numbered 1–36 and named for places on or near their railway line. In 1912, the LTSR was absorbed by the Midland Railway and the locomotives were renumbered 2110–2145 and the names removed. At the grouping in 1923, all passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and at first retained their former MR numbers. However between 1923 and 1927 twenty-five were progressively renumbered—2110–2119 to 2200–2209 in 1923, 2120–2124 to 2210–2214 in 1925, and 2125–2134 to 2190–2199. In 1930, all 36 were renumbered in the 2056–2091 range.
Retirements started in 1929, and by 1936, all had been withdrawn. None were preserved.

Second Carnell Ministry

The Second Carnell Ministry was the sixth ministry of the Government of the Australian Capital Territory, and was led by Liberal Chief Minister Kate Carnell and her deputy, Gary Humphries. It was sworn in on 31 March 1998, after the Carnell government's re-election for a second term at the 1998 election. The ministry operated until 9 October 2000, when Carnell resigned as Chief Minister after being informed by key independent members, Paul Osborne and Dave Rugendyke, that they would no longer support her leadership due to her handling of the Bruce Stadium affair. Deputy Chief Minister Humphries was sworn in as her replacement, and Carnell subsequently left politics.
The new ministry contained two major changes from the previous ministry: the second Chief Minister, Trevor Kaine (who subsequently quit the party), and a minister in the first Carnell Ministry was dumped in favour of Brendan Smyth, a member of the House of Representatives for the electorate of Canberra (from 1995 to 1996) and newly elected to the Assembly, and the consolidation of most ministries into a series of larger portfolios.
On 31 March 1998, one month after the initial ministry was sworn in, veteran independent member, Michael Moore, was appointed minister. Moore continued to sit as an independent in the Assembly, despite serving as Health Minister in the Carnell Liberal government; an appointment that increased the number of ministers to five. 
A further change occurred on 7 August 1999, when Carnell divested the position of Treasurer to her deputy, Humphries, in response to mounting pressure due to her handling of the Bruce Stadium affair.

Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39)

The Ottoman–Safavid War of 1623–1639 was the last of a series of conflicts fought between the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia, then the two major powers of the Near East, over control of Mesopotamia. After initial Persian success in capturing Baghdad and most of modern Iraq, the war became a stalemate, as the Persians were unable to press further into the Ottoman Empire, and the Ottomans themselves were distracted by wars in Europe and weakened by internal turmoil. Eventually, the Ottomans were able to recover Baghdad, and the signing of the Treaty of Zuhab ended the war in an Ottoman victory, with Mesopotamia remaining thenceforth in Ottoman hands, until lost in the aftermath of World War I.
Background.
Starting in 1514, for over a century the Ottoman Empire and Savafid Persia were engaged in almost constant warfare over control of the Caucasus and Mesopotamia. The two states were the greatest powers of the Middle East, and the rivalry was further fueled by dogmatic differences: the Ottomans were Sunnis, while the Safavids were staunchly Shia Muslims of the Qizilbash sect, and seen as heretics by the Ottomans.
After the Battle of Chaldiran eliminated Safavid influence in Anatolia, during the war of 1532–1555 the Ottomans conquered Arab Iraq, taking Baghdad in 1534 and securing recognition of their gains by the Treaty of Amasya in 1555. Peace lasted for two decades before another war began in 1578. It ended with the Treaty of Istanbul in 1590, with a clear Ottoman victory: the Ottomans occupied Georgia, Yerevan, and even the former Safavid capital, Tabriz. The Persians were hard pressed, as the Ottoman advances were combined with an attack by the Shaybanids into Persian Khorasan.
The new Persian Shah, Abbas I, reorganized his army, raising the new "ghulam" infantry in imitation of the Janissaries, and bided his time. In 1603, he launched an offensive that retook Tabriz, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The Ottomans, distracted by wars with the Habsburg Monarchy in Europe, failed to offer effective resistance. After a successful conclusion of the War against the Mughals, feeling encouraged by the internal turmoil within the Ottoman Empire that followed the murder of Sultan Osman II, Abbas resolved to attack the Ottoman possessions in Iraq.
The war.
The Shah's opportunity came with a series of rebellions in the Ottoman Empire: Abaza Mehmed Pasha, the governor of Erzurum, rose in rebellion, while Baghdad had been since 1621 in the hands of an officer of the Janissaries, the "Subashi" Bakr, and his followers. Bakr had sought his recognition as the local pasha from the Porte, but the Sultan had ordered Hafız Ahmed Pasha, the governor of Diyarbakir, to intervene. Bakr then turned to Abbas, who sent troops to Bakr's aid. To forestall a Persian capture of Baghdad, Hafız Ahmed quickly restored relations with Bakr, who in turn returned to the Ottoman allegiance. In response, the Persians besieged Baghdad, and took it on 14 January 1624, with the aid of Bakr's son, Muhammad. The fall of the city was followed by the massacre of a large part of its Sunni inhabitants, as the Shah endeavored to transform Baghdad into a purely Shiite city.
The fall of Baghdad was a major blow to Ottoman prestige. Ottoman garrisons and the local tribes began to defect, and the Persians soon captured most of Iraq, including the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul and the Shia holy shrines of Najaf and Karbala, which the Shah visited. In 1625, Hafız Ahmed Pasha, now Grand Vizier, marched to retake Baghdad. Despite a "scorched earth" policy ordered by the Shah, the Ottoman army reached Baghdad and invested it in November on three sides. The Ottoman assaults on the city managed to penetrate the outer fortifications, but failed to take the city before the arrival of a relief army under Shah Abbas. The Ottomans then withdrew within their strongly fortified camp, and continued to prosecute the siege. In response, Abbas decided to intercept Ottoman supply convoys. This strategy bore fruit: the Ottomans were forced to risk an attack on the Persian army, which was repulsed with heavy losses, and on 4 July 1626, the Ottoman army lifted the siege and withdrew to Mosul.
In 1629, the Ottomans, under the new and capable Grand Vizier Gazi Hüsrev Pasha, and having secured peace with the Habsburgs, mustered their forces for another offensive. A severe winter, including floods, made operations in central Iraq impossible, however, and Khüsrev turned his army east, invading Persia proper. On 4 May 1630, he routed the Persians under Zainal Khan Begdeli Shamlu in battle at Mahidasht near Kermanshah and proceeded to sack the city of Hamadan. Khüsrev Pasha then turned back towards Baghdad and besieged it in November. However the siege had to be lifted soon, as the onset of another heavy winter threatened his lines of communication. In the wake of his withdrawal, the Persians re-established their control of Iraq, and subdued the rebellious Kurdish populations. The next few years saw constant raiding and skirmishes, without either side claiming any decisive advantage. Shah Safi sent a peace delegation to the Ottoman court, but the new Grand Vizier, Tabanıyassi Mehmed Pasha rejected its demands. The Caucasian front of the Persians flared up again in 1633, when the restless Georgian kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti, which, under the rule of King Teimuraz, defied Safavid sovereignty. In 1634, Rustam Khan, a Georgian convert, was sent by the Shah to subdue them. Teimuraz was defeated, but managed to escape to safety in Imereti. He would however manage to restore himself on the throne of Kakheti in 1638, and even win Persian recognition of this fact.
In 1635, in a conscious effort to emulate his warrior predecessors, Sultan Murad IV himself took up the leadership of the army. The Ottomans took Revan (on 8 August) and plundered Tabriz. The victorious Sultan returned in triumph to Constantinople, but his victories were short-lived: in the spring of the next year, Shah Safi retook Revan and defeated an Ottoman army. Renewed Persian peace proposals failed, and in 1638, Murad IV himself led an army against Baghdad. The city fell in December after a siege of 39 days, effectively restoring Ottoman control over Iraq, and peace negotiations began soon after.
Aftermath.
The Treaty of Zuhab, concluded on 17 May 1639, finally settled the Ottoman–Persian frontier, with Yerevan remaining Persian, and Iraq ceded to the Ottomans. Mesopotamia, which had formed an important part of various Persian empires from the time of the Achaemenids, was irrevocably lost. The peace established a permanent equilibrium of power in the region, and despite future conflicts and minor adjustments, the frontier postulated by the treaty remains to this day the western border of Iran with Iraq and Turkey.

SC Concordia von 1907

SC Concordia von 1907 is a German football club from Marienthal, a quarter in the Wandsbek borough of the city of Hamburg.
History.
Early years.
The club was formed in 1907 as SC Concordia Wandsbeck by a small group of seven enthusiastic cycle polo players, with football being only the second sport of the new association. However, cycle polo soon became unfashionable due to frequent crashes and football took over as the clubs main interest. The clubs name "Concordia" originated by Walter Stautz who saw it engraved in a medal. 
In 1923, the club merged with another local club, "Germania", and in 1937, changed its name to the current one.
1921 to 1933.
The club did not reach the highest level of play in the city of Hamburg till after World War I. In 1921–22, it played in the "Kreisliga Groß-Hamburg – Alsterkreis", one of the two highest divisions in the city at the time, reaching sixth place out of eight teams. It repeated this performance in 1923 and 1924, but came last in its division in 1924–25. However, the team managed to retain its spot in the league through a good performance in the relegation round. Struggling on in the following season, "Concordia" was relegated back to the second level in 1927, after finishing last in its division again. 
In the "A-Klasse Hamburg – Staffel 3" (II), the club delivered an average performance in 1927–28, earning a fourth place finish. In the 1929–30 season, the club declined further, coming last in what was now the "Bezirksliga Hamburg – Alster Staffel" and finding itself relegated to the third division.
1933 to 1945.
"Concordia" returned to first division football in 1939, when it won promotion to the "Gauliga Nordmark", then the highest football league in northern Germany. Due to the outbreak of World War II, the league was split into two regional groups for 1939–40, but reunited the next season. "Concordia" suffered a last place finish in 1941 and was relegated from the "Gauliga", unable to return to the league which was disbanded in 1945.
1945 to 1963.
Following the war, the club became one of thirteen clubs in the Stadtliga Hamburg, the highest league in the region until 1947. In 1946–47, "Concordia" came third in this league and, together with Hamburger SV, FC St Pauli and Victoria Hamburg, was admitted to the new Oberliga Nord (I).
In Oberliga play, the club managed several mid-table finishes, with a sixth place in 1949–50 being its best performance. In 1953, it was relegated to the Amateurliga Hamburg (II) after coming 15th out of 16 teams. In three seasons in this league, the team won two championships and a runners-up spot and won promotion back to the Oberliga in 1956.
With the exception of a sixth place result in 1957–58, the club continually flirted with relegation, but survived managed to survive until 1963 when the Oberligas were disbanded in favor of the new nationwide first division Fußball-Bundesliga.
1963 to 1974.
"Concordia" qualified for the new second division Regionalliga Nord despite only coming 14th in 1963. In its first Regionalliga season, "Cordi" continued to struggle but improved somewhat after 1964. Another sixth place finish in 1967 stands out as the club's best performance in this era, but by 1970 it was relegated once more, to the tier three Landesliga Hamburg. After three seasons, the team returned to the Regionalliga for what was the final season for the Regionalligen before they were replaced by the "2nd Bundesligas" in 1974.
1974 to 2008.
A tenth place in 1974 was not enough to qualify for the new second division and "Cordi" became part of the newly recreated Oberliga Nord (III). It remained in this league for the next 17 seasons, without ever coming close to promotion, a fifth place in 1977 being its best result.
In 1991, the club's luck finally run out and it lost its relegation battle, having to step down to the Verbandsliga Hamburg (IV). After an eighth place in its first season there, it earned two championships in the following campaigns, with their second title earning the team promotion to the new Regionalliga Nord (III).
"Concordia" enjoyed three season there before falling to relegation again and having to return to the "Oberliga". After three seasons in the "Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein", the club was relegated again, back to the "Verbandsliga". A title in this league however moved the team straight back up and it enjoyed three excellent seasons in the "Oberliga" with two third places in 2003 and 2004 being the best results.
Upon recreation of the "Oberliga Nord" in 2004, the club was immediately relegated to the "Verbandsliga" and has since spent its time there. In 2008, the "Verbandsliga Hamburg" was renamed "Oberliga Hamburg".
In the final of the Hamburg Cup they won against Altonaer FC 93 with 2:1, so they started in the DFB-Pokal in 2009/2010. There they defeated by TuS Koblenz 0:4.

Dan Stearns

Daniel Eckford Stearns (born October 17, 1861 in Buffalo, New York – June 28, 1944 in Glendale, California), commonly known as "Ecky" Stearns, was a Major League Baseball first baseman from -. He played for the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, Kansas City Cowboys, Baltimore Orioles, and Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA).
At the start of the 1882 season, clubs playing in the American Association had their players wear non-matching silk uniforms, with a different color and/or pattern corresponding to each position in the field. Accordingly, on Opening Day for the Red Stockings, Stearns wore an unusual candy-striped jersey.
On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2–0 win by Louisville. Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions.
Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season.
Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits. That team finished with a dominant record of 90–25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century.
Stearns is also notable as one of the first Jews to play Major League Baseball. His status as such made him popular with Jewish youths who were fans of the game.

Gary Stackhouse (born August 21, 1965 in Saint John, New Brunswick) is a Canadian entertainer and radio host. Following a successful career as a touring and recording musician in Canada's Maritime Provinces in the 1980s, Stackhouse turned to a career in radio. He has worked in news, production and creative writing in addition to hosting on air shows in New Brunswick and in Southern Ontario at Brantford's CKPC-FM 92.1. As its first Program Director, Stackhouse was instrumental in the launch of radio station NewSong FM (CINB) in his hometown of Saint John, New Brunswick in 2001.

He also hosted that station's morning show as “Captain Stack in the Morning”. He left the position in 2007 after disagreements with the station ownership over the direction of the station.
Stackhouse's musical career began during his time attending Saint John High School, where he played with numerous bands, including roots rock outfit "The Rockabilly Fury".

He has had several minor regional hits recorded under the band pseudonym "Magic Sandwich", including "Wash Away" (originally written as an attempt to gain an audition for the TV reality show ""), "Always Call You Friend" (a Valentine's gift for his then-girlfriend) and "Piggy Man" (dedicated to CJEF owner Geoff Rivett, who was his employer at the time). 
During his time in Brantford, he formed "The Chas Maverick Connection" with Greg Moulton (drums and vocals) and Mike Ellsworth (bass and vocals), friends and fellow co workers, originally as a throw away band for the Brantford Santa Claus parade, but became popular performing at several charity events, including the Katrina Hurricane benefit at the Brantford Sanderson Centre, and recording many cover songs with the band, on the cd Kens On Remote. Stackhouse has also become known for writing and performing parody songs. Stackhouse is also the lead singer and plays guitar and keyboards for the band "The Accidental Legends", also featuring Ryan Massey (bass), Bill Brayley (guitar) and Peter Hanson (drums).

LB&amp;SCR J1 class

The LB&SCR J1 and J2 classes were 4-6-2 steam tank locomotives designed by D. E. Marsh for express passenger services on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway.
History.
Following the success of his I3 4-4-2 tank locomotive class, Douglas Earle Marsh decided to enlarge the class to create a tank locomotive capable of hauling the heaviest London-Brighton express trains. The first locomotive No. 325 was classified "J1" and completed by Brighton Works in December 1910. It incorporated a Schmidt superheater and Stephenson valve gear. After initial modifications to the firebox to improve its coal consumption, it proved to be a successful design. A second locomotive was therefore ordered in May 1911, but Marsh soon afterwards went on prolonged sick leave and all work ceased. 
Marsh's successor Lawson Billinton made detailed changes to the design before work on the second locomotive recommenced, incorporating the Walschaerts valve gear. No. 326 was therefore classified as "J2" and completed in March 1912.
Both locomotives performed well, although No. 326 was considered the faster. They were used on the heaviest trains, together with the H1 and H2 classes until after the formation of Southern Railway in January 1923.
During 1925 and 1926, the two classes were gradually replaced on the heaviest London-Brighton express trains by the "King Arthur" and "River" classes, and were used on lighter express services until the electrification of the London to Brighton line in 1935. Thereafter they were transferred to Eastbourne and used on London expresses from that town until they ceased following the outbreak of the Second World War. 
The two locomotives spent the early months of the War in store but were later transferred to Tunbridge Wells. They both survived into British Railways (BR) ownership in 1948, but in June 1951 they were both replaced by new LMS Fairburn designed 2-6-4T locomotives and were withdrawn.

List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire

Sultans of the Ottoman Empire, members of the Ottoman Dynasty, ruled over that vast transcontinental empire from 1299 to 1922. At its height, it spanned from Hungary in the north to Somalia in the south, and from Algeria in the west to Iran in the east. Administered at first from the city of Bursa in Anatolia, the empire's capital was moved to Edirne in 1366 and then to Constantinople (currently known as Istanbul) in 1453 following its capture from the Byzantine Empire. The Ottoman Empire's early years have been the subject of varying narratives due to the difficulty of discerning fact from legend; nevertheless, most modern scholars agree that the empire came into existence around 1299 and that its first ruler was Osman I Khan (leader) of the Kayı tribe of the Oghuz Turks. The Ottoman Dynasty he founded was to endure for six centuries through the reigns of 36 sultans. The Ottoman Empire disappeared as a result of the defeat of the Central Powers with whom it had allied itself during World War I. The partitioning of the empire by the victorious Allies and the ensuing Turkish War of Independence led to the abolition of the sultanate and the birth of the modern Republic of Turkey.
Ottoman State Organization.
The Ottoman State was an absolute monarchy during much of its existence. The sultan was at the apex of the hierarchical Ottoman system and acted in political, military, judicial, social, and religious capacities under a variety of titles. He was theoretically responsible only to God and God's law (the Islamic "şeriat", known in Arabic as "sharia"), of which he was the chief executor. His heavenly mandate was reflected in Irano-Islamic titles such as "shadow of God on Earth" ( "zill Allah fi'l-alem") and "caliph on the earth" ( "khalife-i ru-yi zemin"). All offices were filled by his authority, and every law was issued by him in the form of a decree called "firman" (). He was the supreme military commander and had the official title to all land. Ertoghrul served as the elected leader of the Ottomans from 1230 until his death in 1281. In 1281, Ertoghrul's son, Osman, became elected leader of the Ottomans. From 1299 until his death in 1324, Osman served as Osman I "Sultan of the Ottoman Empire."
After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Ottoman sultans came to regard themselves as the successors of the Roman Empire, hence their occasional use of the titles Caesar ( "kaysar") and Emperor. Following the conquest of Egypt in 1517, Selim I also adopted the title of caliph, thus claiming to be the universal Muslim ruler. Newly enthroned Ottoman rulers were girded with the Sword of Osman, an important ceremony that served as the equivalent of European monarchs' coronation. A non-girded sultan was not eligible to have his children included in the line of succession.
Although theocratic and absolute in theory and in principle, the sultan's powers were limited in practice. Political decisions had to take into account the opinions and attitudes of important members of the dynasty, the bureaucratic and military establishments, as well as religious leaders. From the 17th century onwards, the empire entered into a long-term period of stagnation, during which the sultans were much enfeebled. Many of them ended up being deposed by the powerful Janissary corps. Despite being barred from inheriting the throne, women of the Imperial Harem—especially the reigning sultan's mother, known as the Valide Sultan—also played an important behind-the-scenes political role, effectively ruling the empire during the period known as the sultanate of women.
The declining powers of the sultans are evidenced by the difference in reign lengths between early sultans and later ones. Suleiman I, who ruled the empire when it was at its zenith in the 16th century, had a reign of 46 years, the longest in Ottoman history. Murad V, who ruled in the late 19th-century period of decline, had the shortest reign on record: he was in power for just 93 days before being deposed. Constitutionalism was only established during the reign of Murad V's successor, Abdülhamid II, who thus became the empire's last absolute ruler and its reluctant first constitutional monarch. Although Abdülhamid abolished parliament and the constitution to return to personal rule, he was again forced in 1908 to reinstall constitutionalism and was deposed. Since 2009, the head of the Ottoman dynasty and pretender to the defunct Ottoman throne has been Bayezid Osman, a great-grandson of Abdülmecid I.
List of sultans.
The table below lists Ottoman sultans, as well as the last Ottoman caliph, in chronological order. The tughras were the calligraphic seals or signatures used by Ottoman sultans. They were displayed on all official documents as well as on coins, and were far more important in identifying a sultan than his portrait. The "Notes" column contains information on each sultan's parentage and fate. When a sultan's reign did not end through a natural death, the reason is indicated in bold. For earlier rulers, there is usually a time gap between the moment a sultan's reign ended and the moment his successor was enthroned. This is because the Ottomans in that era practiced what historian Quataert has described as "survival of the fittest, not eldest, son": when a sultan died, his sons had to fight each other for the throne until a victor emerged. Because of the infighting and numerous fratricides that occurred, a sultan's death date therefore did not always coincide with the accession date of his successor. In 1617, the law of succession changed from survival of the fittest to a system based on agnatic seniority ( "ekberiyet"), whereby the throne went to the oldest male of the family. This in turn explains why from the 17th century onwards a deceased sultan was rarely succeeded by his own son, but usually by an uncle or brother. Agnatic seniority was retained until the abolition of the sultanate, despite unsuccessful attempts in the 19th century to replace it with primogeniture.
The official full style of the Ottoman Sultans was:

Body identification

Body identification is a subfield of forensic science wherein investigators need to identify a body. 
Forensic (literally, "for the courts") purposes are served by rigorous scientific forensic identification techniques, but these are generally preceded by simply asking bystanders or other persons for the victim's name.
If a body is not badly decomposed or damaged, two persons (or one) who knew the deceased well should visually confirm the identity.
Authorities will also compare supportive documents such as driver's license, passport, or other authoritative photo ID before accepting a personal identification with which to further their investigative and/or forensic purposes.
Of course, any formal investigation should "reality check" additional forensic and scientific evidence to reinforce or question the supposed identity of the victim.

Song of Kali

Song of Kali is a horror novel published in 1985 by Dan Simmons. It was the winner of the 1986 World Fantasy Award. The story deals with an American intellectual who travels to Calcutta, where he becomes embroiled in mysterious and horrific events at the centre of which lies a cult that worships Kali.
Plot summary.
Robert Luzcak is sent by the magazine he works for to Calcutta to locate recently written poetry alleged to have been written by a poet, M. Das, who has been thought dead for the last eight years. He travels there with his Indian wife and their infant child.
On arriving, he is met by Krishna, a local intellectual who claims to have been asked to assist them by a mutual friend. The next day he meets with the local writers guild who were the source of the few bits of poetry that made their way to America. When he asks to meet Das, he is told that it is out of the question.
Robert considers leaving Calcutta at this point, his duty done, but feels that something is missing and that he doesn't have enough material for an interesting article at this point. The night before he and his family are to leave, Krishna returns and takes Robert to a man who can provide him with information relevant to his story.
The man tells how he and a friend had tried to join a religious secret society dedicated to Kali, a Hindu goddess associated with death and destruction. One of the prerequisites was for each initiate to bring a corpse to a secret temple, there to be laid at the feet of a statue of Kali. This man's corpse, bloated and decayed after being dredged from the river is chosen by Kali and vivified by her, becoming animated. The corpse is that of the poet, Das.
Armed with this tale, Robert again insists on the writers guild allowing him to see Das. This time they agree. He is brought to the poet, who seems to be in the advanced stages of leprosy. Das seems to corroborate the story of his return from death, but Robert again refuses to believe it. Robert is given an extensive collection of Das's poetry, which is very different from his earlier work, describing dark, mystical, grotesque, and apocalyptic happenings. He is asked by Das to bring him books of poetry.
Becoming concerned at the eerie, and sometimes frightening, events that he has experienced, Robert attempts to send his wife and child home, but they are unable to get a flight. Concealing a gun (given to him previously by Krishna) in one of the books he has bought for Das, he returns to the poet. He leaves the books and goes, but, as he exits the house, hears two gunshots. Das is dead. Robert is captured by guards and knocked unconscious. He awakens being taken somewhere in the back of a truck, but manages to escape, with Krishna's help. He returns to the hotel, to find that their child has been kidnapped.
After a couple of days of dead-end leads, a couple is caught trying to smuggle jewels hidden within the child's body. With their child dead, Robert and his wife return to America.
Robert decides to destroy the poetry, and, gradually, their relationship returns to normal.
Whispers can still be heard, though, of the Song of Kali, the condition of humanity dominated by hatred and violence, perfectly embodied by the squalor and chaos of Calcutta.

Tournier v National Provincial and Union Bank of England

Tournier v National Provincial and Union Bank of England 1 KB 461 was a landmark legal case in the United Kingdom. It established the conditions under which banks owed confidentiality to their clients, allowing four circumstances wherein banks were not required to guard privacy: where compelled by (1) law, (2) public duty, (3) the interest of the bank, or (4) where the client had consented, even implicitly, to disclosure.
In this case the bank disclosed to its customer's employer the fact that one of the customer's unpaid cheques was drawn in favour of a bookmaker's account. As a result, the customer's employer did not renew his contract with the customer. The Court of Appeal held that confidentiality was an implied term in the customer's contract and that any breach could give rise to liability in damages if loss results.

Hoćemo gusle

Hoćemo gusle (trans. "We Want Gusle") is the second studio album released in 1989 by Montenegrin-Serbian musician Rambo Amadeus.
The track "Amerika i Engleska (biće zemlja proleterska)" was originally supposed to be named "Kataklizma komunizma" (Cataclysm of Communism) but powers that be wouldn't allow it. The album title pokes fun at a bizarre event from the 1989 so-called anti-bureaucratic revolution protests in Montenegro that swept Milo Đukanović, Momir Bulatović, and Svetozar Marović into power. Protesters were heard chanting "Hoćemo Ruse" ("We want the Russians"), but when the authorities and state-controlled media criticized them for it, many quickly began backpedaling by claiming they actually chanted "Hoćemo gusle" ("We want the gusle").
Other songs like "Glupi hit" and afore mentioned "Balkan boj" would also become considerable hits and Rambo even received solid critical acclaim for chances he took in "Samit u buregdžinici Laibach". On that track, he created a catchy hybrid by mixing pretentiously heavy sound of Laibach with poetry of Laza Kostić and Desanka Maksimović, as well as with folk "kafana" standard "Čaše lomim" and his own turbo-poetry. Album sleeve lists the lyrics of a song that wasn't actually recorded and explains that "it was dropped at the last moment because there was no room for it" but gives assurances it would appear on the next album. Since the song in question, named "Pegepe ertebe", was all about taking shots at Rambo's label PGP RTB it isn't surprising that it didn't appear on the next, or any subsequent album for that matter.
