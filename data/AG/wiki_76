Harry Brannon

Harry Brannon (June 19, 1920 – December 29, 1991) was an American popular singer born in Gloucester City, New Jersey. Brannon was characterized by his contemporaries as "having a voice sweeter than Bing Crosby's." In fact, in the late 1940s, Brannon was frequently introduced as "Frank Sinatra with a voice" at Andy's Log Cabin near Camden, New Jersey.
Brannon regularly introduced new pop songs in a live format over New York City radio on the WOR Mutual Broadcasting Company broadcast coast to coast. Early in November 1949, Brannon sang "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" over the airwaves for WOR, promoting the Gene Autry classic. By November 25, "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" began its appearance on the music charts. Various popular artists had initially turned down the opportunity to promote the record, including Bing Crosby, due to its slow tempo. However, after hearing the faster and more upbeat Brannon rendition, Crosby sang his own rendition during his CBS Chesterfield radio show on December 14, 1949.
Brannon is known to have recorded at least two songs during his short career in music. Both were released in early 1948. One was titled "Orchids in the Snow", written by composer Edward A. Khoury,and the other was titled "I'm A Tumbleweed", written by Rusty Keefer.
In March, 1954, Bing Crosby, still mourning the recent death of his wife Dixie Lee, was considering retirement. Almost immediately, plans were made by a Hollywood production company to issue a biopic of the famous crooner and approached Brannon (who possessed a similar appearance to Crosby) to play the lead. As Brannon mulled over the offer, he became aware of organized-crime connections to the project. Brannon "dragged his feet" and put it off as long as possible until Crosby, revelling in the success of his recently released film White Christmas, rescinded his retirement plans and the biopic was shelved indefinitely.
Due to a deferred movie career and through the prompting of his wife, Pauline Woolman-Brannon (ex-wife of stuntman Harry Woolman), Brannon left New York City (and the recording industry) in late 1954 and resettled in Gloucester City, New Jersey. Brannon took a management position at a nightclub called Lew Palma's House of Fun on Powell Street. Brannon was a regular performer in it and lived with his family on the second floor.
Through his wife, Brannon soon became affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, presently known as the Community of Christ, and was ordained as a priest by the mid-1960s.
Brannon's adopted son, Harry Gerald Brannon, a Sergeant in the United States Army, died in South Vietnam on August 15, 1966 at age 30. Harry, known as Jerry, was the biological son of stuntman Harry Woolman.
He died of Alzheimer's disease at age 71.

Pelle Pelle

Pelle Pelle is an urban fashion brand designed by Marc Buchanan. Pelle Pelle was launched in 1978 and started as a leather outerwear company. The brand was also the first brand to launch the designer baggy pants. Pelle is based in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
The company was recently asked by some founders of hip-hop, Furious Five and Grandmaster Flash to create a leather jacket for them to wear that was studded when they were inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This brand is also seen in "Notorious", a 2009 motion picture that chronicles the life of rap artist Biggie Smalls.
History.
Pelle Pelle is an urban fashion brand which originated in the 1970s, when the hip-hop era emerged. A revolution in fashion took the form of comfort in baggy pants and loose clothing for emcees and breakdancers. Designer Marc Buchanan specialized in creating brightly colored, highly embellished leather jackets, and branched out to sportswear and other outerwear.
In 2003, Pelle Pelle was fined $40,000 by the Federal Trade Commission for placing inaccurate labels on several types of men's pants and jackets. The clothes were labeled as machine washable; however, the garments were damaged when washed.
Pelle Pelle Product Lines.
In the fall of 2009, Threadless added women’s handbags to their product line:
Leather.
Pelle Pelle leather jackets include a light leather jacket for spring or a heavy one for winter. Most jackets have fur trimmings. Bomber jackets made of leather are available in adult as well as children's sizes.
Outerwear.

Celebrities.
Many celebrities have worn Pelle Pelle, such as 50 Cent, G Unit, Dr. Dre, Young Dre The Truth, Ludacris, NFL Player Marques Colston, Usher, Dru Hill, Bobby Brown, Fat Joe, and more recently Mario.
In the "Cheers" episode "I'm Ok, You're Defective" (air date December 5, 1991), Ted Danson (portraying Sam Malone) prominently wore a Pelle Pelle bomber jacket throughout the latter half of the show.
On January 10, 2009, R&B singer Mario ventured to be the face of Pelle Pelle's European Spring/Summer 2009 campaign with various press shots for the campaign running throughout the next few months.
Gloria Velez appeared in a Pelle Pelle promotion at a Las Vegas event, signing autographs and posing for photographers wearing nothing but Pelle Pelle body paint.
On September 14, 50 Cent wore Pelle Pelle at the final show of Eminem and Jay Z’s “Home & Home Tour” at Yankee Stadium.
In an official Pelle Pelle video (shot by Dukatti Films), Dro Man is shopping for Pelle Pelle and street dancing.

<doc id="20443695" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20443695" title="Hotel Le Plaza, Brussels">
Hotel Le Plaza, Brussels

The Hotel Le Plaza is one of the last independent hotels in Brussels, and also one of the most ancient. He was built in the early thirties in a Louis XVI style, in the heart of Brussels.
History.
Under the reign of King Leopold II, Brussels was equipped with large boulevards and green avenues. Mayor Jules Anspach (1829–1879) contributed to the transformation of the urban landscape of the capital by the realization of the thoroughfare from the North station to the South station.
It is precisely on this thoroughfare that the Hotel Le Plaza was built and opened its doors in 1930. Michel Polak, to whom the architecture was entrusted, found inspiration in the style of the Hôtel George-V in Paris, ensuring by its concrete ossature a remarkable solidity. The frontage was covered with French stones. The interior was designed to reflect the ideas of brightness and splendour: high ceilings, large corridors, big light rooms, several naturally lighted bathrooms, a majestic stairways covering 8 floors, decorated with stained glass windows and fringed with wrought iron hand-rails...
Very soon, prestigious guests came to the Hotel le Plaza, which became one of the symbols of the Brussels luxury hotel trade. In 1940, during the occupation, the hotel was placed under the authority of the German troops just as the great hotels of that time. The military commander for Belgium and the North of France took his quarters there. Premeditating its destruction, the Hotel Le Plaza was, exactly like the Palace of Justice, made into a booby-trap by the Germans, before the arrival of the Allied Forces. Luckily, only its winter garden and its sumptuous stained glass dome were destroyed. Shortly after the liberation, the British general staff occupied in its turn the prestigious palace: Sir Winston Churchill, Joseph Luns, who was secretary general of the NATO from 1971 to 1984, stayed there regularly.
Other important personalities of politics and finance were regular guests of the Hotel Le Plaza. But the hotel was most appreciated by the world of the arts and show business: Charles Aznavour, Jean Marais, Maurice Chevalier, Mistinguett, Louis Jouvet, Michèle Morgan, Gérard Philippe, Annie Cordy, Simone Signoret and Yves Montand, Luis Mariano, Gary Cooper, Raymond Devos, Georges Guétary, Josephine Baker, Fernandel, Lucienne Boyer, Charles Trenet, Martine Carol, Bourvil, Brigitte Bardot, Jean-Claude Pascal, Claudine Dupuis chose it as their favourite hotel in Brussels.
The song Indépendance Cha Cha was played for the first time in the hotel during the negotiations about Congolese independence from Belgium in 1960.
In the early seventies, a true revolution took place in the hotel and leisure world. People had more but shorter stays. The needs of the new travellers changed, stimulating the development of large hotel groups and of the Tour Operating. Moreover, the considerable public works in Brussels upset the economy of the neighbourhood, preventing even the access to the hotel.
The Hotel Le Plaza was obliged, like many of its contemporaries, to close in 1976.
Nowadays.
Twenty years passed before the rebirth of the Hotel le Plaza under the impulse of its present owner, Baron van Gysel de Meise. With a view to give the building its original vocation back, while equipping it with the very latest applications of modern technique, the « Société de Gestion Hôtelière » undertook from February 1995 considerable renovation and fitting works for an investment of 400 million Belgian francs.
By respect for the tradition, the restoration works were placed under the direction of decorator Pierre-Yves Rochon [http://www.pyr-design.com/] – who was in particular in charge of the decoration of the Hotel George-V in Paris, and of Anne van Gysel, in order to recreate in the most faithful way the atmosphere of the past, combining the warmth of a tapestry from the « Manufactures Nationales » of Gobelins, the glossy shine of a rare marble and the diffused light created by chandeliers in amethyst cristal.
Rooms.
The Plaza boasts 190 rooms and suites on 7 floors: 109 Traditional rooms, 53 Deluxe rooms, 20 Prestige rooms, 4 Executive Suites, 1 Plaza Suite and one presidential suite, which is one of the biggest in Benelux. Not a single initial volume was sacrificed, and the rooms (min. 35 m²) and suites with high ceilings are situated along large and spacious corridors.
The theatre.
The Theatre of the Hotel Le Plaza is a former cinema with a surface of , classified as a historical monument by Royal Decree. It was built in 1930, in a unique Spanish – Arab – Moorish style. Under the name of "Acropole Cinema", it opened in 1928 and had an interior designed in a Spanish style with many false windows and barley sugar columns. Seating was provided in stalls and balcony. At one time (possibly in the 1930s) it ran cine-variety shows and the Plaza was equipped with a Wurlitzer theatre organ.
The entrance to the cinema was located at the left-hand side of the twin-blocked building and originally had a large vertical 'PLAZA' sign over the entrance. There was a Plaza Taverne located on the corner of Adolphe Maxlann & Rue de Malines, now the main entrance to hotel. The rear of the building backs onto the former Varieties Theater (Cinerama) around the corner on the narrow Rue de Malines.
The decision was taken during the renovation to keep the original boxes, the genuine bracket-lamps, the stage as well as the richly sculpted wall ornaments of Andalusian inspiration. It is nowadays used as a banquet hall and conference facility.
The restaurant l'Estérel.
This is a Function Room which, between the Versailles and Adolphe Max Rooms, features the particularity of combining the cozy atmosphere of a Bar with the distinction of a Restaurant for 48 guests.

Major League career.
On July 16, 2001, Santana appeared in the only game of his MLB career. He entered the game in the eighth inning as a defensive replacement at second base in place of Damion Easley and second in the batting order. The Tigers, who were losing to the Cincinnati Reds 9-1, batted the number four, five, six, and seven hitters in the top of the ninth inning to close out the game. Santana finished the game without a plate appearance, although he did record a putout of Reds second basemen Juan Castro to close out the eighth inning. This puts Santana in select company with other non-pitchers who appeared in a major league game but did not receive a plate appearance, such as Moonlight Graham. Santana was originally called up on July 13 when the Tigers put starting third baseman Dean Palmer on the disabled list; and was sent back down to the minors when the team activated starting shortstop Deivi Cruz on July 18. 
Santana's brief appearance was notable, as the game took place in July, as opposed to later in the season when rosters expand during September call-ups. Santana was not called up that September.

Connacht Senior League (association football)

Connacht Senior League is a now defunct, amateur football league that ran in the Irish province of Connacht between 1981 and the summer of 2000, being scrapped when the leading clubs opted to join an under 21 league set up that year by the FAI. Teams from this league also competed in Ireland's top cup competitions including the FAI Cup, the FAI Junior Cup and the FAI Intermediate Cup. The champions or highest placed non-reserve team got to take part in the League of Ireland Cup, the reserve sides in question were those of Sligo Rovers, Galway United and occasionally Longford Town. It consisted of one division with some teams merely dropping out (no relegation system existed)and occasionally new ones joining, however with the increasing popularity of Irish soccer in the nineties it slowly attracted more sides, including teams from Leinster, so 2 divisions were eventually created. However this format lasted only one season and it reverted to one division the following season, becoming known as the Connacht Senior League Premiership. Dropouts by some clubs was one reason for this and the trend continued with the league eventually finishing with only eight clubs. Along with the reserves of Sligo Rovers and Galway United League of Ireland First Division sides Mervue United and Salthill Devon were two of the regular competitors while one-time'A Championship side Castlebar Celtic also took part. Other intermediate sides who featured included UCG(later NUIG), Tuam Celtic, Ballinasloe Town, Castlerea Celtic, Straide & Foxford united, Ballina Town, Westport United while clubs from Athlone (Gentex and St.Peters) and Longford also took part. The league is expected to return in the spring of 2014.
EARLIER VARIATIONS OF A CONNACHT LEAGUE PRE 1981
Whilst the Senior league did not commence till 1981, it may be interesting to note there were earlier competitions run by the Conacht FA. There was a competition known as the Western League which a had a stop start history.
Each area (Galway, Sligo, Mayo & Roscommon) had its own qualifyers, wether from a knock-out or round-robin league system. On occasions Mayo & Roscommon competed in the Galway or Sligo heats. 
From research on the Irish Newspaper Archieve details of finals found are as follows.
1936/37 Galway Bohemians 2-1 Sligo St Marys(played Oct 37, heldover from previous season)
1937/38 Galway Bohemians 5-3 Sligo St Marys

Champions.
A. Goal difference did not count so play-offs were needed if teams were level on points.
B. League was split into two groups with the group winners (Straide & Foxford Utd. and Castlebar Celtic) in a play-off final to decide the winners. The top 3 to 4 teams in each group would play in a new premiership the following season and the remaining sides would go into a first division.
C. League consisted of a Premiership and a First Division. It would only be a one off with the league reverting to one division in 1996. Ballinasloe Town were the First Division winners.

Gifted art

Gifted art (or Free art) is any form or piece of art that is given freely, whether to a city, a group of people, a community or an individual. It refers to any art that is distributed at no direct cost. It is a form of conceptual art. It comes from a belief that art should be for available for all people to enjoy, whether rich or poor, university graduate or junior high dropout. Since Gifted Art is an expressive form of art - an idea, it encompasses virtually all forms of art: movies, literature, music recordings, sculpture, painting, graffiti, digital art, street performances, performance art, sticker art, comics, coffeehouse poetry and Internet-distributed art etc.
Short History.
Gifted Art has a long history in the arts. Many artists have been known to give art freely to each other, in an effort to pass along ideas, etc. Picasso and many of his contemporaries were fond of this.
Duchamp was one of the first modern day artists to Gift to the public with his piece, "Fountain", for an art show in 1917. He gave the piece under the name of "R. Mutt," presumably to hide his identity as the artist. He actually had to pay $7 to have the piece exhibited in the show, and never intended on making any money from it. He gave it freely for all to see and to push forward the Dada movement.
In the 50's, Ray Johnson started doing Mail art. He spread the idea to many other artists and it still occurs today. In 2002, a 6 ft X 53 ft mural by Roy Lichtenstein was installed in the Times Square Subway Station in New York City. It was gifted by the artist to all New Yorkers.
In recent years, Gifted Art has primarily been embraced by graffiti and urban artists. Many graffiti artists consider the work they do to be art for the public. Banksy writes in his books that he believes art is more important and more enjoyable when it is out on the street where people can view it in their everyday lives than when it hangs in a museum.

<doc id="20444026" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20444026" title="Erster Theil etlicher Choräle">
Erster Theil etlicher Choräle

Erster Theil etlicher Choräle (commonly known as Acht Choräle zum Präambulieren, PWC 45–52, T. 1–8, PC 1–8) is a collection of liturgical organ music by Johann Pachelbel, published during his lifetime. It contains eight chorale preludes in seven different styles.
General information.
"Erster Theil etlicher Choräle" (literally "First Part of collection of assorted chorales") is one of Pachelbel's earliest publications. It is a mystery, however, when or where it was first published. Johann Mattheson mentions that the first edition appeared before 1693, while the edition lacked any indications of the year of publication. The only copy extant today is a Nuremberg edition by Johann Christoph Weigel, who also published Pachelbel's "Hexachordum Apollinis" (1699) and a reprint of his "Musicalische Ergötzung". This copy is marked "1693", however, there are two problems with this date. The first is that it was added by another hand at a later date, the second is that Weigel did not start working in Nuremberg until at least 1698. Thus, the surviving copy must be a second or a third edition. Given the number of reprints, "Erster Theil" must have enjoyed considerable popularity. The title indicates that Pachelbel may have wished to publish a set of chorale collections, however, no other chorale publications by him are known. 
Johann Christoph Bach (1671–1721), one of Pachelbel's most important pupils, may have assisted with the publication of the first edition of "Erster Theil etlicher Choräle", for the engraving closely resembles his handwriting.
A manuscript collection of chorale preludes by Johann Christoph Bach (1642–1703) may have some connection to Pachelbel's "Erster Theil", given the similarity of not only the subject but also the titles of both collections:
It is not known, however, who influenced whom. No other printed collections of chorale preludes survive from the period, making Pachelbel's "Erster Theil" unique in its choice of subject. Decades after its publication, the collection was singled out by Mattheson, who described the contents as "models chorale writing not to be dismissed" in his "Der vollkommene Capellmeister" (1739).
Contents.
Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ.
This famous chorale is presented as a very straightforward three-voice piece, with the cantus firmus in upper voice and brief snatches of fore-imitation in the lower voices throughout the setting.
Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern.
The chorale "Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern", associated variously with Epiphany (holiday), Whit, Annunciation, and Sundays after Trinity, is set by Pachelbel as a three-voice prelude with the chorale in the bass voice. Pachelbel uses fore-imitation throughout the piece: whenever the next phrase of the chorale is about to begin, the upper voices anticipate its melodic contour in brief imitative passages.
Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren.
The chorale "Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren", an old doxology setting of Psalm 103, is presented by Pachelbel in a three-voice setting with the cantus firmus in the tenor voice. The arrangement of voices and the white mensural notation, both derived from the German polyphonic song, are unique in Pachelbel's surviving oeuvre, as is the ornamentation used in "Wir glauben all an einen Gott".
Vater unser im Himmelreich.
The chorale is a famous hymn associated with the Lord's Prayer. Pachelbel presents it as a four-voice setting with the chorale in the upper voice. Fore-imitation is used throughout the piece in well-developed three-voice sections, resulting in what Pachelbel scholar Kathryn Welter described as "the most magnificent of the eight preludes "Erster Theil" in its discipline of construction and richness of harmonies."
Wir glauben all an einen Gott.
This setting of the German Creed is the only known example of ornamented cantus firmus setting in Pachelbel's surviving works. The style, which goes back to the time of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck and Heinrich Scheidemann, was not wholly unknown to Pachelbel, for he would normally use ornamentation in his chorale variations. A possible explanation is that Pachelbel may have been reluctant to use ornamentation in pieces intended for congregational singing. He probably included the piece in "Erster Theil" as a model. The setting is in three voices, and the ornamented chorale is in the upper voice.
Dies sind dir heil'gen zehn Gebot.
The text of the chorale references the Ten Commandments. Pachelbel's setting (P 50a) is a four-voice fugue in G mixolydian. The first line of the chorale is used as the subject, which appears 11 times. The last statement of the subject is in the lowest voice, establishing with the final notes the pitch the congregation would enter after the piece is performed by the organist. Another setting (P 50b) was formerly attributed to Pachelbel and included in this set. It has since been attributed to Johann Gottfried Walther.
Jesus Christus unser Heiland, der von uns.
This well-known Communion hymn is treated by Pachelbel in a manner most unexpected for the period: the setting is a bicinium, i.e. a two-voice piece with the chorale in long notes in one voice and fast ornamental passages in the other voice. Such pieces were very popular about a hundred years before Pachelbel's time, but by the end of the 17th century they were rarely seen. Pachelbel modifies the old form by splitting the bicinium into two sections: the first has the cantus firmus in the upper voice and the ornaments in the lower voice, while the second (starting at bar 30) reverses this arrangement. Further modification of the classic bicinium form occurs when Pachelbel uses the technique of fore-imitation (for which he was particularly known), when the ornamental passages include motifs that anticipate the chorale melody. The technique is used in many instances throughout the piece, including the very first bars.
Von Himmel hoch, da komm' ich her.
For the last piece of the collection Pachelbel chose Martin Luther's famous Christmas hymn. He sets it as a three-voice piece with the chorale in the bass. Unlike "Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern" which uses the same arrangement, the upper voices do not provide mere fore-imitation, but engage in highly original figurations. Pachelbel scholar Ewald Nolte suggested that these were probably intended as imitations of birdsong, a somewhat popular phenomenon in the instrumental music of the 17th century. In any case, these fanciful figurations, together with the compound 12/8 meter, suggest a pastoral mood.

Midwife Salome

Midwife Salome is a midwife at the Nativity of Jesus who appears in several apocryphal Gospels, and is still depicted with a companion in Eastern Orthodox icons of the scene, though she has long vanished from most Western depictions. A midwife Salome appears in the infancy gospel attached to the name of James the Just, the "Protevangelion of James" (ch. XIV):
14 And the midwife went out from the cave, and Salome met her. 
15 And the midwife said to her, "Salome, Salome, I will tell you a most surprising thing, which I saw. 
16 A virgin has brought forth, which is a thing contrary to nature." 
17 To which Salome replied, "As the Lord my God lives, unless I receive particular proof of this matter, I will not believe that a virgin has brought forth."
18 Then Salome went in, and the midwife said, "Mary, show yourself, for a great controversy has arisen about you." 
19 And Salome tested her with her finger. 
20 But her hand was withered, and she groaned bitterly, 
21 and said, "Woe to me, because of my iniquity! For I have tempted the living God, and my hand is ready to drop off."
That Salome is the first, after the midwife, to bear witness to the birth and to recognize Jesus as the Christ, are circumstances that tend to connect her with Salome the disciple. By the High Middle Ages this Salome was often identified with Mary Salome in the West, and therefore regarded as the believing midwife.

Coupe du Monde de la Boulangerie

The Coupe du Monde de la Boulangerie is an international, invitational artisan baking competition held in Paris, France, every three to four years.
Begun in 1992 by Christian Vabret, president of the Ecole Française de Boulangerie d'Aurillac, to reverse what he considered to be a decline in bread quality, the Coupe du Monde is a competition where bakers who practice the craft of artisan baking compete against teams from other nations, using traditional techniques. The purpose of the competition is to gather artisan bakers from around the world to celebrate their profession, share knowledge of artisan baking techniques, and reinstate the value of the artisan baking profession.
Also known as the World Cup of Baking, the Coupe du Monde de la Boulangerie is held in conjunction with Europain, an international bakery, patisserie, and catering exhibition attracting more than 80,000 visitors. Teams from 12 countries are invited to compete in the Coupe du Monde de la Boulangerie, based upon their rankings in regional competitions. Countries whose teams placed first, second, and third in the previous Coupe du Monde de la Bounlangerie are automatically guaranteed a place in the next Coupe du Monde.
Each team is made up of three members, and each person specializes in one of the major Coupe du Monde categories: Baguettes & Specialty Breads, Artistic Design, and Viennoiserie. Team members must also work together to produce a sandwich presentation for a fourth category, Savory Selection. Teams are evaluated by international judging committees on the basis of individual excellence in artisan baking, as well as on teamwork and time management.

The Irrefutable Truth about Demons is a New Zealand horror film released in 2000. It was directed by Glenn Standring and stars Karl Urban, Katie Wolfe, Jonathon Hendry.
The film is also known as "The Truth About Demons", with the UK DVD release with this title.
Plot.
A haughty anthropology professor named Harry Ballard (Karl Urban) receives a sinister videotape showing a cult called the Black Lodge ranting about some kind of demonic plot. As it turns out, Harry's brother, Richard, killed himself a few months earlier under mysterious circumstances, possibly related to this cult; in any event, the loss has been preying on Harry's mind, sending his relationship with his girlfriend (Sally Stockwell) into a tailspin. Meanwhile a seemingly schizophrenic young woman named Benny (Katie Wolfe), who has a penchant for lighting sparklers in alleyways for no good reason, follows Harry around and snatches him from the jaws of doom after he falls into the cult's hands. The devilish leader, Le Valliant (Jonathan Hendry), apparently has big plans in store for Harry, and soon the protagonist's grip on reality slips as the cult targets him for an upcoming ritual.
Critical reception.
AllMovie gave the film a positive review, calling it "a clever, gleefully ludicrous flick".

The Vector WX8 is a sports car prototype released under development at Vector Motors.

Vector claims the WX8 may achieve a top speed of and a zero-to-60 mph time as low as 2.3 seconds for the version of the car equipped with a 10-litre turbocharged engine. This engine is described variously on the company's website as being capable of "1800+ HP", "1850+ HP", and "over 2000 horsepower".
It was criticized by an automotive journalist and car enthusiasts for its use of Toyota Supra Mark IV headlamps and a front end that resembles the fourth-generation Chevrolet Camaro. The design of the prototype test vehicle though has continued to evolve and seen various changes since.
As of early 2013 Vector has reported little activity in regards to the WX8 project, although they have made no indications as to the WX8 being scrapped or 'shelved'.

Evlogi and Hristo Georgievi Boulevard

Evlogi and Hristo Georgievi Boulevard (, usually referred to simply as "Evlogi Georgiev", which was its name for the entire 20th Century) is an important boulevard in the Bulgarian capital Sofia. It is named after the Bulgarian entrepreneurs Evlogi and Hristo Georgiev. It begins with its intersection with the Cherni Vrah Boulevard and Fridtjof Nansen Street in the area of the National Palace of Culture. To the south of the NPC it is called Bulgaria Boulevard.
Evlogi Georgiev Blvd is crossed by several of the capital's major transport arteries such as the Dragan Tsankov Boulevard and Graf Ignatiev Street (which form one juncture with Evlogi Georgiev) and Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard and Tsarigrad Road at Orlov Most (which also form one juncture).
Along the boulevard are situated the National Stadium Vasil Levski, 120 High School Georgi S. Rakovski, Pope John Paul II Square, Military Academy G. S. Rakovski, Spanish Language School and others.
For its entire length of around 2 km, the boulevard follows the Perlovska river, with its lanes on either side of the artificially-widened riverbed.

MG Car Club

The MG Car Club is an international club founded in 1930 for owners and enthusiasts of MG cars. The club headquarters is based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire and is located adjacent to the now defunct MG factory site where cars were produced between 1930 - 1980. The MG Car Club currently has 35,000 affiliated members Worldwide and in 2010 the organisation celebrated its 80th anniversary.
The MGCC is a not-for-profit organisation.
Founding.
The first club meeting took place on 12 October 1930, at the Roebuck Hotel near Stevenage, with over thirty MG cars and their owners coming together. F.L.M. Harris was General Secretary of the M.G. Car Club and editor of "The Sports Car", which suspended publication at the outbreak of World War II. Earlier he was editor of the "The Light Car" : "Mine was the decision that caused a letter to be published in "The Light Car" suggesting the formation of an M.G. Car Club, and its inaugural meeting at the "Roebuck," Broadwater, was held within a couple of miles of my house." The suggestion came from a Roy Marsh, of Highbury, London.
The company (MG) had adopted a new sales slogan, 'Safety Fast!' late in the 1930s, and two words it seemed to embody the marque's appeal. About the same time a group of enthusiastic owners had formed the M.G Car Club.<br>"F. Wilson McComb - MG"
History.
The first MG Car Club sporting event took place in 1930, the Chilterns Trial. In January 1931, the first club dinner was held with Cecil Kimber as guest speaker; Kimber pledged to donate 50 guineas to club funds. In 1932 the club held the "First Show-Time Dinner-Dance at the Café Royal." Among the guests were Sir William Morris, Earl Howe, Sir Henry Birkin, Mr. G.E.T. Eyston, and Mr. Cecil Kimber. 
As MG production increased, the Club continued to grow and the structure of Regional Centres came into being, extending membership of the club across the UK. A Northern Centre was formed by March 1933, and a Scottish Centre, now the Caledonian Centre, shortly after. By April 1933, the membership had topped 500 and both a Trials team and a Relay Race team had been formed, the latter taking part in the BRDC 500 Miles Race at Brooklands in September 1933, finishing in second place. A bi-monthly magazine, called "M.G. Magazine", made an appearance in May, 1933, edited by Alan C. Hess, Secretary of the M.G. Car Club and former editor of "Motor Sport".
In October 1942 "Motor Sport" announced: "F.L.M. Harris has had to resign his hon. secretaryship of the M.G. Car Club, a position he has fulfilled so extremely successfully for the past eight years, on account of increasingly heavy R.A.F. commitments." In 1945, the club was taken in-house by the MG Car Co. at Abingdon. Petrol was strictly rationed, so club motorsport was more or less non-existent. August 1951 saw the first Silverstone ‘all-Centre’ meeting, an event which still continues today. Membership continued to grow and the first overseas Centres were formed. The club was greatly strengthened by the initiation of a magazine circulated to all members, "Safety Fast", compiled by F. Wilson McComb.
During the period 1960-1967 the South East Centre organised competitive events at the Firle Hill Climb in Sussex.
In the 1960s, there was a growth in Overseas membership. In 1966 "The Motor" reported: "The MG Car Club recently enrolled its 5,000th home member. Which, with some 4,000 overseas members, gives the club a total strength of more than 9,000 souls." As the decade drew to a close though, the relationship with the parent company—first BMC and then British Leyland—lost the closeness which had previously existed with MG. The club faced an uncertain future but Gordon Cobban, then Chairman of the South East Centre, and others worked hard to not only plan a safe financial basis for continuing but to license the club name (and that of "Safety Fast") from BL. Support from UK and Overseas Centres for the new structure was vital, so in October 1969 a fully independent MG Car Club was formed, providing a basis for the club which continues today. Initially the club moved into rented offices in Abingdon but quickly became somewhat nomadic being based in Boston, Studley and Radley.
In 1979 "The Guardian" reported: "The MG Car Club has nine centres in the UK, and another 30 in America. The Danish club centre has just celebrated its 25th birthday, and the German centre was able to turn out 300 MGs for an event at Hausach.
The goal of the club was always to return the headquarters to Abingdon, the home of MG. In April 1988 a Building Appeal Fund was set up in order to raise money for the acquisition of a home for the club. By mid-1989, this resulted, thanks to the generosity of many club members and other benefactors, in the purchase of 11 & 12 Cemetery Road, a detached property right next to the original gate of the MG factory. Many donations in cash and in kind were vital to the renovation of the premises as suitable offices for the club, completed in 1990. The premises are now held for the use of the club by the Douglas Mickel Trust, named after Douglas Mickel OBE, the largest of the benefactors involved. The office is known as Kimber House in tribute to Cecil Kimber, the founder of the MG Car Company.
In 1995, the MGF was launched at the Geneva Motor Show, and a convoy of historic MG cars from the MG Car Club drove from Abingdon to Geneva to mark the occasion. The car quickly became the fastest selling sports car on the UK market. Thanks to a close link to the MG/Rover division of BMW through a director of the club, the club gained a whole new group of members as the MGF Register was formed. As part of this closer relationship with the manufacturer once more, the club also took on the running of the Abingdon Trophy, a speed and race championship for MGF Trophy specification cars which proved to be very popular, introducing a whole new racing car to club racing in the UK. In 2001 this relationship strengthened as the Club picked up the high-profile MGF Cup race Championship, later again adding a fleet of MG ZRs built by MG Sport & Racing. These cars now race in a championship called the Mg Trophy Championship. This championship now features the MG TF LE 500 along with road worthy MG ZR s and MGF MG TF.
Structure.
The MG Car Club is divided into registers, centres and branches. Registers are responsible for looking after different models of MG cars. The fourteen centres organise local events in different regions of the UK. Branches organise race championship series and track days. The club's head office is based in Abingdon, where seven full-time staff are based. MG Car Club directors are volunteers.

ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division

The ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division (colloquially, "ASPCA Law Enforcement") was the law enforcement arm of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) from 1866 until 2013, when the law enforcement division was disbanded. The agency enforced animal related laws, and investigated cases of animal cruelty.
Agency History.
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was incorporated in 1866 by a special state legislation to prevent animal cruelty through various programs including animal adoption services, animal education programs and an armed law enforcement division.
The Humane Law Enforcement Division was a branch of the ASPCA staffed by 20 armed New York State peace officers who responded to reports of animal cruelty in marked ASPCA patrol cars in the New York City area as well as perform undercover operations. The officers were empowered through NYS Criminal Procedure Law and NY Agriculture and Markets laws to investigate allegations of animal abuse, seize animals being abused, and make arrests for the prosecution for animal cruelty.
In 2000, the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division received 33,000 calls for service which resulted in 55 arrests, 30 summons being issued, and 537 animal seizures.
Disbandment of the Law Enforcement Division.
In December 2013, the President of the ASPCA stated that the Law Enforcement Division would be getting disbanded and the enforcement of humane laws and response to calls for animal abuse/cruelty would be the responsibility of the NYPD. By early January 2014, most of the officers of the division had been terminated. The reason given for the disbandment was that the NYPD was better equipped and had more manpower to handle enforcement of humane laws and to respond to calls for animal abuse/cruelty. Response to the disbandment has been mixed, with some saying the NYPD can do a better job while others say the NYPD has other more priority situations to handle and the response to animal abuse/cruelty will be slow.
Crime Scene Investigation.
In 2007, the ASPCA created an animal cruelty crime scene investigation unit. The CSI unit uses a Ford E-450 vehicle equipped with a surgery area for injured animals, evidence processing, documentation, and storage equipment. The van is staffed with a forensic veterinarian to help document evidence to aid in the prosecution of perpetrators. Although the vehicle is used primarily in New York City, it can be deployed to any area of the United States at the request of a law enforcement agency. The Crime Scene Investigation unit will not be affected by the disbandment of the Law Enforcement Division and will remain active.
Law Enforcement Training.
ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement officers received peace officer training in addition to investigator training and firearms training. In 1999, ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement recruits began attending a specialized investigator training course through the New York City Police academy.
Equipment.
ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement officers were equipped with either a Glock 19 9mm or a Smith and Wesson 5906 9mm handgun, pepper spray, ASP baton, and handcuffs.
Their squad cars were primarily Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors, in addition to vans, and SUVs.
They carried poles and cages for seizures and catches.
Rank Structure & Title.
There were five titles (referred to as ranks) in the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division:

Anglia Square Shopping Centre, Norwich

The Anglia Square shopping centre is located to the north of Norwich city centre. It is bounded by the historic Magdalen and St Augustine's streets.
History.
Built in the 1960s and 70s in an area that had been heavily bombed in the Baedeker raids during World War II, the centre was designed by Allan Cooke & Partners who handled the whole development.
Description of centre.
Pedestrian shop-lined walkways lead onto the main square which was originally open to the elements but now covered by a steel and glass structure - added in the late 20th century. The red brick and concrete buildings are finished in the brutalist style. Forming the western boundary of the centre is the former HMSO building Sovereign House the building, now empty and due for demolition. Built on a concrete raft and rising above the centre is the c.1971 former Odeon cinema, now part of the Hollywood chain.
Shops.
The single storey shops include discount supermarkets and a wide range of privately owned and high street stores. The covered square features a selection of street stalls.
Regeneration.
Anglia Square and the surrounding area is to be the centre of a major redevelopment with a suggested name of Calvert Square (Calvert Street is nearby). During 2008 the public were invited to view the proposals. Work was due to start in 2009 but plans were scaled down due to the credit crunch. In January 2011 new plans for the square were lodged and the developers hope to gain approval before the end of April 2011. In November, 2009 the public were asked to have their say on the proposed development. The multi-million pound plans are to be part of the Northern City Centre Area Action Plan.

Les Chats Sauvages

Les Chats Sauvages (The Wild Cats) was a French rock and roll band, that was formed in 1961. Together with Les Chaussettes Noires, they were among the first outfits to perform rock and roll music in France.
Career.
Les Chats Sauvages was originally composed of Dick Rivers (Hervé Forneri) on vocals, John Rob (Jean-Claude Roboly) on guitar, James Fawler (Gérard Roboly) on guitar, Jack Regard (Gérard Jaquemus) on bass, and Willy Lewis (Wiliam Taïeb) on drums. The later was successively replaced by Armand Molinetti, Dean Shelton and Andre Ceccarelli. 
In February 1961, the British music magazine, "NME", reported that their concert at the Palais des Sports de Paris, whilst headlining with Vince Taylor, had turned ito a full-scale riot.
The departure of Rivers in the summer of 1962, who was replaced by Mike Shannon, affected the band's popularity, which nevertheless continued its career. They charted with the song "Derniers baisers", covered with success by C. Jérôme in 1986 and Laurent Voulzy in 2006.
In 1963, Jean Claude visited in New York with the group's American manager, Andre M. Lauffer, a New York attorney,for the purpose of "making the rounds" of the popular TV shows. They met with The Ed Sullivan Show producers and were promised consideration for a future appearance. Unfortunately, the laws for overseas entertainers were very restrictive and the group could not meet the requirements in effect at that time.
Les Chats Sauvages broke up in 1964, before briefly reappearing twice, including an album release in 1982 with Dick Rivers, to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of their formation.

Loob

In Philippine Culture, Loob or Kalooban refers to one's inner self, or, more specifically, to the internal dimension of a person's identity. It's external counterpart is "labas" - the physical, outward appearance. Loob is a core concept in Filipino Psychology, a field which is unthinkable without both the internal and external dimensions, ""loob""/""labas"".
Loob or kalooban has been compared to similar concepts in other Southeast Asian and Oceanian cultures, such as the Indonesian concept of "batin" or "kebatinan".
Concepts whose expression involves "loob".
The word "Loob", simply taken as 'inside' and not a construct, is also used for ""looban"," which means an interior compound, or community; and for the term ""manloloob"", which means 'robber', literally 'someone who enters'.
As a core concept of value, "Loob" and its variants are a critical aspect of numerous Filipino value constructs, of which the following are examples:

<doc id="20444608" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20444608" title="Storage area network">
Storage area network

A storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to enhance storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium sized business environments.
A SAN does not provide file abstraction, only block-level operations. However, file systems built on top of SANs do provide file-level access, and are known as "SAN filesystems" or shared disk file systems.
Storage.
Historically, data centers first created "islands" of SCSI disk arrays as direct-attached storage (DAS), each dedicated to an application, and visible as a number of "virtual hard drives" (i.e. LUNs). Essentially, a SAN consolidates such storage islands together using a high-speed network.
Operating systems maintain their own file systems on their own dedicated, non-shared LUNs, as though they were local to themselves. If multiple systems were simply to attempt to share a LUN, these would interfere with each other and quickly corrupt the data. Any planned sharing of data on different computers within a LUN requires advanced solutions, such as SAN file systems or clustered computing.
Despite such issues, SANs help to increase storage capacity utilization, since multiple servers consolidate their private storage space onto the disk arrays.
Common uses of a SAN include provision of transactionally accessed data that require high-speed block-level access to the hard drives such as email servers, databases, and high usage file servers.
SAN and NAS.
NAS, Network Attached Storage was a solution to the problems of Direct Attached Storage (DAS). The solution was that servers would share a connection to the storage devices via a network connection through the LAN. This set up allows the server to be used loaded with software and applications instead of being split between two duties. With the old DAS setup the server would be split between application use and storage use. With NAS there is no longer a need for support of the traditional storage interface (SCSI) and now the server or client may access NAS storage with a network connection. The drawback to this is that there is no longer a high-speed connection between the CPU and storage units – they still must use the LAN to communicate and this creates bandwidth bottlenecks. In addition requests are processed using file access protocols and CPU cycles must be used to convert into block requests that a server may use to retrieve files and information. This has relegated NAS to be used as data backup more than anything else .
SAN-NAS hybrid.
Despite the differences between SAN and NAS, it is possible to create solutions that include both technologies.
Benefits.
Sharing storage usually simplifies storage administration and adds flexibility since cables and storage devices do not have to be physically moved to shift storage from one server to another.
Other benefits include the ability to allow servers to boot from the SAN itself. This allows for a quick and easy replacement of faulty servers since the SAN can be reconfigured so that a replacement server can use the LUN of the faulty server. While this area of technology is still new, many view it as being the future of the enterprise datacenter.
SANs also tend to enable more effective disaster recovery processes. A SAN could span a distant location containing a secondary storage array. This enables storage replication either implemented by disk array controllers, by server software, or by specialized SAN devices. Since IP WANs are often the least costly method of long-distance transport, the Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP) and iSCSI protocols have been developed to allow SAN extension over IP networks. The traditional physical SCSI layer could only support a few meters of distance - not nearly enough to ensure business continuance in a disaster.
The economic consolidation of disk arrays has accelerated the advancement of several features including I/O caching, snapshotting, and volume cloning (Business Continuance Volumes or BCVs).
Network types.
Most storage networks use the SCSI protocol for communication between servers and disk drive devices. A mapping layer to other protocols is used to form a network:
Storage networks may also be built using SAS and SATA technologies. SAS evolved from SCSI direct-attached storage. SATA evolved from IDE direct-attached storage. SAS and SATA devices can be networked using SAS Expanders.
SAN infrastructure.
SANs often use a Fibre Channel fabric topology - an infrastructure specially designed to handle storage communications. It provides faster and more reliable access than higher-level protocols used in NAS. A fabric is similar in concept to a network segment in a local area network. A typical Fibre Channel SAN fabric is made up of a number of Fibre Channel switches.
Today, all major SAN equipment vendors also offer some form of Fibre Channel routing solution, and these bring substantial scalability benefits to the SAN architecture by allowing data to cross between different fabrics without merging them. These offerings use proprietary protocol elements, and the top-level architectures being promoted are radically different.
They often enable mapping Fibre Channel traffic over IP or over SONET/SDH.
Compatibility.
One of the early problems with Fibre Channel SANs was that the switches and other hardware from different manufacturers were not compatible. Although the basic storage protocols FCP were always quite standard, some of the higher-level functions did not interoperate well. Similarly, many host operating systems would react badly to other operating systems sharing the same fabric. Many solutions were pushed to the market before standards were finalized and vendors have since innovated around the standards.
SANs in media and entertainment.
Video editing workgroups require very high data transfer rates and very low latency. Outside of the enterprise market, this is one area that greatly benefits from SANs.
SANs in Media and Entertainment are often referred to as Serverless SANs due to the nature of the configuration which places the video workflow (ingest, editing, playout) clients directly on the SAN rather than attaching to servers. Control of data flow is managed by a distributed file system such as StorNext by Quantum.
Per-node bandwidth usage control, sometimes referred to as Quality of Service (QoS), is especially important in video workgroups as it ensures fair and prioritized bandwidth usage across the network, if there is insufficient open bandwidth available.
Storage virtualization.
Storage virtualization is the process of abstracting logical storage from physical storage. The physical storage resources are aggregated into storage pools, from which the logical storage is created. It presents to the user a logical space for data storage and transparently handles the process of mapping it to the physical location, a concept called location transparency. This is implemented in modern disk arrays, often using vendor proprietary solutions. However, the goal of storage virtualization is to group multiple disk arrays from different vendors, scattered over a network, into a single storage device. The single storage device can then be managed uniformly. 
SAN Storage QoS (Quality of Service).
SAN Storage QoS (Quality of Service) is the coordination of capacity and performance in a dedicated storage area network. This enables the desired storage performance to be calculated and maintained for network customers accessing the device.
Key factors that affect Storage Area Network QoS(Quality of Service) are:
QoS can be impacted in a SAN storage system by unexpected increase in data traffic (usage spike) from one network user that can cause performance to decrease for other users on the same network. This can be known as the “Noisy Neighbor Effect.” When QoS services are enabled in a SAN storage system, the “Noisy Neighbor Effect” can be prevented and network storage performance can be accurately predicted.
Using SAN storage QoS is in contrast to using disk over-provisioning in a SAN environment. Over-provisioning can be used to provide additional capacity to compensate for peak network traffic loads. However, where network loads are not predictable, over-provisioning can eventually cause all bandwidth to be fully consumed and latency to increase significantly resulting in SAN performance degradation.

<doc id="20444643" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20444643" title="Bread Project">
Bread Project

The Bread Project is a 501(c)(3) public benefit corporation located in San Francisco Bay Area with facilities in Emeryville and Berkeley. Its mission is to empower individuals with limited resources on their path to self-sufficiency through skills instruction, on-the-job training in our social enterprises and assistance with establishing a career in the food industry. Its model consists of a rigorous culinary/bakery training program, extensive workplace readiness coaching, on-the-job experience, employer outreach for job placement, and long-term follow-up support.
History.
The Bread Project was co-founded in 2001 by homeless advocate Lucie Buchbinder, a Holocaust survivor originally from Vienna, Austria who immigrated to the US in 1938, and Susan Phillips, a social worker from San Francisco. They received initial support from the San Francisco Baking Institute, which agreed to provide training and equipment at cost. Both had managed public housing and other low-income housing projects and saw the need to train residents for more steady jobs, which they felt would be available in the San Francisco Bay Area's growing bakery industry. Buchbinder and Phillips retired from active management in 2005. Buchbinder died in 2007 in a train accident at Jack London Square in Oakland.
Training Programs.
Curriculum.
The Bread Project's training program has two main strands: a 12-week Bakery Production course, which prepares trainees for large-scale baked goods production, and a 9-week Food Service program, which prepares trainees for culinary and customer service jobs in cafes, caterers, and restaurants. Both consist of 315 hours of technical training provided by experienced chefs in real industrial kitchens. Trainees also receive 45 hours of job readiness training, addressing positive workplace skills such as professionalism, motivation, presentation, and attitude. We explain, practice, and observe these skills in action to ensure that graduates are able to successfully get and retain jobs. 
Food Service classes take place at the Berkeley Unified School District's Berkeley Adult School, and Bakery Production classes happen at the former Semifreddi's Bakery location in Emeryville, California.
Partnerships and Placement Support.
The Bread Project works closely with local food employers to identify the skills they expect, and adjusts curricula accordingly. These relationships are also used to find opportunities for graduates and directly place them into jobs whenever possible. A 3-month intensive job development period is activated upon program graduation, where graduates are engaged via an incentive reporting and mentorship program to provide ongoing support and coaching. This also enables the acquisition of outcome data to evaluate and improve our performance.
Social Enterprises.
The Bread Project operates multiple social enterprises to ensure financial sustainability, create jobs, and provide on-the-job experience for trainees. All social enterprises are staffed and partially managed by former trainees.
Copacking.
The Bread Project operates a copacking business, where it manufactures and packages food products for partners.
Consulting.
Experts in food science, packaging, and food costing are available to assist food entrepreneurs in refining their products.
Catering.
Breads, pastries, sandwiches, appetizers, and salads are all available for catering.
Wholesale Production.
The Bread Project maintains standing contracts with local school districts to provide muffins and breads to local students.
Packaged Goods.
In 2012, a line of packaged luxury food items was developed that will be sold through national retailers, beginning in February 2013.
Cafe.
In the Berkeley Adult School, part of the Berkeley Unified School District, the Bread Project operates a small cafe.
Population Served.
The Bread Project is designed to help low-income individuals struggling with long-term unemployment due to incarceration, addiction, homelessness, and other barriers to work. In 2011-2012, 74% of trainees relied on public benefits or had no income, and 87% were at the poverty income level. Average length of unemployment was 20.4 months. 
Many struggled with substance abuse (12%), and nearly half had some type of physical or mental disability. At least 30% of trainees have had contact with the criminal justice system. Women account for more than half of trainees, and over 18% were female heads of household. More than 86% identified with minority racial/ethnic groups. 
The majority of trainees come from Oakland, Berkeley, and Richmond. About 65% lack independent housing, being dependent on public housing, friends, family, shelters, or transitional lodging.

<doc id="20444659" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20444659" title="Bahá'í Faith in Jamaica">
Bahá'í Faith in Jamaica

The Bahá'í Faith in Jamaica begins with a mention by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, in 1916 as Latin America being among the places Bahá'ís should take the religion to. The community of the Bahá'ís begins in 1942 with the arrival of Dr. Malcolm King. The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Jamaica, in Kingston, was elected in 1943. By 1957 the Bahá'ís of Jamaica were organized under the regional National Spiritual Assembly of the Greater Antilles, and on the eve of national independence in 1962, the Jamaica Bahá'ís elected their own National Spiritual Assembly in 1961. By 1981 hundreds of Bahá'ís and hundreds more non-Bahá'ís turned out for weekend meetings when Rúhíyyih Khánum spent six days in Jamaica. Public recognition of the religion came in the form of the Governor General of Jamaica, Sir Howard Cooke, proclaiming a National Bahá'í Day first on July 25 in 2003 and it's been an annual event since. While there is evidence of several active communities by 2008 in Jamaica, estimates of the Bahá'ís population range from the hundreds to the thousands.
Early phase.
`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unveiling in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.
His Christ Holiness says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.…(travel to) the Islands of the West Indies, such as Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Islands of the Lesser Antilles, Bahama Islands, even the small Watling Island, have great importance…
Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades.
Shoghi Effendi wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bahá'í Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote:
Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in "Tablets of the Divine Plan". Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.
Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the "First Seven Year Plan" (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America.
Establishment.
After a brief visit in 1939 by John and Rosa Shaw from San Francisco, the community of the Bahá'í Faith in Jamaica begins in 1942 with the arrival of Dr. Malcolm King - from Portland, Oregon, United States and of Jamaican background. King taught the religion to Marion Maxwell, the first Jamaican Bahá'í and William Mitchell (previously accountant for the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA) founded by Marcus Garvey). The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Jamaica, in Kingston, was elected in 1943. Mitchell was the Jamaican delegate to the Bahá'í All-America Convention called for by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, to be held in the United States May 17–24, 1944 on the centenary of the declaration of the Báb. Mitchell in turn taught the religion to Julius Edwards, associated with Garvey and later pioneered to the area now called Ghana in 1953 and later in Liberia. There was also Eustace Whyte among the early Bahá'ís of Jamaica who served as president of UNIA's Harmony Division in Kingston as well as elected to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Kingston. Garvey scholar Robert Hill gave a eulogy at one of Whyte's funeral services.
Growth.
In 1963 the Bahá'ís of the world looked to the election of the Universal House of Justice as the new head of the religion. The electors were the members of the national assemblies then in existence. The members of the Jamaican National Assembly who participated in the election were Miss Doris Maud Buchanan, Mr. Randolph Fitz-Henley, Miss Alice Maude Gallier, Mr. Wm. Arthur Wellesley Mitchell, Mr. Alfred Senior, Miss Emily Taylor, Miss Ruby Taylor, Mr. Clarence Ullrich, Mrs. Margarite Ullrich. Later the Universal House of Justice called for eight Oceanic and Continental Conferences and one was held in Kingston for the Caribbean region in May 1971. In 1981, just before the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Bahá'í community in Jamaica, Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khánum traveled throughout the Caribbean region and spent six days in Jamaica. She was received by the Governor General and Prime Minister while over two hundred Bahá'ís attended a weekend conference and more non-Bahá'ís attended a public meeting. A twenty minute television interview as well as general coverage by radio and television reporters highlighted her visit.
Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1985 the Bahá'í International Community canvassed the National Assemblies with a questionnaire - 77 of the 143 then existing assemblies responded. Jamaican responses highlighted a sense that women in Jamaica were taking on leadership positions on local assemblies. Former assistant to the dean of the school of engineering and applied science at Washington University in St. Louis, Naomi McCord, and her husband served as caretakers of the National Bahá'í Center in Kingston for a number of years. McCord willed more than 200 volumes from her personal library to the center.
In a first step in relation to the general Jamaican community, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Jamaica was a founding member of the Jamaican Interfaith Council in 1992.
Modern community.
The Bahá'ís have participated in a number of activities of wider and local relevance to Jamaicans. In 2000 Bahá'ís joined in observing the International Day of Peace with prayers called for by the Millennium World Peace Summit of religious leaders which met at the United Nations during August 28–31, and in 2002 Bahá'ís participated in a national dialogue on transcending tribalistic boundaries present in politics. Governor General of Jamaica, Sir Howard Cooke, proclaimed a National Bahá'í Day first on July 25 in 2003 and it's been an annual event since. Among the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the first Jamaican local spiritual assembly after two weeks of events was a blood drive organized by the Bahá'ís of Kingston. The festivities were also attended by retired Continental Counselor Ruth Pringle just two weeks before her death. In 2006 the Bahá'ís of Port Antonio held a 4 day exhibition at the public library on the history of the Faith in Jamaica with the Bahá'í Day observance. The Bahá'í Centre in Kingston has hosted Sir Howard Cooke's Thursday Group which has continued to operate since Sir Cooke's retirement in 2006. In 2008 Bahá'í Dorothy Whyte was named the new executive director at the Women's Resource and Outreach Centre in Kingston. In 2005 the international Bahá'í choir, Voices of Bahá, performed in Jamaica as part of their first tour in the Caribbean and performed at Ward Theatre and the University's Chapel with proceeds earmarked to two Jamaican charities serving families of policemen slain in the line of duty and the Denham Town Golden Age Home.
Demographics.
In 2000 local sources reported 4,000 Bahá'ís in Jamaica, notably in cities like Montego Bay, Port Antonio, Ocho Rios and May Pen though recent international sources reported anywhere from 279 Bahá'ís to more than 8,000. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 5137 Bahá'ís in 2005. In 2006 there were 21 local spiritual assemblies. In 2008, Bahá'í community events are listed especially in Montego Bay, Morant Bay, Port Morant, and the Kingston/St. Andrew Parish area.

<doc id="20444709" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20444709" title="International Forestry Students' Association">
International Forestry Students' Association

International Forestry Students’ Association or IFSA is a non-political, not for profit organisation of tertiary-level forestry students around the world.
Approximately 10,000 forestry and related forest science students are either directly or indirectly represented, with more than 60 Local Committees in over 40 countries.
IFSA promotes global cooperation among students of forest sciences in order to broaden knowledge and understanding to achieve a sustainable future for forests, and provides a voice for youth in international forest policy processes. For this, IFSA provides a platform for students of forest sciences to enrich their formal education, promote cultural understanding by encouraging collaboration with international partner organisations and to gain practical experiences with a wider and more global perspective. Through its social network, IFSA encourages student meetings, enables participation in scientific debates, and supports the involvement of youth in decision making processes and international forest and environmental policy.
IFSA is officially registered as a charity organisation, with its seat in Freiburg, Germany.
Activities.
Youth representative during international decision making processes regarding environmental and forest policy.
As a Youth Non-Governmental Organization (YNGO), IFSA has the status of youth representative for the following events:
The organisation promotes the involvement of professional foresters in decision making. In the organisation's opinion, forest scientists are, as a matter of principle, better qualified to evaluate questions of sustainable forest management than specialists from other sciences. For that reason, forestry students are offered the opportunity to understand and actively take part in these international forest policy processes.
Currently, IFSA is preparing to organise a session at the 2009 World Forestry Congress in Argentina.
Commissions.
IFSA has various working groups (commissions) which allow students the chance to develop new skills, contribute to the running of the organisation and work to achieve the aims of IFSA.
The "International Processes Commission (IPC)" coordinates and prepares the participation of IFSA in the policy processes outlined above. It is also a forum to discuss differing points of view forest policy. The "Exchange Program Commission (EP)" facilitates student work placements and exchanges between forestry companies, NGOs, research institutions and universities around the world. The "Promotion and Publication Commission (P&P)" is in charge of the publication of the IFSA News, IFSA's official newsletter. P&P also develops other promotional material for the association such as posters and brochures. The "Web Commission" is in charge of the maintenance and development of the IFSA website and the online forum. The "Language Commission" is responsible for the translation of official documents from various languages into English and vice versa. Formerly the "Village Concept Program", the "Development Program" has the aim of creating programs whereby students can dedicate their time to assist with the ecologically sustainable development of less economically developed countries. The "Fundraising Commission" is responsible for raising money for running the association and its activities, as well as providing fundraising packages and advice for members to travel to IFSA events.
International Forestry Students’ Meetings.
The International Forestry Students’ Association forms a wide network of forestry students throughout the world, on which the Association bases its main activities — meetings of students at the regional and international levels. These meetings allow better communication between members and facilitate cultural exchange and the making of new friendships.
Hosted by a different country each year, the "International Forestry Students’ Symposium" (IFSS) is the venue for the IFSA General Assembly, during which work from the previous year is reported, decisions are made regarding IFSA activities and new officials for the next year are elected and appointed. During the IFSS, numerous activities are planned to showcase the host country's culture and natural environment, in particular the forests. Lectures from guest speakers and field trips attempt to make the IFSS educational as well as fun.
IFSA also holds very important regional meetings, such as the South European Regional Meeting (SERM), North European Regional Meeting (NERM), and Latin American Regional Meeting (LARM). These meetings are the opportunity to discuss the problems in a geographical area. IFSA also tries to help to develop regional meetings in Africa, Asia and North America.
The interim meeting is attended by IFSA Officials and is held midway through the IFSA year. It allows officials to discuss their progress and whether they are meeting their aims set at the IFSS, discuss any problematic situations and work together to learn from each other and improve the work being carried out. IFSA 7 is attended by the Direction and Council, the main aim of preparing for the General Assembly at the IFSS.
Partnerships with professional organizations.
IFSA has very strong partnerships with the International Union of Forest Research organizations (IUFRO) and the European Forest Institute (EFI), which permit student to join international scientific congresses, to have the opportunity to present their work during them and to meet some specialist in the different fields of forestry. Between 2005 and 2006, EFI and IFSA cooperated in the framework of the FOPER programme (Forest Policy and Economics Education and Research)
IFSA has also recent partnership with the Commonwealth Forestry Association (CFA) which always offers new opportunities. Finally, IFSA is member of the International Partnership for Forestry Education (IPFE) and helps actively to improve the forestry education around the world. Such partnerships are very important in the preparation of students for their professional life.
Organisation.
The main team responsible for running IFSA is known as the IFSA 7. This consists of the President, Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary, and a three person Council. Below these positions are the Heads and Sub-Heads of the Commissions and Regional Representatives. Members fall within one of eight regions, defined by geographical area. These regions are Asia, Northern America, Latin America, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Northern Africa, Southern Africa and Oceania.
History.
The first annual meeting of forestry students, the International Forestry Students Symposium was held in London in 1973. The aim was to provide forestry students the opportunity to meet their counterparts from other countries, discuss ideas and views and create an atmosphere of solidarity and inspiration.
The first accomplishment of these meetings was the creation of INFOCENTER; an office established to co-ordinate the exchange of information among forestry students. During the 18th IFSS in Lisbon, Portugal in 1988, the participants decided to expand the co-operation between forestry students beyond the annual symposium. At the constitutional assembly of IFSA, the founding member associations approved provisional statutes and elected the first representative organs. INFOCENTER was relocated and took on the official role as IFSA's communicative and informational organ. The following year, the 19th IFSS was organised in the Netherlands. This symposium turned out to be a great success with 112 participants from 38 countries; it was the first time that students from all continents were represented. The following symposium was organised in Italy (1992). Here the third General Assembly (GA) designated a central organ, the Secretariat, to be responsible for the association's bureaucratic tasks, internal communications and all INFOCENTER duties. The Secretariat, thus, fully assumed its role as IFSA headquarters.
IFSA became a truly worldwide organisation when the new statutes were finally approved in 1994 at the fifth GA during the 22nd IFSS in Switzerland. The association was officially registered as a charity organisation with its seat in Göttingen, Germany. Five years later, with the adoption of the revised Statutes, Decrees and By-laws, the general assembly moved the seat to Freiburg, Germany.

Carham

Carham is a village in Northumberland, England. The village lies on the south side of the River Tweed about west of Coldstream. 
History.
Near to Carham are the extensive remains of Early British camps and a bronze sword, now in the British Museum, discovered in the nearby Tweed.
Carham on the Tweed, where a stream divides Northumberland from Scotland, was the scene of two battles in Anglo-Saxon times.
In 833 the Danes fought the English, and the English were routed. Leland tells us that
in the 33rd year of Ecbright the Danes arrived at Lindisfarne and fought with the English at Carham where Eleven Bishops and two English Countes were slayne, and a great numbre of people.
A field between the glebe and Dunstan Wood, where bones have been from time to time disinterred, is probably the site of the battle.
In 1016 or 1018 the Battle of Carham between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Northumbrians resulted in a Scottish victory.
Governance.
Carham is in the parliamentary constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed.
Religious sites.
The church is dedicated to St Cuthbert.

539th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron

The 539th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last assignment was with the New York Air Defense Sector, stationed at McGuire AFB, New Jersey. It was inactivated on 31 August 1967.
History.
The 539th Fighter Squadron was activated in October 1943 at Westover Field, Chicopee, Mass in October 1943. Shortly after activation, the squadron moved to Seymour Johnson Field, Goldsboro, North Carolina to become part of the 402nd Fighter Group where it operated under the Replacement Training Unit Program of the advanced phase of pilot training. In December 1943, the squadron again moved, this time to Blumenthal Field, Wilmington, North Carolina, and was assigned to the 326th Fighter Group where it remained until disbanded in April 1944. 
Reactivated as part of the United States Air Force Air Defense Command in January 1955 it received F-86D's and in August 1955 the unit designation was transferred to McGuire AFB as the 539th Fighter Interceptor Squadron where it received F-86L's. In May 1959 the squadron transitioned to F-106A becoming the first squadron in the United States Air Force to be equipped with the F-106's. 
The 539th was inactivated 31 Aug 1967 as part of the phasedown of the ADC interceptor force.

Les Chaussettes Noires

Les Chaussettes Noires () were a French rock and roll band founded in 1960, that was among the pioneer of rock music in France, together with Les Chats sauvages.
It was originally composed of Claude Moine, aka Eddy Mitchell (vocals), William Benaïm (guitar solo), Tony D'Arpa (rhythm guitar), Aldo Martinez (bass guitar), and Jean-Pierre Chichportich (drums)
Les Chaussettes Noires signed in late 1960 with Barclay Records, under which the band recorded a score of successful gramophone records, including: "Be-Bop-A-Lula" (1960), "Tu parles trop" (1960), "Daniela" (1961)—which remains their biggest hit—, "Eddie'm good" (1961)—a French adaptation of Chuck Berry's 1958 song "Johnny B. Goode"—, "Hey Pony" (1961), "Madame Madam" (1961), "Dactylo rock" (1961), "La leçon de twist" (1962), "Le twist du canotier" (1962) with Maurice Chevalier, and "Parce que tu sais".
The band declined from 1962 with the departure of Mitchell for his military service. He would then start a solo career in 1963. The group stopped recording in late 1964.
As a result of replacement or integration, the following musicians were also part of the band: Michel Santangel (drums), Arturo Motta (drums), Armand Molinette (drums), Gilbert Bastelica (drums), Michel Gaucher (saxophone), Michel Picard (saxophone), and Paul Benaïm (rhythm guitar).

Longhorsley

Longhorsley is a village in Northumberland, England about northwest of Morpeth, and about south of Alnwick. The A697 road passes through the village linking it with Morpeth, Wooler and Coldstream in Scotland. There are 7 "Streets" in Longhorsley: Whitegates, Church View, Drummonds Close, South Road, West Road, East Road and Reivers Gate. The village is bordered on the north by the River Coquet. The village formerly lay in three separate townships: Bigges Quarter, Freeholders Quarter and Riddells Quarter.
The population of Longhorsley Parish is approximately 800 and is essentially a residential community for those who work in South Northumberland and Tyneside.
History.
The village has a long history. In 1196 we find it referred to as Horsieg, a "woodland clearing where horses are kept" - although it was a pretty tough place for a horse: one traveller, Eneas Mackenzie (1778–1832), described it in his view of Northumberland, as "the prolific source of contagious disorders incident to cattle and of little real use in its present state". Longhorsley Moor is high and bleak (in the winter of 1890 the mail-gig was blown over in a gale and the driver found with his neck broken). In the course of time the manor of Longhorsley was owned by the Gospatricks who gave it to the Merlays, and then it passed into the hands of the Horsleys and, later, to the great Catholic family, the Riddells.
Landmarks.
The Devil's Causeway passes the village less than to the west. The causeway is a Roman road which starts at Port Gate on Hadrian's Wall, north of Corbridge, and extends northwards across Northumberland to the mouth of the River Tweed at Berwick-upon-Tweed.
<br>A hoard of Roman coins discovered by metal-detecting enthusiasts on a farm near Longhorsley, Northumberland, could be evidence that entrepreneurial native Northumbrian settlers were recycling old bronze coins and making trinkets to sell back to soldiers in the Roman army, according to experts.
The hoard of 70 Roman coins – 61 sestercii and 9 dupondii — dates from the reign of Emperor Vespasian to the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (AD69–180) — a period when the Antonine Wall, between Glasgow and Edinburgh, and not Hadrian's Wall, marked the northern frontier of the Roman Empire in Britain, and for a short period, Northumberland, which had until then been barbarian territory, became part of the Roman Empire.
The hoard was found close to the route of the Devil's Causeway, the main Roman road which ran north through Northumberland.
Roman expert Lindsay Allason-Jones, Director of Archaeological Museums at Newcastle University, where the coins are shortly to go on display, says: 'What makes this find unusual is that it dates from a period when there was no Roman fort close to Longhorsley, although there were a number of native settlement sites in the area'.
Linden Hall was built in 1812 for Charles William Bigge, a member of one of Northumberland's most notable merchant and banking families. He had acquired the estate from the Earl of Carlisle, whose family had held it since the time of Henry I. His close friend, Sir Charles Monck, designed the mansion, which consisted of six large rooms on each floor, a sweeping staircase with a domed lantern above, and a basement in the main hall. In addition there were kitchens, servants' quarters, a schoolroom, a brew house, a slaughterhouse and stables. In 1861 it passed from the Bigge family into the hands of the Ames, who held it until 1904, when they moved to Ghyllheugh, their Victorian baronial-style house nearby. Linden Hall then passed to the Adamson family, until 1963. The Hall was purchased in 1978 from John Liddell and opened as a first class hotel three years later.
Religious sites.
The Anglican Church of St. Helen, which has registers dating from 1688.
The Roman Catholic church, St Thomas of Canterbury, which was erected in 1841. Before the Catholic church was built, the parish was served from the pele tower which stands adjacent to the present church.

Massoud Azarnoush

Massoud Azarnoush (25 March 1945 – 27 November 2008) was an Iranian archaeologist.
He was born in Kermanshah. He received his MA from the department of archaeology at University of Tehran in 1972 and his PhD from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1985. After returning to Iran, he taught at the University of Tehran before taking up the direction of the Iranian Center for Archaeological Research. He had a fundamental role in reorganizing the ICAR in its new building in the Mas'udieh Palace. Azarnoush helped young archaeologists and students to join to the ICAR and participate in various archaeological research and activities. Although his career was historical archaeology, but he had a keen interest in developing research on the pre- and proto-history of Iran, especially Paleolithic studies. He emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary studies such as archaeobotany and zooarchaeology. Azarnoush welcomed international cooperation, and the series of rescue excavations in the Bulaghi gorge near Pasargadae in cooperation with teams from Germany, France, Poland has been one of the rare successes of archaeological fieldwork in Iran during the past 20 years. He excavated at important sites such as Kangavar, Hamadan, Susa, and Hajiabad where he found a Sassanian manor house at with stucco decorations, which served the basis for his doctoral dissertation and book. He was preparing a field project at the Parthian remains at Qaleh Yazdgird near Kermanshah. He re-investigated Tepe Hegmataneh in Hamadan. His excavations demonstrated that the actual remains date to the Parthian period at the earliest. Median Ecbatana should be sought elsewhere. He died of a heart attack on his return from the excavations at Hamadan at the age of 63.

Brian Loader

Brian D. Loader (born 1958) is a British scholar and Associate Director of the Science and Technology Studies Research Unit (SATSU) and political sociologist at the University of York, UK. Brian joined the Department of Sociology at York in January 2006. His areas of research are new media and participatory cultures, young citizens and political engagement, and community informatics. His overarching interest is in new media communications technologies, and the social, political and economic factors shaping their development and diffusion, and their implications for social, economic, political and cultural change. Brian is the founding Editor of the international journal Information, Communication and Society and has published widely in this area.
Born in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe in 1958 Brian grew up in the UK in Surrey before studying at Southampton University between 1978 and 1981 where he obtained a BSc (Joint Hons.) in Politics and Sociology. He taught public and social policy at Southampton Institute of Higher Education and gained a Master of Public Policy from the University of Bristol in 1989. Moving north to work at the University of Teesside he taught first in the School of Social Sciences before establishing and directing the Community Informatics Research and Applications Unit (CIRA) in 1996.
Interest in the transforming capacities of Internet began in the mid-1990s primarily as a critical response to two discourses that continue to frame discussions about the socio-political influence of new media technologies to this day. The first, addressed in his book "The Governance of Cyberspace" (1997), highlighted and criticised the ‘cyber-libertarian’ portrayals of the Internet as emancipatory spaces divorced from the ‘real world’ of power, place, history and political economy. The second, and related concern, outlined in "The Cyberspace Divide" (1998) was the crucial issue of what impact the Internet would have upon different social groups. These two themes have continued to shape his research interest in how social relations of power are increasingly mediated through information and communication technologies.
Community informatics.
During his time at CIRA Brian together with colleagues at Teesside and worldwide attempted to explore the potential of new media for shaping the development, sustainability and even regeneration of community relations. What they described as community informatics was from the outset concerned with the relationship between geographical places where people lived, worked and socialized and the networked spaces provided by the Internet.
Young citizens.
On arriving at York Brian focused upon the potential of social media to influence the political and civic engagement of young citizens. First, by hosting a small symposium which was later published in an edited collection as "Young Citizens In the Digital Age" (2007) and then by establishing in partnership with Lance Bennett a study group called Networking Young Citizens under the auspices of the World Universities Network. Together with Ariadne Vromen and Mike Xenos, he is undertaking a three country comparative study of the potential influence of social media upon the participatory culture of young citizens entitled The Civic Network which is funded by the Spencer Foundation.
Recent work.
Research interest in the broader impact of new media upon democratic governance began with the publication of "Digital Democracy: Discourse and Decision-Making in the Information Age" (1999) following the first of several conferences devoted to this issue. The use of new media by social movements was first explored in "Cyberprotest: New Media, Citizens and Social Movements" (2004) with other European colleagues collaborating on a COST programme. Most recently, it was the focus of a conference on Networking Democracy held in Cluj, Romania where these themes were further developed in "Social Media and Democracy: social media innovations in participatory politics" (2012).
The potential for new media to shape practices of social care both organisationally and individually has been a longstanding research area. He has been particularly interested in the use of ICTs in re-structuring health and social care organizations and professional practices. With colleagues on an ESRC funded project on Virtual Community Care the use of the Internet as a potential means of online social support revealed the effectiveness of social networking amongst informed participants for facilitating social support. It further foregrounded how such technologies could transform relations between professionals and clients. "Digital Welfare for the Third Age" (2009) developed these ideas on the basis of a UK Department of Health funded project into electronic service delivery for older people.
Brian’s wider interest in social media and the Internet is facilitated through his editorship of the international journal "Information, Communication & Society" (iCS). Included in the prestigious Thompson Reuters Social Science Citation Index iCS is published in ten issues annually. This comprises several special issues including the best papers from both the annual conference of the Association of Internet Researchers and the American Sociological Association section on Communication and Information Technologies. Under Brian’s editorship iCS also hosts regular conferences around the world on a range of topics related to the social, cultural, political and economic influence of new media communications technologies. The most recent were A Decade in Internet Time at Balliol College, Oxford, and at York on The Co-Production of Knowledge.

Milfield

Milfield is a village in Northumberland, England about northwest of Wooler. The A697 road passes through the village.
History.
Milfield is the likely location of the Northumbrian royal settlement of Maelmin, given "mael" is a Brythonic word meaning "field". Bede tells us that a residence was built at Maelmin to supersede Edwin of Northumbria's residence of Ad-Gefrin at Yeavering.
Evidence of a high-status Anglo-Saxon settlement at Milfield strongly suggests that this is the location of Maelmin, because of its proximity to Yeavering.
On Milfield Plain, which is part of the bed of the prehistoric Lake of Glendale, was fought one of the many battles between Scots and English. In the month before the tragedy of Flodden, some Scots, under Alexander Home, 3rd Lord Home, were returning from a raid into England where they had burnt several villages. Laden with booty which they had "lifted", Home's men were surprised by a band of English under Sir William Bulmer of Brancepeth in County Durham. The Durham men were victorious and for long years afterwards the Scots name for the road through Milfield was "The Ill Road". Many years after the rout of Home's men, General Monk waited at Milfield with his forces before his momentous march south which brought about the Restoration.
During the Second World War, an air training unit operated from the nearby RAF Milfield.
Notable people.
One of Northumberland's most notable daughters, Josephine Grey, the social reformer, was born at Milfield House, about six miles from Wooler. This woman, who did so much valuable work in the nineteenth century to combat the social evils of the day, is more generally known by her married name of Butler. At the end of her long life she returned to her beloved Northumberland and is buried in Kirknewton churchyard under the shadow of Yeavering Bell.

Montpelier Recreation Field

Montpelier Recreation Field is a baseball venue located in Montpelier, Vermont, USA and is the home field of the Vermont Mountaineers of the New England Collegiate Baseball League. The field has served as the Mountaineers home since 2003.
History.
The Montpelier Senators and the Twin City Trojans.
The field was constructed in 1940 by the Works Progress Administration, with support from the depression-era Federal Government, featuring a 1,200 seat capacity grandstand (which is still in use today) and bleachers down the firstbase and thirdbase lines. In the first decade of its existence, starting from 1941, it was home to the Montpelier Senators and, later the Twin City Trojans.
Robin Roberts.
During this time the Robin Roberts played at Rec Field for the Twin City Trojans. He remembers his time at the Rec Field fondly: "It was a great experience ... you can’t imagine a guy that age having a better summer then we had in Vermont." "We were really good then. I won 17 straight starts that year in Vermont." In 1976 he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Vermont Mountaineers.
When the league folded in 1952 Rec Field endured a half-century without a professional tenant. This ended in 2003 when the New England Collegiate Baseball League voted to award a franchise to a local Montpelier baseball group. Since then the Rec Field has been the home of the Vermont Mountaineers, enjoying high attendances and success on the field, with the Mountaineers reaching the post-season in six of their seven seasons, including an active six-year streak.
Attendance.
In their inaugural season the Mountaineers enjoyed the highest average attendance in the league and have consistently been near the top of the league in this category since.

Billy Harrison

William Ewart "Billy" Harrison (27 December 1886 – August 1948) was an English footballer who played at outside right.
After a spell with Crewe Alexandra, he spent 1907 to 1920 with Wolverhampton Wanderers, the FA Cup in his first season there. He was later inducted into the club's Hall of Fame. He spent 1920 to 1922 with Manchester United, and later had one-season spells with Port Vale and Wrexham.
Playing career.
Harrison played for Hough United, Crewe South End, Willaston White Star and Crewe Alexandra, before signing for fellow Second Division side Wolverhampton Wanderers for a £400 fee in summer 1907. His first season with the club ended in FA Cup glory, as they won the trophy after defeating Newcastle United 3–1 in the final, with Harrison scoring a fine individual goal. He remained at Molineux for nine full seasons, and 345 games in total.
During World War I he guested for Stoke. He played seven times for the Potters in 1915–16, 31 times in 1916–17, 33 times in 1917–18, and 28 times in 1918–19, scoring a total of 17 goals at the Victoria Ground. Stoke enjoyed some measure of success in the war leagues, finishing as runners-up of the Lancashire Section Secondary Competition Group D in 1916–17, champions of the Lancashire Section Primary Competition in 1917–18, and runners-up in both the Primary Competition and Group C in 1918–19. He returned to Wanderers for the 1919–20 season, as the club posted a 19th place finish.
Harrison moved to Manchester United in October 1920. He went on to score five goals in 46 appearances for the Red Devils, helping United to finish 13th in 1920–21, before they suffered relegation out of the First Division in 1921–22. He left Old Trafford and joined Second Division rivals Port Vale in September 1922. He enjoyed a positive start to the 1922–23 campaign, scoring the only goal of the game against former club Manchester United at The Old Recreation Ground. He was a first-team regular until an ankle injury in October 1922 put him out of action until January 1923. He regained his spot but was sold to Wrexham for £300 in June of that year. He helped the Dragons to a 16th place finish in the Third Division North in 1923–24, before he departed the Racecourse Ground at the age of 38.
Post-retirement.
After retiring from football, Harrison was a pub landlord in Tettenhall, Wolverhampton. He fathered a total of ten children, and remarkably his wife gave birth to triplets on the day of the 1908 FA Cup Final. He died in August 1948, aged 61.

Junior Stanislas

Felix Junior Stanislas (born 26 November 1989), more commonly known as Junior Stanislas is an English footballer who plays for Burnley as a winger in the Championship. 
He started his career in the youth team of West Ham United at the age of 10 in 2000. He signed a three-year academy contract in the summer of 2006, playing regularly for the under-18 side and reserves. In November 2008, he joined Football League One side Southend United on a six-week loan. He made his first-team debut for West Ham in March 2009, at the age of 19. He signed a three-and-a-half-year contract in April 2009. In August 2011, he joined Football League Championship side Burnley on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.
Club career.
West Ham United.
Born in Kidbrooke, London, Stanislas first joined West Ham United as a schoolboy at the age of 10. In May 2006, Stanislas signed a three-year academy scholarship. He made his Premier Academy League debut in a 3–2 defeat to Watford on 8 April 2006, at the age of 16. He became a regular for the Academy in the 2006–07 season, appearing 26 times and scoring 9 goals as West Ham finished as runners-up to Arsenal. He carried his goalscoring form into the 2007–08 season, scoring 10 goals in 24 appearances. He made his Premier Reserve League debut on 29 August 2007, in a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa. His first goals came in the 8–0 rout over Derby County, as he netted a brace. He was part of the first-team squad that travelled to North America in the summer of 2008 for the pre-season tour. He started the 2008–09 season in the reserves, scoring his first goal of the season on 21 October 2008, in a 1–0 home win over Arsenal.
Loan to Southend United.
On 27 November 2008, Stanislas joined League One side Southend United on loan for six weeks. He made an immediate impact on his professional debut, scoring a brace, including a spectacular free kick, against Luton Town in the FA Cup second round on 29 November. His league debut came on 6 December in a 3–0 defeat, away at Leicester City. His first goal for Southend came on 26 December as he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over Northampton Town, which brought to end a run of seven league games without victory. He was part of the side that earned a memorable 1–1 draw with Chelsea at stamford bridge in the FA Cup third round. However, Southend could not repeat their heroics at Roots Hall as the Shrimpers lost 4–1 in the replay. Stanislas returned to West Ham on 19 January 2009, after a 3–1 defeat to Stockport County at Edgeley Park. He made a total of 9 appearances in all competitions, scoring 3 goals.
Return to West Ham.
Stanislas made his West Ham and Premier League debut on 16 March 2009 against bottom of the table West Bromwich Albion, replacing Savio Nsereko in the second half. He scored his first goal on his first start for the club, in a 2–0 home win against Sunderland on 4 April. On 9 April, he signed his first professional contract, a long-term four-and-a-half-year deal, lasting until the summer of 2013. He had an extended run in the first-team when first choice midfielders Valon Behrami and Jack Collison were both out injured. On 24 May, the last game of the season, Stanislas scored the winner in the 2–1 win over Middlesbrough, which sealed Boro's relegation to the Championship. He made a total of 9 appearances for West Ham, scoring 2 goals in the 2008–09 season.
Stanislas started the 2009–10 season as a first team regular featuring in the first 5 games, including a 2–0 away win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. He also scored a brace in West Ham's 3–1 League Cup second round victory over arch-rivals Millwall in August 2009. The first goal came three minutes from time before scoring a penalty kick winner in extra time. However, the game was marred by the 2009 Upton Park riot which included pitch invasions after both of Stanislas' goals. His second goal of the season came on 4 October 2009, when he came off the bench to score a last minute equaliser in a 2–2 draw with Fulham. His final goal of the season was on 28 November 2009, scoring the second goal in a 5–3 win over Burnley. He remained a first-team player until the end of the season featuring heavily in the run-in as West Ham secured their Premier League safety. Stanislas made a total of 28 appearances in all competitions, scoring 4 goals in the 2009–10 season.
In the summer of 2010, Gianfranco Zola was replaced by Avram Grant as manager and Stanislas found himself down the pecking order at Upton Park. His first appearance of the season was on 24 August 2010, in a 1–0 win over Oxford United in the Football League Cup. He had a prolonged spell in the first team during November and December, making 5 appearances. On 18 December 2010, he scored the equalising goal against Blackburn Rovers in a 1–1 draw at Ewood Park, after coming on as a substitute for Pablo Barrera in the second half. His final game of the season was on 1 January 2011, in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. In January 2011, he was ruled out until the end of the season after undergoing hernia surgery. After four months out, he made his comeback for the reserves on 11 May, playing 30 minutes in a 3–2 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He made a total of 8 appearances in all competitions, scoring 1 goal in the 2010–11 season as West Ham were relegated to the Football League Championship.
The summer again brought a change of manager with Sam Allardyce replacing the departed Avram Grant. His first game of the season was in the league game against Doncaster Rovers on 13 August 2011, coming on as a late substitute for Herita Ilunga in a 1–0 victory. On 24 August 2011, he scored his first goal of the season in what proved to be his final appearance for the Hammers, in their 2–1 League Cup defeat to Aldershot Town.
Burnley.
On 31 August 2011, Stanislas joined fellow Football League Championship side Burnley on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee, becoming the club's seventh summer signing. He stated the main reason for leaving West Ham was due to lack of game time. His debut for the Clarets came on 10 September, in a 2–0 defeat to Middlesbrough at Turf Moor, coming on as a second-half substitute for Keith Treacy. His first start for the club came on 24 September, in a 1–1 draw with Southampton. He provided two assists 3 days later for Jay Rodriguez in the 5–1 drubbing of Nottingham Forest. On 3 December, he returned to his old club as Burnley secured a 2–1 victory, with Stanislas providing the assist for the Chris McCann equaliser. In January 2012, he sustained a hamstring injury against Middlesbrough which kept him sidelined for two months. His return came on 10 March 2012, in a 1–1 home draw with Crystal Palace, coming on in the final few minutes for Martin Paterson. His final appearance of the season was in the 1–1 draw with Bristol City as Burnley finished mid-table. Stanislas made a total of 32 appearances in his debut season for Burnley, scoring no goals.
In his second season at Turf Moor, Stanislas was again a regular first-teamer; appearing in all but 11 league matches and scoring 5 goals.
International career.
Stanislas has been capped for England at under-19, under-20 and under-21 level. He was called up to the England U19 squad for the first time in November 2007, along with West Ham team-mate, James Tomkins, for a friendly against Germany. His second call-up came in February 2008, for a friendly against Croatia at the County Ground, Swindon. On 31 March 2009, he made his debut for the England U20's in a 2–0 win over Italy, coming on as a substitute for Scott Sinclair in a friendly at Loftus Road. He received his first call-up to the England U21 side for a friendly against the Netherlands on 11 August 2009 and made his debut starting in the 0–0 draw. In September 2009, Stuart Pearce then named him in the squad for the 2011 European Championship qualifiers against Macedonia and Greece. His final appearance for the team on 4 September, in the 2–1 victory over Macedonia, before being an unused substitute in the 1–1 draw with Greece four days later.
He is eligible to play for the Saint Lucia national team through his father, Felix. He said "I'm half St Lucian so I could play internationals for them if I wanted... but I don't."

Potassium spatial buffering

Potassium Spatial Buffering is a mechanism for the regulation of extracellular potassium concentration by astrocytes. Other mechanisms for astrocytic potassium clearance are carrier-operated or channel-operated potassium chloride uptake.
The depolarization of neurons tends to raise potassium concentration in the extracellular fluid. If a significant rise occurs, it will interfere with neuronal signaling by depolarizing neurons. Astrocytes have large numbers of potassium ion channels facilitating removal of potassium ions from the extracellular fluid. They are taken up at one region of the astrocyte and then distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, and further to its neighbors via gap junctions. This keeps extracellular potassium at levels that prevent interference with normal propagation of an action potential.
Potassium Spatial Buffering.
Glial cells, once believed to have a passive role in CNS, are active regulators of numerous functions in the brain, including clearance of the neurotransmitter from the synapses, guidance during neuronal migration, control of neuronal synaptic transmission, and maintaining ideal ionic environment for active communications between neurons in central nervous system.
Neurons are surrounded by extracellular fluid rich in sodium ions and poor in potassium ions. The concentrations of these ions are reversed inside the cells. Due to the difference in concentration, there is a chemical gradient across the cell membrane, which leads to sodium influx and potassium efflux. When the action potential takes place, a considerable change in extracellular potassium concentration occurs due to the limited volume of the CNS extracellular space. The change in potassium concentration in extracellular space impacts variety of neuronal processes, such as maintenance of membrane potential, activation and inactivation of voltage gated channels, synaptic transmission, and electrogenic transport of neurotransmitter. Change of extracellular potassium concentration of from 3mM can affect neural activity. Therefore, there are diverse cellular mechanisms for tight control of potassium ions, the most widely accepted mechanisms being K+ spatial buffering mechanism. Orkand and his colleagues who first theorized spatial buffering stated “if a Glial cell becomes depolarized by K+ that has accumulated in the clefts, the resulting current carries K+ inward in the high region and out again, through electrically coupled Glial cells in low [K+ regions” 
In the model presented by Orkand and his colleagues, glial cells intake and traverse potassium ions from region of high concentrations to region of low concentration maintaining potassium concentration to be low in extracellular space. Glial cells are well suited for transportation of potassium ions since it has unusually high permeability to potassium ions and traverse long distance by its elongated shape or by being coupled to one another.
Potassium regulatory mechanisms.
Potassium buffering can be broadly categorized into two categories: Potassium uptake and Potassium spatial buffering. For potassium uptake, excess potassium ions are temporarily taken into glial cells through transporters, or potassium channels. In order to preserve electroneutrality, potassium influxes into glial cells are accompanied by influx of chlorine or efflux of sodium. It is expected that when potassium accumulates within glial cells, water influx and swelling occurs. For potassium spatial buffering, functionally coupled glial cells with high potassium permeability transfer potassium ions from regions of elevated potassium concentration to regions of lower potassium concentration. The potassium current is driven by the difference in glial syncytium membrane potential and local potassium equilibrium potential. When one region of potassium concentration increases, there is a net driving force causing potassium to flow into the glial cells. The entry of potassium causes a local depolarization that propagates electrotonically through the glial cell network which causes net driving force of potassium out of the glial clls. This process causes dispersion of local potassium with little net gain of potassium ions within the glial cells, which in turn prevents swelling. Glial cell depolarization caused by neuronal activity releases potassium onto blood stream, which was once widely hypothesized to be cause of vessel relaxation, was found to have little affect on neurovascular coupling. Despite the efficiency of potassium spatial buffering mechanisms, in certain regions of CNS, potassium buffering seems more dependent on active uptake mechanisms rather than spatial buffering. Therefore, the exact role of glial potassium spatial buffering in the various regions of our brain still remains uncertain.
Kir Channel.
The high permeability of glial cell membranes to potassium ions are result of expression of high density of potassium selective channels with high open probability at resting membrane potentials. Kir channels, potassium inward rectifying channels, are named after its attributes of allowing the passage of potassium ions inwared much more readily in comparison to outward direction. It also has interesting feature of displaying a variable conductance, where the conductance positively correlates with the extracellular potassium concentration, which means that higher the potassium concentration outside the cell, higher the conductance through these channels. 
Kir channels are categorized into seven major subfamilies, Kir1 to Kir7. Kir channels have different gating mechanisms as well. Kir3 and Kir6 are primarily activated by intracellular G-protein subunit. Because it has relatively low open probability compared to rest of its families, it has little impact on potassium buffering. Kir1 and Kir7 are mainly expressed in epithelia cells, such as those in kidney, choroid plexus, or retinal pigment epithelium and have no impact on spatial buffering. Kir2 however are expressed in brain and glial cell population. Kir4 and Kir5 are, along with Kir2 are located in Muller cells and have important role in potassium siphoning. There are some discrepancies among studies on expression of these channels in stated locations.
Panglial Syncytium.
The panglial syncytium is a large network of interconnected glial cells, which are extensively linked by gap junctions. The panglial syncytium spreads through central nervous system where it provides metabolic and osmotic support, as well as ionic regulation of myelinated axons in white matter tracts. The three types of macroglial cells within network of panglial syncytium are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymocytes. Originally it was believed that there was homologous gap junction between oligodendrocytes. It was later found through untrastructural analysis that gap junctions do not directly link adjacent oligodendrocytes, rather it gap junctions with adjacent astrocytes, providing secondary pathway to nearby oligodendrocytes. With direct gap junction between myelin sheaths to surrounding astrocytes, excess potassium and osmotic water directly enters astrocyte syncytium, where it downstream to astrocyte endfeet at capillaries and the glia limitans. 
Potassium siphoning.
Potassium spatial buffering that occurs in the retina is called potassium siphoning, where the Muller cell is the principal glial cell type. Muller cells have important role in retinal physiology. It maintains retinal cell metabolism and are critical in maintaining potassium homeostasis in extracellular space during neuronal activity. Like cells responsible for spatial buffering, Muller cells are distinctively permeable to potassium ions through Kir channels. Like other glial cells, the high selectivity of Muller cell membranes to potassium ions is due to the high density of Kir channels. Potassium conductance is unevenly distributed in Muller cells. By focally increasing potassium ions along amphibian Muller cells and recording the resulting depolarization, the observed potassium conductance was concentrated in the endfoot process of 94% of the total potassium conductance localized to the small subcellular domain. The observation lead to hypothesis that excess potassium in extracellular space is “siphoned” by the Muller cells to the vitreous humor. Potassium siphoning is a specialized form of spatial buffering mechanisms where large reservoir of potassium ions is emptied into vitreous humor. Similar distribution patter of Kir channels could be found in amphibians.
History.
Existence of potassium siphoning was first reported in 1966 study by Orkand et al. In the study, optic nerve of Necturus was dissected to document the long-distance movement of potassium after the nerve stimulation. Following the low frequency stimulation of .5 Hz at the retinal end of the dissected optic nerve, depolarization 1-2mV was measured at astrocytes at the opposite end of the nerve bundle, which was up to several millimeters from the electrode. With higher frequency stimulation, higher plateau of depolarization was observed. Therefore, they hypothesized that the potassium released to extracellular compartment during axonal activity entered and depolarized nearby astrocytes, where it was transported away by unfamiliar mechanism, which caused depolarization on astrocytes distant from site of stimulation. The proposed model was actually inappropriate since at the time neither gap junctions nor syncytium among glial cells were known, and optic nerve of Necturus are unmyelinated, which means that potassium efflux occurred directly into the periaxonal extracellular space, where potassium ions in extracellular space would be directly absorbed into the abundant astrocytes around axons.
Diseases.
In patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), abnormalities occur in astrocyte, which leads to pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction in this disease. TSC is a multisystem genetic disease with mutation in either TSC1 or TSC2 gene. It results in disabling neurological symptoms such as mental retardation, autism, and seizures. Glial cells have important physiological roles of regulating neuronal excitability and preventing epilepsy. Astrocytes maintain homeostasis of excitatory substances, such as extracellular potassium, by immediate uptake through specific potassium channels and sodium potassium pumps. It is also regulated by potassium spatial buffering via astrocyte networks where astrocytes are coupled through gap junctions. Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 gene often results in decreased expression of the astrocytic connexin protein, Cx43. With impairment in gap junction coupling between astrocytes, myriad of abnormalities in potassium buffering occurs which results in increased extracellular potassium concentration and may predispose to neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. According to a study done on animal model, connexin43-deficient mice showed decreased threshold for the generation of epileptiform events. The study also demonstrated role of gap junction in accelerating potassium clearance, limiting potassium accumulation during neuronal firing, and relocating potassium concentrations.
Demyelinating Diseases of the central nervous system, such as Neuromyelitis Optica, often leads to molecular components of the panglial syncytium being compromised, which leads to blocking of potassium spatial buffering. Without mechanism of potassium buffering, potassium induced osmotic swelling of myelin occurs where myelins are destroyed and axonal salutatory conduction ceases.

UiTM Faculty of Law

UiTM Faculty of Law is one of the professional graduate faculty of UiTM and is located in Shah Alam, Malaysia.
The current Dean of the faculty is Associate Professor Saudah Sulaiman, who assumed the role in 2007.
The faculty currently consists of some 69 academic staff. It has about 1,144 students studying pre-law, BLS (Hons) and LL.B (Hons) and postgraduate programmes (Ph.D. and LL.M. programmes).
Programmes.
Undergraduate.
In 1978, the LL.B (Hons) University of London programme was discontinued and replaced by the Diploma in Law (DIL) programme. The DIL programme is equivalent to the LL.B programme offered in British Universities. It is a three-year academic programme based on the structure of British Universities undergraduate law programmes. Unlike most of the British programmes however, the DIL programme at the faculty is conducted on a semester system. 
Soon after, the faculty had renamed its programmes and DIL was renamed as the LL.B (general law degree). The LL.B programme, however, was replaced with the Bachelor of Legal Studies (Hons) or BLS (Hons), which was introduced in 2002. 
In 1982, the Faculty introduced a one-year Advanced Diploma in Law (ADIL) programme for graduates of the DIL programme. The ADIL programme is equivalent to a LL.B (Hons) degree and recognised for legal practice. It is a simulatory programme designed to provide professional training for students in preparation for their career in the legal practice as Advocates and Solicitors. ADIL then became the LL.B (Hons). This LL.B(Hons) programme is unique in which it was designed after the Inns of Court in England. The students are put in a simulated legal office environment in which they are designated in firms and given case studies.
Reference to the Common Bar Course (CBC).
Early in March 2011, the Attorney-General announced that the Legal Qualifying Board was considering implementing the Common Bar Course (CBC). Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abdul Wahab Patail is chairing a working group to study its implementation. The CBC would be a 20-month course that would also focus on vocational skills. The CBC model combines the modern legal education approaches in other Commonwealth countries as well as local requirements. There will be modules not commonly seen in other courses to meet specific needs among local graduates, such as the Legal Language and Communication Skills to address the poor command of English and the Practice Management Skills to expose lawyers intending to start their own firm on risk management. Of the five semesters, the first three are full-time studies while the final two are part-time, where students will be pupils at law firms concurrently. It will also feature a Student Law Office programme where the "students-at-law" will get to practice what they have learned in a simulated legal environment, which has been successfully carried out in UiTM Faculty of Law.
Controversy.
In 2007, former Dean, Khalid Yusoff, was jailed three months for forgery and cheating in the July 2001 Certificate in Legal Practice examination "master list". In May 2010, he was freed by the Court of Appeal.

Gabriel Bokilo

Gabriel Bokilo (20 July 1938 – 26 March 2010) was a Congolese politician and the President of the Union for National Redress (URN).
Administrative career.
Bokilo studied in France and earned a doctorate. He became Prefect of Nkéni in 1963 and then Secretary-General of the Brazzaville city government in 1964; later, he became Director of the Cabinet of the Minister of Justice, Labour, and the Civil Service in 1967. He then briefly headed the Congolese branch of Société Générale and was subsequently the National Director of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) in Congo-Brazzaville from 1973 to 1993; he was also Alternate Governor at the World Bank from 1973 to 1974 and Alternate Governor at the International Monetary Fund from 1975 to 1993.
Political career.
Following the introduction of multiparty politics, Bokilo became President of the URN, a political party. In the June–July 1992 parliamentary election, he was elected to the National Assembly as the URN candidate in the Mossaka constituency of Cuvette Region. He was also the URN candidate for the August 1992 presidential election, but he attracted little support, receiving 0.29% of the vote and placing 13th. Bokilo, who was a member of the opposition coalition, then served as Minister of Trade, Consumption, and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the power-sharing government of Prime Minister Claude Antoine Dacosta from 1992 to 1993. He left his post as BEAC National Director following his appointment to the government.
Later, following the 1997 civil war, Bokilo was a member of the National Transitional Council (CNT), which acted as the provisional parliament from 1998 to 2002, and during that time he was President of the CNT's Economic Commission. He was a candidate for the position of Director-General of Air Afrique in April 1999.
In the 2002 parliamentary election, he was again elected to the National Assembly as the URN candidate in Mossaka 1 constituency; he won the seat in the first round with 53.45% of the vote. After the election, he was chosen as President of the National Assembly's Economy and Finance Commission on 24 August 2002.
The URN initially signed an agreement to merge into the New Democratic Forces (FDN) on 27 March 2007. At the new party's constitutive congress, which began on 19 April 2007, Bokilo was not chosen as President of the FDN; he then announced that he was withdrawing the URN from the FDN on 20 April, saying that "fundamental differences have emerged" and he had "decided on behalf of the party to denounce the agreement". In the 2007 parliamentary election, Bokilo stood again as the URN candidate in Mossaka 1 constituency. In the first round, he placed second behind Léon-Raphaël Mokoko, an independent candidate, receiving 21.21% of the vote against 46.01% for Mokoko. He was then defeated by Mokoko in the second round.
Beginning in 2007, Bokilo's health declined and he frequently visited Paris for medical treatment. He was hospitalized in Paris on 18 March 2010 and died of colon cancer on 26 March.

Ata Hussain Fani Chishti

Hazrat Ata Hussain Fani (1816–1893), also known as Ata Hussain Gayavi or Haji Ata Hussain Chishti Monami Abulolai, was a famous Sufi saint of the chisti order in South Asia. He was the first Sufi to go in the complete non-Muslim locality of Gaya and spread Islam. He was also a writer, poet, linguist, and orator.
Although he never touched money with his hands he lived an extravagant life. He was known to befriend strangers, especially non-Muslims, was very well liked among his people. There were thousands of converts (both humans and Genie) to Islam that he was responsible for. His aim in life was to serve all human beings on earth and spread the message which the Prophet Muhammad brought. He died as the Ghaus, which is the highest degree of spirituality a Sufi can attain, of his time.
Biography.
Ata Hussain Fani Chishti Munami was born in 1816 into a pious family of saints of the chisti order at the home of his maternal grandfather, known as Khanqah Qadria Mannania, Shah mannan ki garhi,Mughalpura, Patna City Bihar, India. He was raised by his father Sultan Ahmed Shaheed through the age of 10. After the death of his father, his paternal grandfather Ghulam Hussain Danapuri took responsibility for him. He died at the age of 86, just 9 years after being made the successor of the ancestral Khanqah. After the death of his grandfather, he was nurtured by his maternal uncle Ala Hazrat Meer Qamruddin Husain Monami, who completed his worldly studies as well as spiritual teachings and awarded him Khilafat-o-Ijazat(Ijazah) upon completion.
Ancestral history.
Hazrat Ata Hussain Fani was born into one of the most famous Syed families of Bihar. He was the descendant of Syedna Imam Muhammad al-Baqir. After the death of Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, Jafar al-Sadiq became the imam of the Muslim community. Another Son of Imam Muhammad al-Baqir was Abdullah Shaheed. His descendants migrated to Tus in present Iran. After a few generations, one of the descendants migrated to Lahore, Pakistan. Later on a scholar from the branch of Baqri Sayyids known as Tajuddin Dehlvi migrated towards India via Ajmer. He became a murid and Khalifa of Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer. He send him to Delhi in the company of Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki. He later settled in Delhi. His son went to Kalpi, Uttar Pradesh, India to spread Islam.

He had had four sons who carried his lineage forward. He made Shah-e-Ata his Spiritual Successor and the Successor of the ancestral Khanquah of Tajuddin Dehlvai in front of all his companions, disciples, khalifas and family members. He also had many Khalifas all over Bihar. He died at the age of 86 and his shrine is present in Danapur.
Final settlement.
Hazrat Ata Hussain Fani walked to the Mecca at Haj when he was 28. The journey took a total of 5 years. He was finally ordered by the Muhammad spiritually to go back to India and spread the light of Islam and accept the responsibility as a Qutub of Gaya where he lived, died and was buried. He reached Gaya in 1850. He arrived at the house of the district judge of Gaya, Syed Ashraf Hussain Sadrus Sudoor (who had already been shown the face of Shah-e-Ata in dreams and was told to welcome him whole heartedly).
Spiritual history.
He had ijaza of approximately 70 ways of all the major orders of the world including all the famous orders of eastern India.

Titles given.
The most important of all the titles given to him is Abdul Razzaq by Muhammad when he went to Medina and was produced in front of the court of Prophet.
Other titles are as follows:
Descendants.
Shah-e-ata was married to a descendant of Maqdum-e-Jahan Syed Sharfuddin Yahya maneri of Bihar Sharif. He had only three children, one son and two daughters out of which only two carried the lineage forward. One of his daughters did not have any children. His son is remembered as Syed Shah Ghulam Qutubuddin Chishti. All of his grandsons and great grandsons were great Sufis of their time. It is seen as enormous blessings from the Prophet Muhammad that there are great Sufis in each generation of his descendants.
The succession of the Sajjada of his ancestral Khanqah has always been in his son's descendants. Only his son had the authority to offer the duties of the Sajjada nashin in his absence. Shah Qutubuddin Chishti was his son. When he died his son became the successor of Shah-e-ata and since then the Sajjada nashin remained with the descendants of Shah Qutubuddin.
Syed Shah Ghulam Qutubuddin Chishti.
He was the only son of Shah-e-ata. He was born in 1838. He became a murid (disciple) of his father in the Chishti Order. He lived wholly in the company of his father and he gained all his education from his father. He completed all his spiritual courses of enlightenment from his father as well and became a successful spiritual leader of his time.
It was a culture among the pandas (a caste amongst Hindus who perform a type of worship for the peace of the soul of the dead) that a devotee gave them a horse or any animal to them after they perform the worship for the peace of their relatives' soul. If the horse used to be naughty and disobedient they used to bring it to Hazrat Qutubuddin. Qutubuddin used to take a small ride on it and the horse would become obedient. Once a horse that would not let anyone even touch his back was brought to him. Qutubuddin sat on the horse at one go and went for a ride. The horse tried vigorously to get him dashed on any wall, tree, or, any solid surface but all its attempts went in vain. Qutubuddin pushed his thighs slightly and the horse started gasping but kept on behaving badly. Qutubuddin at last got down, lifted the horse and thrashed him on the ground. This incident occurred near Ghandhi Maidan (it was then known as Church ka maidan (field)). Oldham, the then District collector of Gaya was sitting in his garden, was shocked to see this happen and remarked "Is he a man or a giant? He lifted and thrashed the horse on the ground with his hands!".
Many such unbelievable incidents occurred in the short span of his life. He dedicated his life in helping his father in spreading the mission of the Prophet Muhammad. He died young at the age of 49,in 1887, and left behind a son.
Syed Shah Nezamuddin Chishti Monami.
He was the only child of Shah Qutubuddin. He was born in 1860. He wanted to become the murid of his paternal grandfather, Shah-e-ata but Shah-e-ata ordered him to become a murid of his father and so he did. He had Khilafat(Ijazah) of all orders from both his father and grandfather. He was a great Hakeem and a versatile person. He learned in the company of his father and grandfather. Moreover he gained education from teachers and scholars at Gaya and Bihar Sharif. He also attended Bankipur Engineering College at Patna and got a degree from there.
Like his grandfather he was well-versed in all fields of education ranging from Theology,[History, Fiqh, Engineering, Tib(Medical Science), Tassawwuf and Jurisprudence. He was the unparalleled leader of his time. Everyone from the District collector to the Judge used to seek his advice on difficult matters. He was offered many political and administrative positions throughout his life but he always refused softly saying,"I'm a Fakir(Dervish). How can I accept these responsibilities?".
He became the successor of Shah-e-ata after his death in 1889. After becoming the Sajjada nashin he went to the dargah of Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer to pay his homage before starting a new chapter of his life as the Sajjada nashin of the ancestral Khanqah founded by Tajuddin delhvi, the murid and khalifa of Moinuddin Chishti. Once during this visit he told his companions to leave him alone as he was not feeling well. Everyone went and he was left alone in the room. Suddenly everyone noticed a fire on the roof and in the room. Everyone rushed to see Nezamuddin and found him as he was when they had left. They went away puzzled. Again they saw the same scenario and realised that there was an illuminated chain of blaze like light from the tomb of Moinuddin Chishti to the room of the Hazrat. The scenario remained the same for the whole night. Even afterwards he had great spiritual connections with Gharibnawaz and Sufis like Ghaus-e-Pak and Maqdum-e-jahan. His physical strengths were also reported to be no less than those of his father.
He was also a great educator. He founded the first ever Islamic study centre in the entire Bihar with the name Darse-Nezami on the name of great Sufi Nizamuddin Auliya in 1901. It was larger than a traditional Madrasah and the centre of all educational activities around Gaya and the Magadha region. Subjects excluding Islamic studies were also taught there. This institution had many ups and downs but is still present and is now known as Al-Jamia-tul-Ata.
He lived for 44 years and died in 1904. His first marriage was to the daughter of Shah Enayat Ali Maudidi-a descendant of Maudood Chishti, and he had a son named Syed Shah Hussainuddin Safi who became his successor. His second marriage was to the daughter of Akbar Danapuri-a great Abulolai Sufi, and had three more sons, Hafiz Hakeem Syed Shah Qayamuddin, Syed Shah Hesamuddin Chishti and Syed Shah Ehteshamuddin Chishti, as well as one daughter. Two of his sons, Shah Qayamuddin and Shah Ehteshamuddin, died young and before they could be married. His daughter also died without bearing any sons to carry on his lineage. He was buried in his ancestral home at Danapur, Patna near the grave of his ancestors Syed-ul-Waseleen and Syed-ul-Majzubeen.
Shah Hussainuddin Safi.
He was known as Syed Shah Hussainuddin Safi Chishti. He was the eldest son of Shah Nezamuddin Chishti. He was born in 1303 of the Islamic calendar. His initial education was completed in his maternal home at Sheikhpura. He learnt Persian from Maulvi Fasahat Hussain and Arabic from Syed Mohammed Isameil and Syed Abdullah Bazeedpuri. He went on to complete his studies from Darse-Nezamia founded by his father.
He became a murid of his father in the Chishti Order and got the khilafatIjazah of all the orders from his father. He spiritual teachings were initiated by his father. Since his father died when he was very young, he got Owaisiat(a state in Tasawwuf in which one can meet the soul of a Sufi master just as the master was alive and learn spiritual lessons directly from the master) from Shah-e-ata and this is how his spiritual teachings were completed.
He became the Sajjada nashin of the ancestral Khanqah in 1904. The Khanqah achieved its highest peak during his reign on the Sajjada. Everyone used to call him the exact copy of Shah-e-ata in every way. He took the charge of Darse Nezamia founded by his father, after his father's death. Apart from the traditional methods of the Khanqah of preaching, he instead opted for many modern methods of teaching.
It was an organization for all Muslim brethren. A programme that was organised on the 17th of every Islamic month. Speeches of different Ulema and Sufi were organized in the campus of Khanqah. This group also had the responsibility of the burial of anonymous dead bodies of Muslims. This group is still in existence and the present Sajjada nashin of the Khanqah is the Chief of this organisation.
Print media has always been an important means to communicate with the masses so he founded a publication house with the name of' Matbua-Monamia' for the publication of different manuscripts preserved in the ancestral library of the Khanqah. This was the first publication house ever founded in Gaya. He published many books written by his ancestors, especially those written by Shah-e-ata and his disciples. He authored many books, including the biography of many great Islamic personalities like Jalaluddin Tabrezi and Maqdum Munampak. He was the first to write the biography of Maqdum Munampak and Shah-e-ata. He also wrote travelogues. He was the first to write the history of Zahidia order in Bihar. He has also worked over Tasawwuf to a great extent. He added much to the Islamic literature in Bihar and to the literature of Munami Order.
In the early 19th century Wahabism had arrived in India and many groups had come up against Sunni Islam and especially against the Khanqah of that time. Shah Hussainuddin Safi founded a group of learned people and Islamic scholars who would fight against any type of anti-Sunni activities rising anywhere in Bihar. He brought all the scholars, masters, Sufis of all orders and other khanqahs of Bihar together. This is why he is remembered as Wakeel-ul-Mashaiq (leader of all the masters) by his contemporaries.
He died at the age of 55, in 1939, leaving behind a son and daughter. He had three marriages. He did not have any children from his first wife. After the death of his first wife he married again and had children, but they all died as infants. His second wife died soon after. His third marriage produced two children who have carried his lineage forward. His son, Amir-ul-Mashaiq Syed Shah Ghulam-e-Mustafa Ahmed Chishti is the present Sajjada nashin of the Khanqah. He had thousands of disciples and khalifa all over the Indian sub-continent who have carried his spiritual teachings forward.
Shah Hesamuddin Chishti.
Born in 1899, he was the third son of Shah Nezamuddin Chishti. He gained education at Dars-e-Nezamia on the campus of Khanqah and from his eldest brother, Shah Hussainuddin Safi. He became a disciple of his brother in the ancestral Chishti Order. The master awarded him Khilafat Ijazah of all the orders after completing all his spiritual teachings himself. He was a great linguist and had thorough knowledge of Urdu, Persian, Arabic and English. He was serving as the Chief librarian of the Jamia Millia Islamia when Shah Hussainuddin Safi called him in 1938, and gave him all the responsibilities of the Khanqah. He was a very immaculate and soft spoken person.
He left for Pakistan in 1958 after making his nephew, the son of Shah Hussainuddin Safi into the new Sajjada nashin of the Khanqah. He had two marriages. He had one daughter from the first marriage, and six children, one son and five daughters from the second marriage. He died in 1992, at the age of 93, leaving behind thousands of disciples all over India and Pakistan and was buried in Yaseenabad graveyard, Azizabad, Karachi.
Amir-ul-Mashaiq.
He was born on 14 December 1936 which coincides with 29th of Ramzan 1355 of the Islamic calendar. Before his birth the "Khadim" of the Dargah of the great Sufi of Chishti Order, Noor Qutb-e-Aalam Pandwi, Pandua, West Bengal, Hafiz Peer Mohammad Monami saw dreams where Shah Nur-Qutb-e-Aalam Pandwi was saying "Inform Shah Hussainuddin Ahmed that he will be bestowed with a son, he should name him Ghulam-e-Mustafa". And so, when Amir-ul-Mashaiq was born he was named Ghulam-e-Mustafa Ahmed. He has learned from various teachers and scholars all over Gaya and Patna.
When Amir-ul-Mashaiq was only two and a half years old, his father died. Before his death, Shah Hussainuddin Safi put the ancestral cap of the Sajjada nashin on his head, and announced him as his successor and the heir of all his personal and ancestral belongings of the Khanqah.
Amir-ul-Mashaiq had a unique childhood. He was never seen playing games with his friends, or in any playground. He used to study his lessons or do Zikr and read wazifa or recite the Quran. When Amir-ul-Mashaiq was a child, Shah Hussainuddin Safi had made him his disciple in the ancestral Chishti order and left the khilafatnama (certificate of Ijazah) for him. When Amir-ul-Mashaiq grew up he accepted the oath, on the hand of his paternal uncle, Shah Hesamuddin Chishti and was awarded the Khilafat. He was also told that "You are already a murid and have the khilfat from your father. It's now upon you, you can use either my Khilafat or your fathers'". Amir-ul-Mashaiq, as a sign of respect, has always used the khilafat of his uncle which also includes the name of his father.
Amir-ul-Mashaiq served as the Sajjada nashin of the Khanqah for 54 years. He died on the 30 January 2012, which coincides with 6th of Rabīʿ I 1433 hijri. His funeral rites took place on the following day after the nemaz of Asr. His mausoleum is erected just adjacent to Shah-e-Ata, as the place of tomb was revealed to the eldest grandson of Amir-ul-Mashaiq.
He had thousands of disciples all over India, Pakistan, and the USA, and he also had many khalifas all over India. He was married to a descendant of Abdul-Qadir Gilani, the eldest daughter of Hakeem Abdur-Rahim Qadri, AmjharSharif, Aurangabad, Bihar. He had three sons, Faqr-e-ulema Alhaaj Maulana Syed Mohammed Sabahuddin Chishti, Syed Ata Ahmed Fuzail, and Hafiz Syed Ata Faisal. He also had eight daughters.
Each Sufi of Gaya has learned spiritual lessons from him. This is why he is known as Amir-ul-Mashaiq (the master of all masters). Sufis throughout the order felt extremely impressed by his spirituality after meeting him. His personality was unparalleled all over Bihar.Ulema and Sufi loved his company and he loved to impart spiritual lessons to everyone. There have many converts to Islam at his hands. Even Wahhabi and Deobandi accept him as the true leader of the Muslim community. He is very soft spoken and not any seeker of any particular thing, Knowledge, Spirituality, Tranquility, or wealth. No one, even a child returns empty-handed from his doors. His doors of the Khanqah are still open for everyone, around the clock.
Disciples.
It is believed that he had approximately of 60,000 disciples all over Asia. The number of Khalifas is understood to be many hundreds. Many of his disciples went on to become very successful Sufi of their time. Though the list is very long, only a few are listed here.
Razzaqi order.
Since Shah-e-Ata was given the title of Abdul Razzaq his disciples and Sufis of his order proudly wrote themselves as Sufis of Razzaqi order. Thus the Razzaqi Order came into existence.
Famous disciples.
One major reason for the loss of information regarding many of his Khalifas was that it was lost during India's First War of Independence in 1857. The second cause was when the Wahhabi extremists formed Saudi Arabia and Sufis had to leave that region. Shah-e-Ata's Khulfas and their successors in the Middle East went out of touch and could not be traced after that.
Much information regarding Sufis of the Razzaqi order was lost during the Partition of India in 1947.So much less information regarding the disciples and Sufis of the order of Shah-e-Ata is available. Some information has been recovered from the book of Shahe-e-Ata, Kaifya-tul-Aarfeen wa Nisbatul Aasheqeen, which was published twice, once during the life of the author and again in the life of his great grandson, Shah Hussainuddin Safi.
Many other Sufis who are the successors of the disciples of Shah-e-Ata have been tracked down since 1970 and have become an important source of information regarding the Razzaqi order and the history of Razzaqi order in different parts of Asia.
Only the most famous Sufis are listed below, whose orders are still present by means of any living Sufi and as long as their successors are still in touch with the successors of Shah-e-Ata.
Syed Shah Qazi Mazahir Imam.
He was the most loved disciple of Shah-e-ata. Initially he was hesitant to become a disciple of any Sufi master, (though he wanted Shah-e-ata to be his master), as his father was also the disciple of Shah-e-ata. Shah-e-ata used to say that "it seems that you are very hesitant to accept oath so i will have to take your oath forcefully". The words of Shah-e-ata became true. Qazi Mazahir was an immaculately beautiful person with a charismatic personality. He was once listening to Sema in the Manpur locality of Gaya district and a man who was looking for a Pir after completion of all his studies came to him respectfully and requested him to make him his disciple. Qazi Mazahir said,"I am still not associated with any of the Tariqah (orders) how can i make you my murid?". Qazi Mazahir kept on repeating himself, but the stranger was very firm about his commitment. At last Hazra Qazi Mazahir Imam went to Shah-e-ata to become his disciple. When he entered the Khanqah Shah-e-ata was sitting on the Sajjada, waiting for him. Shah-e-ata had already taken out the Shijra (the chain depicting the name of all the Sufis in the order) and signed the Khilafatnama (a certificate giving permission to the disciple to propagate the order further) to be given to him.
Once he became the murid of Shah-e-ata he used to visit his master in the Khanqah everyday on foot, covering a distance of five to seven kilometers across mountain and rivers. Shah-e-ata died in 1889 but he kept visiting the shrine of his master until his last day on earth. He died in 1942 and was buried in the Abgila locality of Gaya. His life is a perfect example for the disciples of all the Sufis. He never called the descendants of shah-e-ata by their name even when one of the great grandsons of Shah-e-ata was his son-in-law. His disciples were innumerable and was present all over India. He founded his own Khanqah which is famous as Khanqah mazahirya and is still in existence. He had three sons Qazi Maqbool Imam, Qazi Waris Imam, and Qazi Jalil Imam. All three of them went on to become great Sufis of their time. His youngest son died in 1992. The orders of his eldest and youngest son are no longer in existence, but the order of his second son and many of his Caliph is still present.
Syed Shah Qazi Najam Imam Chishti Monami Razzaqi is the grandson of Qazi Maqbool Imam-the eldest son of Qazi Mazahir Imam and the present Sajjadanasheen of Khanqah Mazahirya founded by Qazi Mazahir Imam.He has Khilafat (Ijazah) from Qazi Waris Imam (the second son of Qazi Mazahir Imam) and Amir-ul-Mashaiq-the successor and Sajjadanasheen of the Khanqah of Shah-e-Ata. In fact, he has taken thorough spiritual lessons from Amir-ul-Mashaiq and has become his murid (disciple).
Syed Shah Nudrat Hussain Burdawani.
He was already the Sajjada nashin of his ancestral Khanqah established at Burdwan, West Bengal. His was ordered spiritually from his ancestors to go to Gaya and become the disciple of Shah-e-ata. He became his very obedient disciple and started living in the Khanqah of Shah-e-ata. Meanwhile he wrote the "Malfoozat"(sayings of a Sufi) of Shah-e-ata in forty lessons and got it checked and signed by the master himself. After completing his sulook he went to Burdwan. After his death he was buried in his own Khanqah at Burdwan, West Bengal. His son Zia-ul-Hassan was a famous Sufi of his time. His khanqah and the order is still in existence. Syed Shah Fazl-ur-Rahman Razzaqi is the grandson of Shah Zia-ul-Hassan and the present Sajjada nashin of the Khanqah.
Other notable Sufis.
Shah-e-Ata had hundreds of Khulfas all over Asia. This is a small list of notable Sufis who had KhilafatIjazah from him.
This is an incomplete list, it only contains the name of one disciple per city. No Sufi who was the descendant of his son or daughter has been listed.

Paul Swan

Paul Swan (Lakota: Maǧáska, 1838? – September 30, 1900) was a prominent Minneconjou Lakota headman on the Cheyenne River Reservation.
Early life.
Born about 1838, he was the son of the influential headman Chief White Swan, one of six hereditary chiefs of the Minneconjou (a.k.a. Howoju or Owoju) 1866. White Bull later recalled that the elder White Swan "in particular hated the whites."
By the time of the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, however, White Swan's position had moderated and he had settled at the Cheyenne River Agency on the Missouri River. His sons, however, including Paul Swan a.k.a. Little Swan, Fine Weather and Puts on His Shoes, remained out with the non-treaty bands. Paul fought at the Battle of Rosebud and the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Following the death of his father in 1877, Paul Swan assumed the leadership role of his family band.
Cheyenne River Reservation.
It is uncertain when Paul Swan and his brothers surrendered at the Cheyenne River Agency. They may have come in with the large number of Minneconjou who surrendered in the spring of 1877 or they could have gone to Canada with Sitting Bull and not returned until the surrenders in 1881-82. By 1886, Paul Swan was living at Cheyenne River.
In 1881, the Minneconjou leadership gathered at Cheyenne River to select new slcapshirt wearers, symbols of leadership among the Lakota. With only three of the original chieftains still living, the tribe decided to select replacements. Paul Swan was selected to fill the vacancy of his father. Other headman selected included Touch the Clouds, White Bull, Big Crow and Touch the Bear.
Paul Swan received an allotment in the Cherry Creek area of South Dakota where he raised his family. He died September 30, 1900.

<doc id="20445533" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20445533" title="Actinocerida">
Actinocerida

The Actinocerida comprise an order of generally straight, medium to large cephalopods that lived during the early and middle Paleozoic, distinguished by a siphuncle composed of expanded segments that extend into the adjacent chambers, in which deposits formed within contain a system of radial canals and a narrow space along the inner side of the connecting ring known as a paraspatium. (Teichert 1964) Septal necks are generally short and cyrtochoanitic, some being recumbent, some hook shaped. Most grew to lengths of about 60 to 90 cm ( 2-3 ft) but some, like the Huroniidae of the Silurian grew significantly larger. 
Ecology.
The Actinocerida inhabited shallow to quite deep waters, where they alternated between swimming and lying on the bottom. They were predatory, and able to control their buoyancy to a greater degree than their contemporaries.
Derivation.
The derivation of the Actinocerida remains enigmatic.They first appear late in the Early Ordovician (Cassinian Stage, late Floian) with the Georginidae but don't become well established until the beginning of the early Whiterockian Stage (Dapingian) of the Middle Ordovician (Flower 1868,1976) 
The Georginidae, introduced and described by Mary Wade in 1977 (Wade 1988)., based on te genus Georgina, are known from the upper Canadian Coolibah Formation of the Georgina Basin in Northern Australia.How the Georginidae relate to older stocks is unclear. The Upper Cambrian Protactinocerida have been suggested as being ancestral but none are known to have gone beyond the near end the Cambrian extinction, which makes any connection hypothetical. 
Polydesmia was once thought to be the ancestral form of the actinocerids, and was derived from the ellesmeroceriid "Bathmoceras". (Flower 1968). However it turned out (Flower 1976) based on a reassessment of Lower Ordovician and Whiterockian formations in northeastern China that "Polydesmia" is predated by "Wutinoceras", its assumed primitive nature rather a derived condition.
Evolution and diversification.
Actinocerids first appeared early in the Middle Ordovician, with the exception of the Georginidae which are known from the Cassinian in Northern Australia. They reached their greatest diversity in the Middle Ordovician with more than 20 genera, then declined somewhat in the Late Ordovician and more so in the Early Silurian; made a slight come back in the Middle Silurian but not to Late Ordovician numbers; declined more or less steadily from the Late Silurian into the Devonian 
Three major lineages began the Middle Ordovician, the Actinoceratidae, Armenoceratidae, and Ormoceratidae. The Actinoceratidae and Armenoceratidae are most likely derived from "Wutinoceras" and the Ormoceratidae from a second wutinocerid genus, "Adamsoceras". "Gonioceras" is an offshoot of an early Armenoceras; "Lambeoceras" and "Huronia" are offshoots of a later "Actinoceras". (Flower 1968) . 
The Actinoceratidae extent into the Lower Silurian with "Actinoceras"; the Armenoceratidae and Huroniidae into the Upper Silurian. The Ormoceratidae are possible the most recent, extending into the Lower Devonian "Gonioceras" (Gonioceratidae) is limited to the Middle Ordovician, its quasi-lookalike "Lambeoceras" (Lamberoceratidae) to the uppermost Middle and Upper Ordovician. The wutinocerids are known only from the early Middle Ordovician (Whiterockian) and the polydesmiadids are restricted to about that time.
Originating in the Ordovician, by the Devonian period Actinocerids became rare; perhaps they were unable to compete with the more compact and maneuverable coiled nautiloids and ammonoids and cope with the arrival of jawed fish. 
Classification and taxonomy.
The Actinocerida contains nine families; the Georginidae, Wutinoceratidae, Polydesmiidae, Armenoceratidae, Ormoceratidae, Actinoceratidae, Gonioceratidae, Lambeoceratide, and Huroniidae. The Carbactinoceratidae, included in the taxonomy in the Treatise, (Vol K) have been removed to the Pseudorthocerida (Kroger and Mapes, 2007)

Agabus (beetle)

Agabus is a large genus of predatory aquatic beetles in the family Dytiscidae, proposed in 1817 by William Elford Leach and named after Agabus, an early follower of Christianity. The adult beetles are moderate-sized, 5 to 14 mm long. The genus is primarily Holarctic in distribution, with only a few species known from the Afrotropic and Neotropic realms. Three species of "Agabus", namely "A. clypealis", "A. discicollis" and "A. hozgargantae" are endangered according to the IUCN Red List. The division into subgenera is not widely accepted. However, a number of species groups are recognized after the works of David J. Larson and Anders N. Nilsson. The genus is probably polyphyletic or paraphyletic. In a recent study of mitochondrial DNA, "Agabus" was found paraphyletic with respect to several of the species groups of "Platambus", a closely related genus in the tribe Agabini. Lately the taxonomy of the genus has been revised, and some groups of species were transferred from "Agabus" "sensu stricto" to other genera in the tribe Agabini.
"Agabus" contains the following species:

Halloween around the world

"Halloween" is a celebration observed on 31 October, primarily in regions of the Western world; the traditions and importance of the celebration vary significantly between geographical areas.
Halloween is a time of celebration and superstition. It is thought to have originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off roaming ghosts.
Origins.
Halloween or Hallowe'en is derived from "All Hallows' Eve", the eve or vigil before the Western Christian feast of All Hallows (or All Saints) which is observed on 1 November. Halloween begins the triduum of Hallowmas.
Asia.
China.
The more commercialized event is celebrated by expatriate Americans or Canadians. Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park (Halloween Bash) host annual Halloween shows. Lan Kwai Fong bars will be decked out with Halloween decorations to lure ex-pats and locals interest in Halloween.
Traditional "door-to-door" trick or treating is not commonly practiced in Hong Kong due to the vast majority of Hong Kong residents living in high-rise apartment blocks. The only instances of street-level trick or treating to be found in Hong Kong occur in ultra-exclusive gated housing communities such as The Beverly Hills populated by Hong Kong's super-rich. For the general public, there are events at Tsim Sha Tsui's Avenue of the Stars that try to mimic the celebration.
Mainland China has been less influenced by Anglo traditions than Hong Kong and Halloween is generally considered "foreign." As Halloween has become more popular globally it has also become more popular in China, however, particularly amongst children attending private or international schools with many foreign teachers.
Japan.
Halloween arrived only recently in Japan, mainly in the context of American pop culture. Western-style Halloween decorations such as jack-o'-lanterns can be seen in many locations, and places such as Tokyo Disneyland and Universal Studios Japan put on special Halloween events. The wearing of elaborate costumes at night is recently very popular in areas such as Amerikamura in Osaka and Kobe where, in October 2012, about 1700 people dressed in costumes take part in the Halloween Festival.
Philippines.
In Philippines, Halloween is celebrated as All Saints Day, immediately followed by All Souls day ("Araw ng Patay")on 1 November.
Trick-or treating is gradually replacing the tradition of "Pangangaluluwà", a local version of the old English custom of souling. Some provinces in the Philippines still celebrates "Pangangaluluwa" by forming a group that will go house to house and offer a song in exchange for money or food. But like other traditions, this tradition is starting to fade. The custom had Filipino children singing carols about the souls in Purgatory and asking for "abúloy" (alms for the deceased) to pay for Masses for the dead. Along with the requested alms, householders sometimes gave the children "súman" (rice cake). During the night various small items, such as items of clothing, plants, etc., would "mysteriously" disappear, only to be discovered the next morning in the yard, or in the middle of the street. In older times, it was believed that during Halloween, spirits of loved ones visit and manifest their visit by taking an item.
Singapore.
Singapore Chinese celebrates "Zhong Yuan Jie / Yu Lan Jie" (Hungry Ghosts Festival, some sort of Chinese Halloween) during lunar seventh month. It is believed that the gates of hell are opened and the spirits come back to visit their families. Throughout the month, there will be Chinese Opera and live music performances on a temporary setup stage and outdoor banquet dinner near the stage in various districts of Singapore. These performances and banquets are funded by residents of the individual district.
In recent years, Halloween celebration is becoming more and more popular in Singapore, with influences from the west and probably the fun element of Halloween. In 2011, netizens are raging because Wildlife Reserves Singapore decided to cancel its Halloween event. In 2012, there are over 19 major Halloween celebration events around Singapore. In 2013, Universal Studios Singapore Halloween Horror Nights is coming back for the third time. Sentosa Spooktacular is back for the fifth time since 2009. Museum of Horrors is back for the fourth time.
Australia.
Halloween is growing in momentum in Australia, in spite of seasonal differences and the transition from spring to summer. Criticisms stem largely from the fact that Halloween has little relevance to Australian culture. It is also considered, by some Australians, to be an unwanted American influence; as although Halloween does have Celtic/European origins, its increasing popularity in Australia is largely as a result of American pop-culture influence. Supporters of the event claim that the critics fail to see that the event is not entirely American, but rather Celtic and is no different to embracing other cultural traditions such as Saint Patrick's Day (an Irish tradition).
Europe.
Halloween is more successful and partially ousting some older customs like the "Rübengeistern" (turnip ghosts), Martinisingen and others. The University of Graz undertook a research project about Halloween led by Editha Hörandner. According to her, the often heard claims of Celtic or pagan origin is used as a sort of "quality brand" ("Gütesiegel") for the authenticity of the tradition.
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, vignesh Halloween was not celebrated until recently. For the past few years, it has been popular among younger generations. Halloween is a work day in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since wearing masks has become highly popular among children and teenagers, e.g. in many Bosnian schools, both elementary as well as high schools (gymnasiums and vocational), students will usually wear costumes and masks on Halloween. There it is called "Noć vještica" (English translation: "Night of Witches").
Germany.
Halloween was not generally observed in Germany prior to the 1990s, in part due to the opposition of the Lutheran Church. It has been increasing in popularity, however, with a fifth of Germans now telling pollsters they celebrate Halloween. Halloween has been associated with the influence of U.S. culture, and "Trick or Treating" (in German,"Süßes oder Saures") has been occurring in some areas such as the Dahlem neighborhood in Berlin, which was part of the American zone during the Cold War. Complaints of vandalism associated with Halloween "Tricks" have increasing, particular from many elderly Germans unfamiliar with "Trick or Treating."
Ireland.
On Halloween night, adults and children dress up as creatures from the underworld (e.g., ghosts, ghouls, zombies, witches, and goblins), light bonfires, and enjoy spectacular fireworks displays – in particular, the city of Derry is home to the largest organized Halloween celebration on the island, in the form of a street carnival and fireworks display.
Games are often played, such as bobbing for apples, in which apples, peanuts, and other nuts and fruit and some small coins are placed in a basin of water. The apples and nuts float, but the coins, which sink, are harder to catch. Everyone takes turns catching as many items possible using only their mouths. In some households, the coins are embedded in the fruit for the children to "earn" as they catch each apple. Another common game involves the hands-free eating of an apple hung on a string attached to the ceiling. Games of divination are also played at Halloween, but are becoming less popular. Lunchtime (the midday meal, sometimes called "dinner" in Ireland), on Halloween is called Colcannon.
Halloween is today associated with anti-social behaviour with 31 October being the busiest day of the year for the Emergency Services. Bangers and fireworks are illegal in the Republic of Ireland; however, they are commonly smuggled in from Northern Ireland where they are legal. Bonfires are frequently built around Halloween. Trick-or-treating is popular amongst children on 31 October and Halloween parties and events are commonplace.
Romania.
Halloween in Romania is celebrated around the myth of "Dracula" on 31 October. The spirit of Dracula is believed to live there because the town was the site of many witch trials; these are recreated today by actors on the night of Halloween.
The most successful Halloween Party in Transylvania is taken place in Sighisoara, the citadel where Vlad the Impaler (aka Dracula) was born. The prestigious Fodor's travel guide placed Halloween in Transylvania in a list of Top Ten Must-Do-Adventures. However, regarding the fact that Dracula is a fictional character created by Bram Stoker, this should not be considered a tradition in Romania. See "Day of the Dead".During this tradition people light up candles in the cemetery, on the shrines of their close relatives and loved ones who have passed away.
Sardinia.
In the town of Gadoni 2 November torches, constituted by sheafs of asphodel stems long, are brought through the streets of the town by the young people at the dusk. The meaning of this ritual is that one of accompany the wandering souls and the spirits far from the town. Out of the windows are put sas Concas de Mortu (Head of the deads), carved pumpkins that look like skulls, with inside a candle.
Switzerland.
In Switzerland, Halloween, after first becoming popular in 1999 is on the wane. Switzerland already has a "festival overload" and even though Swiss people like to dress up for any occasion, they do prefer a traditional element. 
United Kingdom.
England.
There are certain customs associated with All Saints' Day (All Hallows Day) and All Souls' Day. In the past, on All Souls' Eve families would stay up late, and little "soul cakes" were eaten. At the stroke of midnight, there was solemn silence among households, which had candles burning in every room to guide the souls back to visit their earthly homes and a glass of wine on the table to refresh them. The tradition of giving soul cakes that originated in Great Britain and Ireland was known as souling, often seen as the origin of modern trick or treating in North America, and souling continued in parts of England as late as the 1930s, with children going from door to door singing songs and saying prayers for the dead in return for cakes or money.
There has been concern about the potential for antisocial behaviour, particularly among older teenagers, on Halloween. Cases of houses being "egg-bombed" or having lit fireworks posted through the letterbox (especially when the occupants do not give money or gifts) have been reported, and the BBC reported that for Halloween 2006, police forces stepped up patrols to respond to such mischief.
Scotland.
The name "Halloween" is first attested in the 16th century as a Scottish shortening of the fuller "All-Hallows-Even", that is, the night before All Hallows Day. All observances of Halloween made an application to the agency of evil spirits, and Dumfries poet John Mayne's 1780 poem made note of pranks at Halloween; ""What fearfu' pranks ensue!"", as well as the supernatural associated with the night, ""Bogies"" (ghosts). Eminent Scottish poet Rabbie Burns was influenced by Maynes composition, and portrayed some of the customs in his poem "Halloween" (1785). According to Burns, Halloween is "thought to be a night when witches, devils, and other mischief-making beings are all abroad on their baneful midnight errands".
Traditional customs and lore include divination practices, ways of trying to predict the future. By the 18th century, most of the customs were methods for young people to search for their future husbands or wives. A traditional Scottish form of divining one's future spouse is to carve an apple in one long strip, then toss the peel over one's shoulder. The peel is believed to land in the shape of the first letter of the future spouse's name.
If children approached the door of a house, they were given offerings of food (Halloween being a harvest festival), which served to ward off the potential spirits that may lurk among them. The children's practice of "guising" (derived from "disguising"), going from door to door in supernatural-themed costumes for food or coins, is a traditional Halloween custom in Scotland and Ireland. Among the earliest record of Guising at Halloween in Scotland is in 1895, where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of scooped out turnips, visit homes to be rewarded with cakes, fruit and money.
A traditional Halloween game includes apple "dooking", or "dunking" or (i.e., retrieving one from a bucket of water using only one's mouth), and attempting to eat, while blindfolded, a treacle/jam-coated scone hanging on a piece of string. In some places, apple-dunking has been replaced (because of fears of contracting saliva-borne illnesses in the water) by standing over the bowl holding a fork in one's mouth and releasing it in an attempt to skewer an apple using only gravity.
Canada and United States.
Halloween is largely celebrated in the same manner in English-speaking Canada and the United States. In the United States, where lingering Puritan tradition restricted the observance of many holidays, Halloween did not become a holiday until the 19th century. American almanacs of the late 18th and early 19th centuries do not include Halloween in their lists of holidays. The transatlantic migration of nearly two million Irish following the Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849) finally brought the holiday to the United States. Scottish emigration, primarily to Canada before 1870 and to the United States thereafter, brought the Scottish version of the holiday to each country. The earliest known reference to ritual begging on Halloween in English speaking North America occurs in 1911, when a newspaper in Kingston, Ontario reported that it was normal for the smaller children to go street "guising" on Halloween between 6 and 7 p.m., visiting shops and neighbors to be rewarded with nuts and candies for their rhymes and songs.
American librarian and author Ruth Edna Kelley wrote the first book length history of the holiday in the U.S; "The Book of Hallowe'en" (1919), and references souling in the chapter "Hallowe'en in America"; "All Hallowe'en customs in the United States are borrowed directly or adapted from those of other countries. The taste in Hallowe'en festivities now is to study old traditions, and hold a Scotch party, using Robert Burns's poem "Halloween" as a guide; or to go a-souling as the English used. In short, no custom that was once honored at Hallowe'en is out of fashion now". The main event for children and teenagers of modern Halloween in the United States and Canada is trick-or-treating, in which children, teenagers, (sometimes) young adults, and parents (accompanying their children) disguise themselves in costumes and go door to door in their neighborhoods, ringing each doorbell and yelling "Trick or treat!" to solicit a gift of candy or similar items.
At the turn of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with destruction of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the Boy Scouts, Boys Clubs, and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on this night. 
The commercialization of Halloween in the United States did not start until the 20th century, beginning perhaps with Halloween postcards (featuring hundreds of designs), which were most popular between 1905 and 1915. Dennison Manufacturing Company (which published its first Halloween catalog in 1909) and the Beistle Company were pioneers in commercially made Halloween decorations, particularly die-cut paper items. German manufacturers specialised in Halloween figurines that were exported to the United States in the period between the two World Wars.
Halloween is now the United States' second most popular holiday (after Christmas) for decorating; the sale of candy and costumes is also extremely common during the holiday, which is marketed to children and adults alike. The National Confectioners Association (NCA) reported in 2005 that 80 percent of American adults planned to give out candy to trick-or-treaters.
The NCA reported in 2005 that 93 percent of children planned to go trick-or-treating. According to the National Retail Federation, the most popular Halloween costume themes for adults are, in order: witch, pirate, vampire, cat, and clown. Each year, popular costumes are dictated by various current events and pop culture icons. On many college campuses, Halloween is a major celebration, with the Friday and Saturday nearest 31 October hosting many costume parties.
City parades.
Madison, Wisconsin, home of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, hosts one of the more infamous annual Halloween celebrations. Due to the large influx of out-of-towners crowding the State Street area, riots have broken out in recent years, resulting in the use of mounted police and tear gas to disperse the crowds. Likewise, Chapel Hill, NC, site of the University of North Carolina, has a notorious downtown street party which in 2007 drew a crowd estimated at 80,000 on downtown Franklin Street, in a town with a population of just 54,000. In 2008, in an effort to curb the influx of out-of-towners, mayor Kevin Foy emplaced measures to make commuting downtown more difficult on Halloween.
Wilmington, North Carolina had Front Street (down town) barricaded off to allow crowds of costumed Halloween spectators and visitors to mingle in 2010. One member of the crowd started chanting "USA", and the Wilmington Police Department swiftly pepper-sprayed the unsuspecting crowd. Lt Ed Pigford of Wilmington PD is quoted as saying "we're trying to avoid injury by trying to split these crowds up as quickly as we can". With pepper spray.
Saint Helena.
In Saint Helena, Halloween is actively celebrated, largely along the American model, with ghosts, skeletons, devils, vampires, witches and the like. Imitation pumpkins are used instead of real pumpkins because the pumpkin harvesting season in Saint Helena's hemisphere is not near Halloween. Trick-or-treating is widespread. Party venues provide entertainment for adults.

Holy Trinity Church, Guildford

Holy Trinity Church is an Anglican church in the centre of Guildford, England. A large, red brick building, it was built on the site of a mediaeval church which collapsed in the mid-18th century. It is the only large Georgian church in Surrey, sporting detailed frescos of the Crucifixion surrounded by the Saints and the Ascended Lord in Heaven, as well as one of the largest unsupported ceilings in southern England. From 1927, when the diocese of Guildford was created, until 1961, when the current cathedral was consecrated, it served as pro-cathedral. Today it forms part of the town centre parish of Holy Trinity and Saint Mary's.
History.
Construction and development.
The original, mediaeval church was similar in plan to the surviving Saint Mary's. Its date of construction is unknown, although the list of rectors goes back to 1304. It may have been a Norman foundation. It is believed that Henry I granted the living to Merton Priory, which retained it until the Dissolution.
Weston Chapel.
The "Weston Chapel" stands attached to the south side of the main church. Its external walls are of a decorative chequerboard pattern of flint and freestone squares. It was built c.1540 by Richard Weston (1465–1541) of nearby Sutton Place, primarily as his intended burial place, as his will, dated 15 May 1541<National Archives PROB 11/29>, directs that his body be: 
"buryed in the P'yshe Churche of the Holy Trinitye with in the Town of Guldforde in a Chapell
which I have caused to be made for the same iyntent" 
The Chantry established and funded by Weston is listed in the "Survey of Chantry Lands, Surrey"
made between 1546 and 1548 as part of the administering of the Dissolution of the Monasteries as being:
"For the mayneteyninge of one priest and one yerely "obite" for the terme of xx ti (i.e.20) yeares begyninge the xx th day of June in the xxxii yere (1541) of the reigne of our late sovereign lorde Kinge Henry the eight. The incumbent whereof is Anthony Cawsey clerke of the
age of l (i.e.50) yeres...which said chauntrey and "obite" are worth lands and
tenements by the yere x li (i.e. £20) whereof to the pore xxvii s iiii d. (i.e. 27 shillings & 4 pence) and so remayneth clere viii li iiii d (i.e. £8 4d) plate parcel gilt viii oz di. Qrt. xlii s iii d Ornamentes x li."
The Weston family maintained their Catholic faith throughout the Reformation and beyond, which was a great sacrifice for them as it prevented them from holding public office and brought much suspicion on them from government officials throughout the ages. The freehold of the Weston Chapel was retained by descendants of the Weston family until 2005, when the trustees of the Weston Estate granted it to the main Protestant Church of Holy Trinity to which it has been physically attached since 1763. Part of the arrangement was that a Catholic mass be held in the Chapel at least annually. There are three surviving Weston monuments in the chapel. Two are wall tablets, the earliest of which commemorates Melior Mary Weston(d.1782) of Sutton Place, the last direct descendant of the founder and only child and sole heiress of John II Weston(d.1730) and Elizabeth Gage, sister of Thomas Gage, 1st Viscount Gage. The tablet was erected by her grateful distant Catholic cousin John Webbe-Weston(d.1823) to whom she bequeathed all her estates, including Sutton Place. The other tablet is for Elizabeth Lawson, who died in 1791 aged 34, first wife of John Webbe-Weston. The other Weston Monument which once stood in the centre of the Weston Chapel but now stands in the west porch of the main church is the chest tomb of Anne Pickering(d.1582), wife of Sir Francis Weston the only son of the founder who was executed in 1536 aged only 25 for supposed adultery with Queen Anne Boleyn. Although she remarried, she expressed the wish in her will to be buried near her first father-in-law. Francis, having been beheaded in the Tower of London, was buried in an unmarked tomb within the precincts of the Tower. The effigy is of a recumbent woman wearing a ruff and lies on a chest tomb sculpted with skulls showing behind a grill.
Collapse of 1740.
In 1740 the steeple collapsed, destroying most of the building. The only part of the church building that survives today is the Weston Chapel. Some external features such as the iron railings also remain from the earlier building, as do two monuments. A new red brick church was erected to the designs of James Horne on the site of the original church and opened in 1763. The architecture has been described as "handsome and pedestrian at the same time", being of correct classical proportions but with details that are under-scale for such a large building on an important site. Holy Trinity is the only large 18th-century place of worship in Surrey and stands in a commanding position at the top of Guildford's High Street. In the mid-19th century the interior of the church was altered extensively. In 1869 Woodyer replaced the double rows of windows with single rows. The side galleries were removed in 1867. The Victorian emphasis on ritual and sacrament called for a larger chancel, and in 1886 the church was enlarged at the east end, creating the present choir, sanctuary, side chapel and organ chamber. The church is now effectively one huge room with tripartite openings at the east end, allowing access to the chancel and the two side chapels. The central feature of the decoration of the apse is 'the Presence of the Crucified in the Church of all ages': Christ upon the cross is flanked by Aaron, David, and Isaiah on the north side, and Saints Paul, Stephen, and Augustine of Hippo on the south side, representing respectively the priests, kings and prophets of the Jewish Church and the apostles, martyrs and bishops of the Christian Church. Other alterations have taken place throughout the 20th century. The wrought iron choir screen dates from 1927, when Holy Trinity became pro-cathedral. The organ has undergone substantial movement and alteration over the years, culminating in complete renovations in 1977 and 1997.
Features inside the church include the tomb of George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1611 to 1633 and founder of Abbot's Hospital, which stands opposite the church, and a memorial to Arthur Onslow, former Speaker of the House of Commons.
The church also has a ring of eight bells hung for change ringing. Four of the bells date from 1769, cast by Lester, Pack & Chapman, with the others having been cast in 1912 by John Taylor & Co.
Pro-Cathedral.
As a response to the increasing population of south-east England, the diocese of Winchester was divided into three sections in 1927. The Congé d'Elire for this purpose was held in the Weston Chapel. Holy Trinity Church was initially used as the cathedral for the new Diocese of Guildford, but it was judged too small for the task, and in 1928 the diocese decided to build a new cathedral. Work began on the new cathedral in 1933, but the Second World War delayed the construction considerably, and it was not consecrated until 1961, although services had been held in the crypt since 1947. In the intervening years Holy Trinity Church served as pro-cathedral.
Holy Trinity Church today.
Worship.
The style of worship at Holy Trinity Church falls within the liberal tradition of the Church of England. There are usually two services, a Sung Eucharist (Common Worship) and Evensong (Book of Common Prayer), on a Sunday. Morning Prayer is said every weekday. Sunday worship is led by the forty-strong choir, which is unusual in being a parish church choir which retains an all-boys treble line.
Holy Trinity is Guildford's civic church, where the installation of each new Mayor and the town's annual Act of Remembrance is celebrated. It also serves as the venue for regular musical events.
The parish of Holy Trinity and Saint Mary's has links with the Diocese of Highveld in South Africa, and a group of parishioners travelled to the Highveld in 2008.

Renewable energy in Norway

Norway is a heavy producer of renewable energy, first of all due to good resources in hydropower. Over 99% of the electricity production in mainland Norway is covered by hydropower plants. The total production of electricity from hydropower plants amounted to 135.3 TWh in 2007 There is also a large potential in wind power, offshore wind power and wave power, as well as production of bio-energy from wood. Norway has limited resources in solar energy, but is one of the world's largest producers of solar grade silicon and silicon solar cells, much thanks to the activities of Renewable Energy Corporation.
Guarantees of Origin, the system for Guarantees of Origin was implemented by the EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC. In 2010 the average electricity consumption mix of a Norwegian household was only 36% renewable.
Wind power.
In 2012 Norway had a wind power electricity production of 1.6 GWh. It aims to triple its capacity of currently ca.700 MW to 2GW by 2020.
Transport.
In the transport sector the share of renewables has increased from 1.3% to 4% between 2005-2010, and currently Norway has one of the highest numbers of electric cars per capita in the world.

A fullback, Stevenson was capped 15 times for Scotland and took part in six Home Nations campaigns. This included being part of Scotland's 1891 Home Nations Triple Crown winning side as well as the team which were joint winners with England the previous Championship. The only points of his career were scored through a drop goal in a win against Wales at Edinburgh during their Triple Crown year.
On the cricket field Stevenson was a slow underarm bowler and right-handed batsman. He appeared in five first-class matches between 1901 and 1905, once for the PF Warner's XI, another with HDG Leveson-Gower's XI, twice for the Marylebone Cricket Club and once with Scotland.

Ria de Vigo

Vigo Ria () is an estuary in Galicia, Spain. It is the southern most ria of the Rías Baixas. It is located south of the province of Pontevedra, and extends in northeast direction over a length of 35 km from its mouth at Cape Silleiro to the deepest point in Arcade, with a maximum width of 7 km, and is narrowest in the Strait of Rande at 700 m. Its western entrance is protected by the Cies Islands, which are part of the National Park of the Atlantic Islands, within the islands of Toralla and San Simon. Its borders the north with Morrazo Peninsula. In the extreme south lies the Bay of Bayona. Its easy access, deep draft and calm waters make the Vigo estuary an ideal retreat for sailing and water sports.
From the environmental point of view, it is a bay with a biologically richness because of its crop water currents and deep cold waters from the north, carrying large quantities of nutrients. Historically, the Vigo estuary area has been good for fishing and shellfishing, although current conditions are not ideal due to high human and industrial pressure on coastal waterfront.
On its banks stood the city of Vigo. The municipalities of Baiona, Nigrán, Redondela, Soutomaior, Vilaboa, Moaña and Cangas de Morrazo are also situated here. It has a total population of about 420,000 inhabitants.
The Battle of Rande developed here on October 23, 1702, more precisely at the end of the estuary, in the Ensenada de San Simón. The following German U-Boats are reported to have been sunk somewhere in the ria: the U-523, sunk August 25, 1943 (17 dead and 37 survivors), and the U-506, sunk at 15:50 hrs on July 12, 1943 (48 dead and six survivors).

WOMAC

The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. The WOMAC has also been used to assess back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and fibromyalgia. It can be self-administered and was developed at Western Ontario and McMaster Universities in 1982.
The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0–20), two for stiffness (score range 0–8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0–68). Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties.
A WOMAC test takes about 12 minutes, but is also available in a short form, (although this has not been as extensively tested as the full version). Versions of the WOMAC have also been developed that can be used in telephone or online surveys.
The WOMAC is among the most widely used assessments in arthritis research. For example, it appears as a search keyword in more than 1500 papers cataloged in PubMed, as of June, 2012. It has been translated into more than 65 languages.
The American College of Rheumatology notes that the test-retest reliability of the WOMAC varies for the pain, stiffness, and function subscales. The ACR says the pain subscale "has been variable across studies but generally meets the minimum standard." Reliability for the physical function scale "has been more consistent and stronger... but the stiffness subscale has shown low test-retest reliability." When used in clinical studies, the WOMAC pain and function subscales perform comparably or better than other tests in being responsive to change from experimental interventions, but this varies for the different subscales and types of intervention.
An example of an arthritis study using the WOMAC found a significant dose-response relationship between 10% body weight loss (or gain) and clinically significant improvements (or declines) in WOMAC function and pain for people with osteoarthritis of the knee.

James and Lister Lea was an architectural and property consultancy firm active in the England between 1846 and 2001. Established by brothers James Lea and Lister Lea, the partnership was initially focussed only on architecture. Together, the brothers designed buildings across Birmingham, England, with a heavy focus on public houses, especially towards the end of the 19th century and early 20th century. Later in the firm's existence, it changed its name to James and Lister Lea and Sons. On 2 January 2001, the property consultancy firm merged with Bruton Knowles to produce a combined workforce of approximately 300 people.
The firm had offices on Bull Street, Birmingham and Knowle, although the Knowle office was sold in 1999 to agricultural surveyors Smith-Woolley. In May 2000, James and Lister Lea revealed that they were looking at rebranding the company in the future. In December 2000, Bruton Knowles and James and Lister Lea agreed a merger that would become effective on 2 January 2001. The merger, which did not involve any exchange of money between the two companies, led to the formation of one of the largest property consultancy firms in Birmingham.
As an architectural practice, the firm has been responsible for some of Birmingham's most recognisable public houses, many of which are now listed buildings.

Tony Parry

Anthony John "Tony" Parry (8 September 1945 – 23 November 2009) was an English former footballer who made nearly 200 appearances in the Football League playing as a central defender for Hartlepool United, Derby County and Mansfield Town.
Parry was born in Burton upon Trent. He was Brian Clough's first signing as manager of Hartlepool. He was a mainstay of the side which won promotion from the Fourth Division in the 1967–68 season, and won the club's inaugural Player of the Year award.
In 1972 the club was on the brink of going out of business, needing to sell a player to survive, when Clough, by then manager of Derby County, bid £2,500 for the player. It is usually regarded as a philanthropic gesture by Clough (albeit using Derby's money) as Parry made few appearances for Derby before moving on to Mansfield Town.
He later played non-league football for Gresley Rovers, where he was Player of the Year in the 1982–83 season.
Parry died suddenly on 23 November 2009, following a short battle with pneumonia.
In February 2009, Parry made a triumphant return to the North East as guest of honour at Hartlepool United's centenary dinner.
Barry Butlin, Secretary & Treasurer of Derby County Former Players' Association, said: "It is fitting that Tony's fans at Hartlepool and in the North East had the opportunity to honour him at the 'Centenary' celebrations, and Tony was delighted to be greeted by his telly idol Jeff Stelling."

<doc id="20446105" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20446105" title="Marine Optical Buoy">
Marine Optical Buoy

The Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) measures light at and very near the sea surface in a specific location over a long period of time, serving as part of an ocean color observation system. Satellites are another component of the system, providing global coverage through remote sensing; however, satellites measure light above the Earth's atmosphere, becoming subject to interference from the atmosphere itself and other light sources. The Marine Optical Buoy helps alleviate that interference and thus improve the quality of the overall ocean color observation system.
Physical description.
MOBY is a buoy 15 meters tall floating vertically in the water with approximately 3 meters above the surface and 12 meters below. A float canister is at water level, measuring approximately 2 meters high and 1.5 meters in diameter above the water, 1 meter in diameter below the water. Above the float canister are four solar panels and an antenna column. From the bottom of the float canister, a central column descends to a 2-meter-high, 1-meter-diameter instrument canister. Along the central column are three standoff arms measuring 3 meters long, 2.5 meters long, and 2 meters long, respectively. The standoff arms can be relocated up and down the central column during maintenance. Light collectors are at the ends of the standoff arms and at the top of the antenna column. The antenna column includes Global Positioning System (GPS), very high frequency (VHF), and cellular telephone antennas. Computers, communications, and control electronics occupy the float canister. A marine optical system (MOS), a power system, and batteries occupy the instrument canister. The MOS includes spectrographs with charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors, an optical multiplexer, and fiber optic sensor lines to the light collectors.
MOBY has a tether to another buoy that is moored to the sea floor at a depth of about 1200 meters. MOBY is located at , west of Lanai, in the lee of the Hawaiian Islands.
Function.
Light from the Sun crosses space, enters and travels through the Earth's atmosphere, then enters the Earth's oceans. In the atmosphere and in the oceans, this light reflects from, refracts around, and absorbs into molecules and other objects. Some of this light leaves the water to again travel through the atmosphere and out into space, carrying the color of whatever it struck.
At the sea surface, light coming down through the atmosphere enters the collector at the top of MOBY's antenna column. Each of MOBY's three submerged standoff arms has a pair of light collectors: one on top of the arm to collect downward moving light; and one underneath the arm to collect upward moving reflected light. Light entering the collectors travels through optical fibers and the optical multiplexer to the CCD detectors and spectrographs. The spectrographs record the light signals, and a computer stores the measurement data. The communications system aboard MOBY daily transmits much of the light measurement data to operators on shore.
There is one Marine Optical Buoy operating in the water, and another in maintenance on shore. Every 3 to 4 months, a team exchanges the two buoys. The team calibrates each MOBY while it is in maintenance, both before deploying the buoy and after recovering it. Additionally, a team visits the MOBY in the water monthly, to clean algae, barnacles, and other organisms off the light collectors; and to generate independent comparison data using portable reference light sources. Each MOBY has internal reference light sources, as well, for continuous but not independent comparison. The MOBY calibration data traces to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) radiometric standards directly, as opposed to using intermediate standards.
Contribution.
MOBY has generated calibrated measurements of ocean color at the sea surface since 1996. MOBY served as the primary sea surface calibration for satellite borne sensors such as the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MOBY has contributed to the calibration of the Ocean Color and Temperature Sensor (OCTS), the Polarization Detection Environmental Radiometer (POLDER), and the Modular Optoelectronic Scanner (IRS1-MOS).
Long term sensors on the sea surface, such as MOBY, help improve the quality of the global ocean color observation system.

Buckhead Atlanta

Buckhead Atlanta, until May 2011 called Streets of Buckhead, is a planned mixed-use development in the Buckhead Community in Atlanta, Georgia. The project is a redevelopment of part of the Buckhead Village neighborhood bounded by Peachtree Rd., E. Paces Ferry Rd., Pharr Rd., and N. Fulton Drive. It is located just from two of the region's most prominent and upscale malls, Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza. 
As of May 2011, San Diego-based OliverMcMillan Inc. purchased the land from Ben Carter Properties and is now developing the project. The project was renamed that same month.
In September, 2011, McMillan announced a further delay in the project, and that construction would not begin until the end of the first quarter of 2012. McMillan intends to invest $300 million to complete the project in which Ben Carter had already invested $400 million. The total planned development now is targeted at 370 apartments, of retail space and of "boutique" office space.
In early 2013 construction began after a hiatus of three years with the first phase of retail expected to open later in the year.
History.
In 1838, Henry Irby purchased 202 1/2 acres surrounding what is now Buckhead Village from Daniel Johnson for $650. Irby subsequently established a general store and tavern at the northwest corner of the Peachtree–Roswell–Paces Ferry intersection. 
To reverse a downturn in the Village during the 1980s, minimum parking spot requirements for bars were lifted, which quickly led to it becoming the most dense concentration of bars and clubs in the city, such as BAR, World Bar, Lulu's Bait Shack, Mako's, Tongue & Groove, Chaos and John Harvard's Brew House. By 1996 Buckhead Village nightlife was like "Mardi Gras, complete with nightly arrests, puking in the streets and college girls".
By the late 1990s the clientele was changing, street cruising and "hanging" was common, and crime was increasing, sometimes violent. To ameliorate the situation, the Atlanta City Council passed an ordinance to close bars at 2:30 a.m. rather than 4 a.m., and liquor licenses were made more difficult to obtain or renew. Most of the bars and nightclubs closed between 2000 and 2007.
In 2006–07, Ben Carter bought parcels in the area in order to develop the Streets of Buckhead. Demolition of existing structures began in August 2007. 
Original plans by developer Ben Carter Properties, LLC called for a $1.5 billion upscale mixed-use development. The Streets of Buckhead was dubbed "Atlanta's new upscale shopping", as it was to feature of exclusive shopping, 14 fine dining restaurants, two four-star hotels, 350 multi-million-dollar condominia and class-A office space. It aimed to be the most exclusive shopping area in the Southern United States.
Originally scheduled for a grand opening of November 2009, by April 2009, work slowdowns pushed the projected opening back to Fall 2011.
On May 2, 2011, San Diego-based OliverMcMillan Inc. purchased the land from Ben Carter Properties. Baupost Group LLC, a Boston hedge fund, is to provide $300 million of new equity. 
OliverMcMillan plans to change much of the original plans: they are "not seeking a Rodeo Drive-type development" and "the level of restaurants and retail might be somewhat different". It is to be an "urban village" woven into the Buckhead Community. 
The preliminary revised plans called for of retail and restaurants, of boutique offices and two 20-story luxury apartment buildings. Plans no longer include the two hotels. Rather than upscale restaurants, the development might target local chefs. A street grid system and street-level cafés and stores are to promote walkability. The first phase might consist of apartments.

Rotliegend

The Rotliegend or Rotliegendes () is a lithostratigraphic unit (a sequence of rock strata) of Cisuralian (early Permian) age that is found in the subsurface of large areas in western and central Europe. The Rotliegend mainly consists of sandstone layers. It is usually covered by the Zechstein and lies on top of regionally different formations of late Carboniferous age.
The name Rotliegend has in the past not only been used to address the rock strata themselves, but also the time span in which they were formed (in which case the Rotliegend was considered a series or subsystem of the Permian). This time span corresponds roughly with the length of the Cisuralian epoch. 
Facies and formation.
In large parts of Pangaea, the last phases of the Hercynian orogeny were still ongoing during the start of the Permian. At the same time local crustal extension formed intramontane basins such as the large Permian Basin which covered parts of present day Germany, Poland, Denmark, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Netherlands. The early development of the basin went hand in hand with volcanism. Apart from these volcanic deposits the basin was filled by the erosional products of the Hercynian mountains to the south: mostly sands and gravels deposited under an arid and warm climate.
Stratigraphy.
In the north of Germany and in the Netherlands the Rotliegend is usually subdivided into two groups: a Lower Rotliegend Group (mostly volcanic rocks: tuffs and basaltic lavas) and an Upper Rotliegend Group (sandstones and siltstones). During the formation of the lower group the basin was still small and the deposition was restricted to the centre of the basin in the southeastern North Sea and northern Germany, this group is very limited in thickness in the Dutch subsurface. The upper group has a larger arial distribution since the basin had grown wider.
In Dutch lithostratigraphy, the Rotliegend lies on top of the late Carboniferous Limburg Group and below the Zechstein Group. The Upper Rotliegend Group is divided in the Silverpit Formation and Slochteren Formation, the last is an important reservoir for hydrocarbons. The German Bentheim Sandstone, which crops out in the Münsterland, is part of the Slochteren Formation.
The Rotliegend of northern Germany is continuous with that of the Netherlands. In other parts of Germany contemporaneous basins exist, such as the Saar-Nahe Basin, the Wetterau or the Saale Basin. The Rotliegend of these different intramontane basins is not easy to correlate and the lithostratigraphy of each basin has its own divisions (groups and formations).

Harvey Brownstone

Harvey Brownstone (born July 24, 1956) is a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice and the first openly gay judge in Canada. He is also a bestselling author and host of a television talk show on matters involving family law.
Early life and education.
Brownstone was born on July 24, 1956 in Paris, France, and was raised in Hamilton, Ontario. He attended Scott Park Secondary School and received his LL.B. degree from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario in 1980 and was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1983 after articling with criminal lawyer Leo Adler.
Career.
Brownstone worked as a Legal Aid duty counsel lawyer in the Toronto criminal courts from 1983 to 1985, and then practised criminal law with prominent criminal lawyers William A. Gorewich (now a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice) and Stephen Price.
In 1987 he joined the Research Facility of the Ontario Legal Aid Plan, where he became Head of the Family Law section. In 1989 he joined the Ministry of the Attorney General, Support and Custody Enforcement Branch, as counsel. The Support and Custody Enforcement Program was responsible for the enforcement of child and spousal support orders and custody orders. In 1991 he was appointed Legal Director of the Family Support Plan (which was the new name of the Support and Custody Enforcement Program) and in 1992 he was appointed Director of the entire Program while continuing to serve as Legal Director. The Program is now called the Family Responsibility Office, and is operated by the Ministry of Community and Social Services.
He was appointed a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice in 1995, making him the first openly gay judge in Canada. Brownstone presided in criminal court and family court for 6 years, and since 2001 has presided exclusively in family court, at the North Toronto Family Court.
In August 2010 Brownstone received the prestigious "Colleague in the Spotlight" award from the Canadian Bar Association Judges' Forum.
His commentary on the flaws in the family justice system have prompted reforms by the Attorney-General, who has enacted many of the changes suggested by Brownstone.
Media.
Brownstone's charisma and use of humour has made him one of the most recognizable faces of the Canadian justice system. Brownstone’s public persona and frequent media appearances has led to him being described as "a maverick judge who is a pioneer that is unilaterally changing the public image of the judiciary."
Tug of War.
In addition to his role in the court, Brownstone frequently comments on family law and divorce issues in the Canadian national media. Brownstone has published a best selling book, "Tug of War", on family law and divorce. The book was the first of its kind, written by a sitting judge on legal issues and intended for the general public. The book's proceeds are donated to the Children's Wish Foundation of Canada.
Family Matters.
In 2010, Brownstone hosted an online talk show entitled "Family Matters with Justice Harvey Brownstone" which was the first talk show ever hosted by a sitting Canadian judge Eight episodes were produced for online viewing and made available for free through iTunes and on the show's website. Those episodes dealt with: child support; when do children need lawyers; collaborative law; elder abuse; mediation; how to manage your lawyer; child protection; and prenups. In 2011 Family Matters began broadcasting as a television show. 15 episodes of the show debuted on CHCH TV on September 13, 2011 and were also broadcast on a number of other independent Canadian TV stations in addition to being available free online. Those episodes dealt with the following topics: Parental Alienation; Marriage Confidential; Parenting Coordination; The Smart Divorce; Divorce with Dignity; Fairway Divorce; A View From the Bench; Domestic Violence; Access; Grandparents' Rights; Sexual Addictions; Men's Issues in Family Law; Pets and Divorce; Remarriage; and Online Security and Privacy. Family Matters was renewed for a second season which was filmed in February 2013 in Toronto, Ontario and Victoria, British Columbia. Season 2 made its debut on Canadian television on May 4, 2013 on CHEK TV and CHCH TV featuring 16 episodes addressing the following topics: gambling addictions; infidelity; online dating; bullying; same-sex parenting; the impact of high conflict on children's learning at school; high conflict divorce; child abduction; an introduction to family court; spousal support; anger management; raising teenagers; wills and estates; family financing; and breaking up. Season 2 also features a Question and Answer segment in which Vancouver lawyer Lorne MacLean, QC answers questions submitted by viewers to AdviceScene.com.
Media coverage of Family Matters has commented on the tension between maintaining proper decorum for a sitting judge and creating a television program that is compelling yet educational for the public.
Edie and Thea: A Very Long Engagement.
Brownstone officiated at the marriage of Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer, whose marriage triggered the constitutional litigation at the United States Supreme Court regarding same-sex marriage (United States v. Windsor). Brownstone was featured in the documentary "Edie and Thea: A Very Long Engagement" (Bless Bless Productions, 2010), and is the subject of a full-length interview on the special features on the DVD. He has been recognized for playing an instrumental role in raising Canada's profile in the evolution of same-sex marriage law in the United States.

High-reeve

High-reeve () was a title taken by some English magnates during the 10th and 11th centuries, and is particularly associated with the rulers of Bamburgh. It was not however only used by rulers of Bamburgh; many other places used the title, e.g. there was an Ordulf "High-Reeve of Dumnonia".
The first reference to a "high-reeve" was perhaps in the third code of Edmund I of England, where there is an official known as a "summus praepositus". Alfred Smyth thought "heah-gerefa" was influenced by the Scottish word "mormaer", the meaning of which, supposedly "Great Steward", is possibly similar.
In the "North People's Law", a high-reeve is given a wergild of four thousand thrymsas, the same as a hold and half the wergild of an ealdorman. Ann Williams believes that the High-Reeve was originally an urban official whose job was to deputise for an ealdorman, but unlike other such figures could lead provincial armies.
Hogrefe.
Hogrefe (Low Saxon "hoghe greve", younger forms Hogrebe, Hogrefe, Hogreve, and Hogrewe, also as modern surnames) was a title and function taken by judges presiding a so-called Gogericht, which was part of the local jurisdiction mainly in the formerly Saxon areas in Westphalia and Lower Saxony in Northern Germany. In 1164 a preliminary form of Hogrefe appears first in a document of Medebach. The title remained in use until the 17th century mainly in parts of Electoral Hanover, today's State of Lower Saxony.

<doc id="20446429" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20446429" title="Rally 'round the flag effect">
Rally 'round the flag effect

The rally 'round the flag effect (or syndrome) is a concept used in political science and international relations to explain increased short-run popular support of the President of the United States during periods of international crisis or war. Because Rally 'Round The Flag syndrome reduces criticism of governmental policies, it is seen as a factor of Diversionary Foreign Policy.
Mueller's definition.
Political scientist John Mueller wrote his landmark paper "Presidential Popularity from Truman to Johnson" in 1970, where he conceived the idea of the effect. Mueller defined the effect as coming from an event with three qualities:
In addition, Mueller created five categories of rallies. These categories are considered dated by modern political scientists, as they rely heavily on Cold War events. Mueller's five categories are:
Causes and durations.
Since Mueller's original theories, two schools of thought have emerged to explain the causes of the syndrome. The first, "The Patriotism School of Thought" holds that in times of crisis, the American public sees the President as the embodiment of national unity. The second, "The Opinion Leadership School" believes that the rally emerges from a lack of criticism from members of the opposition party, most often in the United States Congress. If opposition party members appear to support the president, the media has no conflict to report, thus it appears to the public that all is well with the performance of the president. The two theories have both been criticized, but it is generally accepted that the Patriotism School of thought is better to explain causes of rallies, while the Opinion Leadership School of thought is better to explain duration of rallies. It is also believed that the lower the presidential approval rating before the crisis, the larger the increase will be in terms of percentage points because it leaves the president more room for improvement. For example, Franklin Roosevelt only had a 12% increase in approval from 72% to 84% following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, whereas George W. Bush had a 39% increase from 51% to 90% following the attacks on September 11.
Another theory about the cause of the syndrome is believed to be embedded in the US Constitution. Unlike in other countries, the constitution makes the President both head of government and head of state. Because of this, the president receives a temporary boost in popularity because his Head of State role gives him symbolic importance to the American people. However, as time goes on his duties as Head of Government require partisan decisions that polarize opposition parties and diminish popularity. This theory falls in line more with the Opinion Leadership School.
Due to the highly statistical nature of presidential polls, University of Alabama political scientist John O'Neal has approached the study of rally sound the flag using mathematics. O'Neal has postulated that the Opinion Leadership School is the more accurate of the two using mathematical equations. These equations are based on quantified factors such as the number of headlines from the New York Times about the crisis, the presence of bipartisan support or hostility, and prior popularity of the president.
Historical examples.
The effect has been examined within the context of nearly every major foreign policy crises since World War II. Some notable examples:
Controversy.
The idea of the syndrome is seen as controversial because it implies that crises and more importantly, wars actually benefit presidents for political purposes. It is argued that because wars increase the popularity of a president, a president might be more willing to use military force if his approval rating is dropping. Because this diverts attention away from the handling of domestic policies, some believe the rally round the flag syndrome encourages diversionary foreign policy.

Vanessa White

Vanessa Karen White (born 30 October 1989) is an English singer and songwriter. She rose to fame in 2008 as the lead singer of English-Irish girl group The Saturdays, signed to Fascination and Polydor Records. The group have achieved substantial success with numerous top-ten hits as well as a number one single. She is the youngest member of the group.
Early life.
Vanessa White was born in Yeovil, Somerset and is half-Filipina from her mother and half English from her father. She was attracted to performing from a young age and attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School on Saturdays before being offered a full-time place and moving to Stratford, London with her family when she was five. She applied for The Brit School, but was turned down. She appeared in several theatre productions, including the West End production of" The Lion King" as Young Nala and also played one of the King's daughters in The King And I from 2000-2002. She has a brother, Ryan and sister, Celine.
Career.
2007–present: The Saturdays.
Having already been signed as a solo artist, White auditioned for, and was accepted as, a member of a newly formed girl group in 2007. She gelled quickly with the four other members who now refer to her as "our Christina Aguilera" due to her extensive vocal range. Initially, White and band member Una Healy had the strongest relationship, as they discovered that they were very alike. However, she has grown to love the other members all the same. She has also received comparison to American singers Alicia Keys, Beyoncé and Mariah Carey.
During June and July 2009, White toured the UK with The Saturdays (The Work Tour). Before she was about to go on stage for the second show of the tour in Dundee, White tripped over a cable backstage and tore a ligament in her ankle and missed a large proportion of the show that night. Once paramedics had strapped up her foot, she was permitted to join the band on stage in a wheelchair. White spent the next few shows appearing on stage sitting on a bar stool and gradually began to stand for more and more songs as the tour progressed, before being able to perform her choreography again.
White is the only member of The Saturdays to have a solo in every song in their debut album, "Chasing Lights".
Along with the other members of the group, White has co-written a track on their second album, Wordshaker, titled "Deeper". It was written in a two day studio session.
Solo releases and appearances.
White provided additional vocals on Master Shortie's debut album A.D.H.D. on the track 'Swagger Chick'. The album was released on 27 July 2009. In January 2010, White participated in the first series of the ITV celebrity reality television programme Popstar to Operastar. She was the second contestant eliminated, on 22 January. White took part in and was compressed into a box so that it appears only her head, hands and feet are there on Stephen Mulhern's Magic Numbers. In 2013 she featured on Vince Kidd's song The Zoo; the music video debuted on YouTube on 20 April 2013.
Personal life.
White started dating musician Adam Chandler in late 2008 but they split up in May 2010. She has been dating English stylist Gary Salter, since 2011.

Beloslava of Bulgaria

Beloslava () was a Bulgarian princess and Queen consort of Serbia between 1234 and 1243), wife of king Stefan Vladislav I.
History.
Beloslava was the daughter of tsar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and his first wife Anna (religious name Anisia), mentioned in the Synodik of the Bulgarian Church. The couple had another daughter - Maria, who married Manuel of Epirus. It is possible that Beloslava and her sister Maria were illegitimate children of Ivan Asen because his first marriage with Anna was not recognized by the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. But there was no dоubt about the noble birth his daughters so both were married with people of high aristocratic status.
After the battle of Klokotnitsa, Bulgaria become first politic power on the Balkans and Beloslava was married to Serbian prince Stefan Vladislav. The marriage was arranged by his uncle Rastko Nemanjić in order to secure good relations between the Kingdom of Serbia and the Bulgarian Empire. 
In 1234 a Bulgarian-aided coup d'état in Serbia toppled king Stefan Radoslav, a son-in-law and protégé of the "despotes" Theodore of Epirus, and replaced him with Stefan Vladislav, who was his half-brother. So Beloslava become the new queen consort of Serbia.
Bulgarian political influence in Serbia ended after the dead of tsar Ivan Asen II during the invasions of Tatars in Western Europe. In 1243, Stefan Vladislav was overthrown by his younger brother, Stefan Uroš I, and Beloslava fled to Ragusa. The new Serbian king insisted that she should be kept under strict control and, in response, received an oath, in writing, stating that Beloslava would not be allowed to return to Serbia. 
Soon, the conflict between Stefan Vladislav I and Stefan Uroš I was solved. After negotiations Vladislav renounced the crown and Uroš allowed him to rule Zeta as governor while keeping the title of "king". Soon after, Beloslava returned and joined him maintaining also the title of "queen".
Family.
Beloslava and Stefan Vladislav had three children:

Release Me (Agnes song)

"Release Me" is a pop song recorded by Swedish singer Agnes Carlsson taken from her third album "Dance Love Pop". The track was written by Agnes Carlsson, Anders Hansson and Sharon Vaughn. It was released as the album's second single in Sweden, and as Agnes' debut single internationally. The song has been critically appreciated for its swooping harmonies and Agnes' vocal talents. "Release Me" was another top ten hit for Agnes in Sweden and has also been charting in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Worldwide, the single has sold over 900 000 copies making it Agnes' biggest hit to date and a worldwide commercial success.
In July 2009 "Release Me" was released outside of Europe for the first time, in Australia, on Warner Music. The song was also released in the United States on August 18, 2009 where it hit number one on Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs.
Critical reception.
The BBC's "Chartblog" said ""73% of why this is a great song rests with those amazing swooping harmonies. That's not to take anything away from Agnes's vocal talents, it's just her honeyed-rasp, set to a synth-disco backing, is not THAT startlingly new a sound.""
Nick Levine of Digital Spy called "Release Me" ""far classier"" than other europop that is reaching the UK, like September and Velvet. He also said that "" the all-conquering chorus and thumping beats are present and correct, but this has lashings of strings and lavish production flourishes too.""
Chart performance.
"Release Me" was released to radio stations and as a digital download in Sweden on November 24, 2008. and entered the Swedish Singles Chart at number sixty based solely on digital downloads and slowly climbed the chart and peaked at number nine.
The song made its international debut on the Danish Singles Chart on February 27, 2009 at number thirty-nine and has so far peaked at number six and later sold gold with more than 15,000 copies sold. It debuted on the Flanders Ultratop 50 chart on April 11, 2009 at number forty-seven and peaked at number seven, in Wallonia the song debuted in the Ultratop 50 chart at number thirty-three and peaked at number six.
The single was released in the United Kingdom in May 2009 where it became a massive hit for Agnes. It debuted and peaked number 3 on the UK Singles Chart and has so far sold over 350 000 units since its release. It also peaked within the top 10 in Ireland.
During the summer of 2009 "Release me" was able to reach a lot of charts all over Europe; in Norway it entered the chart at thirteen and one week later it peaked at seven. In the Slovakian and Slovenian Singles Chart it peaked at seven and two respectively. After a few weeks on the French download charts and music video charts, "Release Me" finally entered the Official French Singles Chart at seven in late July. It entered a lot of French charts and became the third most played song on French radio during 2009. The song was also ranked high on a number of airplay charts all over Europe. In 2010 the song was translated to Italian and French by the investment banker/art producer Olivier Doria.
On July 27 "Release Me" entered the first chart outside of Europe, the "Australian Dance Chart" at eleven, however on the overall ARIA Charts it peaked at only No. 26. It has also entered the US "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play Chart at 38, and peaked at one. The song is to be released in 35 countries all over the world.
After twelve weeks on the Swedish Singles Chart in early 2009, "Release Me" left the chart. But on September 25, 2009, the song re-entered at 44 after its appearance in "Swedish Idol". Radio stations started to play the 2009 single again, and after Agnes's live performance at the final of "Swedish Idol" it climbed even higher on the charts. In January 2010, "Release Me" entered the top five at Swedish iTunes and reached number 11 on the official chart, giving the song a total of 31 weeks over three years (2008–2010) on the Swedish 60 Top Singles Chart.
Music videos.
The music video for "Release Me" premiered on November 28, 2008, the very same day that the song was released for sale in Sweden.
The video was directed by the swede Anders Rune, who also made the video for Agnes's single On and On that was made for the Swedish, Polish and Dutch market.
The video begins with Agnes laying in front of an orange wall. Then Agnes walks through the streets of Stockholm at night seeing people dancing and preparing for a night out at a club. In the next scene everyone has arrived at the club and they are dancing while Agnes is standing against a wall with a man holding her. Agnes then leaves the club and walks down the street to another club. The next scene shows a bathroom where Agnes is doing her make-up in front of a mirror while two other girls are dancing in the background. These are the main parts of the video, other sequences are shown of people dancing in various places and Agnes singing in front of the orange wall.
The music video had a massive impact in the UK, where it started to spin on radio stations and TV-channels already in February 2009, almost four months before the release of the song. The song was also frequently shown in other parts of Europe, with honors like "song of the week" and "artist of the month" to follow.
US Edition.
The music video made for the European market was rejected by the American record company, Geffen/Interscope, and according to director Thomas Kloss she looked far too grown up. Therefore a new video was shot in Long Beach, Los Angeles in early September. The video was produced by Brett Marx.
The new music video premiered one week after the new "On and On" video exclusive on September 30 on Popeater.com and
one day after on Geffen's website and YouTube channel. The U.S video starts of with Agnes standing in the studio recording "Release Me" and for a few seconds you hear the a cappella version of the song, when suddenly she rushes out the door and, together with her friends, walks to a club. The set-up and structure of the video is similar to the original one, and a major part of the video takes place in the club dancing.
Live performances.
Agnes performed "Release Me" live in the UK on morning TV show GMTV on June 10, 2009. On July 5 Agnes performed "Release Me" at the Dutch musicevent TMF Awards. The day after on July 6 she performed the same song in Sweden in the sing-along show "Lotta på Liseberg", broadcast by TV4. One week later she returned to Gothenburg for the Gothia Cup Opening Ceremony, where she performed the song on Ullevi, the largest venue in northern Europe.
Later in July she headed back to the UK for another two performances, the first one was at the "Party in the Park" on July 25 in Leeds, where she performed among other stars such as Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott. The next day she performed both "Release Me" and "On and On" at Nightingales in Birmingham. On 8 August Agnes performed the song in the Polish music competition "Sopot Hit Festival".
Agnes performed in the U.S for the first time in the morning show "Good Day New York". 
On December 11, 2009, Agnes visited the Swedish "Idol 2009"-final to perform her single "Release Me", which was released in Sweden almost a year earlier.
During the spring of 2010 Agnes went to the U.S to start promote the single, which led to numerous performances on TV-shows and concerts all over America. Among others she performed at "White Party" in Palm Springs on Sunday April 11, where Britney Spears wrote on her Twitter that she was on her way to check out Agnes.
Agnes performed "Release Me" at the 3rd annual NewNowNext Awards aired on June 17, 2010 in Los Angeles on Logo. O, 16 May 2013, Agnes performed the song during the interval of the second semi-final of Eurovision Song Contest 2013.

High Marnham Power Station

High Marnham Power Station was a former coal-fired power station, currently undergoing demolition. It is located in Nottinghamshire, to the west of the River Trent, approximately 0.5 mile north of the village of Marnham, Nottinghamshire, birthplace of Edmund Cartwright b1743. Inventor of the first Power Loom 1785/1787 and opened a Weaving Factory in nearby Doncaster. High Marnham was the most southerly of three power stations which lined the River Trent, known locally as Megawatt Valley, the others being West Burton and Cottam. The station was constructed by the CEGB Northern Project Group overseen by resident engineer, Douglas Derbyshire and the main contractor Alfred McAlpine. The power station was constructed on a "green field site", started in Nov 1955 and fully commissioned by 1962. With a total generating capacity of 1000MW [946 MW net, it was the first 1000MW power station built and commissioned in Europe, to operate at higher boiler operational temperature/pressure limits than ever previously commissioned.
Boiler plant.
Designed and built by International Combustion Ltd. Four boiler units, each weighing about 14,000 tons were suspended on beams and support columns for a vertical expansion of 8inches. Each boiler built in twin furnace construction with 1.5inch bore tubes, all connected to a common drum at the top of the boiler, fitted with safety valves set at 2500 psi. One furnace carried the superheat pendants,connected to boiler drum top and to an outlet header, fitted with a safety valve set at 2450 psi. The second furnace carried the reheat pendants connected to an inlet header from the HP cylinder exhaust and to an outlet header to turbine IP cylinder. The lower section of the furnace corners contained a wind box with the pulverized fuel nozzles and retractable oil burners. Fuel nozzles and burners were aligned at an imaginary circle in the furnace ensuring an even heat distribution. Pulverized fuel nozzle were provided with vertical movement to control temperature conditions. At the bottom of each furnace,the front and rear wall tubes were formed into an inward slope where the tubes were bent backa nose and gapto their original vertical wall alignment terminating at their front and rear bottom furnace water tube headers. A steel skirt was fitted around each furnace base,ash hoppers
Water circulation within the boiler furnace was assisted by Hayward Tyler Co fully immersed electrical pumps. 
The pulverized fuel plant was built and installed by International Combustion Ltd. Four Lopulco coal roller mills with pulverized coal fans per boiler,located in the boiler house basement. Coal fed from overhead bunkers by speed regulated drum feeders to the mills and crushed to fine dust by three 7.5 ton roller doors per mill,blown into the wind boxes through pipework and the PF nozzles. Combustion air was delivered by two forced draught fans,located above the coal bunkers taking warm air from above the boiler roof casing,and discharging it though rotating heat exchangers to the furnace wind boxes. The spent hot gasses were drawn from the furnaces through the pendants,water tube economizers, rotating heat exchanger, cyclone dust collectors and electrostatic precipitators, by two induced draught fans before discharging gasses into the chimney flu ducts and up the 500foot high chimneys.
The heavy combustion productsinto basement mounted hoppers[with water troughsunder each furnace,that engaged with the bottom furnace header casing skirt. The hoppers were emptied by a water jet/sluice arrangement into an ash receiving pit.
Boiler Water Feed System.
Condensed steam was taken from turbine condenser and pumped back into the boiler feed system,via the unit evaporator,low and high pressure water tube heatersbeen subjected to bled steam heat from turbine cylindersinto a de-aerator, The de-aerated water was taken by the main feed pumpstage cartridge design pump or a smaller start up pumpand discharged at 3000psi,into the boiler water feed system through feed regulating valves. Both feed pump types were electric motor driven. Additional station boiler feed water supply could also be made up by the station water treatment plant and fed into the de-aerator,This was operated and controlled by the station chemistry dept.
Turbine/Generator Plant.
Designed and built by the English Electric Co. Four steam turbine units of high pressure,intermediate pressure and double-flow Low Pressure Turbine cylinders were coupled to a 250MW generator. The shafts rotated at 3000rpm,producing electricity for the unit transformer at 275Kv. The steam flow into the turbine was regulated by the hydraulically controlled steam inlet valves to maintain a generating speed of 3000rpm. The turbine maximum over-speed protection was by weight eccentric rings on the turbine shaft,set to throw-out at a predetermined RPM and shutting the HP cylinder inlet steam valves. Steam flow through the hp turbine cylinders was exhausted back to the boiler for reheatingsome having been bled off to feed heaters,returned to the IP cylinder(with some bled off to LP feed heaters)and exhausted in the double-flow LP cylinder under vacuum into underslung water-cooled condensers. Condenser cooling water was delivered from a sub-basement ring main around the turbine house. The turbine/generator assembly was mounted on reinforced concrete pedestals that ran along the length of the turbine Hall.
CW Plant.
Cooling water pumps were located between cooling towers in a purpose made building to deliver cooling water into a ring main for the turbine condensers,the warm water was passed on through to the 350 ft cooling towers,falling into the tower moats to be channeled back through screens and a chlorination process to the pump suctions for recirculation. Water loss through evaporation, was made up from the river Tent by suction screened pumps.
Coal Plant.
Located to the north of the main plant with a 10 mile spur from mainline cross country rail system. Consisted of control room,coal wagon marshaling yard and conveyor systems. Later modifications were "merry-go-round" system of automatic coal wagon unloading installed c1965 to evaluate for future "Stations Systems". Bunker coal supply ran from coal plant on inclined conveyor to the boiler house,which fed onto a moving "feed head" conveyor above the individual boiler coal bunkers.
Closure and demolition.
The station closed in 2003 after nearly 45 years in operation, with a loss of 119 jobs. The station's chimneys were demolished on 15 December 2004. The station's -high boiler house was demolished on 5 October 2006. The station's five cooling towers were demolished on 15 July 2012 at 10:00.
In late 2009, the railway connection that used to supply coal to the power station became Network Rail's High Marnham Test Trackfor innovation and development because the line is an all welded joints,laid on concrete sleepers and 10 miles long.

Greenlandic European Economic Community membership referendum, 1982

The Greenlandic European Economic Community membership referendum, 1982 was a consultative referendum over whether Greenland should continue to be a member of the European Economic Community which took place on 23 February 1982.
Greenland joined the European Communities in 1973 when Denmark joined, even though a majority of 70% of the Greenlandic votes had been against membership in the Danish EC referendum held in 1972. In the spring of 1981, after the Greenlandic home-rule had been established in 1979 and the eurosceptic Siumut won the 1979 election, the Parliament of Greenland agreed to hold a consultative referendum on their continued membership. The result of the referendum was a majority in favour of leaving the EC, and this was enacted by the Greenland Treaty. The Treaty allowed the EC to keep its fishing rights. Greenland continues to be considered a Overseas Countries and Territory of the EU, giving it a special relationship with Union.

Wiesbaden-Sonnenberg

Sonnenberg is a borough of Wiesbaden, the capital of the state of Hesse, Germany. Formerly an independent municipality, Sonnenberg was incorporated into Wiesbaden on October 28, 1926. The borough has approximately 8,000 residents.
Sonnenberg is located in the northeast of the city. Its historic center is located in the foothills of the Taunus in the narrow valley of Rambach.
"Burg Sonnenberg" (Sonnenberg Castle) is situated on a mountain spur above the town. While the castle is now in ruins, the castle tower and parts of the fortifications and the city walls are preserved to a large extent.
History of Sonnenberg Castle.
The first written mention of Sonnenberg dates from 1208 or 1209 in the name of the first "Burgmann" ("castellan") Ulbert of Idstein-Sonnenberg as "Sonnenburch" and "Sunnenberc". It was first called "Sonnenberc" in 1221. Ownership of the land was initially disputed by the Saint Martin's Domstift (cathedral endowment) of Mainz. This dependence to Mainz had been generally unfavorable to Sonnenberg a long time, because four Archbishops of Mainz in the 13th century alone were from Eppstein, the enemies of Nassau. The dispute over Sonnenberg was settled by a treaty in 1221, in which Nassau obtained the land on which the castle is built as a fief for 30 Marks. Sonnenberg Castle was one of nine castles ruled by the House of Nassau.
In 1240, Henry II became the sole ruler of the Nassau possessions. After his death, the inheritance was divided among Henry's sons, Walram and Otto. Sonnenberg became the possession of Walram's Countship of Nassau-Weilburg.
In 1283, Walram's son Count Adolf of Nassau rebuilt the castle (it had been heavily damaged in conflict with Eppstein). The castle was Adolf's seat when he was crowned King of the Romans on May 5, 1292. After Adolf's death in 1298, Eppstein, with the help of Archbishop of Mainz, Gerhard II, again occupied and destroyed the castle. Adolf's son, Gerlach I, still a child, was saved.
Later, under Gerlach's rule, peace was reached between Nassau and Eppstein and the Castle of Sonnenberg was expanded. In 1338, Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian visited the castle, a testimony to its size and security in those years. On July 29, 1351, the King of Bohemia, and later Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV awarded the town of Sonnenberg rights to its own jurisdiction. As a result, houses at the foot of the castle could now be surrounded by a wall in an overall integrated complex, providing the residents some security.
When Count Gerlach died in 1361, his son Ruprecht (from his second marriage), since 1355 Count of the newly established dominion of Nassau-Sonnenberg, inherited the castle. When Ruprecht died childless in 1390, his wife Anna continued to live there. After her death in 1405, the castle returned to the joint rule of the Counts of Nassau-Idstein and Nassau-Weilburg and deteriorated over the next 200 years. However, under Count Philipp von Nassau-Idstein (1558 to 1566), the castle again became a residence. He, too, died childless and the end of the 16th century the castle was uninhabited.
Sonnenberg experienced major damage in 1625 during the Thirty Years' War, so that only a dozen houses were habitable. The castle served as a quarry for the reconstruction of the houses in the valley. In 1672, the city was again devastated by troops of the Margraviate of Brandenburg.
Thalkirche.
Due to damage incurred during the Thirty Years War in 1625, the church was unusable. Services were held in the Holy Cross Chapel in the Sonnenberg Cemetery for decades afterward. The church was looted by the soldiers of Brandenburg in 1672.
A gallery was added in 1733. In 1883, there was a thorough renovation of the church. The pulpit was moved to a position in the center above the altar, where it stands today.

Pure (programming language)

Pure is a dynamically typed, functional programming language based on term rewriting. It has facilities for user-defined operator syntax, macros, multiple-precision numbers, and compilation to native code through the LLVM. It is the successor to the Q programming language.
Pure comes with an interpreter and debugger, provides automatic memory management, and has powerful functional and symbolic programming capabilities as well as interface to C libraries (e.g. for numerics, low-level protocols, and other such tasks). At the same time, Pure is a "small" language designed from scratch; its interpreter is not large, and the library modules are written in Pure itself. The syntax of Pure resembles that of Miranda and Haskell, but it is a free-format language and thus uses explicit delimiters (rather than indentation) to indicate program structure.
The Pure language is a successor of the Q language created previously by the same author, Albert Gräf at the University of Mainz in Germany. Compared to Q, it offers some important new features (in particular, local functions with lexical scoping, efficient vector and matrix support and the built-in C interface) and programs run much faster as they are JIT-compiled to native code on the fly. Pure is mostly aimed at mathematical applications and scientific computing currently, but its interactive interpreter environment, the C interface and the growing collection of addon modules make it suitable for a variety of other applications, such as artificial intelligence, symbolic computation, and real-time multimedia processing.
Pure plugins are available for the Gnumeric spreadsheet and Miller Puckette's Pure Data graphical multimedia software, which make it possible to extend these programs with functions written in the Pure language. Interfaces to GNU Octave, OpenCV, OpenGL, the GNU Scientific Library, FAUST, SuperCollider and liblo (for OSC) are also provided as library modules.
Pure is free software distributed (mostly) under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (or later).
Examples.
The Fibonacci numbers (naive version):
Better (tail-recursive and linear-time) version:
Compute the first 20 Fibonacci numbers:
An algorithm for the n queens problem which employs a list comprehension to organize the backtracking search:
While Pure uses eager evaluation by default, it also supports lazy data structures such as streams (lazy lists). For instance, here is a (suboptimal) trial division version of the sieve of Eratosthenes (attributed to David Turner) which computes the stream of all prime numbers:
Note the use of the & operator which turns the tail of the sieve into a thunk to delay its computation. The thunk is evaluated implicitly and then memoized (using call by need evaluation) when the corresponding part of the list is accessed, e.g.:
Pure has efficient support for vectors and matrices (similar to that provided by MATLAB and GNU Octave), including vector and matrix comprehensions. E.g., a Gaussian elimination algorithm with partial pivoting can be implemented as follows in Pure:
As a language based on term rewriting, Pure fully supports symbolic computation with expressions. Here is an example showing the use of local rewriting rules to expand and factor simple arithmetic expressions:
Calling C functions from Pure is very easy. E.g., the following imports the puts function from the C library and uses it to print the string "Hello, world!" on the terminal:

Leonard Grant (born July 25, 1980), better known by his stage name, Uncle Murda, is an American rapper from the Pink Houses Projects of East New York.
Biography.
Musical career.
In 2007 his manager and DJ Green Lantern introduced Uncle Murda's music to Jay-Z. The Brooklyn born rapper/CEO signed Uncle Murda to Roc-A-Fella Records soon after. They started to promote him immediately by placing him on a track with popular label-mates Fabolous and Jay-Z for the song "Brooklyn" (Featured on From Nothin' to Somethin' album) and everything seemed to be going well for the rapper. However in late 2008 rumors that Uncle Murda left Def Jam came about. In an interview with DJ Vlad, Uncle Murda confirmed the rumors that he has split from Def Jam and Roc-A-Fella Records claiming everything went downhill since Jay-Z's departure.
On January 22, 2008, Uncle Murda was shot in the head while in a parked car on Linden Blvd in East New York but was not seriously hurt.
In February 2011, it was revealed that he would take part in a new Hiphop/Pro Wrestling collaboration, the Urban Wrestling Federation with taping of the first bout "First Blood" taking place in June 2011.
As of late 2012 Uncle Murda changed his name to "U.M" he was also added to the Roster on Epic Records by L.A Reid.
Controversy.
Papoose.
After releasing diss songs back and forth the two rappers with their managers decided to end the conflict. On May 9, 2008, Papoose's DJ, DJ Kay Slay, announced that the two rappers had ended the feud on his radio show. Soon after, the two rappers appeared on the same song together for the remix of "Don't Take It There" also featuring Junior Reid, Tony Yayo, Jim Jones, and Sheek Louch and have collaborated since then.

Central Park (Winnipeg)

Central Park is a large urban park located in Downtown Winnipeg, and forms the heart of the neighbourhood of the same name. The area is bound by Notre Dame Ave. to the north, Ellice Ave. to the south, Donald St. to the east and Balmoral St. to the west. Everything within the neighbourhood's one-kilometre loop can be reached within eight minutes on foot.
70 per cent of all refugees coming to Winnipeg live downtown, in and around the Central Park area.
It's one of Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhoods with around 13,755 people per square km according to Statistics Canada's 2001 Census.
Culture and Entertainment.
Central Park is home to many different ethnicities including Vietnamese, Arabs, Chinese, First Nations, Filipinos, with a majority from Africa.
Because of the growing African population, the area has been transforming in recent years, giving it a new sense of community and culture. Its Central Market for Global Families is a summer outdoor market that sells handmade and imported African clothing, beadwork, handicrafts, weavings, art, as well as organic produce some African/tropical greens raised by local residents on a community garden at University of Manitoba
Live entertainment fills the air in Central Park on warm Friday nights throughout the summer and are a significant aspect to the markets on Saturday. Special events attract hundreds of people to the park on World Refugee Day in June, HIV/AIDS Awareness Day in July by a newcomer-aboriginal coalition and Central Park Revival.
Demographics and Crime.
In 2006, the population of Central Park was 3,555 people. Central Park does not have a majority racial group as it is 24.8% White, 21.5% Aboriginal and 53.7% is made up of visible minorities; 20.0% Black, 16.6% Southeast Asian, 6.2% Arab/West Asian, 5.4% East Asian and the rest made up of other groups in lower populations. Central Park is 0.2 km squared, which has a population density of 15,277.3 people per square km.
Central Park is a lower income neighbourhood, with a median household income of $18,473, which is almost 3 times less than the cities at $49,790. There are 1,950 dwellings, only 10.8% which are owned and the average dwelling is worth $58,388. 6.7% of these dwellings are in need of major repairs.
Central Park has a lot of crime. In 2012, there was one homicide making the rate per 100,000 residents 28.1. For other crimes, the rates per 100,000 follow as; 2025.3 for robbery, 84.4 for sexual assaults, 534.5 for break and enters and 281.3 for auto thefts.
Architecture.
The Waddell Fountain commemorates Emily Margaret Waddell, who died in 1908. It is a rare example of the High Victorian style in Manitoba, and is based on the 1844 Gothic Revival monument in Edinburgh for Romantic poet Sir Walter Scott.
In her will, Emily Waddell stipulated that if her husband Thomas remarried, he must donate $10,000 to the city to construct a fountain. Thomas Waddell, who did remarry, raised the money in 1914.
Local architect John Manuel, who also designed structures at the University of Manitoba, was tasked with designing the Waddell Fountain. He would later move to Alberta in 1927 to oversee construction of Canadian Pacific Railway hotels in Banff and Lake Louise.
Buildings around Central Park feature a diverse range of architectural styles and densities, coexisting with various shops and services. The YM-YMCA building, Knox United Church, Calvary Temple, and a number of area schools provide a strong institutional component for families and senior citizens. Other landmark buildings are The International Centre, Welcome Place, and Edohei, considered to be Manitoba's first sushi restaurant.

James &quot;Sugar Boy&quot; Crawford

James "Sugar Boy" Crawford, Jr. (October 12, 1934 – September 15, 2012) was a New Orleans R&B musician. He was the author of "Jock-A-Mo" (1954), a hit that was later recreated as "Iko Iko", by The Dixie Cups and recorded by many artists including Dr. John, Belle Stars, The Grateful Dead, Cyndi Lauper, and as "Geto Boys" by Glass Candy. 
Life and career.
Starting out on trombone, Crawford formed a band which local DJ Doctor Daddy-O named "The Chapaka Shawee" (Creole for "We Aren't Raccoons"), the title of an instrumental that they played. Signed on by Chess Records president Leonard Chess, the group was renamed 'Sugar Boy and his Cane Cutters'.
Although his song "Jock-A-Mo" became a standard at the New Orleans Mardi Gras, Crawford himself disappeared from public view, and in a 2002 interview for "Offbeat", told how his career came to an abrupt halt in 1963, after a severe beating at the hands of state troopers incapacitated him for two years, forcing him to leave the music industry. In 1969, he decided to limit his singing to in church only. In 2012 Crawford made a guest appearance singing gospel on an episode of the HBO series "Treme". He died one month before the episode aired.
Crawford appeared on his grandson Davell Crawford's 1995 album, "Let Them Talk". He made some stage appearances with Davell including one at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (1996), and more recently at the seventh annual Ponderosa Stomp in April 2008.
Among the artists Crawford recorded with was Snooks Eaglin. He died after a brief illness in a hospice in 2012, aged 77.

Barrel nut

A barrel nut (also known as steel cross dowel or dowel nut) is a specialized nut, and is commonly used in aerospace and ready to assembly furniture, and knockdown furniture applications. It is used to bolt thin sheet metal parts to larger, often billet or forged, parts. The barrel nut is a round slug, or formed sheet metal part with threads perpendicular to the length of the nut. The nut sits in a hole inside the forging and a standard machine screw is threaded into the barrel nut from outside the sheet metal. They are preferred over a standard nut and bolt, because they do not require a flange to be machined or forged onto the receiving part, thus reducing weight.
Barrel nuts are also common in flat-pack furniture, where long bolts and barrel nuts are used to hold together T joints in chipboard sheets.

<doc id="20447034" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20447034" title="Gallery Stratford">
Gallery Stratford

Gallery Stratford is a public art gallery located in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1967, the Gallery has established itself as one of the region’s leading art galleries, organizing exhibitions of local, national and international visual artists. The gallery showcases contemporary work reflecting current changes in art making and pieces from its collection.
Mission statement.
Gallery Stratford’s mission is to engage the community of Stratford and its visitors in the advancement and appreciation of the visual arts in order to inspire and enrich lives.
History.
Built in 1883 on the banks of the Avon River, Stratford’s original pump house with its elaborate architectural elements and picturesque setting is a perfect location today for the city’s public gallery of visual art - Gallery Stratford. Located at 54 Romeo Street, the building’s Queen Anne Style architecture contains Gothic Revival Style elements that are seen elsewhere in the community. The character of the former Water Works building is quite in keeping with the designs of George F. Durand, a prominent London, Ontario architect who designed the Perth County Courthouse.
Durand, one of Ontario’s leading architects of the time, felt, very strongly, that architecture was an art, not an engineering project; his structures reflecting the combination of more than one style of design associated with the Queen Anne Style. Features such as pairings of lancet, or narrow pointed windows and the polychromatic effects in the brickwork are characteristic of Durand. Remnants of the once monumental entrance-way, with its wedge-shaped gable and the arch within an arch motif, reflect Durand’s way of thinking.
While the Gallery’s exterior appears cottage-like, the building was never designed for domestic living. In its original state, the pump room had 16 foot high walls decorated, in places, by a “wandering artist.” It had a brick floor and an oiled hardwood ceiling. Two other men responsible for the construction of the Waterworks in Stratford were W. Perry, Jr., who was responsible for putting the pumping machines in place and William Roberts, who was the building contractor. Roberts was not only a builder, but was also a brick manufacturer and the pump house was built using his “celebrated superior white patent pressed brick.”
By 1964, the historic building became obsolete when the Stratford Public Utilities Commission opened a new pump house across the street; there was a possibility that the buildings would be demolished. The Stratford Art Society (founded in 1945) prepared a feasibility plan to convert the buildings into a prestigious art gallery. In 1966, the Stratford Art Society became known as the Stratford Art Association, and its director was Robert Ihrig. With receipt of financial backing in 1967 from Rothman’s Pall Mall of Canada Limited, The Stratford Art Association renovated and opened the doors of the Rothman Art Gallery.
The Rothman Art Gallery was an active cultural centre for the region, exhibiting emerging Canadian and International artists. In partnership with the Stratford Festival a ‘Music at Midnight’ series flourished at the Rothman Art Gallery from 1969 until 1976; presenting unscheduled appearances by the Festivals guest musicians and chamber concerts by members of the resident Festival orchestra. By 1974, Rothman’s underwent internal organizational changes that altered the way the company supported the arts. Rothmans eventually removed themselves from this project, but not before spending in the neighborhood of a million dollars to develop a viable art gallery.
Withdrawal of Rothman’s along with its financial support over the next three years resulted in the gallery’s new name – Gallery Stratford. In 1985, Gallery Stratford’s unique architectural exterior was recognized with the City of Stratford designating it a Heritage Building.
Permanent Collection.
The Permanent Collection of Gallery Stratford includes over 1000 works of art. The majority of the collection consists of works on paper by Canadian artists: prints, drawings, and paintings. Many of the works were purchased in the early years of the Rothman’s Art Gallery by the women’s volunteer committees. In more recent years, works have been donated by artists who have had exhibitions at Gallery Stratford.
The gallery is dedicated to exhibiting the works on an ongoing basis throughout the year. The third or lower gallery is reserved for this purpose. Exhibitions from the permanent collection are curated to relate to the exhibitions on in the upper galleries. Whether by medium or by theme, it becomes an interesting project to look into the collection for works that comment or expand on themes in the other exhibitions.
As with many other public galleries in Ontario and Canada, the storage space is inadequate. The board and staff are looking into various solutions to this challenge.
Education.
Gallery Stratford involves the community in its programming to facilitate visual arts awareness for adults and children. Programs change seasonally, with studio classes ranging from oil painting, drawing and illustration to photography and printmaking. 
For students, class visits to Gallery Stratford are interactive and curriculum-based; encouraging students to find pleasure and meaning in art, and to think critically about art work. Students are guided during their visits by staff or docents who lead discussions on the content and artistic qualities of selected original works of art. Programs change regularly to compliment current exhibitions.
The gallery also features an open community studio, stocked with creative materials. The community studio guided activities reinforce key concepts introduced in the exhibitions, helping participants to connect with the art work.
During the second Sunday of each month from September to May, Gallery Stratford offers Family Art Sundays. This free program runs from 1-3pm and is led by a Gallery educator. 
Through a partnership with the Toronto International Film Festival Group, Gallery Stratford offers a special selection of films on the third Monday of every month from September to May at the Stratford Cinemas.

558th Flying Training Squadron

The 558th Flying Training Squadron (558 FTS) is a United States Air Force unit assigned to the 12th Flying Training Wing based at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. The squadron trains individuals on how to properly operate the MQ-1 Predator.
Overview.
In a response to the dangers of insurgent warfare, Randolph AFB has assigned a new squadron that will eventually train more than 500 airmen annually to fly and operate remote-controlled aircraft.
The May 20, 2010 reactivation of “The Phantom Knights” — Randolph's 558th Flying Training Squadron — will make Randolph officially the Air Force's only site to offer undergraduate, or beginning, training in remotely piloted aircraft. Training in a test program has been taking place for about 1½ years there.
It marks the base's commitment to providing “the most sought-after capability in theater,” Lt. Col. Bryan Runkle, who will assume command of the squadron, said in a release. “I'm honored to be part of the Air Force's first squadron dedicated to RPA training.”
Randolph officials are calling the move historic, since the squadron will train students on RPAs as their first aircraft and sensor operators entering their first career field. An RPA flight crew typically has one sensor operator responsible for controlling video, radar and weapons equipment.
The 12th Flying Training Wing, Randolph's host unit since 1972, conducts training for instructor pilots, combat systems officers and student fighter pilots. The 558th, with roots dating to 1942, was last activated to fly T-6As at Randolph in 2002, and then inactivated when another squadron took over that mission in 2006.
The new squadron will be the home of undergraduate training for the MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk. Randolph began an RPA fundamentals course in the fall 2008, and last year ran a “Beta test class” through an instrument qualification course on RPAs, base officials said. Last August, the base began a basic sensor operators' course.
While many still join the Air Force in hopes of flying manned bombers, fighters and tankers, many are going into operation of RPAs because it's a career growth area and is important in today's battlefield, Air Force officials said.
The squadron now has about 60 students but expects 120 in 2011 and 150 in 2013, said Beverly Simas, spokeswoman with the training wing. The beginner courses run four weeks, with the instrument qualification course lasting 10 weeks.
Residents of areas near the base won't see the aircraft flying, since most of the training at Randolph will be taught in classrooms or on simulators. Formal training on RPAs will occur at Creech AFB, Nev.; Holloman AFB, N.M.; Beale AFB, Calif.; and March AFB, Calif.
Simas said the Air Force prefers the acronym RPA to UAV — unmanned aerial vehicle.
History.
Activated as a B-26 Marauder medium bombardment squadron in late 1942. Trained under Third Air Force and deployed to European Theater of Operations (ETO) in July 1943. Initially being stationed in England and assigned to IX Bomber Command,
Engaged in tactical bombardment of enemy targets in Occupied Europe initially from stations in England, then after D-Day, moved to Advanced Landing Grounds in France and Belgium; advancing eastward as Allied ground forces advanced. Supported Eighth Air Force strategic bombardment missions over Nazi Germany and Occupied Europe; striking enemy airfields to obtain maximum interference in Luftwaffe day interceptor attacks on heavy bomber formations returning to England. Also participated in Western Allied Invasion of Germany, March-April 1945, combat ending with German Capitation in May 1945.
Became part of the United States Air Forces in Europe while squadron demobilized personnel in 1945. Squadron reassigned to the United States as a paper unit, inactivated in November 1945.
Activated in 1962 as one of the initial F-4C Phantom II fighter squadrons when the aircraft was made operational by the Air Force. When activated, F-4Cs were not yet in production. In order to get the squadron operational, second-line F-84F Thunderjets were transferred from the Air National Guard. Received Navy F4Hs (later F-4B) for training; receiving F-4Cs in January 1964. Deployed to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War and flew combat missions, primary over North Vietnam until Cam Ranh Air Base was closed in November 1970.
Reactivated as a training squadron in 1992, it specialized in undergraduate navigator training from, 15 December 1992-1 October 1996 and 16 January 2002-28 September 2006.
Reactivated in 2010 for MQ-1 Predator operator flight training.

Thomas Parkinson

Thomas F. Parkinson (1920–1992) Professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley, was a poet in his own right; an expert on the poetry of W. B. Yeats; and one of the first academic authorities to write about the Beat poets and novelists of San Francisco in the 1950s and 1960s. A deeply thoughtful man of great integrity, he was a quiet political activist for much of his life, and survived a murder attempt in 1961 by a deranged former student who sought to "get someone who was associated with Communism." Though Parkinson survived being shot in the face (and bore the scars of the assault for the rest of his life), the teaching assistant who was with him at the time was killed. Thomas Parkinson died of an apparent heart attack in 1992 after a long illness.
Early life and influences.
Parkinson's early life was affected by the Great Depression and the Second World War. Growing up in San Francisco as the son of a master-plumber union leader who was blacklisted during the General Strike of the late 1930s, Parkinson developed a respect for labor and a sensitivity to social injustice. He attended Lowell High School and some junior college, where he was inspired by gifted teachers. When WWII began, Parkinson enlisted in the Army, but was eventually discharged because he was too tall. In the years that followed, Parkinson worked a motley series of jobs, as an insurance agent, a ship's outfitter, and a lumberjack. And he continued to read widely and deeply. He eventually returned to UC Berkeley, where he completed his Bachelor's degree in three years.
Academic career and activism.
While he was developing an academic career at Berkeley in the 1950s, Parkinson became immersed in the continuing political battles of his times. A tireless supporter of students both inside and outside the classroom, Parkinson made a number of public statements about paltry funding for student scholarships, including those for women students. An article he published in the campus newspaper, the "Daily Californian", sparked the murder attempt by a former student who claimed to have been commanded by God. Parkinson was severely injured in the attack—several of his vertebrae were fused and his face permanently damaged, and the teaching assistant who was with him at the time was killed. Parkinson continued to promote liberal causes, however, and served as campus Ombudsman, chaired the Berkeley chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), and testified at the obscenity trial on behalf of Allen Ginsberg's "Howl". He was instrumental in helping promote humanities study, teacher training, and extension courses for non-matriculated students during a period when the university was pressured to specialize its programs and become increasingly elite.
Publications.
During this period, Parkinson's academic career began to flourish as he published two critical works: "W. B. Yeats, Self-Critic" (1961) and "W. B. Yeats, The Later Poetry" (1964), which established him as an authority on the Anglo-Irish poet. He was also one of the first academic critics to appreciate and promote the works of Beat writers like Allen Ginsberg, but also of John Montague (poet), and Robert Duncan. He published his "Casebook on the Beats" in 1961. He became part of the circle of writers, including Lawrence Ferlinghetti, that helped evolve the San Francisco literary culture of the 1960s, and served as a unique voice as both critic and fellow-poet. Later volumes on Hart Crane and other poets won him lasting acclaim. His last book,"Poets, Poems, Movements" (1987), is an award-winning collection of essays.
When Parkinson was an undergraduate at Cal he won the Emily Chamberlain Cook Prize in Poetry -- the twenty-sixth Award -- in 1945, for his poem "Letter to a Young Lady" which was published as a staple back that year by The Circle.

Marriage privatization

Marriage privatization is the concept that the state should have no authority to define the terms of personal relationships such as marriage. Proponents of marriage privatization, including certain minarchists, anarchists, libertarians, and opponents of government interventionism, claim that such relationships are best defined by private individuals and not the state. Arguments for the privatization of marriage have been offered by a number of scholars and writers. Proponents of marriage privatization often argue that privatizing marriage is a solution to the social controversy over same-sex marriage. Arguments for and against the privatization of marriage span both liberal and conservative political camps.
Advocacy.
Libertarian advocacy.
In 1997, libertarian David Boaz wrote an article for "Slate" titled “Privatize Marriage: A Simple Solution to the Gay-Marriage Debate." In the article, Boaz suggests privatizing marriage in a way that models the nature of standard business contracts. Boaz's idea is to allow two (possibly more) individuals to set the terms of their own private marital contract in a way that is best for the individuals involved. "When children or large sums of money are involved, an enforceable contract spelling out the parties' respective rights and obligations is probably advisable. But the existence and details of such an agreement should be up to the parties." According to Boaz the government could be called upon to enforce the contract but may have no other role in developing the contract and setting the terms.
In 2002, anarchist Wendy McElroy echoed Boaz's business contract model in an essay for "Ifeminists" titled "It's Time to Privatize Marriage."
Marriage should be privatized. Let people make their own marriage contracts according to their conscience, religion and common sense. Those contracts could be registered with the state, recognized as legal and arbitrated by the courts, but the terms would be determined by those involved.
McElroy has also said:
Why is marriage declining? One reason is that it has become a three-way contract between two people and the government.
In 2003, political columnist Ryan McMaken, writing on LewRockwell.com, raised the issue of marriage privatization arguing that the rise of state-sanctioned marriage coincides historically with the expansion of government. In his article titled "Married to the State," McMaken wrote:
The question we are then left with today is one of whether the churches and individuals should be looking to privatize marriage yet again and to begin making a distinction between secular contracts between private citizens and religious unions that should be kept beyond the power of the State. Such a move, of course, would bring with it new assumptions about the role of the State in divorce, children, and a variety of other aspects of family life. The State will not give up control over these things easily, for the assertion that the importance of marriage makes it a legitimate interest of the State is only true from the point of view of the State itself, for as the foundation of society, marriage and family cannot be entrusted to governments just to be blown about by the winds of democratic opinion, for the same government that has the power to protect can just as easily destroy.
In a similar libertarian vein, the radio talk-show host Larry Elder endorsed the privatization of marriage. In "The State Should Get Out of the Marriage Business", a 2004 article published in on the website Capitalism Magazine, Elder wrote:
How about government simply getting out of the marriage-license-granting business? (Ditto for government licenses necessary to cut hair, drive a taxi, open a business or enter a profession.) Leave marriage to non-governmental institutions, like churches, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship or private institutions. Adultery, although legal, remains a sin subject to societal condemnation. It's tough to legislate away condemnation or legislate in approval. Those who view same-sex marriage as sinful will continue to do so, no matter what the government, the courts or their neighbors say.
In 2006, law professor Colin P.A. Jones wrote an article appearing in the "San Francisco Chronicle" titled "Marriage Proposal: Why Not Privatize?" following the business model for privatization Jones writes:
Subject to certain statutory constraints, businesspeople have long been free to form whatever sort of partnership they felt appropriate to their needs. Why not make the same possible for marriage, which is a partnership based on one of the oldest types of contractual relationships? 
In 2009, author and journalist Naomi Wolf wrote about getting the state out of marriage in "The Times":
Let's also get the state out of the marriage union. In spite of the dress and the flowers, marriage is a business contract. Women, generally, don't understand this, until it hits them over the head upon divorce. Let's take a lead from our gay and lesbian friends, who, without state marriage, often create domestic partnerships with financial autonomy and unity spelt out. A heterosexual parallel: celebrate marriage with a religious or emotional ceremony — leave the state out of it — and create a business- or domestic-partner contract aligning the couple legally.
Professor Gary Becker, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, has said that:
With marriage contracts that set out the couple's commitments, there is little reason why judges should retain their current involvement in marriage.
As of 2013, the only member of US Congress to support privatization of state marriage is Republican Justin Amash.
Religious advocacy.
Pepperdine University law professor Douglas Kmiec, an influential Roman Catholic commentator, told the "Catholic News Agency" that churches that do not accept same-sex marriage have a genuine concern that they be subject to penalties such as losing public benefits or receiving lawsuits. He argued that the state should just allot people "civil licenses," with the terminology "marriage" left "as a religious concept" for groups to debate outside the scope of government.
Liberal advocacy.
Though often introduced from conservative commentators, marriage privatization has received attention from advocates on the left. In 2003 left-leaning political columnist and journalist Michael Kinsley wrote a second essay to appear in "Slate" on the topic. Kinsley's essay is titled "Abolish Marriage: Let's Really Get the Government out of Our Bedrooms." Kinsley follows the model set by his libertarian counterparts Boaz and McElroy; like Elder's he emphasizes marriage privatization's potential to end the controversy over same-sex marriage:
If marriage were an entirely private affair, all the disputes over gay marriage would become irrelevant. Gay marriage would not have the official sanction of government, but neither would straight marriage. There would be official equality between the two, which is the essence of what gays want and are entitled to. And if the other side is sincere in saying that its concern is not what people do in private, but government endorsement of a gay "lifestyle" or "agenda," that problem goes away, too.
Marriage privatization received attention from the legal scholar Alan Dershowitz in 2003 when Dershowitz wrote a "Los Angeles Times" editorial titled "To Fix Gay Dilemma, Government Should Quit the Marriage Business." More so than commentators from the right, Dershowitz frames his view on the topic in terms of church-state separation; unlike libertarian leaning discussions Dershowitz maintains that the state does have an interest in the secular rights of marriage. Dershowitz proposes that civil-unions as a secular replacement for state sanctioned marriage, be extended to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Under Dershowitz's conception of privatization, couples have a choice as to whether or not they wish to be married by a clergy willing to perform a marriage ceremony or to exclusively partake of secular/state-sanctioned civil unions. Dershowitz writes:
Not only would this solution be good for gays and for those who oppose gay marriage on religious grounds, it would also strengthen the wall of separation between church and state by placing a sacred institution entirely in the hands of the church while placing a secular institution under state control.
Public policy advocacy and academia.
In 2007 the Center for Inquiry, a secular think tank, released a position paper authored by analyst Ruth Mitchell titled "Same-Sex Marriage and Marriage". The paper argues from the separation of church and state that as long as marriage is available to heterosexual couples it ought to be equally available to LGBT couples. Nevertheless, the position paper claims that state endorsement of civil unions for both types of couples is the most appropriate policy in light of separation of church and state.
The argument for marriage privatization has also been formulated in academic scholarship. In 2008 an argument for marriage privatization appeared in the public policy journal "Public Affairs Quarterly". In that issue philosopher Lawrence Torcello offers a detailed model of marriage privatization based on the later political writings of the 20th century political philosopher John Rawls. The article is titled "Is The State Endorsement of Any Marriage Justifiable? Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions, and The Marriage Privatization Model.'
In the 1993 book "Political Liberalism", Rawls argues that arguments in a pluralistic society must be hashed out in terms that all members of that society can understand if not endorse. This means that in making public claims one must refrain from religious or otherwise controversial metaphysical claims that cannot, in principle, be equally endorsed by reasonable persons. In doing this, one is relying on what Rawls refers to as public reason.
In his article, Torcello claims that any state endorsement of marriage represents an inappropriate public endorsement of a comprehensive religious or otherwise metaphysical doctrine, which underlies any particular definition of marriage. Accordingly, taking public reason seriously leads to the idea that legalization of same-sex marriage may be just as neutrally unbalanced as its ban. In place of the public institute of marriage, Torcello, like Dershowitz, argues that civil unions providing the full extent of marital benefits under law ought to be instituted for both heterosexual and homosexual couples. According to the argument, such civil unions ought to replace the current legal institute of marriage. Once privatized, marriage is open for individuals to define and embrace or ignore as they see fit, within the scope of their private religious or philosophical belief systems:
No religious model that rejects same-sex marriage would be required to perform same-sex marriages under this privatized model. Under this model a couple, either heterosexual or homosexual, would obtain a civil union in order to have public and legal recognition of their partnership; they would have a private marriage ceremony if they so chose in order to honor their private religious or philosophical concept of marriage.
In a July 2008 article appearing in "The Monist" titled "Privatizing Marriage" Harvard Law Professor Cass Sunstein and University of Chicago economist Richard H. Thaler offer arguments for the privatization of marriage. Thaler and Sunstein also take up the topic in their co-authored 2008 book "Nudge: Improving Decisions about Wealth, Health, and Happiness." Sunstein and Thaler argue for marriage privatization among other positions under the heading of what they call "Libertarian Paternalism".
Arguments opposing the privatization of marriage.
Opposition to marriage privatization, like its endorsement, is equally likely to be found arising from conservative or progressive sources and a wide variety of objections are made.
Some opponents of marriage privatization can argue that such a policy will simply shift the current debate over same-sex marriage to civil unions.
Conservative religious opponents of same-sex marriage may feel that privatizing marriage is still a state endorsement of what they consider to be immoral unions between homosexual couples. Thus many of the same religious arguments aimed against same-sex marriage might be applied to marriage privatization as well. Conservative evangelical baptist R. Albert Mohler, Jr. has stated that he opposes the privatizaton of marriage because "markets do not always encourage or support moral behavior" and he believes the proposal would " marriage as a public institution."
Princeton professor Robert P. George has argued that marriage has an important cultural role in helping children develop into "basically honest, decent law abiding people of goodwill– citizens– who can take their rightful place in society". Thus, he concludes, "Family is built on marriage, and government- the state- has a profound interest in the integrity and well-being of marriage, and to write it off as if it were purely a religiously significant action and not an institution and action that has a profound public significance, would be a terrible mistake". This position is seconded by Jennifer Morse of the Witherspoon Institute, who argues that if literally anyone can define marriage as whatever they want, the state forfeits the ability to sufficiently secure the best interests of children. She goes further, arguing that the logic of marriage privatization "at the expense of children, is a concept developed by adults that will benefit only adults."
Stanley Kurtz of "National Review" has written that privatization would be a "disaster". He argued that government "still has to decide what sort of private unions merit benefits... under this privatization scheme", and then "we also get the same quarrels over social recognition that we got before privatization." He commented that the government will have to deal with polygamous, polyamorous, and incestuous relationships attempting to obtain contracts under the new scheme as well as attempts by heterosexual acquaintances to make "marriages of convenience" to obtain things such as spousal medical insurance. His "National Review" colleague Maggie Gallagher has also called privatization as a "fantasy" since "here is scarcely a dollar that state and federal government spends on social programs that is not driven in large part by family fragmentation: crime, poverty, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, school failure, mental and physical health problems."
Issues involved with privatizing marriage.
In general, a legal contract signed between two or more people will often include penalties for the severing of the contract by a party or parties. However, this generally does not apply to marriages in the US, which usually fall under the legal standard of no-fault divorce. It remains an open issue as to whether or not these quasi-marriage partnership contracts will be enforced with penalties.

Stenka-class patrol boat

The Stenka-class is the NATO reporting name for a class of patrol boats built for the Soviet Navy and Soviet Allies. The Soviet designation was Project 205P Tarantul (not to be confused with the Tarantul-class corvette). The boats are an anti-submarine patrol boat version of the Osa-class missile boat.
Design.
Project 205P Stenka is a variant of the Project 205 Osa missile boat. The Stenka used the hull of the Osa class and had a slightly larger crew. The development office of the "Alma" Shipyard in Leningrad used the standardized components of the Osa missile fast patrol boat, in order to develop an anti submarine boat. The anti ship missile launch containers were replaced by four torpedo tubes but the anti-ship missile related structures and equipment were retained. The living spaces in the Stenka were improved for long patrol endurance by raising the superstructure in order to create more usable space inside, compared to the Project 205 Osa missile boat. They also installed a more powerful air conditioner.
The drive system is three diesel radial engines of the type M504 B2 with a total capacity of 15,000 hp.
Armament.
The primary ASW weapon for combating submarines were SET-40 torpedoes. The boats has four 406-mm torpedo tubes installed on the deck in the aft part of the boats, two on the port side and two on starboard side.
Behind the torpedo tubes on the aft deck, in the port and starboard sides, are each one Abrollgestell depth charge launcher. Twelve depth charges, six for each launcher can be carried.
As the boats of the Project 205 Osa class, the Project 205P Stenka boats has two radar-controlled AK-230 30-mm twin guns, one in the bow, the other at the rear.
One of the boats was tested with a 57-mm gun AK-725 on the bow and received a modified project number - 205PE.
Sensors.
The 205P project air and surface search radar is a NATO "Pot Drum" MR-102 or a NATO "Peel Cone" "positive" - Radar installed on the mast, with two antennae for the NATO "High Pole B" friend or foe identification system. The NATO "Drum Tilt" type MR-104 radar is mounted on the rear of the superstructure For directing the fire of the two AK-230 guns. The ships have an MG-345 "Bronza" submarine search system fitted, consisting of a submersible Project 133.1 MG-329 "Sheksna" sonar with an MG-11 "Tamir-11" sonar sensor built into the fuselage.
Ships.
Soviet Navy.
A total of 114 or 117 (sources vary) boats were built between 1967 and 1990. They were operated by the Maritime Border Guard
The Soviet Union classified the boats of their border troops as "border guard ships" (Russian Пограничные сторожевые корабли (ПСКР)) and the five boats in the Navy as gunboats (Russian артиллерийский катер). A similar allocation of boats for submarine patrol are assigned into the border guards, which is rather unusual in NATO countries, and so the Project 205P patrol boat identification is used.

Tryphine

Saint Tryphine (also spelled Trifine, Triphine and Tréphine) is a semi-legendary Breton saint whose life is often considered to be the basis of the story of Bluebeard. In Brittany she is widely revered as a patron saint of sick children and those whose birth is overdue. The legend of Saint Tryphine probably derives from a historical individual who was the wife of the early Breton ruler Conomor.
Historical background.
Conomor is said to have married Tryphine, the daughter of his ally Waroch, but seems later to have violently abused and then murdered her. Conomor was later killed in battle with a rival, and became a legendary villain in Breton history. Tryphine was elevated to the position of a martyred saint, along with her son Tremeur, and there are many churches dedicated to them. The village of Sainte-Tréphine is named for the former.
Myth of Tryphine and Tremeur.
In later legend Conomor's villainy is extended to include the murders of three wives before Tryphine. Tryphine refuses to marry him because of his reputation, but when he threatens to invade her father's lands she agrees, to spare the lives of her father's people. While Conomor is away Tryphine finds a secret room containing relics of the deceased wives. She prays for their souls, and their ghosts appear to her warning her that Conomor will kill her if she becomes pregnant. Depending on the version of the myth this is either because a prophecy states that he will be killed by his own son or because he is only interested in his wives as providers of sexual pleasure. 
When he returns he discovers that she is pregnant. Tryphine escapes with magical aid from the dead wives and gives birth in a forest. She hides her son before Conomor catches her and beheads her. However Saint Gildas finds her and miraculously restores her to life. She and her son both live lives of saintly retirement, but after Tryphine's death Conomor eventually finds Tremeur and kills him. In other versions Conomor is killed when his castle miraculously collapses onto him. 
It has been suggested that the story of Bluebeard derives from this myth.
Myth of Tryphine and King Arthur.
The folklorist François-Marie Luzel collected a mystery play about Tryphine and King Arthur. In this story Arthur replaced Comonor as Tryphine's husband and Tryphine acquires some of the characteristics of Guinevere. The plot involves Tryphine's evil brother, Kervoura, who schemes to inherit the kingdom from Arthur. When he discovers that Tryphine is pregnant, he decides to eliminate Arthur's bloodline. As Tryphine is about to give birth, Kevoura kidnaps her and hides the child. He then accuses Tryphine of murdering her son and uses forged evidence to implicate her in a supposed plot to kill Arthur. Arthur orders Tryphine's arrest, but she escapes and hides for six years working as a servant. She is eventually discovered and brought back to court. Arthur now accepts her innocence and they have a daughter together. Kervoura then accuses her of adultery, using bribed witnesses. She is condemned to be executed. However her son Tremeur has now grown up and has escaped from his captors to return. He reveals himself just as Tryphine is about to be beheaded by the executioner and challenges Kervoura to a duel. He kills Kervoura, who confesses his crimes before he dies. Arthur and Tryphine are reunited.

Sandeep Unnikrishnan

Sandeep Unnikrishnan (15 March 1977 – 28 November 2008) was a Major in the Indian Army serving in the elite Special Action Group of the National Security Guards (NSG). He was killed in action while fighting terrorists in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. His bravery was honoured with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest peace time gallantry award, on 26 January 2009.
“Do not come up, I will handle them”, were the last words which Major Unnikrishnan told his men as he was hit by bullets while engaging terrorists inside the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower during Operation Black Tornado, according to NSG officials.
Later, NSG sources clarified that when a Guardsman got injured during the operation, Major Unnikrishnan arranged for his evacuation and started chasing the terrorists himself. The terrorists escaped to another floor of the hotel and during the chase Major Unnikrishnan was seriously injured and succumbed to his injuries.
Family.
Sandeep Unnikrishnan came from a Nair family residing in Bangalore, where they had moved to from Cheruvannur, Kozhikode District, Kerala. He was the only son of retired ISRO officer K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi Unnikrishnan.
Childhood.
Unnikrishnan spent 14 years at the Frank Anthony Public School, Bangalore, graduating in 1995 in the ISC Science stream. A popular figure among his contemporaries, he wanted to join the Army, even attending school in a crew cut. His peers and teachers recalled him as being a good athlete who was active in school activities and sports events. He was also a member of the school choir, and very interested in movies.
Army career.
Sandeep joined the National Defence Academy (NDA), Pune, Maharashtra in 1995. He was a cadet, part of the Oscar Squadron (No. 4 Battalion) and a graduate of the 94th Course of NDA. He graduated as a Bachelor of Arts (Social science stream). 
His NDA friends remember him as "selfless", "generous" and "calm and composed".
His happy-go-lucky face masked a ruthless and determined soldier, so did his thin physique hide a tough, never-give-up spirit that was seen in various training camps and cross country races he participated in with in the NDA.
He was commissioned as Lieutenant to the 7th Battalion of the Bihar Regiment (Infantry) on 12 July 1999. After serving the Indian Army in different locations in Jammu & Kashmir and Rajasthan to counter insurgencies for two terms, he was selected to join the National Security Guards. On completion of training, he was assigned to the Special Action Group (SAG) of NSG on January 2007 and participated in various operations of the NSG. He was a popular officer who was loved and adored by his seniors and juniors alike. During the 'Ghatak course' (at the Commando Wing (Infantry School), Belgaum), the most difficult course of the Army, Major Unnikrishnan topped the course, earning an "Instructor Grading" and commendation from seniors. Perhaps this was the reason or his passion for bravery that he opted for the NSG commando service which he joined on deputation in 2006.
During Operation Vijay in July 1999 he showed grit and determination at the forward posts in the face of heavy artillery firing and small arms fire by Pakistan troops.
On the evening of 31 December 1999, Major Sandeep led a team of six soldiers and managed to establish a post 200 metres from the enemy and under direct enemy observation and fire.
Operation Black Tornado.
On the night of 26 Nov 2008, several iconic buildings in South Mumbai were attacked by terrorists. One of the buildings where the terrorists held people hostage was the 100-year old Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Major Unnikrishnan was the team commander of 51 SAG deployed in the operation at the Taj Mahal Hotel to rid the building of terrorists and rescue the hostages. He entered the hotel in a group of 10 commandos and reached the sixth floor through the staircase. As the team descended the stairs, they sensed the terrorists on the third floor. The terrorists had held a few women as hostages in a room and locked it from the inside. After breaking open the door, the round of fire by the terrorists hit Commando Sunil Yadav, who was Major Unnikrishnan's partner. 
Major Unnikrishan led his team from the front and engaged the terrorists in a fierce gunfight. He arranged for Commando Sunil Yadav's evacuation and regardless of personal safety, chased the terrorists who, meanwhile, escaped to another floor of the hotel, and while doing so Major Sandeep continuously engaged them. In the encounter that followed, he was shot from the back, seriously injured and succumbed to injuries.
Funeral.
At Unnikrishnan's funeral, mourners shouted “Long Live Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan“, “Sandeep Unnikrishnan Amar Rahee”. Thousands lined up outside the Bangalore house of the NSG Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan to pay their respects. The funeral of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan was held with full military honours.
Controversy.
Nobody represented the Kerala government in Major Unnikrishnan's funeral. Local and national media criticized the decision of the politicians. However the then Chief Minister of Kerala V. S. Achuthanandan and Home Minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan called on the Unnikrishnan's family on 30 November 2008. Sandeep's father K. Unnikrishnan was angry, criticized the visit and asked them to leave. He even threatened to commit suicide if any politician from Kerala entered his home. When V.S. Achuthanandan visited his home, Unnikrishnan roared at the Chief Minister and his delegation and said that "No dog would enter my house". Later, V. S. Achuthanandan told media that had it not been for Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, not even a dog would have visited his parents' house. This again invited harsh criticism from the media and public. However, Achuthanandan stated that he would not apologize to the Major's family. He added that he respects the slain Major's family.
On 2 December 2008, Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary Prakash Karat expressed his apology for Achuthanandan's 'dog remark'. On 3 December 2008, Achuthanandan expressed his regrets over the incident.

Wike's law of low odd primes

Wike's law of low odd primes is a methodological principle to help design sound experiments in psychology. It is: "If the number of experimental treatments is a low odd prime number, then the experimental design is unbalanced and partially confounded" (Wike, 1973, pp. 192–193).
This law was stated by Edwin Wike in a humorous article in which he also admits that the association of his name with the law is an example of Stigler's law of eponymy.
The lowest odd prime number is three. Wike illustrates how this yields an unbalanced design with an invented study in which researchers investigated the effects on sexual satisfaction of water beds. The fictitious researchers randomly assigned couples to three groups: those having sex on a conventional bed, those having sex on a water bed, and those having sex on a water bed having also taken a sea sickness pill. Wike pointed out that any differences in sexual satisfaction among the three groups could be due to the water bed or to the sea sickness pill. It requires a fourth group, couples taking the pill and using a conventional bed, to balance the design and to allow the researchers to attribute any differences in sexual satisfaction among the groups to the sort of bed, to the pill, or to their interaction.

The organization's members consist of both individuals and institutions that are interested in improving library services to Native American people in any type of library in the United States.
History.
The American Indian Library Association was officially established in 1979 as a result of the Indian White House Pre-Conference of 1978 on Indian Library and Information Services On or Near Reservations. This Pre-Conference took place in Denver, CO, and its focus was on the amelioration of library services and resources to American Indians. The individuals who attended the meeting represented a number of Indian tribes from different parts of the United States. The initial "idea" of such an organization began in the early 1970s, however. In 1971, at the ALA's Annual Conference in Dallas, TX, Lotsee Patterson, Charles Townley, and Virginia Matthews formed a Task Force on American Indians within the Social Responsibilities Round Table and held an initial meeting. Around the same time, the ALA Advisory Committee in the Office for Library Service to the Disadvantaged created the Committee on Library Service for American Indian People, in which Charles Townley served as the first chair. Additional issues that influenced the creation of the organization were the implementation of tribal libraries and changes in United States federal law that reflected the increasing concern regarding the inadequacy of library services to American Indians. The AILA held its first meeting as an individual entity in New York during the ALA's 1980 Annual Conference, its constitution was passed the following year during the Annual Conference in San Francisco and, in 1985, the ALA Executive Board finally approved the AILA as an affiliate during the ALA Annual Conference in Chicago, IL.
Membership.
Annual membership costs $40 for organizations (such as libraries, tribal governments, or other institutions), while individuals must pay $20 and students must pay $10. Membership includes a subscription to the "American Indian Libraries" Semi-Annual Newsletter and "AILA-L", a discussion group for all AILA members. Members are also encouraged to join one or more of the committees listed below.
Governing Structure.
The AILA is governed by an Executive Board, which meets annually and delegates to the Association's committees that are listed below. The Board enables those committees to both develop and implement programs and activities that are in accordance with the Executive Board's policies. The current 2008-2009 President and Vice-President of the Association are Susan Hanks and Liana Juliano, respectively.
Committees.
Current ad hoc AILA committees include the Budget and Finance Committee, By-Laws and Constitution Committee, Children's Literature Award Committee, Communications and Publications Committee, Development and Fundraising Committee, Distinguished Service Award Committee, Nominating Committee, Programming Committee, Subject Access and Classification Committee, and the Scholarship Review Board.
Goals.
According to Loriene Roy's "Retaining Cultural Identity in a Transformed Future: the American Indian Library Association Response to ALA Goal 2000," as excerpted onto the AILA's official website, the American Indian Library Association:
Activities.
The AILA participates in a multitude of programs, awards, outreach services, conferences, and publications. Below is a list of those that are quite prominent and notable.

Mirusha waterfalls

The Mirusha waterfalls (; ) are a series of waterfalls found in the Miruša River, a tributary of the White Drin, in Kosovo. The waterfalls have, over time, created canyons and caves, which are famous throughout Kosovo. The river has carved a long canyon and has created 13 river lakes with waterfalls between them, which has earned them the name of "Plitvice of Metohija", referring to the more famous waterfalls in Croatia. The waterfalls are one of the most visited attractions of the area and people often go for a swim. The walls around the waterfalls are white in colour, whereas the water from the Miruša river is a dirty brown. The waterfalls caves are also popular with visitors. The highest waterfall, between the sixth and seventh lake, is high.

Shershen-class torpedo boat

The "Shershen"-class was the NATO reporting name for a class of torpedo boats built for the Soviet Navy and allies. The Soviet designation was "Project 206 Shtorm".
Development.
Designated as TKAs (ru. "Torpednyy Kater"; eng. "Torpedo Cutter"), the Project 183 boats were designed as simple fast attack craft suitable for cheap manufacture and easy maintenance. Intended as a successor to the Project 183 "Bolshevik" torpedo boats, development of the new class started in 1956. Like other similar boats, they were to be used near the coast, in good weather and under friendly air cover.
The first boat was completed at the Yaroslalv Shipyard and commissioned with the Soviet Navy in October 1960. Production was also organized at the Sredne-Nevskiy and Sosnovskiy Shipyard with a total of 80 boats being built at all three shipyards. A simplified export version was designated Project 206E (NATO designation Mol).
Description.
"Shershen"-class boats measure in length, with a beam and a draft of . Standard displacement measures while full displacements varies from , depending on source and ship configuration.
Propulsion is based on three M-503A diesel engines putting out each, mounted on three shafts. Maximum achievable speed is . With a sustainable speed of "Shershens" have a range of and if traveling at a cruising speed of . Electricity is also provided by three 28 KW diesel generators. The boats have an autonomy of up to five days and can load of fuel. The crew is made of 20-21 men, including two officers.
Principal armament of the class consisted of four OTA-53-206M torpedo tubes located on the sides. The 533 mm torpedos were ejected by a powder charge and, depending on version, had a rudimentary homing ability or were straight run only. Surface search and targeting information for the torpedo attack was obtained by the MR-102 "Baklan" (NATO designation: "Pot Drum") radar with a search range of . Defensive armament is made of two AK-230 CIWS located on the bow and the stern, guided by the MR-104 "Rys" (NATO designation: "Drum Tilt") radar with a maximum tracking range of . Secondary armament that could be carried included twelve BB-1 depth charges or six naval mines.
Users.
Project 206.
A total of 87 boats were built for the Soviet Navy between 1960 and 1970. The boats were built at yards in Zelenodolsk and Yaroslavl
Project 206 boats were exported to:
Project 206E.
A simplified version, "Project 206E", known to NATO as the Mol class, was built for export. One boat was retained by the Soviets to train foreign crews.

Geography of the North Sea

The geography of the North Sea studies coastal and submarine features as well as the people who live on its coasts. It is bounded by the east coasts of England and Scotland to the west and the northern and central European mainland to the east and south, including Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. In the south-west, beyond the Straits of Dover, the North Sea becomes the English Channel. In the east, it connects to the Baltic Sea via the Skagerrak and Kattegat, narrow straits that separate Denmark from Norway and Sweden respectively. In the north, it opens in a widening funnel shape to the Norwegian Sea, which lies in the very north-eastern part of the Atlantic.
Extent.
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the North Sea as follows:
"On the Southwest." A line joining the Walde Lighthouse (France, 1°55'E) and Leathercoat Point (England, 51°10'N).
"On the Northwest." From Dunnet Head (3°22'W) in Scotland to Tor Ness (58°47'N) in the Island of Hoy, thence through this island to the Kame of Hoy (58°55'N) on to Breck Ness on Mainland (58°58'N) through this island to Costa Head (3°14'W) and to Inga Ness (59'17'N) in Westray through Westray, to Bow Head, across to Mull Head (North point of Papa Westray) and on to Seal Skerry (North point of North Ronaldsay) and thence to Horse Island (South point of the Shetland Islands).
"On the North." From the North point (Fethaland Point) of the Mainland of the Shetland Islands, across to Graveland Ness (60°39'N) in the Island of Yell, through Yell to Gloup Ness (1°04'W) and across to Spoo Ness (60°45'N) in Unst island, through Unst to Herma Ness (60°51'N), on to the SW point of the Rumblings and to Muckle Flugga () all these being included in the North Sea area; thence up the meridian of 0°53' West to the parallel of 61°00' North and eastward along this parallel to the coast of Norway, the whole of Viking Bank being thus included in the North Sea.
"On the East." The Western limit of the Skagerrak line joining Hanstholm () and the Naze (Lindesnes, ).
Submarine topography.
The seabed is separated into three bathymetric areas, the Norwegian Trench and the north and south North Sea separated by the Dogger Bank.
For the most part, the sea lies on the European continental shelf. The only exception is the Norwegian trench, which reaches from the Stad peninsula in Sogn og Fjordane to the Oslofjord. The trench is between wide and hundreds of metres deep. Off the Rogaland coast, it is 250–300 m (820–980 ft) deep, and at its deepest point, off Arendal, it reaches 700 m (2300 ft) deep as compared to the average depth of the North Sea, about 100 m (325 ft). The trench is not a subduction-related oceanic trench, where one tectonic plate is being forced under another. It is mainly a deep erosional scour, while the western part follows the North-South line of an old rift valley formed during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
To the east of Great Britain, lies the Dogger Bank, a vast moraine, or accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris, which rises up to 15 to 30 m (50–100 ft) deep.
The Silver Pit is a hollow or valley-like depression that has been recognised since about 1843 by fishermen. Nearby is the Silverpit crater, a controversial structure initially proposed to be an impact crater, though another interpretation is that it may result from the dissolution of a thick bed of salt which permitted the upper strata to collapse. The Devil's Hole is a group of trenches east of Dundee, Scotland which are up to deep. 
"The Long Forties" denotes a principal raised bank about in length that is between deep. It is located parallel to the shore of Scotland between Kinnaird's Head and Aberdeen. The Broad Fourteens are a sand bar ridge between eleven and fourteen fathoms (20 m and 26 m) deep located off the Flemish and Danish coasts.

Downchild Blues Band

The Downchild Blues Band is a Canadian blues band, described by one reviewer as "the premier blues band in Canada". The band is still commonly known as the Downchild Blues Band, though the actual band name was shortened to "Downchild" as of the early 1980s.
History.
Early History: 1969-1982.
"(Donnie) Walsh has been called the 'father of Canadian blues' and with good reason. He is a blues pioneer on the Canadian scene. It was Walsh who paid the highest dues so that later Canadian blues acts, such as the Jeff Healey Band, the Colin James Band, the Powder Blues, Sue Foley, The Sidemen and The Highliners could also enjoy their success. The Canadian blues scene, which has blossomed nicely in the last few years, was relatively barren in the late 1960s when The Downchild Blues Band first started out."
"Don't ever forget where the blues came from, or why."
"Never forget why you play the blues; if it was to make big money, you probably won't."
The Downchild Blues Band was formed in Toronto in 1969 and continues to perform today. It was co-founded by two brothers, Donnie ("Mr. Downchild") Walsh and Richard ("Hock") Walsh. The band's international fame is partially due to three of its songs, the originals "I've Got Everything I Need (Almost)" and "Shot Gun Blues", and its adaptation of "Flip, Flop and Fly", all from its 1973 album, "Straight Up", being featured on the first Blues Brothers album, "Briefcase Full of Blues" (1978). "Flip, Flop and Fly" has been Downchild's only hit single, and became the signature song of Hock Walsh. The band's musical style is described as being "a spirited, if fundamental, brand of jump-band and Chicago-style blues".
The band name came from the Sonny Boy Williamson II song, "Mr. Downchild". The initial band membership was Donnie ("Mr. Downchild") Walsh, who remains the sole constant band member, with younger brother Rick "Hock" Walsh on vocals, accompanied by Dave Woodward, Cash Wall, John Tanti and Jim Milne. They were the house band at the fabled Grossman's Tavern from 1968–1970, managed briefly by former folk musician, Ron Gerston. Classically-trained pianist Jane Vasey joined the band in 1973.
The initial blues musical influence on Donnie Walsh was Jimmy Reed. He was later greatly influenced by James Cotton, both in terms of musical style and band format. Walsh and Cotton later became personal friends. Donnie Walsh described these early influences as follows: "Jimmy Reed. I heard him at my girlfriend’s birthday party. Some guys brought a Jimmy Reed album over and that was it, for me. ...I’d put him on the record player, and when I went to sleep at night, it would still be playing when I’d get up in the morning. Then I’d play him all day, and it was unreal. Then, of course, I spread out to Sonny Boy Williamson, Little Walter, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, and Albert King. Then, I got a job in a record store. A blues record store that stocked 45s only. All alphabetical all around the whole room. You’d go to the Muddy Waters section, and there would be eight Muddy Waters singles. You’d go to the Sonny Boy Williamson section, and there would be five Sonny Boy Williamson singles."
The band's first album, "Bootleg", is regarded as one of the first independent albums ever produced in Canada. It was recorded over two nights in 1971, in a makeshift studio at Toronto's Rochdale College. Donnie Walsh and others distributed the album by hand. It was welcomed by major Toronto music retailer Sam Sniderman, of Sam The Record Man renown, who was very much disposed to promoting Canadian music. The record was soon acquired by RCA Records Canada for more general distribution.
According to Donnie Walsh, more than 120 musicians have been associated with Downchild since its 1969 founding. The band has never lost its focus on blues music. While certain band members have left to pursue what was perceived to be a more lucrative rock music career, Donnie Walsh has a different perspective: "Just around when I started here were all these guys in blues bands and of course they were impatient and they wanted to make some more money so they became rock bands. I played the blues then and I play the blues now. That's what I love. ... It's a living thing, it's living music. By living and breathing it goes on and what that means is that instead of being the same kind of music somebody else wrote years ago, it lives and evolves. Blues is serious stuff, it's a heavy kind of music in your soul. You show up with the blues I play, you lighten up. That's what it's all about. It's like medicine."
1982-1990: Vasey, Hock and Flaim Gone.
In 1982, the band suffered a major setback with the untimely death of keyboard player Jane Vasey, who succumbed to leukemia at the age of thirty two. Donnie Walsh, who was living with Vasey at the time, took a period of time off to reflect on his future and that of the band. The band came back in the fall of 1982, with both a new singer and a new keyboard player, by way of a live recording from Toronto's historic El Mocambo club, "But I'm On The Guest List".
Despite being closely identified with the band's initial sound and also being the co-writer, with brother Donnie Walsh, of "Shot Gun Blues", later recorded by the Blues Brothers, Hock Walsh would leave, rejoin and be replaced as lead singer in the band on several occasions. He was first fired from the band in 1974, shortly before work began on the band's third album, "Dancin"'. At that time, he was replaced by Tony Flaim. Hock rejoined the band in 1977 and 1985. He was fired by his brother Donnie for a final time in 1990, and replaced by Chuck Jackson. Chuck Jackson has remained the lead singer of Downchild since that time. 
Notwithstanding their strained relationship, Donnie Walsh assessed his brother's ability as follows: "He was a fabulous singer; he could sing the blues better than anybody I've ever heard. He had the timing, the phrasing, a fabulous voice… he was just great." Hock Walsh died on December 31, 1999, at the age of 51, of an apparent heart attack. Performing on his own and with his own bands since 1990, he had been scheduled to perform a New Year's Eve concert with blues singer Rita Chiarelli. His last recordings were three tracks on "4 Blues", the 1998 debut album of Toronto's Big Daddy G Review. 
Tony Flaim, the initial replacement for Hock Walsh in Downchild and featured on six of the band's albums, also died of a heart attack, on March 10, 2000, less than three months after Hock Walsh. He was 52. Flaim's near nine year association with Downchild covered most of the 1975 to 1982 period, including a period when Hock Walsh rejoined the band in 1977, plus 1986 to 1988. He was succeeded by a returning Hock Walsh, who was fired by his brother for a final time in 1990. During the 1982-1986 period, Flaim was replaced by John Witmer, former lead singer of the well-respected Toronto blues band Whiskey Howl, while Hock Walsh rejoined the band for a brief period in 1985. One of Tony Flaim's last public performances was at a tribute to the late Hock Walsh, in February 2000, at Toronto's Horseshoe Tavern.
1990-Present.
Most of the current lineup has been together since 1990, when Chuck Jackson (vocals) and Michael Fonfara (keyboards) joined Donnie Walsh (guitar and harmonica) and Pat Carey (sax). Sax player Pat Carey was the first to join the current Downchild lineup, in 1985, a year after arriving in Toronto and commencing his Toronto musical career playing with both Hock Walsh and Tony Flaim. Bass player Gary Kendall joined Downchild for a second time in 1995, after first playing with the band during the 1979-1983 period. They were later joined by drummer Mike Fitzpatrick, who first recorded with the band on the "Come On In" album (2004).
Recent accolades include a Juno Award nomination for "Blues Album of The Year" in 2005, plus winning the Maple Blues Award as "Entertainers of The Year" in both 2005 and 2006. In addition, the band's connection to The Blues Brothers has continued. In 2005, when Dan Aykroyd and James Belushi toured as The Blues Brothers, Donnie Walsh joined them onstage at Ontario's Casino Rama. Donnie Walsh's song, "I've Got Everything I Need (Almost)" was recently selected as one of 125 "essential" Canadian songs, and the only blues song on the list.
The band was the headliner at the 2009 Railway Blues and Bluegrass Festival, inn Cookstown, Ontario, in September 2009.

China Cotton Association

China Cotton Association (CCA) is a China non-profit federation in the area of cotton, which is voluntarily established by cotton farmers, cotton farmers' cooperative organizations, enterprises engaged in cotton production, purchase, processing and operation, cotton textile enterprises, cotton research institutes and other organs and which accepts the supervision and management of the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs and the professional guidance of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.
Function of CCA.
The CCA is made up of players from the cotton sector, cotton farm groups, those in the cotton production sector, buyers, sub-contractors, vendors, exporters, warehousing companies, the clothing industry and cotton research organisations. 
Members of the association are either organisations or businesses working in the cotton sector that wish to participate in a Chinese consultation structure. Set up in September 2003, the association has since actively developed numerous service and conciliation activities, set up a code of ethics and internal regulations as well as professional protection services within the sector. 
The association has become one of the major partners and an important relay between official organisations, governmental structures and agricultural and industrial players in the Chinese cotton sector. 
It is a major player in the steady and stable development of the Chinese cotton sector. In relation to international trade, over the last four years it has established numerous working relationships and many regular exchanges with organisations in the cotton trade and industry in the main producer and cotton buying countries worldwide.
Industry.
Chinese cotton sector.
Chinese cotton production in 2006 related to a planted area of nearly five and a half million hectares (5,410,000 hectares), i.e. eighty one million ‘mous’ (a ‘mou’ is the traditional area unit used in rural China, which is about a fifteenth of a hectare ) (81,130,000 ‘mous’). According to the official Chinese Statistics Office figures, production in 2006 was 6,730,000 tonnes. Of this, a third of the production came from the Xinjiang province, 2,180,000 tonnes. Based on these production figures, it is estimated that it was needed to import 4,300,000 tonnes of cotton in order to meet the demand, but in fact between September 2006 and August 2007 (which is the annual cotton season in China) the country only had to import 2,280,000 tonnes of cotton, i.e. 47% less than predicted. Two million tonnes less than predicted. Actual production in Xinjiang was over 3,200,000 tonnes of cotton. Production in China is in the region of 7,700,000 tonnes. 
Mill production is increasing quite rapidly. According the Chinese Statistics Office, between September 2006 and August 2007 China produced 19,030,000 tonnes of yarn. It is up 18.8%, but is however an increase that is 8 points down on the same period in the previous year.
According to a study undertaken by the Chinese Cotton Association, in 2007 in China the planted area of cotton was 82,600,000 ‘mous’ (around 5 and a half million hectares), a slight increase on the previous year. Production forecasts anticipate production remaining stable against the previous year, with perhaps a slight increase to reach around 7,700,000 tonnes once again.
Demand in China is constantly increasing. Specialists estimate that textile production for 2007 will continue to grow. It is thought that the production of cotton thread will increase 10% to reach around 21 million tonnes. With a cotton requirement of 12 million tonnes, China needs to import around 4 million tonnes of cotton.

Jigdal Dagchen Sakya

Jigdal Dagchen Sakya Rinpoche (; alt. "Jigchai Dagqên Sa'gya Rinboqê"; born November 2, 1929) is a Tibetan Buddhist teacher educated in the Sakya sect. He was educated to be the head of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism as well as the successor to the throne of Sakya, the third most important political position in Tibet in early times. Dagchen Rinpoche is in the twenty-sixth generation of the Sakya-Khon lineage descended from Kön Gönqog Gyäbo and is regarded as an embodiment of Manjushri as well as the rebirth of a Sakya from the Ngor sub-school, Ewam Luding Khenchen (The Great Abbot from the Luding family)
Gyase Chökyi Nyima.
Dagchen is a title meaning “Lineage Holder.” Among his followers he is known as Dagchen Rinpoche, or simply as Rinpoche (“Precious One”). His formal title of “His Holiness” indicates the high degree of esteem with which the Tibetan Buddhist community holds him.
He immigrated in 1960 to the United States with his family, one of the first groups Tibetans-in-exile in North
America. He is the first Head of the Sakya Order of Tibetan Buddhism to live in the United States. From the Sakya Monastery of Tibetan Buddhism in Seattle, Washington, and its precursor (which he co-founded in 1974), he has taught and preserved Tibetan culture and religion. Because he is also a non-sectarian master within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, he has defined Sakya Monastery as a non-denominational and ecumenical center for teachings about Tibetan Buddhism. His work has also included the foundation of Tibetan Buddhist communities overseas in India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Nepal, Bhutan, and Southeast Asia, and teaching at Buddhist centers around the world.
Life.
Education and Early Adulthood.
Dagchen Rinpoche was tutored by the abbot of the South Monastery of Sakya and by the Secretary of the Sakya Government. With these two teachers, Rinpoche studied the Tibetan alphabet, composition, classical literature, philosophy, and the Four Classes of Tantra (esoteric Buddhism). He also received teachings on the Sakya meditation deities. From Pönlop Sakya of the North Monastery, Dagchen Rinpoche learned the fundamental esoteric religious rites of the Sakya tradition: religious music, mandala offering, dancing, and ritual hand gestures.
After having successfully completed this training, Dagchen Rinpoche received from his father
the Sakya-Khon lineage transmission of Vajrakilaya (a meditational deity whose name
means the “Dagger of Indestructible Reality”), and the complete Lamdré Tsokshey (The Path
and Its Fruit in its more esoteric form), which is the main teaching of the Sakya tradition.
Thus, Rinpoche’s primary spiritual teacher was his father, Trichen
Nawang Thutop Wangchuk.
In 1950, at age 21, Dagchen Rinpoche married Sonam Tsezom, who descends from a family
of lamas and doctors of East Tibet (Kham). She is the niece of the Deshung Rinpoche III. When she married her name became Jamyang and her title Dagmo Kusho or, more formally, Dagmo Kushola, which roughly translates as: "mother of a prince."
Later that year Dagchen Rinpoche’s father died. Rinpoche became the interim Throne-holder. Concurrently, Communist Chinese invaders were threatening Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism. After a short reign as the head of the Sakya sect, he
took a leave of absence as ruler of Sakya in order to travel to East Tibet to complete his religious education.
In East Tibet, Dagchen Rinpoche received teachings from fourteen lamas. Among them
were his root lamas, Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. They were renowned non-sectarian lamas, of the Sakya and
Nyingma traditions, respectively. From Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö Rinpoche, Dagchen
Rinpoche received initiations and teachings of the Sakya School’s most valued teaching,
the seven-volume Lamdré Lopshey (The Path and Its Fruit in its more esoteric form) and
the fourteen-volume Druptap Kundu (Collection of Methods of Realization). From Dilgo
Khyentse Rinpoche, Dagchen Rinpoche received teachings on the thirteen-volume
Damngak Dzö (Treasury of Esoteric Instructions), a non-sectarian compilation by
Jamgön Kongtrul, a great non-sectarian master of Tibetan Buddhism from the Kagyu
School. Additionally, twelve other Sakya lamas gave him the teachings from the thirty-one
volume Gyude Kundu.
Emigration to the United States.
In 1959, due to the Communist Chinese invasion of Tibet, Dagchen Rinpoche and his
family (including his younger brother Trinly Rinpoche and his wife’s uncle Deshung Rinpoche
III) fled to Bhutan and then to India. Professor Turrell V. Wylie from the Tibetan Studies
Program at the University of Washington, the first such program in the country, invited
Dagchen Rinpoche to participate in a research project on Tibet sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. This enabled Dagchen Rinpoche to bring his family to Seattle, Washington in
1960. The research project funding lasted for three years. Following that, over the next decade
Rinpoche held several positions at the University of Washington, including working in the
Anthropology Department and at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.
A Non-Sectarian Seattle Lama.
In 1974 Dagchen Rinpoche co-founded, with Deshung Rinpoche III, his wife’s uncle, the
original Sakya Dharma Center in Seattle called Sakya Tegchen Choling. In 1984, the group adopted the name of Sakya Monastery of Tibetan
Buddhism.
For the purpose of the preservation of Tibetan culture and religion, Dagchen Rinpoche has
overseen the religious activities and administration of the Monastery since its
inception. His spiritual leadership takes various forms: leading meditations, giving teachings
and empowerments (spiritual initiations), conducting refuge ceremonies in which people
formally become Buddhists, and holding special services upon request. Now that the Monastery is completed, Dagchen Rinpoche is placing greater emphasis on
education. The Virupa Educational Institute is devoted to the study of Tibetan Buddhism,
Buddhism in general, religions, cultures, and sciences from around the world. Non-sectarianism
and education are major components to Rinpoche’s teaching, in keeping with the beliefs of his
root lamas. Sakya Monastery in Seattle has hosted visits from leading lamas of the four schools
of Tibetan Buddhism, including H. H. the Dalai Lama.
Dagchen Rinpoche’s interest in ecumenism stems from his training as a non-sectarian master,
and his experience as an immigrant who came to this country seeking religious freedom. Like His Holiness The
Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Rinpoche encourages inter-religious and interdisciplinary meetings
and encounters for Tibetan Buddhists. He regularly travels to teach in Asia, Europe, Canada,
and throughout the United States.
Ancestry.
Ancestors.
Lineage is important in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, and Dagchen Rinpoche’s lineage
is revered. It extends more than thousand years. His father was
Trichen (“Great Throne-holder”) Nawang Tutop Wangchuk, the last great throne-holder of the
Sakya Order of Tibetan Buddhism in Tibet, and his mother was Gyalyum (“Mother of the Khön
Children”) Dechen Drolma.
Dagchen Rinpoche’s family lineage is considered divine because family records and Tibetan
histories state that his family is descended from celestial beings from the realm of heavenly clear
light. Five generations of these celestial beings are said to have lived in Tibet. A famous ancestor
of his from the late eighth century was Khön Lu’i Wangpo (Nagendrarakshita), one of the first
seven Tibetans ordained as a Buddhist monk, a noted translator, and a personal disciple of
Padmasambhava (who erected the very first Tibetan Buddhist monastery called Samye). Since the
11th century, the Sakya male progenies are also regarded as emanations of Manjushri, the
Bodhisattva of Wisdom; Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva of Compassion; or Vajrapani, Bodhisattva
of Power.
The Sakya Name.
In 1042, Atisha, the great Indian Buddhist master who helped revive Buddhism in
Tibet, was traveling in Tibet spreading the Buddha’s teachings. At the side of a mountain
where there was “pale earth,” he foresaw the emanations of three bodhisattvas whom he
knew would spread the Buddhist doctrine in Tibet: Avalokiteshvara (the embodiment of
compassion), Manjushri (the embodiment of infinite wisdom), and Vajrapani (the
embodiment of infinite power).
It was at the same site of pale earth some thirty years later, in 1073, that Khön Gönchok
Gyalpo (1034–1102), ancestor of Dagchen Rinpoche, built the first Sakya Monastery. The
monastery took its name from the pale earth (in Tibetan “sa-kya”) where the monastery was
founded. Subsequently, the town that arose there, the family of the monastery’s founder (the
Khön lineage), and the school of Tibetan Buddhism took the name of the monastery: Sakya.
The Sakya name is also renowned for having lamas as rulers of Tibet. The Sakya patriarch,
Chogyal Pakpa (1235–1280) was given temporal authority over Tibet through the patronage of
the Mongol rulers of China. Subsequently, the Sakya lamas governed Tibet for over 90 years.
The Sakya School is one of the four great Schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The Sakya
masters developed a tradition that emphasized study and meditation in equal measure.

El Rancho Hotel and Casino

The El Rancho Hotel and Casino was a hotel and casino that operated on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada from 1948 to 1992. It was known as The Thunderbird Hotel from its opening to 1976, and The Silverbird from 1977 to 1981.
History.
Thunderbird.
On September 1, 1948, the Thunderbird Hotel was the fourth resort to open on the Las Vegas Strip. The resort was built by developer Marion Hicks and owned by Lieutenant Governor of Nevada Clifford A. Jones. The resort had a Native American theme and featured portraits, a Navajo-based restaurant, the only bowling alley ever on the Strip, and a showroom. In 1955, articles surfaced in the Las Vegas Sun saying that Meyer Lansky and other underworld figures held hidden shares in the hotel.
In 1964, the casino was purchased by Del Webb for $10 million. He ran the resort until 1972, when he sold it to Caesars World, owner of Caesars Palace, for $13.6 million. A $150-million, 2,000-room resort called the Mark Anthony was planned for the site, but Caesars was unable to find financing, and sold the property four years later to banker E. Parry Thomas at a loss of $5.7 million. Thomas later sold it to Major Riddle, owner of the Dunes Hotel, who renamed the resort as the Silverbird in 1976.
The Thunderbird has the distinction of being the resort where singer Rosemary Clooney made her first appearance in Las Vegas in 1951, and where Judy Garland made her final Vegas appearance in 1965.
The Silverbird.
The Silverbird opened on January 1, 1977. Four years later, Major Riddle sold the resort to Ed Torres, who also owned the Aladdin Hotel and Casino. Torres renamed the Silverbird to the El Rancho, named after the nearby El Rancho Vegas, which burnt down in 1960.
El Rancho Casino.
On August 31, 1982, the El Rancho Casino opened its doors. According to the Gaming Control Board, the owner, Ed Torres had close ties with some of the most notorious crime characters of the time. However, this did not restrict him from owning a gaming license. Rodney Dangerfield opened the "Rodney's Place" comedy club inside the El Rancho in 1982.
The El Rancho Casino closed on July 6, 1992. For several years the marquee claimed that El Rancho's Countryland USA would be coming soon, which called for two, 20-story cowboy boot-shaped hotel towers. That project never came to be and the property was sold to Las Vegas Entertainment Network Inc. They failed to reopen it and sold it to International Thoroughbred Breeders Corp., founded by notorious penny-stock operator Robert E. Brennan.
Other plans for the site have included a project slated as Starship Orion, a Star Wars-like casino-resort, but all the proposed projects fell through, or were not approved. KVBC News 3 of Las Vegas did an investigation into rumors of ghosts, and discovered that most of the structure was rotten, with a handful of operating slot machines, and some rooms totally renovated and maintained. This report led to the state ordering Turnberry Associates to consider a purchase of the property. In 2000 the land was purchased by Turnberry for $45 million, and on October 3, 2000, the old resort was imploded.
The El Rancho sign was covered with a new sign advertising the Turnberry Place condos. Since early 2006, part of the new sign's south side has been missing, and as of April 2006, the words "El Rancho" are visible. The remainder of the site become part of the land used for the Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas.
