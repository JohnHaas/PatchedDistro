Lars Løkke Rasmussen

Lars Løkke Rasmussen (; 15 May 1964) is a Danish politician who served as Prime Minister of Denmark from April 2009 to October 2011. He is the leader of the centre-right liberal party, "Venstre".
Rasmussen has been a member of the Danish parliament (Folketinget) since 21 September 1994. He also served as County Mayor of Frederiksborg County from 1998 to 2001. Subsequently he was the Interior and Health Minister from 27 November 2001 to 23 November 2007 as part of Anders Fogh Rasmussen's first and second Cabinets, and then Minister of Finance from 23 November 2007 to April 2009 as part of Anders Fogh Rasmussen's third Cabinet. On 5 April 2009, he succeeded Anders Fogh Rasmussen as Prime Minister following the latter's appointment as Secretary General of NATO.
In the September 2011 parliamentary election, the government lost its parliamentary majority, and on 16 September 2011, Rasmussen tendered the government's resignation to Queen Margrethe. He remained in office as head of a caretaker government until his successor, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, was appointed on 3 October 2011.
Lars Løkke Rasmussen is not related to his two immediate predecessors as Prime Minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen or Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.
Early life.
Lars Løkke Rasmussen was born in Vejle to Jeppe Rasmussen and Lise Løkke Rasmussen (née Løkke). His last name is Rasmussen, while Løkke, his mother's maiden name, is his middle name. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to only by the name of Rasmussen, but his middle name is used frequently by the media to distinguish him from his two predecessors who shared the same last name.
He graduated from high school in 1983, and was the president of the youth branch of Venstre from 1986 to 1989. He graduated with a law degree (cand. jur) from the University of Copenhagen in 1992. From 1990 to 1995 he worked as a self-employed consultant.
Lars Løkke Rasmussen is married to Sólrun Løkke Rasmussen. Together they have three children.
Political career.
Venstres Ungdom chairmanship and Afghanistan mission.
Lars Løkke Rasmussen served as chairman of the youth branch of Venstre from 1986 to 1989. One of his initiatives was to establish an alternative to "Operation Dagsværk" — an annual one day fundraising campaign by high school students collecting money to third world countries — since "Operation Dagsværk" at the time was spearheaded by members of the Danish Communist Youth. Løkke's campaign was supported by the party youth branch, and raised 600,000 DKK which were spent on school equipment in Soviet occupied Afghanistan. Lars Løkke Rasmussen led a Danish delegation to Afghanistan delivering the collected funds, and a photograph taken by photographer Jørn Stjerneklar shows him and two other delegation members disguised as Afghans. Another photo shows him holding an AK47, while standing together with three Mujahideen. The photos have generated a lot of media attention in Denmark, after the Danish participation in the war in Afghanistan and especially as Rasmussen moved up the rankings at Venstre.
County Mayor and deputy chairman of Venstre.
Rasmussen was elected deputy chairman of Venstre in 1998, at the same time as Anders Fogh Rasmussen assumed the position as party leader after Uffe Ellemann-Jensen. In 1998, he was elected as county mayor of Frederiksborg County, a position he occupied until 2001, when he joined the first Fogh Rasmussen cabinet.
Minister of the Interior and Health.
Lars Løkke Rasmussen served as Interior and Health Minister between 2001 and 2007 until he was appointed Minister of Finance in 2007. He was responsible for negotiating a 2002 agreement between Venstre, the Conservatives, the Social Democrats and the Danish People's Party giving patients in public hospitals the right to select a private hospital, provided that the public hospital had been unable to treat the patient within two months. In 2007, this time limit was lowered to one month. Since 2002, the government has awarded extra funds earmarked at reducing the waiting list at National Health Service hospitals, a grant sometimes referred to by the media as "Løkkeposen" (A pun on 'lykkepose' the Danish word for a goodie bag). He also represented the government during negotiations regarding a reform of the system by which richer municipalities transfer part of their tax incomes to poorer municipalities.
Municipal reform of 2007.
As Minister of the Interior and Health, Lars Løkke Rasmussen spearheaded the municipal reform that reduced Denmark's 271 municipalities to 98, and abolished the 14 counties and replaced them with five regions.
Accusations of financial irregularities.
In the spring of 2008, Lars Løkke Rasmussen was accused by the media of having charged his official accounts with considerable expenses (ca. 800.000 Danish Kroner) he should have paid himself, e.g. restaurants, cigarettes, taxis, and hotels, both as county mayor and as minister. In May 2007, Løkke was accused of having his ministry pay for a hotel room in Copenhagen when he privately attended a Paul McCartney concert in Horsens in 2004.
Minister of Finance.
After then Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen won his second reelection in 2007 he created his third cabinet in which Løkke Rasmussen was appointed Minister of Finance. This was seen as a clear indicator that Løkke was next in line to follow Fogh as leader of Venstre and Prime Minister, when Fogh would leave Danish politics.
As Finance Minister Løkke Rasmussen led the negotiations concerning funds to banks hit by the global financial crisis.
Tax reform of 2009.
In February 2009, Lars Løkke Rasmussen was the chief negotiator in the political agreement behind a major tax reform, implementing the government's ambition of reducing income tax and increasing taxes on pollution. The reform was, according to Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the biggest reduction of the marginal tax rate since the introduction of the income tax in 1903. The opposition accused it of being historically skewed in favouring those with high-income jobs and giving very little to those with low-income jobs.
Prime minister of Denmark.
On 4 April 2009, NATO decided that prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen would replace Jaap de Hoop Scheffer as Secretary General of NATO. On the same day, Anders Fogh Rasmussen declared that he would resign as prime minister on 5 April 2009. As deputy of the largest party in the government, Lars Løkke Rasmussen thus took over the post as prime minister of Denmark. An opinion poll released on the day of Lars Løkke Rasmussen's takeover of the post as prime minister revealed that the Danes believe that he only beats Helle Thorning-Schmidt as the person best suited for bringing Denmark through the financial crisis, and that Thorning-Schmidt would be better suited to combatting unemployment, reducing hospital waiting lists, securing the welfare society of the future, and representing Denmark internationally. On 7 April 2009, Lars Løkke Rasmussen announced the new set of ministers in his Cabinet.
COP15 - December 2009.
Lars Løkke Rasmussen has been sharply criticized from many sides for his handling of the COP15 leadership.
At the first meeting of the summit high level section, led by Lars Løkke Rasmussen, a number of countries protested the Danish handling of the negotiations. ”We cannot continue to talk about procedure, procedure, procedure. We must move forward. The World awaits us”, said Lars Løkke Rasmussen responding to criticism of the Danish led negotiations coming from several countries who regarded them as undemocratic.
Many developing countries viewed this statement as arrogant. Procedure is a major element in UN negotiations. ”This is not about procedure. This is about content. We have stated that the results in Copenhagen must come in two texts. One cannot simply present a text pulled from the clouds”, replied the Chinese delegate in the auditorium.
Stanislaus Lumumba Di-Aping, chief negotiator for the Developing Nations' organisation G77, cross examined what exactly Løkke Rasmussen meant when stating that the chairmen of the negotiating groups should be "people whom we trust". Criticism of the Office of the Prime Minister was supported by China, India and Brazil. The last had been regarded as an ally by the Danish delegation.
The international press, too, has been severe in its criticism of the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's Office. BBC's climate correspondent stated: "According to all my sources, the Prime Minister's Office is on the verge of a melt-down. They have no modus operandi, or the diplomatic experience needed to plan one in advance. Ed Miliband, the former UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change was quoted for stating that "Denmark is doing a reasonable job".
Budget cuts.
In May 2010 Rasmussen's government announced major spending cuts and measures designed to increase revenues, notably to unemployment insurance (cut from a maximum of four years to two), foreign aid (cut from 0.83% of GDP to 0.76%), cuts to child support payments, and miscellaneous tax reforms designed to increase revenues. The cuts were designed to save the government 24 billion DKK.
2011 Election.
Løkke Rasmussen led Venstre in the 2011 parliamentary election. He sought to renew the mandate of the rightwing coalition that has been in power since 2001. Although his party gained a seat, the opposition parties combined obtained more seats than the parties supporting the incumbent government.

HIV/AIDS in Canada

HIV/AIDS was first detected in Canada in 1982. In 2005, there were approximately 58,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 15,000 unaware of their positive status. The total number of infections has increased by about 2,500 per year. Mortality has decreased due to medical advances against HIV/AIDS, especially highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
Population groups.
Women have accounted for 27% of new cases and now make up 20% of all cases.
Aboriginal Canadians.
HIV/AIDS prevalence is increasing most rapidly amongst aboriginal Canadians, with 9% of new infections in 2005. 
A three-country study of HIV diagnoses between 1999 and 2008 showed higher HIV rates from heterosexual contact among aboriginals, especially women, than non-aboriginal people. This suggested a widening epidemic beyond conventional risk groups among aboriginals. The same study showed much higher rates of HIV diagnoses among aboriginal people in Canada than in Australia and New Zealand.
Government policy.
The Canadian government created the Federal Initiative to Address HIV/AIDS in Canada to provide funding for prevention and support programmes to assist vulnerable people as well as research, surveillance, public awareness and evaluation. The Federal Initiative is coordinated through Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Correctional Service Canada.

<doc id="20502327" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20502327" title="Choice architecture">
Choice architecture

Choice architecture describes the way in which decisions may (and can) be influenced by how the choices are presented (in order to influence the outcome), and is a term used by Cass Sunstein and economist Richard Thaler in the 2008 book "Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness". Parallels are drawn between choice architecture and traditional architecture.
'Choice architecture' concept.
Choice architecture seeks to affect outcomes through the manner in which the person or organization presents the choice to the decision-maker. For example, nations that require citizens to opt-out of organ transplant donation have a significantly higher organ-donor rate than nations where the citizens must affirmatively choose to take part (opt-in). Another technique suggested is laying out various outcomes of a decision in a way that is easy for the choice-maker to understand. The literature on choice architecture builds a framework to distinguish between two types of tools that choice architects can use: those that structure a choice in a certain way, and tools that make use of how options are presented to decision-makers. To illustrate, the use of a default, where the default option will lead to a more socially desirable outcome, is an example of structuring choices. The way in which options are categorized and then presented to a decision-maker is an example of presenting options in a way that influences choice.
The concept of choice architecture exists in a number of fields. See for example the work of B. J. Fogg on computers as persuasive technologies; the concept of permission marketing as described by Seth Godin; and as shaping operations in military science. Choice Architecture is also similar to the concept of "heresthetics," or manipulation that changes outcomes without changing people's underlying preferences, described by political scientist William H. Riker. Choice architecture has been implemented in several public and private policy domains. Variants of the Save More Tomorrow Plan (conceived by Richard Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi), which has individuals commit in advance to allocate a portion of future salary increases to savings, have been adopted by companies to increase employee retirement savings.

Adriatic Mills

The Adriatic Mills were a historic industrial complex on Armory Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1854 Eli Thayer (best known for his abolitionist activities) constructed a stone industrial building known as the Lower Junction Shop, which was long and wide. He apparently rented the space to manufacturing interests, before selling it in 1859 to Benjamin F. Joslyn, an arms manufacturer. He manufactured the Joslyn rifle, the first breech-loading rifle, on these premises before selling them in 1863 to the Jordan Marsh Company. Jordan Marsh expanded and repurposed the premises for the production of textiles, and gave the complex the name "Adriatic Mills". It continued to be used for textile production into the 1920s.
The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, at which time it was being used as a foundry by the Chromalloy Corporation. It has since been demolished (c. 2009) to make way for redevelopment.

BESYS

BESYS (Bell Operating System) was an early computing environment originally implemented as a batch processing operating system in 1957 at Bell Labs for the IBM 704 computer. The initial version of the system BESYS2 was created by George Mealy and Gwen Hansen with Wanda Lee Mammel under the guidance of Victor A. Vyssotsky and utilized IBM's FORTRAN and North American's symbolic assembly program (SAP) programming languages. It was designed to efficiently deal with a large number of jobs originating on punched cards and producing results suitable for printing on paper and punched cards. The system also provided processing capabilities for data stored on magnetic tapes and magnetic disk storage units. Typically punched card and print processing was handled off line by peripheral IBM Electronic Accounting Machines, IBM 1401 computers and eventually direct coupled computers.
Internal use.
BESYS was used extensively by many departments of Bell Labs for over a decade. It was made available through the SHARE organization to others without charge or formal technical support.
BESYS versions.
Versions of the BESYS environment (BESYS3, BESYS4, BESYS5, BESYS7 and BE90) were implemented as the underlying computers transitioned through the IBM 709X family and IBM System/360 Models 65 and 67 computers. Throughout this period the head of the BESYS development project was George L. Baldwin. In the 1960s, when Bell Labs sought to transition to a more advanced time sharing environment, principles and experience from this project loosely influenced the development of Multics.

RAF Bolt Head was a Royal Air Force grass airfield 1 mile south west of Salcombe on the south Devon coast, England from 1941 to 1945. During the Second World War it was used as a satellite for RAF Exeter. There were two runways, of 3,680 ft at 45° and 4,200 ft at 120°
The Ground Control Interceptor Station, (GCI) RAF Hope Cove. was established nearby in 1941 to direct fighter operations in the English Channel.
Today the WW2 buildings are almost all gone but a memorial to the airfield's war-time history exists in the centre of the site, two notable post-war buildings survive including a large R6 Rotor bunker (used until 1994 as a Regional Government HQ) and a grass airstrip is still used by occasionally by light aircraft. The landowners also hosted an air display there in 2009 which saw a Hurricane and Spitfire visit the airfield for the first time since the war.

Milton, Newfoundland and Labrador

Milton is a small former logging community on Smith Sound, Trinity Bay, on the island of Newfoundland in the Canadian Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Situated on the shores of the inner reaches of Smith Sound the community is on Route 230-A, which starts at Clarenville and continues to the intersection at Route 230. Nesled in the lee of the Greeps Nest Hill, the winters are mild and spring to fall are pleasantly warm and attributes its climate to the protection of its environment from the sheltering effects of Random Island from the open Atlantic.
The community was originally settled in 1868 after two previous "wintering-over" by Wm. James Adams and his four sons and three of his four daughters. They came to the area from Old Perlican on the east side of Trinity Bay. Originally named King's Cove, it changed its name to Milton (it is believed after the poet John Milton) in the 1920s.
It has always been a logging town and at its height in the 30's possessed four water-powered and 8 gas-powered saw mills. The only remnants of its logging history is found in the name of the small brook that runs through the town called THE SAW PIT BROOK". At another point in its history it was also a siding for the branch railway line to Bonivista. This element was run by Mr. Herbert Adams. 
The family was originally settled by this Adams clan (who descended from the Scottish Highlands) and descendants of these four brothers are still scattered throughout the community to this day. The community has seen 6 generations of the family make its home here.
Other industries that have existed here were a Brick Manufacturing plant (the only one in NL until its closure in the 70's) as well as the coming ashore site for a fibre-optic cable that originated in Greenland. It was also the starting point of the cross country explored Wm Epps Cormack and his traveling companion Joseph Sylvester where they began their trek across the provinces interior in 1832.
Today the community functions as a bedroom community to the Clarenville area.

The Aldus Chapin Higgins House is a historic house at 1 John Wing Road, on the campus of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), in Worcester, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story house was designed by Grosvenor Atterbury, although Aldus Chapin Higgins, the owner, had likely made sketches and other design notes for some years before hiring Atterbury. The house, whose exterior is faced in stucco, brick, and stone, is in the Tudor Revival style, and contains antique building materials imported from Europe. Among these are some of its leaded glass windows, and a fireplace mantel that came from an Italian monastery. Aldus Higgins was the son of Milton Prince Higgins, a local industrialist, and a graduate of WPI.

Quebec prohibition referendum, 1919

The Quebec referendum on the prohibition of alcohol, held on April 10, 1919, considered the legalization of the sale of beer, cider and wine in the province of Quebec, Canada. The 'yes' side won with 78.62% of the votes.
The question asked.
The question asked in English on the ballot paper was: "Should sale of light beer, cider and wines be allowed?"
In French, the question was: "Êtes-vous d'opinion que la vente des bières, cidres et vins légers, tels que définis par la loi, devrait être permise?"
The results of the vote.
178,112 persons (78.62%) voted in favour of the proposal, while 48,433 (21.38%) voted against; proposal was therefore passed with a majority of 129,679 votes. The analysis of the vote by riding reveals that all voted in favour except for seven: Pontiac, Compton, Dorchester, Huntingdon, Brome, Stanstead and Richmond.
The result of the vote was that the subsequent prohibition law which became effective on May 1, 1919 only applied to spirits. The victory of the "moderate" prohibitionists over the "radicals" did not have immediate repercussion on the legal sale of alcohol for in 1919, 90% of Quebec municipalities were prohibiting its sale locally. Indeed, Trois-Rivières, Lévis, Lachine, Sainte-Agathe, Louiseville, Sainte-Rose and Terrebonne had voted for local prohibition in 1915, while Quebec City had done the same on October 4, 1917. All these regulations had to be rescinded, one municipality at a time.
Prohibition was finally abolished on May 1, 1921 when the "Alcoholic Beverages Act" creating the Commission des liqueurs du Québec entered into force.

<doc id="20502547" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20502547" title="Of Reformation">
Of Reformation

Of Reformation is a 1641 pamphlet by John Milton, and his debut in the public arena. Its full title is "Of Reformation of Church-Discipline in England".
Background.
This work was followed by four others, also related to church hierarchy and Presbyterianism. Christopher Hill considers that Milton was somewhat influenced, in the series, by the style of the pamphleteer Martin Marprelate, back in print; and notes that the timing in May 1641 was in the same month as the execution of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, and the fall of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. Further, Hill points out Milton's "special interest in the cultural and moral consequences, as he saw them, of episcopacy."
The work was Milton's first independently produced work, and was published in May 1641 under the title "Of Reformation Touching Church-Discipline in England: And the Cavses that hitherto have hindered it". The first page offers an alternate title, "Of Reformation in England".
Tract.
In "Of Reformation", Milton relies on the concept of a body to serve as a metaphor for his analysis of religion. He believes that the Reformation would allow for a structuring of the body to something more perfect, and that the Gospel was:
refin'd to such a Spirituall height, and temper of purity, and knowledge of the Creator, that the body, with all the circumstances of time and place, were purif'd by the affections of the regenerat Soule, and nothing left impure, but sinne;
"Faith" needing not the weak, and fallible office of the Senses, to be either the Ushers, or Interpreters, of heavenly Mysteries, save where our Lord himselfe in his Sacraments ordain'd.
The purity, metaphorically speaking, removed any physical aspects and allowed for a direct relationship between soul and spiritual truth. Any interference between the two, especially in the form of a mediating force such as a church government or a liturgy, would hinder this connection. When individuals push for a religious structure, they try to make the individual metaphorically physical so:
that they might bring the inward acts of the "Spirit" to the outward, and customary ey-Service of the body, as if they could make "God" earthly, and fleshly, because they could not make themselves "heavenly", and "Spirituall": they began to draw downe all the Divine intercours, betwixt "God", and the Soule, yea, the very shape of "God" himselfe, into an exterior, and bodily forme.
Although God does have a shape, he is without a physical body and his existence is above human perception. Any attempt to force him into a bodily form, or emphasising bodily forms is a corruption and a failure of the individual, and the Reformation's primary purpose was to restore our ideas to their proper place, i.e. to remove these physical conceptions. Furthermore, truth comes to the individual through scripture, not through liturgy, and, as Milton argues: "The very essence of Truth is plainnesse, and brightnes; the darknes and crookednesse is our own. The "Wisdome" of "God" created "understanding", fit and proportionable to Truth the object, and end of it, as the eye to the thing visible ."
He also attacks many of the Church fathers, accusing them of "the ridiculous wresting of Scripture". He also attacks that the Anglican/Episcopal tradition was supported by "canary-sucking and swan-eating" individuals.
Milton's argument did not just discuss church government but discussed the concept of government as a whole. In an argument that was based partly on the writings of Polybius and Thomas Smith's "The Commonwealth of England", Milton declares the importance of republicanism:
the best founded Commonwealths, and least barbarous have aym'd at a certain mixture and temperament, partaking the severall vertues of each other State, that each part drawing to it selfe may keep up a steddy and eev'n uprightnesse in common.
There is no Civill "Government" that hath beene known, no not the "Spartan", not the "Roman", though both for this respect so much prais'd by the wise "Polybius", more divinely and harmoniously tun'd, more equally ballanc'd as it were by the hand and scale of Justice, then is the Commonwealth of "England": where under a free, and untutor'd "Monarch", the noblest, worthiest, and most prudent men, with full approbation, and suffrage of the People have in their power the supreame, and finall determination of highest Affaires.
In Book II, Milton discusses "Tale of the Wen", which describes the relationship of the Body with its other aspects. The Went tries to emphasise its own importance over the other parts of the body until a Philosopher is brought to discuss the Went. The Wen, according to the Philosopher, is a parasite that will be revealed as a parasite "when I have cut thee off". However, the Philosopher, in the story, never removes the Wen and it continues to be present through the rest of the Book. Milton uses the images to emphasise the need for healing, and argues that the church government, especially the bishops, are the same kind of parasite that interferes with the body. Milton extends the metaphor towards the idea of commonwealth as a whole: 
And because things simply pure are inconsistent in the masse of nature, nor are the elements or humor in Mans Body exactly "homogeneal", and hence the best founded Commonwealths, and least barbarous have aym'd at a certain mixture and temperament, partaking the several virtues of each other
Themes.
Milton opposed the concept of the establishment of a central Church government. He believed that individual congregations should govern themselves. His view of how bishops would burn in hell is connected to themes originating in is poem "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity". According to C. A. Patrides, it "combines a serene assurance that an appeal to reason would prove decisive, with an apocalyptic persuasion that the Primal Reason could hardly fail to intervene on behalf of so just a cause as Milton's."
Parts of "Of Reformation" emphasise a conflict present within Milton: he believed that the act of writing the work would take away from the spiritual connection between an individual and God. The physicality of writing interferes with the soul, and that any appeal would be to the physical senses and possibly not to the spiritual. In essence, the church is corrupted whore who "out of question from her pervers conceiting of "God", and holy things, she has faln to beleeve no "God at all".

Secrets (The Dooleys album)

Secrets is a 1981 album by British pop group The Dooleys. Released on GTO Records, it was their final album in the UK.
Background.
By late 1981, the group had released two consecutive flop singles, "In a Riddle" from the previous album and "Taken at the Flood", a stand-alone single, which wasn't considered good enough for inclusion on this album. The group spent the year recording this album with new producer, former pop singer Barry Blue. In September, the lead single "And I Wish" was released. An upbeat pop song, it became their first chart entry for a year, but only managed to reach No.52. The album was released soon after. Their record label, GTO Records was at the time being taken over by Epic Records and promotion for the album suffered. "Secrets" failed to chart, as did the follow-up single "The Dancer", which was released by Epic. In Japan, a third single was released; "Tokyo Feeling". Track "Tip of My Tongue" (co-written by Lynsey De Paul) had previously been recorded by Barry Blue himself and also as a single by Liquid Gold's Ellie Hope, while track "Love Me, Love Me Do" had been recorded (but never released) a year earlier by pop duo Dollar as "Living Each Day for You".
Soon after the album's release three members of the group departed to live in South Africa and a new female singer was employed, making the group now a six-piece. Some new tracks were recorded and released along with several songs from this album in Germany in 1982, where "And I Wish" had been a hit. The album was titled "And I Wish" there, while it was renamed "The Dancer" in Japan, where they had experienced some success over the past two years. 
The group released two more singles in the UK and did record another album in 1983, but this was only released in Japan. Single, "And I Wish" remains The Dooleys final UK chart entry.
"Secrets" was released on compact disc by Cherry Red Records in May 2013 in a double-pack with their previous album, "Full House". This featured a number of bonus tracks, including two non-album singles released around this time.

According to Worcester city records, a diner was operating on the site since at least the late 1930s, although they did not bear the "Miss Worcester" name. In 1948 the Worcester Lunch Car Company manufactured diner #812 for Dino Soteropoulos, delivering it on June 14. However, he is listed as operating the "Star Diner" in 1949, only taking the name "Miss Worcester" in 1950. He and family partners ran the business until 1963, after which it has had a succession of owners.
The diner sits on a small portion of a larger parcel, most of which is occupied by a c. 1870 brick textile mill building. Directly across Quinsigamond Avenue is the factory in which the diner was built. The diner body is seven bays wide and three deep, and is attached to a concrete block kitchen addition that was built c. 1948. The diner has the classic barrel-shaped roof, with canopies extending over the entrances, which are on the short ends of the structure. The walls are paneled in enamel that is yellow with light blue trim.
Inside the diner, there is a marble counter extending most of the length of the diner, excepting staff access points at the ends. Customers sit at fourteen metal stools with red details. There are five booths lining the south (front) wall, but these are plywood laminate replacements. In contrast to the lighter colors on the exterior, the interior color scheme is darker, with wood tones and dark red coloring accented by cream and steel.
The diner was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Mission Chapel

The Mission Chapel is a historic church at 205 Summer Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. A rare example of the early Victorian Norman (or "Romanesque in panel") styling, it was built by Ichabod Washburn in 1854, and is one of the city's oldest church buildings. The exterior side walls are divided into bays separated by piers which rise to a layer of corbelling, with a second layer of corbelling just below the eave. The main facade is divided into three bays, with arched windows in the gable. The Evangelical City Missionary Society, for whom the chapel was built, was established by a group of local Protestant congregations as a missionary site for serving the city's poor and needy. The building was rented out for commercial purposes during the mid-20th century, but has otherwise been used for religious and missionary purposes.
The chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Green Bank Interferometer

The Green Bank Interferometer (GBI) is a former radio astronomy telescope located at Green Bank, West Virginia (USA) and operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). It included three radio telescopes of 85-foot (26m) diameter, designated 85-1, 85-3, and 85-2 (85-1 is also known as the Tatel Telescope).
The GBI began operation in 1964 as a two element interferometer in order to test large aperture synthesis arrays and study radio astrometry and interstellar scintillation. In 1967 the array was upgraded with construction of the third element. From 1978-1996, it was operated in support of USNO and NRL geodetic and astronomy programs, but then briefly suspended operations. 
The Green Bank Interferometer (GBI) resumed operation as a radio monitoring instrument on Nov. 22, 1996, operated by NRAO and supported by the NASA High Energy Astrophysics program. The GBI was then used as a two telescope interferometer that operated simultaneously at 2.7 and 8.3 GHz to monitor transient, galactic X-ray binaries, AGN's and Gamma-ray sources. Amongst the prime sources were GRS 1915+105, GRO J1655-40, Cyg X-3, Cyg X-1, GRS 1716-249, SS433, and LS I +61 303. 
On the October 6, 2000 the GBI monitoring program has ceased due to lack of funding.

Chadwick Square Diner

The Chadwick Square Diner or Worcester Lunch Car Company Diner #660 or Ralph's Chadwick Square Diner is a historic diner at 95 Prescott Street (rear) in Worcester, Massachusetts. Although the building faces Grove Street, it is attached to one of the 19th century Washburn and Moen Works buildings which fronts on Prescott Street. The diner is a rare early version of a streetcar-inspired design, and may be the only one of its type in the state. It is long and deep, with twelve window bays. It has a monitor-style roof with clerestory windows, and entrances at the ends under roof overhangs. The northern entrance now serves as an emergency exit, while the south entrance now serves as the main entrance to the nightclub in the attached building. The interior is exceptionally well-preserved, retaining many of its original finishes.
The diner was built by Worcester Lunch Car Company in 1930 for Robert and Mamie Gilhooly of Worcester, who operated it at 414 Grove Street. The neon "G" on the front of the diner stands for Gilhooly. It was first located in the Chadwick Square section of Worcester and was a popular place.
Robert Gilhooly died in 1955, after which the diner was purchased by his cousin Mary Ryan Clingen and her husband James Clingen of Cherry Valley. It was then moved near to the Worcester-Leicester line, and was operated at 1546 Main Street by their son-in-law and daughter, Ralph and Eileen Dryden.
The diner was later sold to Ralph Moberly and moved to its present location in 1979. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Italian electoral law referendum, 2009

Three referendums on reforming the electoral law were held in Italy on 21-22 June 2009. They were promoted by Mario Segni, Giovanni Guzzetta, Arturo Parisi, Antonio Martino and Daniele Capezzone. With a turnout of 23.31% / 23.84%, the referendums did not reach the necessary quorum of 50% voters, so were not valid.
The three questions were about giving the majority prize to the most voted list in the Chamber of Deputies (question 1, purple ballot) and in the Senate (question 2, yellow ballot) as opposed to the most voted coalition, as is the current law, and about preventing politicians from standing in multiple constituencies at the same time (question 3, green ballot).
The Promoting Committee and Democratic Party (PD) had proposed holding the referendums together with European Parliament elections, whereas The People of Freedom (PdL) as its main ally, the Lega Nord, opposed the referendums and answered that never, in Italian history, an election and a referendum were jointly celebrated.
Several PdL party officials had long supported the referendums, the main long-term goal of the PdL being to transform Italian politics into a two-party system. The PD saw the referendums as an opportunity to overcome its current political hard times and to divide the centre-right.
Results.
The referendums did not reach the quorum required by law for their validity.
First question.
Italian Chamber of Deputies — Abrogation of the connection between lists and of the attribution of the majority prize to a coalition of lists.
Second question.
Italian Senate — Abrogation of the connection between lists and of the attribution of the majority prize to a coalition of lists.
Third question.
Italian Chamber of Deputies — Abrogation of the possibility for a candidate to stand for election in more than one constituency.

Otiorhynchus

Otiorhynchus (often spelt "Otiorrhynchus") is a large genus of weevils in the family Curculionidae. Many species of the genus, particularly the black vine weevil ("O. sulcatus") and the strawberry root weevil ("O. ovatus"), are important pests, both as larvae and as adults. Larvae feed on plant roots. Adults are flightless with fused elytra and feed at night on plant foliage. In many species of the genus at least some races are polyploid and parthenogenetic, while the rest of the races and species are diploid and bisexual. "Otiorhynchus" weevils, particularly "O. scaber", have been a popular subject for studies of the evolution of parthenogenesis. The genus is native to the Palearctic region. However, sixteen species were inadvertently introduced to North America and have become widespread there.
A number of species are troglobites, cave-dwelling animals that lack eyes.
There are over 1,500 species in this genus, which is divided into at least 105 subgenera.

It was developed as a completely new street in 1885 replacing Shoe Lane (part of which was called Stocking Lane) and George's Street. The street was named after Tara, the home of the ancient high kings of Ireland.
In April 1907 Dublin Fire Brigade opened its headquarters at the new fire station at the corner of Tara Street and Pearse Street. This would be the headquarters of the Fire Brigade until a new headquarters was opened in Townsend Street in 1998. The brick watch tower at the intersection of the two streets is now a protected structure.
During the Easter Rising, British artillery shelled Liberty Hall from Tara Street, though the road surface made it difficult.
Tara Street was widened in 1932 after Butt Bridge was changed from a swing bridge to a three span fixed structure.
In October 2006, the Irish Times moved to new headquarters in Tara Street. Previously, it had been based on D'Olier Street
Literary connection.
Leopold Bloom used the Tara Street public baths in the Lotus Eaters section of the novel Ulysses.

Tom Barabas

Tom Barabas is an American-Hungarian pianist/keyboardist. He studied classical music at the Caracas Conservatory in Venezuela before developing a taste for rock, jazz, and New Age.
Childhood.
Barabas spent his childhood in Hungary, and emigrated to the US in the 1960s, living and composing in San Diego, California. In the classic style of great, onstage performers, Tom Barabas delivers a musically eloquent experience that builds rapport with his audience and invites them to fall in love with his graceful streams of sound.
An Early Start - Tom began playing music at the age of four in Budapest, Hungary. By age 12, he had attracted the interest and praise of his piano instructors and he made his public debut at the Liszt Conservatory of Music. In 1949 his family emigrated to Venezuela where he studied classical piano and composition at the Venezuela Conservatory of Music in Caracas, Venezuela’s “Juilliard”. He earned his Master’s Degree in 1957.
Live Performance.
The Live Experience - The classical training of the conservatory, the vibrant Latin and Caribbean pop music of Venezuela, and the raw energy of North American rock-n-roll all have contributed to the fresh compositional style that has come to be Tom’s signature.
Barabas has had a lifelong love-affair with live performance. After a successful career performing daily on stage, radio and television in Venezuela, Tom moved to San Diego in 1966 seeking greater opportunities. The Southern California music scene inspired and cultivated his interest in jazz and soon he was opening for such jazz greats as Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans and Ramsey Lewis. He later became the house pianist for a five-star resort and it was during his tenure there that his creativity and innovation flourished and he began playing his own compositions.
A seasoned professional dedicated to originality, Tom’s career has been built on his unique blend of personal composition and trademark style. His sensitive and passionate relationship to his music is a true dance of the heart.
Critical and Commercial Success.
Tom Barabas has a nationwide following. He’s released 12 CD’s, three of which have made the Billboard Charts. Sedona Suite, perhaps his best loved album, charted #12 and held that position for 29 weeks! Other albums of note include Wind Dancer (with Dean Evenson), reaching Billboard’s Top-15, and Classica Nouveau, which reached #18 on Billboard’s Top-20. He has also released Journey Back to Sedona, Mosaic, Piano Impressions, Magic in December, Soaring and Back To The Garden (both with Dean Evenson), It’s a New Life, Romantic Rhapsodies and Tom Barabas Live.
Tom and Dean Evenson have enjoyed a long friendship and musical collaboration on several Soundings albums including Soaring, WindDancer, Back to the Garden and Healing Suite.
“With just a solo grand piano, Tom Barabas has created an absolutely glorious album that highlights his virtuosity as a performer and allows his unique artistry as a composer to shine through.” — Ted Cox, TOWER RECORDS, NAR Reviewer.
Tom has enjoyed the spotlight across the country. He is sought by corporations, cruise lines, production companies, concert and program planners, hotels, spas and resorts to bring a level of quality and beauty to any event. He wrote and performed an original composition for the Heartkeys AIDS Benefit Concert and the Heartkeys album and has performed for the American Cancer Society and the AIDS Foundation of America. Some of his better known performance venues have been with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Red Rocks Amphitheater, Delta Airlines and Princess Cruise Lines.
Reviews.
“Tom’s performance was sensational. The artistry of his music and his personal charm enriched the evening for everyone. We thank him for sharing his exceptional talents with us.” — Nancy Mulligan, ASPEN Productions, Inc.
National reviewer, P.J. Birosik’s response to Tom’s music echoes the sentiments of his fans across the country – ”Barabas composes richly harmonic and well-articulated pieces that satisfy the soul and stir the imagination.” He performs with an intimacy, spontaneity and living warmth that sets him apart from other instrumentalists. His technique combines classical, Latin and jazz traditions in an unmistakably personal and joyful style.

Southbridge-Sargent Manufacturing District

The Southbridge-Sargent Manufacturing District encompasses a collection of three 19th-century factory buildings near a historically important railroad junction in southern Worcester, Massachusetts. They were built near the intersection of Sargent and Gold Streets, just south of Southbridge Street. The location is close to a junction of three major railroads: the Boston and Albany, the Norwich and Worcester, and the New York, New Haven, and Hartford. The area was once a major industrial part of the city, but has lost many of its historic factory buildings in the 20th century.
The most significant building in the district is the former Sargent Card-Clothing Factory, 300 Southbridge Street. This Second Empire three story brick structure, built in 1866, is one of the oldest surviving factory buildings in the city. It was built for the Sargent brothers, leading manufacturers of card making machinery, and is built to a plan that was used, with some modifications, for later purpose-built factory buildings in the city.
The Rice and Griffin Factory at 5 Sargent Street was built c. 1890. It was originally three stories with a pitched gable roof, but the roof was removed and a fourth floor added. Rice and Griffin was founded in 1866, and was listed at that address from 1872 until 1905. The company's principal business was the production of architectural building parts, and it is probable that their products decorated a significant number of Worcester's Victorian houses.
The third factory, at 125 Gold Street, was built c. 1892 for the Whitcomb Manufacturing Company. It is a utilitarian two story brick building. The company began operations in space rented at 5 Sargent Street before building these premises. The company produced metalworking machinery, including planers, shearing and punching tools.
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

<doc id="20503064" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20503064" title="Corticiales">
Corticiales

The Corticiales are an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes. The order is mostly composed of corticioid fungi, but also includes one anomalous agaricoid species, "Marchandiomphalina foliacea". Species within the order are generally saprotrophic, most of them wood-rotters, but several are parasitic on grasses or lichens. Those of economic importance include "Waitea circinata", a pathogen of cereal crops, and "Laetisaria fuciformis", the cause of red thread disease in turf grass.
Taxonomy.
The order was established in 2007 by Swedish mycologist Karl-Henrik Larsson, based on molecular phylogenetic research. Though the precise boundaries of the order and its constituent families are yet to be resolved, it includes the Corticiaceae (the type family) as well as the Punctulariaceae and Vuilleminiaceae.
Habitat and distribution.
The order is cosmopolitan and contains around 150 species of fungi worldwide. The majority of species in the Corticiales are saprotrophs, most of them wood-rotters, typically found on dead attached branches. Species of "Laetisaria", "Limonomyces", and "Waitea" are facultative or obligate parasites of grasses; species of "Marchandiobasidium" and "Marchandiomyces" are parasites of lichens; "Marchandiomphalina foliacea" is itself lichenized.
Economic importance.
"Waitea circinata" is an important pathogen of commercial cereal crops, causing a number of diseases including sheath spot of rice. The same fungus also causes brown ring patch in turf grasses. "Laetisaria fuciformis" is the cause of red thread disease in turf grass.

<doc id="20503067" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20503067" title="Auriculariales">
Auriculariales

The Auriculariales are an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes. Species within the order were formerly referred to the "heterobasidiomycetes" or "jelly fungi", since many have gelatinous basidiocarps (fruit bodies) that produce spores on septate basidia. Around 200 species are known worldwide, placed in six or more families, though the status of these families is currently uncertain. All species in the Auriculariales are believed to be saprotrophic, most growing on dead wood. Fruit bodies of several "Auricularia" species are cultivated for food on a commercial scale, especially in China.
Taxonomy.
History.
The order was established in 1889 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter to accommodate species of fungi having "auricularioid" basidia (more or less cylindrical basidia with lateral septa), including many of the rusts and smuts. In 1922, British mycologist Carleton Rea recognized the order as containing the families Auriculariaceae and Ecchynaceae, as well as the rusts (Coleosporiaceae and Pucciniaceae) and the smuts (Ustilaginaceae). Many subsequent authors, however, separated out the rusts and smuts and amalgamated the remaining Auriculariales with the Tremellales. Jülich (1981) also separated out the rusts and smuts, but recognized the remaining Auriculariales as an independent order, placing within them the families Auriculariaceae, Cystobasidiaceae, Paraphelariaceae, Saccoblastiaceae, Ecchynaceae, Hoehnelomycetaceae, and Patouillardinaceae.
A radical revision was undertaken in 1984, when American mycologist Robert Bandoni used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the ultrastructure of the septal pore apparatus in the Auriculariales. This revealed that species of fungi with "auricularioid" basidia were not necessarily closely related and that "Auricularia" had more in common with "Exidia" and its allies (with "tremelloid" basidia), than with other auricularioid fungi. Bandoni therefore amended the Auriculariales to include the family Auriculariaceae (with auricularioid basidia) together with the families Exidiaceae, Aporpiaceae, Hyaloriaceae, and Sebacinaceae (with tremelloid basidia). This revision was accepted by Wells (1994) who, however, amalgamated the Aporpiaceae and Hyaloriaceae and added the families Patouillardinaceae (with diagonally septate basidia) and Tremellodendropsidaceae (with partly septate basidia). Roberts (1998) subsequently added the family Oliveoniaceae (with non-septate basidia).
Current status.
Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has substantially supported Bandoni's revised circumscription of the Auriculariales, but has moved the Sebacinaceae to their own separate order, the Sebacinales. The status of the constituent families has not yet been examined, but a clade containing "Auricularia" and "Exidia" species equates to the Auriculariaceae, whilst another containing "Hyaloria" and "Myxarium" species equates to the Hyaloriaceae.
Description.
The majority of species within the Auriculariales produce gelatinous basidiocarps (fruit bodies) on dead wood. In some these are conspicuous and may be ear-shaped, button-shaped, lobed, or effused. Their hymenophores (spore-bearing surfaces) may be smooth, warted, veined, toothed (as in the genus "Pseudohydnum"), or poroid (as in the genera "Elmerina" and "Protomerulius"). Some species, however, produce dry, leathery, or web-like fruit bodies resembling those of the corticioid fungi. A few species in the genus "Tremellodendropsis" produce clavarioid (club or coral-like) fruit bodies.
Distribution and habitat.
All species within the Auriculariales are thought to be saprotrophs, most of them wood-rotters. They are typically found on dead attached or fallen wood, though a few ("Guepinia" and "Tremellodendropsis" species) are normally found on the ground. As a group, their distribution is cosmopolitan. According to a 2008 estimate, the Auriculariales contain 32 genera and around 200 species.
Economic importance.
Several species within the order are edible and two, "Auricularia auricula-judae" and "A. cornea", are cultivated on a commercial scale, particularly in China and southeast Asia. They are widely exported, in a dried or powdered state, as "black fungus", "cloud ears", or "wood ears".

Ruth weiss

Ruth Weiss or better known as ruth weiss (born 1928) is a German-born poet, performer, playwright and artist who made her home and career in the United States, as a member of the Beat Generation, a label she has recently embraced and that is used frequently by historians detailing her life and works. 
weiss spells her name in lowercase as such as a symbolic protest against "law and order," since in her birthplace of Germany all nouns are spelled capitalized.
Biography.
Early life.
ruth weiss came from a climate of political turmoil. Born to a Jewish family in the tumultuous years of the rise of Nazism, her early childhood was spent fleeing her home with her parents. Their bid for survival took them from their home of Berlin to Vienna and eventually to the Netherlands, whereby weiss and her family left for the United States. In 1939, she and her family arrived in New York City and from there moved on to Chicago. weiss excelled academically at school in Chicago, graduating in the top 1% of her class. However, in 1946 she and her parents moved back to Germany, this time not as German citizens but as American citizens, as her parents worked for the Army of Occupation. weiss went on to school in Switzerland and spent much time hitchhiking and writing - two skills that would prove pivotal to her future in the American Bohemian Beat scene. In 1948, weiss and her parents moved back to the United States, resettling in Chicago.
Early Career 1940s - 1950s.
weiss left home in 1949, at first staying in Chicago. She originally moved into the Art Circle - a housing community for artists. It was in this community that she began experimenting with poetry and jazz. In 1952, she left Chicago and hitchhiked to San Francisco, where she began jamming and reading poetry with street musicians. Shortly after, several of her friends opened a club called The Cellar, in which she would regularly hold poetry and jazz sessions every Wednesday night. Eventually, weiss felt that she needed a break from city life and took off for California's Big Sur, a place made famous as a Beat center due to Jack Kerouac's novel of the same name. In "Breaking the Rule of Cool: Interviewing and Reading Women Beat Writers," weiss details the events at The Cellar following her leave. In regards to the poetry-jazz sessions, she tells her interviewer, "...other well-known poets, whose names I'm not going to mention because everyone knows them, ended up doing the same thing. Only they were very smart. They recorded them and got records out of them. So nobody knows that I did this, innovate jazz and poetry in San Francisco in 1956 at The Cellar." During this period in her life, she also began publishing proliferously in the magazine "Beatitude," one of the first magazines for Beat writers. 
ruth weiss and Jack Kerouac first met in 1952. They had, in her words, a "fantastic connection on multiple levels." It was two years after Kerouac had published his first novel, "The Town and the City," though weiss did not yet know that he had written and published a book. Instead, weiss and Kerouac engaged upon a "haiku dialogue," spending hours over a bottle of wine writing haiku back and forth to one another. Occasionally Neal Cassady would show up and the three of them would drive off, adventuring outwards in California at dangerous speeds up dangerous hills, thriving on the excitement of the ride and one another's presence. 
In 1957, weiss started a "salon kind of situation" in her apartment, creating a gathering space for poets and writers to read and discuss their works. It was also in that year that she married her first husband, Mel Weitsman, a man who later became a Zen priest. Two years later in 1959, weiss published her book "GALLERY OF WOMEN," a book composed in poetry, honoring the female poets who she most admired, paying homage to them by painting their portraits through her jazz-inspired poetry.
Later Career 1960s - 1970s.
In 1960, weiss finished her narrative poem "THE BRINK." Upon reviewing her poem, the painter Paul Beattie asked if weiss could turn it into a film script, a request which she willingly obliged. By 1961, weiss had finished her creation and filming of "THE BRINK," incorporating "found objects" into her style and philosophy towards the film. 
However, "DESERT JOURNAL" is the work that weiss herself describes as her masterpiece and her most significant work to-date. The piece is an exploration of a mind in a desert. The poem's subject spends 40 days and nights in a desert and each day of the desert is limited to a poem of five pages, each day being its own poem within the greater whole. Everyday, the gender-warping subject of the poem has a new area of exploration and revelation, and the poem brings the reader through the highs and lows, the turmoil and the peace, that the disembodied protagonist transverses. weiss began writing this poem in 1961 and spent seven years on it, not completing it until 1968. Finally in 1977, weiss had the poem published. weiss describes that this poem, like the bulk of her work, is a performance piece, a piece whose meaning she can fully express only through enacting it.
weiss asserts that the period of the 60s is when she began spelling her name solely in lower case.
ruth weiss now: 1980s onwards.
ruth weiss has published many poems and anthologies in recent years, including "Full Circle," a reflection on her escape from Nazi Germany. She continues to perform live in North Beach and at many jazz and poetry festivals. Her work also had a three month exhibition at the San Francisco Main Public Library.
In 1990, weiss won the Bay Area poetry slam and consequently released recordings of her poetry performance, entitled "Poetry & Allthatjazz." 
In 1996, weiss' film "THE BRINK" was screened at the Whitney Museum.
Influences.
weiss credits Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf, the French New Wave and Djuna Barnes, among many others, as her largest influences. 
However, as she primarily considers herself a "jazz poet," she has also credited jazz and bebop as the art most influential upon her own. In "Breaking the Rules of Cool," weiss recounts a night in 1949 while she was living in the Art Circle of Chicago. On this night, there was a crowd of people in her building having a jazz jam session downstairs while weiss was preoccupied writing in her room. However, a friend of hers paid a visit, read her work and recommended that she bring it downstairs and read it to the musicians. The musicians, far from halting their music to listen, listened by continuing to jam as she read, and likewise, weiss listened to and communicated with their jazz by incorporating it into her poem. It is that experience that she credits as the beginning of her "whole thing with jazz and poetry." 
Style.
weiss's philosophy behind her work incorporates several interlinking components: being a "street poet," being a "jazz poet," the idea of non-linearity and fragmentation, the idea of discipline and the bare "bones" of language. 
Her focus upon succinctness and discipline is epitomized in her focus on haikus. She relishes the haiku for the discipline it imposes upon the writer and the way it forces the "fat" to be cut away from the poem, revealing the most essential elements of language. 
Similarly, this focus upon "cutting out the fat" lies at the heart of her artistic journey with "DESERT JOURNAL." One person who reviewed "DESERT JOURNAL" described weiss as "master of the eraser." It is this ability to "erase" that characterizes weiss's work and that she herself finds most pivotal to her style. weiss describes it as epitomizing the process that she goes through with all her work: the idea of non-linearity, of beginning with a core and allowing the essential fragments that develop to become the substance of the piece. 
weiss also cites being inspired by the "oral tradition." She explains this in light of her close friendship and artistic connection with the famed poet Madeline Gleason. Her poetry, she says, is a performance, it is something communicated by the voice and body.
Finally, weiss declares that while she's not a "street poet" in the traditional sense, her work resonates most in "street" settings or other unexpected places. She's found that her work is often most acclaimed, connected with and called for in places ranging from streets to pizza places to gay bars, drawing a large, diverse crowd.

AD Fafe

Associação Desportiva de Fafe "(abbreviated as AD Fafe)" is a Portuguese football club based in Fafe in the district of Braga in northern Portugal.
Background.
AD Fafe currently plays in the Segunda Divisão Série Norte which is the third tier of Portuguese football. The club was founded in 1958 and they play their home matches at the Parque Municipal dos Desportos in Fafe which was constructed in 1968. The stadium is able to accommodate 8,000 spectators.
Improved facilities off the pitch were matched by better performances on the pitch and the club successively moved up divisions. Just as the club was celebrating its 30th anniversary, it achieved a first ever first division promotion after finishing runner-up in the second division, in 1987–88. 
In the subsequent top flight campaign, Fafe finished 16th and was immediately relegated, but did manage a shock 0–0 draw at F.C. Porto. In 1990–91's second division, the club managed to sign 18-year old Rui Costa (on loan from S.L. Benfica), who managed 38 games with 6 goals before "returning home".
The next few years were tough because Fafe dropped down two divisions in a couple of years, managing promotion from the fourth level to the third in 1996, where they remained for over a decade. In 2007–08, under manager Carlos Condeço the club finished 11th.
The club is affiliated to Associação de Futebol de Braga and has entered the national cup competition known as Taça de Portugal on many occasions, reaching the semifinals twice, in 1977 and 1979.

Community Human Services Corporation

The Community Human Services Corporation (CHSC) is a human service agency based in the South Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Its administrative offices are located at 374 Lawn Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. The mission of CHSC is: 
"to enhance people’s lives and strengthen communities by providing opportunities to develop individual potential and by delivering comprehensive services that maximize the health and well-being of those it serves in South Oakland and the greater Pittsburgh area."
The agency has a focus on a variety of issues including mental health, health, housing and community supports.
History.
The history of Community Human Services Corporation dates back to the early 1970s. At that time, the South Oakland community was experiencing the same manner of change and decline as other inner city communities. The deaths of longtime residents and subsequent sale of their homes, coupled with an exodus to the suburbs of younger residents, created an atmosphere of instability. Rental property, with absentee landlords, burgeoned and the social fabric of the neighborhood weakened. 
In 1970, residents recognized the potential of South Oakland and began a revitalization effort by going door to door to recruit neighbors to help with the task of stabilizing and strengthening the community. They asked those they contacted what they felt they could do in addition to what they felt was needed. The concept of doing was important because it exemplified the belief that people become empowered through the discovery and exercise of their strengths and abilities. 
The neighbors who were involved encouraged other neighbors to come to a storefront drop-in center designed to give the residents an opportunity to get to know each other. Informal activities such as bingo, knitting and cards, along with the sharing of diverse ethnic foods began. 
These early efforts reflect the settlement house concept organized at the turn of the century. The purpose is to organize and create services that are comprehensive, managed often by indigenous persons, and that become occasions to mix groups of people in environments that promote celebration.
Sleep-In for the Homeless.
On October 17, 2008, CHSC held the first Sleep-In for the Homeless. This was a homelessness awareness event as well as a fundraiser for CHSC's homelessness programs. The event was held at the City-County building in downtown Pittsburgh. Three hundred individuals showed up for the evening's festivities, which included the "Home Is Where The Heart Is" awards. Approximately one hundred individuals chose to sleep overnight on the portico of the City-County Building. Sleep-Ins continue to be held each year; the most recent took place on October 19, 2012.

Astro Fighter Sunred

Plot.
The story revolves around the Tama River area, based mostly in Kawasaki City Kanagawa where battles are fought between the evil organisation Florsheim and the ally of justice Sunred. The twist is that Sunred (referred to most characters familiar with him as simply 'Red') is a rough-talking, violent and rude hero while the villains of Florsheim (led by General Vamp) are for the most part polite, conscientious and easy-going.
Despite this, both sides still stay true to their roles, with Florsheim dedicated to destroying Sunred and taking over the world while Sunred battles against them. Other evil organisations and heroes are also mentioned from time to time.
Each episode is divided into various shorts of varying length. Most of the humour comes from the interactions of the characters, especially the main trio of Sunred, his girlfriend Kayoko and General Vamp. Kayoko and Vamp, for example, get along very well and she occasionally consults him about housework or cooking. In contrast, she and Sunred often argue like a long married couple.

Uldis Ģērmanis

Uldis Ģērmanis (4 October 1915 — 19 December 1997) was a Latvian historian, writer and publicist born in Novaya Ladoga, Russian Empire. His father was Jānis Ģermanis, and his family returned to the newly independent Latvia in 1919.
He taught history at the University of Latvia in Riga from 1943 and obtained his Masters degree. During World War II, he was mobilised in Latvian Legion and served in 19th. waffen grenadier division of the SS as military reporter. A few days before German capitulation, he emigrated to Sweden, where he settled in Solna. In 1974, he received his doctorate in history from the University of Stockholm.
Ģērmanis was, since 1935, a lifelong member of the Latvian student fraternity Fraternitas Livonica. His speciality was modern Latvian history, especially of the Soviet Union and the Latvian Riflemen. His ground-breaking work on Jukums Vācietis and the Latvian Riflemen's role in the Bolshevik Revolution paved the way for further research on this subject by other Latvian émigré historians, notably the early works of Andrew Ezergailis.
His book "Zili stikli, zaļi ledi" (Blue glass, green ice; 1968) describes his experience researching the story of Vācietis. Ģērmanis was one of the rare émigré Latvians allowed access to primary sources in the Latvian SSR at the time. In the book, he describes the suspicion he was met with by both the Soviet Latvian authorities, and by his fellow émigrés, who questioned his motives for researching the history of pro-Bolshevik Latvians.
In 1958, Ģērmanis living in exile completed ""The Latvian Saga"", which presents Latvian history, but reads like a novel. As the Latvian Embassy in the USA writes on their homepage: ""It describes the people, powers and events that made Latvia what it is today, and puts it all in a broader European context..."", ""...it inspired several generations of Latvians to dedicate their lives to the restoration of Latvia's independence in 1991"". In 2007 the eleventh edition was issued in an English version and the works of Ģērmanis are becoming increasingly popular in his native country as well.
Uldis Ģērmanis was elected a member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences in 1992 and awarded the Order of the Three Stars in 1995.

<doc id="20503234" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20503234" title="Bullo Pill Railway">
Bullo Pill Railway

The Bullo Pill Railway was an early British railway, completed in 1810 to carry coal mined in the Forest of Dean Coalfield to a port on the River Severn near Newnham, Gloucestershire. It was later converted to a broad gauge steam line by the Great Western Railway, and was closed in the 1960s.
Background.
The Forest of Dean has been exploited, not merely for its timber, but also for the minerals beneath, since ancient times. All the ingredients for iron-making exist and have been used since the Roman period. The Industrial Revolution brought increased demand for coal and iron, but the Forest, while having both in abundance, was at a disadvantage, being isolated from its potential markets with only a few frequently impassable roads linking it to the outside world. The hilly terrain was unsuitable for the canals of the type which were being built elsewhere, but in the first decade of the nineteenth century plans were laid for a number of horse-drawn railways to carry goods cheaply to the Rivers Severn and Wye.
Development.
Bullo Pill, on the Severn near Newnham, originally a small tidal creek off the main river used for boat building, was developed by building a dock basin with lock gates, and wharfs for loading goods for shipment. Coal and stone from the Forest could be loaded at the dock and exported on the Severn trows up or down the river. In addition there was a flow of barges carrying coal across the river to Framilode and then along the Stroudwater Canal to Brimscombe, Stroud and Chalford.
A private railway was built from Bullo Pill to Cinderford Bridge, a distance of nearly four and a half miles; when it was nearly complete, the Bullo Pill Railway Company applied for an Act of Parliament in order to extend the railway a further two miles to the summit of the hill above Churchway Engine, and to make branches. The Royal Assent to the Act was made on 10 June 1809.
The railway was of approximately 4 ft gauge, laid as a plateway, with rails of L-shaped section, spiked to stone blocks. Rails were supplied by the Ayleford Foundry, near Soudley; a branch line was constructed from the foundry. All traffic was horse-drawn, using privately owned four-wheeled wagons of an approved type, with an oak underframe supporting a hopper-shaped body, and with unflanged cast-iron wheels. The line was single, with frequent passing loops.
The tunnel at Haie (or Hay) Hill was 1,083 yards long, completed in 1810; at the time it was the longest railway tunnel in the world.
From Bullo Pill the line heads west for a mile to the entrance of Haie Hill Tunnel; emerging at the far end at Lower Soudley. From there, it follows the Cinderford valley northward through Upper Soudley, Cinderford Bridge and Bilson to Churchway.
In 1811-12 there was an attempt to excavate a tunnel under the River Severn, apparently as an extension to the railway. The tunnel began on the bank between Bullo Pill and Newnham, and was intended to emerge on the far side near Arlingham. The tunnel had been extended 226 yards out, about half way, but an inrush of water in November 1812 meant work was abandoned.
In 1812 the Severn and Wye Railroad Company line was exended to meet the Bullo Pill Railway at Churchway, but there seems initially to have been little traffic passing between the two.
The Forest of Dean Railway.
By 1815 Bullo Pill was shipping up to 1,000 tons of coal and stone daily, but the end of the Napoleonic Wars brought about a recession, and by the 1820s the railway was a shadow of its former self. It was bought by Edward Protheroe, who introduced plans to revitalize it. A second Act of Parliament received the Royal Assent on 5 May 1826; this turned the line into a public company, renamed the Forest of Dean Railway Company.
Industry.
The coming of the railway stimulated industry along its length, connected by sidings or short branches to the main line. There were collieries at Bilson, Crump Meadow, Churchway, Quidchurch, Foxes Bridge and numerous other locations, iron mines at Buckshaft, Shakemantle and St Annals, and stone quarries at Shakemantle and Staple Edge.
Two major ironworks operated close to the railway at Cinderford and Soudley.
Other industries included brickworks, chemical works, tinplate works and timber yards.
Broad Gauge conversion.
The South Wales Railway (a subsidiary of the Great Western Railway) bought the Forest of Dean Railway in 1849; their main line was opened in 1851 between Gloucester and Chepstow, and sidings were built at Bullo Pill for transfer of goods.
The Forest of Dean line was surveyed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1851 with a view to constructing a single-track broad gauge (7 ft 0¼ in) steam railway from the main line up to Churchway, with a branch to Whimsey. Although it approximately followed the line of the earlier railway, it was more heavily engineered with embankments, cuttings and tunnels, which tended to straighten out the earlier somewhat meandering course. Haie Hill Tunnel was enlarged, and new tunnels were dug at Bradley Hill (299 yards) and Blue Rock (109 yards). The new line, seven and a quarter miles long, opened on 24 July 1854. The South Wales Railway was officially amalgamated with the Great Western Railway on 1 August 1863. The line was converted to standard gauge in 1872.
In 1871 the Mitcheldean Road & Forest of Dean Junction Railway was formed to extend the line from Whimsey northwards to link up with the Hereford, Ross & Gloucester Railway at Mitcheldean Road; the line was taken over by the GWR in 1878 and completed, but never fully opened.
Passenger traffic.
From the late 1890s, shipments from Bullo Pill declined, and the last cargo of stone left the dock in 1926. The lock gates collapsed and the basin silted up. The coal-loading chute was eventually scrapped.
Passenger traffic on the line began on 3 August 1907, a rail motor service with halts at Bullo Cross, Upper Soudley, Staple Edge, Ruspidge, Bilson, Whimsey and Steam Mills Crossing. From 6 April 1908 the opening of a new length of track allowed trains to continue to the Severn and Wye Railway station at Cinderford.
The line closed to passengers from 1 November 1958, while goods traffic continued until the entire branch was closed on 1 August 1967.
Surviving remnants.
The track was lifted by the end of 1969, but much of the line can still be traced on foot. The original mines and industrial buildings have long disappeared, and the route is now mainly rural.
Between Ruspidge and Bilson the route is now a linear park; sections of broad-gauge rail can be seen in use as fence posts. South of Ruspidge residential developments have encroached on the line, though the branch to Lightmoor Colliery can still be followed, and still retains many of its original stone sleeper blocks. Around Soudley the route is almost untouched and can easily be traced. The branch around Whimsey has largely been obliterated by roads and light industrial development. Between Haie Hill Tunnel and Bullo Pill, the line is mostly in private hands and has reverted to pasture, though the bricked-up tunnel entrance still exists.
In 1991 the dock at Bullo Pill was cleared of silt and new lock gates installed, but there remains little activity although some private boats are stored and refurbished there.

Silicon drift detector

Silicon drift detectors (SDDs) are X-ray radiation detectors used in x-ray spectrometry (EDS) and electron microscopy (EDX). Their chief characteristics compared with other X-ray detectors are:
Working principle.
Like other solid state X-ray detectors, silicon drift detectors measure the energy of an incoming photon by the amount of ionization it produces in the detector material. In the SDD, this material is high purity silicon with a very low leakage current. The high purity allows for the use of Peltier cooling instead of the traditional liquid nitrogen. The major distinguishing feature of an SDD is the transversal field generated by a series of ring electrodes that causes charge carriers to 'drift' to a small collection electrode. The 'drift' concept of the SDD (which was imported from particle physics) allows significantly higher count rates coupled with a very low capacitance of the detector.
In older detector designs, the collection electrode is centrally located with an external FET (field effect transistor) to convert the current into a voltage and thus represents the first stage of amplification. Newer designs integrate the FET directly into the chip, which greatly improves energy resolution and throughput. This is due to the reduction of capacitance between anode and FET, which reduces electronic noise.
Other designs move the anode and FET outside of the irradiated area. This causes a slightly longer response time, which leads to a slightly lower throughput (750,000 counts per second instead of 1,000,000). However, due to the smaller anode size, this leads to better energy resolutions (down to 123 eV for Mn Kα wavelength). Combined with improved or adapted signal processing, it is possible to maintain the Silicon drift detector's energy resolution up to 100,000 counts per second.

The Woman's World

"The Woman's World" was a Victorian women's magazine published by Cassell between 1886 and 1890, edited by Oscar Wilde between 1887 and 1889. 
Foundation.
In the late nineteenth century the market for periodicals was growing, and interest from women, who had always been the larger part of the market for fiction, increasing. Cassell and Co. launched a new magazine, "The Lady's World" in October 1886, intended to appeal to an aspirant middle-class audience of lady readers. It concentrated on fashion and trends among high society. Impressed by Wilde's journalism on the "Pall Mall Gazette", Wemyss Reid, the General Manager of Cassell & Co., wrote to Wilde in April 1887, enclosing several copies of the magazine. Wilde replied interestedly and suggested possible changes to the magazine. In May, he signed a contract for the editorship, to work two mornings a week and be paid a weekly salary of £6.
Wilde's editorship.
Wilde persuaded the publisher to change the title to "The Woman's World", the change of description indicated it positioned itself towards an emerging class of educated women reflecting their changing place in society. Stephen Calloway and David Colvin characterised the change as one which eliminated connotations of "bas-bourgeois snobbery and reflected his advanced views on female emancipation". The titular change was part of a wider strategy of focusing more on what women "think and feel" and not exclusively on what they wear.
Wilde managed to entice contributions from well-known writers and distinguished figures including Elisabeth of Wied (the Queen of Romania), Princess Christian and Marie Corelli. He even asked Queen Victoria to submit poems, but was refused. The magazine continued to publish articles on high society trends and fashion, but with a more artistic slant. Sarah Bernhardt wrote an essay on "The history of my tea gown", and Wilde offered to write an article in her name about her American tour.
Wilde wrote a column of literary notes and responses to readers. At one point he had to defend himself against early animal rights activists who objected his promotion of the "wearing of dead animals" in his fashion notes.
Wilde soon tired of his editorial work and often failed to turn up for work or attend meetings with the publishers. As a result he was dropped as editor, but the magazine was unable to continue without him.

Auriculariaceae

The Auriculariaceae are a family of fungi in the order Auriculariales. Species within the family were formerly referred to the "heterobasidiomycetes" or "jelly fungi", since many have gelatinous basidiocarps (fruit bodies) that produce spores on septate basidia. Around 100 species are known worldwide. All are believed to be saprotrophic, most growing on dead wood. Fruit bodies of several "Auricularia" species are cultivated for food on a commercial scale, especially in China.
Taxonomy.
History.
The family was established in 1897 by German mycologist Gustav Lindau to accommodate species of fungi having "gymnocarpous" basidiocarps (with the hymenium exposed) and "auricularioid" basidia (more or less cylindrical basidia with lateral septa). It included not only the genus "Auricularia", but also "Platygloea", "Jola", "Saccoblastia", and "Stypinella" (= "Helicobasidium"). In 1922, British mycologist Carleton Rea recognized the family as containing the genera "Auricularia", "Eocronartium", "Helicobasidium", "Platygloea", and "Stilbum". Both Lindau and Rea placed the family within the Auriculariales, but some subsequent authors placed it within the Tremellales. 
A radical revision was undertaken in 1984, when American mycologist Robert Bandoni used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the ultrastructure of the septal pore apparatus in the Auriculariales. This revealed that species of fungi with "auricularioid" basidia were not necessarily closely related and that "Auricularia" had more in common with "Exidia" and its allies (with "tremelloid" basidia), than with other auricularioid fungi. Bandoni therefore limited the Auriculariaceae to the genus "Auricularia".
Current status.
Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has confirmed that the Auriculariaceae belong within the order Auriculariales, but has also indicated that the family is not distinguishable from the Exidiaceae. The precise circumscription of families within the order has not yet been examined, but a clade containing "Auricularia" and "Exidia" species (plus their allies) equates to the Auriculariaceae.
Description.
The majority of species within the Auriculariaceae produce gelatinous basidiocarps (fruit bodies) on dead wood. In some these are conspicuous and may be ear-shaped, button-shaped, lobed, or effused. Their hymenophores (spore-bearing surfaces) may be smooth, warted, veined, or spiny. Some species, however, produce dry, leathery, or web-like fruit bodies resembling those of the corticioid fungi.
Distribution and habitat.
All species within the Auriculariaceae are thought to be saprotrophs, most of them wood-rotters typically found on dead attached or fallen wood. As a group, their distribution is cosmopolitan. According to a 2008 estimate, the Auriculariaceae contain 7 genera and over 100 species.
Economic importance.
Several species within the order are edible and two, "Auricularia auricula-judae" and "A. cornea", are cultivated on a commercial scale, particularly in China and southeast Asia. They are widely exported, in a dried or powdered state, as "black fungus", "cloud ears", or "wood ears".

Quotes.
"We believe that Mr. Greenspan should quit giving away puts on the equity market."
"Thus, we are willing to say stocks are irrationally exuberant, notably growth stocks, and, in particular, technology stocks."
"There is room for the Fed to create a bubble in housing prices, if necessary, to sustain American hedonism. And I think the Fed has the will to do so, even though political correctness would demand that Mr. Greenspan deny any such thing."
"Debt deflation is a beast of burden that capitalism cannot bear alone."
"Macroeconomic life after bubbles is not a self-correcting process of renewal, but a self-feeding process of debt deflation — to wit, it’s a Minsky Moment."
"Loosely defined, a Shadow Bank is a levered-up financial intermediary whose liabilities are broadly perceived as of similar money-goodness and liquidity as conventional bank deposits. These liabilities could be shares of money market mutual funds; or the commercial paper of Finance Companies, Conduits and Structured Investment Vehicles; or the repo borrowings of stand-alone Investment Banks and Hedge Funds; or the senior tranches of Collateralized Debt Obligations; or a host of other similar funding instruments."

Radio Happy Isles

Radio Happy Isles is a national radio station in the Solomon Islands, operated by the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation. It broadcasts from Honiara.
Its stated purpose is not only to broadcast news but also to "promote a sense of national unity and Reconciliation", in the aftermath of violent civil conflict, "uphold the cultural values of Solomon Islands and create programs that meet the educational and informational needs of the listener".
In 2001, its weekday programme began at 6 AM with a broadcasting of the national anthem, followed by a ten minute "morning devotion". Daily programmes included music, sports, and weather reports, as well as national and international news. International news was provided mainly through the rebroadcasting of programmes from the British Broadcasting Corporation, Radio New Zealand International and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio Australia. Some programmes were broadcasting in English, and others in Pijin. Specific programmes were broadcast on Saturdays and Sundays, including programmes with a religious focus on Sundays.
The name "Happy Isles" for Solomon Islands is based on a line in Tennyson's poem "Ulysses": "It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles". It was used as the title of a book about Solomon Islands by D.C. Horton (1966). The station's name was suggested by VSA volunteer training officer Hugh Young on his departure in 1976, but not adopted until a year or two later, by Station Manager Welshman Teilo. As a result, the "Happy Isles" was then widely adopted as a nickname for the whole country. It was used as the title of a 1999 book by Robert Seward, "Radio Happy Isles: Media and Politics at Play in the Pacific".

Big Clifty, Kentucky

Big Clifty is an unincorporated community in Grayson County, Kentucky, United States.
History of Big Clifty.
Clifty Creek crosses Highway 62 and the P & L railroad several miles to the southwest of Big Clifty. It is said that travelers named the town due to the limestone cliffs that arose on the sides of Clifty Creek. Accounts of residents from the past report that Big Clifty was a "boom town" that at one time had a post office, bank, feed mill, several dry goods stores and restaurants. The Ben Goodman school was the local "country school" and the town had numerous churches. In yesteryear nearby Clarkson was a tourist destination due to the numerous hotels near Grayson Springs, which were visited by guests who wished to experience the sulphur water's curative properties. Big Clifty benefited from the traffic going to Clarkson. Spurrier Mill was a grist mill on the Nolin River, several miles from Big Clifty which was a benefit to the economy. Like many rural Kentucky communities, as passenger rail-use decreased and transportation and commercial shipping routes changed, Big Clifty's boom town status disappeared.
Geography of Big Clifty.
The town itself is on flat land. The surrounding terrain is flat to rolling with 20 to 40 foot cliffs surrounding Petty Branch of Meeting Creek and Meeting Creek in the Northeast. Clifty Creek runs to the west of Big Clifty with high ridges and cliffs surrounding it. The small community of St. Paul is nearby Big Clifty and Rough River runs west of it. The geography around Rough River is rugged with very high ridges and 40–60 foot cliffs bordering the river in many areas.

Wyoming Highway 59

Wyoming Highway 59 is a long north–south state highway that runs from Douglas to the Montana–Wyoming State Line, where the roadway continues as Montana Highway 59.
Route description.
Douglas.
Wyoming Highway 59 begins its southern end at an intersection with I-25 BUS/US 20 BUS/US 26 BUS/US 87 BUS (W. Yellowstone Highway), the northern terminus of Wyoming Highway 94 (Esterbrook Road), and exit 140 of Interstate 25 in Douglas.
Highway 59 then intersects Wyoming Highway 93 just north of its start. Past WYO 93, Highway 59 travels around the northwest side Douglas and acts as a bypass. At there is a junction with Wyoming Highway 59C, a spur of WYO 59 and the former routing of WYO 59 through Douglas.
Douglas to Gillette.
Wyoming Highway 59 along its route between Gillette and Douglas to some is one of the most desolate or barren place in the country. At approximately or halfway to Wright, WYO 59 passes through Bill, an unincorporated community in Converse County. Bill consists of a combined gas station and rural post office serving local ranches and a hotel and diner for Union Pacific Railroad employees who take mandatory rests in the town Between Bill and Wright, WYO 59 leaves Converse County and enters Campbell County.
At , Highway 59 intersects Wyoming Highway 450 just south of Wright. WYO 450 heads east from here to Newcastle. Approximately north of the WYO 450 intersection, Highway 59 intersects Wyoming Highway 387 in Wright. WYO 387 travels west to Midwest and Edgerton. Wright is a town in Campbell County where settlement began in the 1970s, with the creation of the Black Thunder Coal Mine, the largest mine in the Powder River Basin and most productive mine in the United States. The town itself was incorporated in 1985. Established as a mining town, the majority of people living in Wright are employed by the various mines that surround it.
From Wright to Gillette there are no intersections with major highways and the landscape consists of buttes covered with short grasses. At into its route, Highway 59 enters Gillette as South Douglas Highway.
Gillette.
Gillette is a city and county seat of Campbell County. It is a small city centrally located in an area that is vital to the development of vast quantities of American coal, oil, and coal bed methane gas, as a result, the city calls itself the "Energy Capital of the Nation".
At about , WYO 59 intersects I-90 (Exit 126) and then enters downtown and intersects US 14/US 16/I-90 BUS at a "T" intersection at .
WYO 59 turns west onto 2nd Street and runs concurrent with US 14/US 16/I-90 BUS. Around , WYO 59 begins to turn north and intersects Wyoming Highway 50 (Skyline Drive). Wyoming Highway 50 used to be routed down 4J Road into Gillette. Sometime between 1980 and 1993, WYO 50 was transferred to Skyline Drive, which provides easier access to Interstate 90. At the intersection with WYO 50, I-90 BUS turns west to run concurrent with Highway 50 to Interstate 90. WYO 59 continues north concurrent with US 14 and US 16 out of Gillette.
East of Gillette.
At , and northwest of Gillette, WYO 59 ends its concurrency with US 14/US 16 at a four-way intersection east of the Gillette-Campbell County Airport. Highway 59 turns east onto its own routing north, US 14/US 16 continue north on their routing west, and Airport Road heads west into the Gillette-Campbell County Airport.
At approximately , WYO 59 passes through Weston. Weston is an unincorporated community in northern Campbell County, along the upper Little Powder River on the southeastern edge of the Thunder Basin National Grassland. Even though Weston is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 82731.
For the rest of the way through Campbell County, Highway 59 parallels Little Powder River that lies to the highway's east all the way to the state line.
Wyoming Highway 59 ends at the Montana-Wyoming state line. The highway continues north as Montana Highway 59 until its junction with Montana Highway 200 at Jordan, Montana.
Wyoming Highway 59 follows State Control Number P-43 for its entire length.
History.
Wyoming Highway 59 was formerly numbered "U.S. Route 185" prior to 1936. From 1936 and 1945, it was known as Wyoming Highway 387. After 1945, the road was known as Wyoming Highway 59. U.S. Route 185 was commissioned in 1926 to run from Cheyenne to Orin. It was proposed that US 185 continue north to Gillette, via US 20 between Orin and Douglas, and via Wyoming Highway 59 between Douglas and Gillette. But the road now carrying WYO 59 did not exist. So when Highway 59 was constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s, it carried the designation US 185. After the Great Recommissioning of 1936, Wyoming 185 was renumbered to Wyoming 387, since the route directly connected to the new U.S. 87, not U.S. 85. In 1945, the 387 designation was changed to WYO 59.
Wyoming Highway 59 Connector.
Wyoming Highway 59 Connector is a long connector route of WYO 59 in Douglas. WYO 59C is the original alignment of Wyoming Highway 59 through Douglas. The route begins at WYO 59 and heads south 0.45 of a mile to meet WYO 59 (Fourth St.)

Mulino (settlement), Nizhny Novgorod Oblast

Mulino () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Volodarsky District of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia. Population: Dialing code: +7 83136. Postal code: 606083.
Military.
There is a significant military presence in the area; a local newspaper describes Mulino as "surrounded by military units". An important facility in the area is the Mulino training center of the Russian Ground Forces, which in September and December 2007 was the site of joint US-Russian military exercises, part of the series codenamed "Torgau" (after the city in Germany that figures in the military history of both countries). Joint exercises at Mulino were originally planned for 2006 ("Torgau-2006"), but were canceled, possibly due to the protests of certain local groups against the presence of foreign military on Russian soil.
Among military units listed by Kommersant-Vlast in 2002 at Mulino were the 34th Guards Artillery Division, the 99th Guards Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment (3 MRD), the 211th Training Artillery Brigade, the 245th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment (3 MRD), the 752nd Motor Rifle Regiment, the 237th and 100th Tank Regiments (3rd Motor Rifle Division), one other unit, and a penal battalion. Headquarters 3rd Motor Rifle Division was nearby in Nizhny Novgorod.
There is also a penal battalion at the site.
Several military reorganizations have now occurred, and a listing of units at Mulino is now best accessed at [http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/russia/grand_force/districts/mvo.htm]. As of late 2009, units there appear to include 6th Independent Tank Brigade, 288th Artillery Brigade, and a rocket forces and artillery depot.
In 2014 a new training range site will be opened in Mulino, in accordance with an agreement signed with Germany’s Rheinmetall worth of €100-million-plus to build a brigade-sized live combat simulation and marksmanship training center.

Stearns Tavern

Stearns Tavern is a historic tavern at 651 Park Avenue in Worcester, Massachusetts. The building is one of the best extant examples of vernacular Federal style architecture in the city. Its construction is dated to c. 1812 based on 19th-century historical sources, and it was suggested that its frame may be even older, based on analysis conducted during a 1974 move of the building. The building is a two story timber frame house, with a two story ell on the northeast. The front door is a distinctive six-panel door, flanked by sidelights and topped by a fanlight. Originally located at 1030 Main Street, it was moved in 1974 to its present location and converted for use as a bank. Restoration done at the time exposed Federal style details that had been covered over in the intervening years.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Willem van Outhoorn

Willem van Outhoorn (4 May 1635 – 27 November 1720) was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1691 to 1704. He was born and died in the Dutch East Indies.
Biography.
Willem van Outhoorn (or "Oudthoorn") was born on 4 May 1635 at Larike on Ambon Island in Indonesia. His father was a Dutch East India Company (VOC) Buyer ("koopman") there. He was sent to the Netherlands to study Law at the University of Leiden. On 28 November 1657 he graduated in Law.
Government career.
In 1659 van Outhoorn returned to the Indies, employed as Underbuyer ("onderkoopman"). He was to remain in the East for the rest of his life. Even a journey to nearby Bantam was a journey too far for him. In 1662 he became a member of the Council of Justice ("Raad van Justitie") in Batavia. In 1672 he became Receiver-General ("ontvanger-generaal"), and in 1673 he became Vice-President of the Council of Justice. In 1678 he was charged with a mission to Bantam and he became an extraordinary member of the Dutch Council of the Indies. He was named a full Counsellor, being confirmed in that post in 1681. He became President of the Council of Justice in 1682 and in 1689 President of the College van Heemraden (dealing with estate boundaries, roads, etc.). That same year he was appointed First Counsellor and Director-General of the Dutch East Indies.
On 17 December 1690 van Outhoorn was appointed Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, taking over from Johannes Camphuys on 24 September 1691. After ten years, the Seventeen Lords (Heren XVII) granted his wish to be honourably relieved of his duties, but it was 15 August 1704 before he could hand over all his official functions to his successor, Joan van Hoorn.
He requested that he be allowed to remain on his estate just outside Batavia. Such requests were generally not allowed, for fear that retired governors would interfere with the work of their successors. However, because he was in ill-health and was over 70, he was allowed to stay. He died at age 85 on 27 November 1720 in Batavia.
His term of office was not marked by many important developments or events. At the end of his term, Amangkurat II Sultan of Mataram died. As the VOC did not recognise his son as successor, a long war broke out just before Van Outshoorn left office. In 1693 the French overran Pondicherry. During his time, efforts were made to establish coffee growing in Java. The first harvest failed because of flooding, but the next harvest had more success. 
Van Outhoorn was not a very strong ruler. Corruption and nepotism, in which he was also involved, became more blatant during his time. His son-in-law Joan van Hoorn, married to his daughter Susanna, followed him as Governor-General.

Truc

Truc, pronounced in France and in Spain, is a 15th-century bluff and counterbluff trick-taking card game which has been reasonably likened to Poker for two. It is played in Occitania, Sarthe (where it is known as "trut"), Poitou ("tru") and the Basque Country ("truka"), and is still very popular in the Valencia region ("joc del truc"). More elaborate versions are widely played in Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Paraguay and Brazil under such names as Truco, Truque and Truquiflor.
History.
The game of Truc probably originates from the end of the Middle Ages in Spain, regarding the etymology of the word, which means "trick" (or to trick into false announcements), later migrating to France.
The "Diccionario de Pompeu Fabra" states that Truc is a game of cards usually played by four players, each receiving three cards and scoring points for winning two of the three tricks, and whose bluffing objective is to trick the opponent into conceding the number of points summed by the point value of two cards of the same suit under a vie, and in some variants of Truquiflor, by having Flor or a winning Flor (a group of three consecutive cards of the same suit) whose point value is higher than another."Truc: "joc de cartes que es juga ordinàriament entre quatre persones que van dues contra les altres dues, cadascuna de les quals rep tres cartes i cada bandol guanya punts guanyant dues bases (guanyar el truc), les cartes matantse le unes a les altres segons un ordre establert, y fent objecte d'envit el guanyar el truc (trucar) o el nombre de punts que sumen els valor de dues cartes del mateix coll [palo acoblades en una mà (envidar), i, en algunes variants del joc (truquiFlor), pel fet de tenir Flor o una Flor guanyadora d'una altra"."</ref>
Francesc de Borja i Moll, in his Diccionari Català, offers a similar definition, recalling the hierarchy of the cards as: 3 2 A K Q J 9 8 7 6, and a brief entry on the Matarrata variant, a similar game in which the 7 ranks higher than 7 , A and A ."Matarrata… truc d’espaseta: joc semblant al truc, del qual es diferencia perquè el set és guanyat pel set d’oros, aquest pel d’espases, aquest per l’as de bastos i aquest per l’as d’espases."</ref>
Truc is closely related to the old English game of put, which was first described by Cotton in "The Compleat Gamester" (1674).
Game.
Two players use a 32-card pack ranking 7 8 A K Q J 10 9 in each suit. A rubber is the best of three games, and a game is 12 points, which may require several deals to reach. Players deal in turn with the first dealer being chosen by any agreed means.
Players receive 3 cards dealt in 1s. The aim in each deal is to win two tricks, to win the first trick if it comes to be that both players win one and the third is tied, by making the opponent fold to a raise. Non-dealer may also propose a redeal if dealer agrees. The hands are put aside and each receives 3 new cards. Only one redeal may be made, and only if both players agree.
Play.
Non-dealer leads to the first trick and the winner of each trick leads to the next. As Truc is a no-trump game, any card may be played by either player and tricks are taken by the highest card led regardless of the suit played. If both play cards of equal ranks, the trick is then considered "spoilt", belonging to none of the players, and the same leader leads to the next.
Score.
Theoretically, the winner scores one point to every game. However, before playing to a trick, either player may offer to increase the score for a win by asking: "Two more ?". The first such increase raises the value from 1 point to 2, and subsequently increases add 2 more each, raising the game value from 2 to 4, than 6, and so on. If the other says: "Yes", play continues, if not he throws his hand in, play ceases and the challenger scores whatever it was worth before he offered to raise. It is possible for both players to raise in the same trick (the leader before leading to a trick and, if accepted, the follower before replying). It is also legal to concede at any time, even if the other has not just offered to double.
Mon reste
An even more drastic raise may be made if either players on his turn to play may declare: "My remainder (Mon reste), thus jump-raising the game value to whatever he needs to make 12. To this, however, the opponent may either concede, in which case the increase does not take effect, or may himself announce "My remainder", in which whomever wins the deal wins the game. The round finishes when one player concedes or when trick tricks have been completed. Whoever took three tricks, or the first if each took one, scores the point, or whatever value it may have been increased to. If all three tricks were spoilt, neither player scores.
Partnership Truc.
Four players sit crosswise in partnerships. The turn to deal and play is counter-clockwise. The dealer acts as governor for his partnership and eldest hand as governor for his. Only eldest may propose an exchange, and only dealer may accept or refuse it. Eldest leads to the first trick, and each subsequent trick is led by the winner of the last, or by the previous leader if the trick is spoilt. Similarly, only the governor may accept or concede when an increase is proposed.
Throughout play, governor's partner may indicate what card or cards he holds by means of conventional code or gestural signals, and the governor for his part may tell his partner what to play. Players may not reverse these roles. The holding of a Seven is indicated by a grin, an Eight by a wink, an Ace by a shrug. Naturally, the signaller will attempt to signal when his governor is looking and his opponents are not. An instruction may take the form: "Play the Seven", "Play low", "Leave it to me", and so on. Signals must be truthfully made, and instructions obeyed.
A trick is spoilt if the highest card played by one side is matched in rank by the highest card played by one of the other. In case of a tie-winning trick played by two partners, whichever of them led to it first, leads two the next, and if neither of them two led, the trick is then spoilt just as if one of the tied cards were played by the other side.

Stevens' Building

Stevens' Building is a historic commercial building at 24-44 Southbridge Street in downtown Worcester, Massachusetts. It is one of the city's most imposing mid-19th century buildings. The brick building is four stories for most of its length on Southbridge Street, and also presents a finished facade to Burnside Court. The central portion rises to a full five stories with a flat roof, while the north and south sections are four floors with a low pitch roof. The oldest portion of the building was the central portion, built sometime in the 1850s. The Stevens Brothers, manufacturers of wooden architectural building parts, purchased this building c. 1867, extended it northward to Burnside Court, and used it as factory space. By 1870 they had bought the land south of the building, and erected as a freestanding building seven bays of the present building. The two buildings were then joined together later in the 1870s. The fifth floor of the central section was probably added after a fire in the early 1900s.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Sacred bundle

Sacred bundle are medicine bundles or collections of sacred items held by designated carriers from Native American tribes. According to a Harvard University report, tribal elders are entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the bundles.
According to Patricia Deveraux, a member of the Blackfeet tribe in Alberta, "These are holy bundles given to us by the Creator to hold our people together... They're the same as the relics from the Catholic Church. They are a demonstration of the holy spirit. They can heal people."
Pawnee.
Sacred bundles are a powerful part of Pawnee ceremonies linked to planting and harvesting. They contain tools necessary to those ceremonies, and the rituals and ceremonies associated with them are passed from generation to generation along with the bundles. Bundles are owned by women and inherited through the female line, but can be used by men only. According to Black Elk of the Oglala Lakota, the first woman chosen to care for the sacred bundle was Red Day Woman, and all women subsequently chosen to care for the sacred bundle were regarded as holy people.
To open or use a bundle without the proper ritual and ceremony portends disaster. 
Bundle contents vary according to ritual and customs. A bundle at the Kansas State Historical Society has been x-rayed to identify its contents, which are wrapped in an ocher-stained bison hide. There are several ceremonial objects tied to the outside of the bundle, including a long smoking pipe, arrow fragments, a meat fork tipped with a raccoon bone, and small American flags. According to the x-ray analysis inside are stuffed bird bundles, hawk bells, counting sticks, and glass beads sewn on a leather strip.
Some Pawnee kept intricate star charts in their bundles.
Mesoamerica.
The sacred bundle is also known from Mesoamerica, particularly from the Aztecs and the Quiché Mayas (see Popol Vuh). The pre-Aztec Borgia Codex uniquely visualizes the mystic powers emanating from such a bundle. Bundles held by members of the royal family are particularly prominent in the art of the Classic Maya kingdom of Yaxchilan.

Toro Negro State Forest

Toro Negro State Forest (Spanish: "Bosque Estatal de Toro Negro") is one of the 21 forests that make up the public forests system in Puerto Rico. It is also Puerto Rico's highest cloud forest. It is located in the Cordillera Central region of the island and covers , i.e., 32.24 km2, of mountains. Toro Negro's mountains have heights reaching up to 4,400 feet and include Cerro de Punta, Cerro Jayuya and Cerro Rosa, the three highest peaks in the island. Nested among these mountains is Lake Guineo, the island's highest lake. The forest has 18 kilometers of trails, an observation tower, two natural swimming pools (Spanish:""charcos""), camping and picnic areas, nine rivers, and numerous creeks and waterfalls. The forest spans areas within the municipalities of Ponce, Jayuya, Orocovis, Ciales, and Juana Díaz, and consists of seven non-contiguous tracts of land. The largest contiguous segment of the forest is located in the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya. Some 40% of the area of Toro Negro State Forest is located in Ponce's Barrio Anón.
When created in 1935 as part of the Caribbean National Forest, the Toro Negro Forest Reserve was managed by the United States government, first via the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration of the Department of the Interior (1935-1942) and later through the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture (1942-1970). Then, in 1970, the Federal Government exchanged with the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico the Toro Negro section of the Caribbean National Forest for some forested lands belonging to the Commonwealth and located adjacent to the much larger federal lands at Luquillo National Forest resulting in the creation at Luquillo of the current El Yunque National Forest. In 1970, the Government of Puerto Rico's Departmento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales (DRNA) opened the Toro Negro Forest Reserve as a Commonwealth state forest and renamed it "Bosque Estatal de Toro Negro" (Toro Negro State Forest).
History.
In 1876, Spanish King Alfonso XII of Spain issued the first proclamation for the creation of forest reserves in Puerto Rico. The land where Toro Negro sits was originally used for coffee plantations until the 1930s when a program of reforestation was commenced.
In 1934, those lands were acquired by the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA). The forest started with a total of in 1934. In 1935, of private lands were purchased by the PRRA. The forest was not a separate entity at the time; it was part of the Caribbean National Forest, and was administered by the U.S. Forest Service as the Toro Negro Division of the Caribbean National Forest. Additional lands brought the total size of the Toro Negro purchase that year to , and at least an additional were in the process of being acquired in 1936. Between 1934 and 1945 over 3 million seedlings and approximately 19,000 pounds of seeds were sown on of the forest. Twenty-eight species were planted in twenty-nine different plantations. In 1942, the US Department of the Interior transferred the forest to the United States Department of Agriculture. From 1942 to 1961, it was administered by the US Forest Service. During these years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture continued its acquisition of lands increasing the acreage of Toro Negro.
In 1961, Toro Negro was transferred to the Government of Puerto Rico. The transfer was finalized on 21 May 1962, when the of land that constituted the Toro Negro Unit of the Caribbean National Forest were signed away to the Government of Puerto Rico by the Federal Government. Of these , were exchanged for located adjacent to the Luquillo Unit of the Caribbean National Forest. The remaining were ceded to Puerto Rico's Department of Agriculture for forestry purposes. This resulted in the Toro Negro State Forest. Since 1962, approximately 120 cuerdas have been planted to eucalyptus, mahoe, kadam and Honduran Pine. In 1962, Toro Negro had , representing 11.32% of Puerto Rico's state forests. In 1962 the Area Recreacional Doña Juana was added to Toro Negro. In April 1970, a land exchange which included the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture purchase and transfer of forest lands adjacent to Luquillo Experimental Forest in exchange for the complete transfer of Toro Negro forest lands to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
The lower elevations of Toro Negro used to be important coffee-producing plantations, however, the entire forest is especially critical for water and soil conservation. Today, the amount of tree foliage coverage in the forest ranges from 81% in the moist forest zone to 99% in the lower montane wet forest zone. The forest was named for the Río Toro Negro, one of nine rivers that flow out of the forest, and the name of one of the barrios in the Ciales portion of the forest.
Protected area.
Toro Negro is a protected area under the law. The forest has a protected status of "IV" (""Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources"") according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) convention. Ecological protection is managed and enforced by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources.
Through the "parcelero" (from the Spanish root for "parcel", or land lot) program, people who were living in the lands being incorporated into the reserve during the federal government land acquisitions of 1935 were allowed to stay in their places when forest protection went into effect.
In January 1999, a bill in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives sought to increase the size of the protected area by unifying the Toro Negro, Guilarte, and Pueblo de Adjuntas State Forests. In a March 2008 study by its International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF), the U.S. Department of Agriculture classified Toro Negro State Forest as a Commonwealth of Puerto Rico forest of "Status 2", s status it defines as ""an area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a primarily natural state, but which may receive use or management practices that degrade the quality of existing natural communities."" As of 2013, there were ongoing governmental initiatives in place to acquire, from private owners, additional lands adjacent to the Toro Negro State Forest to increase the protected area of the forest as well as to create a wildlife forest corridor that would join Toro Negro with the nearby Tres Picachos and Guilarte state forests through plans such as the federal Forest Legacy Areas initiative.
Location.
Toro Negro is located in the central mountainous region of Puerto Rico and it has a total area of 8,203.6977 "cuerdas", or 7,967.6109 acres. It is located in remote areas of the Cordillera Central mountain range. The forest office is at km. 32.4 of Route PR-143, east of the intersection with Route PR-149. The forest distribution encompasses a range from 18°07'30” N and 18°15'00” N to 66°30'00” W and 66°37'30” W. The forest ranger's office and visitor's area are located on Puerto Rico Highway 143 Km 32.4 in Barrio Ala de la Piedra, Orocovis at 18.17342°N, 66.49231°W
(). The largest sections of the forest are located in the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya, both of which are municipalities in the Puerto Rico Tourism Company's Porta Caribe tourism zone. Cerro de Punta , the highest peak in Puerto Rico, is located in the western section of the forest and the lowest elevation is found at the south edge of the forest near Salto de Inabón (Inabón Falls), an altitude of approximately .
Forest types.
Four vegetation associations have been delineated in two bioclimatic life zones. The two climatic biome zones are: the subtropical moist forest life zone (31% of the forest) and the lower mountain wet forest life zone (the remaining 69% of the forest). The topography is accentuated by a large number of steep slopes and high waterfalls. Toro Negro subforests are catalogued on the basis of their elevation and content. From Cerro Maravilla, one of the tallest peaks in the forest, four of Puerto Rico's distinct forest types can be seen: Bosque Tabonuco, Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia, Bosque Sierra de Palmas, and Bosque enano.
Bosque Tabonuco forest.
At the lower elevations of the forest (below 2,000 feet above sea level) stands the Bosque Tabonuco forest which is dominated by the majestic Tabonuco tree (Dacryodes excelsa) that can reach up to 100 feet (30 m) and grows primarily in protected sites at low elevations. The Tabonuco forest has many of the characteristics for which tropical rain forests are noted. The forest canopy has three levels: an upper level that may be as much as 35% Tabonuco, a lower canopy, and an under story. The second most prominent tree in this forest type, the Montillo (Sloanea berteroana), has large buttress roots, typical of many rain forest trees. Such roots help support the heavy canopy of large trees growing in very wet soil. The forest floor is only scarcely vegetated, but the forest canopy is rich with aerial plants: bromeliads, orchids, vines, and arboreal ferns. The tabonuco type dominates in the subtropical wet life zone.
Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest.
Above 2,000 feet (600m) is the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest. Tree height in the Micropholis Buchenavia forest is less than 50 feet (15m), and the layers of the forest canopy are less distinct than in the Tabonuco type. Micropholis and Buchenavia (Granadillo) are the dominant species in this lower montane zonal vegetation association.
Sierra de Palmas forest.
At about the same elevation as the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest (above 2,000 feet), but on very steep slopes, are the Sierra de Palmas forests dominated by the Sierra Palm (Prestoea montana). Sometimes called palm-breaker, this forest type may reach 50 feet (15m) in height. The Sierra de Palmas covers the largest area of all forest types in Toro Negro. The palm forest is distinguishable at a great distance by the form and size of leaves and by the general pale green color of the foliage. Below elevation the palms appear as scattered elements; however at higher elevations the sierra palm becomes a dominant species over a large area. The trunk of the sierra palm is straight, erect, cylindrical and attains heights of 10–15 m. The pinnate leaves are mostly 2.0-2.5 meters long and cast a dense shade on the ground. The palm forest, nearly always a single species dominant is normally open and free from undergrowth of any kind. The globose fruits are somewhat more than one centimeter in diameter and produced in great abundance.
Bosque Enano forest.
At the highest elevations, near the top of Cerro de Punta, Cerro Maravilla and similar peaks, grows the Bosque enano forest, also known as dwarf forest, cloud forest, elfin forest and moss forest. This forest type is composed of very dense stands of small, stunted trees and shrubs. The cloud forest has many of the same tree species as the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest, but growth is limited by adverse climate—heavy rain, strong winds, and almost constant cloud cover.
The dwarf or cloud forest developed in the higher peaks of the Central Cordillera is quite different in general appearance from the cloud forest of Sierra Luquillo Mountains due to the less rigorous environment in Toro Negro. The physical effect of the wind is much reduced; the shrubs are neither bent nor shorn to an even surface, but are essentially erect and their crowns are rounded and uneven in outline. The mosses are reduced to a thin mantle on the more sheltered trunks and are absent in many places, while the great mats of Selaginella are completely lacking.
In the Toro Negro forest, only the most inaccessible mountain tops have never been cleared. Most of the lower areas are subject to the familiar routine of logging, clearing, burning, and grazing or semi-permanent cultivation. Most of the forest lands in Toro Negro rise above the upper limit of successful coffee cultivation.
Geology.
Toro Negro State Forest has both deep soils and surface soils. Deep soils are derived from volcanic igneous rock, fine-grained. These contain high amounts of permeable clay, low amounts of sand, silt, and high amounts of iron and aluminum, but little silica. The surface soils are acidic and brittle while the subsoil is acidic and heavy, but permeable. Its hills are mostly steep. Usually the top soil is lost by erosion.
There are nine rivers that flow south (Río Indalecia, Río Guayo, Río Inabón, Río Blanco, Río Anón and Río Prieto), and three that flow north (Río Saliente, Río Toro Negro, and Río Matrullas) from the forest. The Matrullas and Guineo reservoirs are also part of the forest. Río Toro Negro - after which the forest is named - separates the municipalities of Ciales and Orocovis; it also forms Lago El Guineo. The forest's other lake, Lago Matrullas, is accessible via Puerto Rico Highway 564, in the municipality of Orocovis.
Flora.
Toro Negro has four vegetation associations catalogued into two subtropical moist life zones: The first is a Subtropical Moist Zone (Zona Muy Húmeda Subtropical) and consists of the Tabonuco forest (Bosque de Tabonuco). The second is the Lower Mountain Wet Zone (Zona Muy Húmeda Montaña Abajo). This zone consists of three sub forests: the Micropholis Buchenavia forest (Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia), the Mountain Palm forest (Bosque de Palma de Sierra), and the Dwarf forest (Bosque Enano).
E. L. Little and F. H. Wadsworth reported a total of 160 tree species distributed amongst 53 families. The largest families are: Melastomaceae (16 species), Lauraceae (11 species) and Myrtaceae (10 species).
Ferns and orchids are abundant. Forty of the species found in this forest are endemic to Puerto Rico and thirteen are introduced species. The fern Thelypteris inabonensis, endemic to this forest and found only at the headwaters of Rio Inabon and at the Toro Negro's Cerro Rosa in Ciales, has been identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an endangered species.
Some of the more common trees are: "tabonuco" (Dacryodes excelsa), "ausubo" (Manilkara bidentata), "jagüilla" (Magnolia portoricensis), "nuez moscada" (Ocotea moschata), "granadillo" (Buchenavia capitata), "maga" (Montezuma speciosissima), "higüerillo" (Vitex divaricata), "almedrón" (Prunus occidentalis) and "jácana" (Pouteria multiflora). In addition "Palmas de sierra" (Prestoea montana) and "helechos arbóreos" (Cyathea Sp.) are very abundant. Some of the species that were introduced to this forest are "mahoe" (Hibiscus elatus Sw.), "caoba hondureña" (Swietenia macrophylla), "pino hondureño" (Pinus caribaea), "eucalipto" (Eucalyptus robusta) and "kadam" (Anthocephalus chinensis).
Ilex cookii, commonly known as Cook's Holly or te, is a small evergreen holly shrub known to exist only in the Toro Negro State Forest and only in extremely limited amounts. It is listed as a critically endangered species by the IUCN and protected by law.
Between 1935 and 1943, 28 species of trees were planted in Toro Negro. Their plantings (either via seeding or via planting of saplings) consisted of both native and exotic species. Nineteen native species were planted as follows (the quantity planted/seeded is shown after the species; and X means experimental planting only):
The nine exotic species were:
Fauna.
There are 30 species of birds reported, including 6 endemic species and two that are endangered: the Puerto Rican Sharp-shinned Hawk (Vernacular Spanish: "Falcón de Sierra"; Taxonomy: Accipiter striatus venator) and Puerto Rican Broad-winged Hawk (Vernacular Spanish: "Guaragüao de bosque"; Taxonomy: Buteo platypterus brunnescens). The Puerto Rican parrot (Vernacular Spanish: "Cotorra puertorriqueña"; Taxonomy: Amazona vittata), a critically endangered species, has also been seen in this forest.
Recent studies have identified eight species of bats. They are most visible at dusk as this is when these nocturnal critters are out foraging for food, primarily mosquitoes. The 13 species of bats living in the forest play an important ecological role in controlling mosquitoes, which not only carry diseases but also harass hikers. The three most prevalent bat species are the greater bulldog bat, Antillean ghost-faced bat and the sooty mustached bat.
There are 20 species of reptiles and amphibians and, with the exception of Bufo marinus (Spanish: "Sapo común"), all are endemic. Reptiles include the "Lagarto verde" (Anolis cuvieri), "lagartijo pigmeo" (Anolis occultus), and "boa de Puerto Rico" (Epicrates inornatus), which is in danger of extinction; amphibians include the "siguana" (Ameiva exsul) and the "culebra ciega" (Amphisbaena caeca). Amphibians include "coquí común" (Eleutherodactylus coqui) and the "coquí de la montaña" (Eleutherodactylus portoricensis), a species denominated as vulnerable under Puerto Rico Law 6766. The Small Asian Mongoose (Vernacular Spanish: "Mangosta pequeña asiática"; Taxonomy: Herpestes javanicus), has also been spotted inhabiting this forest.
Toro Negro State Forest is home to 11 species of snakes, all non-venomous to humans. The Puerto Rican boa (Epicrates inornatus) grows 6 to 7 feet in length and weighs about 2 pounds. It is a heavy-bodied snake with tan to dark brown body color and dark blotches down its back. It will defend itself with a bite, but kills its prey by suffocation. It is a protected species due to over-harvesting to collect oil and skins. It is nocturnal and prefers to remain under cover during the day and hunt at night. The Puerto Rican Racer ("Culebra Corredora"; Alsophis portoricensis) grows to 3 feet. It slinks around in the trees of the Toro Negro Forest. His body sports a solid brown color with each of his scales edged by a darker brown. Like the forest's other various garden snakes, it is a daytime hunter. The forest also features blind snakes. They spend nearly their entire lives underground but do sometimes take cover under rotting trees. They do not bite as they do not have teeth.
Its rivers and lakes are home to several species of fish and crustaceans. Fish found here include Dajao (Vernacular English: "Mountain Mullet"; Taxonomy: Agonostomus monticola) and "Olivo" (Sicydium plumieri), also known as "Ceti". Some crustaceans are the "camarón bocu" (Macrobrachium crenulatum), "gata" (Atya lanipes), and "buruquena" (Epilobocera sinuatifrons), all endemic to Puerto Rico.
Facilities.
With the exception of the "Salto de Doña Juana" waterfall, all of the forest facilities, including all trails, are located within the municipality of Orocovis and they are collectively known as the "Doña Juana Recreational Area." Guided tours are available or visitors explore on their own. Ziplining is also a common activity in the Toro Negro forest. The forest office, staffed by personnel from the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, provides maps of the forest and its trails and services, weather conditions information, and mud slides danger levels. Among the facilities available at Toro Negro are a camping area, a recreational area, a system of hiking trails and observation points.
Trails.
Officially there are 10 hiking trails covering 18 kilometers. They are provided for hiking as well as to facilitate bird and landscape watching, meditation, and similar activities. While the official number of trails is stated as 10, some of the trails are actually dirt roads for park ranger vehicles. Also, some of the "trails" require the hiker to walk a segment on a paved Commonwealth road or county road. Trails are generally quite wide, but being a forest in mountains with high humidity and rain precipitation, many of the trails are muddy in at least some areas. Hikers are often seen with walking sticks, which help maintain balance when walking on slippery surfaces, particularly the algae-covered ground rocks present on some of the trails. Some of the trails lead to or run near "charcos". Charcos are natural swimming pools (swimming holes). The Toro Negro State Forest office is the starting point for several of the trails. However, most of the trails are not well marked, nor are they well kept, so they can be hard to locate and to follow in the dense forest. The 10 official trails are:
Trail #1 (""El Bolo"").
Named "Camino El Bolo", it is the forest's longest trail, about 2 miles long, and essentially a loop around Cerro El Bolo. This trail has its course along Cerro El Bolo (El Bolo Mountain), Puerto Rico's tenth tallest peak at above sea level. It is a low challenge trail. It is essentially a loop that starts at the visitor's parking area on PR-143 and terminates on PR-143 about 1/4 mile north of the visitor's parking area, from where hikers simply walk the road back to the parking area. Starting off at the visitor's parking area, hikers cross PR-143 to head south on the trail. This section of the forest has lots of banana trees and flowers along its way and starts off with a steep uphill climb. Approximately 0.4 mile into the trail, the trail starts to head East and flattens out as it becomes a rocky at first and then grassy further on. Another 0.4 mile heading East the trail connects to Trail #6 which leads to the swimming pool. Continuing East another 0.2 miles, the trail becomes uphill again as it connects to the northernmost point of a paved road, Puerto Rico Highway 561, on the right hand side. From this point on the trail starts to head North on a downhill grade but in less than 0.1 mile it connects to Trail #3 which leads to the Observation Tower, where there is a sign that reads "La Torre" ("The Tower"). The trail continuous downhill North-Northwest about 0.8 mile until it reaches paved road PR-143, in the vicinity of km 32.6. From this point hikers make a left to walk southwest bound on PR-143 (that is, "West" on PR-143) until reaching the Visitor's area at km 32.4.
Trail #3 (Observation Tower).
This trail leads to the Observation Tower. This trail if for advanced hikers. Trail #3 does not start at the visitor's parking area, so hikers must first hike on other trails to get to Trail #3. Starting from the visitor's parking area, there are three ways to get to Trail #3. Path Option 1: This is the shortest route. Hikers get on PR-143, walking northeast bound (that is, making a left from the parking area to head "East" on PR-143) about 0.25 miles, make a right into the forest at the sign (""Verada #6 - Piscina"") to get on Trail #6, hike the 0.8 mile of Trail #6 to its end, make a left into Trail #1 and hike about 0.3 mile to the beginning of Trail #3. Path Option 2: This is the second shortest route. Hikers take Trail #1 as described above under section "Trail #1" until they reach Trail #3 where there is a sign that reads "Observation Tower". Path Option 3: This is the longest route. Hikers head northeast bound (that is, "East" on PR-143) passed the sign stating "Trail #6 - La Piscina (this will be about 0.25 mile hike), and continue northeast bound for approximately another 0.25 mile until the sign stating "Trail #1 - Camino Bolo where hikers make a right into the forest and continue this trail about 0.9 mile until coming to Trail #3.
Once on Trail #3, hikers climb this trail about 0.6 miles to its top where the observation tower is located. The trail to the observation tower lookout hill is not for the faint of heart. It is very steep and very slippery. It is a one-way trail (in the sense that the same trail is used in the return trip) and the trail feels even more slippery in the downhill return hike. This trail is made of rocks but, because of the high humidity and low traffic, algae have overtaken the rocks to make the trail very slippery. Walking around the rocks does not always help as the area is muddy - though albeit less slippery. The view and fresh air and breeze make the trek quite rewarding. The views are unobstructed and panoramic 360° views are possible. The tower is 3,537 feet above sea level. Altogether the distance from the visitor's parking area to the tower is 2.14 miles.
Trail #5 (""Las Cuarenta"").
Trail #5 is about 0.9 mile long and is a medium challenge trail. There is a significant amount of mud on this trail, but less so in the dry season months of December through March and June through July. To reach this trail from the visitor's parking area hikers must first head northbound to trek the entire length of Trail #7 (the Camping Area trail, 0.1 mile long), cross the bridge over the Doña Juana Creek and then hop on Trail #8. From this point on Trail #8, hikers head West for about 0.2 mile where Trail #5 begins; its entrance is located on the right hand side. The trail heads North and leads to Puerto Rico Highway 564. The first segment of the trail runs downhill for 0.9 mile. The trail runs a thick tropical jungle of banana trees, sierra palms, tree ferns, flamboyant trees, and elephant ears. The trail is muddy, steep, and scantily-marked. Visibility is minimal through the dense foliage. There are several creeks near this trail and birds are abundant: Black-throated Blue Warblers, Northern Parulas, Green Mangos, Cape May Warblers, Belted Kingfishers, among others. After the 0.9 mile trek, the trail reaches PR-564. There is water pumping station on the left. From this point the "trail" turns right, as PR-564 is intended to be part of the trail. Hikers walk South on PR-564 for 0.6 mile where the northern terminus of Trail #9 (the Doña Petra trail) is located to the right. Continuing southbound on PR-564 for another 0.1 mile, the road trail meets PR-143, where hikers turn right to continue South on Trail #5. From this point hikers walk another 0.25 mile to arrive at the visitor's parking area on the right side of the road. Considering the hikes on Trails #7 and #8 plus the hikes on roads PR-564 and PR-143, Trail #5 is 2.95 miles long, making it the second longest hike of all of Toro Negro's trails.
Trail #6 (The Pool).
This trail is about 0.5 miles long and a low challenge trail. The trail is well maintained, but the natural pool that it leads to is open during summer months only. Starting from the visitor's parking area, hikers get on PR-143 walking northeast bound (that is, making a left from the parking area to head "East" on PR-143) about 0.25 miles, then make a right into the forest at the sign (""Verada #6 - Piscina"") to get on Trail #6. This trail runs along a river for about 1/4 mile before it comes to the sign "Piscina" pointing left. Continuing south on the trail, there are two eye-catching waterfalls visible from the trail. Continuing southbound and uphill, the trail goes through two flat and open areas with picnic tables. After this, the trail continues uphill and southbound for about 0.6 miles where it comes to its end, reaching Trail #1. Once at Trail #1, hikers either make a left or a right to get onto Trail #1 (trail #1 is a loop trail) or, of course, may turn around to return to the parking area via Trail #6. The entire length of Trail #6 is 0.8 miles.
Trail #7 (Camping Area).
This trail is actually a paved forest road leading to the "Los Viveros" camping area, Toro Negro State Forest's only campground. It is located north of the parking area. The "trail" is only 0.1 mile long, wide and flat, thus a low challenge trail. The trail is also the connecting trail to Trail #8, which leads to "Charco La Confesora" (see below). Another use of this trail is that it leads to one of the forest's three official picnic areas. Its picnic area is the one closes to the visitor's parking area. The Doña Juana Creek runs next to the picnic area.
Trail #8 (""Charco La Confesora"").
This trail is 0.54 mile long, it is a medium challenge trail, and leads to "El Charco" ("The Pond"), a natural swimming hole. It is located north of the parking area, and starts at the end of Trail #7. After hiking north from the parking area on Trail #7 (Trail #7 is a 0.1 mile long paved road), and hiking by the camping area, Trail #7 comes to an end at the Doña Juana Creek. There is a sign pointing West ("Charco Confesora") near the picnic area next to the camping area that serves as a landmark. At this point hikers walk over a little bridge to cross the creek, where Trail #8 begins. The trail heads northwest along the creek (the creek is located to the left of the trail) and the trail is abundant with wild flowers. It is a downhill trail and a bit muddy. A section of the trail consists of concrete steps. At the end of the trail is Charco La Confesora, a natural "pool", with a waterfall as a backdrop. swimming is allowed at this "charco". The return path is the same as the path to the "charco" as the trail terminates at the "charco".
Trail #9 (""Doña Petra"").
This trail is 0.4 mile long, it is a medium challenge trail. Like Trail #5, it is located north of the parking area, and starts where Trail #7 end. Also, like trail #5, there is a significant amount of mud on this trail, though less so during the dry season months of December through March and June through July. To reach this trail from the visitor's parking area hikers must first head northbound to trek the entire length of Trail #7 (the Camping Area trail, 0.1 mile long) and cross the bridge over the Doña Juana Creek. Trail #9 begins at this bridge. Heading to the left from the bridge is the path for Trail #8, but heading straight up (northbound) gets hikers onto Trail #9, the Doña Petra Trail. (Like trail #5, the ""Las Cuarenta"" trail, Trail #9 will also bring the hiker to State Route PR-564, but being a shorter trail, it does not encounter PR-564 as far north as Trail #5 does.) The first segment of the trail runs downhill for 0.2 mile, where according to ranger office maps, there used to be a trail to the left (i.e., westbound) leading to Trail #5. However, vegetation apparently overran such connecting trail because it is no longer visible. The trail then continues another 0.2 mile where it reaches PR-564. From this point the "trail" turns right, as PR-564 is intended to be part of the trail. Hikers walk South on PR-564 for 0.1 mile where the "road trail" meets PR-143. At State Route PR-143 hikers turn right to continue South on Trail #9. From this point hikers walk another 0.25 mile to arrive at the visitor's parking area on the right side of the road. Considering the hikes on Trail #7 and roads PR-564 and PR-143, Trail #9 is 0.75 mile long.
Trails #2, #4, and #10.
Trails #2, #4 and #10 are no longer active trails. Trail #2 was called "Camino Ortolaza" and was 0.5 mile long. It was a "one-way" trail (i.e., same entrance and exit) and ran from PR-143 to the Doña Juana Creek. It started on PR-143 some 0.25 mile west of the entrance to the Area Recreativa/Visitor's parking area and headed North ending at the Doña Juana Creek, about 0.2 mile west of "Charco La Confesora". Trail #4 was called "Camino Vega Grande" and was 0.4 mile long. It was another "one-way" trail and began on PR-143 about 0.1 mile east of the current Trail #1 eastern terminus. Trail #10 was called "Camino El Tabonuco" and was about 0.2 mile long. It was also a "one-way" trail. It originated at km 32.3 on PR-143 and headed north into the forest.
Trail #11 (T9-to-T5 Connector).
An unnamed trail, but referenced and marked in the DRNA maps, is a trail that could be termed Trail #11 for referential purposes. It was located midway on Trail #9 (that is, about 0.2 mile west of PR-546) and headed north to Trail #5. It met Trail #9 at a point about 0.2 mile west of PR-546. This trail was about 0.3 mile long. It served the double purpose of acting as a nature trail while at the same time it connected Trails 5 and 9, thus making for a shortcut from Trail #5 back to the car parking area via Trail #9. DRNA considers this unnamed trail a part of (an offshoot of) Trail #5.
Campgrounds.
The campgrounds (camping area) at Toro Negro is called "Los Viveros." It is located on PR-143, Km 32.5. Its coordinates are at 18.17502°N, 66.49202°W (). Camping is available for a maximum of 35 people. Camping facilities include restrooms and showers. A permit is required for camping and they are purchased in advance, as there are no permit sales on premises. In the proximity of the campgrounds there is also a picnic area. It has six picnic shelters with covered BBQ, on-site water, and a spot for a campfire.
Lakes and water sports.
Lake El Guineo and Lake Matrullas are both man-made reservoirs. Fishing, boating and kayaking is allowed at the El Guineo and Matrullas reservoirs. Lake El Guineo is located at 18.1579°N 66.5284°W (), at an altitude of 3,002 feet above sea level. It is located between the municipalities of Ciales and Orocovis, west of the Doña Juana Recreation Area, on PR-143 at km 25.4. The lowest temperatures recorded on the Puerto Rico—some 40°F (4°C) -- were measured at Lake Guineo. Lake Matrullas is located at 18.2064°N 66.4798°W (), at an altitude of 2,464 feet above sea level. It too is between the municipalities of Ciales and Orocovis. It is located northeast of the Doña Juana Recreation Area, on PR-564 at km 6.1. The Puerto Rico DRNA allows the use of kayaks in Lake Matrullas. The ambiance is cool and misty. Both lakes are all well stocked with Peacock and Largemouth bass. Creeks are abundant in the area, and in addition to the Quebrada Doña Juana, the forest also has a number of other creeks, such as Quebrada Rosa.
Observation tower.
The observation tower, accessible only on foot via Trail #3, rises at 3,537 feet above sea level, making it the highest manmade point on the island. The observation tower sits atop Cerro Doña Juana, Puerto Rico's 11th highest peak at above sea level. The tower's coordinates are 18.17178°N, 66.48091°W (). The tower is used for observation of the landscape surrounding Toro Negro and, on clear mornings before the afternoon clouds roll in, both the northern and southern shores of Puerto Rico are visible. San Juan is also visible as a distant haze in the northeastern horizon. The observation tower affords views Lake El Guineo and Lake Guayabal as well as the Caribbean Sea. It was built by the Spaniards during colonial times as a lookout tower to protect the south coast of the Island.
"Charcos".
Charcos are natural ponds, or swimming holes, formed by the mountain rivers as they fall as waterfalls onto the ground below. They are popular way of refreshing from the summer heat in the Toro Negro State Forest. The forest's "official" pool is accessed via Trail number 6, the "La Piscina" ("The Pool") trail. To reach trail 6, hikers start out from the forest office/parking area and hike north on route PR-143 about 1/4 mile. Trail 6 is located on the right hand side of the road. This pool is a river-fed pool. It was deteriorated, in disrepair and closed to public use sometime prior to 2010 and, in February 2013, there were unconfirmed reports that it had been repaired and reopen. In 2008, it was reported that an agreement between DNRA and the local community had been signed whereby the community would help repair the pool. In any case, this pool opens only during the summer months. The pool's water temperature is very chilled, but refreshing given the high humidity of the area, particularly in the afternoons. La Piscina is located at 18.1713°N 66.4876°W ().
A second river-fed swimming pool "charco" is located at "Charco La Confesora". It is about 15 x 25 feet large and deep enough to dive feet first. This "charco" is accessed via Trail number 8, located at the end of Trail 7, the trail to the camping area. The pool at "Charco La Confesora" is located at 18.176901, -66.495861. ().
Cerro de Punta and other peaks.
The forest includes Puerto Rico's highest peak, Cerro de Punta, which is located at km. 17.0 on Puerto Rico Highway 143. It is at 18.1722°N, 66.5917°W (). The mountain is the dividing landmark for the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya. The mountain is accessible by car but the road is quite steep and many prefer to walk the road (it is about half hour's hike to the top) unless riding on an all-wheel drive vehicle. There is parking on PR-143 for those who prefer to walk to the hilltop. Another peak in the Toro Negro is Cerro Maravilla, infamous due to the murders of two independentistas youth at the hand of police in an ambush. This peak is also accessible by car from PR-143. The road leading to the top of Cerro Maravilla is PR-577 and is not as steep as that to Cerro de Punta (the Cerro de Punta road has no state signing.) This road is also much shorter, about 0.5 kilometer total length. Cerro Maravilla is located at 18.1532°N, 66.5543°W (). Communications towers for radio, television, cellular and similar systems are located atop each of these peaks and armed security personnel, including police, is on the premises. However, private individuals can access both of these peaks. Overall, the Forest contains Cerro Punta, Cerro Rosa and Cerro Jayuya, which are considered to be Puerto Rico's three highest peaks. Cerro Maravilla, Cerro El Bolo, and Cerro Doña Juana are also located within the Toro Negro Forest.
Nearby attractions.
Doña Juana Falls.
These falls (Spanish: Salto de Doña Juana) are about 200 feet tall. They are not located within the Toro Negro State Forest itself but they are near it, requiring visitors to drive 3.9 km westbound on route PR-143 from the Doña Juana Recreational Area to reach PR-149, then drive an additional 2.3 kilometers northbound on PR-149 (towards Ciales). The falls are on PR-149 at km 41.3. They are the tallest waterfalls in Puerto Rico. Their coordinates are 18.182836, -66.512257. ().
The falls are part of the Doña Juana Creek as it runs into Rio Toro Negro at the line that divides the municipalities of Ciales and Orocovis. The falls are very accessible, as they are viewable from the road as drivers cross the bridge of these falls. The falls fall next to the road on its eastern side and then run under the PR-149 bridge, to feed into Rio Toro Negro located a few yards on the western side of PR-149.
Villalba-Orocovis Lookout.
This lookout position (known in Spanish as the "Mirador Villalba-Orocovis" or the Villalba-Orocovis Lookout) is located outside the Toro Negro State Forest but still on PR-143 (km 39.8) and a short distance from the forest, and it is a popular stop over for visitors to the forest. It contains picnic areas, restroom facilities and various trails. It is located at 18°10'37"N, 66°27'0"W, that is, 7.4 kilometers east of Toro Negro State Forest's Doña Juana Recreational Area.
Climate.
The Toro Negro State Forest is located in the cool, moist mountains of the Cordillera Central. Mean annual temperature from 19.4 to 25 °C. Temperatures are unmistakably cooler at higher elevations. Average yearly temperature is 18.4°C (65.12°F).
Average annual precipitation of five weather stations in and surrounding the forest ranges from 203 to 292 cm. As much as 150 inches of annual rainfall has registered at Toro Negro. The average annual rainfall is 110 inches. The months of September and May experience the most precipitation. A dry season runs from December through March. The months of June and July also tend to be dry.

Þursaflokkurinn

Þursaflokkurinn (en: the hobgoblins), often written in a simplified way ("Thursaflokkurinn"), is an Icelandic progressive rock group that was mainly active in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Similar to the Dutch band Focus Þursaflokkurinn combined rock music with influences of classical music and jazz, enhancing their sound by adding elements of Scandinavian folk music and sometimes eccentric vocals resembling the Rock in Opposition work of, for instance, the Swedish band Samla Mammas Manna.
Since their foundation in Reykjavík in the year of 1978 the group consisted of Egill Ólafsson (vocals, keyboards) and acoustic guitar, guitarist Þórður Arnason, bassoonist Rúnar Vilbergsson, bassist Tómas Magnus Tómasson and drummer Ásgeir Óskarsson.
Between 1978 und 1980 the band mainly played progressive rock with influences of folk, psychedelic and jazz rock. 
Most of the songs are based on Icelandic folk songs; especially the debut album includes many traditional folk tunes which all have been turned into a progressive rock arrangement. 
The second album Þursabit has more psychedelic influences than the 'folkier' debut album and also features more prominent keyboards, for example the Hammond organ (played by the newly recruited keyboarder Karl Sighvatsson) and the electric piano.
The band's 1980 tour is documented by a live album, Á hljómleikum and imports jazz influences into the band's music. Quite striking is a punk rock track at the end of the album which became a popular and well-known song in Iceland.
The fourth album of the band Gæti eins verið... from the year of 1982 showed a completely new style, the new wave music. The acoustic instruments were nearly completely substituted by synthesizers; keyboarder Karl Sighvattson and bassoonist Rúnar Vilbergsson had left the band. 
After some records for a new album in 1983 and 1984 the band split. One reason was the fact that the band's success did not progress to other countries than Iceland. Egill Ólafsson started working as a writer and was a member in the band "Stuðmenn" in which other Þursaflokkurinn musicians were also playing. 
Sometimes the band met again for one-off-performances, for example for the memorial for Karl Sighvattson who died in 1991. 
For their 30th anniversary in February 2008 all the albums were reissued in a mini-vinyl-box with a CD full of previously unissued tracks and live versions. In addition there is a tour going through Iceland since early 2008 with the small orchestra "Capút"; a live CD/DVD has been issued in late November 2008 with the title "Hinn íslenski Þursaflokkur og Caput".

Terrence Cody

Terrence Bernard Cody, Jr. (born June 28, 1988) is an American football nose tackle for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Alabama, where he was given the nickname "Mount Cody" for his 360-pound frame. He was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the second round of the 2010 NFL Draft.
A native of Florida, Cody spent two seasons at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, where he helped the Bulldogs to an unbeaten season in 2007. Surprisingly nimble even at a peak weight of more than , Cody drew the attention of major Division I programs. He finished his collegiate career at Alabama, where he earned consensus All-American honors twice while anchoring one of college football's best defenses during the 2008 and 2009 seasons. During his senior season with the Alabama Crimson Tide in 2009, he helped lead the Tide to an undefeated 14–0 season including a victory in the 2010 BCS National Championship Game.
Early years.
Cody was born in Fort Myers, Florida. As a child, he wore size-10 shoes by the age of eight and was never eligible for the Pop Warner youth leagues because he was always over the weight limit. He attended Riverdale High School in Fort Myers. Already and as a ninth-grader, Cody began playing high school football and displayed a high degree of athleticism, causing his high school coach, Scott Jones, to predict "he could be making $2 million playing in the NFL" at some point. He played only two years of varsity football: as a freshman and then as a senior. He struggled academically, had to help take care of his seven younger siblings, and ended up “running with the wrong crowd”.
After sitting out his sophomore and junior seasons, Cody dominated as a senior. In a game against North Fort Myers, he had a memorable collision with star running back Noel Devine. “Terrence hit and spun Noel Devine so hard that was on the sideline puking,” coach Jones said.
Cody was not ranked among the nation's elite football prospects in 2006 by any recruiting service. Nonetheless he was offered athletic scholarships by the University of Miami and the University of South Florida, but could not qualify academically. Cody eventually signed with Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College.
College career.
Mississippi Gulf Coast.
Cody played two seasons at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in Perkinston, Mississippi as a nose tackle. As a freshman he recorded 48 tackles with 2.5 sacks and an interception. In his sophomore year, he added 31 tackles and 3.5 sacks while anchoring a Bulldog defense that ranked number one in the state in rushing defense and total defense. Mississippi Gulf Coast finished the season with an 12–0 season record and a NJCAA Co-National Championship. Cody was named to the NJCAA All-American first team. He also earned a three-star rating by "Rivals.com" and was listed as the 47th-best junior college player in the country.
Despite his dominance, he had trouble drawing scholarship offers, as his weight of scared off many teams. “A lot of people are just wary of guys that big,” Mississippi Gulf Coast coach Steve Campbell said. “You know when people say that if things seem too good to be true that they usually are. A big guy like that who's that athletic, you just don't believe what you're seeing.” Particularly noted for his lower body strength, Cody had a squat max of in junior college.
However, after Cody had his weight down to , a number of schools offered him scholarships, including Tennessee, Ole Miss, and Florida State. He was heavily recruited particularly by Alabama Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban, who was in need of a true nose tackle for his 3–4 defense. Cody recalls Saban telling him, "We need a body like yours in the middle, to stop the run, to change the rhythm of the game." Cody committed to the Crimson Tide on November 29, 2007.
Alabama.
2008 season.
Cody made an immediate impact for the Crimson Tide defensive line, recording four tackles—one for loss—in a 34–10 rout of the Clemson Tigers. He and the rest of the defense also held the Tigers, which included running backs James Davis and C. J. Spiller, to zero net rushing yards. With his presence in the middle of the Crimson Tide defensive line, Cody earned himself the nickname of “Mount Cody.” By mid-season he was already considered the No. 1 nose tackle prospect for the 2009 NFL Draft by league scouts.
Against Arkansas, Cody dominated Razorbacks center Jonathan Luigs—the 2007 Rimington Trophy winner—and helped the Crimson Tide to a 49–14 win. In a memorable play on a fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line late in the first half, Cody blasted past Luigs and left guard Wade Grayson to grab running back Michael Smith before he could reach the end zone. In Alabama's rout over Georgia at Sanford Stadium, Cody was instrumental in holding Doak Walker award candidate Knowshon Moreno to just 34 yards rushing. In the seventh game of the season against Ole Miss, he received a knee injury during the third quarter which sidelined him for two weeks.
In the annual Iron Bowl versus rival Auburn, Cody and teammate Bobby Greenwood sacked quarterback Kodi Burns, giving Cody his first half-sack of the season. He also recovered a fumble, which set up an Alabama touchdown. In the 2008 SEC Championship Game versus Florida, Cody recorded three tackles in a 31–20 loss. In the loss, the Crimson Tide allowed 142 yards rushing—the second most in the 2008 season. In the season finale, he recorded one assisted tackle, while holding the Utah Utes to 13 yards rushing. However, Alabama went on to lose the game 31–17, finishing the season 12–2.
Alabama′s rush defense considerably improved in 2008. After giving up 128.4 rushing yards a game in 2007, the Crimson Tide only allowed 78.8 yards per game in 2008. “As far as one guy who has changed our team more than any, you’d have to go with Terrence,” offensive lineman Mike Johnson said. Cody was subsequently given the team’s Defensive Achievement Award for a newcomer who has played a critical role in the effectiveness of his unit.
Despite being commonly regarded as a top prospect, Cody decided to skip the 2009 NFL Draft. On Christmas Day 2008 an "announcement" on his Facebook page said that he was leaving early, but turned out to be a joke by his girlfriend.
2009 season.
Prior to the 2009 season Cody dropped about 10 pounds and worked on his conditioning, hoping to keep himself in the game on third-down passing situations. He was often replaced by Josh Chapman on passing downs in 2008. Nick Saban stated Cody needed to reduce his weight to in order to become an every-down player and pass-rusher; he reported for fall practice at , set a goal to reach by the season opener, and eventually dropped his weight to . Only a couple of days before the first game, Cody and a few of his teammates were sidelined with flu-like symptoms. Cody returned after a three-day absence.
Cody was named to the 2009 Lombardi Award, Lott Trophy, and Outland Trophy pre-season watch lists. "Rivals.com" ranked him as the No. 1 defensive tackle in college football in 2009. On October 14, 2009, Cody and teammate Rolando McClain were announced as two of the twelve finalists for the 2009 Lombardi Award. Cody was also named to "The Sporting News" and "CBS Sports" midseason college football All-American teams.
In a game against Tennessee on October 24, Cody blocked his first two field goals of his career, including a 44-yard attempt in the game's final seconds, to secure Alabama's 12–10 win. According to "Yahoo! Sports"' national columnist Dan Wetzel, Cody earned himself Heisman Trophy consideration with his performance against the Volunteers. A couple of weeks later, Mike Hiserman of the "Los Angeles Times" also called for Heisman consideration for Cody, describing him as "the best player on what might be college football's top defense."
On November 10, Cody was named one of four finalists for the Lombardi Award, alongside Jerry Hughes, Gerald McCoy, and Ndamukong Suh. He was the seventh Crimson Tide player to be named a finalist and the second in a row, joining offensive tackle Andre Smith, who was a finalist for the award in 2008. Former All-American linebacker Cornelius Bennett was the only Alabama player to win the Lombardi Award, capturing the honor in 1986. In the end, Nebraska's Ndamukong Suh won the award. On November 19, Cody joined Pat Angerer, Eric Berry, Jerry Hughes, and Ndamukong Suh as the five finalists for the 2009 Nagurski Trophy, but was again beat out by Suh for the award. On November 23, Cody, Brandon Spikes and Suh were announced as the three finalists for the 2009 Bednarik Award, which was eventually won by Suh as well.
In his two seasons at Alabama, Cody helped the Crimson Tide to lead the Southeastern Conference in rushing defense, allowing opponents a rushing average of only 78.8 and 78.1 yards per game in 2008 and 2009, respectively. No individual player reached the 100-yard rushing mark against the Crimson Tide in those two seasons; Anthony Dixon of Mississippi State came closest with 81 yards in 2009. Cody's presence improved Alabama's pass rush despite his not being an effective pass rusher himself. Wrote Michael Casagrande: "The power that comes with his size typically forces opposing lines to focus two players on blocking him, thus creating favorable rushing lanes for unblocked linebackers."
Prior to the 2010 BCS National Championship Game, Cody drew awestruck praise from Texas players and coaches. "They call him Mount Cody. Mount Cody is for a reason. He plays like he’s 450 pounds. He can move like he’s Sergio Kindle," said Longhorns guard Charlie Tanner. Alabama's defense held Texas to 81 yards rushing—more than 70 yards below their season average—on 28 attempts, and helped the Crimson Tide to their first national title since 1992.
Along with Crimson Tide teammates Javier Arenas, Mike Johnson, Leigh Tiffin, and Colin Peek, Cody participated in the 2010 Senior Bowl on January 30, 2010. In the Senior Bowl weigh-in at the Mobile Convention Center, Cody tipped the scales at 370 pounds, which hurt his draft status according to NFL Network draft analyst Mike Mayock.
Professional career.
2010 NFL Draft.
Frequently drawing comparisons to Ted Washington and Shaun Rogers, Cody was considered one of the rare two-gap nose tackles that NFL teams covet for their 3–4 defenses. Many NFL experts therefore projected Cody to be selected in the first-round of the 2010 NFL Draft. One of the teams interested in Cody was rumored to be his near-hometown Miami Dolphins, who lost their veteran nose tackle Jason Ferguson to injury during the 2009 season.
Some pro scouts, however, were concerned about Cody's weight and said he needed to reduce it to in order to be an effective NFL player. They questioned whether he had the stamina to be a three-down player, or the quickness to be an effective pass rusher, at his college weight of about . "ESPN′s" K. C. Joyner analyzed Cody's relative playing time in a four-game SEC stretch in October 2009 (at Kentucky, at Mississippi, vs. South Carolina, vs. Tennessee), and found that Cody was in the Alabama defensive lineup on only 122 of 281 plays. Joyner also discovered that during that stretch Cody drew an impressively high amount of double-teams: 63.6 percent, compared to NFL player Albert Haynesworth's 2007 double-team mark of 51.3 percent.
At the 2010 Senior Bowl, Cody disappointed a lot of NFL scouts when he weighed in at , above his official weight according to the 2009 Alabama media guide. In the game, however, Cody "moved pretty well for a 370-pound behemoth" and used "his hands well to create a little space to get penetration". He finished with 1.5 tackles for loss. Cody worked out at API in Pensacola, Florida, along with Sam Bradford, Jason Worilds, and former Alabama teammates Mike Johnson and Roy Upchurch. He made pre-draft visits to the Baltimore Ravens, the New York Jets, the San Diego Chargers, and the Kansas City Chiefs.
At the NFL Combine, Cody weighed in at , making him the heaviest combine participant since Aaron Gibson in 1999. He had managed to shed some weight since the Senior Bowl, but according to Mike Mayock he was still not worthy of a first-round pick. Cody ran a 5.62 sec 40-yard dash, the slowest by an eventually drafted defensive tackle since Corey Swinson, a seventh round pick in the 1995 NFL Draft. Cody was selected in the 2nd round (57th overall) by the Baltimore Ravens. He was the highest picked Alabama Crimson Tide defensive tackle since Cornelius Griffin was drafted 42nd overall by the New York Giants in the 2000 NFL Draft.
Baltimore Ravens.
At Baltimore, Cody was projected to strengthen a Ravens defense that allowed the fewest rushing yards per carry (3.4) of any NFL team in and had a streak of 39 consecutive games without allowing a 100-yard rusher—broken when Cincinnati's Cedric Benson rushed for 120 yards on October 11, 2009. Regarded by Ravens director of player personnel Eric DeCosta as a first-round prospect "from an ability standpoint," Cody was expected to compete against Kelly Gregg for the starting nose tackle spot in . The combination of Cody and 345-pound Haloti Ngata gave Baltimore the AFC North’s heaviest interior line, reminiscent of Sam Adams and Tony Siragusa on the 2000–2001 Ravens teams.
Cody signed a four-year, $3.385 million maximum value contract with the Ravens on July 26, 2010. In training camp at McDaniel College, Cody—along with veteran cornerback Walt Harris—failed his conditioning test for the Ravens, and was thus placed on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list. He eventually passed the conditioning test on his third try, allowing him to go to training camp for the Ravens.
In his unofficial NFL debut, a preseason game against the Carolina Panthers, Cody had a solid performance, finishing with five tackles (four solo). His most impressive play came in the first half, when he tackled DeAngelo Williams with one arm for a loss while holding off Panthers center Ryan Kalil with the other. On November 21, he made his first official start, debuting against the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium. Unlike his preseason performance, he was criticized for his poor performance from fans and head coach John Harbaugh. During a play, the Panthers offensive lineman pushed Cody out of the way, allowing Mike Goodson to have a 45-yard run. Cody finished the game without any tackles, as the Ravens defense allowed 120 rushing yards.
Later in the 2010 season, and especially in the playoffs, he stepped up his play though. So much so, in fact, that in the 2011 off-season, the team parted ways with their long-time starting nose tackle Kelly Gregg. Cody spent the entire 2011 season as a full-time starter, registering 34 tackles and helping lead the Ravens defense to be ranked 2nd in the league against the run, ranked 3rd overall.
Personal.
By his own description of his early family life, Cody grew up poor. His mother worked two jobs, as a traveling nurse and a bus driver, to care for him and his seven younger siblings. His parents were not married, but his father, a construction worker, was a big part of his life until he died in a car accident when Cody was 11. At the end of his junior year of high school, Cody moved in with the family of a high school teammate, Jason Milliken.
In his two years at Alabama, Cody became the Tide's most popular player because of his outsized personality and body. Says quarterback Greg McElroy: "He's an enjoyable person to have on our team, have in the locker room, and (he) has great charisma. He has fun when he plays the game, and that's a big reason why he's so popular."

Havmanden-class submarine (1911)

The "Havmanden" class was a class of six submarines built for the Royal Danish Navy from 1911 to 1914. Also later known as the A class, the boats were designed by the Austro-Hungarian firm Whitehead & Co. of Fiume. The first three submarines were built by the company, while the remaining three were constructed under license in Copenhagen.
The boats were just over long and their armament consisted of two bow torpedo tubes, later supplemented with an machine gun. The boats had a single shaft and were propelled by a Fiat or M.A.N. diesel engine on the surface and two electric motors while submerged.
Although there was at least one close call for the class leader during World War I, none of the six boats was sunk in service. All six boats of the class remained active in the Royal Danish Navy from their time of construction until 1928, when the first two boats were stricken. The remaining boats were all stricken by 1932. The "Havmanden" class served as the basis for the Austro-Hungarian Navy's s built during World War I.

After taking delivery of its first submarine—the problematic , built at La Spezia by Fiat-Laurenti in 1909—the Royal Danish Navy looked for a submarine design that could be built in Denmark. In 1910, the Navy contracted with Whitehead & Co. of Fiume for the class' namesake boat, , to be built by Whitehead, and plans for a second, , to be built at the Copenhagen Navy Yard. In May 1911, while the first two were still under construction, the Navy ordered two more boats from Whitehead, and , and plans for a final two, and . 
The "Havmanden"-class boats were submarines that displaced surfaced and submerged. The boats were long with a beam of and a draft of . For propulsion, they featured a single shaft, a single Fiat or M.A.N. diesel engine for surface running, and twin electric motors for submerged travel. The diesels of the Whitehead boats were rated at , while the Copenhagen boats were .
The boats were equipped with two bow torpedo tubes of , but had no deck guns. In 1917, all were outfitted with a single machine gun. The complement of the boats as built was ten men, but was later increased to fourteen. 
In December 1911, "Havmanden" became the first boat of the class to be launched, with "Havfruen" and "Thetis" following in 1912. "Triton" and "Najaden" were launched in 1913, while "Nymfen", the final ship constructed, was launched in February 1914.
After the outbreak of World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Navy seized plans for the "Havmanden" boats from Whitehead & Co. and used them as the basis for its four s.
Service careers.
Initially "Havfruen", "Havmanden", and "Thetis" received pennant numbers of "H 1", "H 2", and "T 1", respectively, but were changed to "2", "3", and "4" in April 1913. The other three submarines—"2den April" (the newly renamed "Triton"), "Najaden", and "Nymfen"—received pennant numbers "5", "6", and "7" at the same time.
Sources do not report when any of the "Havmanden" boats were commissioned, but all boats were active for neutral Denmark during World War I. "Havmanden" had a narrow escape in September 1914 when a British submarine mistook her for a German U-boat and launched an unsuccessful torpedo attack on her.
Late in their careers, the class was identified as the A class and the pennant numbers of all the submarines were prefixed with an "A", becoming "A-2" to "A-7". None of the boats, however, ever displayed an "A" on their conning towers. "Havmanden" and "Thetis" were the first two boats taken out of service when they were stricken in April 1928. "Havfruen" was the last boat removed from service when she was stricken in May 1932.
Class members.
There were six submarines that were members of the "Havmanden" or A class.
"Havfruen" (A 2).
The plans for "Havfruen" were purchased in 1910 and the boat was built at the Copenhagen Navy Yard. She was launched on 31 August 1912. She initially received the pennant number of "H 1", but was assigned the number "2" in April 1913. She was later designated "A 2" when the class became known as the "A class" late in her career. "Havfruen" was the last ship of the class to be removed from service when she was stricken on 3 May 1932.
"Havmanden" (A 3).
"Havmanden" was ordered in 1910 from Whitehead & Co. in Fiume. She was launched on 23 December 1911. She initially received the pennant number of "H 2", but was assigned the number "3" in April 1913. In September 1914, "Havmanden", displaying her pennant number of "3" on her conning tower, was mistaken for the German U-boat by the British submarine , but "Havmanden" escaped without damage when "E11"s torpedo missed its mark. "Havmanden" was designated "A 3" when the class became known as the "A class" later in her career. Along with "Thetis", she was one of the first two boats of the class removed from service when stricken on 26 April 1928.
"Thetis" (A 4).
"Thetis" was ordered in May 1911 from Whitehead & Co. in Fiume. She was launched on 19 June 1912. She initially received the pennant number of "T 1", but was assigned the number "4" in April 1913. "Thetis" was designated "A 4" when the class became known as the "A class" later in her career. She and "Havmanden" were stricken on 26 April 1928, the first two boats of the class to be removed from service.
"2den April" (A 5).
"Triton" was ordered in May 1911 from Whitehead & Co. in Fiume. She was launched on 31 March 1913. Her purchase was financed by a subscription offer made by the public and, as a result, she had been renamed "2den April"—in honor of the first Battle of Copenhagen, fought on 2 April 1801—by the time she was assigned the pennant number "5" in April 1913. She was designated "A 5" when the class became known as the "A class" later in her career. After "2den April" was stricken on 15 January 1929, she was used as a target and ultimately broken up in 1932.
"Najaden" (A 6).
The plans for "Najaden" were purchased in May 1911 and the boat was built at the Copenhagen Navy Yard. She was launched on 9 July 1913. She was assigned the pennant number of "6" in April 1913. She was designated "A 6" when the class became known as the "A class" later in her career and was stricken on 9 September 1931.
"Nymfen" (A 7).
The plans for "Nymfen" were purchased in May 1911 and the boat was built at the Copenhagen Navy Yard. She was launched on 10 February 1914, and was the final ship of the class launched. She was assigned the pennant number of "7" in April 1913, but designated "A 7" when the class became known as the "A class" later in her career. "Nymfen" was stricken on 11 March 1932.

Arclinea

Arclinea, also known as "Arclinea Arredamenti Spa", is an Italian design company. It was founded in Caldogno, Italy in 1925 by Silvio Fortuna, as a carpentry shop. The company began to focus exclusively on kitchen cabinetry in 1960. At that point, the firm began crafting cabinetry specifically designed to hold appliances, which had typically been considered a separate kitchen design element. This led to a more sleek, streamlined appearance for the kitchen.
The company successfully introduced several modular kitchen designs into the marketplace during the 1960s and 1970s, working with a variety of European designers. In 1987, Arclinea partnered exclusively with Italian architect Antonio Citterio, who has remained the sole designer for the firm, designing and coordinating its six kitchen models: Italia, Mediterranea, Florida, Artusi, Convivium, and Lignum et Lapis, which was introduced at the 2008 Eurocucina Fair in Milan.
Since that time, Arclinea has been recognized with numerous awards, including Italy's highest design award, the Compasso d'Oro, and the 2004 "Elle Decor" Designer of the Year Award. Arclinea has also expanded beyond Italy, with locations in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North and South America. Its first standalone U.S. showroom opened in Boston in 2001, although the product was previously sold in Chicago. Today, Silvio Fortuna's grandson, also named Silvio Fortuna, is the chairman of the company.

Ascot-Pullin Motorcycles was a British motorcycle manufacturer founded by Cyril Pullin as the Ascot Motor and Manufacture Co Ltd at Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1928. An inventor and winner of the 1914 Isle of Man TT, Pullin had been developing ideas for motorcycle designs since 1920 with Stanley Groom, and had patented a two-stroke engine motorcycle with pressed sheet metal frame and forks. After leaving Douglas the first time, Pullin worked with Groom again to refine his ideas and develop and patent the Ascot-Pullin motorcycle. Less than 500 were built and sales were poor, resulting in the company's liquidation in 1930.
Ascot-Pullin 500.
Pullin was an innovator and the Ascot-Pullin 500 ohv single had the engine horizontally mounted and enclosed with a pressed-steel frame. As well as the first use of hydraulic brakes on a motorcycle, Pullin also designed a telescopic centre stand and an adjustable windshield with a windscreen wiper and rear-view mirror, as well as a fully enclosed chain and interchangeable wheels.
Powerwheel.
The Ascot-Pullin name was revived in 1951 by for the Hercules Cycle and Motor Company, a
division of Tube Investments, who commissioned Pullin's new invention, the "Powerwheel", a , , single-cylinder rotary engine. The prototypes were scrapped after the company decided not to proceed with production, but a sectionalised example survived together with most of the drawings, and an industrialised version was developed for the Ministry of Supply.

Following the failure of their previous album and follow-up singles, the group was dropped by Epic Records. The Dooleys set up their own label," R 'n' R Records", and recorded this album with a new female vocalist, Vicki Roe. The first single released was "Flavour of the Month" in September 1983, but failed to chart in the UK and forced them to shelve the album. The album did get a release in Japan, however, where the group had enjoyed two earlier No.1 singles, along with the release of the title track as a single. Neither charted in Japan and this effectively marked the end of The Dooleys as a recording act. 
The Dooleys continued touring and released a limited edition 12" single, "New Beginning", under the name "Force 8", but this failed to attract any attention. The song itself became a big hit for Bucks Fizz in 1986 however. That same year, "Flavour of the Month" was belatedly released as a single in Ireland, where Vicki Roe was originally from.

Delhi Transco Limited

Delhi Transco Limited is the State Transmission Utility for the National Capital Territory of Delhi. It is responsible for the transmission of power at 220 kV and 400 kV level and for upgrading, operating and maintaining the high voltage network.
History of Electricity in Delhi.
The position is that as per available records, the first diesel Power Station was established in Delhi in the year 1905 when a private English Company by name M/s. John Fleming was given permission to generate electricity under the provisions of the Indian Electricity Act 1903. The above mentioned Company was given the responsibility both of generation and distribution of power in a limited manner. That Company after obtaining license under the provisions of Electricity Act 1903 had set up a small 2 MW Diesel set at Lahori Gate in Old Delhi. Later on, this very Company was converted as Delhi Electricity Supply and Traction Company. In the Year 1911, the power generation was augmented by Steam Generation Station. In the year 1932, the management of Central Power House was handed over to New Delhi Municipal Committee (NDMC). In the field of power generation and distribution, a major break through was achieved in 1939 when Delhi Central Electricity Power Authority (DCEPA) was established. This Company was responsible for the supply of power to the areas covered by Local Bodies, namely, the Municipal Committees of Delhi, West Delhi and South Delhi, the Notified Area Committees of Red Fort, Civil Lines, Mehrauli, Najafgarh, and the District Board of Delhi. The supply of electricity to the Municipal Committees of Delhi-Shahdara and the Notified Area of Narela was done by different private agencies. In 1947 DCEPA took over a Private Limited Company by name Delhi electric Supply & traction Company Limited.
Formation of Delhi State Electricity Board (DSEB).
In the year 1951 the Delhi State Electricity Board (DSEB) came into existence and the responsibility of generation and distribution of electricity was taken over by DSEB from DCEPA.
Formation of Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking (DESU).
After the promulgation of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act 1957, the DSEB was dissolved and the functions of DSEB were taken over by Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking (DESU), which came into existence in 1958. After the formation DESU, the generation and distribution of electricity to all the areas of Delhi came under DESU.
Formation of Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB).
The Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi vide notification No. F.11 (10)/92-LSG /PF (II) dated 24.02.1997, issued under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, constituted a separate Electricity Board, i.e. the Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) for the NCT of Delhi w.e.f. 24.02.1997 for the purpose of generation and distribution of power to the entire area of NCT of Delhi except the areas falling within the jurisdiction of NDMC and Delhi Cantonment Board.
Unbundling of Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB).
The power situation in Delhi till a few year ago was yet another example of man’s incapacity to handle another form of energy. The Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) was a State Electricity Board set up in 1997 under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, succeeding the Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU) which has existed since 1957 as a wing of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. It was an integrated utility with generation, transmission and distribution functions serving all of Delhi except the NDMC and MES (Cantoment) areas to which it supplied power in bulk.
The creation of DVB, replacing DESU, is 1997 proved to be merely a change in the legal status of the organization and was not followed by any real change in its structure, functioning and work culture. Its reputation continued to deteriorate and its poor commercial performance, the best known thing about DVB perhaps being its high Transmission and Distribution (T&D) losses made it a drain on the public exchequer. Further, failure in raising the resources necessary for improvement of its services made matters critical. There were unprecedented, widespread expressions of public discontent during the difficult summer of 1998.
In December 1998 when the present Government came to power in Delhi, the power situation was grim to say the least. With T & D losses as high as 50% regular power cute for 10 to 15 hours and Delhi Vidyut Board accumulating liabilities of over Rs. 23,000 crores, Delhi Government had to come up with a fast and viable alternative. An alternative that would not only meet people’s aspirations in terms of its end result but also be interesting enough for investors. And thus began a step by step process of a never-before fundamental power reform.
Delhi Electricity Board Regulatory Commission (DERC) was constituted in May 1999 whose prime responsibility was to look into the entire gamut of existing activity and search for various ways of power sector reforms. The DERC is even today a fully functional body which has since issued tariff orders for annual revenue requirement.
Delhi Electricity Reform Ordinance, 2000 was a body which was promulgated in October 2000 and notified in the form of an Act in March 2001. It mainly provides for the constitution of an Electricity Regulatory Commission, unbundling of DVB into separate generation, transmission and distribution companies and increasing avenues for participation of private sector.
This was followed with a Tripartite Agreement which was signed by the Government of Delhi, DVB employees to ensure the cooperation of stakeholders in this reform process. The tripartite agreement sent off very positive vibes to the people in general as well as to the investor community about the sincere and hassle-free objectives of power reforms.
Next, a two stage competitive bidding process of Request for Qualification (RFQ) and Request for Proposal (RFP) was set into motion for privatization of the distribution companies.
The bidders were selected on the basis of reduction of total Aggregate Technical and Commercial of losses (AT & C) a unique feature of the power sector reforms in Delhi. The bidders were required to bid on the basis of efficiency improvement like reduction of AT & C losses that they achieve year wise over a period of five years.
Formation of Delhi Transco Limited (DTL).
On July 1, 2002,The Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) was unbundled into six successor companies: Delhi Power Supply Company Limited (DPCL)- Holding Company; Delhi Transco Limited (DTL) - TRANSCO; Indraprastha Power Generation Company Limited (IPGCL) - GENCO; BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) - DISCOM; BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) - DISCOM; North Delhi Power Limited (NDPL) - DISCOM. 
The Government handed over the management of the business of electricity distribution to three private companies BRPL, BYPL and NDPL since July 1, 2002 with 51% equity with the private sector.(DVB itself was the successor entity to the Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU).
Of these five companies, BRPL, BYPL and NDPL are joint ventures between the Delhi Government and the private sector which handle the power distribution sector in Delhi. BRPL is responsible for distribution of power in Central, South and West Delhi. BYPL handles power distribution in East Delhi (Trans-Yamuna). NDPL distributes power in North and North-West Delhi. The remaining two companies, DTL and IPGCL, are wholly owned by the Delhi Government. Delhi Transco Limited is a 'State Transmission Utility of the National Capital of Delhi', whereas IPGCL is responsible for power generation.
Over the years, DTL has evolved as a most dynamic performer, keeping pace with the many-fold challenges that confront the ever increasing demand-supply-power-situation and achieving functional superiority on all fronts. The Transmission losses have been brought down from 3.84% in 2002-03 to 0.83% in 2006-07, and are the lowest in the country. Delhi, being the capital of India and the hub of commercial activities in the Northern Region, coupled with the prosperity of population, the load requirement has been growing at a much faster pace. Added to that, being the focus of socio-economic and political life of India, Delhi is assuming increasing eminence among the great cities of the world. Plus the vision-2021, aiming to make Delhi a global Metropolitan and world class city demands greater infrastructure to enrich many services of infrastructure development.
DTL, has been responsibly playing its role in establishing, upgrading, operating and maintaining the EHV (Extra High Voltage) network. DTL has also been assigned the responsibility of running the State Load Dispatch Centre which is an apex body to ensure integrated operations of power systems in Delhi.

Power Arrangements of Delhi.
DTL had been arranging power from various sources for all the five distribution licensees since 1 July 2002. Keeping in mind the Commonwealth Games 2010 it had signed power purchase agreements for more than 9000 MW of power. This arrangement continued till 31 March 2007. From 1 April 2007 onwards all the distribution agencies are directly purchasing power and all the long and short term Power Purchase Agreements have been transferred to these agencies by Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) on the basis of their consumption. Now it is the responsibility of the distribution companies to arrange power for their respective areas. However a Power Procurement Group has been formed to coordinate the procurement and sale of power which is headed by a DTL Officer. Now DTL is responsible only for efficient transmission of power.
Power Generating Stations.

Stoke Rochford Hall

Stoke Rochford Hall is a large house built in scenic grounds, with a nearby golf course, next to the A1 in south Lincolnshire, England.
History.
The remains of a Roman villa and bath house were identified by William Stukeley in 1739 and again in 1824 and 1960. No substantive ruins are preserved.
The Neville family had a house on the site in the 14th century. The estate passed to the Rochfords in the 15th century, from whence comes the name of the estate, and to the Coneys in the 16th century. It was purchased by Sir Edmund Turnor around the time he was knighted in 1663. He began building a grand house in 1665, which was demolished 1774. In 1794 the Turnors built a smaller house at Stoke, this was the house replaced by the current structure in the 1840s. The estate was occupied by Harry Wyndham Jefferson and his wife Gwendolen Mary Talbot at the beginning of the 20th century.
The present building dating from 1843 was designed by architect William Burn, for Christopher Turnor. For the rest of the 19th century and early 20th century it was owned by the Turnor family. Christopher Turnor's grandson sold of the Wragby estate in 1917. He started holding summer conferences at the hall. In August 1940, the estate was taken over by his first cousin, Major Herbert Broke Turnor.
In 1940 the house was requisitioned by the War Office, and used for a variety of purposes. 
It became the headquarters of the Second Battalion, the Parachute Regiment. It was in the Library at Stoke Rochford that the ill fated 1944 Arnhem ‘drop’ was planned.
Purchased in 1948 from the War Office by Kesteven County Council who built modern student accommodation, the hall was home to Kesteven College of Education, a teacher-training college which closed in 1978. It retains a connection with education, as the training and conference centre of the National Union of Teachers. It is not solely used by the NUT, but is used by national organisations and companies for conferences or seminars, being closely situated to the A1 and Grantham railway station. It has banqueting facilities and is used for wedding receptions and parties. It has the "Gym and Tonic" sports club and the Reflections Restaurant.
On 25 January 2005 a fire gutted the interior of the hall. It was restored by English Heritage which cost £12m over three years.
Architectural style.
The hall is built in a Jacobean style, with many chimneys. It was designed by William Burn, who also laid out the gardens in collaboration with William Andrews Nesfield. The gate lodge, also in a Jacobean style, was designed in 1834 by Cornelius Sherborne.
The front elevation of the Elizabethan stables was re-erected and the stone frontispieces still stand in the park. This carries the dates 1676 and 1704, representing their original erection and re-building.
Golf.
A Golf course was laid out in 1924 by Christopher Turnor. It is still in use and is home to Stoke Rochford golf club.

<doc id="20504023" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20504023" title="Ince Power Station">
Ince Power Station

Ince Power Station refers to two demolished power stations, which were located on a site near Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, North West England.
Ince A.
When the uranium enrichment plant at Capenhurst opened in 1949, it was realised that its power demand would require the construction of a new power station nearby. Rendel, Palmer & Tritton were appointed as the construction's civil engineering consultants, while the Central Electricity Authority engineered the station's electrical and mechanical plant.
The station was built on an plot of land acquired as a result of tidal borings. The main buildings were constructed where the load-bearing sandstone was at its highest level. After the removal of of top soil it was possible to construct the buildings directly upon hard bearing sand, removing the necessity of piled foundations. However, the cooling towers and north chimney did require piled foundations as the sandstone foundation sloped away from the power station site.
The station's main buildings were of a steel framed construction. The boiler house was clad using cellactite sheet cladding, and was of a semi-outdoor construction due to the speed of construction required. The turbine hall was a brick building with prefabricated stone used on window and door surrounds. The building's roof was made from asbestos cement. The floors in the station were made of quarry tile and terrazzo. The station's coal bunkers were steel plate and girder constructions. The entire building measured long by wide, containing approximately 3,800 tonnes of steel. The station also had two tall chimneys. They were made from brick and had internal diameters of . They were supported upon tall concrete plinths. The administration and amenity block was built next to the station, and connected to the turbine hall by an overhead access bridge. The block contained the station's control room, along with laboratories, administration offices, a canteen, lockers and showers. It was heated by excess steam bled from the turbines.
Ince A Power Station was opened on 9 October 1957 by Lord Citrine, the chairman of the Central Electricity Authority. The station used four 60 megawatt (MW) turbo alternators, giving the station a total generation capacity of 240 MW. Each turbine was supplied with steam from a coal-fired boiler at a rate of per hour, and at a temperature of 480 °C. Each boiler and turbine set operated as an independent generating unit, with no interconnection of boilers. It was also realised mid-way through the station's construction, that the station should be capable of duel firing heavy fuel oil. Electricity was generated at 12.8 kilovolts (kV). It was then passed through a transformer which increased the voltage to 132 kV, before passing into the national grid.
Coal was delivered to the station's coal storage area by rail from the East Midlands coalfields.
Water for the station's systems was taken from the River Dee at Chester, and taken to the station by a pipeline built by the West Cheshire Water Board to serve the power station and the uranium enrichment plant. The water was cooled using four hyperboloid natural draft cooling towers. Each tower was tall and had a base diameter, with a cooling capacity of 2.75 million gallons per hour.
Ince B.
Ince B Power Station built as part of the Dash for Oil in the UK during the 1960s, schemed as being a base load operating power station. The choice of the Ince site for a large new oil-fired station was politically influenced as the government wanted a station in the North West of England, which led to a rumour that the power station was built with the only purpose of creating jobs.
The station's construction suffered lengthy delays. Its transmission system wasn't adequate to handle the large flow of electricity from the nuclear power stations to the north. There were also faults with the station's rotors, which required them returning to the manufacturer's works. The station eventually used two national spares. Low construction staff productivity was also a problem, which almost led to the project being completely abandoned. The station had eventually began operating by March 1984, when it achieved the second highest thermal efficiency in the country for a plant of its size, after Pembroke Power Station in Wales.
The station occupied a site. Its boiler house measured by and high. The turbine hall was by and high. It used two 500 MW Parsons generators, along with two 25 MW Avon gas turbines. However, in 1993, one of the station's two units, Unit 5, was converted to burn orimulsion. Its boilers were provided by Clarke Chapman Ltd. The station B had a single chimney, with a diameter of which tapered to . The station used a single hyperboloid induced draft cooling tower, which stood at tall.
Fuel oil was supplied directly to the station by a pipeline, directly from Shell's Stanlow Oil Refinery. Oil was also brought to the station by ship, via a berth on the Manchester Ship Canal.
The station was controlled by two GEC 2050 computers.
Closure and demolition.
The A Station was closed and demolished in the mid-1980s, however its single remaining cooling tower was left standing until 1999. The B Station ceased generating electricity in March 1997 and demolition of the structures commenced a couple of years later. The station's chimney was demolished on 28 April 1999. The station's cooling tower was demolished on 5 December 1999 along with the A Station's remaining cooling tower.

<doc id="20504060" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20504060" title="Verona, North Carolina">
Verona, North Carolina

Verona is a small town in rural Onslow County, on the outskirts of Jacksonville, North Carolina. It is located off of U.S. Route 17, seven miles (11 km) to the south of Jacksonville, and ten miles (16 km) to the north of Holly Ridge. Verona is bordered by Highway 17 to the east, Verona Rd. to the north, and High Hill Rd. to the South. High Hill Rd and Verona Rd. intersect to form the western boundary. 
The population of Verona in the 2000 census was approximately 178 people. The demographic breakdown was: Caucasian: 86%, Hispanic: 9%, African-American: < 5%, Other: < 2%.
Industry.
Most of Verona's population consists of middle class workers in the cities of Jacksonville, or Holly Ridge. The largest business is the Verona Quik Mart, a convenience store and gas station. The second largest business in Verona is the Jones LP gas and equipment service. The oldest business still operating in Verona today is Louie Foy’s Homemade Honey retail. Mr. Foy has his own hives and has been canning his own honey to sell for decades.
Historical Importance.
There have been settlers in the Verona area since the early 18th century. 
Founding families of Verona, many of which are still there today include the Foy, Padgett, Rochelle, Ottoway, Brown, Davis, Fisher, and Parker families.
The Railroad.
In 1897, The Wilmington, New Bern and Norfolk Railroad Company laid a railway from Jacksonville, to Wilmington, running through Verona. The Railway through Verona ran from 1897 to 1984, when the trains where shut down, and the tracks were torn up. Shortly after the tracks were laid, a large three story train station was built in Verona on the intersection of Loy Avenue and Verona Rd. Though the tracks operated until 1984, the Train Station shut down in the late 1930s. The Railway mostly carried lumber and industrial supplies from Jacksonville to Wilmington. During World War II, and the Korean War the railway played a vital role in the USA’s war effort as a troop train route. Marines were carried from the newly constructed Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune to the port of Wilmington to be deployed. 
After the old train station was shut down the antique structure remained, serving many purposes throughout the years before it caught fire and burned down in 2002. Right after it was shut down as a train station, it was used as a post office and general store. From around 1900 to the 1960s, there was a post office in Verona, and Verona was given its address: Verona, NC. In the 1960s the county townships were reorganized, and Verona became part of rural Jacksonville, causing the address of Verona’s citizens to change to Jacksonville, NC. Verona lost its post office and was put on the city postal route.
United States Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune.
In the year 1941, the United States Government began building Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, the largest amphibious base in the country. To gain the property for the base, Eminent Domain was enforced condemning the lands of many Verona residents, some of which lost land that had been in their families for over a century. 
In a personal account by Myrtle Margaret Fisher published in The Heritage of Onslow County, she said: 
They (her parents Joseph Cephus Fisher and Sarah Margaret Swinson Fisher) made their home at Maple Hill for several years and some of the children were born there but most of us were born at Verona on the “Old Fisher Place” which has long since grown up and abandoned. After their move to the Loop Road of Verona, which was across the tracks on property purchased from Mama’s brother Vannie, four more children were born making us a family of four children.
Eventually our farm became a self supporting one. Unknowingly, we would live on condemned property in the Stump Sound Township, where the U.S. Government had preconceived ideas of building a very large military complex on the coastal waters of our county for the training of soldiers. It would later become the largest amphibious base in the world. Time passed with many attempts to obtain a better price than my parents were offered for the farm and acreage, so Daddy was forced to sell to the government. The sale was finalized on October 30, 1941. It was disbursed as follows: for the 210 acres of land: $2505.00, dwelling: $800.00, barn: $200.00, smoke house: $35.00, poultry house: $5.00, two tobacco barns: $200.00, and for all the timber they were paid $600.00. This wasn’t nearly enough for the farm and timber but there was nothing else they felt could be done as they had several meetings with government officials with no let-up on price.
Following the building of Camp Lejeune many families were put in situations like Ms. Myrtle Fisher’s family, with no house, and no land and very little compensation for the property they were forced to sell to the government. A major problem was that when the base came, it brought industry to Jacksonville, increasing the value of the land. So the displaced persons that had to sell to the government were now looking for new land with very little money, and property prices much, much higher. It took most individuals two to five years to resettle, and some had to leave the county completely to find property.

<doc id="20504088" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20504088" title="Expansion deflection nozzle">
Expansion deflection nozzle

The expansion-deflection nozzle is an advanced rocket nozzle which achieves altitude compensation through interaction of the exhaust gas with the atmosphere, much like the plug and aerospike nozzles.
Description.
It appears much like a standard bell nozzle, but at the throat is a 'centrebody' or 'pintle' which deflects the flow towards the walls. The exhaust gas flows past this in a more outward direction than in standard bell nozzles while expanding before being turned towards the exit. This allows for shorter nozzles than the standard design whilst maintaining nozzle expansion ratios. Because of the atmospheric boundary, the atmospheric pressure affects the exit area ratio so that atmospheric compensation can be obtained up to the geometric maximum allowed by the specific nozzle.
The nozzle operates in two distinct modes: open and closed. In closed wake mode, the exhaust gas fills the entire nozzle exit area. The ambient pressure at which the wake changes from open to closed modes is called the design pressure. If the ambient pressure reduces any further, additional expansion will occur outside of the nozzle much like a standard bell nozzle and no altitude compensation effect will be gained. In open wake mode, the exit area is dependant on the ambient pressure and the exhaust gas exits the nozzle as an annulus as it does not fill the entire nozzle. Because the ambient pressure controls the exit area, the area ratio should be perfectly compensating to the altitude up to the design pressure.
If the pintle is designed to move along its axis of rotation, the throat area can be varied. This would allow for effective throttling, whilst maintaining chamber pressure.
Like the aerospike and plug nozzles, if modular combustion chambers were used in place of a single combustion chamber, then thrust vectoring would be achievable by throttling the flow to various chambers.
Developed models.
The ED nozzle has been known about since the 1960s and there has been several attempts to develop it, with several reaching the level of static hot-firings. These were attempted by private companies, so no literature exists in the public domain from these efforts, which include the 'Expansion-Deflection 50k' (Rocketdyne), the 'Expansion-Deflection 10k' (Rocketdyne) and the RD-0126 (CADB). Rocketdyne also developed a third, smaller E-D nozzle.
Rocketdyne carried out their work during an initial surge in interest in the 1960s, initially developing the E-D 50k nozzle, which had a chamber pressure of 20.7 bar (2.07 MPa) delivering a thrust of 50,000 lbf (220 kN) and was uncooled, allowing it to be tested for a couple seconds at a time. The E-D 10k nozzle had a chamber pressure of 15.5 bar (1.55 MPa) delivering 10,000 lbf (44.5 kN), a cooled-thrust chamber and was tested in an altitude simulation facility. The smaller E-D nozzle developed 9900 lbf (44 kN) and was also used to test the altitude compensation ability. These tests confirmed a performance advantage over equivalent bell nozzles.
The Chemical Automatics Design Bureau E-D nozzle was fully cooled and used for hot-fire tests in 1998. Its centrebody houses the combustion chamber (much like the Astrium design mentioned below) allowing for a reduction in length, beyond that of the improved contouring.
Wickman Spacecraft & Propulsion Company have developed and static-tested a solid motor in conjunction with an E-D.
The University of Bristol, UK, has recently successfully tested gaseous Hydrogen/Air propellants as part of the STERN project. They are also involved in developing knowledge of the in-flight behaviour of the E-D nozzle using a hybrid rocket motor.
Potential uses.
While research into this nozzle continues, it could be used before all its advantages are developed. As an upper stage, where it would be used in a low ambient pressure/vacuum environment specifically in closed wake mode, an E-D nozzle would offer weight reductions, length reductions and a potential increase to the specific impulse over bell nozzles (depending on engine cycle) allowing increased payloads. A study suggests it could add an additional to the payload of an Ariane 5 over the new Vinci engine provided it is also an expander cycle. Such a nozzle could be brought into service before its altitude compensation abilities were developed.
It is also being investigated for Reaction Engines Skylon spaceplane. Employment on a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket would use an E-D nozzle's altitude compensating abilities fully, allowing for a substantial increase in payload. Reaction Engines, Airborne Engineering and the University of Bristol are currently involved in the STERN (Static Test Expansion deflection Rocket Nozzle) project to assess the abilities of the E-D nozzle, and to develop the technology.

2005–06 Hibernian F.C. season

Season 2005–06 was a season of missed opportunities for Hibernian. The team started strongly in the league, winning 10 of their first 14 games, but this form dipped after Christmas. The Scottish Cup seemed to be opening up for Hibs after they defeated Rangers 3–0 at Ibrox in the fourth round, but they then lost 4–0 in an Edinburgh derby semi–final against Hearts. Hibs lost 3–0 in the quarter–final of the Scottish League Cup at Dunfermline, and were well beaten by Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in the UEFA Cup.
Pre-season.
Hibs went on a three match tour of Ireland in early July, beating St Patrick's Athletic and drawing with Cork City and Shamrock Rovers. This was followed by a series of friendly matches against Scottish Football League clubs. Unusually, two of these matches were played on the same day as Hibs split their squad between matches at Ayr United and Queen of the South. Hibs then played a match against Rot-Weiss Essen to mark the 50th anniversary of the first European Cup competition before completing their pre-season schedule with a 1–0 win against Hartlepool United.
League season.
Hibs began the season inauspiciously, drawing 1–1 at home to Dunfermline, although a draw represented something of a recovery having been a goal and a man down at half time. The second match was an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle, where Hibs felt the full brunt of a powerful new Hearts side under the management of George Burley. Hibs lost 4–0 as Hearts went on to start the season with eight consecutive league wins.
Hibs themselves then went on a run of form, winning four league games in a row. The obvious highlight of this run was a 3–0 win at Ibrox, which was Hibs' first win there since 1995. Ivan Sproule, who had been thinking of returning to his native Northern Ireland, scored all the goals as a second half substitute for Garry O'Connor. Sproule became the first visiting player to score a hat-trick at Ibrox since Allan Johnston did it for Hearts in 1996, and the first Hibs player to achieve the feat in more than 100 years.
Although Hibs then lost home matches to Celtic and Inverness immediately after their European ties, they then went on another run of victories, this time five in succession. The highlight of this run was the 2–0 Edinburgh derby win against Hearts, which ended their unbeaten start to the season. Despite a home defeat by Falkirk where Hibs had led 2–0, a convincing 2–1 win against Rangers led to media speculation that Hibs could challenge for the league title, which Tony Mowbray played down.

UEFA Cup.
Having finished third in the Scottish Premier League table in the previous season, Hibs qualified directly into the first round proper of the UEFA Cup. They were drawn against Ukrainian Premier League side Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, with Hibs due to play at home first. The match at Easter Road was a goalless draw, although Hibs hit the woodwork twice. Dnipro took the lead early in the return match thanks to a deflected goal, but Derek Riordan equalised midway through the first half. Hibs conceded two goals before half-time, however, and Dnipro added two more late goals on the counter-attack. This eliminated Hibs at the first hurdle, as they had been in their previous entry in 2001.
Scottish League Cup.
As one of the European qualifiers from the previous season, Hibs were given a bye to the last 16 of the competition. In that round they defeated Ayr United 2–1 at Somerset Park. In the quarter-final, Hibs were drawn to play Dunfermline Athletic at East End Park. Dunfermline were struggling in the SPL and had recently lost at home to Hibs in the league, but they turned this form on its head to comfortably beat Hibs 3–0 in the League Cup, ending Hibs' involvement in the competition.
Scottish Cup.
Hibs had a straightforward win in the last 32 of the Scottish Cup at home to Arbroath. In the last 16 they were given the daunting task of facing Rangers at Ibrox, although Hibs had won 3–0 at Ibrox earlier in the season thanks to Ivan Sproule's hat-trick. Their preparations for the game were not helped when Rangers made an offer to sign Derek Riordan, Hibs' top scorer, in the week before the match. Hibs rejected Rangers' offer, but accepted offers from foreign clubs that Riordan himself turned down. This transfer activity led Tony Mowbray to decide to leave Riordan on the bench for the match at Ibrox, just as he had done before the previous match at that ground that season. Riordan ended up making a cameo appearance, setting up the third goal for Chris Killen in a second 3–0 win for Hibs at Ibrox, and their third victory in all over Rangers that season. Garry O'Connor and Sproule had scored Hibs' first two goals early in the second half, with Simon Brown gaining some credit for producing an excellent save from Bob Malcolm during the first half.
With Celtic having already been eliminated in a shock defeat by Clyde in the last 32, the Scottish Cup had been opened up for a first winner from outside the Old Firm since Hearts in 1998. The first Scottish Cup Final without an Old Firm club present since 1997 was also guaranteed by those two results. In the quarter-final, Hibs were drawn to play SPL club Falkirk away. Hibs progressed through to the semi-final after a 5–1 victory at the Falkirk Stadium. Hibs were joined in the semi-finals by Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts and Scottish Football League clubs Dundee and Gretna. Gretna beat Dundee 3–0 in the first semi-final, leaving Hibs and Hearts to contest the right to face a Second Division side in a Cup Final where they would be heavy favourite.
The problem for Hibs was that they had been seriously weakened by the time of that semi-final. Derek Riordan had not been sold in the January window, but was suspended for the semi-final after collecting a second yellow card of the competition against Falkirk. Garry O'Connor had been sold to Lokomotiv Moscow straight after the quarter-final win. Chris Killen had failed a late fitness test and Paul Dalglish was cup-tied to Livingston. Midfielders Scott Brown and Michael Stewart were also unavailable due to injury.
These selection problems, particularly in attack, meant that Mowbray drafted in Moroccan youngster Abdessalam Benjelloun for his debut, and also started with youngster Steven Fletcher in attack. He also juggled the other areas of the team by moving Gary Caldwell into midfield and bringing Chris Hogg into defence. The makeshift Hibs side lost the match 4–0 and had Sproule and Gary Smith sent off. Former Hibs player Paul Hartley scored a hat-trick, leaving Mowbray to wonder whether Hibs would have won if the absent players had been available.
Transfers.
Hibs did not make many major changes from the squad that had finished third in the SPL in the previous season. Captain Ian Murray moved to Rangers under freedom of contract, while Hibs signed Michael Stewart, who had been on loan at Hearts. Tony Mowbray also signed Zbigniew Małkowski to play in goal, as Simon Brown had made some errors towards the end of the previous season.
During the winter, Hibs brought in Chris Killen, Oumar Kondé and Paul Dalglish in an attempt to strengthen a squad that was being stretched by injuries. The only major transfer during the season was the sale of Garry O'Connor to Lokomotiv Moscow at the start of March 2006. This transfer went ahead outside of the normal British transfer windows because the Russian Premier League transfer window was still open. O'Connor's transfer started a trend of Hibs selling players, as Kevin Thomson, Scott Brown, Steven Whittaker and David Murphy all moved for fees in excess of £1.5M over the course of the next two years.
Player stats.
During the 2005–06 season, Hibs used 31 different players in competitive games. The table below shows the number of appearances and goals scored by each player.

UBIFS

The Unsorted Block Image File System (UBIFS) is a successor to JFFS2, and competitor to LogFS, as a file system for use with raw flash memory media.
The file system is developed by Nokia engineers with help of the University of Szeged, Hungary.
Note that UBIFS works on top of an unsorted block images device, which is itself on top of a memory technology device (MTD). MTDs are not to be used directly. Two major differences between UBIFS and JFFS2 are that UBIFS supports write caching, and UBIFS errs on the pessimistic side of free space calculation. UBIFS tends to perform better than JFFS2 for large NAND FLASH devices. This is a consequence of the UBIFS design goals: faster mounting, quicker access to large files, and improved write speeds. UBIFS also preserves or improves upon JFFS2's on-the-fly compression, recoverability and power fail tolerance. UBIFS's on-the-fly data compression allows zlib (deflate algorithm) or LZO.
JFFS2 stores filesystem indexes in memory whereas UBIFS stores indexes in flash. This directly impacts the scalability of JFFS2 as the tables must be rebuilt every time the volume is mounted. Also, the JFFS2 tables may consume enough system RAM that some images may be unusable.
Unsorted Block Images.
Unsorted block images (UBI) is an "erase block" management layer for flash memory devices. UBI serves two purposes, tracking NAND flash "bad blocks" and providing wear leveling. Wear leveling spreads the erases and writes across the entire flash device. UBI presents logical "erase blocks" to higher layers and maps these to physical flash "erase blocks". UBI was written specifically for UBIFS so that it does not have to deal with wear leveling and "bad blocks". However, UBI may also be useful with cramfs and NAND flash; cramfs is not aware of NAND flash "bad blocks".
Fastmap.
UBI was augmented in Linux 3.7 with "fastmap" support. "Fastmap" maintains an on-disk version of information previously created in memory by scanning the entire flash device. The code falls back to the previous mechanism of a full scan on failures and older UBI systems will simply ignore the "fastmap" information.

Fanny Rabel

Fanny Rabel (Poland, August 27, 1922 - Mexico City, November 25, 2008), born "Fanny Rabinovich",was a Polish-born Mexican artist who is considered to be the first modern female muralist and one of the youngest associated with the Mexican muralism of the early to mid 20th century. She and her family arrived to Mexico in 1938 from Europe and she studied art at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda", where she met and became friends with Frida Kahlo. She became the only female member of “Los Fridos” a group of students under Kahlo’s tutelage. She also worked as an assistant and apprentice to Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros, painting a number of murals of her own during her career. The most important of this is Ronda en el tiempo at the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. She also created canvases and other works, with children often featured in her work and one the first of her generation to work with ecological themes in a series of works begun in 1979.
Life.
Fanny Rabel was born Fanny Rabinovich on August 27, 1922 in Poland to a Polish-Jewish couple from a family of traveling actors. When she was a child, she could not have dolls, according to her daughter Paloma, so she drew the ones she saw in store windows. Her family was cultured with her sister Malka becoming a theatre critic. 
The family moved to Paris in 1929, where she first attended school. They then moved to Mexico in 1938. She entered the Escuela Nocturna para Trabajadores, where she took classes in drawing and engraving.
Her anti Nazi and anti Fascism politics resulted in her participation in a mural called Retrato de la Burguesía in1940 for the Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas building on Alfonso Caso Street in Mexico City. Rabel met a group of exiled Spaniards in Mexico along with Antonio Pujol, who invited her to take part in a mural project headed by him, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Joseph Renau, Luis Arenal, Antonio Rodríguez Luna and Miguel Prieto. This work depicted, among other things, children killed by Nazi bombing in Spain.
She entered the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda" shortly after it was established in 1942, taking classes with José Chávez Morado, Feliciano Peña and Frida Kahlo, with whom she became close friends. (universal) . She also became one of Frida Kahlo’s students at the Casa Azul, a group of four called “Los Fridos” (a play on Frida’s name). She was the only female in this group, along with men: Guillermo Monroy, Arturo García Bustos and Arturo Estrada. Other teachers including Francisco Zúñiga, Alfredo Zalce, Raúl Anguiano, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Carlos Orozco Romero and Diego Rivera.
Her original last name was Rabinovich but she changed it during her career.
She married urologist Jaime Woolrich and had two children Abel and Paloma Woolrich, both of which became actors.
She lived for decades at an apartment/student on Martinez de Castro Street in the San Miguel Chapultepec neighborhood in Mexico City. Near the end of her life she lost most of her memory, with Alzheimers suspected. She was almost evicted from apartment at this time when it was deemed unsafe, but she was still living there when she died. Rabel died on November 25, 2008 and was buried at the Panteón Israelita. She was survived by her daughter Paloma and her grandchildren.
Career.
Rabel had her first exhibition of her work in 1945 with twenty four oils, thirteen drawings and eight engravings at the Liga Popular Israelita with Frida Kahlo writing the presentation. In 1955, she had an individual exhibition at the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana . She had a large exhibition at the museum of the Palacio de Bellas Artes to commemorate a half century of her work. Her last exhibition was in 2007 at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana . Her work can be found in the collections in over fifteen countries including those of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress in Washington, the Royal Academy of Denmark, the National Library in Paris, the Casa de las Américas in Havana, the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla and the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City.
She is considered to be the first female muralist in Mexico. She was an assistant to Diego Rivera while he worked on the frescos for the National Palace and an apprentice to David Alfaro Siqueiros. Her most important mural is Ronda en el tiempo located in the Museo Nacional de Antropología, which was created from 1964 to 1965. She also created murals at the Unidad de Lavaderos Público de Tepalcatitlán (1945), Sobrevivencia, Alfabetización in Coyoacán in 1952 Sobrevivencia de un pueblo at the Centro Deportivo Israelita (1957) Hacia la salud for the Hospital Infantil de México (1982), La familia mexicana at the Registro Público de la Propiedad (1984) (which Rabel preferred to title Abolición de la propiedad privada) and at the Imprenta Artgraf. In collaboration with other artists, she participated in the creation of the murals at the La Rosita pulque bar (disappeared) and at the Casa de la Madre Soltera.
She was a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana and the Taller de Gráfica Popular, joining both in 1950.
A group of her friends nominated her for the Premio Nacional de Arte but it was denied. However, her work has been honored with a number of retrospective exhibits before and after her death. In 2007, there was a retrospective of her work at the Festival de México in the historic center of Mexico City at the House of the First Print Shop in the Americas with the title of La Fanny de los Fridos. Her work was featured at an exhibition called Fanny Rabel y Mujeres del Salón de la Plástica Mexicana held at the José Vasconcelos Library . The Salón de la Plástica Mexicana had a retrospective of her work after he death called Retrospectiva in Memoriam, Fanny Rabel (1922-2008) held at the Museum of the Universidad Popular Autónoma del Estado de Puebla .
Artistry.
Rabel is considered to be the first modern female muralist in Mexico although she also did significant work in painting, engraving, drawing and ceramic sculpture. Her work has been classes as poetic Surrealism, Neo-expressionism and is also considered part of the Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (the dominant art movement of the early to mid 20th century in Mexico) as one of the youngest muralists to be associated with it along with Arnold Belkin and José Hernández Delga .
Rabel was more drawn to depicting mankind’s pain rather than happiness, sharing other Mexican muralist’s concerns about social injustice. However, she stated to Leopoldo Méndez that she could not create combative works, with clenched fists and fierce faces, and she wanted to leave the Taller de Gráfica Popular. Méndez convinced her to stay, saying that more tender images are important to political struggle as well. Children with Mexican faces are common in her work, often with expressions between laughter and tears. They are generally poor children, meant to depict the socioeconomically marginalized populations in the country. However, she did not paint outright tragedy or tears. In many of her works, the different social classes of Mexico are contrasted, often with indigenous peoples. The gentleness of her works, she insisted was “for the revolution.” She also did one portrait of Frida Kahlo, a pencil drawing which was first exhibited near the end of her life.
She was economically prosperous, something which bothered her as she worried about exploiting the poor for art. Unlike artists which avoided the news and popular culture as to not poorly influence their art, Rabel attended concerts, listened to the radio and was a fan of film from both Mexico and Hollywood.
She was one of the first of her generation to develop themes related to ecology, the changes in Mexico City, against technocracy and emphasis on commerce. She began a series of paintings in 1979 called “Réquiem por una ciudad” depicting what she considered to be the destruction of Mexico City by smog, traffic and garbage. The works include Diálogo capitalino, Muerte citadina, Los peatones van al cielo, El profundo drenaje, La rebelión de los peatones and México, D.F. Réquiem para una ciudad in 1979 considers three themes, the lack of human communication, the traffic and pollution of the air and ground. La rebelión de los peatones in 1987, expresses a worry about the centralization of the city the excess of cars.

Faithful Teate

Faithful Teate (c. 1626 - 1666) was a Protestant clergyman and poet from County Cavan, Ireland. He is sometimes known as "Faithful Tate" or "Faithfull Teate". He was the father of the poet laureate, Nahum Tate.
Background.
He was the son of Faithful Teate, a doctor of divinity with whom he has often been confused. The elder Teate was made rector at Ballyhaise, Co. Cavan. Reports that he had informed on the rebels during the 1641 Rebellion, resulted in his house being burned. Two or three (sources vary) of Teate's children are reported to have died as a result of hardships endured in that period.
Career and poetry.
Faithful Teate the younger entered Trinity College Dublin in 1641 at age fourteen and was later ordained into the Church of Ireland. He moved to England and studied at Cambridge before being appointed minister at Sudbury in Suffolk. He was back in Dublin by 1660 and was rector of St. Werburgh's church in Dublin, but his puritan principles did not allow him to accept the new restoration government's policy on episcopacy and he was sacked. He died at the age of forty in 1666. 
While at Suffolk he composed a long meditative poem "Ter Tria: or the Doctrine of the Three Sacred Persons, Father, Son and Spirit..." (1658). The poem enjoyed considerable success in its day. It was reprinted in 1669 and a German edition and translation followed in 1699. He also wrote didactic prose including "A Scripture Map of the Wilderness of Sin and Way to Canaan" (1655). The first modern edition of his complete poetical works was published by Four Courts Press in 2007.
Family.
This second Faithful Teate was the father of the poet laureate Nahum Tate, who went by 'Tate' rather than 'Teate' only in adulthood. Nahum was the second of seven children born to Faithful and his wife Katherine Kenetie. The eldest of these children was also called 'Faithful'. As noted above, there is considerable confusion in earlier accounts of the family, where it was stated that the first Faithful Teate was the father, instead of the grandfather, of Nahum. There are, in fact, three 'Faithful' Teates, the grandfather, father and brother of Nahum Tate.

River of Love

"River of Love" is the title of a song written by Billy Burnette, Shawn Camp and Dennis Morgan, and recorded by American country music artist George Strait. It was released in November 2008 as the third single from the album "Troubadour". The 87th single of his career, it is also his 80th Top Ten on the "Billboard" country charts, as well as his 44th Number One.
Content.
"River of Love" is a moderate up-tempo, with steel-string acoustic guitar and pedal steel guitar accompaniment. Shawn Camp, Billy Burnette and Dennis Morgan, who wrote the song, all sing backing vocals on it as well. The lyrics use a river as a metaphor for love ("Let's go rollin' on the river of love").
According to "Country Weekly", Morgan had come to Camp with a melody in his head. Camp then built on the melody by playing along with a ukulele that Cowboy Jack Clement had given him, when Burnette joined in on his own ukulele, and they came up with the line "river of love". According to Camp, "It was just such an infectious groove, and it just kind of rolled out. The whole song was just two chords and that lick."
Reception.
Matt Bjorke of Roughstock, a country music review site, gave "River of Love" a mixed review. Although he called it an "undoubtedly fun song" and said "it's all about feel and groove", he added that "there's nothing really interesting about the song, other than the spirited steel guitar solo." Brady Vercher, in his review of "Troubadour" for The 9513, described the song as having an "island vibe" similar to a Kenny Chesney song, calling it one of the weakest tracks on the album.
Chart performance.
"River of Love" debuted at number 45 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs charts dated for the week of November 22, 2008. The song became Strait's 44th "Billboard" Number One on the chart week of April 18, 2009. One week later, it fell to number 9, taking the biggest fall from number 1 on that chart since Carrie Underwood's "So Small" fell from number 1 to number 10 on the chart week of December 22, 2007.

Ascot-Pullin 500

The Ascot-Pullin 500 was a motorcycle made by Ascot-Pullin Motorcycles in Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1928. As an unpdate version of the Pullin motor bicycle of 1919, the Ascot-Pullin 500 overhead valve single was the first time hydraulic brakes were used on a motorcycle.
History.
In 1919, British inventor Cyril Pullin and Stanley L. Groom produced the Pullin motor bicycle, a wheeled machine that included a novel two-stroke engine and extensive manufacture use of steel pressings that anticipated developments by British motorcycle manufacturer Ariel Motorcycles in the late 1950s and Japanese motorcycle manufacturers in 1960s. The bicycle was patented in 1920. Since 1920, Pullin had been working with Stanley Groom to develop and patent a two-stroke motorcycle with a unique design of pressed sheet metal frame and forks. After working on a range of other inventions including the Ascot car, Pullin teamed up with Groom again to further develop their ideas and patent the Ascot Pullin motorcycle, with a four-stroke rather than two-cycle engine. At a time when manufacturers were taking a very traditional approach to motorcycle design with conventional frames and engine layout, Pullin and Grom were keen to create an enclosed feel by mounting the engine horizontally within a pressed-steel frame. As well as the hydraulic brakes, Pullin also designed a telescopic centre stand and an adjustable windshield, complete with a windscreen wiper and rear-view mirror, as well as a fully enclosed chain and interchangeable wheels.
With estimated , the Ascot-Pullin was capable of , but less than 500 were produced so few survive to this day.
Pullin's influence can be seen in the emergence of the Ariel Leader and the Vincent Black Prince thirty years later, which both developed the enclosed concept in an attempt to attract a wider range of customers. As with the Ascot-Pullin, however, the fully enclosed look has never really led to high volume sales but instead attracts a niche market.
At present, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recognizes that the first hydraulic brakes on motorcycles occurred in 1952.

The primary role of the BAF was to provide support and medevac services to the ground units of the Bophuthatswana's army. The BAF operated from several bases, one being Mmabatho AFB.
All surviving aircraft and helicopters were integrated into the South African Air Force on 27 April 1994.
History.
An air component of the BDF was born on March 19, 1981 with the purchase of an Alouette III.
In 1982, the unit became known as "Bophutatswana Air Wing" with the arrival of a 2nd Alouette III and 2 Helio H-295s. In 1983, 2 Partenavia P.68s and an AS-355 Écureuil were purchased - the latter was assigned to VIP transports. In November 1989, it was replaced by an SA-365N1 Dauphin.
In 1985, a CASA 212-200 Aviocar was purchased to transport paratroopers, a CASA 212-300 was received in 1987. The 2 Helios were withdrawn from service and replaced by 2 MBB/Kawasaki BK-117s.
With the arrival of so many new aircraft, the Bophuthatswana Air Wing took the name Bophuthatswana Air Force in late 1987.

Dooleys (album)

Dooleys was the first UK album by British pop group The Dooleys. It was released on GTO Records in 1978 and featured the top 20 hits "Think I'm Gonna Fall in Love with You", "Love of My Life" and "A Rose Has to Die".
Background.
The Dooleys had been a recording act for four years by this point, but it wasn't until mid 1977 when they scored their first chart hit with "Think I'm Gonna Fall in Love With You", which reached the UK top 20. Follow-up single "Love of My Life" became a top 10 hit, while "Don't Take it Lyin' Down" was also a minor hit. The group then released this, their first studio album. (They had released an earlier album in Russia, which was a live album recorded while they toured there, and had sold well.)) Despite three hit singles, the album failed to chart. After its release, another single was taken from it; "A Rose Has to Die", which also was a top 20 success, peaking at No.11. The album was mainly produced by Ben Findon, who would go on to be songwriter and producer for the group for a few more years and would guide them through their hit-making period. The album also included "Hands Across the Sea", which had been The Dooleys first ever single back in 1974, and had also been an entry into A Song for Europe that year, performed by Olivia Newton-John. "A Rose Has to Die" and "Stone Walls" were previously recorded by South African singer, Dennis East, the former also having been recorded by UK group The Ryders, while "What's Gonna Happen to Our Love" had been recorded by Billy Ocean.
Soon after the release of the album, the group's younger sister, Helen Dooley joined the line-up, after having contributed to the writing of one of this album's tracks.
"Dooleys" was released on Compact disc for the first time on 14 September 2009 in a double-pack with "The Chosen Few".

Comrades and Strangers

Comrades and Strangers is the memoir of Michael Harrold, one of the first Britons to reside in North Korea. The book was written to demystify North Korean society. 
History.
Harrold, who sought a year or two of adventure after graduating from university, flew to Pyongyang, North Korea, in the spring of 1987 after accepting employment in the country’s Foreign Languages Publishing House, where he assisted in the translation of President Kim Il Sung’s words into English. In the book, Harrold intertwines his personal experiences living and working in the country with the recent history of Korea.
In the early days, Harrold enjoyed his important status and the accompanying trappings of his work in North Korea. In addition to revising the words of President Kim Il Sung, he was given a prominent position at ceremonial events. Moreover, he was relatively well-paid. This relatively high salary allowed for a social life that was closed to all but the other foreigners in Pyongyang and a small North Korean elite. Although his interaction with North Koreans was severely restricted, he did become acquainted with some of Pyongyang’s better off. 
Harrold spent nearly seven years in North Korea, during which time he had many unusual experiences that make fascinating reading. He also developed a relatively unique understanding of North Korean society. 
Eventually, circumstances led to Harrold's being forced to leave the country. As a result, he was left with a deep sense of resentment toward North Korea. Looking back on his experiences, Harrold admits his earlier naïveté, when he believed that “international problems could best be resolved by ordinary people over a pint or two of beer (403).” In the end, he was critical of North Korea; nevertheless, he refused to blame the North Korean leadership for all the problems facing the country today, arguing that international actors, namely the United States, share the responsibility.

<doc id="20504578" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20504578" title="J. J. Rouse">
J. J. Rouse

J.J. Rouse was a Canadian Plymouth Brethren Evangelist, associated with early Canadian Gospel Hall Brethren.
Early life and conversion.
He was born May 15, 1869 on a farm in the township of Oro, Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada. He became a Christian in March 1885 at 15 years of age.
Early years.
In his early years, Rouse claims his life was a testimony to the truth of Romans 3:16, "Destruction and misery are in their ways." He gave examples such as:
In his early teens, Rouse joined a gang of boys who blocked the door of the Presbyterian Church, sermon in progress, using wheels from the hay-rakes found in front of the blacksmith's shop. These, they packed into the church porch, so that the only way the congregation could get out was through the windows. Then, they tampered with their buggies so that the occupants would be thrown out on their way home from the meeting.
They would scare people by hiding out in the Knox Church cemetery at night with a ball of lamp-wick wrapped and sewn, soaked in coal-oil. They would put on leather mittens, and toss the lighted ball back and forth, putting the fear of ghosts into their superstitious neighbours
The climax of their antics came when Alexander Marshall, Dr. James Law, and Dr. J.N. Case had pitched a gospel tent across from his farm. One night, Rouse's gang led an old horse up to the tent, and pushed its head inside the door. Then they put a bull thistle under his tail, causing the horse to plunge into the tent, creating havoc and spoiling the meeting for the night.
Conversion.
As Rouse contemplated eternity, he became fearful of death and judgement. He tried to be good, and attended Methodist Church meetings, thinking this would get him to heaven. He went to Sunday School in the Sons of Temperance Hall where he memorized whole chapters and whole books of the Bible. But still, he had no assurance of salvation. On several occasions he had close calls, where he was sure he would die. On one such occasion, in March, 1885 he had a close call while turning the horses around in the snow and brush of a wood. Fearing death, he cried out, "Oh, God, I'm lost, there's no use of me trying to be good." He got the wood on, and was on his way home, when he saw that, according to Romans 5:6, "Christ died for the ungodly," and he remembered that moment as the time where he "passed from death unto life."
After his conversion, J.J. Rouse joined the Congregational church where his parents were members. He was very active in the church for nine or ten years. Shortly after, he aspired to become a missionary to Africa, through hearing the Congregational missionary, John Curry, tell of the work there.
Rouse's sister joined the Marshallites, which was the nickname they gave to the people of the assembly of Christians gathered in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ (after Mr. Alexander Marshall, who was the first to preach there). These "Marshallites" met at a Gospel Hall about four miles from the village of Rugby where the Rouse's lived. J.J. Rouse had no interest in meeting with these people, and passed remarks about them as, "Poor silly few, they have no minister, they just go in there to sit and look at one another."
College.
While attending college to become a Congregational minister, on a Saturday in the autumn of 1893, he walked along the main street of town and heard the singing of a hymn in an upstairs hall. He wondered what it was about, and went up to investigate. He found it to be a conference of Christians. He went to the meeting the next morning (Sunday), where Donald Munro spoke for an hour. In the course of this meeting, Mr. Munro gave ministry, and preached the Gospel (* see note 1 below). Mr. Munro mentioned that he had first been under the reins of a Congregational minister for four years after being saved. This remark irritated J.J. Rouse, who spoke of it in anger to another young man after the meeting. He was surprised that Mr. Munro was listening in on the conversation. J.J. Rouse relayed the incident thus: "Mr. Munro, in a very gentle way, and his gentleness seemed in a measure to subdue me, laid his hand upon my shoulder and said, 'My dear young man, there is one thing I would like you to do.' I replied by saying, 'if it is within reason I will do it.' Then he requested me to go home, and take my Bible and concordance, and see if I could find one place in the Word of God where it spoke about one man being set over a body of people, exercising the gifts of evangelist, pastor, and teacher, and receiving a salary. Having been brought up in the traditions of the church, I most assuredly believed I could find it." He went home and searched, and wrote years later, "I found it only condemned me, and now forty-three years have passed and I have not found it yet; for the simple reason it is not in the Word of God." This had given him great distress as he had been planning on becoming a Congregational minister.
He chose to compromise, and he joined the Baptists for a while. But he realized they had a Sectarian name, and a paid minister. He determined he would go to Moody Bible Institute, which was non-denominational. But he became ill. He believed the illness was sent by God to keep him from going to Moody, and to learn to be subdued by the Lord, and to obey.
In the Fellowship.
On Saturday, July 6, 1895, J.J. Rouse went into Orillia to seek the fellowhsip of those who gathered alone in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. But when he arrived in Orillia, he discovered that the people he was expecting to meet had left that day with a Bible carriage for Midland. So he boarded a train, went to Midland, where he found the Orillia brethren. They took him down to Georgian Bay where he was then baptized, Saturday evening, July 6, 1895. The next morning, he went with two of the brethren to the meeting in Waverly. He was interviewed by the elder brethren, and 'had the privilege for the first time of breaking the bread and drinking the wine in memory of the broken body, and poured out blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.' That night, he took part in the Gospel meeting. He preached on the texts, "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom 6:23), and "Lust when it hath conceived bringeth forth sin, and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death" (James 1:15).
The next night, back in Midland, J.J. Rouse told how he was saved, and immediately left on a tour through towns and villages with the Bible carriage. (see note 2 below)
Early work.
In the summer of 1895, J.J. Rouse entered into "God's College" for preachers. This consisted of studying the Bible and working with the brethren as they travelled about with the Gospel.

Supreeme

Supreeme were an American rap group. Members include Shaka "Tom Cruz" Girvan aka Dope Pope, Negashi Armada, and Sam "King Self" Terrell. Girvan produces all of the music, and all three members contribute lyrical content and stylistic elements. They are best known for their release "Supremacy" (Record Collection, 2006) but have since been up-streamed to Warner Bros. Records. Supreeme can be found listed under List of current Warner Bros. Records artists. Their music is available through iTunes and Amazon.com. Numerous mixtapes and underground albums have been circulated through free internet downloads. Though Supreeme has enjoyed limited commercial success, they are an influential and critically acclaimed group. Perhaps most notably, Supreeme was the critics' pick for best hip hop act in Atlanta in Creative Loafing's annual "Best of Atlanta" in 2007 
History.
Supreeme was founded in the spring of 2003 in Atlanta, GA while the members skipped class together in high school. All three members attended Henry W. Grady High School, though they had already met each other when they were younger. In 2005, west coast rapper Murs signed a deal with Record Collection as an A&R/artist. He then signed Supreeme onto Record Collection's roster. Supreeme won the attention of Murs and Record Collection alike with the release of "Church and State" (2003). Church and State is considered a highly innovative underground album.
Supreeme appeared on Warped Tour in the summer of 2005 with label mates Brother Reade. Supreeme also went on a nationwide tour headlined by Murs in spring 2006. While on the road, their first nationally-distributed album, "Supremacy", was released on April 25, 2006. The song "Supply and Demand", off of "Supremacy" featuring J Young, was a favorite amongst bloggers and fans, and the album got a string of favorable reviews. The album was underpromoted by the label, and sales were tepid, though they continue to enjoy a slow burn mostly via internet.
In 2007 the trio was up-streamed to parent label Warner Bros. Records. Their new album "Gold Medallion" has already been recorded and is to be released on Warner Bros. Records, though the release date has yet to be announced. In promotion of "Gold Medallion" and in commemoration of their five-year anniversary as a group, they released "Bronze Medallion: Best of Supreeme 2003-2008" in the spring of 2008. In August 2008, Supreeme released their music video for "I'm Crazy" the single from their latest album "Silver Medallion" which came out on September 12, 2008. The music video was produced and directed by DJ Bernstein Bear.
The group disbanded at the end of 2009 with their final release "God Bless The Child". Their entire discography has been made available online as free downloads.
Influences.
Each member of the group has at least one parent from outside the United States, which might explain some of the cultural references made in their songs as well as some of their sonic influences. Reggae and specifically Dancehall has a large presence in Tom Cruz's production who is a Jamerican. In a 2007 interview, when asked about the "internationality" in Supreeme's music, Girvan explains, "...growing up with my father, I grew up in reggae, there was always Reggae playing in the house".

Voter turnout was 86.4%.
The Stockholm Party was founded in this year, and was allocated three seats in this election, marking the first time a party entered or exited the Stockholm City Council since the Centre Party earned their first mandate in 1966.

California dial

In watch-making, or horology, a California dial refers to a clock face that consists of half Roman (usually 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock) and half Arabic numerals (usually 4 o'clock to 8 o'clock). Sometimes the hours of 3, 6, and 9 are replaced with a dash instead of a numeral and an inverted triangle in place of the 12. The use of this dial style dates back to the 1930s, for example in early Rolexes, Marina Militare and Kampfschwimmer diver's watches. A number of Rolexes were refurbished by a company based in California using this style of dial, and resulting in the name "California dial".

Worcester Center Galleria

The Worcester Center Galleria, located in Downtown Worcester, Massachusetts, was a two level shopping mall which originally opened on July 29, 1971 as a part of the Worcester Center urban renewal project. The mall, which connected the 100 Front Street and 120 Front Street office towers, was successful for 20 years until it closed following a series of store vacancies. The mall re-opened in 1994 as a short-lived outlet center called Worcester Common Fashion Outlets, finally closing in 2006. The mall is currently undergoing demolition and re-development into a project called CitySquare.
History.
1971–1993: Beginnings.
The Worcester Center Galleria opened on July 29, 1971. To be built, a large swath of Worcester's downtown was demolished to make room for the mall and two connected skyscrapers (100 Front Street and 120 Front Street). The Galleria had a large open area with an arched roof that was supposedly modeled after the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, Italy. The design for the mall also included a 4,300-space parking garage, which, at the time, was the largest parking structure in the world. Two construction experts from New York and California had called the original mall "the finest shopping center they had ever seen in the United States." The original anchor stores included Filene's, Jordan Marsh, and Kennedy's. By the late 1980s, two of the major anchors, Filene's and Jordan Marsh, had moved out, while other area malls such as the Auburn Mall and Greendale Mall began drawing away customers.
1994–2003: Revitalization.
In 1994, Worcester Center Associates sold the Galleria to New England Development which slowly shut down the remaining stores with plans to revitalize the mall. On October 29, 1994, the Galleria reopened as the Worcester Common Fashion Outlets, with Judith Light taking the role of spokesperson, appearing in a large publicity campaign for the mall. With the reopening, there were drastic changes to the stores housed in the mall and the look and layout of it. The original anchors were gone and replaced with Sports Authority, Bed Bath and Beyond, Saks Off Fifth Avenue Outlet, Media Play, and Filene's Basement (later VF Factory Outlet). After the re-opening, the mall contained a total of 126 outlet stores.
As time went on, this re-marketing of the mall did not help. In 1996 the name was changed another time to simply Worcester Common Outlets, and in 1997, a larger outlet mall, the Wrentham Village Premium Outlets, opened off nearby Interstate 495 in Wrentham, Massachusetts drawing from the Common Outlets' customer base.
2004–present: Closure and redevelopment.
Business at the mall slowly died down until June 22, 2004, when Berkeley Investments, along with its capital partner, Starwood Capital of Greenwich, Connecticut announced that they would buy the Worcester Common Outlets. After the announcement of the acquisition, leases in the mall were not renewed and it slowly emptied. The mall closed for good in April 2006. Berkeley has demolished a large portion of the mall and has begun construction of a mixed-use development named CitySquare where a combination of retail, housing and office space will replace the mall. Berkeley Investments planned on keeping the parking garages and Worcester Foothills Theatre, which called a section of the basement of the mall home, until it suspended operations on May 10, 2009 due to lack of funding.
The project is an example of transit oriented development because of its proximity to public transportation.
The $563 million project to construct CitySquare stalled for years as Berkeley Investments struggled to secure tenants. The first phase of the project received city approval in May 2008. In March 2009, it was announced that Unum Group, an insurance company, would lease more than in the future CitySquare development. This allowed $25 million in state demolition funding to flow. On September 13, 2010, demolition of portions of the former mall started and on May 18, 2011, visible exterior demolition began.

Jimmy Coates

Jimmy Coates is a series of children's books written by the English author Joe Craig. The books have been published in many countries around the world and will be widely available in the United States for the first time in 2013.
The books are mostly set in the fictional dictatorship of the "Neo-Democratic State of Great Britain".
USA release.
Shortly after the UK publication, Craig's first book was released in the United States under the title "Jimmy Coates: Assassin" but withdrawn shortly afterwards. During its short release it was selected for, among others, the Lone Star reading list in Texas and the New York Public Libraries 'Books for the Teen Age' list.
The whole series will be released for the first time in the USA in 2014.
Critical reception.
The books received a variety of reviews, all positive. The Independent described the first book as
"Few books have the power to drag young boys away from their Xbox or Wii but I've seen the Jimmy Coates series in action – Super Mario is no match for this schoolboy assassin." 
It was described by School Library Association as
"Packed full of shocks and surprises, high-octane action sequences, constant dangers and near-miss escapes from death, this is an at-a-sitting read for Bond and Rider fans everywhere. With bags of film potential..." 
It was a finalist for the 2006 Manchester Book Award, and won the Bolton Children's Book Award 2006.

The Richard Wagner Foundation (in German Richard-Wagner-Stiftung) was formed in 1973, when, faced with overwhelming criticism and Wagner family infighting, the Bayreuth Festival and its assets were transferred to the newly created Foundation. The board of directors included members of the Wagner family and others appointed by the state.
The Wagner family handed over the Festspielhaus and the Richard Wagner Archive to the Foundation and donated Wagner's villa Wahnfried to the town of Bayreuth. In 1976 the National Archive of the Richard Wagner Foundation (formerly known as the Richard Wagner Family Archive or Wahnfried Archive), was deposited with the Foundation.
In 2008 the Foundation's 24 board members, mostly descendants of composer Richard Wagner, selected Katharina Wagner and her sister Eva Wagner-Pasquier to lead the Bayreuth Festival following the decision of Wolfgang Wagner to stand down.

Hunger marches

Hunger marches are a form of social protest that arose in the United Kingdom during the early 20th century. Often the marches involved groups of men and women walking from areas with high unemployment, to London where they would protest outside parliament. Sometimes they would march instead to the offices of regional authorities in cities closer to home. Protesters would try to make the point that lack of work meant they were unable to buy sufficient food to prevent themselves and their families suffering hunger. The first such march took place in 1905. The term "hunger march" was coined three years later in 1908. In the first two decades of the 20th century, there was relatively little unemployment in the UK, but it could still become a severe problem in various areas after disruptive changes to the local economy. Hunger marches became much more prominent in the 1920s and 30s during the Great Depression in the United Kingdom.
During the worldwide Great depression of the 1930s, hunger marches also began to appear in other countries such as Canada. Many of the UK hunger marches were supported by the British wing of the Communist party. While communism was at this time far more respectable than it was to become after the Cold War, this still caused authorities to often regard hunger marches with hostility. The marches were often brutally oppressed, and by the late 20th century had been mostly forgotten. An exception is the Jarrow crusade. This march had less than five hundred participants, with religious rather than political overtones. It did not provoke a hostile response from the authorities and was therefore non violent. Michael Portillo has said this caused the Jarrow march to be well regarded and remembered, in contrast to the other marches which often had tens of thousands of participants and had a greater impact.
In the decades that followed WWII, there was much less unemployment in the UK and throughout the industrialized world, due in part to the Keynesian revolution. Even those without work or savings found it easier to feed themselves, due to the establishment of the welfare state. As a result, hunger marches were no longer needed. There were incidences where thousands of people embarked on marches to draw attention to hunger in the developing world, as happened for example during the 1973 Ethiopian famine, but the term "hunger march" was not often used to describe these events.

Initially, Marshall was connected with some of the early Needed Truth Brethren, but could not go on with them over disagreements regarding what is a legitimate breaking of bread meeting. Marshall insisted that any gathering of two or three believers to break bread could be recognized as an assembly around the Lord's Table.
Marshall spent much time preaching with other pioneers like Donald Ross and Donald Munro. These men who worked together are sometimes considered to be the beginnings of the Gospel Hall Brethren.

French frigate Amélie (1808)

Amélie was a 46-gun "Pallas" class frigate of the French Navy.
On 21 October 1809, she sailed from Toulon to escort a convoy bound for Barcelona. Chased by a British squadron under Collingwood, she joined up with "Pauline" and "Borée" and managed to reach Toulon.
On 29 March 1811, she departed Toulon with "Adrienne", escorting the storeship "Dromadaire" carrying 8 tonnes of gunpowder and ammunition to Corfu. Two days later, the ships ran across a British squadron comprising HMS "Unite" and HMS "Ajax". "Dromadaire" was captured, while the frigates managed to escape to Portoferraio.
At the Bourbon Restauration, she was renamed to "Junon", effective from 11 April 1814.
She served during the Spanish expedition under Captain Rosamel, capturing a privateer on 3 March 1823 and fighting off Barcelona.
She served as a transport in Madagascar, then was re-armed in the Mediterranean, before being struck in 1842.

Weak coloring

The figure on the right shows a weak 2-coloring of a graph. Each dark vertex (color 1) is adjacent to at least one light vertex (color 2) and vice versa.
Properties.
A graph vertex coloring is a weak coloring, but not necessarily vice versa.
Every graph has a weak 2-coloring. The figure on the right illustrates a simple algorithm for constructing a weak 2-coloring in an arbitrary graph. Part (a) shows the original graph. Part (b) shows a breadth-first search tree of the same graph. Part (c) shows how to color the tree: starting from the root, the layers of the tree are colored alternatingly with colors 1 (dark) and 2 (light).
If there is no isolated vertex in the graph , then a weak 2-coloring determines a domatic partition: the set of the nodes with is a dominating set, and the set of the nodes with is another dominating set.
Applications.
Historically, weak coloring served as the first non-trivial example of a graph problem that can be solved with a local algorithm (a distributed algorithm that runs in a constant number of synchronous communication rounds). More precisely, if the degree of each node is odd and bounded by a constant, then there is a constant-time distributed algorithm for weak 2-coloring.
This is different from (non-weak) vertex coloring: there is no constant-time distributed algorithm for vertex coloring; the best possible algorithms (for finding a minimal but not necessarily minimum coloring) require communication rounds. Here is the iterated logarithm of .

Liquidation Channel

Headquartered in Austin, TX, The Jewelry Channel, Inc., d/b/a Liquidation Channel, is a 24/7 home shopping and ecommerce business. With a more than 80 million household reach, Liquidation Channel is one of the fastest growing Jewelry and Lifestyle retail business in the US. Liquidation Channel is part of the Vaibhav Global Limited (VGL Group). The company mines and handcrafts many of the products sold on its TV networks.
History.
The predecessor to the Liquidation Channel, The Jewelry Channel, was an American home shopping channel that specialized in the sale of jewelry, in the manner of a reverse auction format. Based in Austin, Texas, the channel initially began broadcasting on DirecTV, soon adding Dish Network and small- to medium-sized cable markets. The channel could also be viewed in a live streaming format on the company's official website.
LC began broadcasting in the Vancouver/Victoria market on Victoria station CHEK-DT on Monday, June 25. This is the channel’s first broadcast into Canada. The broadcast is Sunday through Friday from 12am – 6am, and Saturday from 2am – 6am. The company is very pleased with initial performance, and hopes to expand their presence in Canada even further. Happening around the same time as the Canadian broadcast, the company has updated their studio look, revealing a new design just in time for the 4th of July. The design includes a complete new look that will reflect the latest in style, a much sharper background, new lighting, and a setting that will allow better interaction with Viewers. 
All of these improvements have been made possible by the growth of the company and the expanded customer base they have achieved in the last 2 years. To support this progress, the company employee group has also grown from 58 employees at the end of 2009 to over 500 current employees. LC has also just begun the 5th expansion of its warehouse. As all of this growth happens within the company’s Austin, TX headquarters, they have also added a new benefit, the Hope Scholarship, to employees. This scholarship will be awarded to 12 employees’ children each year to help fund their college educations.
It was reported on the Austin American-Statesman web site on June 16, 2008 that TJC would close its doors and cease broadcasting in early August 2008, with its staff of 106 employees being laid off. Although the network went off-air in early December 2008, a new network began broadcasting on the same day in its place. Presenter Dan Dennis, along with presenter Sayed Haider, provided information on the evening of November 30, 2008 that this new channel would be called the "Liquidation Channel", or LC for short. Essentially, all of TJC's jewelry had to be sold as this new network would have a new lot of jewelry, with all of the unsold TJC jewelry being shipped to its sister networks in the UK and Germany. Dennis went on to point out that there were "entirely new computers and databases marked with 'LC'" ready for use with the Liquidation Channel and that this channel would feature "jewelry, accessories, and many other products". It was implied that many of TJC's talent would be featured on the new network.
The Liquidation Channel succeeded The Jewelry Channel on December 1, 2008 at 1:00AM ET. The first official auction began at 5:05PM Eastern Time after over 16 hours of a promotional loop.
The Jewelry Channel USA has overseas versions of their channel in the United Kingdom (The Jewellery Channel) and Germany (Der Schmuckkanal) that are still active.
LC features many of the same music, graphics, and sound effects that were featured on The Jewelry Channel.
Format.
LC operates in a reverse auction format. The channel will feature an item, and show a starting price and quantity available. They will then drop that amount down to the Liquidation Channel price. Occasionally the price will continue to drop down even more, depending on the item. In some instances, additional quantities of an item may be added, if more of the specific item are discovered in the inventory.
The host will continue to talk about the item, mentioning various aspects of the item such as size, gemstone, and other important information (such as additional sizes, stone cut, carat size, etc.) during which time a countdown clock runs (on the right side of the screen) and the quantity decreases as items are sold. If the item sells out before the clock expires, LC goes to the next item.
The price shown does not include shipping and handling charges. Shipping and Handling charges are determined by the day of sale or any special deals being offered. Shipping charges can range from $1.99 to $2.99 depending on the day the item is sold, and if any specials are being offered (such as a Free Shipping Offers), it is shown on the screen during the broadcast. As the company is based in Austin, Texas residents will also have to pay state sales tax for any items purchased (tax is charged on both the item price and the shipping charge).
Liquidation Channel is an All Sales Final company for items sold at less than $200 & are non-returnable. Occasionally LC will designate some items as returnable, and those items will display that in the item description (located in the lower right side of the screen). Returnable items have a 14 day window in order to return an item.

Denver 2008 Convention Host Committee

The Denver 2008 Convention Host Committee is a non-profit organization that was responsible for private funding of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado on August 25–28, 2008. In addition to securing sponsors, other obligations included organizing a volunteer base, managing a vendor database, coordinating local events, providing hospitality to delegates and credentialed media, and promoting tourism in Denver, Colorado and the Western U.S.
As the fundraising arm of the convention, the Host Committee had four contractual partners: the Democratic National Convention Committee, which was responsible for logistics of convention activities within Pepsi Center; the City and County of Denver, which provided security, traffic management, and operational support; Kroenke Sports, owner of Pepsi Center arena where the convention was held; and its own Executive Committee.
Executive Committee Members.
The following individuals are listed on the inside cover of the "Official 2008 Democratic National Convention Visitors Guide", produced by the Denver Metro Convention & Visitors Bureau.
Host Committee Members.
The following individuals are listed on page 10 of the "Official 2008 Democratic National Convention Visitors Guide", produced by the Denver Metro Convention & Visitors Bureau.
Economic Impact.
During the convention, more than 50,000 visitors came to Denver, including more than 16,000 members of the media, bloggers, and independent journalists. Early projections estimated an economic impact of $160–$200 million; however a final report released on October 16, 2008 by Denver Mayor John W. Hickenlooper put the official estimate at a $266.1 million regional economic benefit to the Denver metro region, of which $153.9 million occurred directly within the City and County of Denver.
Convention Greening.
One mission of the 2008 Denver Convention Host Committee was to ensure that the 2008 Democratic National Convention set a new standard for green conventions whereby sustainability and environmental health concerns are factored into the event planning. The Host Committee led this effort by setting green standards for events, completing environmental improvements at city facilities, setting up recycling areas, partnering with local restaurants and venues for healthy options, and encouraging the use of carbon offsets.
Fundraising Targets.
On October 16, 2008, the Denver 2008 Convention Host Committee announced that it generated just over $55 million in cash contributions and $5.46 million of in-kind support. The balance of the $60.9 million came from interest income and miscellaneous refunds. That surpassed the Host Committee's original $40 million contractual target by more than $20 million. In a 1,400-page Federal Election Commission report, the Host Committee detailed financial and in-kind contributions from more than 700 businesses and individuals. Security-related expenses, not detailed in the report, were covered separately by a $50 million federal grant.
Volunteers.
An estimated 15,000 volunteers answered telephone calls, collated mailings, prepared and distributed convention materials, assisted at media and public events, and even collected and sorted trash at waste recovery stations for recycling and composting.

Biography.
Paul Fitzgerald and Elizabeth Gould began working together in 1979 co-producing a documentary for Paul's television show, "Watchworks". In the spring of 1981, they were the first American TV crew to acquire visas to enter Afghanistan. Following their news story for the "CBS Evening News", they produced a documentary ("Afghanistan Between Three Worlds") for PBS and in 1983 they returned to Kabul for "ABC Nightline". As the first American journalists to get deeply inside the story they not only got a view of an unseen Afghan life, but a revelatory look at how the US defined itself against the rest of the world under the veil of superpower confrontation. At the time of the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, Paul and Liz were working on the film version of their experience under contract to Oliver Stone. During the research for the screenplay many of the documents preceding the Afghan crisis were declassified. As the horrors of the Taliban regime began to grab headlines in 1998 Paul and Liz began collaborating with Afghan human rights expert Sima Wali. Along with Wali, they contributed to the "Women for Afghan Women: Shattering Myths and Claiming the Future" book project. In 2002 they filmed Wali's first return to Kabul since her exile in 1978. They produced a film about Wali's journey home, "The Woman in Exile Returns". Fitzgerald and Gould currently live in Boston, Massachusetts.

<doc id="20505423" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20505423" title="Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985">
Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985

The Bhutanese Citizenship Act of 1985 was introduced by the Druk Gyalpo King King Wangchuck, on June 10, 1985, modifying the definition of a Bhutanese citizen. The Act was implemented as part of a new national policy of "Driglam Namzha", national customs and etiquette. Because of its emphasis on Bhutanese culture, the Act is also referred to as the "One Nation, One People Act." The 1985 Act was amended by the Immigration Act of 2007 and then superseded in 2008 by the Constitution of Bhutan insofar as previous laws are inconsistent; where not inconsistent, the provisions of the 2007 Act, the 1985 Act, and previous Acts relating to immigration continue in effect.
Provisions of the Citizenship Act of 1985.
The first article of the Act provides its name, its date of enactment, and that it supersedes any conflicting prior laws relating to citizenship. Namely, this Act superseded the Citizenship act of 1958 and Amendments of 1977.
Citizenship by birth and by registration.
The second article of the Act provides Bhutanese citizenship to those whose parents are "both" Bhutanese citizens. (Cf. the 1958 Act which required only that one's father be Bhutanese) This article is an example of a "jus sanguinis", or blood-based, nationality law. The article guarantees citizenship to children of two Bhutanese nationals as a matter of right.
The third article of the Act provides for citizenship by registration. It provides Bhutanese citizenship for persons who show that they were "permanently domiciled" in Bhutan by December 31, 1958, and that their name was registered in the yearly Census Register. The article guarantees citizenship by registration as a matter of right to those who meet the permanent domicile and census registration requirements.
Naturalization.
The fourth article of the Act provides a substantive and procedural framework for naturalization. It requires applicants to submit application forms (forms KA-1 and KA-2, requesting general biographic and biometric information) and sets forth the conditions of eligibility for naturalization. Applicants with one Bhutanese parent must be at least 15 years of age and must have resided in Bhutan at least 15 years as indicated in the census register. Non-Bhutanese applicants must be at least 21 years of age and must have resided in Bhutan for at least 20 years as indicated in the census register, except government employees who need show a 15 year residency. (Cf. the 1958 Act which required only 10 year residency for all naturalization) All applicants must demonstrate soundness of mind; the ability to speak, read, and write Dzongkha proficiently; good knowledge of the culture, customs, traditions, and history of Bhutan; good moral character without any record of imprisonment for criminal offenses in Bhutan or elsewhere; no record of having spoken or acted against the King, country or people of Bhutan in any manner whatsoever; and preparedness to take a solemn oath of allegiance to the King, country and people of Bhutan. (Cf. the 1958 Act which made no official cultural requirements)
Once an applicant's forms are submitted, the Ministry of Home Affairs conducts written and oral tests to assess applicants' proficiency in Dzongkha and knowledge of the culture, customs, tradition and history of Bhutan. The decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs on the question of eligibility for naturalization is stated as "final and binding". The government also reserves the right "to reject any application for naturalization without assigning any reason."
The fifth article of the Act requires applicants who have been favorably considered to take an oath of allegiance, with naturalization complete upon receipt of a Kashog from the King.
Deprivation of citizenship.
The sixth article of the Act concerns termination of citizenship. It provides that Bhutanese citizens who acquire foreign citizenship cease to be citizens of Bhutan. The spouse and children of such persons – if themselves Bhutanese citizens – have the right to remain as citizens provided they are permanently domiciled in Bhutan and are registered annually in the Citizenship Register maintained by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
It also provides that the government may deprive naturalized Bhutanese citizens of their citizenship at any time if it finds that naturalization had been obtained by means of fraud, false representation, or the concealment of any material fact.
It also provides that the government may deprive naturalized Bhutanese citizens of their citizenship at any time if it finds that person has shown by act or speech to be disloyal in any manner whatsoever to the King, country or people of Bhutan.
Furthermore, it provides that children of two Bhutanese parents may lose their citizenship if their names are also not recorded in the Citizenship register maintained in the Ministry of Home Affairs, having left Bhutan voluntarily and without the knowledge of the government. (Resolution No. 16 (2) adopted by the National Assembly of Bhutan in its 62nd Session).
Finally, the sixth article provides that when the government deprives Bhutanese of their citizenship, they must dispose of all immovable property in Bhutan within one year, failing which, the property is confiscated by the Ministry of Home Affairs on payment of fair and reasonable compensation.
Implementation of the Act of 1985.
The first nationwide census was implemented from 1988. The largest group within the country affected by the enforcement were the Lhotshampa people; this group, a generalized term for those of Nepalese descent, comprised 43% of the total population of Bhutan in 1988 including all illegal aliens. Bhutanese security forces moved through the southern regions of the country, home to most of the Lhotshampas, forcing them from their homes and across the southern borders into Nepal. Because most of the people exiled did not speak Dzongkha, they were classified as illegal aliens, thus able to be removed from the country. In total, between 100,000 and 150,000, 1/6 of Bhutan's population in 1988, ended up in Nepal.
Nepal lacked adequate resources to independently deal with the inflow of refugees resultant of the citizenship act. With help from the United Nations, seven refugee camps were established in Nepal, within which 97% of occupants were Lhotshampas from Bhutan. Conflict arose between the two countries when the government of Bhutan would not admit liability for the situation, claiming that all the people in question were Nepalese citizens and thus for Nepal to handle.
External aid, provided by other governments besides that of Nepal, provides subsistence for the majority of refugees. Furthermore several countries, including the United States and Canada, agreed to resettle a percent of the Lhotshampas who had UNHCR refugee status.
In 2003, an agreement was reached between Bhutan and Nepal, allowing for Bhutanese refugees still remaining in Nepal to return home with full rights of citizenship. However, this has gone largely unnoticed due to shifts occurring with Bhutan's political makeup. The century's old monarchical country, beginning with King Wangchuck's abdication in 2006 and his son's taking over of the throne, is transitioning to a constitutional monarchy and democratic state. Amidst this ordered chaos, the status of the Lhotshampas has been pushed further back on the political agenda.
Provisions of the Immigration Act of 2007.
The Immigration Act of 2007 amends and supplements the Citizenship Act of 1985. It was enacted by Parliament on January 5, 2007, and came into effect on February 20, 2007. It established a Department of Immigration under the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs to implement and administer its provisions through immigration offices. It endowed immigration officers of the Department of Immigration with both police and prosecution powers. Immigration officers were also delegated immigrations and customs enforcement powers: they were accorded the right to enter any private or official premises in order to search, arrest, seize, detain, interrogate or to demand forfeiture of any vehicles, trains, vessels, aircraft, or goods in accordance with the laws. Immigration officers were immunized from all wrongful acts or omissions committed in good faith in the discharge of their duties. Along with immigration officers, the Royal Court of Justice is specifically provided powers to enforce the Act. Rulemaking and regulatory authority is vested in the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs regarding any matter for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Act.
Immigration categories.
The Act of 2007 divides aliens into two categories: immigrants and non-immigrants. Immigrants, in turn, are divided into five categories: women married to Bhutanese men and who hold a Special Residence Permit; the children of Bhutanese women married to foreign men, who hold a Special Residence Permit; those married to a Bhutanese citizen, or the children of such parentage, who holds an Immigration Card; holders of green cards or refugee cards; and holders of Trader Cards.
The first two categories of immigrants, who hold Special Residence Permits, are allowed free movement and residence within Bhutan. Green Card or Refugee Card holders are permitted to stay until such time as may be decided by the Government, but may similarly move freely within Bhutan. Those holding an Immigration Card are provided with stay permit on a periodical basis as decided by the government and must register their residence and obtain route permits to travel outside designated areas. Holders of Trader Cards are permitted to stay and conduct business in designated commercial centers, and must obtain route permits for movement outside their designated place of residence.
Employment visas may not be issued to an immigrant until the consular officer receives a determination made by the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs.
Non-immigrants lack intent to immigrate, and may therefore stay in Bhutan for a maximum of three years. Generally, two types of employment visas are allowed for non-immigrants: visas for "highly skilled, professional and technical experts;" and visas for "skilled and technical workers." Foreign unskilled labor is illegal under the Act. 
The Department maintains a record of each immigrant and non-immigrant within Bhutan.
Admissibility.
Admissibility requirements are set forth depending on the type of alien. Visitors, visitors in transit, students, skilled workers, overseas employees, foreign airline employees, and businesspersons all have different requirements for admissibility. Most often, these differences are in duration, intent (not) to work, and intent (not) to immigrate. 
Inadmissibility for entry is also defined in the Act. One who is under order of deportation or exclusion or fails to produce proper travel or medical documents or other proof as required by an immigration officer. One may also be found inadmissible based foreign policy, national security, poor health, or criminal record. Intending to proselytize or otherwise disrupt Bhutanese culture also makes one inadmissible. Gaining entry into Bhutan illegally, through fraud, deception, or material omission are also grounds for inadmissibility; entry through points other than designated ports is deemed an illegal immigrant regardless of being otherwise admissible or holding a visa.
For all aliens, registration is required to maintain status. These records are confidential.
Visas.
The Act of 2007 also provides four categories of visas: diplomatic visas; official visas; ordinary/tourist visas; and gratis visas. Visas may authorize single, double, triple, or multiple entries into Bhutan. Visa fees are also authorized.
Diplomatic visas are for ambassadors, high-level government representatives, reigning royalty, and representatives of international organizations. Official visas are for other official guests and professionals working internationally, including business visitors seeking to attend Government-sponsored symposia and conferences. Ordinary visas are for tourists, private visitors, businesspersons, journalists, consultants, and other qualified professionals. Gratis visas categories are not described by the Act. Other categories of visa mentioned but not enumerated include business, transit, and student visas.
Diplomatic, official, and gratis visas are valid for a maximum of ninety days after entry; ordinary visas are valid for thirty days after entry. Tourist visas are allowed a maximum of ninety days. Foreign workers are issued visas with validity depending upon the terms of their assignment. Business visas are issued for one year or more with multiple entries. Student visas are issued for the duration of the academic course or for five years, whichever is less, on the basis of firm letters of admission from an academic institution recognized by the government. Transit visas are issued for a maximum of forty-eight hours with single entry facility only.
Extension on visas may be granted only on grounds of illness as an exceptional case, not to exceed 15 days at a time. However, no extension is possible for those who fail to register properly.
Inspection, detention, and removal.
The Act of 2007 provides for the inspection of all foreigners seeking admission into Bhutan. It also provides for spot checking in public and "regular field inspections in "all residential, commercial, private" and official premises to expose illegal immigrants and unauthorized foreign workers." During inspection, permission to enter may be suspended.
The Act of 2007 also provides a substantive and procedural framework for the detention and removal of foreigners from Bhutan. The Department may, for reasonable and sufficient cause, cancel or revoke permission to be present. The burden falls on the applicant to prove eligibility for admission or remaining in Bhutan. Removal proceedings for those who enter illegally or remain unlawfully begin with notice from the Department. Aliens are allowed to depart voluntarily within fifteen days so long as they establish they have not been involved in any criminal activities; have no financial dues payable; have means to depart, by clear and convincing evidence; intend to depart; and have no court cases pending. Those who have broken the law are subject to detention for the duration of removal proceedings. The costs of removal are to be born by the parties who bring the foreigners into Bhutan.
Immigration-related offences.
The Act of 2007 criminalizes refusal to register, deception, and obstruction of immigration authorities by anyone. The Act also makes it a felony to hire, transport, harbor, or furnish illegal or inadmissible immigrants with improper documentation. Falsely representing oneself as Bhutanese to receive benefits is a misdemeanor, as are misrepresentations in pursuit of a visa and concealing the presence of unauthorized persons. The Act provides strict liability for those who bring unauthorized foreigners into Bhutan despite whatever due diligence they may have exercised. Knowingly or willfully doing so, however, is a fourth degree felony, along with transporting those foreigners within Bhutan and tampering with travel documents. Creating false travel records, as well as falsifying authorization, are third degree felonies. Fines and other penalties are meted according to the Penal Code as well as regulations under it and the Act of 2007.
Miscellaneous section.
The Act of 2007 sets forth obligations for Bhutanese agencies and individuals as well as foreigners. Hoteliers, tour operators, contractors, employers of foreign workers, and all other individuals are bound "to consciously adhere to and apply the provisions" of the Act. All employers and managers of hotels of agencies, as well as Bhutanese doing business with foreigners, have an affirmative duty to maintain records to be produced to immigration officers on request for periodical examination. 
Foreigners must abide Bhutanese laws and respect the social norms, tradition, customs, culture and religion of Bhutan. They have the right to be protected by the laws of the Bhutan.

Filthy Dukes

Filthy Dukes are a synthpop band from London, England. The band is composed of Olly Dixon (sampling, electronic percussion, electric guitar), Tim Lawton (synthesisers, lead vocalist) and Mark Ralph (bass guitar, backing vocals). Having been active since 2005, the band released their debut single "Tupac Robot Club Rock" on Fiction Records. The track features vocals by Philadelphian rap group Plastic Little. Their debut album, "Nonsense in the Dark", was released on Monday 16 March 2009 with the track Messages receiving a lot of airplay. It was later released as a single.
Band history.
The group began as Olly Dixon and Tim Lawton working together, where they promoted various club nights and DJ sets. They would go on to play supporting DJ sets for Mylo, Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem, as well as release remixes of bands such as Late of the Pier, The Rakes and The Maccabees. Their music was described as "electroacidhousenuravetwisteddiscopunkfunk". The duo then joined together with long-term producer Mark Ralph to begin playing live. The band have their own resident DJ set, "Kill Em All", which they have been playing for five years. It currently takes place at Fabric.
The band collaborated with Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding on a track for the film "Wild Child", released in August 2008. It is also set to appear on the film's soundtrack. The track sparked rumours that Harding would be leaving Girls Aloud to pursue a solo career, a rumour she later denied.

Ken Shimizu

Life and career.
Shimizu was born on September 1, 1979 and made his first appearance as a gravure model at 18 years old in the July 1998 issue of the Japanese gay men's magazine "Buddy" (Badi). His AV career began shortly afterward and by mid-2002 he was reported to have appeared in over 1200 adult videos.
Shimizu was involved in the V&R Planning video "T.A.B.U. Blonde Hair Girl's Hi-School 2" (t.A.B.u 金髪女学園2), released in July 2005 and directed by Temple Suwa. The story brings two Western (Hungarian) porn stars, Maya Gold and Monica, to Japan to "learn about Japanese culture and society" and incidentally to teach the Japanese boys about sex. He also appeared in the "uncensored" video "Sky Angel 27" starring Seri Iwasaki which was released by Sky High Entertainment in April 2006.
Although Shimizu makes heterosexual adult movies, like fellow AV actor Yoshiya Minami, he is a popular figure in the gay community. He and Minami appear together in a May, 2003 video from V&R Planning, "Ecstasy: Venture" (ECSTASY ～危険な香り～), with actresses Hitomi Shina and Mariko Kawana but in an unusual twist for Japanese porn the video box cover features Shimizu and Minami, not the actresses, and seems pointed toward a female (or gay) audience. In an even more male-oriented project from November 2007 produced by Force Entertainment, "CYBER EXSTASY", he appears in an anthology along with Japanese AV actor Natuya Togawa. The video excerpts scenes from the actors' heterosexual videos but dwells on the male body.
Another possible example of the Japanese AV industry's new interest in women viewers is shown in the 2008 Adult Video Grandprix contest where Shimizu's video "Shimiken's Private 7 FUCK" (しみけんのプライベート7FUCK) won the Best Miscellaneous Video award. The December 2007 video, produced by IdeaPocket and prominently displaying Shimizu clad only in briefs on the cover presents him having sex with seven AV Idols, Chihiro Hara, Mangetsu Sakuragawa, Nene, Kaede Akina, Natsuki Sugisaki, Yua Aida and Marin. A second volume in the series, "Shimiken's Private 7 FUCK 2" (しみけんのプライベート7FUCK 2), which also portrays his physique on the video box front cover was released in August 2008.
One of Shimizu's interests is bodybuilding and in 2005 at the 13th Bodybuilding Championships in Tokyo, he placed 6th in the men's 60 kg class.

Grilling of Health Minister Ahmed Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Sabah.
On February 19, 2007, Waleed Al-Tabtabaie submitted a motion to formally question Health Minister Sheik Ahmed Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Sabah about allegations of favoritism, deteriorating health services offered by state hospitals, and wasting public money by sending people for treatment abroad at the country's expense when they could be treated at home. The motion was signed and supported by Al-Omair, Duaij Al-Shimmari, Faisal Al-Muslim Al-Otaib, Hussein Muzyed, Abdullah Okash, Abdullah Al-Azemi, Saad Al-Azemi, Dhaifallah Buramia, Marzouq Al-Hubaini and Mohammad Al-Mutair.
Against Cross-Dressing.
On December 10, 2007, the parliament passed a bill, supported by Al-Omair and Faisal Al-Muslim Al-Otaib, which amended the penal code so that anyone "imitating the appearance of a member of the opposite sex" could be jailed for up to a year or fined up to 1,000 dinars. When NGO Human Rights Watch criticized the law, Al-Omair accused the human rights organisation of luring other nations to practice vice and lewdness in the name of personal freedom. 
To promote cross dressing is not good, but putting someone in jail for a personal option of life, is another crime. Freedom is the most preciated value, Mr. AlOmair should not be in public charge, publics posts should be only for people who care for people
Supported Zakat Law.
In November 2007, the parliament voted 51-2 to approve a law requiring all Kuwaiti public and shareholding companies to pay Zakat every year. Al-Omair was one of the main proponents of the bill.

Resignation of Information Minister Mohammed al-Sanoussi.
On December 17, 2006, Information Minister Mohammed al-Sanoussi resigned, a day before he was scheduled to be questioned in parliament over allegations that he tried to restrict satellite TV stations during this year's legislative elections.
Al-Sanoussi denied he curbed the private TV channels, saying that he only asked them to apply for licenses. In Kuwait, all publications and broadcasting media have to be licensed. Several privately owned satellite stations, operated from abroad, appeared in Kuwait before the June elections, broadcasting interviews with opposition figures and covering the campaign. Most subsequently went off the air.
Al-Muslim led the campaign against Al-Sanoussi, claiming that al-Sanoussi wrote to the Interior Ministry, asking it to find out who owned the new TV stations so that this "sensitive and dangerous" situation could be dealt with. In the written request to question Al-Sanoussi, Al-Muslim said, "What the information minister did was against the principles of freedom, and against the constitution that guarantees freedom of speech, expression and publication." Al-Muslim also accused the minister of failing to suppress publications that were anti-Islamic and promoting vice.

Resignation of Health Minister Maasouma Al-Mubarak.
On August 25, 2007, Al-Otaib and Islamist MP Waleed AlـTabtabaie submitted to Speaker Jassem Al-Kharafi a motion to grill Health Minister Maasouma Al-Mubarak following the August 23rd Jahra Hospital fire which led to the death of two elderly patients. The first angle of the grilling accused Dr Maasouma of committing violations in the Foreign Medical Treatment Department and toying with ministerial law 2007/25 issued by the minister after assuming office. Indicating according to the law only those patients suffering from diseases for which treatment is not available in Kuwait can be sent for treatment abroad according to the recommendation of a specialized panel of doctors and the physicians in charge of the patient, the MPs said in their grilling motion "as per the law the Health Minister and undersecretaries of health cannot interfere in the decision. However, this law was never implemented and was repeatedly violated under the minister's supervision."
Against Cross-Dressing.
On December 10, 2007, the parliament passed a bill, supported by Al-Otaib and Ali Al-Omair, which amended the penal code so that anyone "imitating the appearance of a member of the opposite sex" could be jailed for up to a year or fined up to 1,000 dinars. Al-Otaib, who heads a parliamentary committee monitoring "practices alien to Kuwaiti society", said: "The law criminalising people who imitate the appearance of the opposite sex must be implemented and respected ... Kuwait should ignore any international criticism."

Maternity den

A maternity den, in the animal kingdom, is a lair where the mother gives birth and nurtures the young, when they are in a vulnerable life stage. While such dens are typically subterranean, they may also be snow caves or simply beneath rock ledges. Characteristically there is an entrance, and optionally an exit corridor, in addition to a principal chamber.
Examples.
The Polar Bear, "Ursus maritimus", creates a maternity den either in an earthen subterranean or in a snow cave. On the Hudson Bay Plain in Manitoba, Canada, many of these subterranean dens are situated in the Wapusk National Park, from which bears migrate to the Hudson Bay when the ice pack forms. The maternity den is the organism's shelter for most of the winter. "When all the other polar bears are heading off to the openness of the ocean, the pregnant female polar bears begin looking for a maternity den. This maternity den is usually in a snow bank, or along an ice patch of ocean shore. It is here that the female polar bear will go into a hibernation type state. Female polar bears dig their own maternity den. It is important the female polar bears have fed enough in the spring and summer before fall, because of the scarcity of food on land when winter comes. While in the maternity den, the mother polar bear will not eat, drink or defecate. The female polar bear will stay in the maternity den and give birth to her cubs." 
Pack members may guard the maternity den used by the alpha female; such is the case with the African Wild Dog, "Lycaon pictus".
The Red Fox also creates maternity dens. After mating, foxes make a maternity den for raising their offspring. Most often, the mother and father will find and enlarge an old woodchuck burrow. Sometimes, a hollow log, streambank, rockpile, cave, or dense shrub will play the role as a den.The den is usually chosen at a place where there is raised ground so the foxes can see all around. The main entrance will be approximately three feet wide, and the den will have one or two escape holes.The den is lined with grass and dry leaves.

<doc id="20505614" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20505614" title="Waleed Al-Tabtabaie">
Waleed Al-Tabtabaie

Waleed Al-Tabatabaie (Arabic: وليد الطباطبائي) is a former member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, who represented the third district. Born on 4 April 1964, Al-Tabtabaie obtained a PhD in Islamic studies from Al-Azhar and was an assistant professor at Kuwait University before being elected to the National Assembly in 1996. While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Al-Tabtabaie affiliated with the Islamist deputies.
Socially conservative.
Al-Tabtabaie is politically conservative. He has taken socially conservative stands on several issues pertaining to speech, media, and Westernization.
BBC and Olympic broadcasts.
In September 2000 he criticized the BBC for a radio broadcast which included material about extramarital affairs. The program—part of a series on sex and reproductive health—discussed sexual excitement for men and women and extramarital affairs. Earlier that month Al-Tabtabaie called for some Olympic events to be banned from television because they were indecent.
Westernization.
Al-Tabtabaie is against Westernization. In January 2001 he told the press, "We as Islamic parties oppose the Western behavior in this community, like the women voting and the western concert music that we see... Also we oppose the new Western clothes that have invaded this country and the hairstyles and also the tradition we see among the youth of smoking and drinking liquor." 
In February 2008, Al-Tabtabaie called for the Kuwaiti government to boycott Denmark in response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.
In September 2008, Al-Tabtabaie said he wanted the government to block YouTube to prevent the dissemination of videos that were blasphemous or pornographic.
Al-Tabtabaie has spoken out against the Guantanamo Bay detention center. In 2004 he called for U.S. President George W. Bush to "uncover what is going on inside Guantanamo," allow family visits to the hundreds of Muslim detainees there, and allow an independent investigation of detention conditions.
On May 23, 2004, Al-Tabtabaie pressured the Islamic Affairs ministry to issue a fatwa banning "un-Islamic" concerts with women singers, such as the show Star Academy. Forbidden acts include "women singing to men... mixing between the sexes when women reveal part of their body, and using vulgar words and dancing." 
Star Academy is based on a hit French TV show of the same name in which male and female teenagers from different Arab countries live together before competing in a talent contest.
On May 6, a Star Academy concert was held in Kuwait, despite demonstrations by hundreds of Islamist activists. Al-Tabtabaie further threatened to grill Kuwait's information minister over the matter.
In May 2005, Al-Tabtabaie helped create a constitutional roadblock that effectively killed a measure that would have allowed women to participate in city council elections. The new law which would re-grant Kuwaiti women the right to vote was initially by the National Assembly on April 19, but in accordance with the Kuwaiti constitution it faced a second vote for ratification on May 2. But Parliament ended in deadlock on May 2 when 11 members abstained and 29 voted for it, leaving the legislation just shy of the 11 votes needed. Al-Tabtabai argued, "We have no problem with women voting, but we do have a problem with women standing for elections. Islam dictates that the head of the nation must be a man, and we are technically the head of the nation here." 
On December 14, 2005, Al-Tabtabaie criticized the government for providing Christians with two plots of land to build churches, arguing that "the recent measure of allowing non-Muslims to build places of worship in Kuwait is illegal under Islamic law." Kuwait was the first Gulf Arab state to establish direct links with Vatican City and Emmanuel Benjamen al-Ghareeb became the first Kuwaiti pastor of the Anglican church in 1999.
Redistricting walkout.
On May 15, 2006, Al-Tabtabaie and twenty-eight other MPs walked out of parliament when the cabinet backed a motion to refer a redistricting reform bill to the constitutional court, which effectively meant delaying reforms.
Al-Tabtabaie then urged opposition MPs to sign a reform document pledging to work to slash constituencies to five from the current 25 following the June 29 elections. All 333 candidates for parliament were asked to join the initiative by signing the Reform Charter. Al-Tabtabaie declared that, "The names of supporters will be published in the newspapers for voters to know who backs reform and who doesn't."
Grilling of Health Minister Ahmed Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Sabah.
On February 19, 2007, Al-Tabtabaie submitted a motion to formally question Health Minister Sheik Ahmed Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Sabah about allegations of favoritism, deteriorating health services offered by state hospitals, and wasting public money by sending people for treatment abroad at the country's expense when they could be treated at home. The motion was signed and supported by Ali Al-Omair, Duaij Al-Shimmari, Faisal Al-Muslim Al-Otaib, Hussein Muzyed, Abdullah Okash, Abdullah Al-Azemi, Saad Al-Azemi, Dhaifallah Buramia, Marzouq Al-Hubaini and Mohammad Al-Mutair. 
The minister acknowledged "mistakes were made" and said the standard of health services was not as it should be because health spending has not been a priority for decades. He said the money spent on treatment abroad since 2001—some 260 million dinars (US$902.77 million)--could have been used for building several hospitals.
But Al-Tabtabaie said the minister's comments did not go far enough, and at the end of the 10-hour parliament session, he collected the 10 signatures needed to hold a vote of no confidence.
"What do you mean you referred it to the prosecution? Are you trying to cheat parliament?" Al-Tabtabaie asked the minister. "The official responsible for treatment abroad is still on top of his job." 
Resignation of Health Minister Maasouma Al-Mubarak.
On August 25, 2007, Al-Tabtabaie and MP Faisal Al-Muslim Al-Otaib submitted to Speaker Jassem Al-Kharafi a motion to grill Health Minister Maasouma Al-Mubarak following the August 23rd Jahra Hospital fire which led to the death of two elderly patients. The first angle of the grilling accused Dr Maasouma of committing violations in the Foreign Medical Treatment Department and toying with ministerial law 2007/25 issued by the minister after assuming office. Indicating according to the law only those patients suffering from diseases for which treatment is not available in Kuwait can be sent for treatment abroad according to the recommendation of a specialized panel of doctors and the physicians in charge of the patient, the MPs said in their grilling motion "as per the law the Health Minister and undersecretaries of health cannot interfere in the decision. However, this law was never implemented and was repeatedly violated under the minister's supervision."
Blacklist for those who mistreat foreign workers.
On October 2, 2007, Al-Tabtabaie called for the interior ministry to draw up a blacklist of employers who mistreat their domestic helpers and urged stiff penalties for physical abuse. Al-Tabtabaie said that employers who abuse their maids "physically or morally" should be added to the blacklist and prevented from hiring new maids. Al-Tabtabie, a member of parliament's human rights panel, argued that the phenomenon of maid abuse "has lately increased to a disturbing level and a large number of abuses are committed annually, with most cases failing to reach the court." 
In September 2007, Kuwait opened a temporary shelter to house runaway maids until their disputes with employers are resolved. The Kuwaiti government plans to open two permanent centres for males and females to be housed separately.
Pro-Hijab walkout.
On June 1, 2008, Al-Tabtabaie, Mohammed Hayef AlـMutairi, Jamaan Al-Harbash, and six other MPs walked out of the swearing in ceremony of Modhi al-Homoud and Nouria al-Subeih, two new female Cabinet ministers who were not wearing headscarves.
Law to protect foreign workers.
On August 3, 2008, the parliament passed a bill co-authored by Al-Tabtabaie that stipulates jail terms of up to 15 years for offenses including forced labor, abusing workers or sexually exploiting maids. Al-Tabtabaie told the press that, "We have presented ... a draft law to criminalize human trafficking. It will be a civilized law to meet international demands." 
Opposed guaranteeing bank deposits.
On October 28, 2008, the parliament voted 50–7 to insure all types of deposits in all local banks within Kuwait. Al-Tabtabaie opposed the bill, along with Jabir Al-Azmi, Hussain Al-Qallaf Al-Bahrani, Daifallah Bouramiya, Mohammed Al-Obaid, Mohammed Hayef AlـMutairi, and Musallam AlـBarrak. Al-Tabtabaie accused the Cabinet of speeding up the bill's passage for the benefit of monetary tycoons. He proposed a partial guarantee of KD 100,000 for deposits in local banks.
Request to grill Prime Minister Nasser.
In November 2008, Al-Tabtabaie joined with fellow Islamist MPs Mohammed AlـMutair and Mohammed Hayef AlـMutairi in filing a request to grill Prime Minister Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah for allowing prominent Iranian Shiite cleric Mohammed al-Fali to enter Kuwait despite a legal ban.
Ambitions to be Speaker.
On May 27, 2008, Al-Tabtabaie said that several MPs raised the idea of electing a new speaker other than former speakers Jassem Al-Khorafi and Ahmad Al-Saadoun who are the only candidates. Tabtabai said that he was ready to withdraw from the race if Khorafi also withdrew and MPs agreed on a consensus speaker.
Protest against Israeli attacks.
On December 28, 2008, Kuwaiti lawmakers Mikhled Al-Azmi, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq Al-Ghanim, Jaaman Al-Harbash, Ahmad Al-Mulaifi, Mohammad Hayef Al-Mutairi, Ahmad Al-Saadoun, Nasser Al-Sane, and Waleed Al-Tabtabaie protested in front of the National Assembly building against the attacks by Israel on Gaza. Protesters burned Israeli flags, waved banners reading, "No to hunger, no to submission" and chanted "Allahu Akbar". Israel launched air strikes against Hamas in the Gaza Strip on December 26 after a six-month ceasefire ended on December 18.
