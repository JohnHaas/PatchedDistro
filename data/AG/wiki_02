Scottish Yeomanry

The Scottish Yeomanry (SCOTS YEO) was a Yeomanry Regiment of the British Territorial Army formed in 1992. It served until 1999 when it was amalgamated with the Queen's Own Yeomanry (QOY).
History.
The Scottish Yeomanry was raised on 1 November 1992 as a result of Options for Change with Headquarters at Inchdrewer House, Colinton Road, Edinburgh. It was a Land Rover based reconnaissance regiment with a home defence role. The Regiment consisted of a Headquarters and three Sabre Squadrons.
Headquarters Squadron (Edinburgh) was named for the Lothians and Border Horse Yeomanry and was formed by the re-roling of 225 Squadron, 154 (Lowland) Regiment Royal Corps of Transport.
"A" (Ayrshire (Earl of Carrick's Own) Yeomanry) Squadron (Ayr) was transferred into the new regiment from the QOY where they had been serving on both CVR(W) Fox and other CVR(T) variants.
"B" Squadron (East Kilbride) was named for both The Lanarkshire Yeomanry and The Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry and was formed by the re-roling of 222 Squadron, 154 (Lowland) Regiment Royal Corps of Transport.
"C" Squadron (Cupar) was named for the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry and Scottish Horse and was formed by the re-roling of 239 (Highland Yeomanry) Squadron, 153 (Highland) Regiment Royal Corps of Transport. Until 1999 "C" Squadron also maintained part of the lineage of the Lovat Scouts.
The regiment served in its home defence role with annual exercises in the UK but many of its members also seized on the opportunities opening up to the TA to serve on operational tours in the Balkans.
On 27 June 1998 The Scottish Yeomanry paraded at the Racecourse in Ayr to celebrate the Bicentenary of The Ayrshire Yeomanry. The parade was reviewed by Major General Mark Strudwick, GOC Scotland.
On 1 July 1999, after nearly seven years of service, the Regiment was amalgamated with the QOY as result of the Strategic Defence Review. "A" Squadron returned to the QOY and were joined by "C" Squadron. HQ Squadron was disbanded and its building taken over by the Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming. "B" Squadron was re-roled to become 52 Squadron of 32 (Scottish) Signal Regiment.
Uniform.
The Scottish Yeomanry had a number of distinctive elements to their uniform.
Headdress & Cap badge.
In working dress the regiment wore the grey beret of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. This was also worn by personnel attached from other arms and services such as Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers tradesmen, Royal Logistic Corps Chefs or a Commanding Officer from a regular cavalry Regiment.
The scarlet hussar cap of the Ayrshire Yeomanry was adopted for wear with ceremonial uniforms with subalterns wearing silver peaks, as worn in the QOY, and field officers and above wearing gold peaks as would have been correct for the Ayrshire Yeomanry. 
In "C" Squadron a red-white-green diced balmoral bonnet with cock feather was often worn in place of the scarlet cap.
The cap badge of the regiment consisted of the Lion Rampant of Scotland upon crossed lances under the Scottish Crown. It was the only British Army cap badge, at the time, to show the Scottish Crown. The cap badge of the new Royal Regiment of Scotland is very similar. 
Upon establishment of the Regiment the "Mailed Fist" badge of the Royal Armoured Corps was worn which was superseded by cloth patch badges bearing the new Regiment's approved badge. Metal badges arrived later and were worn on a black cloth backing on the grey beret, and without backing on No 1 and No 2 Dress caps. Officers wore wire embroidered badges on their berets and side-caps, and the metal badge on No 1 and No 2 Dress caps.
Ceremonial uniforms.
The ceremonial uniforms ( and Dress) were based upon Ayrshire Yeomanry patterns with individual Squadron distinctions such as collar badges. B Squadron only wore the collar badges of the Lanarkshire Yeomanry with every squadron wearing buttons with the badge of The Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry in order to represent that regiment's history.
There were initially no specific collar badges for Regimental Staff such as the Honorary Colonel or a TA Commanding Officer and they continued to wear the accoutrements of their own Squadrons. Lieutenant General Sir Norman Arthur, a regular officer of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, wore the collar badges of the Headquarters Squadron (Lothians & Border Horse) whilst he was Honorary Colonel. Subsequently small, inwards facing, variants of the capbadge were produced as collar badges, in metal for No 2 Dress and in wire embroidery on a scarlet backing for No 1 Dress and Mess Kit.
Mess Kit in the patterns of the predecessor regiments could be worn but the accepted pattern was again that of the Ayrshire Yeomanry, with each squadron wearing distinctive embroidered collar badges (Gold Griffon's head on scarlet for A Sqn, Lanarkshire Eagle on scarlet for B Sqn, FFY/SH on scarlet for C Sqn, and Wheatsheaf on French Grey for HQ Sqn).
In No 1 Dress a shoulder belt was produced for officers in gold thistle lace, which was a copy of the Glasgow Yeomanry pattern. The Pouch was based on the Ayrshire Yeomanry pattern and was embroidered in gold and silver wire on a scarlet backing, the "AY" cypher being replaced by "SYC" 
This basis of uniform upon the Ayrshire Yeomanry made the Scottish Yeomanry a "Gold Regiment" in that its accoutrements and lace were gold and not silver as is normally the case with Yeomanry regiments.
Officer's Rank Insignia.
In officers rank insignia were embroidered onto a yellow background with the regimental title also embroidered in yellow.
Stable Belt.
The regimental stable belt which was adopted was a reversed version of the Ayrshire Yeomanry belt. This was the colour of the 15th/19th The King's Royal Hussars' belts and with their pending amalgamation a ready stock was available.
Tartan.
Through their service as Scottish Infantry Battalions in the First World War each of the Squadrons could claim the rights to a Regimental tartan; Hunting Erskine tartan from the Royal Scots Fusiliers for the Ayrshire and Lanarkshire Yeomanries, Mackenzie of Seaforth tartan from the Highland Light Infantry for the Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry and Government tartan from the Black Watch for the Fife & Forfar Yeomanry. After the Second World War, in recognition of the strong links between them and the Royal Scots Greys, the Ayrshire Yeomanry's pipers wore Royal Stewart tartan, a prvilege confirmed by HRH the Duke of Rothesay (Earl of Carrick). However the Scottish Horse had a direct claim to the Murray of Atholl tartan, through their historic linkage with the Dukes of Atholl, and this became the regimental tartan. As a Cavalry Regiment there would be little opportunity to wear tartan in uniform but a patch of Murray of Atholl tartan was often worn on the upper arm of combat dress in a precursor of today's TRFs.
Memorials.
Scottish National War Memorial, which was built after a proposal in 1917 by the 8th Duke of Atholl in Edinburgh Castle contains a memorial and book of remembrance to all Scottish Yeomanry's antecedent Regiments.
Affiliated Cadets.
Now the Scottish Yeomanry's name is only continued by the Army Cadet Force. Two detachments of Inkerman Company, Girvan and Belmont wear the beret of the regiment.

Kalamazoo Superfund Site

In 1990, the Allied Paper, Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River in southwestern Michigan was declared by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be a Superfund site â in other words, an abandoned industrial site containing significant amounts of toxic waste. The EPA and companies responsible for the waste in this area, which includes a three-mile section of Portage Creek as well as part of the Kalamazoo River, into which it flows, are currently involved in an effort to reduce the amount of toxic waste at the site, which is contaminated by PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) from paper mills and other factories.
History.
After the Industrial Revolution, many paper mills that sprouted up along the Kalamazoo River were found to be the cause of PCB contamination. The Kalamazoo Superfund site was added to the National Priorities List on August 30, 1990, and the First Cleanup Action began in late 1990. 
PCB Contamination
Polychlorinated biphenyls constitute a wide array of now-banned organic chemicals with a variety of industrial applications. At the Kalamazoo River site, most PCBs are a result of the recycling of carbonless copy paper during the 1970s, the waste products from which were dumped into the river. PCBs were produced from 1929 to 1979, when they were banned by the Toxic Substance Control Act. PCBs in the Kalamazoo River adhere to the fatty tissue of fish, and over time a process of bioaccumulation takes place, meaning that the PBCs appear in increasing concentrations in organisms higher up on the food chain, including humans. A report by the Michigan Department of Health found that the Kalamazoo River is now safe for recreational use despite some PCB contamination.
Kalamazoo River.
The Kalamazoo River makes up a large portion of the Kalamazoo River Watershed, which spans about 162 miles and feeds into Lake Michigan. The 80 miles of the Kalamazoo River and Portage Creek are officially divided into five sections known as Operable Units (OU): Allied Paper/ Bryant Mill Pond (1), Willow Boulevard and A-Site Landfill (2), King Highway Landfill (3), 12th Street Landfill (4), and the Portage Creek (5). Portage Creek is southwest of Kalamazoo, connecting to the Kalamazoo River near the Kingâs Highway Operable Unit. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) manages the Superfund site.
CERCLA/ Superfund.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which was passed in 1980, calls for the cleaning up, under EPA supervision, of abandoned hazardous waste sites that release pollutants into the environment. The EPA works at the Kalamazoo Superfund site in conjunction with state and regional interest groups.
PRP.
The Potentially Responsible Party is an individual, corporation, or group that can be held financially responsible, at least in part, for the cleanup of the Superfund site. H. Millennium Holdings, Plainwell Inc., and Georgia-Pacific Corporation, the past and present owners of paper facilities that contributed to the PCB contamination, are now involved in the remediation, particularly covering the financial costs, and have also formed the Kalamazoo River Study Group (KRSG), which aids in the remediation of the site, particularly the Time Critical Removal Action.
Remediation.
The cleanup of Kalamazoo River Superfund site started upstream and has moved downstream. First, extant PCB sources were removed, with particular concern being expressed about the continuing release of PCBs in the Bryant Mill Pond area, where a $7.5 million removal program was carried out from June 1998 to May 1999.<ref name="Allied Paper, Inc/Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River" /> Two of the Operable Units, King Highway Landfill and Allied Inc., had sheet pile and caps installed, a process which does not remove PCBs but serves as a protective layering containing them. Time Critical Removal Action was declared in spring 2007 at the Plainwell site, where the removal process included sediment removal and the reintroduction of native plants. Any waste containing over 50 ppm (parts per million) of PCB was disposed of in Bellvilleâs Environmental Quality Corporation Wayne Disposal Landfill. Most of the waste, however, had a lower PCB concentration and was disposed of at nearby landfills.<ref name="Allied Paper, Inc/Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River" />
Portage Creek.
Work on the last OU, Portage Creek, began in September 2011. From April to October 2012, the EPA removed about 12,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soil and sediment from Portage Creek, replaced it with clean sediment, and planted new trees and other vegetation. The EPA planned to return to the site in March 2013 to âtry to complete the last segment of Portage Creek, where the creek and the Kalamazoo River meet.â If necessary, the EPA planned additional work at Portage Creek in the summer of 2014.

<doc id="20140855" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20140855" title="Ridgeway (road)">
Ridgeway (road)

Ridgeways are a particular type of ancient road that exploits the hard surface of hilltop ridges for use as unpaved, zero-maintenance roads, though they often have the disadvantage of steeper gradients along their courses, and sometimes quite narrow widths. Before the advent of turnpikes or toll roads, ridgeway trails continued to provide the firmest and safest cart tracks. They are generally an opposite to level, valley-bottom, paved roads, which require engineering work to shore up and maintain. Unmaintained valley routes may require greater travelling distances than ridgeways.
Prehistoric roads in Europe often variously comprised stretches of ridgeway above the line of springs, sections of causeway through bog and marsh, and other trackways of neither sort which crossed flat country.
A revival of interest in ancient roads and recreational walking in the 19th century brought the concept back into common use. Some ancient routes, in particular The Ridgeway National Trail of southern England, have been reprised as long-distance footpaths.
Origin.
Along ridge lines of hills, soil is often exposed and dry because of wind and natural drainage, and vegetation tends to be thinner. Where a beaten track evolves into a busier "road," constant passage by beasts, sleds and wheeled vehicles suppresses regrowth of vegetation. With the help of rain (and soil creep), a shallow trail can be worn down into the topsoil and smoothed without any purposeful road-making work. The thin soil and rocky subsoil, combined with the natural drainage provided by the slopes on each side, also tended to keep such roads dry.
In western Europe, where prehistoric roads have been extensively documented with the help of itineraries, traces on old maps and extant marks on the landscape, ridgeways are a typical feature of long-distance ancient routes through rugged, high-rainfall parts of Germany and across the island of Great Britain. These ancient trackways generally ran along the hilltops, only descending when necessary to cross valleys.
As such, they are an opposite to modern-style roads, which tend to run along the valleys and only ascend when necessary to cross the hilltops.
Courses.
In rugged parts of central Germany, ridgeways tend to strictly follow the watershed line proper, since traversing steep slopes was difficult for wheeled vehicles and uncomfortable for foot travellers unless someone had cut a track into the hillside and shored it up against washouts and slips. However, deviations around high peaks were common, usually taking the south side of the peak, presumably because the warmer side was usually drier. On flatter British hills, the line of the tracks often runs a little below the actual crest of the ridge, possibly to afford some shelter from the wind or to avoid travellers presenting themselves to marauders as a target on the skyline.
The discomfort of following ridgeways arises from their exposure to harsh weather and the fact that they are rarely level. The ridge line rises and falls. Moreover, at some point the ridge ends, so that the route must descend to ford a stream before rising again to follow the next ridge. Loads on two-wheeled carts had to be constantly shifted to the back during descents and to the front during ascents so that the animals could draw efficiently.
In medieval and later times ridgeways in England were used as drovers roads.
Since ridgeways were informal routes, and the rounded tops of many British and German ridges might be hundreds of metres wide, the track might change seasonally, or spontaneously, if any land alongside the trail appeared drier and firmer. But where the tracks were seen as marking boundaries, the course could no longer change without causing a property dispute. English ridgeway routes became fixed in the course of enclosures beginning about 1750.
Notable prehistoric ridgeways include:
Evaluation.
Some modern authors have suggested several advantages a ridgeway might possess: 
Demise.
Some ridgeway routes were adopted and paved by the Romans, even though the prevailing Roman road-construction practice was to build straight roads from point to point, rising and falling with the landscape.
Some German ridgeways were deliberately closed to force traffic into towns. In one instance, the central purpose of the Rheingauer GebÃ¼ck, a 38-kilometre fence erected in the 12th century, may have been to close down a German ridgeway and force traffic onto the Rhine river. Many ridgeways have continued in use with macadam or paved surfaces in modern times. Others fell into disuse when more level paved routes, either along valley bottoms or cut transversely along hillsides, were built parallel to them.
Noting the existence of such parallel routes, antiquarians in Britain came to associate ridgeways culturally with ancient Britons. However the evidence for the great antiquity of ridgeway routes is ambiguous. In the modern era, new cart tracks have generally avoided inhospitable high ground: the 1840s and 1850s Wagon Trails from the Missouri River to Oregon and California â rutted trails in bare earth â generally followed low courses.
Rediscovery.
In Britain, the term "ridgeway" has been in continuous use since Anglo-Saxon times 
as a generic term to distinguish any high travel route from a lower one. The earliest extant written form is spelled "hrycweg", dating from 938. In German, a variety of terms of similar date match the concept of a ridgeway: "Rennweg" (since circa 860: "Rennewec"), "Rennstieg" (1162: "Rinnestich"), "Bergstrasse" (C9: "Birgistrotun") and "hohe Strasse" (circa 1000 "Howestraze").
A revival of interest in ancient roads in the 19th century brought the concept back into common use. Although the Great Ridgeway northwest of London was the best known of such routes, 19th-century British antiquarians rediscovered numerous other local ridgeways and speculated that names such as Ryknild Street (a valley route) contained the word ridge in modified form. Scholars such as Georg Landau (1807â1865) began mapping and walking ancient ridgeway roads across Germany in the 19th century.
Recording prehistoric ridgeways today can be difficult. Trails only lightly worn into soil along ridge lines are generally no longer visible, but their courses are sometimes marked by modern roads and footpaths that have perpetuated the ridgeway routes.
A ridgeway previously used by carts often remains physically evident in the form of a hollow way: a trench or fosse eroded deep into the soil by constant passage of wheels and hooves. These are most common at inclines. Sleds, axles scraping the soil between wheel ruts, locked wheels skidding downhill and heavy weights dragged over the ground to brake the carts' descents would all continue eroding the surface down to the bedrock, if any, which then forms a natural pavement.
When it rains, the mud and debris in an inclined hollow way tend to be washed down the channel, slowly flushing it out and leaving banks on either side where hedgerows may develop and collect more material. Hollow ways can of course occur in any firm-ground trackway, not just in ridgeway sections. On level sections of a ridgeway, banks are less common' perhaps because travellers avoided large puddles and constantly changed the courses, or because any banks eroded.
Recreational.
From the 19th century onwards, old ridgeways which had not been converted into highways were often revived by hiking clubs or tourism authorities, marked out as scenic trails for walking, horse-riding or mountain biking far from the disturbances of motor traffic. An 1890 Baedeker guide recommended walks on The Ridgeway, and efforts to give that ridgeway legislative recognition began in 1947.
Some completely new recreational ridgeways have been devised where there was no tradition of the route being used for trade in previous centuries. 
Examples include the "Kammweg" established in 1904 in eastern Germany and the 197-kilometre Wessex Ridgeway in England, devised in the 1980s by the Ramblers Association, following ridges between the Atlantic coast and Avebury, with a preference for firm paths, good scenery and free access.

Caroline Mathilde (ballet)

Caroline Mathilde is a two-act ballet to music by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. Its original choreographer was Flemming Flindt. 
It tells the story of the eighteenth-century English princess Caroline Mathilde (sister of George III) who was sent to Denmark aged 15 to be married to the 17-year-old schizophrenic Danish King, Christian VII. The ballet portrays her unhappy marriage, the King's growing madness and her fatal love-affair with Struensee, the King's influential physician, which ultimately leads to their arrest, his execution and her exile, at the age of 20, separated from her two young children.
As with Davies' earlier ballet, "Salome", it was a commission by the Royal Danish Ballet. It was first performed on 14 March 1991, at the Kongelige Theater, Copenhagen. The orchestra was conducted by Markus Lehtinen.
Davies prepared two Concert Suites, each based on an act of the ballet.

2008 NAPA Auto Parts 200

The 2008 NAPA Auto Parts 200 presented by Dodge was a NASCAR Nationwide Series race held on August 2, 2008 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec. The race was the 23rd of the 2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series season. The pole position was won by Scott Pruett of Earnhardt Ganassi Racing, while the race was won by JR Motorsports' Ron Fellows. The race was the first points race in NASCAR history to be run with grooved rain tires.
Background.
The race was the second running of the NAPA Auto Parts 200, with Kevin Harvick winning the inaugural event in 2007. The track, Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, was one of two international tracks on the 2008 Nationwide schedule, along with AutÃ³dromo Hermanos RodrÃ­guez in Mexico City.
Various road course ringers ran in the race, including Patrick Carpentier, Ron Fellows, Max Papis, Scott Pruett, Boris Said, and Scott Gaylord.
Qualifying.
Scott Pruett of Earnhardt Ganassi Racing won the pole position with a lap time of 102.569 seconds and a speed of . Max Papis started second with a lap speed of , followed by Marcos Ambrose, Patrick Carpentier, Jacques Villeneuve. The remaining top ten comprised Ron Fellows, Boris Said, Steve Wallace, Brad Coleman and Joey Logano. The lone driver to not qualify for the race was Kevin O'Connell.
Race.
The race started at 3:30 EST, with pole-sitter Scott Pruett leading until lap 7, in which the caution flag flew for rain, followed by the red flag on the following lap. As a result, most teams added windshield wipers to the cars, while grooved rain tires were installed. Rain tires had been previously used in practice and qualifying for the 1997 NASCAR Thunder 100 exhibition race at Suzuka Circuit, and also in 1999 by the Camping World Truck Series during a practice at Watkins Glen International. The race was paused for about an hour before restarting. As a result of the rain, speeds dropped from to . On lap 14, Marcos Ambrose took the lead, leading for a race high 27 laps until he was penalized for speeding in pit road. Jacques Villeneuve took the lead on lap 41, which he subsequently relinquished to Ron Fellows on the following lap. Fellows held the lead for seven laps until the race was called due to severe rain on lap 48. On the same lap, Villeneuve, who did not have a wiper installed, collided with another car's rear; Joey Logano also crashed on the lap, hitting a car without brake lights. Patrick Carpentier finished second, followed by Ambrose, Ron Hornaday, Jr., and Boris Said. The top ten was rounded out with Carl Edwards, Jason Leffler, Greg Biffle, Clint Bowyer and Steve Wallace.

Belchior Febos

Belchior Febos, also called Phoebus (died 1632) was one of the leading Portuguese jurists of his time.
In the early 17th century, Febos practiced law before Portugal's supreme civil and administrative courts, the "Casa da SuplicaÃ§Ã£o" and the "Desembargo da PaÃ§o". His principal work, the two-volume "Decisiones Senatus Regnus Lusitaniae" (1619), a compilation of commented decisions of the supreme courts, was among Portugal's most significant contributions to the European scholarly discourse about the "ius commune".

40 Entre Las 2

K-Narias first album, "40 Entre Las 2" , sold 50,000 copies in the Canary Islands (the most sold in the Islands in the last ten years) in only three months.
40 Entre Las 2 is the first record work of the K-Narias, a project that is born to vindicate, in the letters of their songs, the defense of the woman, despised by some Latin interpreters. The urban rates of their music and the canary accent serve them to fight against the aggressions to the women. In this sense, Gara and Loida carry out the campaign "No a la violencia de gÃ©nero", against the bad treatments and directed mainly to the young people, through a song called "Todos Tenemos Que Luchar" composed and interpreted by this group and they also have a video for it realized by Eddy Cardellach.

Jalapa Mazatec

Jalapa Mazatec is a Mazatecan language, spoken by ca. 15,000 people, one-third of whom are monolingual, in 13 villages in the vicinity of the town of San Felipe Jalapa de DÃ­az in the Tuxtepec District of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Egland (1978) found 73% intelligibility with Huautla, the prestige variety of Mazatec. Literacy in Jalapa is taught alongside Spanish in local schools.
Grammar.
Jalapa Mazatec root words are primarily monosyllabic, and the intricate inflectional system is largely subsyllablic (Silverman 1994).
Phonology.
Jalapa Mazatec syllables are maximally CCGV. However, vowels distinguish several phonations, and like all Mazatec languages, Jalapa has tone.
Tone.
Jalapa roots distinguish three tones, low , mid , and high . In morphologically complex situations, combinations of these may form short (or perhaps mid-length) vowels with contour tones: have been recorded.
The simple tones are contrasted in "work", "puma", "mould".
In much of the literature, these are written with the numerals 1 (low), 2 (mid), and 3 (high).
Jalapa utilizes whistled speech, where each simple or contour tone is given a whistle pulse.
Vowels.
Jalapa Mazatec distinguishes five vowel qualities, discounting phonation: , , , , . Phonations are modal voice, breathy voice, and creaky voice; all phonations may also occur with the five nasal vowels:
Breathy vowels may have strong breathy voicing throughout their length. However, typically they are voiceless for the first 40% and then have modal voice, so that for example may be pronounced or . Similarly, creaky vowels tend to confine their creakiness to the first part of the vowel, often with glottal closure before modal voice: as or .
Jalapa is unique among the Mazatec languages in distinguishing breathy vowels. These arose through the contraction of Proto-Mazatecan disyllables of the form CVhV, where C was voiced and the two vowels were the same. When the two syllables carried different tones, these contracted into a contour. For example, proto-Mazatec "stone" became (through a presumed intermediate ); "thief" became ; and "your soap" became . Similar contractions occurred with CVÊV disyllables to produce creaky vowels, but creaky vowels already existed in the proto-language.
Jalapa also has a phonemic distinction of unclear nature that has been suggested to be "ballisticity". However, it lacks the characteristics of ballistic syllables in other Otomanguean languages. The only consistent distinction Silverman "et al." (1994) were able to measure was one of vowel length, with vowels of the alleged ballistic syllables being shorter than (two-thirds the length of) the vowels of the productive open class of nouns, with a slight increase in pitch. They may reflect the original short vowels of proto-Mazatec, as opposed to the vowels of morphologically complex monosyllabic nouns of modern Jalapa Mazatec. If so, Jalapa would have a three-way length distinction, as doubly long vowels are also found in morphologically complex situations. Note that this distinction is "not marked" in this article apart from this one table:
Consonants.
Jalapa consonants distinguish (prenasalized) voiced, tenuis, and aspirated plosives, as well as voiceless, voiced, and glottalized sonorants.
There is also a flap, , which only occurs in one morpheme, the clitic = "probably". In addition, the consonants , , are found in Spanish loan words.
The labial velars become bilabial before front vowels: "it is finished" vs. "John", etc.
Phonetically aspirated fricatives do not occur before creaky vowels, while aspirated stops do. Therefore Silverman et al. (1994) treats them as fricative-/h/ clusters.
Silverman (1994:126) remarks that voiced stops are prenasalized in intervocalic position, but later on the same page states that they are prenasalized in initial position. With voiced plosives, the nasalization is two-thirds the duration of the consonant. It is not clear if they ever appear without prenasalization.
Voiceless nasals are voiced for the last quarter of their duration.
Glottalized sonorants are variable in their production. The may occur as a glottal stop followed by a modally voiced sonorant, , , etc.; an initially creaky voiced sonorant switching to modal voice by the end; a fully creaky consonant; or the creak may extend into the following vowel.
Phonotactics.
Aspirated consonants do not occur before breathy vowels, and glottalized consonants only occur before modally voiced vowels. Nasal consonants only occur before nasal vowels. Voiced plosives are prenasalized in intervocalic position.
Consonant clusters include NC, where N is a nasal and C is a voiceless plosive or affricate, and SC, where S is a sibilant and C is a tenuis plosive or affricate.

S Monocerotis

S Monocerotis, also known as 15 Monocerotis, is a massive variable star system located in the constellation Monoceros. It is a spectroscopic binary system with an orbital period of 74 years. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It is a type O main sequence dwarf varying in between magnitude 4.2 and 4.6. The star lies at the base of the Christmas Tree Cluster in NGC 2264.
Physical data for the system is disputed. The Washington Double Star catalog reports it as having 8 components. From orbital parameters and association with NGC 2264 it is given a distance of 720pc, but the Hipparcos parallax suggests less than half that.

Hannah Mather Crocker

Hannah Crocker (June 27, 1752, in Boston â July 11, 1829, in Boston) was an American essayist and one of the first advocates of women's rights in America. She was born into the illustrious Mather family of Boston, and heir to its long history of Puritan activism. Her most important contribution was the 1818 book "Observations on the Real Rights of Women" in which she argued that education was crucial to the advancement of women. This included a courageous defense of Mary Wollstonecraft, who, in Boston society, was viewed as a libertine. Crocker's work was the first book by an American author on the rights of women. 
Life Overview.
Hannah Mather born on June 27, 1752 in Roxbury, Massachusetts. She was the daughter of Samuel Mather and Hannah Hutchinson. She married Joseph Crocker in 1779. With Crocker she had 10 children between 1780 and 1795. She died on July 11, 1829.
Ancestry.
Hannah Mather Crocker's great-great-grandfather was Richard Mather who started the Mather Dynasty. Richard Matherâs most famed son was Increase Mather. Increase had an important role in stirring up the controversial event that was the Salem Witch Trials. Increaseâs son Cotton Mather also participated in the Salem Witch Trials, but he was better known for what may be the founding idea behind the theory for vaccine. Cottonâs son Samuel also went into the church life and was the father of Hannah.
Life's Works.
Before her marriage, Hannah Mather Crocker set up a school for women to show that women had the same intellectual capabilities as men, if they have the same educational opportunities. After raising her children, she took up a career in writing. Some of her most famed works include: "A Series of Letters on Free Masonry", "The School of Reform; or, Seaman's Safe Pilot to the Cape of Good Hope"and "Observations on the Real Rights of Women, with Their Appropriate Duties, Agreeable to Scripture, Reason and Common Sense". In "Observations on the Real Rights of Women", Crocker argued that men and women were in all ways equal.
Possible Masonic Initiation.
Karen Kidd, a member of the Order of American Co-Masonry, has written about Hannah Mather Crocker possibly being initiated into one of the oldest masculine lodges in America, the famous St. Andrews Lodge of Boston.

<doc id="20141121" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20141121" title="Demand priority">
Demand priority

Demand priority is a media-access method used in 100BaseVG, a 100 megabit per second (Mbit/s) Ethernet implementation proposed by Hewlett-Packard (HP) and AT&T Microelectronics. Demand priority shifts network access control from the workstation to a hub. This access method works with a star topology.
In this method, a node that wishes to transmit indicates this wish to the hub and also requests high- or regular-priority service for its transmission. After it obtains permission, the node begins transmitting to the hub.
The hub is responsible for passing the transmission on to the destination node; that is, the hub is responsible for providing access to the network. A hub will pass high priority transmissions through immediately, and will pass regular-priority transmissions through exactly at the same time the opportunity arises.
By letting the hub manage access, the architecture is able to guarantee required bandwidths and requested service priority to particular applications or nodes. It also can guarantee that the network can be scaled down (downsized) without loss of bandwidth.
Demand priority helps increase bandwidth in the following ways: A node does not need to keep checking whether the network is idle after transmitting. In current Ethernet implementations, a wire pair is dedicated to this task. By making network checking unnecessary, demand priority frees a wire pair. This is fortunate,because the 100BaseVG specifications use quartet signalling, which needs four available wire pairs. Heavy traffic can effectively bring standard Ethernet networks to a standstill, because nodes spend most of their time trying to access the network.
With demand priority, the hub needs to pass a transmission on only to its destination, so that overall network traffic is decreased. This means there is more bandwidth available for heavy
network traffic.
Demand Priority was discovered by Albert J. Sofinski at Cornell University. He came up with the idea after feeding his dog and going on a walk. Upon returning, he quickly wrote down the idea, and it persists to this day.

Gibbus deformity

A Gibbus deformity is a form of structural kyphosis, where one or more adjacent vertebrae become wedged. Gibbus deformity can be a sequela of advanced skeletal tuberculosis and is the result of collapse of vertebral bodies. This can in turn lead to spinal cord compression causing paraplegia. 
When viewed from behind, the deformity is sharply angled, with the resulting humpback being more easily seen when bending forward.
A Gibbus deformity may result from the sail vertebrae associated with cretinism, the childhood form of hypothyroidism. It is also seen with tuberculosis and certain congenital syndromes, including achondroplasia.

Grandson of Essex County, New York, violin maker Henry Lewis Flagg, Russell de Gree Flag studied violin making with Charles Eastbrook. Flagg's violins and violas were mostly patterned after Stradivarius, although he did produce instruments patterned after Guarneri and Amati as well. Flagg used commercial oil varnish, typically orange-red or red-brown in hue. A resident of Rutland, VT, he began to use old wood recovered from local covered bridges beginning in 1933 . Having produced 150 violins and 15 violas by 1940, he ultimately produced over 200 violins and approximately 70 violas in addition to much repair work.

<doc id="20141263" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20141263" title="Melos Ensemble">
Melos Ensemble

The Melos Ensemble is a group of musicians who started in 1950 in London to play chamber music in mixed instrumentation of string instruments, wind instruments and others. The ensemble's reputation for excellence has encouraged composers to write music exploring these resources. Benjamin Britten composed the chamber music for his "War Requiem" for the Melos Ensemble and conducted the group in the first performance in Coventry.
They should not be confused with two other chamber groups of similar name, the Melos Quartet or the Melos Art Ensemble (an Italian group).
Founding period, 1950.
The Melos Ensemble was founded by musicians who wanted to play chamber music scored for a larger ensemble in a combination of strings, winds and other instruments with the quality of musical rapport only regular groups can achieve. The Melos Ensemble played in variable instrumentation, flexible enough to perform a wide repertory of pieces. All its members were excellent musicians who held positions in notable orchestras and appeared as soloists. The founding members, namely Gervase de Peyer (clarinet), Cecil Aronowitz (viola), Richard Adeney (flute), and Terence Weil (cello) planned a group of twelve players, a string quintet and a wind quintet with harp and piano, that might be expanded by other players, to perform the great octets by Schubert and Mendelssohn, the septet by Beethoven, Ravel's "Introduction and Allegro" and the "Serenade" by Arnold Schoenberg. Neill Sanders (horn, a member for 29 years until 1979), and Adrian Beers (double bass) were members from the beginning. All these musicians stayed with the group for decades.
Early members.
Other early members included Emanuel Hurwitz (leader 1956-1972), Ivor McMahon (second violin), William Waterhouse (bassoon), Osian Ellis (harp), James Blades (percussion), Lamar Crowson and Ernst Ueckermann (piano), Peter Graeme and Sarah Barrington (oboe), James Buck (horn), Edgar Williams (bassoon) and Keith Puddy (clarinet), expanded by Colin Chambers (flute and piccolo), Alan Hacker (bass clarinet), Eric Roseberry (piano), Leonard Friedman (violin), Kay Hurwitz (viola), William Bennett (flute), Stephen Pruslin (piano), Leonard Friedman (violin), Hilary Wilson (harp) and Timothy Brown (horn). In the opinion of William Waterhouse (writing in 1995), "it was the remarkable rapport between this pair of lower strings" (i.e. Terence Weil and Cecil Aronowitz) "which remained constant throughout a succession of distinguished leaders, that gave a special distinction to this outstanding ensemble."
Special projects.
A remarkable premiere for the group was Jacques-Louis Monod's 1962 presentation of Roberto Gerhard's "Concerto for Eight". This was followed by the 1962 premiere, and subsequent 1963 recording, of Benjamin Britten's "War Requiem", for which the instrumental sections accompanying the English texts had been written specifically for the Melos, and were directed by the composer in the performance. The recording received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. In 1964 and 1965 the Melos Ensemble played several concerts at the new "Wardour Castle Summer School", founded by Harrison Birtwistle, Peter Maxwell Davies and Alexander Goehr. On 16 August 1964 they played among others "Monody for Corpus Christi" by Birtwistle, "Five Little Pieces" (first performance) by Davies, and "Suite" Op.11 by Goehr. A chamber concert on 17 August featured the 
Horn Trio by Brahms, on 18 August the "Quatuor pour la fin du temps" by Messiaen. In 1965, the Melos Ensemble played on 16 August "Pierrot Lunaire" by Schoenberg. On August 18 parts of "In Chymick Art", a cantata on texts by Edward Benlowes that Robin Holloway wrote for the Summer School, were performed for the first time. On 20 August they premiered two works they had commissioned, "Tragoedia" by Birtwistle, conducted by Lawrence Foster, and two 'In Nomine" of "Seven In Nomine" by Davies, conducted by the composer.
Festivals, broadcasts, tours.
The Melos Ensemble performed regularly at British and International Festivals, among others Warsaw, Venice, Cheltenham, Edinburgh, Bordeaux and the Aldeburgh Festival, their first U.S. tour was in 1966. The group gave many BBC broadcasts, and made over 50 recordings, first with the publisher L'Oiseau-Lyre. Gervase de Peyer directed the extensive recording programme of the Ensemble for EMI.
EMI recordings 1963-1973.
EMI reissued in 2011 a selection from historical recordings, titled "Melos Ensemble â Music among Friends". The principal players were Richard Adeney (and William Bennett, flute), Gervase de Peyer (and Keith Puddy, clarinet), Peter Graeme (and Sarah Barrington, oboe), Neil Sanders (and James Buck, horn), William Waterhouse (and Edgar Williams, bassoon), Emanuel Hurwitz (and Kenneth Sillito, first violin), Ivor McMahon (and Iona Brown, second violin), Cecil Aronowitz (and Kenneth Essex, viola), Terence Weil (and Keith Harvey, cello), Adrian Beers (double bass), Osian Ellis (harp) and Lamar Crowson (piano). The ensemble was expanded for single works by Christopher Hyde-Smith (flute), Anthony Jennings and Stephen Trier (bass clarinet), Barry Tuckwell (horn), David Mason and Philip Jones (trumpet), Arthur Wilson and Alfred Flaszinski (trombone), Robert Masters (violin), Manoug Parikian and Eli Goren (violin), Patrick Ireland (viola), Derek Simpson (cello), Hilary Wilson (harp), Marcal Gazelle (piano), James Blades, Tristan Fry, Jack Lees and Stephen Whittaker (percussion), and singers Mary Thomas (soprano) and Rosemary Phillips (contralto).
The collection of 11 CDs contains the works for large ensemble - six to thirteen players - for which the Melos Ensemble was founded, some composed for the ensemble:
Melos Ensemble of London 1974.
Following the death of Ivor McMahon in 1972, and the departure of three other members, the group briefly disbanded in 1973, but was reformed in 1974 with eight of the original players. In the later period the following musicians were also among those playing for the ensemble: Hugh Maguire (violin), Thea King (clarinet, 1974â1993), Nicholas Ward (violin, from 1977), Sylvie Gazeau (principal violin for many years), Gwenneth Pryor (piano), Iona Brown (violin), Patrick Ireland (viola) and Keith Harvey (cello). In 1975 the Melos Ensemble presented its 25th anniversary concert in London. In 1982 the Melos Ensemble appeared in Graz in a retrospective of Egon Wellesz, playing his "Oktett fÃ¼r Klarinette, Fagott, Horn und Streichquintett" Op.67.
New chamber music.
Composers created music for unusual groupings with the Melos Ensemble specifically in mind, leading in turn to the formation of similar chamber groups. Hans Werner Henze composed "Kammermusik 1958" for tenor, guitar and eight solo instruments, for example. In that way, the Melos Ensemble has directly and indirectly influenced music for new combinations of chamber musicians in contemporary music.

Jens Holmboe (bailiff)

Jens Holmboe (5 November 1752 â 4 December 1804) was a Norwegian bailiff. He is notable for his role in the settling of MÃ¥lselvdalen.
Personal life.
He was born in Lesja as the son of Hans Jenssen Holmboe (1721â1756) and Birgitte Marie Reinholtsdatter Ziegler (1723â1778).
In 1783 he married Anna Margrethe Irgens, who hailed from TromsÃ¸e. The couple had twelve children. Their Even, Hans and Leonhard Christian became involved in politics. Their son Michael Wide Holmboe was the father of politician Jens Holmboe and businessman Hans Conrad Holmboe, grandfather of painter Thorolf Holmboe and great-grandfather of Ragnhild RÃ¸d.
Career.
Holmboe worked as a bailiff ("fogd") in Senja and TromsÃ¸e between 1781 and 1800. He made a lasting mark in the region, as he organized settling in the MÃ¥lselvdalen valley, in what would later become the municipalities of MÃ¥lselv and Bardu. Farmers from the valleys Gudbrandsdalen and Ãsterdalen moved north mainly between 1791 and 1800, and Jens Holmboe helped about forty families with supplies and funding. Topographically, MÃ¥lselvdalen was and is similar to Ãsterdalen.
He died in 1804 in Ervik in Trondenes. A bauta to commemorate him was raised there in 1964.

'It Was You' sees Spiteri team up with producer Bernard Butler â the man responsible for much of Duffy's Rockferry album. With its soulful vocals, tooting trumpets and punchy chorus, this could almost have been a contender for the recent Bond theme. Spiteri, meanwhile, adopts the same no-nonsense approach she took with the world's most famous heiress, singing, "Something inside just died - it was you". To Spiteri's ex, it's the lyrical equivalent of a Glaswegian kiss.

The original wooden curb burned in 1937 and has been replaced by a replica.
The first recorded birth and death in Garza County took place here in February 1884, when Kate McCommis was born, daughter of Jim and Della Browning McCommis. She died the same day. Her grave is located about 150 feet southeast of the present-day dining hall.
C.W. Post purchased the land from the Llano Cattle Company in 1907 to pursue his dream of building a city. He built the town of Post about northwest and sold most of the arable farmland to settlers.
In 1926, the Post estate gave encompassing the former ranch headquarters to the South Plains Council of the Boy Scouts of America for use as a camp.
Facilities.
Camp Post's facilities include 12 camping areas, a dining hall, a ropes course, a rifle range, an archery range, an equestrian center, swimming pool, campfire ring, trading post, the OA Lodge, and the Mallet training center, used for leathercraft.

Jean Lepage

Jean Lepage (1779â1822) was a well-known French gunsmith. He worked for Louis XVI, NapolÃ©on and then Louis XVIII. He was the inventor of fulminate percussion systems for firearms, which superseded the flint-lock mechanism and opened the way to modern firearms. This followed the discovery of fulminates by Edward Charles Howard in 1800.
Between 1807 to 1810, Lepage invented a new way to fire portative firearms, by using the mercury fulminate priming medium to be fired by the blow of a percussion hammer. The new method permitted the abandonment of flint-lock firing mechanisms and opened the way to modern firing methods. The new mechanism used a magazine filled with fulminate primer, which would deliver a small amount of priming powder near the gun breech every time the magazine was cocked. Since the fulminate powder was highly sensitive to humidity, methods of coating the fulminate in varnish were developed, as well as methods of encasing the fulminate culminating with the invention of the percussion cap by FranÃ§ois PrÃ©lat in 1818 and Deloubert in 1820.

In October 2008, SBOBET was asked to turn over any evidence they might have on the possible match fixing scandal in The Football Association (FA) championship between Norwich City and Derby County. SBOBET denied the FA's request, deeming it was "excessive" and would be a breach of customer privacy Derby County won the game 2â1. In the end, the FA found no evidence that match fixing had taken place.
On 24 September 2009, two Bulgarian news agencies Novinite.com and 24 Chasa Daily published articles that wrongly suggested that SBOBET was responsible for fixing the football match between Levski and CSKA Sofia. The two agencies subsequently published correction articles, stating that SBOBET was not involved in any match-fixing scams, and apologized to SBOBET for publishing the untrue information.
In October 2009, representatives of the Premier League criticised 188BET and SBOBET for offering live betting on academy football games, maintaining that children and youth activities should not be exposed by international gambling organisations. Both bookmakers subsequently suspended betting on academy games and expressed their intention to seek clarification from the Premier League and the Professional Footballers' Association about which football markets they should be allowed to offer.

It was decided in 1996 to return the licence back to the FCC. Since that time,the FCC has granted a construction permit for WGYV to move from 1380Â kHz in Greenvile, Alabama to Aurora, Indiana to take over the 1030 frequency with a critical hours pattern reaching into portions of the former WBOL coverage area. WGYV airs an arch-conservative talk format. Also, WNVR, a Polish-language station in Vernon Hills, Illinois serving the Chicago area was granted a construction permit by the FCC to increase its coverage area on the same frequency during critical hours by upgrading its signal from 5,000 watts to 10,000 watts.
WTGR's transmitter site is located in Union City just east of the Ohio-Indiana state line with its studios and offices located in a building which formerly housed a carpet business on Martin Street (State Route 571 East) in Greenville.

The Burns and the Bees

"The Burns and the Bees" is the eighth episode of the twentieth season of "The Simpsons". It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 7, 2008. In the episode, after winning the "Austin Celtics" in a game of poker, Mr. Burns builds a new stadium in Springfield in the place where Lisa has built a bee colony. Lisa's subplot refers to the current world-wide disappearance of bees.
The episode was written by Stephanie Gillis and directed by Mark Kirkland. It marks a second use of the Christmas-themed opening, first seen in "Kill Gil, Volumes I & II". Billionaires Mark Cuban and Jeff Bezos and sportscaster Marv Albert guest star as themselves. In its original airing, the episode garnered 6.19 million viewers. It received mixed reviews from television critics.
Plot.
Mr. Burns attends the annual Billionaires' Retreat, where he wins the fictional Austin Celtics pro basketball team in a poker game against the Rich Texan. After witnessing the antics of Mark Cuban at a Dallas Mavericks game, Burns tries to win over Springfield basketball fans with his own antics. Burns fails miserably, and decides to build a luxurious sports arena. Meanwhile, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney dare Bart to prank the second graders by hitting a beehive with his slingshot. Lisa discovers, however, the bees that should be in the hive are dead. Willy explains the bees are dying all over Springfield by loss of habitat, thus contracting a fatal disease. Lisa seeks help from Homer (who at first was unwilling to save the bees until Lisa informs him that the bees make honey and, if they died, there will be no more honey) and Professor Frink who has an uninfected queen bee sting Lisa releasing pheromones which attracts many uninfected bees, which form a bee beard. After trying to keep the bees in the Simpson home, Lisa and Marge find an abandoned greenhouse for the bees to live in. However, the site of the greenhouse is exactly where Mr. Burns plans to construct his new arena.
Lisa attempts to convince the town to save the bee population, but despite her logical protest that they always get into trouble when they ignore her advice, she fails when Burns informs everyone about the amazing features of his arena. Lisa becomes depressed that the bee population is slowly dying. Homer and Moe attempt to help save the bees by mating a queen bee from Lisa's hive with Moe's Africanized bees to create a hybrid bee species strong enough to survive anywhere. On the night of the grand opening of Burns' sports arena, Homer takes Lisa to the top of a hill and shows her the hive containing the hybrid bees. When Homer accidentally releases them, the bees attack Burns' arena which resembles a bee hive. In the end, the arena is declared a bee sanctuary, enabling the bees to survive. At the next billionaires' retreat, Mr. Burns reveals how much the bees cost him. After it is discovered that he is four million dollars short of a billion he is kicked out of the retreat and into the millionaires' camp. Much to his horror, these millionaires got rich thanks to their low-class businesses, such as a minor-league hockey team.
Production.
The episode was written by Stephanie Gillis and directed by Mark Kirkland. Billionaires Mark Cuban and Jeff Bezos and sportscaster Marv Albert guest star as themselves. The episode marks a second use of the Christmas-themed opening, first seen in "Kill Gil, Volumes I & II".
Cultural references.
Lisa's subplot refers to the world-wide disappearance of bees known as Colony Collapse Disorder. In a scene where Homer imagines a future without honey, a small green robot resembling WALL-E from the 2008 film "WALL-E", gives him a bottle of honey and then turns Homer into a cube. The Billionaires' Retreat is the parody of the Bohemian Club.
In the opening sequence, Mr. Burns appears to be Ebenezer Scrooge with Smithers as Jacob Marley from "A Christmas Carol". The statue of Mr. Burns outside his new basketball arena is based on the Nike, Inc. "Jumpman" logo featuring Michael Jordan. Just before Burns is thrown out of the Billionaires' retreat, he asks Mark Cuban if he can let him "off the hook, for old times' sake" and Cuban refuses, referring to the scene in the 1972 film "The Godfather" in which Salvatore Tessio is led away to be executed after being revealed as a traitor. The Billionaires play Quidditch, as it is depicted in the "Harry Potter" film series, and use the paintings "Mona Lisa" by Leonardo da Vinci, "Whistler's Mother" by James Abbott McNeill Whistler and "The Scream" by Edvard Munch as target practice.
The songs featured in the episode include "Hip Hop Hooray" by Naughty by Nature during Mr. Burns' attempt to be more like Mark Cuban, and "Sea of Love" as performed by The Honeydrippers, which Homer and Moe play to their bees. Scott Joplin's "Maple Leaf Rag" is also played in the episode.
Reception.
In its original airing, the episode garnered 6.19 million viewers, a significant drop from the previous episode, possibly due to the fact the episode did not air in its usual 8:00 timeslot. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 7/10 and said that with an episode like this "I just don't laugh as much as I would have liked". Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of B and said that episode was "okay", but "boring". Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: "Part of me knows that the only way to enjoy the modern incarnation of The Simpsons is to stop expecting its stories to make sense. episode is not straightforward at all. Itâs like sometime after the tenth season, The Simpsons writers started using Mad Libs to generate story ideas. In fact, Iâve got a sneaking suspicion the only reason this episode exists is because someone came up with the title 'The Burns and the Bees' and just had to make it work." Harry Shearer received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role as Mr. Burns, Smithers, Lenny and Dr. Hibbert in this episode, but lost to fellow "Simpsons" cast member Dan Castellaneta. Stephanie Gillis has been nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the Animation category in 2010 for writing the episode. "The Simpsons" was the only show to be nominated in the category, with the other nominated episodes being "Take My Life, Please", "Eeny Teeny Maya, Moe", "Gone Maggie Gone" and "Wedding for Disaster". The winner, "Wedding for Disaster," was announced on February 20, 2010.

European balance of power

The European balance of power is an international relations concept that applies historically and currently to the nations of Europe. It is often known by the term European State System.
History.
16th to 18th centuries.
In the 16th and 17th centuries, English foreign policy strove to prevent creation of a single Universal Monarchy in Europe, which many believed France or Spain might attempt to create. To maintain the balance of power, the English made alliances with other statesâincluding Portugal, the Ottoman Empire, and the Netherlandsâto counter the perceived threat. These Grand Alliances reached their height in the wars against Louis XIV and Louis XV of France. They often involved the English (later the British) paying large subsidies to European allies to finance large armies.
In the 18th century, this led to the stately quadrille, with a number of major European powersâsuch as Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, and Franceâchanging alliances multiple times to prevent the hegemony of one nation or alliance. A number of wars stemmed, at least in part, from the desire to maintain the balance of power, including the War of the Spanish Succession, War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, the War of the Bavarian Succession and the Napoleonic Wars. Following Britain's success in the Seven Years' War, many of the other powers began to see London as a greater threat than France. Several states entered the American War of Independence in the hope of overturning Britain's growing strength by securing the independence of Thirteen of the colonies of British America.
19th century.
During the 19th century, to achieve lasting peace, the Concert of Europe tried to maintain the balance of power. This policy was largely successful in averting a full-scale Europe-wide war for almost a century, until the First World War. Specifically, during the first half of the 19th century, Britain and France dominated Europe, but by the 1850s they had become deeply concerned by the growing power of Russia and Prussia. The Crimean War of 1854â55 and the Italian War of 1859 shattered the relations among the Great Powers in Europe; however, the creation and rise of the German Empire as a dominant nation restructured the European balance of power. For the next twenty years, Otto von Bismarck managed to maintain the balance of power, by proposing treaties and creating many complex alliances between the European nations.
World Wars.
After the resignation of Otto Von Bismarck in the 1890s, the foreign policy of the German Empire became expansionary and the newly created alliances were proven to be fragile, something that triggered the First World War in 1914. One of the objectives of the Treaty of Versailles, the main post-WWI treaty, was to abolish the dominance of the 'Balance of Power' concept and replace it with the (global) League of Nations.
This idea floundered as Europe split into three principal factions in the 1920s and 1930s: Liberal Democratic states led by Britain and France, Communist states led by the Soviet Union, and authoritarian nationalists led by Germany and Italy. The failure of the Democratic states to prevent the advance of Nazi Germany ultimately led to the Second World War, which led to a temporary alliance between Britain and the Soviets.
Post-World War II: Cold War period.
During the post-Second World War era the West split into two blocs, a balance of power emerged in between the Eastern Bloc: affiliated with the Soviet Union and the Socialist nations of Central and Eastern Europe; the Western Bloc: affiliated with the Western democracies, particularly France, the United States, and Britain, and Third World neutral countries, including Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. The majority of the European democratic nations, together with Canada and the US, came together under the military alliance of NATO, which continues to this day and has expanded to other countries in Europe. The first NATO Secretary General, the British Lord Ismay, famously stated the organization's initial goal was "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."
Late 20th and 21st centuries.
In the present day the three most powerful members of the European Union (EU) â Britain, France, and Germany â are referred to as the EU three. Often in (internal) EU and NATO debates on strategy and general decision-making, two of the three are able to take a lead amongst the governments of those alliances. Germany and France (who are members of the Eurozone whilst the UK is not) are often regarded as the EU's economic leaders, such as with the on-going Euro crisis, whilst France and Britain (who have significantly more military capabilities and global presence than Germany) often lead in defence and foreign policy matters, such as the intervention in Libya in 2011. This, to an extent, represents a balancing of leadership power for the Western sphere of the continent. There continues however to be a wider, strategic balance of Western and (now) Russian power, albeit with the boundary between the two pushed further east since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with many former Socialist countries in central Europe having since joined the EU and NATO.

The Basketball Jones

The Basketball Jones now known as The Starters is a podcast, blog and television program that analyzes, and often satirizes, the National Basketball Association. The show is written and hosted by Tas Melas, Phil Elder (J.E. Skeets), Leigh Ellis, and Trey Kerby, and it is shot, edited, and produced by Jason Doyle and Matt Osten. Kerby is also the blog editor.
Background.
Melas, Skeets, Doyle and Osten met while attending Ryerson Universityâs Radio and Television Arts program in Toronto, Canada from 2001 - 2005.
Melas was the co-host of a talk show on SPIRITlive, Ryersonâs Internet radio station, called the âSports Doctors.â Doyle produced the weekly program. Skeets also co-hosted a show on the station, though it was not sports related.
Upon graduation, Melas worked as a story editor at The Sports Network and Doyle worked as a sound editor for Super Sonics, an audio post-production house. Skeets worked at a physician recruiting firm and Osten attended law school at McGill University.
Skeets began blogging in 2005 when a friend bet him that he could not write a new post every day for a year. The blog was called âJ.E. Skeetsâ and was a hodgepodge of observations, photos, and videos about random, quotidian topics. Later in the year, Skeets wrote a post about basketball which was linked on Deadspin.com. Noticing a significant spike in reader traffic, Skeets began writing exclusively about basketball, usually from an irreverent and humorous perspective. He began to make his name with a popular series titled, âRomance on the Hardwoodâ. These posts featured a photograph of two NBA players who appeared to be slow dancing accompanied by an imagined conversation between the athletes.
On March 25, 2011, during the weekly Basketball Jones "Overdose" Matt Osten announced he would be participating in the 2012 Iditarod. This will be the 40th running of the Iditarod and promoters are already very excited to have the confirmation from Osten. When announcing his participation, Osten proclaimed "I got's this".
The Podcast's Origins.
Skeets soon moved his writing to a new website the group called âThe Basketball Jonesâ. Drawing on his past experience with radio, Skeets decided to use the emerging medium of podcasting to produce a basketball-related talk show. He approached Melas and Doyle with the idea and together they worked out the tone and format of the show. When it debuted in January 2006, The Basketball Jones podcast was a half-hour program recorded weekly at Doyleâs house. The show immediately gained a small, but dedicated following. As its popularity increased, the three began recording shows more frequently.
Each show consisted of segments dedicated to the on and off court happenings in the NBA separated by short musical breaks. Regular features included âWanker of the Weekâ, in which the hosts highlighted an NBA player, coach, or executive guilty of committing a gaffe and âOne-on-Oneâ, in which the hosts took opposing views on a number of topics and argued over them in a âlightning-roundâ format. The show championed the âfan perspectiveâ of sports reporting pioneered by ESPNâs Bill Simmons. It also paid special attention to the NBA âblogosphereâ, a collection of bloggers who maintained web pages about their local teams. Many of these bloggers appeared on the show as experts on their particular team.
The Full Seasons.
At the start of the â06 - â07 season, The Basketball Jones produced a daily in a 15-minute version called âThe Fixâ and in a half-hour weekly round-up episode. âThe Fixâ was recorded remotely by Doyle and the hosts interacted with each other through Skype from their respective homes. The group met on the weekend at Doyleâs residence to record the longer show.
Though the showâs audience grew, the three partners became unsatisfied with the poor audio quality yielded by recording the show over the Internet. During the â07 - â08 season, The Basketball Jones was recorded daily in a studio at Super Sonics Productions in downtown Toronto and produced as a 20 minute show. The improved sound quality, word of mouth, and Skeetsâ growing popularity as a writer on Deadspin.com brought more listeners, bouncing the show into iTunesâ top 100 most popular podcasts. At this time, the website, thebasketballjones.net, registered approximately 60,000 page views per month. Towards the end of the season, Skeets was hired by Yahoo! Sports to edit their basketball blog which he renamed, âBall Donât Lieâ.
For the â08 - â09 season the show became a video podcast and was filmed in a downtown apartment building. The length of the show was shortened to 15 minutes. In addition to being available on thebasketballjones.net, the video podcast was also embedded daily on the Ball Donât Lie website.
Matt Osten, a Montreal native and graduate of McGill University's Faculty of Law, officially joined The Basketball Jones at the start of the '09 - '10 season. Osten, also nicknamed The Savage Bodyguard, only wears white suits while on bodyguard duty. Matt coined the phrase, "two towel performance", and regularly puts in a two towel performance during their off-season podcast, The Blank Jones.
Leigh Ellis joined the podcast during the No Season Required tour. On a recent episode: '7 Secrets of podcasting', J.E. Skeets explained why Leigh Ellis had joined the show. His odd, yet funny, Australian accent. Ellis appears on the podcast as a fact checker and rates The Fix on the 'Kate Scale' and shares his Tweets of the week.
The Jones recorded a live 500th episode on January 15, 2010.
On the 31st of October, 2012, the Jones combined their Video podcast on iTunes with their Audio podcast. This led to them reaching the No. 1 spot on iTunes for the amount of listeners.
On March 1, 2010 The Jones proudly announced that they had officially joined The Score, a Canadian multi-media sports network.
During the 2011-2012 NBA season, The Basketball Jones made a deal with the NBA to produce content that would be featured on NBAtv and NBA.com. Although numbers were not disclosed multiple sources say the contract was worth seven figures.
During episode 1007, the final episode of the 2012-2013 NBA season, The Basketball Jones announced that they would not be producing any " Blank Jones " podcasts during the offseason. The reason given to listeners was that TBJ was leaving the score.com. It was confirmed the show would be continuing under a new umbrella, which at that time was unknown.
The Starters.
On October 1, 2013, Tas Melas revealed that The Basketball Jones would not continue. The show is relaunching in the 2013-2014 NBA season on NBA TV, with episodes airing in late October. A video announcement was released on YouTube on October 2, 2013 where it was announced that TBJ was officially joining NBATV and would continue as The Starters. The entire team has moved their operations from Toronto to the NBA TV headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.
On October 21st, The Starters launched their first podcast, the first of a group of previews answering 101 questions about the 2013-2014 NBA season.
Show Format.
Each podcast begun with Skeets announcing the number of the episode, the date and random phrase (Ex: âMore is not always better.â, "I'm the one who's fighting. Not you, not you, and not you." or "There are over a 1000 different types of bananas") over a random song. The "bouncing balls" opening graphics then continues with the theme song âBones Attack!!â by The Meligrove Band. 
The show would continue with Skeets introducing each show with the greeting, âGood morning, sweet world!â. Skeets introduced Melas, Kerby (who responds with the phrase "ayoooo", and Leigh who said the phrase "Girls" and then Matt and Doyle (who he referred to as the man who makes the magic and drops happen). Doyle responded with âHello!â. The hosts then switched off reading the daily headlines. 
Then, the show was divided into one main talking segment followed by a shorter one that included viewerâs questions, âThe âWhoa Boyâ Fantasy Line of the Nightâ, and the 'Book-off picks' a feature in which the hosts competed at selecting winning teams based on gambling odds. The host with most amount of losses at the end of the month had to do the 'Book-off Pay-off' in which the winner of the month chose something embarrassing for the loser to do. That was shown by the; 'Book-off Pay-off: Repeat after me' on YouTube. Thursday's shows typically featured a segment changing from week to week. Melas ended the show with a quote to which Skeets replied, âEmbrace the day people.â This was followed by a sample of the song "Love Letter" by Easy Access Orchestra.
The Overdose, the hour long audio-only episode on Friday, featured interview, commentary and frequently diverted from basketball into the wacky stories from the NBA's week. The Overdose featured the Pun Gun game, where Skeets, Melas, Osten, Kerby and Ellis made puns on an NBA players name. Also Leigh Ellis shared his Tweets of the week suggested by listeners on Twitter. 
Skeetsâ frequent malapropisms such as âThe Internetsâ and mispronunciations such as Shane âBa-chÃ©â, Melasâ peculiar analogies and love of the phrase "There's no doubt about that", and Doyleâs eclectic musical selections, as well as various "drops" including the infamous Kenny Smith quote "Gimme Some Raptor News" were all hallmarks of the show.
During the podcast's first three seasons, Caroline Lesley, a New York-based actress introduced the show and recorded several interstitials that ran at the episode's breaks. She has not been incorporated into the video podcast.
Due to a switch in studios caused by Rogers Media purchasing The Score television channel, but not the website and mobile assets, The Basketball Jones discontinued distributing The Fix as a video podcast at the beginning the 2012-13 season. The Basketball Jones still live-streams video from The Fix on YouTube, but only releases the audio on their podcast feed. Additionally, The Overdose only appears on the Grantland Network every third Friday for the 2012-13 season.
Related Media Work.
Skeetsâ writing has appeared on ESPN.com and Deadspin.com. 
Melas has appeared as a pundit on Raptors NBA TV.
Doyle is the co-host and producer of âIdol Chatterâ, a podcast about reality television. He has also done sound editing work for many animated television programs including "Atomic Betty", "Carl Squared", and "Johnny Test".
The Basketball Jones has been featured on ESPN, "The New York Times", and "The Globe and Mail".
For the 2012 and 2013 NBA seasons, the podcast was featured on Bill Simmons Grantland Network podcast.

Baden I b

The Baden Class I b locomotives of the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways were built for the pontoon bridges from Heidelberg to Speyer. Altogether three of these engines were on duty, of which two had been taken over from the Palatinate Railway in 1874. A third machine was procured directly from the Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe in 1893.
All three locomotives were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DRG Class 88.75. Shortly thereafter they were retired, however, as locomotives of the Bavarian Class D VI took over pontoon bridge operations.
This class should not be confused with the earlier class with the same designation which is usually referred to as the Baden I b (old) to distinguish it.

Angela Rose

Angela Rose is an American activist, musician, and documentary film producer, best known for her work as the Founder and Executive Director of the national nonprofit PAVE: Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment.
Activism.
Rose made headlines when she was kidnapped from a shopping mall when she was seventeen years old. The man who abducted her was on parole for murder when he committed the crime. From this tragic story emerged one of the nationâs most passionate and impactful advocates for the prevention of sexual violence. Since her ordeal, Angela has lobbied for laws for victims and has promoted the importance of education on issues of sexual violence as well as the need to engage men in the movement. In regard to television interviews, Rose has appeared the Montel Williams Show, John Walsh Show, and newscasts across the country. Rose presents workshops and gives speeches at conferences, military trainings, and on college campuses.
"PAVE: Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment".
Rose founded PAVE: Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment in 2001. PAVE uses education and action to shatter the silence of sexual violence.
PAVE's work has been illustrated on "CNN" and "The Today Show". PAVE has created educational programming and tools as well as grassroots action campaigns. Rose produced a documentary called "Transition to Survivor" in which sexual assault survivors tell their powerful and emotional stories, from reporting the crimes to dealing with the aftermath of the violence. 
By watching the film and discussing it afterwards, students learn why many people choose not to report their attacks. They learn why sexual violence is too often a âsilent crime.â In the film, one woman talks about how blocking her memories, becoming anorexic and turning to self-mutilation to ease the emotional pain. Another breaks into tears on camera and confesses serious thoughts of suicide. Eventually all the survivors got help through counseling, friends, and family support. In terms of activism, PAVE's Survivor Justice Campaign has been instrumental in bringing awareness to egregious acts of misconduct towards victims of sexual assault throughout the criminal justice process.
Binding Project.
Through PAVE, Rose launched the Binding Project: Breaking Old Binds, Creating New Ties. The Binding Project is an international art empowerment campaign where participants write a word of empowerment on plastic zip ties, one to wear and one to send back to PAVE to be included in an installation art piece. This project was launched on the anniversary of the day Rose was abducted - the zip ties were what was used to bind her hands behind her back when she was kidnapped.

The school began on June 1, 1870, of the vestry of Christ Church and moved to the present old School building in or around 1876 . As the schools remained closed for the summer , November 1, All Saints Day, became a convenient date to commemorate the Founder and all those who laboured for the building of the Christ Church Schools. It is now celebrated as the Founder's Day.
As the school continued to grow in number, a need for more classrooms was felt. In January 1986 Bishop F.C.Jonathan took over as the Chairman of the school's Governing Body. It was under his leadership and during the principalship of Mrs. W. Nair, that a master plan for the school was conceived called "The Education Expansion Programme". This was inaugurated by the then Governor of Madhya Pradesh Prof. K .M .Chandy.
In July 1991, the first phase of the development programme was completed with 21 classrooms and a library and a computer laboratory. The second phase of 12 classrooms and three science laboratory and another computer laboratory was completed in 1995 for the Secondary and Senior secondary classes. The third phase was completed in 2004 with six large classrooms for the kindergarten. In July 2006, five more classrooms were made for the Middle School Classes, one Mathematics Laboratory for the girls of Classes I to X, a Primary School Computer lab and a staff room.[http://ccgirls.org/]

<doc id="20141693" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20141693" title="List of heads of state of Spain">
List of heads of state of Spain

This is a list of Spanish Heads of State; that is, kings and Presidents that ruled the country of Spain in the modern sense of the word. The forerunners of the Spanish throne were the following:
These lineages were eventually united by the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. Although their kingdoms continued to be separate, with their personal union they ruled them together as one dominion. Ferdinand also conquered the southern part of Navarre and annexed it to what was to become Spain. Isabella left her kingdom to her daughter Joanna of Castile. Ferdinand served as her regent during her insanity; though rebuffed by the Castilian nobility and replaced by Joanna's husband Philip the Handsome, he resumed his regency after Philip's death. In 1516, after Ferdinand II's death, his daughter Joanna inherited the kingdom of Aragon, but was kept prisoner at Tordesillas as insane. As Joanna's son, the future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, did not want to be merely a regent, he was proclaimed king of Castile and Aragon jointly with his mother in Brussels. Subsequently, Castilian and Aragonese "Cortes" alleged oath to him as co-king with his mother. Upon her death, he became sole King of Castile and Aragon, and the thrones were thereafter united permanently.
During the First Spanish Republic (1873â74), Spain had heads of state known as the President of the Executive Power. It is only during the Second Spanish Republic (1931â39), however, that the official title of President of Spain (or President of the Republic) existed. Today, Spain is a constitutional monarchy, and there is thus no person holding the title of President of Spain. However, the Prime Minister holds the official title of President of the Government.
Kingdom of Spain (1516â1873).
House of Habsburg (1516â1700).
Under Charles I, the two thrones of Castile and Aragon were finally united under one monarch.
Disputed claimant
In the year 1700 Charles II died. Charles' will named the 16-year old Philip, the grandson of Charles' sister Maria Theresa of Spain and King Louis XIV of France, as his successor to the whole Spanish Empire. Upon any possible refusal of the undivided Spanish possessions, the Crown of Spain would be offered next to Philip's younger brother Charles, duc de Berry, or, next, to Archduke Charles of Austria.
Archduke Charles of Austria had a legal right to the Spanish throne due to the fact that Charles's father, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, was the son of Charles' aunt Maria Anna of Austria, but Philip still had the better claim because Philip's grandfather, King Louis XIV of France, was the son of Charles' aunt Anne of Austria, the older of the sisters of Philip IV. However, Philip IV had stipulated in his will the succession should pass to the Austrian Habsburg line, and the Austrian branch also claimed that Maria Theresa of Spain, Philip's grandmother, had renounced the Spanish throne for herself and her descendants as part of her marriage contract. This was countered by the French claim that it was on the basis of a dowry that had never been paid.
Thus, the war broke out and Archduke Charles was proclaimed king of Spain, as "Charles III", opposite to Philip V. Charles renounced his claims to the Spanish throne in the Treaty of Rastatt of 1714, but was allowed the continued use of the styles of a Spanish monarch for his lifetime. Philip ascended the Spanish throne but forever renounced his claim to the throne of France for himself and his descendants.
House of Bonaparte (1808â1813).
The only monarch from this dynasty was Joseph I, imposed by his brother Napoleon I of France after Charles IV and Ferdinand VII had abdicated. The title used by Joseph was "King of the Spains and the Indias, by divine grace and the Constitution of the State ". He was also later given all of the titles of the previous kings. A government in opposition to the French was formed in CÃ¡diz on 25 September 1808, which continued to recognize the imprisoned Ferdinand VII as king. This government was diplomatically recognized as the legitimate Spanish government by Britain and other countries at war with France.
House of Bourbon (1813â1868) (first restoration).
Charles IV's eldest son was restored to the throne. Again the title used was "king of Castile, Leon, Aragon,â¦ by divine grace".
House of Savoy (1870â1873).
After the Spanish Revolution of 1868 deposed Isabella II, there was established a provisional government and a regency headed by Francisco Serrano y DomÃ­nguez, who acted as Head of State, from October 8, 1868 until December 4, 1870 while it was requested a new monarch. Amadeo I was elected as king and the new title used was "King of Spain, by divine grace and will of nation".
First Spanish Republic (1873â1874).
The First Spanish Republic started with the abdication as King of Spain on February 10, 1873 of Amadeo I, following the Hidalgo Affair, when he had been required by the radical government to sign a decree against the artillery officers. The next day, February 11, the republic was declared by a parliamentary majority made up of radicals, republicans and democrats. It lasted twenty-three months
Kingdom of Spain (1874â1931).
House of Bourbon (1874â1931) (second restoration).
Isabella II's eldest son was restored to the throne. "Constitutional king of Spain". Between the death of Alfonso XII and the birth of Alfonso XIII, there was an interregnum of seven months where Queen Maria Christina served as Head of State with the title of "Regent".
Second Spanish Republic (1931â1939).
The Second Spanish Republic was the system of government in Spain between April 14, 1931 when King Alfonso XIII left the country following a period of social unrest after the collapse of General Primo de Rivera's dictatorship a year earlier, and April 1, 1939 when the last of the Republican ("republicanos") forces surrendered to Nationalist ("nacionales") forces led by Francisco Franco, at the end of the Spanish Civil War.
Francoist Spain (1936â1975).
On October 1, 1936 General Francisco Franco was proclaimed Head of State ("Caudillo") in parts of Spain controlled by Nationalist ("nacionales") forces after Spanish Civil War broke out. After the end of war on April 1, 1939 General Franco took control of the whole of Spain. In 1947, Franco proclaimed the restoration of the monarchy, but did not allow the pretender, Juan de BorbÃ³n, Count of Barcelona, to take the throne. In 1969, Franco declared that Juan Carlos, the Count of Barcelona's son, would be his successor. After Franco's death in 1975, Juan Carlos succeeded him as the King of Spain.
Kingdom of Spain (1975âpresent).
House of Bourbon (1975âpresent) (third restoration).
Alfonso XIII's claim descended (due to his two eldest sons' renunciations) to his third son, Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, who was passed over in favour of his eldest son, whose title is "King of Spain". The Count of Barcelona renounced his claims in favour of his son in 1977, two years after Franco's death and Juan Carlos's accession.

Cha$e

Cha$e (pronounced Chase) is a reality television show aired on Syfy in the United States around the same time as Estate of Panic. It is based on the successful Japanese show "Run for Money Tosochuu" () which began airing on Fuji Television in June 2004. It was a mid-season replacement for the show "Battlestar Galactica".
Hunters.
The hunters (who resemble stereotypical Men in Black) in the game are meant to capture the contestants, thus removing them from the game. They are:
Former WWE Superstar Ricky Ortiz was a guest hunter on 11/25/08. Ricky managed to get at least one capture.
Not all of the Hunters get to hunt; one Hunter is selected in some episodes to be a "Spotter", whose job is to drive around the game board in a special vehicle and locate the contestants for the other Hunters, relaying the contestants' position to the others, though they themselves are forbidden from making any captures. The Hunters are forced to ignore the camera crews, and are only allowed to break chase when they see a Runner. The Hunters do not communicate to any of the contestants.
General Format.
10 contestants are released onto a playing field (called a "game board" in the context of the show). They are set a series of challenges, called "missions," for which they may earn "utilities" (see below). All the while, they must avoid being tagged by the show's resident hunters, more of whom are introduced onto the board as the game progresses; if tagged by the hunter, the contestant is "captured" and eliminated from the game, without winning any money.
Contestants earn money by finding "money flags" around the game board, each of which is worth bonus money. Each flag is worth $1,000, and there are 25 flags, thus a total of $25,000 available to be found. However, only the one who reaches the "exit point," or finish line, is able to keep the bonus money that he or she has found.
During the game, additional twists may be introduced by the host, such as making it easier for hunters to find contestants for a period of time for failing a mission, offering an opportunity to accept a guaranteed sum of money in exchange for leaving the game, or declaring a certain area of the game board off-limits.
The missions given to contestants at various parts of the game allow the participants to acquire defensive devices to negate the attacks of a hunter(s). Once the host initiates the mission, the contestants have a certain amount of time to locate the area the item is stationed/hidden, and solve the puzzle in order to unlock/obtain it. 
The game lasts a total of 60 minutes. Towards the end of that time, the host will reveal the location of an exit point. The first contestant to reach the exit point wins $25,000 in addition to any money flags collected; the others win nothing, unless they accepted a buy-out. If nobody finds the exit point within the 60 minutes, nobody wins. 
Utilities.
The utilities for the show help the contestants avoid being captured by hunters. Each contestant may use each utility one time only. They include:

SlaÄana MiloÅ¡eviÄ

Aleksandra SlaÄana MiloÅ¡eviÄ Hagadone (Serbian Cyrillic: ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐ°Ð½Ð´ÑÐ° Ð¡Ð»Ð°ÑÐ°Ð½Ð° ÐÐ¸Ð»Ð¾ÑÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ; born 1956, in Belgrade, SFR Yugoslavia), better known as SlaÄana MiloÅ¡eviÄ, , is a Serbian singer-songwriter, composer, record producer, and writer. She was one of the lead New Wave singers in 1980s in former Yugoslavia.
Career.
Early career.
SlaÄana MiloÅ¡eviÄ was born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Her talent for music became very apparent at the early age, so she started education in classical music at the age of five, playing piano. Few years later, her interest turned to studying violin. At the age of twelve she became a singer and a bass-guitarist in a rock and roll school band, though she had not given up violin playing. She recorded a first single at the age of fifteen, playing violin and singing Indian influenced music with a group âGaneshaâ.
1971â1977: Music groups.
From then on, her interests had shifted towards various artistic expressions such as acting, playing music and dancing in the fringe theatres and experimental movies. She acted in Belgradeâs Ex Art Theatre, Atelje 212 Theatre and in Academic Kino Club KrsmanoviÄ. As a violinist, a member of Radio Television Belgrade Orchestra, her career continued doing studio work. Nevertheless, playing in a big orchestra appeared to be an obstacle for a further creative development, so she decided to proceed as a soloist.
As a singer, she had won her first prize at âMaglaj Youth Festivalâ in 1974. In 1976, she toured the Soviet Union as a soloist in Sasha Subota Orchestra, where she had recorded a "Compilation of World Hits" LP and a single "Mikado" for Soviet label Melodiya. Besides extensive touring with hundreds of concerts performed throughout former Soviet Union, she took part in numerous TV shows. One of the highlights was her interpretation of Marina Tsvetaeva's poem âI Like When You Are Yearning for Meâ, sung in Russian on Moscow TV, in a special birthday greeting for Soviet Unionâs President Leonid Brezhnev.
1977â1987: Successful solo artist.
Being in constant discordance with restrictive regime and the media, despite all the efforts, she could not release a solo record in her homeland Yugoslavia for many years. Thus, she invests her funds and finally manages to produce and release the first single in 1977. Unexpectedly, it had achieved an immediate success hitting No.Â 1 on the charts. MiloÅ¡eviÄ's provocative first song âAu, Auâ caused controversial reactions. However, her creative potential, persistence and consistence of ideas had won over. She stimulated and influenced younger musicians and other less courageous, to follow her path.
From then on, every song she had released hit the top of the charts: âAu, Auâ (1977), âSimpatijaâ (1978), âSexy damaâ (1978), then âAmsterdamâ, and âOÄigledno nije mi svejednoâ, off of an "Gorim od Å¾elje da ubijem noÄ" LP (1979). MiloÅ¡eviÄâs fame spread throughout the entire region and the surrounding countries. At midnight, Hungarian audience celebrated with Alexandra an arrival of the New Year 1979, through her one hour performance on National TV, Budapest. -->
In 1982, as a Special guest, she embarked with her band on a national Yugoslav tour with English rockabilly legends Matchbox. In 1983, she started a band âNeutral Designâ in Munich, Germany and released a self-titled album. Musicians who took part in this project collaborated with stars and bands known worldwide such as: Santana, Nina Hagen Band, etc. Songs off of this LP were broadcast and sold in West Germany, Sweden, Yugoslavia and other European countries. A single âDas Licht von Kairo / Miki, Mikiâ released in Yugoslavia, became a mega hit.
At Opatija Festival 1984 MiloÅ¡eviÄ won a âSpecial Award for Interpretationâ for the composition âSamsaraâ. Another great success followed, with maxi-single âPrincezaâ, a duet with Dado TopiÄ, which premiered at the Jugovizija 1984. In the summer of that year, Alexandra filmed a 24 minutes animated show âThe Girl in a World of Chipsâ, for Bosnian TV, Sarajevo. The show was awarded a Plaquette at the international Montreux TV Festival. It also took âThe Best Yugoslav TV Show of the Yearâ award on national âStruga TV Competitionâ.
MiloÅ¡eviÄ had continued cooperation with her colleagues abroad and moved to London to work with the likes of Alan Darby, Russell Bell and Peter Godwin (David Bowie's songwriter). She also did music for commercials for BBC1 Advertising Department. As a composer and arranger she contributed in the making of Alan Darby's LP, released in Great Britain in 1985, on CBS Records.
She took part in the âU.S.E. Projectâ (United States of Europe, song performed by Alan Darby, author Midge Ure of Ultravox), recorded in Stevie Wonderâs studios in Paris where she took a role of a vocal producer assistant. In 1985, composition âPrincessâ was awarded a âGrand Prizeâ at Mesam Festival, Belgrade, winning âSong of the Yearâ title.
She supported organization of Yugoslav Live Aid (International movement for hunger relief in Africa, originated by Bob Geldof) and took part in a song dedicated to the cause, titled âZa milion godinaâ (1986). Next success, composition âFantastiÄno putovanjeâ, was performed on Mesam Festival 1986. Soon after, Italian National Television with producer Gian Luigi Morgia, filmed her 20 minutes show for RAI2 TV channel.
1988â1990: Yugoslav icon of 1980s.
In 1988, MiloÅ¡eviÄ did a successful remake of a song âDolazi zimaâ at the authorâs (DuÅ¡an MihajloviÄ) request.
Album "Aleksandra SlaÄana MiloÅ¡eviÄ & Darko KraljiÄ" with mellow jazz ballads, (an exception to her rock style), was recorded in 1987. That same year, a song off of the album âBez nadeâ won âGrand Prizeâ at Mesam Festival.
During her career, she performed title songs for several movies: "Crazy Years", "National Class" and for few documentary movies. Frequently she had been a guest vocalist and a guitarist on other musicianâs albums such as: Dado TopiÄ, Leb i Sol, Goran MiloÅ¡eviÄ (SlaÄana's brother, singer of Generacija 5), Nityananda, YU grupa and others.
She took part in numerous humanitarian projects. She was the originator and the executive producer of the Charity Festival âUnited Yu-Rock Forcesâ, organized for the benefit of paraplegics in Belgrade in 1988. Belgrade Paraplegic Organization nominated her an âHonorable Memberâ for the support she had given to the cause.
Thus far, doing concerts she had moved through hundreds of cities in the Soviet Union, from the polar region of Murmansk to the south of the island of Crimea. From Niagara Falls through Chicago, Cleveland, Mississippi, New York City to Los Angeles and many other cities in the USA, West Germany, Hungary, Greece, China, Canada and the entire former Yugoslavia.
In 1988, she joined the group of young classical composers from Belgrade Conservatorium recording and performing new classical artistic music. In 1989, composition âToccataâ by Igor Gostusky with MiloÅ¡eviÄâs vocal interpretation, had won two first prizes at the Experimental Classical Music Contest in Opatija and Munich. That same year, SlaÄana MiloÅ¡eviÄ was invited to take part in the Invitational Contest of International Friendly Cities Singers Meeting in Beijing, China. She had won a "Special Honorary Award" for an overall two-part competition that included interpretation of a traditional Chinese song and her original music. In a free form competition she had won a âSilver Cup Awardâ. Since she was so well received by Chinese audience, for whom this was one of the first encounters with western music, she was invited to perform in various concert-venues and television shows.
The success of the first tour in China resulted in yet another invitation in 1989, when she performed a number of concerts and TV shows including a concert at the famous Pierre Cardinâs Maxim's. Chinese âHundred Flowers Recordsâ signed and compiled MiloÅ¡eviÄâs hit songs for their market in 1989. Upon returning to Europe she co hosted a TV periodical titled âCultural Bridge Beijing-Belgradeâ, produced by TV Belgrade. Further on, she continued to contribute in maintaining and developing cultural relations between China and Yugoslavia.
In 1989, she joined Baby Sister, headlining band on Sunset strip rock club scene in Los Angeles, California. A contract with a legendary American manager Richard Papasian and his management company Artists at Work was soon signed. After completing short tours in Yugoslavia and Switzerland she worked on a new demo-material in London.
1990â1999.
In 1990, she continued working on her album with American recording and production team in Los Angeles that included major American celebrities, such as Guns N' Roses`s songwriter West Arkeen, Lary Wilkens, Jeff Buckley, Derek Davies, John Buxter with whom she did music for a Canadian CD-ROM production company. In the meanwhile she worked on improving her guitar skills, studying with Hollywoodâs MIT reputable instructors: Scott Henderson, Bruce Bouillet, Scott Van Zen, James Hagadone and others. During that time she appeared on American TV shows and live scene.
Besides furthering her musical career, she enrolled in a Business school and specialized in the investment field, becoming a stockbroker. In this position she worked in film industry (Renegade Film Productions), digital communications (Digital Communications Inc.), interactive multimedia industry and projects in developing new computer technologies. After connecting with Tania Delic's International Trust Peace Fund, which enabled continuation of her musical endeavors, she visited Yugoslavia in 1995.
She recorded five new songs among which âTimes are Changingâ a collaboration with American author Derek Davis. She scripted and directed an animated video clip for âTimes are Changingâ in 1995. The following 1996, she and her brother Goran MiloÅ¡eviÄ, recorded a duet âOne must forgiveâ (also released on Goranâs album). MiloÅ¡eviÄ continued appearing in numerous TV shows and live performances in Yugoslavia and Europe.
In 1997, she started working on a material for the new album. During that period she visited China twice, where in Beijing she had directed a video clip for a title song âHarmonyâ for the album soon to be released. A video was a symbolic tale of manâs discordance with nature, which poses a treat to his existence. In spring of 1998, CD "Harmony - Compilation of Ballads vol. 1" was promoted in the artificial garden of Eden, Aleksandra designed for that purpose.
When Serbia and Belgrade were bombed by NATO in spring of 1999, Aleksandra and her brother recorded and shot a video clip for âNo More Tearsâ, a song they wrote together. It was an emotional call against violence and the sadness it consequently causes. Finnish singer Janne Hurme recorded this song for the Finnish market, where it reached a considerable success.
The first video clip off of the album "Animal Tested" soon to be released, Alexandra scripted and directed in December 1999. It was a controversial âLegalize Freedomâ, which was, due to the rules of the repressive political regime, immediately banned on almost all TV stations in Yugoslavia.
2000â2003.
On January 13, 2000, Serbian (Julian) New Year celebration day, MiloÅ¡eviÄ delivered the award to the âMost Resisting Media Reporterâ, political prisoner at the time. The celebration - protest was organized by âOtporâ (Yugoslav Youth Resistance) at the main Belgradeâs town square. During the protests against the authoritarian political regime of, at the time Yugoslav President Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ, SlaÄana MiloÅ¡eviÄ took an active role.
Later that year, over 100 000 people were present on Belgrade's Republic Square during the Democratic Opposition gatherings organized by NGO G17+, when SlaÄana took stage to play a set with her band. She joined the efforts of the people of Serbia in their strife for freedom and request for the new government. She also took part in âVreme jeâ (The Time has Come) project conceptualized by ANEM (Association of Independent Media) and G17+. She sang and played the song in support of the awakening of the democratic awareness in Serbia and the first free elections. She had played concerts on public squares during the entire democratic campaign and spoke on the media in favor of it. After speaking at a Press Conference in Belgradeâs Media Center in July 2000 with MlaÄan DinkiÄ, one of G17+ leaders (former Treasurer in ÄinÄiÄâs Government, current Minister of Economy of Serbia), she was arrested in her residence. There was neither explanation nor there were any charges brought up. After questioning, she was let free. Voice of America soon reported about this harassment, which has continued for MiloÅ¡eviÄ for some time.
In the year 2000, SlaÄanaâs album "Animal Tested" got released in Great Britain for Wastelands Unlimited Record Label. She commented: âThis album of mine is created to challenge stupidity and backwardness, and is a voice against all-out manipulation.â The second clip off of the album, âMy Cross is Bleedingâ, was also self written and directed in summer 2000.
Due to her efforts in bringing new solutions to the disorganized music industry, Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Serbia appointed Aleksandra SlaÄana MiloÅ¡eviÄ a âCoordinator of the Reform of Music Industry in Yugoslaviaâ in March 2001. RTS Radio âProgram 202â produced 8 episodes of a one hour weekly radio show she wrote and hosted, titled âAnimal Testedâ. Her first literary achievement (with co-author Dr. Jasmina MaleÅ¡eviÄ) "Adam Don't Get Mad", was published and released by âDraslar Partnerâ, on 4 September 2001.
As a director and a screenwriter, Aleksandra promoted the book, putting up an outdoor theatrical performance in Belgradeâs Knez Mihailova Street. One of the criticâs highlights of the book "Adam Don't Get Mad" is the commentary made by one of the world most famous living authors Paulo Coelho: âWhen I first met Alexandra in â97, I was struck by the boldness and originality of her self-expression. Then I spoke to her and quickly noticed her acumen and sharp wit. Over the years we've kept in touch. I've learned that Alexandra is not only a versatile and eclectic person, but a highly resourceful individual as well. She has something that I've always admired in people: a heart to dream and courage to make her dreams come true. I hope that this book will just be the beginning of a long and rewarding writing careerâ.
In the year 2002, her record label PGP RTS, released the greatest hits compilation "Metamorfoza", a triple CD box set. The compilation was to celebrate her 25 Years Jubilee. SlaÄana also shot "Metamorphosis", one hour TV show, for the national TV RTS.

Buckden Pike

Buckden Pike is a mountain at the head of Wharfedale, a valley in the Yorkshire Dales, that stands above the village of Buckden. At , it narrowly misses out on being the highest peak in the area, the title instead going to nearby Great Whernside (704 metres). The summit is marked by a trig point.
Routes of ascent.
Unlike other nearby mountains, such as the ever popular Yorkshire Three Peaks - Whernside, Ingleborough and Pen-y-ghent - Buckden Pike is less frequented by walkers, possibly because of its location on the edge of the National Park. Nevertheless, it is still a popular objective for fellwalkers. Perhaps the easiest and shortest route up the mountain is a bridleway from Buckden, although this is steep and boggy in parts, and therefore somewhat unsuitable for cyclists and those on horseback.
Another route, on Access Land, follows Buckden Beck as far as the disused Buckden Lead Mine, then joins a Permitted Footpath to the summit.
A longer and more challenging walk is one that includes Buckden Pike and nearby Great Whernside, which would typically start/finish (and vice versa) at Kettlewell or Buckden, and could be made into a circular walk by returning to the starting village on the Dales Way alongside the River Wharfe.

To the south of the summit is a memorial cross, dedicated to the memory of five Polish airmen of the Royal Air Force who crashed their Wellington Bomber on 30 January 1942. The memorial was created by, with help from various locals, the sole survivor of the crash Jozef "Joe" Fusniak, and completed on 8 August 1973. Read more at: www.buckdenpike.co.uk
The view.
The views from the summit can be described as some of the finest in the area. The most extensive are to the East and West. To the East is the ridge running from Little Whernside to the summit of Wharfedale's highest peak, Great Whernside. To the West are views into the heart of the Yorkshire Dales, including mountains such as The Yorkshire Three Peaks, as well as closer peaks such as Firth Fell and Yockenthwaite Moor. To be found close to the summit is a large wooden pole, standing vertically; it has a number of large holes focused on different views and is labelled with information cards.
Buckden Pike Fell Race.
Every year, Buckden Pike is host to the Buckden Pike Fell Race, on the day of the village gala in June. The route covers 4 miles and nearly 500 metres (1500Â ft) of ascent. The race record is held by Colin Donnelly who, in 1988, completed the course in a time of 30:51; the women's record is held by Carol Greenwood who ran 36:32 in 1996.

General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador

The General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador (known as the General Assembly of Newfoundland until 6 December 2001) is the legislature of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Today, the legislature is made of two elements: the monarch of Canada, represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the unicameral assembly called the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. The legislature was first established in 1832.
Like the Canadian federal government, Newfoundland and Labrador uses a Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which members are sent to the House of Assembly after general elections and from there the party with the most seats chooses a Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador and Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador. The premier acts as Newfoundland and Labrador's head of government, while the Queen of Canada acts as its head of state.
The legislature was originally bicameral. From 1832 to 1934, it had an upper house called the Legislative Council of Newfoundland. That house was abolished in 1934.
Between 1934 and Newfoundland's entry into Canadian Confederation in 1949, Newfoundland was under Commission of Government, and the General Assembly was suspended.

Early life.
Little is known of his early life except that he seems to have lived at Blackrath (Calverston) until succeeding to the Baltinglass title and family estate at Harristown in 1549. This branch of the Eustace family held strongly to the Catholic faith through the Reformation. As a boy, Roland's father had completed New Abbey near Kilcullen which was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1539. In 1558, he took his seat in the first Irish Parliament of Queen Elizabeth, but strongly opposed her "Act of Uniformity" of that year and for this and other actions, he was ordered to be arrested in 1567 and conveyed to London, but the order was not carried out.

Jean-Jacques Gaspard Foelix (1791â1853) was a French jurist and the founder of the science of comparative law in France.
After studies in Koblenz, Foelix practiced law in Paris, a profession which he saw mainly as a means to engage in his study of European legislation. His reputation as a scholar of comparative law rested chiefly on his 1833 founding of the journal "Revue du droit franÃ§ais et Ã©tranger". He wrote about 150 articles for the journal, many of which were concerned with German law. 
In 1838, the University of Freiburg awarded him an honorary doctorate for his efforts to mediate between the legal cultures of France and Germany.

<doc id="20142060" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20142060" title="Lebanese shipping">
Lebanese shipping

The shipping industry is a major contributor to the Lebanese economy, having Lebanon's capital city, Beirut, as its major operations center from where distribution takes place to the Middle East region. The industry, which provides international transportation, logistic and household services, cover the ocean division, air freight division, land freight division, custom brokerage division, packing, insurance and warehousing.
History.
Lebanese shipping, which witnessed flourishing periods in its early history, had its main expansion in the mid 20th century. Before 1975 the port of Beirut was a major entrepÃ´t for the Middle East, especially for goods bound for Damascus and Amman. In 1974 approximately 3.4Â million tons of goods were unloaded at the Beirut docks, 668,000 tons were loaded, and 932,000 tons of transit goods were handled. When the Civil War began, however, the port became a major battleground. Battles also took place there in subsequent clashes between 1978 and 1987.Despite strenuous efforts to restore the port to full working order, by 1987 it had yet to regain anything like its former prominence. Between the start of the Civil War in 1975 until 1983, the port's best year was 1980, when some 2.7Â million tons of cargo were unloaded, 248,056 tons were loaded, and 209,080 tons were handled in transit. The Israeli siege of Beirut led to a drastic drop in port activity in 1982, when goods handled fell to less than two-thirds of the 1980 level.
Lebanon's other traditional ports at Tyre and Sidon also have had troubled histories. Tyre suffered during the Civil War, during the Israeli invasions of 1978 and 1982, and during other Israeli military actions. Sidon was similarly afflicted, escaping only the 1978 assault. Both ports have also witnessed some internal conflict. After Israel's 1984 pullout from much of Lebanon, however, Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy. Although Sidon suffered from further Shia-Palestinian conflict, it recovered modestly, and its export trade increased in early 1987.
Israel has persistently intervened in Lebanese maritime affairs. Its actions ranged from dispatching gunboats to positions off Beirut, a fairly common occurrence, to closing ports under Israeli control, such as Tyre and Sidon in 1984. From time to time, Israeli forces searched ships bound to or from Lebanese ports. In 1984, late 1986, and early 1987, Israel also stopped several ships ferrying passengers between Larnaca in Cyprus and Juniyah, the principal port of the Maronite heartland. Israel claimed that the ships were being used to infiltrate Palestinian guerrillas into Lebanon and warned that the Larnaca-Juniyah link would be closed altogether if the vessels continued to carry Palestinian fighters.
Growth.
Although the shipping industry witnessed some past downturns however current numbers show increasing records and expanding activities. Lebanonâs Port of Beirut TEU activity up to July, 2008 reached 287,898 TEUs, representing an increase of 16% from the same period last year. On the other hand, Port of Beirut TEU activity increased 30.9% year on year to 444,165 in 2007. With these records, expectations of future growth in the shipping industry are up to 30%, thus making it one of the leading Middle Eastern countries in this industry.

Some notable Lebanese shipping companies include:

<doc id="20142145" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20142145" title="Hurricane Martha">
Hurricane Martha

Hurricane Martha was the only known tropical cyclone to make landfall in Panama. The eighteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Martha developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on NovemberÂ 21. Initially, the storm developed with sustained winds of 50Â mph (85Â km/h), skipping tropical depression status. It remained stationary and quickly intensified into a hurricane. Martha attained maximum sustained winds of 90Â mph (150Â km/h) on NovemberÂ 22. Subsequently, Martha weakened and drifted southward. On NovemberÂ 24, Martha made landfall in Veraguas Province, Panama, as a strong tropical storm. The system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over land on NovemberÂ 25.
Because the storm weakened prior to landfall, strong winds were not expected or reported in the impacted countries. In Panama, more than of precipitation may have fallen in some areas. Agricultural land was flooded in Almirante, Bocas del Toro and streets became inundated in low-lying areas of Puerto Armuelles, ChiriquÃ­. The storm also brought significant rains to Costa Rica. Flooding and mudslides isolated most of the capital city of San JosÃ©. Numerous streets were inundated in Golfito. Damage in Costa Rica reached $30Â million (1969Â USD) and 5Â deaths were reported.
Meteorological history.
Winds aloft in the vicinity of San AndrÃ©s, Colombia and the Panama Canal Zone indicated that a low-level circulation developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on NovemberÂ 20. According to the Best Track, Tropical Storm Martha formed at 1200Â UTC on NovemberÂ 21, with an initial wind speed of 50Â mph (85Â km/h). Thus, Martha skipped tropical depression status. Centered about northeast of Bocas Town, Bocas del Toro, the storm remained stationary for 24Â hours after tropical cyclogenesis. Martha immediately began deepening, becoming a hurricane at 0000Â UTC on NovemberÂ 22. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories at 0300Â UTC and erroneously indicated that it was a tropical depression and noted that conditions did not favor significant intensification. Later on NovemberÂ 22, a reconnaissance flight indicated Martha deepened to a compact hurricane, and the tropical cyclone attained a maximum sustained wind speed of 90Â mph (150Â km/h). Reconnaissance aircraft measured a minimum barometric pressure of , though it was later corrected to 979Â mbar (28.92Â inHg) in the post-season analysis.
The eye feature was about wide and it was described as poorly organized, although convection was increasing. After reaching peak intensity, Martha began drifting due south and slowly weakened. At 1200Â UTC on NovemberÂ 23, the tropical cyclone diminished to a tropical storm, after winds decreased to 70Â mph (110Â km/h) and a reconnaissance flight recorded an increased barometric pressure of . The storm maintained that intensity, and shortly before 1800Â UTC on NovemberÂ 24, Martha made landfall in rural Veraguas Province, Panama, about east of the mouth of the Calovebora River. Operationally, winds were thought to be only 50Â mph (85Â km/h) when the storm moved inland. Martha was the only tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in Panama, although it is possible that other Panama tropical cyclones were not detected. The storm rapidly weakened inland, deteriorating to tropical depression status early on NovemberÂ 25, twelve hours before dissipating over southern NgÃ¶be-BuglÃ© Comarca.
Preparations and impact.
Residents were warned to anticipate tides 5Â feet (1.5Â m) above normal near the expected point of landfall. Later, the forecast was decreased to 3Â feet (0.9Â m) above normal and pertained to tides in the Mosquitoes Gulf and Chiriqui Lagoon. Since Martha was a relatively weak tropical cyclone, flash floods were emphasized as the greatest threat. The National Hurricane Center stated that rainfall could exceed 10Â inches (254Â mm). Additionally, Arnold Sugg of National Hurricane Center warned residents of gale force winds and heavy precipitation, advising people living between Bluefields, Nicaragua and Almirante, Bocas del Toro, Panama to take precautions. 
In Panama, the storm dropped at least of precipitation, especially in the western portions of the country. As a result, at least half of agricultural land in Almirante, Bocas del Toro, was flooded, causing extensive crop damage. In Puerto Armuelles, ChiriquÃ­, persistent rainfall led to street flooding and inundated other areas. Similar conditions were reported in Golfito, Costa Rica. The effects of Martha resulted in five deaths, all of which occurred in Costa Rica. The nation incurred flooding from heavy rainfall, which caused significant destruction. The capital city of San JosÃ© received flooding. In all, damages were estimated near $30Â million (1969Â USD).

Everly (group)

Everly was an American folk musical duo formed in Battle Ground, Washington in 2008 by friends Bethany Joy Lenz and Amber Sweeney. Their debut EP, "Mission Bell", was launched on iTunes. 
Everly has already seen success with several projects, beginning with their three song EP titled "Mission Bell". Since then, the duo has had continued success with a series of digitally released B Track albums that have been featured on the The CW hit television series, "One Tree Hill", on which Lenz is an actor and director. Everly is signed with Hilasterion Recordsâand is set to record a full length album some time this year.
Lenz has confirmed via her Twitter/WhoSay account that Everly have split and will no longer be making music. 
Debut.
Everly is the result of two friends, Bethany Joy Lenz and Amber Sweeney, deciding to collaborate and share their passion for music and storytelling. Lenz and Sweeney have been writing songs individually for as long as they can remember. In 2008 they created Everly, realizing that two songwriters are better than one. According to Lenz and Sweeney on the release of "Mission Bell", "Everly is birthed of a friendship and a sisterhood that's been many years in the making, and we are proud to present this short collection of music as a "teaser" for what is to come." 
On November 5, 2008, Everly released a three song, acoustic EP on iTunes entitled "Mission Bell". It is an electric mix of country, folk and pop rock sounds. All songs are written and performed by Lenz and Sweeney. The duo released the EP through music outlets, iTunes, Amazon and CD Baby. "Mission Bell" featuring "Home Is Me - You Are Mine", "Stars", and "Little Children". On November 15, 2008, the duo released three additional tracks added onto "Mission Bell" titled "Hotel CafÃ©", "Mrs. Scott" and "Scheming Star", and a bonus track titled "Karen's CafÃ©", which was a specifically altered version of "Hotel CafÃ©" for an episode of Lenz's television series "One Tree Hill".
"Mission Bell" reached the No.Â 1 spot on CD Baby, an online music store specializing in the sale of physical compact discs and digital music downloads from independent musicians directly to consumers. The duo also digitally released an acoustic Christmas album in 2009 titled, "Fireside".
USO Concert.
On September 19, 2008 at the Marine Corps Air Station New River in Jacksonville, North Carolina Bethany Joy Lenz and musical acts Angels & Airwaves, and occasional "One Tree Hill" guest star and fellow musician Kate Voegele teamed up with the USO for a live concert event for military personnel. The event also included Lenz's ex-husband Michael Galeotti's band Enation, and ex-music partner Amber Sweeney who accompanied Lenz on stage to perform a song entitled "The Sweetest Thing" and their song dedicated for their troops overseas; "Home is Me - You are Mine". Lenz also sang her hit single "Feel This" which featured on One Tree Hill.
Everly on "One Tree Hill".
Lenz has performed a string of original tracks on "One Tree Hill" due to her character's ambitions to reestablish her music career. Everly had continued to use "One Tree Hill" as an avenue to promote their latest music.
In the episode titled "Even Fairy Tale Characters Would Be Jealous" Lenz's character Haley James Scott's friend Peyton Sawyer produces a massive USO concert at the military base where her brother is stationed. After its airing, Everly's single "Feel This" instantly rose to No.Â 14 on the iTunes folk charts and allowed them to maintain the No.Â 1 top seller spot on CD Baby for several weeks. In the episode titled "We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me)", Karen's CafÃ© is transformed into a glamorous nightclub with Lucas as its proprietor and Haley as the cabaret singer which allowed Lenz the opportunity to premiere more songs featured in Everly's EP. 
In the seventh season of One Tree Hill, Lenz re-released "Quicksand," a song originally written and performed by Lenz for her album with Epic. This performance kicked Haley James Scott's music journey and was immediately followed by her first solo tour Flying Machine.

TaishÅ Baseball Girls

Story.
In 1925, after being told by a baseball player that women should become housewives instead of going to school, two 14-year-old Japanese high school girls named Koume and Akiko decide to start a baseball team in order to prove him wrong. During this time, when even running was considered too vulgar for women, baseball is known as "what the boys do" and they face many difficulties when having to find enough members, to get permission from their parents and also when learning about the sport itself.
The first book in the series opens in TaishÅ 14 (1925), introducing Koume, who is the 14-year-old daughter of a yÅshoku restaurant owner, and a student at a local girls' academy. One day, Koume's friend, Akiko, asks her to join in an all-girl baseball team and have a match against a boys team. While the first volume can be read as a stand-alone work, the second volume develops the storyline further.
The second book is set in the summer of TaishÅ 14. Koume, Akiko, Manoe and the rest of the nine members of the Baseball Girls continue to face off against numerous all-boy teams, and have trouble dealing with the fast balls thrown by the boys. To combat the anxiety they experience, playing against more experienced teams, they decide to abandon their traditional baseball uniforms in favor of a kimono-style uniform. The girls also partition off the batter's box so that other teams cannot see what they are doing.
Apart from baseball, the series also deals with certain cultural changes that are not seen quite so often in anime. For example, the popular "sailor" school uniforms, now a staple of real-world Japanese schools, as well as school-based anime and manga, are only just being introduced into Japanese society during the TaishÅ period in which this work is based.

Polish Assistance

Polish Assistance, also known as âBratnia Pomocâ, is a charitable foundation based in New York City. It was created to provide financial aid to Polish immigrants, especially the elderly.
History.
Polish Assistance (Bratnia Pomoc), founded in 1956, grants financial aid to Polish immigrants, especially the elderly.
In its early stages the group sought to raise funds for Polish immigrants who arrived in the U.S. after World War II (WWII) in order to escape communism. . Most of those who were helped were ex-military, former government officials, educators, writers and artists who found it difficult to adapt to their new circumstances in a foreign country.
The nascent organization immediately began to raise funds under the leadership of its founders, Mr. and Mrs. Jan Dembinski. Initially the activity of Polish Assistance consisted of small grants and loans to individuals in need. Eventually, three boarding houses were purchased between 1973 and 1975 in Ocean Grove, New Jersey to accommodate up to two dozen people.. The houses were liquidated between 1992â1998. After the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, another property was purchased near Warsaw, Poland to accommodate those elderly who wanted to return to Poland. Eventually, the property was donated to a Polish foundation for the blind.
Mission statement.
"To provide financial assistance to needy persons of Polish origin; to assist such needy persons in adapting themselves to new economic and social conditions, and to help them to become better integrated in community life; to lend assistance to them in case of illness and distress and voluntarily to help them in any other possible way in case of need; to provide an information center to aid in the fulfillment of the foregoing purposes." 
Present activity.
Presently, Polish Assistance is focused on assisting needy Polish immigrants in the New York metropolitan area and it is expanding its efforts in Florida as well. Direct assistance to those in need is given on a monthly basis, usually to supplement low social security payments or to cover extraordinary medical bills. 
Polish Assistance is housed in a limestone neo-Renaissance three-story mansion built in 1917 which is owned and occupied by the Kosciuszko Foundation.
Events.
One of the main fundraising events for the Polish Assistance is the annual Bal Polonaise that is held in New York City in the Grand Ballroom at the Plaza. The evening begins with the traditional Polonaise dance performed by distinguished guests. Such distinguished guests over the years have included H.S.H. Princess Grace of Monaco, Artur Rubenstein, Helena Rubenstein, and Princess Lucie Shirazee.
Over the years locations included the ballrooms at The Pierre, St. Regis and Sheraton East. Thanks to the maestro pianist Arthur Rubinstein and his wife Nela, the first dance for the benefit of Polish Assistance took place in 1956 at the Park Avenue penthouse of Princess Gourielli, better known in the world of beauty as Helena Rubinstein.

Lebu River

Lebu River an important river of the Arauco Province. It has his sources in the western slope of the Nahuelbuta Range to the east of the city and port of Lebu, capital of the province and named for the river. 
The Lebu is formed from the confluence of the Riachuelos of Curanilahue and Pilpilco that meet at the base of that mountain range. From the confluence it continues to the west, widening with the flow of the Riachuelos of QuilaÃ±anco and CurihuillÃ­n, and with several streams that join it from the wooded heights on both of its banks. It goes on to empty into the Pacific Ocean at 37Â° 36' Lat. and 73Â° 41 ' Lon. after a course of about 100 kilometers until it is below the ford of CupaÃ±o, at the salto de GualgalÃ©n, where this strong torrent of the river that is about 20 kilometers from its mouth meets the upper reach of the tidal estuary. 
At the river mouth the coast forms a port or anchorage between the Morro de Tucapel to the south, and the Punta de Millonhue to the north. Between them extends the bar of the mouth, that only opens the way by a narrow channel. Above the mouth the river estuary in front of the city is narrow and further up the river is wide and deep. In the upper part of this estuary, is the location of the old fort of Santa Margarita de Austria. 
The name of the river is an alteration of the Mapudungun "leufÃ¼" or "leuvu", âriverâ; and in colonial times a valley of a river, that contained habitations of Indians was called a "levo".

<doc id="20142268" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20142268" title="Germanic-Roman contacts">
Germanic-Roman contacts

The contact between Germanic tribes and Romans can be divided into four aspects; the military aspect, the trade aspect, the gift aspect and the plunder aspect. All these aspects give probable answers as to how and why Roman objects got into Germanic hands, and why a vast amount of Roman objects still can be found as far north as Norway. It is noteworthy to understand how Roman objects brought elements of Roman culture with them, and how they to some extent shaped Germanic culture and identity.
Brief historical introduction.
The first contacts happened by the late 2nd century BCE, when Roman authors recount that Gaul, Italy and Hispania were invaded by migrating Germanic tribes. This culminated in military conflict with the armies of the Roman Republic, in particular those of the Roman Consul Gaius Marius. Six decades later, Julius Caesar invoked the threat of such attacks as one justification for his annexation of Gaul to Rome.
As Rome expanded to the Rhine and Danube rivers, it incorporated many societies into the Empire. The tribal homelands to the north and east emerged collectively in the records as Germania. The peoples of this area were sometimes at war with Rome, but also engaged in complex and long-term trade relations, military alliances, and cultural exchanges with Rome as well.
The Cimbri and Teutoni incursions into Roman Italy were thrust back in 101 BCE. These invasions were written up by Caesar and others as presaging of a Northern danger for the Roman Republic, a danger that should be controlled. In the Augustean period there was â as a result of Roman activity as far as the Elbe River â a first definition of the "Germania magna": from Rhine and Danube in the West and South to the Vistula and the Baltic Sea in the East and North.
Caesar's wars helped establish the term Germania. The initial purpose of the Roman campaigns was to protect Transalpine Gaul by controlling the area between the Rhine and the Elbe. In 9 CE a revolt of their Germanic subjects headed by the supposed Roman ally, Arminius, (along with his decisive defeat of Publius Quinctilius Varus and the destruction of 3 Roman legions in the surprise attack on the Romans at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest) ended in the withdrawal of the Roman frontier to the Rhine. At the end of the 1st century two provinces west of the Rhine called Germania inferior and Germania superior were established. Important medieval cities like Aachen, Cologne, Trier, Mainz, Worms and Speyer were part of these Roman provinces.
North of Limes, there were only trade contacts between Romans and Scandinavia, mainly with Jutes of Denmark. Indeed, the Roman Empire maintained trade-routes and relations with Danish or proto-Danish peoples, as attested by finds of Roman coins. Depletion of cultivated land in the last century BC seems to have contributed to increasing migrations in northern Europe and increasing conflict between Teutonic tribes and Roman settlements in Gaul: Roman artifacts are especially common in finds from the 1st century in Jutland. It seems clear that some part of the Danish warrior-aristocracy served in the Roman army.
Military aspect.
Members of different Germanic tribes and communities served in the Roman legions, and fought with the Romans. It's probable that for instance Germanic Chieftains who fought with the Romans, tried to adapt to, and adopt, Roman culture, and that they tried to identify with the Roman nobility. In exchange for military service, the Germanics got Roman objects, although not Roman weapons, as there were Roman laws against exporting arms to the Germanic tribes. Germanic tribes who fought against the Romans got war spoils, and they often used captured Roman swords and armour. 
The Romans probably influenced Germanic military tactics and organisation as well. As can be told from the huge Illerup Ãdal excavation in Denmark, in which huge amounts of Roman and Roman inspired arms and equipment were found. A lot of these were probably produced in Scandinavia, and a lot had Scandinavia "factory seals", after a Roman model. This not only tells us that the Germans did indeed use Roman arms, but it also tells us that they had the required knowledge and social organisation to support large armies, and produce standardised arms and equipment.
Finds of Roman inspired Spangenhelm type helmets in Germanic chieftain graves, also tell us that the Germanics were in awe of Roman culture (generally speaking). We know that the Romans used these kind of helmets, amongst other sources from the Column of Trajan in Rome, on which Roman legionaries are depicted, wearing helmets. Stephen V. Granscay writes:
"We do know that the Spangenhelm shows barbarian contact with another civilization [â¦]. We also know that it was an important object of personal adornment as well as protective value [â¦]. The man who wore such a headpiece was no longer a skin-clad barbarianâ¦". 
Grancsay's text may be outdated, but it's still interesting, because Grancsay points directly at concrete examples of how Roman culture helped shape Germanic identity, by ways of objects. He also suggests that these Roman objects embody the factors that made the basis of the Germanic warrior aristocracy that developed alongside and following the Roman Empire, such as the notable HimlingÃ¸je Dynasty, in the ways which the Romans may have supported Germanic tribes due to military regards, and equipped these tribes. And there may have been Germanics of a high class who participated in fights with or against the Romans, and thus acquiring Roman objects and Roman ways of thinking in military terms (strategies, organisation, etc...). 
It has been suggested that the Romans supported and equipped Germanic tribes in the part of Germania which is today's Denmark. Archaeological sources tell of Roman equipment and arms that have been discovered as far north as Scandinavia. Danish archaeologists: Lars JÃ¸rgensen, Birger Storgaard and Ulla Lund Hansen have suggested Germano-Roman alliances, in which Romans supported a Germanic power in today's Denmark. According to JÃ¸rgensen, this was either to destabilize Scandinavia, or to create a Roman friendly power which could help ensure peace and stability in the border areas.
Ulla Lund Hansen and Birger Storgaard have also suggested that Roman interests in Scandinavia were strong, and that there was direct contact. Storgaard alluded to a text written in accordance with an expedition led by Tiberius in year 5 A.D., in which Tiberius describes what has been interpreted to be Jutland, in Denmark, although this interpretation is based on myth. 
JÃ¸rgensen points to the Gudme-Lundeborg complex in Denmark. Archaeologists have found Roman coins and scrapmetal at Lundeborg, a trading place in relation to this complex. Hansen, JÃ¸rgensen and Storgaard interprets from these archaeological finds that Lundeborg may have functioned as a Roman port.
Trade aspect.
The Roman Empire depended on trade in many different ways, such as the import of grain. This was especially the case in the early periods of the Roman Empire. Lynn F. Pitts wrote: ââ¦At all periods Rome needed to have some kind of relationship, friendly or otherwise, with her neighboursâ¦â. It's thus very likely that a lot of the Roman objects found in Scandinavia arrived via trade and trade networks. Grain was a significant commodity in the Roman society. 
This trade may have been carried out via already existing trade networks, from the Mediterranean, via Germanic Chieftains to Scandinavia. These trade networks may have been established prior to the Roman Empire and suggest a complex and advanced social structure and organisation among the Germanic tribes and societies. Scandinavian amber has been found at Mycene, in Greece. This brings the term "tribe" into question, many archaeologists have abandoned this term because it provides a faulty image of the Germanics. This term may envision an image of Germanics as primitive people.
Gift aspect.
Another aspect of Germanic-Romanic inter-relations is the exchange of gifts. artefacts may have been traded to the Germanics as diplomatic gifts. For instance by diplomacy. Gifts were given to enhance and strengthen alliances, bonds and the likes. Archaeologist Lynn F. Pitts writes about the Roman relationship to the Marcomanni and the Quadi that: 
Rome was perhaps concerned to cultivate these Germanic tribes in order to counterbalance [â¦] their neighbours. Diplomacy rather than military strength kept the peace along [â¦] the frontier. 
This is an important point. The Roman empire became increasingly vulnerable as they expanded, thus stretching their military capacity. Pitts go on to write that the Marcomans were a very strong military power, with a standing army of 7000 infantry and 4000 cavalry. It's obvious that the Romans wanted to maintain peaceful relations with certain Germanic tribes. Especially towards the end of the Roman Empire, when it became ever increasingly weak. Pitts points out that ââ¦it is apparent [sic?] that, apart from short periods of hostilities, relations between Rome and the Marcomanni and Quadi were friendlyâ¦â. 
It became more and more common, as the Roman Empire neared its end, that the Romans paid tribute to Germanic armies who threatened to invade Rome. This takes us to the plunder aspect.
Plunder aspect.
As the Western Roman Empire collapsed, Germanic tribes reclaimed land taken by the Roman Empire. Thus many Roman objects were obtained, proliferating throughout much of Germania, most likely via the already existing trade networks, all the way to Scandinavia. War spoils may have also added to proliferation of Roman artefacts. This may also explain the high number of Roman arms in Germanic hands, despite the Roman arms embargo. Two silver cups found in a grave in Hoby, in Denmark, are likely to be have been war spoils from the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 A.D.

Gay Weddings

Gay Weddings is a 2002 American reality television series that aired on Bravo. The series, created by openly gay producers Kirk Marcolina and Douglas Ross, followed two lesbian and two gay couples as they prepared for their wedding ceremonies. Each episode combined interview footage of the individual couples and their families and friends with footage of the various couples going through their wedding planning activities along with video diaries from the couples themselves.
Reception.
LGBT-interest magazine "The Advocate" described "Gay Weddings" as "deliciously gripping". "MetroWeekly" out of Washington, D.C. dissented, saying that the series "is not stellar example of reality TV" and that it "has a cheap, thrown together on-the-fly feel".
Bravo aired the complete eight-part series on January 26, 2003 as counterprogramming to Super Bowl XXXVII. The ratings success of the marathon led Bravo to develop additional LGBT-interest programming, including the very successful "Queer Eye" and the gay dating show "Boy Meets Boy".
With the success of the first season, the production company advertised for couples to appear in a second season of the program. However, no second season was produced. Bravo has no plans to revive the series.
Controversy.
During the series' September 2 premiere, Bravo inadvertently ran a commercial for "family restaurant" chain Applebee's during "Gay Weddings", despite Applebee's having asked not to have its advertising placed in the series. Right-wing advocacy group Focus on the Family criticized Applebee's as an advertiser. Bravo acknowledged that the ad was placed in error and no additional Applebee's ads ran during the series. The LGBT media advocacy organization Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation called Applebee's request not to have its ads run during "Gay Weddings" disappointing and suggested that Applebee's ran a risk of alienating a significant customer base.

Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia

The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia is an astronomy website, founded in Paris, France at the Meudon Observatory by Jean Schneider in February 1995, which maintains a database of all the currently known and candidate extrasolar planets, with individual "note" pages for each planet and a full list interactive catalog spreadsheet. The main catalogue comprises databases of all of the currently confirmed extrasolar planets as well as a database of unconfirmed planet detections. The databases are frequently updated with new data from peer-reviewed publications and conferences.
In their respective pages, the Planets are listed along with their basic properties such as the year of planetâs discovery, mass, radius, orbital period, semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, longitude of periastron, time of periastron, maximum time variation, and time of transit, including all error range values. 
The individual planet data pages also contain the data on the parent star such as Name, Distance (pc), Spectral Type, Effective Temperature, Apparent Magnitude V, Mass, Radius, Age, Right Asc. Coord., Decl. Coord. Even when they are known, not all of these figures are listed in the interactive spreadsheet catalog. And many missing planet figures that would simply require the application of Kepler's third law of motion are left blank. Most notably absent on all pages is the star's luminosity. 
As of June 2011, the catalog aims to include objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, an increase on the previous inclusion criteria of 20 Jupiter masses.

Women's football in Brazil

Women's football is not as popular in Brazil as men's football, although it has increased in popularity in the 2000s. 
Due to strong and continuing social stigma, Brazilian society only minimally supports women's football. There is a sexist belief that football is not a sport for women. The country lacks a national women's league, and runs only state competitions because there is limited financial interest and support. The national league Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino ran for a year and was cancelled. The Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino was first played in 2007. Brazilian clubs won all editions of the Copa Libertadores Femenina.
The best players, such as Marta and Cristiane, were accidentally discovered and directly invited to play on the Brazil national team. In recent years, the national team contested the World Cup finals and Olympics gold medals, increasing the popularity of TV broadcasts of those tournaments. However, this was not sufficient to stimulate the footballing culture among women who prefer to support men's football over women's. Brazil has developed a major rivalry with the United States women's national soccer team.

The Mississippi Canyon is an undersea canyon, part of the Mississippi Submarine Valley in the North-central Gulf of Mexico, south of Louisiana. According to the U.S. Geological Survey GLORIA Mapping Program, it is the dominant feature of the north-central Gulf of Mexico. According to GCAGS Transactions, it has an average width of , and a length of . The US Minerals Management Service (MMS) applies the name Mississippi Canyon to numbered federal oil and gas lease blocks over a large offshore area centered on, but mostly outside, the submarine canyon.
Oil and gas exploration and production.
According to "Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 2004: America's Expanding Frontier", a report issued by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Gulf of Mexico OCS Region, of the ten deepwater discoveries in water depths greater than 7,000Â ft (2,134 m), three were in the Mississippi Canyon area: Aconcagua project, area/block MC305, deep; and Camden Hills project, MC348, deep, both discovered in 1999; and Blind Faith project, MC696, deep, discovered in 2001. In a separate section of the same report, note is made of acreage in the Thunder Horse project, MC778, acquired in 1988. Other projects noted for Mississippi Canyon include Thunder Horse areas/blocks MC775-778 and MC819-822, listed as completed grid PEA (programmatic environmental assessment) by BP.
An MMS list of 80 development systems of productive deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects from 1979 to 2003 includes 29 projects in the Mississippi Canyon area:
Five of the top 20 deepwater Gulf of Mexico procuction blocks for 2000-01 were in the Mississippi Canyon, including the top 2: Project Mars, deep, of oil equivalent (BOE); project Ursa, deep, of BOE; project Mensa, , of BOE; Cognac, , of BOE; Crosby, , of BOE, all managed by Shell.
Deepwater Horizon explosion.
On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil platform, located in the MMS Mississippi Canyon block 252, which is about off the Louisiana coast, suffered a catastrophic explosion; it sank a day-and-a-half later. Although initial reports indicated that relatively little oil had leaked, by April 27 it was stated by BP that approximately of oil per day were issuing from the wellhead, below the surface on the ocean floor. The resulting oil slick quickly expanded to cover hundreds of square miles of ocean surface, posing a threat to marine life and adjacent coastal wetlands. On June 10, the Flow Rate Group from the Deepwater Horizon Incident Joint Information Center reported that they have determined that the estimated flow rate from the out of control well head has been to per day.

Han Huang

Han Huang (éæ») (723 â March 17, 787), courtesy name Taichong (å¤ªæ²), formally Duke Zhongsu of Jin (æå¿ èå¬), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong. He was praised by traditional historians for his frugality and personal integrity, but blamed for being overly harsh and cruel in his governance.
Background.
Han Huang was born in 723, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an and traced its ancestry to the royal house of the Warring States period state Han. It also claimed, as ancestors, a line of officials during Han Dynasty, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Northern Zhou, Sui Dynasty, and Tang. He had at least five older brothers â Han Hao (éæµ©), Han Qia (éæ´½), Han Hong (éæ´ª), Han Huan (éæ¾£), and Han Hong (éæ±¯, note different character than his other brother) â and at least three younger brothers â among whom were Han Hun (éæ¸¾) and Han Hui (éæ´). Han Huang himself was said to be firm and studious in his youth. Because of his heritage, he was made an officer in the imperial guards early.
In 755, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang, and by summer 756 the armies of his new state of Yan were approaching Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee. After Chang'an fell to Yan forces, Yan forces tried to force Han Hao to serve in the Yan administration. Han Hao, Han Hong (éæ´ª), Han Hong (éæ±¯), Han Huang, and Han Hun tried to flee Chang'an and join Emperor Xuanzong's crown prince Li Heng, who would be proclaimed emperor at Lingwu (as Emperor Suzong). However, Han Hao, Han Hong (éæ´ª) and his four sons, and Han Hun were captured by Yan forces and executed although Han Hong (éæ±¯) and Han Huang were able to get away. Emperor Suzong honored the Han family members who were killed with posthumous honors.
During Emperor Suzong's reign.
Early in the "Zhide" era (756â758) of Emperor Suzong, Deng Jingshan (é§æ¯å±±) the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Qingqi Circuit (éé½, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong) invited Han Huang to be his secretary and the military commander of the militia of Qingqi's capital Beihai Commandery. However, with the realm engulfed in warfare at the time, Han was not able to report to Qingqi, and he fled to Shannan Circuit (å±±å, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). The surveyor of Shannan, Li Chengzhao (ææ¿æ­), had Han serve as his secretary. Subsequently, when Deng was moved to Huainan Circuit (æ·®å, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), he again asked for Han to serve on his staff, but before Han could report to Huainan, he was recalled to Chang'an, then again under Tang control, to serve as "Dianzhong Shiyushi" (æ®¿ä¸­ä¾å¾¡å²), a low-level imperial censor. However, Han Hong (éæ±¯) had offended the chancellor Wang Yu by failing to praise Wang with grand words when drafting the edict promoting Wang, and therefore, after Wang became chancellor in 758, he retaliated by putting the Han brothers in positions with no power. After Wang was removed from his chancellor position in 759, the popular opinion was that they had been unfairly treated, and Han Huang thereafter successively served as "Sibu Yuanwailang" (ç¥ é¨å¡å¤é), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (ç¦®é¨, "LÇbu"); "Kaogong Yuanwailang" (èåå¡å¤é), and then "LÃ¬bu Yuanwailang" (åé¨å¡å¤é), both low-level officials at the ministry of civil service affairs (åé¨, LÃ¬bu, note different tone than the ministry of rites). It was said that Han Huang was capable at evaluating officials and strong in character, and during the five years he served as "Libu Yuanwailang", he paid great attention to detail and knew the records well.
During Emperor Daizong's reign.
During the "Dali" era (766â779) of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, Han Huang was promoted to be "Libu Langzhong" (åé¨éä¸­), who supervised the "Libu Yuanwailang", as well as imperial attendant (çµ¦äºä¸­, "Geishizhong"). At that time, there was an incident where Wei Dang (éç¶), the magistrate of Fuping County (å¯å¹³, near Chang'an) was assassinated. After the assassins were captured, it was discovered that they were members of the Northern Army (åè»), under the command of the powerful eunuch Yu Chao'en. Yu sought a pardon for them on account of their military abilities, but Han Huang submitted a secret petition opposing Yu's request, and the assassins were executed. Han was thereafter made "Shangshu You Cheng" (å°æ¸å³ä¸), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau of government (å°æ¸ç, "Shangshu Sheng"). In 770, he was put in charge of selecting officials for the ministry of defense (åµé¨, "Bingbu"). In 771, he was made the deputy minister of census (æ¶é¨ä¾é, "Hubu Shilang") and put in charge of the economic affairs for the western half of the empire, replacing Diwu Qi. At that time, the imperial treasury was drained due to wars and corruption. Once Han became in charge, he concentrated on details and stamped out corruption, and whenever he found corruption in his subordinates or in local official, he would sought to punish them harshly. Further, by that point, there had been reduced instances of Tufan and Huige incursions and several straight good harvests, and therefore the imperial treasury was able to be replenished. However, it was also said that Han was cruel, unrelenting in his pursuit of money, and stripping every bit of revenues he could find. As a result, he drew much resentment.
In fall 777, major rainstorms fell on the western parts of the empire. Many of the salt pools at Hezhong Municipality (æ²³ä¸­, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) were damaged, but Han, not willing to exempt the taxes from the households in charge of the salt pools, submitted a report claiming that the pools not only were not damaged, but there was an unusual kind of salt being formed that showed good fortune. Emperor Daizong doubted this, and sent the officials Jiang Zhen (è£é®) to examine the salt pools. Jiang, after return from Hezhong, confirmed Han's report, and further requested that a shrine be established to celebrate the divine blessing. Emperor Dezong agreed, but this was viewed by popular sentiment as a major scandal at the time. Around the same time, Li Gan (é»å¹¹) the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (äº¬å, i.e., the Chang'an region) submitted a report stating that the fields of Jingzhao were being heavily damaged. Han, again fearing tax exemptions, stated that there was no damage. One of Li's subordinates, Liu Zao (åè») the magistrate of Weinan County (æ¸­å, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), wanted to ingratiate Han, and therefore submitted a report claiming no damage. The imperial censor Zhao Ji (è¶è¨) also confirmed this report, but Emperor Daizong became suspicious and sent another censor, Zhu Ao (æ±æ), to reexamine, and Zhu pointed out that much damage was being incurred. Emperor Daizong exiled Liu and Zhao, but did not punish Han.
During Emperor Dezong's reign.
In 779, Emperor Daizong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. Emperor Dezong had heard about Han Huang's harshness, and therefore stripped him of his financially related responsibilities and made him the minister of worship (å¤ªå¸¸å¿, "Taichang Qing"), transferring his responsibilities to Liu Yan. He then sent Han out of Chang'an to serve as the prefect of Jin Prefecture (æå·, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). Later in the year, he made Han the prefect of Su Prefecture (èå·, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) and governor (è§å¯ä½¿, "Guanchashi") of Zhejiang Circuit (æµæ±æ±è¥¿é). In 781, he made Han the prefect of Run Prefecture (æ½¤å·, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and military governor ("Jiedushi") of Zhenhai Circuit (é®æµ·, i.e., same area as Zhejiang Circuit). It was said that Han was an effective governor, and that he comforted the people and balanced the taxes. However, it was also said that he was harsh, and that whenever local minor officials â often members of strong local clans â committed crimes, he would execute them without mercy, believing that by doing so he would be stamping out potential rebellions against his rule. For the same reason, eh also banned the slaughtering of cattle, under the rationale that beef and wine were often used at feasts that were preludes to rebellions. He also executed large numbers of people due to allegations of crimes without certainty of their guilt, leading to much terror in the region.
In 783, due to Zhu Ci's rebellion, Emperor Dezong fled from Chang'an to Fengtian (å¥å¤©, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). With the empire thrown into confusion, Han trained his soldiers in preparation of war, and he also sent soldiers to aid the campaign against another rebel, Li Xilie, who had declared himself the emperor of Chu. His soldiers were instrumental in aiding the general Liu Qia (åæ´½) in recapturing Bian Prefecture (æ±´å·, in modern Kaifeng, Henan) from Li Xilie. He also prohibited people from entering and exiting Zhenhai Circuit and built fortresses (including rebuilding Shitou) and fleets, under the rationale that if Emperor Dezong decided to evacuate the Chang'an region and flee to the Yangtze River region like what occurred with Jin Dynasty (265-420), Zhenhai could become the emperor's base for recovery, and also to defend against potential attacks by Li Xilie's one-time ally Chen Shaoyou (é³å°é), the military governor of neighboring Huainan Circuit (æ·®å, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). This, however, led to suspicions that he was intending to rule Zhenhai as an effective independent realm. Meanwhile, though, because he was shipping supplies to Emperor Dezong, Emperor Dezong awarded him the title of Duke of Nanyang. Emperor Dezong was suspicious of Han's intentions. However, by 784, after Zhu's rebellion was defeated, with the Chang'an region stricken by a serious famine, at the persuasion of his key advisor Li Mi, he alleviated Han's apprehension by sending Han's son Han Gao (éç) to Zhenhai to request that he send food supplies as soon as possible. In response, Han sent a large supply of rice, causing Emperor Dezong to be very happy with him. HIs trust in Han was further enhanced when Chen died later in the year, and Han was able to dissuade Chen's subordinate Wang Shao (çé¶) from starting a disturbance to take over Huainan. He gave Han the honorary chancellor designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (åä¸­æ¸éä¸å¹³ç« äº) and put him in charge of the Yangtze-Huai River supply system. Han was created the Duke of Zheng, and later his title was changed to Duke of Jin.
In 786, Han headed to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Dezong â and ultimately, he would remain there until his death, even though he retained the title of military governor of Zhenhai as well. As he went through Bian Prefecture, he also persuaded Liu Qia, whose name had been changed to Liu Xuanzuo (åçä½), to go to Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor as well, by means of making large payments to both Liu and his army. Once he arrived at Chang'an, he began to exercise actual chancellor authorities, and he attacked the official Yuan Xiu (åç), whom the chancellor Cui Zao had put in charge of financial affairs for improprieties. With Emperor Dezong particularly happy about the large shipments of supplies that Han was shipping from Zhenhai to Chang'an, he put Han again in charge of the financial affairs. In late 786, he tried to defuse the tension between the major general Li Sheng, with him he was friendly, and Zhang Yanshang, by holding feasts (along with Liu Xuanzuo) for them and asking them to be sworn brothers. He also supported Li Sheng's advocacy for military action against Tufan.
Meanwhile, it was said that Han was so trusted by Emperor Dezong that he had the greatest authority among chancellors. He was also described to be so harsh that he would even batter minor officials to death within the office of the chancellors. Fellow chancellor Liu Hun, whom he had recommended, sternly spoke to him about this, and thereafter, it was said that Han was embarrassed and curbed his ways slightly. He died in spring 787 and was buried with great honors.

Bernt Michael Holmboe

Bernt Michael Holmboe (23 March 1795 â 28 March 1850) was a Norwegian mathematician. He was home-tutored from an early age, and was not enrolled in school until 1810. Following a short period at the Royal Frederick University, which included a stint as assistant to Christopher Hansteen, Holmboe was hired as a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School in 1818, where he met the future renowned mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. Holmboe's lasting impact on mathematics worldwide has been said to be his tutoring of Abel, both in school and privately. The two became friends and remained so until Abel's early death. Holmboe moved to the Royal Frederick University in 1826, where he worked until his own death in 1850.
Holmboe's significant impact on mathematics in the fledgling Norway was his textbook in two volumes for secondary schools. It was widely used, but faced competition from Christopher Hansteen's alternative offering, sparking what may have been Norway's first debate about school textbooks.
Early life and career.
Bernt Michael Holmboe was born in Vang in 1795, the son of vicar Jens Holmboe (1746â1823) and his wife Cathrine Holst (1763â1823). He grew up in Eidsberg with his nine siblings, and was the elder brother of noted philologist Christopher Andreas Holmboe. Holmboe was homeschooled from an early age, but was sent to the Christiania Cathedral School in 1810 to complete his secondary education. There he undertook extracurricular studies in mathematics. He enrolled as a student at the Royal Frederick University in 1814, a turbulent year in Norwegian history. Norway had been a province of Denmark since 1397, but had come under Swedish control in the January 1814 Treaty of Kiel. Following Norway's declaration of independence in the Constitution of 17 May, Sweden responded by waging a military campaign against Norway during the summer of 1814. Holmboe was a spokesperson for the student group opposed to the presence of Swedish troops in the country. Any outspokenness from the student community was highly visible at the time, as the university had only seventeen students as of 1813, its year of establishment.
As well as his private studies, Holmboe attended lectures given by SÃ¸ren Rasmusen. In 1815 he was appointed to the position of scientific assistant under Christopher Hansteen, a lecturer at the university, and delivered some lectures himself. In early 1818, Holmboe became a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School, a position that had become vacant in 1817. The school principal, Jacob Rosted, had invited Holmboe's brother, Christopher Andreas, who had also studied mathematics, to take up the position, but he had decided instead to concentrate on philology; Christopher went on to research the Sanskrit language among others. In his teaching, Holmboe drew inspiration from Joseph-Louis Lagrange.
Niels Henrik Abel.
At the Christiania Cathedral School, Holmboe met Niels Henrik Abel, then a pupil there. Holmboe quickly discovered Abel's talent, and proclaimed him as a "splendid genius" in his report card. The school's primary focus was on classical education and Latin, and so Holmboe tutored Abel privately. His personal support for Abel has been called "[Holmboe's] most important contribution to mathematics".
Holmboe and Abel became close friends. Two of Holmboe's younger brothers studied with Abel, and the three were also on friendly terms. Abel was invited to the Holmboe family residence in Eidsberg on several occasions, including to celebrate Christmas.
Abel died from tuberculosis in 1829, at the age of twenty-six. Ten years after Abel's death Holmboe edited and published his complete works in two volumesâ"Oeuvres complÃ¨tes de N.H. Abel" ('Complete Works of N.H. Abel'). He was the first to do so.
Later life and career.
Holmboe published his first textbook in mathematics in 1825. The 274-page book was named "LÃ¦rebog i Mathematiken. FÃ¸rste Deel" ("Textbook in Mathematics. Part One"). In 1827 he followed with the second volume, "LÃ¦rebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel" ("Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two"), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, the purpose of the books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.
In 1826, Holmboe was appointed a lecturer at the Royal Frederick University. Some claimed that he owed his appointment to Abel's absence, as the latter was travelling around in Europe at that time. Holmboe also taught mathematics at a military college, from 1826 until his death, and was promoted to professor at the Royal Frederick University in 1834. His later publications include "Stereometrie" ("Stereometry") (1833), "Plan- og sfÃ¦risk Trigonometrie" ("Plan and Spherical Trigonometry") (1834), and "LÃ¦rebog i den hÃ¸iere Mathematik" ("Textbook of Advanced Mathematics") (1849). Holmboe was an influence on other mathematicians as well as Abel, including Ole Jacob Broch (born 1818).
At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who had become a professor there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote a review of the book for the newspaper "Morgenbladet", in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.
Holmboe also became involved in the field of insurance. From 1832 to 1848 he was a member of "Tilsynskomiteen for private forsÃ¸rgelses- og understÃ¸ttelsesselskaper", the country's first public committee for the supervision of insurance companies. On the other side of the table, from 1847 Holmboe was a member of the board of directors of the insurance company Gjensidige, founded by his former student Ole Jacob Broch.
Legacy.
A Bernt Michael Holmboe Memorial Prize for teachers of mathematics was established in 2005, and is awarded annually. The prize money, NOK 50,000, is taken from the Abel Found, which also cover the Abel Prize. The prize is administered by the board of the Norwegian Mathematical Society. The current board chairman is Tom LindstrÃ¸m, professor at the University of Oslo.
A street at Majorstuen in Oslo, "Holmboes gate", has been named after Bernt Michael Holmboe. Before 1879 it was named "Hansteens gate", after Christopher Hansteen.
Marriage and children.
Holmboe married twice. His first wife, Nikoline Antonie Finkenhagen, born 1804 in Toten, died in 1839 after five years of marriage. They had three daughters, two of whom (Fredrikke and Nikoline, Jr.) reached adulthood, and one stillborn son. He married his second wife, Ingeborg Thorp in 1842. She was born in 1812 in Voss. This marriage produced two sons, Christopher and Jens, and two daughters, Cathrine and Olava. Only Jens and Cathrine reached adulthood.
Bernt Michael Holmboe died in 1850, and his second wife outlived him by thirty-three years.

The Rockville Railroad Station is a historic building located at Rockville, Montgomery County, Maryland. It is a brick Victorian picturesque structure with some Eastlake detailing, particularly in the roofline and gable decoration. It was built in 1873, and is one of the few survivors of the many picturesque county stations built along the Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and other 19th-century American railroads. The architect was E. Francis Baldwin, who also designed the adjoining freight house, built in 1887. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, although it continued to serve as an Amtrak station until 1981, when the 400-ton station was moved about 50 meters to the south to make way for the Rockville Metro station.

1935â36 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1935-36 campaign was a season that saw Town emulate their successes in the mid-1920s, by finishing the season in 3rd place. They managed to get the same amount of points as 2nd placed Derby County, but finished 8 points behind champions Sunderland.
Review.
Town's form dramatically improved from the disappointing 16th place the previous season. The season didn't have many big highlights with the exception of the 3rd place finish, although their position might have been even higher if Charlie Luke hadn't been transferred to Sheffield Wednesday and Alf Lythgoe hadn't had his leg injury which kept him out for the last 3 months.

Ballistic syllable

"Ballistic" syllables are a phonemic distinction in the Otomanguean languages Chinantec and Amuzgo. They have been described as characterized either with increased sub-glottal pressure (Mugele 1982) or with laryngeal abduction (Silverman 1994). The acoustic effect is a fortis release of the consonant, a gradual surge in the intensity of the vowel, followed by a rapid decay in intensity into post-vocalic aspiration. They may thus be a form of phonation.
Non-ballistic syllables are by contrast called "controlled".

Humane League of Lancaster County

The Humane league of Lancaster County was founded in 1917 to "prevent animals from becoming homeless through providing services and education to help people understand how to provide responsible lifetime care to their animals". It is based in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in the United States.
Early history.
On May 3, 1917, Miss Maud Haldeman (1874â1931), along with seventeen other women, formed the Woman's Humane League of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The organization's stated purpose was as follows: 
This corporation is founded for the prevention of cruelty to, and care of, children, girls, aged persons, and animals within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and to enforce all laws enacted by the Pennsylvania legislature or by Congress for the protection of the children, girls, aged persons and animals As social service agencies began to address the problems of woman and children, the League turned its attention exclusively to animal welfare. Although for 20 years complaints were investigated and resolved, no shelter was available for homeless animals until 1937, when animals were temporarily housed in kennels, fairgrounds and other locations in the area.[http://www.humaneleague.com/AboutUs/history.html]. A "Men's Advisory Committee" was formed in 1946 to assist the ladies, and soon thereafter, in 1947, the word "Woman's" was omitted from the name and formally changed to The Humane League of Lancaster County. 
Since April 2006, Franklin and Marshall College, Archives & Special Collections Department, Shadek-Fackenthal Library, has been the official custodian of the records of the Woman's Humane League of Lancaster County.
Today.
2007 marked the 90th anniversary of the Humane League of Lancaster County, which is located today on Lincoln Highway East, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with 30 staff members and over 150 volunteers. Maud Haldeman died in 1931 and bequeathed her estate to the Humane League of Lancaster County (unofficially estimated at over $200,000, or more than $2.6 million in today's dollars). Her legacy has been honored through the formation of the Maud Haldeman Society, a group of individuals who have included the Humane League in their estate planning through bequests or beneficiary designations.
Feral cat policy.
Beginning September 1, 2008, the Humane League adopted a "trap-neuter-return" policy and will no longer accept feral cats for euthanasia. Instead, interested parties are asked to schedule an appointment to have the cat spayed or neutered for a minimal fee. Traps are available for rental from the League. A trapped cat may be brought to the scheduled appointment, picked up post surgery and returned to the wild.

Borrelia recurrentis

Borrelia recurrentis is a species of Borrelia.
It can be associated with relapsing fever. "B. recurrentis" is usually transmitted from person to person via the human body louse. It has been known since the 1800s that the only known vector of "Borrelia recurrentis" has been the body louse. 
A 2011 study found "B. recurrentis" DNA in 23% of head lice from patients with louse-borne relapsing fever in Ethiopia. Whether head lice can transmit these bacteria from one person to another remains to be determined. 
It is notable for its ability to alter the proteins expressed on its surface. This is what causes the "relapsing" characteristic of relapsing fever.

The first USS "Wandank" (AT-26), originally Fleet Tug No. 26, later ATO-26, was a United States Navy fleet tug in commission from 1920 to 1922 and again from 1922 to 1946.
USS "Wandank" (Fleet Tug No. 26) was laid down on 7 April 1919 at Buffalo, New York, by the Ferguson Steel and Iron Company. She was launched on 21 October 1919 and commissioned on 23 March 1920 with Boatswain O. Rhode in temporary command, pending turnover of command to Lieutenant S. J. Drellishak in April 1920. Later that year, her designation was changed from Fleet Tug No. 26 to AT-26 as the U.S. Navy instituted its alphanumeric hull classification system.
Assigned to the 5th Naval District, "Wandank" operated out of Norfolk, Virginia, until decommissioned on 31 March 1922. Recommissioned on 8 May 1922, "Wandank" resumed the provision of tug services out of Norfolk for the United States Atlantic Fleet in the Hampton Roads-Virginia Capes area. During the summer of 1939, she operated off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, first to assist in rescuing 33 crewmen from the sunken submarine USS "Squalus" (SS-192) in May 1939, and later to assist in raising the submarine herself, including towing of the raised submarine to shallower water in August 1939.
"Wandank" was transferred to Boston, Massachusetts, on 8 October 1940 for special duty in the 1st Naval District. She operated out of Boston on coastal towing duties throughout World War II. Her duties included towing yard oilers and other small craft and participating in the towing of transport USS "Wakefield" (AP-21), which had been severely damaged by fire in September 1942.
On 15 May 1944, "Wandank"s designation was changed again, to ATO-26.
Decommissioned on 20 September 1946 and struck from the Navy List on 13 November 1946, "Wandank" was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 17 July 1947 and simultaneously delivered to W. A. Bisso of New Orleans, Louisiana. She was then in commercial service for the New Orleans Coal and Bisso Towboat Company as "W. A. Bisso" until 1971.

<doc id="20142849" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20142849" title="Bridge at Nimreh">
Bridge at Nimreh

The Bridge at Nimreh is a Roman bridge in the vicinity of Shahba (ancient Philippopolis), Syria, dating to the 3rd or 4th century AD. Its transversal arch construction derives from old building traditions of the Hauran region and is arguably unique in Roman bridge building.
Road network of the Hauran.
The Bridge at Nimreh is located in the Hauran (ancient name: "Auranitis"), a mountainous volcanic region c. 80Â km southeast from Damascus in the transitional zone between agricultural land and the desert. Due to fertile soils and sufficient rainfalls, the area yielded in Roman times particularly high returns, which could be transported on the extensive Roman road network. The Hauran lay at the junction of several long distance trade routes: the inland trade route between Petra, Damascus and Aleppo went right through the main emporium Bostra, while the trans-Arabian caravan route and the road to Palmyra, the later "Strata Diocletiana", touched the north respectively south of the region. 
After the annexation by emperor Trajan in 106Â AD, the infrastructure of the newly established Provincia Arabia was greatly expanded by the construction of Roman forts and military roads to ward off nomadic incursions; in Bostra the "Legio III Cyrenaica" was stationed. The rugged terrain, with many wadis crisscrossing it, made necessary the construction of solid bridges, another two of which have survived to this day: the Gemarrin Bridge and the Kharaba Bridge.
Construction.
The bridge is situated 10Â km southeast from Shahba, close to the modern road at the foot of the mountain village Nimreh, which was known in the Onomastikon of Eusebius by the name Namara and regarded as an important place ("vicus grandis"). Here, the bridge crosses the Wadi al-Liwa almost right-angled, making a small bend of 120Â° at its western end; a slightly elevated causeway continues for about 100Â m before trailing off. The bridge is 25Â m long, with the eastern section covering the larger part (15Â m). Interestingly, its width of 4.52 m corresponds exactly to that of the Kharaba Bridge. The span of its single arch is 6.73Â m, with a rise of 3.10Â m, resulting in a slightly less pronounced profile (c. 160Â°) than the typical Roman semi-circular arch (180Â°); the overall height from the riverbed to the apex of the arch is reported as 3.60Â m.
The vault was made of three parallel, transversal arches standing at intervals of 1.20Â m; the arches were built of 60Â cm long, 30Â cm wide and just as high ashlar, while the spaces in between are covered with longish basalt blocks. This design principle â transversal arches with lintels â seems to be unique among Roman bridges. It also appears in the Hauran in roof constructions of late antique basilicas, and the early Christian church in Nimreh, indicating a construction date in the 3rd or 4th century AD. Possibly, the bridge was built in the 3rd century AD, when the region prospered, culminating in a large building programm which emperor Philippus Arabs (r. 244-249Â AD) initiated for his home town Shahba, then Philippopolis. The practice of using transversal arches for vaulting large chambers was continued in the Hauran until the early 20th century.
Presumably, the bridge was built directly onto the solid stone. Its almost unadorned masonry walls consist of rectangular, roughly smoothed basalt blocks of varying size without mortar ("opus quasi-quadratum"). Since Roman bridges rarely featured basalt, its use is undoubtedly due to the availability of the material in situ. The spandrel walls on both sides are broken up, revealing the interior filling of stone, sand and earth. The pavement, parts of which are well preserved, consists of large, smoothed basalt stones.

Gasunie Building

The Gasunie Building is one of the most famous buildings in Groningen. It was built as a headquarters for Gasunie and was officially opened on 22 April 1994 by Her Majesty Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.
The building has 18 floors and is 89 meters high, which makes it the second tallest building in Groningen after the Martinitoren. It is situated in the south of the city, on the edge of the Stadspark and right next to the main highways. It is also considered one of the most beautiful office buildings in the Netherlands.
History.
When the old Gasunie building facilities could not meet the needs of growing number of the employees, the necessity for a new office emerged. After evaluation of the economical and practical issues of the project, a decision to build a completely new building was made. Eventually, the project started in 1989 with selecting a suitable site and creating a list of requirements, which architects should have implemented in their proposals.
Architecture.
The design of the building was developed by Alberts&Van Huut architects bureau and is considered to be a great example of âorganic buildingâ. There are two distinct parts in the building: high-rise section with offices and low-rise section with meeting rooms and service facilities. One of the main features of the building is its unique stairwell with glass âwaterfallâ which is 60 metres high and 40 metres wide. The floors of the building are visually linked by this glass wall, which creates a sense of unity and space. All the way up the main stairs are surrounded by, so called, hanging gardens.

Family and education.
Soames was born in Brighton, the son of William Aldwin Soames. He was educated at Brighton College, the public school which his father had founded in 1845, and in 1871 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge where he obtained his BA in 1877 and MA in 1881. In 1876 he married Eveline, the daughter of T. Horsman Coles from Ore in East Sussex. They had two sons and two daughters.
Career.
Soames studied architecture under Sir Arthur Blomfield who was an Associate of the Royal Academy. He then set up his own architectural practice between 1882 and 1898.
Politics.
Soames was a Liberal in the Radical tradition. He was Chairman of the East Marylebone Liberal and Radical Association. He was adopted as the Radical candidate for Ipswich at the 1892 general election and fought the seat, without success, in 1895. However he got his opportunity to enter Parliament at a by-election in the constituency of South Norfolk held on 12 May 1898. The by-election was occasioned by the resignation on grounds of ill-health of the sitting Liberal Unionist (formerly Liberal) MP, Francis Taylor. Standing as a Radical, Soames gained 4,625 votes. His Unionist opponent, Sancroft Holmes received 3,295 giving a very healthy Liberal majority of 1,330. 
Soames decided not to contest his seat again at the 1918 general election, by that time aged 66 years.

Unfortunately, the game was tied after nine innings, and Jackson was relieved by fellow future Twin Jeff Holly. Orlando won the game, 1â0, in 12 innings.
After just 10 starts in the minors, Jackson was called up to the Twins in June. In 19 games, Jackson went 4â6 with a 4.48 ERA. He did record one shutout in 1978, on July 7 against the Oakland Athletics.

In the majors, he pitched in 24 games (including 8 starts), going 4â4 with a 4.28 ERA. was Jackson's first (and, as it turned out, only) full season in the majors. He set career bests in wins (9), ERA (3.87), and strikeouts (90).
Jackson spent most of on the sidelines with a shoulder injury, appearing in just 14 games in the majors and 2 at Triple-A. In , the bottom fell out of Jackson's performance, as he went 0â5 and his ERA jumped to a career-worst 6.25. Things were no better in the minors, as he went 1â3 with an even worse ERA of 7.00 in 4 starts. On July 26, the Twins released Jackson, and he never again pitched in organized baseball.

Edmund George Lind

Edmund George Lind (June 18, 1829 â 1909) was an English-born American architect, active in Baltimore, Atlanta, and the American south.
Biography.
Lind was born in Islington, now a part of London, England; his father, Alexander Lind, was an engraver who had fought on the British side as a Loyalist at the Battle of Bunker Hill outside Charlestown, Massachusetts near Boston in 1775. When he was young, the family moved to Birmingham, England, where drawing and painting became his favorite amusements. After an attempt at studying law, he studied architecture at the London School of Design, then worked for several years in various architects' offices in London.
In 1855 Lind emigrated to New York City where he found employment as chief draftsman and assisting Nathan G. Starkweather, designer of the brownstone Gothic-style, fourth structure for the First Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, which was finally completed with the tallest spire in the city in 1875, (first three structures from colonial times in downtown area at northwest corner of East Fayette and North Streets (now Guilford Avenue), sold the site after the Georgian/Federal-era twin-spired church from 1795, was razed to the Federal Government for a new U. S. Courthouse, built 1859-60); and then moved to more residential and up-scale, tomey, Victorian-era Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just north of central business district at West Madison Street and Park Avenue). Lind moved to Baltimore to supervise its construction, but in 1856, left Starkweather's office to partner with William T. Murdoch, with whom he was associated with until about 1860. He married his partner's cousin, Margaret Murdoch.
In the late 1850s, Lind & Murdoch were selected to design the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, on behalf of financier George Peabody, who although born and raised in Massachusetts, spent a great deal of business time in New York City and London, had special regard for the city of Baltimore. Its original wing facing the 1815-1829 Washington Monument on the west side bordering Washington Place, which is also North Charles Street was begun in 1858, completed in 1861, and dedicated in 1866 in Peabody's presence, containing Peabody Hall (now Friedberg Concert Hall), conservatory rooms, and a picture gallery. In 1875, its east wing was begun along intersecting Mount Vernon Place (which is also East Monument Street), and in 1878, was finished under Lind's supervision. Its most impressive feature is its large central reading room, rising to the full height of the building under a skylight, with six stories of alcoves with wrought-iron work giving room for 300,000 volumes, and a checker board floor of alternating black and white marble slabs. Other examples of Lind's Baltimore work include the Memorial Protestant Episcopal Church at Bolton Street and Lafayette Avenue in the Bolton Hill neighborhood of northwest Baltimore, a church at the southwest corner of Dolphin and Etting streets, and the monument to Capt. John Gleason, of the 5th Maryland Infantry, in Cathedral Cemetery. He is also thought to have designed the English Tudor, Gothic-style building at North Howard and West Centre Streets for the Baltimore City College, the first of two on the site in 1875. The City College (formerly Central High School of Baltimore), an all-male public high school, was founded on Courtland Street (now St. Paul Street/Place and Preston Gardens), near East Saratoga Street in 1839, is the third oldest public high school in America. It was formerly located since 1843 in the old "Assembly Rooms" (a social dancing hall and place for society ladies and gentlemen for dinners, soirees, receptions and events), originally constructed in 1797 by Robert Cary Long, Sr. and also contained space for the first paid-membership and subscription Library Company of Baltimore at the northeast corner of Holliday and East Fayette Streets, until it burned along with the famous neighboring Holliday Street Theatre in a massive fire in 1873. Lind's first building was the first structure to be erected specifically for the use of the high school in its history. It collapsed in 1892, when the Howard Street Tunnel was being dug and constructed beneath from Camden Street Station in the south to the new Mount Royal Station in the north for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad through the downtown business district. It was replaced by 1895 by a second structure for BCC, designed by the architect partnership Baldwin & Pennington, which is still there today (2013), although now renovated since 1980 for apartments and condos, known as "Chesapeake Commons". 
In 1882 Lind transferred his practice to Atlanta, Georgia, where for a decade he designed mansions, factories, libraries, courthouses, hotels, Masonic lodges, commercial buildings, textile mill housing, and churches in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. His finest building in these years was the Central Presbyterian Church in Atlanta (1884). He also designed the Gwinnett County Courthouse in Lawrenceville, Georgia; the Mary Willis Library in Washington, Georgia; and the Milton Candler House in Decatur, Georgia; as well as a combined market and city hall for Guayaquil, Ecuador. Following the severe economic depression of 1893, Lind retired to Baltimore where he continued to practice on a limited basis. He died in 1909.
He completed several works in North Carolina. was an American architect.
During his career, Lind was active in both national and professional roles. He served as assistant supervising architect for the United States during the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant. He became a member of the American Institute of Architects in 1857, and a Fellow in 1870. Lind was a founding member of the Baltimore Chapter of the AIA in 1870 and he also served as president in 1871, and also from 1876 to 1882. He also served as vice president of the national AIA organization on two occasions. His interests extended beyond architecture. In 1894 he wrote an essay on the relationship between music and color, and transposed ""Yankee Doodle"", ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", and a number of other popular songs from music into color. He also investigated the importance of the number seven in acoustics and architecture, based on the seven colors of the rainbow and the seven sounds of the diatonic scale.
A number of his works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, maintained by the United States Department of the Interior.

<doc id="20143115" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20143115" title="2009 ASB Classic">
2009 ASB Classic

The 2009 ASB Classic is a tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts. It is the 24th edition of the ASB Classic, and was part of the WTA International tournaments of the 2009 WTA Tour. It took place at the ASB Tennis Centre in Auckland, New Zealand, from 5 through 10 January 2009.
The singles draw is led by WTA No. 4, Luxembourg, Dubai winner, Olympics gold medalist Elena Dementieva, Tokyo, New Haven, Stockholm titlist Caroline Wozniacki and Strasbourg champion, Fes, PortoroÅ¾ runner-up Anabel Medina Garrigues. Also competing are Stanford champion Aleksandra Wozniak, Prague quarter-finalist Shahar Pe'er, Nicole VaidiÅ¡ovÃ¡, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Carla SuÃ¡rez Navarro.
Changes.
At the 2008 tournament, the courts were changed to a blue Plexicushion surface, replacing the green Rebound Ace. This was consistent with the surface change that was also implemented at the Australian Open. 
For the 2009 WTA Tour the ASB Classic was chosen as part of the new 55 tournament calendar. A new tournament director, Brenda Perry, was brought in, and there was also an increase in prize money from $145,000 to $225,000. The event underwent a change in sponsorship, with Zealandia, a New Zealand horticulture firm, becoming a supporting partner.
Entrants.
Seeds.
Nadia Petrova, who was set to be the number two seed, was forced to pull out when it was announced that she had contracted viral meningitis in mid-December.
Other notable entrants.
The return of Marina Erakovic (a New Zealander) to this event provoked a strong interest from media in the country. In the 2008 event, Erakovic had reached the semifinals, defeating the top seed Vera Zvonareva in the process. Erakovic went on to have the most successful season of her career, despite some poorer results and injuries in the latter half of the year. Commenting on the 2009 tournament, Erakovic said, "Even though the ASB Classic is important and I want to do well in my home town, my sight is set on the Australian Open and to be 100 percent for that." Erakovic had had to rely on a wildcard to gain entry to the previous year's event, but in 2009 was a direct entrant. Another entry which drew attention from the media was that of Mirjana LuÄiÄ, who had reached the Wimbledon semifinals ranked 134 in 1999, but had been largely absent from the Tour in the preceding years for personal reasons. LuÄiÄ received a wildcard for the main draw.
Qualifying.
The qualifying tournament was played from 3â4 January. Four players received wildcards:
The four players to qualify were Ayumi Morita and Aiko Nakamura (both Japan), German player Kristina Barrois, and Italian Alberta Brianti.
Review.
"Day by day summaries of the women's singles and doubles events. The singles draw is composed of 32 players, with 8 of these players seeded, while the doubles draw features 16 players, 4 of which are seeded."
Day One.
The singles and doubles events both started on 5 January. In the women's singles, the seeded players who featured on the first day all advanced to the second round. Third seed and WTA #22 Anabel Medina Garrigues beat Italian Mara Santangelo 7â5, 6â0. Fourth seed Aleksandra Wozniak overcame her opponent MagdalÃ©na RybÃ¡rikovÃ¡ from Slovakia in three sets, winning 6â3, 6â7(4), 7â5. Shahar Pe'er, the fifth seed from Israel, sealed her passage into the next round with a straight sets triumph against Petra CetkovskÃ¡ of the Czech Republic. The final seed to go through, Czech Nicole VaidiÅ¡ovÃ¡ took three sets before triumphing 7â6(3), 4â6, 7â5 against Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia. In other matches, another Czech Barbora ZÃ¡hlavovÃ¡-StrÃ½covÃ¡ beat France's Virginie Razzano 1â6, 6â2, 6â3 to line up a second round match with Pe'er; Romanian Edina Gallovits also found out her opponent would be Medina Garrigues after beating yet another Czech, KlÃ¡ra ZakopalovÃ¡ 3â6, 6â2, 7â5. American Jill Craybas and French Aravane RezaÃ¯ recorded victories against Kimiko Date-Krumm and Eleni Daniilidou respectively. 
Several matches were played in the doubles event on the first day. The most notable result saw top seeds Jill Craybas (playing her second match of the day following her singles victory) and New Zealander Marina Erakovic knocked out by the Spanish pairing of Nuria Llagostera Vives and Arantxa Parra Santonja 6â4, 6â2. They were the only seeds to fall, with fourth seeds Chan Yung-jan (from Chinese Taipei) and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia advancing comfortably with a 6â2, 6â2 win over Ä°pek ÅenoÄlu of Turkey and German Jasmin WÃ¶hr. Chan and Pavlyuchenkova's win set up a second round match with Russians Elena Dementieva and Elena Vesnina who beat Natalie Grandin from South Africa and Latvia's LÄ«ga Dekmeijere 6â1, 6â3.
Day Two.
Day 2 saw the completion of the first round of matches in both the singles and doubles competitions. The remaining seeds who were not in action on the first day all won their matches and qualified for round two. During the day session, top seed and ATP no. 4 Russian Elena Dementieva had a far from straight forward match against Chan Yung-jan from Chinese, eventually coming through 7â5, 6â3. The young player from Taipei was hard-hitting but did not have enough to beat Dementieva. Second seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark, ranked at a career high of #12, crushed her opponent, Italian qualifier Alberta Brianti 6â1, 6â0 in 56 minutes to achieve a meeting with Jill Craybas. No.8 seed Carla SuÃ¡rez Navarro from Spain beat Nathalie Dechy 6â4, 6â0. She found out her opponent for round two later in the day, with Anne Keothavong from Great Britain winning 6â4, 6â2 against Croatian wildcard Mirjana LuÄiÄ. In other day matches, Elena Vesnina routed qualifier Aiko Nakamura, 6â1, 6â0 and qualifier Ayumi Morita beat Marta Domachowska, 6â4 4â6 6â4. The unseeded Marina Erakovic of New Zealand sealed her place in the second round by beating Nuria Llagostera Vives from Spain 7â5, 6â4.
Seventh seed Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova ensured that all eight of the seeds had made it to the second round by winning her match in the night session against German Kristina Barrois 6â3, 6â1. 
In doubles, second seeds Shahar Pe'er and Caroline Wozniacki progressed to the quarter-finals by defeating Argentinian Betina Jozami and Indian Shikha Uberoi 6â2, 6â2 but no. 3 seeds Czech VladimÃ­ra UhlÃ­ÅovÃ¡ and Ekaterina Dzehalevich of Belarus were beaten 6â4, 6â4 by Italian Mara Santangelo and French player Nathalie Dechy, a three-times Grand Slam doubles titlist. In other matches, Sarah Borwell from Great Britain and her partner Martina MÃ¼ller qualified for the quarter-finals, overcoming the disappointment of a 6â0 first set to take the next two 7â5, 10-7 on champions tiebreak against Aiko Nakamura (Japan) and Marta Domachowska (Poland). Edina Gallovits and Eva HrdinovÃ¡ defeated Australian wildcards Shona Lee and Kairangi Vano 6â3, 6â4. Finally, in an all American tie, Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears lost to Julie Ditty and Carly Gullickson 6â1, 6â3 to complete the quarter-final lineup.
Day Three.
After the first round passing without losing any seeds, five were knocked out on day three, all in straight sets, leaving just three seeds qualifying for the quarter-finals. 3rd seed Anabel Medina Garrigues lost to Edina Gallovits 6â3, 6â3. No. 6 seed Nicole VaidiÅ¡ovÃ¡ was beaten 6â4, 6â3 by Elena Vesnina. Aleksandra Wozniak, the 4th seed, was knocked out by Ayumi Morita 7â5, 6â2, no. 7 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova failed to progress as she lost 6â2, 6â3 to Aravane RezaÃ¯ while Carla SuÃ¡rez Navarro succumbed to Briton Anne Keothavong who continued her good start to life in the top 60 with a 6â2, 6â4 win. As for the seeds that progressed, top seed Elena Dementieva beat New Zealand's Marina Erakovic 6â2, 6â3; No. 2 seed Caroline Wozniacki narrowly saw off veteran Jill Craybas 6â4, 7â5. 5th seed Shahar Pe'er had to try hard to concentrate on her tennis because an Auckland-based protest group staged protests at her decision not to pull out of the tournament with a war taking place in Gaza. Nevertheless she became the third seed to progress, beating Barbora ZÃ¡hlavovÃ¡-StrÃ½covÃ¡ in a topsy-turvy match 6â3, 4â6, 6â2.
Day Five.
Day five saw both semi-finals take place im the singles draw. The only seeded player left in the draw, top seeded Russian Elena Dementieva and the world no. 4 as of the start of the tournament was involved in the first match. She faced French player and last year's beaten finalist Aravane RezaÃ¯. Dementieva won the match 6â2, 6â2 in less than an hour.
Later in the day, unseeded Russian Elena Vesnina took on British number 1 and world no. 60 Anne Keothavong, playing in only her second WTA Tour semi-final and whose ranking should improve after her progress during the tournament. Keothavong matched Vesnina for much of the first set, falling behind 5â3 with a single break of serve. But she did not give up and she broke back and then held her service game to level the first set. The set eventually went to a tiebreak, which the British player took 7-3. The second set was a completely different story, Vesnina dropping just one game to win it 6â1. This set up a final-set decider which went with serve until the seventh game when Keothavong felt she had been given a wrong linecall and ended up being broken. She fought back to 5â5 but was broken again in the eleventh. Keothavong managed to save two match points but then, after saving two break points of her own, Vesnina hit an ace to seal victory and complete a match lasting almost two hours.
The second semi-final of the doubles competition was a match between American pair Julie Ditty and Carly Gullickson, and France's Nathalie Dechy partnering Italian Mara Santangelo. Santangelo and Dechy, bidding for their second title as a partnership following Rome Masters victory in 2007 advanced to the final 6â2, 6â4. Their final opponents will be Spaniards Nuria Llagostera Vives and Arantxa Parra Santonja.

Silver Spring Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station

The Silver Spring Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station is a historic building located at Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland. It was built in 1945 on the foundation of the original station, a Victorian-style brick structure built in 1878. It was designed in the Colonial Revival style and built from standardized plans developed for B&O stations in the mid-1940s. Amtrak's "Blue Ridge" previously served the station, and have since dropped the stop from its timetables.
Passenger train service at the station ended in 2000, and trains now stop at the nearby MARC station. ("See" Silver Spring (Washington Metro).) The 1945 station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 and restored in 2002.
The original 1940s waiting room furniture remains in the station, as are the original recessed fluorescent lighting fixtures. The Eastbound Waiting Room, a small rectangular building of similar design, stood on the south side of the tracks until it was lost to redevelopment in 2008. Originally built along with the station in 1945, it was razed and rebuilt in 1976, to make way for tracks laid for the Washington Metro. An underground pedestrian tunnel connecting the two buildings beneath the track bed still exists, but is closed to the public. The station is owned by Montgomery Preservation, Inc., a non-profit organization, which opens the building for tours.

Con Slobodchikoff

Constantine 'Con' Slobodchikoff is an animal behaviorist and conservation biologist. He is a professor at Northern Arizona University where he studies referential communication, using prairie dogs ("Cynomys gunnisoni") as a model species. Much of his recent research has shown a complex communicative ability of the Gunnison prairie dog alarm calls. In early 2008 he formed the Animal language Institute to create a place where people can find and share research in animal communication.
Background.
He was born in China to Russian Ã©migrÃ© parents, and moved to the United States as a young child with his parents, who settled in San Francisco. Slobodchikoffâs early love of biology was fostered by his membership in his teenage years in the Student Section of the California Academy of Sciences, where he went on numerous field trips to different habitats in California. He received an A. A. degree from City College of San Francisco in 1964, and a B. S. in 1966 and Ph. D. degree in 1971 both from the University of California, Berkeley. After receiving his Ph. D., Slobodchikoff joined the biology faculty of Northern Arizona University, where he remains today as a tenured professor. He also was a Fulbright Fellow and a Visiting Professor at Kenyatta University in Kenya in 1983.
Research.
His initial research involved the behavior and ecology of tenebrionid beetles and their response to vertebrate predators. However, in the mid-1980s he switched his research efforts to studying the social behavior and communication of prairie dogs. He has been decoding the communication system of alarm calls, and he and his students have found that prairie dogs have a sophisticated communication system that can identify the species of predator and provides descriptive information about the size, shape, and color of the individual predator animal. His research in prairie dog communication has also shown displacement, the ability to communicate about things that are not present. This finding challenges prior theories on animal communication, since only humans have been known to use this linguistic process. In addition, his work with prairie dogs suggests that they may have a "complex communication system that borders on language." Not only do they have a developed communication system as described above, they also have different escape behaviors in response to different predator calls. His research with the prairie dogs also helps to explain why animals have social behavior. Because these animals form a colony, they form a set of different social groups, which apparently exist for other reasons besides mating and may be a way to take advantage of limited resources. Con also writes a Dog Behavior Blog which gives some advice on how to solve behavior issues and has several short essays about some of the research about dogs and dog behavior.
Through Slobodchikoff's research, it has been found that prairie dogs also have the ability to construct new words referring to novel objects or animals in their environment, which is called productivity. Prior to the study, only humans have been recognized with the ability of productivity within a communication system. Slobodchikoff and his research team are currently taking a look at breaking down the grammar of prairie dogs through computer technology to better understand the nature of their vocalizations in comparison to the phoneme system used by humans. Through this approach, they have been able to find how these vocalizations are put together to construct word-like structures and further constructed to form sentences. 
Con Slobodchikoff has shown strong intention of preserving the habitats of prairie dogs. One specific area that has evidence of the destruction of their environment is New Mexico. An organization, Prairie Dog Pals has dedicated themselves to prevent the urban expansion that threatens the dogâs lifestyles. Prairie Dogs are seen as bothersome creatures to city employees. They are viewed as a threat to home owners and the general public by digging burrows into parks and playgrounds. Unfortunately, animal lovers are worried that their extinction will be the cause of the extinction of other creatures. Drastic measures such as poisoning, bulldozing and drowning their habitats have been implemented by the cityâs urban expansion workers. This has caused a major push in Con Slobodchikoff research, because of his drive to inform society of how intelligent these remarkable creatures are, and how they can really can contribute to further research.
Slobodchikoff has examined the language, communication, and social behavior of prairie dogs for more than twenty years. He selected prairie dogs as the main focus of his research because he believes they have a high degree of social behavior and are easy to study due to their close proximity. The prairie dogs live near the university that Slobodchikoff teaches, Northern Arizona University. He has taken what he has learned from the findings of his research with prairie dogs to offer consultations about problems that pets may have with behavior and offer advice to correct those problems. He has also offered dog training classes based on what he has learned in his research. 
Published Writings.
Slobodchikoff has published numerous papers in animal behavior, ecology, and evolution. One of his better known papers on evolution was published with Thomas G. Whitham in 1981 in the journal "Oecologia": Evolution of individuals, plant-herbivore interactions, and mosaics of genetic variability: the adaptive significance of somatic mutations in plants. 
A seminal paper on prairie dog communication was published in 1991 in the journal "Animal Behaviour": Semantic information distinguishing individual predators in the alarm calls of Gunnison's prairie dogs.
He has been editor or co-editor of several books including: "Concepts of Species";
"A New Ecology: Novel Approaches to Interactive Systems";
Media.
Slobodchikoffâs work with the prairie dog communication system has been featured in a number of video productions, magazines, radio interviews, and newspaper accounts. His video appearances included: NBC Dateline, ABC World News with Peter Jennings, CNN, Country Canada, Quantum (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), Teirzeit (Belgian-German TV), BBC, Turner Broadcasting, Brixen Productions (Discovery Channel), Evolve (History Channel). Radio interviews have been with: NPR All Things Considered, BBC radio, PBS Flagstaff, Phoenix, Santa Fe, Idaho, and Colorado. Magazine stories about his work have appeared in: Smithsonian Magazine, National Geographic, People Magazine, Discover Magazine, the Phoenician, Best Friends Magazine, Boyâs Life, Readerâs Digest. Newspaper stories about his work have appeared in: LA Times, Boston Globe, Denver Post, Arizona Republic, Arizona Daily Sun, Arizona Daily Star, Washington Post, NY Times, among others.

In the episode titled "Even Fairy Tale Characters Would Be Jealous" Lenz's character Haley James Scott's friend Peyton Sawyer produces a massive USO concert at the military base where her brother is stationed.
Notably, Lenz as character Haley James Scott, sang songs featured in Everly's EP in the episode titled "We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me)". In this very special episode Chad Michael Murray penned a homage to the classic films of the 1940s. Karen's CafÃ© is transformed into a glamorous nightclub with Lucas Scott (Chad Michael Murray) as its proprietor and Haley James Scott as the cabaret singer.
Album success.
Receiving an excited response from fans, "Mission Bell" reached the #1 spot on CD Baby, an online music store specializing in the sale of physical compact discs and digital music downloads from independent musicians directly to consumers.

Valentinus Lublinus, also known as Walenty Lublin, was a 16th-century Polish physician and editor of medical texts. He was a student of Johannes Baptista Montanus at the University of Padua, and collected, edited and published several volumes of his teacher's lectures two years after Montanus's death. One of these volumes was "explanations" of Galen, published in 1556.
The surname Lublinus indicates that he was from Lublin, a center of literary and intellectual activity during the Polish Renaissance. Lublinus's Latinized name also sometimes appears with the "cognomen" Polonus, an additional toponym to indicate that he was from Poland.

Kirkegata (Levanger)

Kirkegata () is the main street of the town of Levanger which is located in Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag county, in the middle of Norway. The street is parted on the middle by "Ãverparken" with the famous fountain and the town square, referred to as Torget by locals. The current/"modern" street plot of Levanger was laid out by the Swedish king Carl III in the early 19th century.
The street is laid out in an axis from the Mo farm area in the southwest to the northeast. It passes by the Levanger videregÃ¥ende skole, the old HÃ¸gskolen i Levanger (now part of Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag University College), past the Levanger Church (hence the name Kirkegata), down to the Levangerselva bridge, the lower harbour area, and the old Levanger slaughter house. At the northeastern end of the road, it joins Norwegian County Road 774. 
Character.
Wooden houses.
Most of the buildings facing Kirkegata are old wooden houses of a very fine and distinct character, constructed towards the end of the 19th century, following the last of the great fires of Levanger (in 1848, 1863 and 1897). The last fire prompted new and better fire protection measures, such as a firewall between each house. The general high amount of fine wooden houses in Levanger, has earned Levanger the status as national wooden house town in Norway. Some fine wooden houses were demolished and replaced by modern buildings in the 1950s-1970s and even later.
Other distinctive buildings.
Not all of the old houses lining Kirkegata are old wooden houses. The old Levanger bank building is constructed from brick. The only proper hotel in downtown Levanger, Backlund Norlandia hotel, is to be found in Kirkegata 41. The modern Backlund is a multi-story brick building erected after the old one was destroyed in a fire. The old Backlund hotel was famous for having housed the Swedish king Oscar II. The new one housed the Norwegian king Olav V in the 1960s. A modern spa hotel, Levanger Fjordhotell and Spa, is to be constructed down at the harbour area, a part of a gentrification process, including the transformation of the old TrÃ¸nder Mat factory (a meat processing plant) into high class apartments.
Dining.
Numerous cafÃ©s, pubs, and bars are located along Kirkegata. No39 is a cafe in the ground floor of Backlund hotel, that offers an outdoor area during summertime. Oskars Irish Pub is an Irish themed pub, offering beer and whiskey. They can also offer an outdoor area during summer.

Saina

Saina (SaÃ¯na, Sayena,Sayna) is a female name which originated from Greece. It is also found in Iran. However, this name is somewhat uncommon in Iran because it stands for Simorgh ("Simurgh", "Simurg", "Phoenix"). "Simorgh", being a "mythological creature", is mostly in shape of a bird who descended to earth from heaven, is a symbol for all that is good and pure, making the name a representation of everything that is heavenly. Women with this name are often referred to as having a heavenly behaviour and are interested in philosophy and public welfare.

Seneca Quarry

Seneca Quarry is a historic site located at Seneca, Montgomery County, Maryland. It is located along the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal on the north bank of the Potomac River, just west of Seneca Creek. The quarry was the source of stone for two Potomac River canals: the Potowmack Canal (opened in 1802, and officially known as the Great Falls Skirting Canal) on the Virginia side of Great Falls; and the C&O Canal, having supplied red sandstone for the latter for locks 9, 11, 15 - 27, and 30, the accompanying lock houses, and Aqueduct No. 1, better known as Seneca Aqueduct, constructed from 1828 to 1833. 
Seneca red sandstone, also known as redstone, formed during the late Triassic age, 230 to 210 million years ago. "The current geological name is Poolesville Member of Manassas Sandstone." Iron oxide gives the sandstone its rust color. It was prized for its ease of cutting, durability and bright color.
The stone quarried here for the Smithsonian Castle was originally described as "lilac grey" in color when quarried," but turned red as it weathered.
Numerous quarries operated on the one-mile stretch of the Potomac River west of Seneca Creek. The C&O Canal provided a way for the heavy sandstone to reach the Washington, DC market, and the quarry's success is attributed to the canal. The Peter family of Georgetown, which built Tudor Place, owned the quarry from 1781 until 1866. John P.C. Peter, a great-grandson of Martha Washington, made the quarry into a commercial success by utilizing the C&O and winning the bid to supply red sandstone for the Smithsonian Castle, constructed 1847-1855. Peter built the stonecutting mill, drawing power from the adjacent canal turning basin. He also built a miniature of Tudor Place near the quarry called Montevideo, now owned by the Kiplinger family.
Seneca Quarry provided the stone for hundreds of buildings around the Washington, DC area, including houses in the Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan area, the James Renwick, Jr-designed Trinity Episcopal Church (1849; demolished 1936), Luther Place Memorial Church (1873), and the D.C. Jail in the 1870s. The Government Quarry nearby provided stone for the parapet of the Union Arch Bridge, better known as the "Cabin John Bridge," and the Washington Aqueduct Dam at Great Falls. 
After the American Civil War, the Seneca Sandstone Company purchased the quarry in 1866, expanding the stonecutting mill in 1868, but went bankrupt in 1876 after financial mismanagement, sometimes referred to as the "Seneca Stone Ring Scandal." It was closed for seven years. In 1883, the Potomac Red Sandstone Company reopened the quarry but only operated until 1889, when the Great Flood of 1889 knocked out the C&O Canal for two years. Baltimore quarry operator George Mann purchased the Seneca quarry in 1891 and operated it for the next decade. By 1901, quarrying operations had stopped as the quality of the rock diminished and Victorian architecture was no longer in vogue. 
Seneca Quarry is now overgrown with sycamore trees and dense brush such as wild rose, such that it is impenetrable much of the year. It is best visited in winter. The property includes ruins of the stonecutting mill, located at "the Junction of Seneca Creek and the C&O Canal, just NW of the aqueduct" and the restored quarry master's house, located within Seneca Creek State Park. The quarry proper, Seneca Aqueduct, and the quarry cemetery are all part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. As of March 2013, the mill, " is in "ruins, standing The quarry falls within the boundaries of the Seneca Historic District.
Seneca Quarry was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

South Terrebonne High School

South Terrebonne High School is a public secondary school in Bourg, Louisiana, United States. It is a part of the Terrebonne Parish School District.
South Terrebonne High currently serves the coastal communities of Bourg, Chauvin, Montegut, Pointe-aux-Chenes, and the eastern part of incorporated Houma in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. It was the second high school built in Terrebonne Parish after the parish's sole high school, Terrebonne High School, became overcrowed with an influx of students from the lower reaches of the parish.
The school was designed by the architectural firm of Curtis and Davis, who later designed the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans.
South Terrebonne High was officially opened in 1961, with the first graduating class commencing in 1962. Most of the first graduating class were transferred into South Terrebonne for their senior year when the district was reapportioned, and some students delayed their graduation from Terrebonne High in 1961 in order to graduate in the first graduating class at the new school in 1962.
Prior to 1988, South Terrebonne housed students in their sophomore, junior, or senior year. Once Ellender Memorial High School was expanded from a junior high school to become the parish's fourth high school, freshmen were then added to South Terrebonne. Today, the school houses over 1,000 students in grades 9-12, with 8th graders added in special education or advanced gifted classes.
Athletics.
South Terrebonne competes in District 8 of Class AAAA (the second highest classification level of athletics in the state of Louisiana). The school participates in varsity, junior varsity, and freshman athletics in 11 sports.

Table Tops

Table Tops was a free daily newspaper produced for Australian Army personnel, published in the Atherton Tableland Training Area in Queensland, Australia, with regional editions produced abroad for serving personnel.
"Table Tops" was produced by the staff of the "AIF News", who were part of the First Australian Army Printing and Press Unit. The newspaper was produced seven days a week: weekday and Saturday editions were four pages long while Sunday editions were eight pages. The pages were demy quarto size. Occasional special editions were produced in addition to the daily editions. It contained news on the progress of the war, as well as home news such as current events in Australia and sport results.
It was published in Atherton during the Second World War, where it was typeset on Linotype machines and then printed on an old Wharfedale printing press on overnight print runs so that the paper was ready to be sent to units for breakfast. During the Second World War, the editor of "Table Tops" was Major C. H. Cheong.
Regional editions were produced abroad for serving personnel. These were produced in camps, with mobile generators and truck-mounted printing equipment. News was collected by listening to short-wave radio broadcasts from India, Hawaii, the BBC and Australia. These regional editions were produced at places such as Morotai in the Maluku Islands, and in Balikpapan and Brunei in Borneo.

Cheater, Cheater

"Cheater, Cheater" is the debut single from country/bluegrass duo Joey + Rory, from their debut album, "The Life of a Song". The song debuted on the Hot Country Songs chart at #57 for the chart week of September 27, 2008. Co-written by both Joey and Rory, the song was originally recorded by country group Bomshel, whose version failed to chart after its release as a single.
Content.
"Cheater, Cheater" is an up-tempo song with bluegrass influences, including accompaniment from Dobro, mandolin and fiddle. The female narrator, in the lyric, asks her unfaithful partner where he met "that no-good, white-trash ho" (i.e., his mistress). Several remixes have been made for the song, including the Sleighbell Mix and King Mix. The Sleighbell Mix was released as a Christmas promo single, in which the word ho becomes ho-ho-ho and bells are added to the music. The song was available on iTunes as the "Free Single of the Week" between October 14th and the 21st, 2008.
Critical reception.
Reviews of "Cheater, Cheater" have been positive. Roughstock.com said that "'Cheater, Cheater' is an honest-to-God pure country song that jumps out of the speakers. With lyrics that find Joey as the woman who's been cheated onâ¦ three minutes of tempo and while it remains to be seen whether radio will embrace this truly country duo, songs like 'Cheater, Cheater"'are what makes country music what it is: honest, true to life music."
The 9513 critic Matt C. gave the song a "thumbs up" rating. He called it a "delightfully acoustic barn-burner" and said "itâs arresting to hear what nearly qualifies as a bluegrass song performed by a straight-laced contemporary country singer", although he criticized Joey's "oddly phrased and somewhat colorless" lead vocals and Rory's "barely audible" backing vocals.
Music video.
A music video directed by Peter Zavadil was released to accompany the song. In the video, Joey is seen following Rory around, confronting him over cheating on her. Mixed in are scenes of the duo performing the song together in happy moods. The video ends with a cameo from Naomi Judd playing the "ho".
The video debuted at #20 on the CMT "Top Twenty Countdown" in mid-November, and reached a peak of #15 for the week of January 9, 2009.
Chart performance.
The Joey + Rory version of "Cheater, Cheater" debuted at #57 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart for the chart week of September 27, 2008, and entered the Top 40 in its eighth week. The song peaked at #30 in January 2009, spending 20 weeks on the chart.

Out of Control Tour

The Out of Control Tour was the fifth concert tour by British all-female pop group Girls Aloud. It supported their fifth studio album "Out of Control". Initially, just ten dates in bigger arenas were announced in November 2008. Due to demand, more dates were added. Girls Aloud performed thirty-two dates across the United Kingdom and Ireland. The tour commenced on 24 April 2009 at Manchester Arena, with the final show on 6 June 2009 in Newcastle's Metro Radio Arena.
The show was divided into five unique sections with distinct costumes, including the encore. Each member of the group had their own respective platform. During the show, Girls Aloud use pole dancing techniques and themes of BDSM. Most of the songs performed come from "Out of Control", but earlier singles and cover versions were also performed. Like 2008's Tangled Up Tour, there is a smaller stage in the centre of the arena that Girls Aloud perform on during the show. Absent Elk, Emma Deigman, Girls Can't Catch and Julian Perretta were opening acts during the tour.
Background and development.
Girls Aloud announced their plans to tour in support of "Out of Control" in mid-November 2008. Initially, just ten tour dates in bigger arenas across the United Kingdom and Ireland were announced, with tickets going on sale on 14 November. Due to arenas selling out, Girls Aloud added a number of live shows to the tour. Cheryl Cole's hometown of Newcastle sold particularly well, with the group scheduled to play a record-breaking four nights. Girls Aloud were also scheduled to play three dates in Belfast, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, and four dates in London and Manchester. The group performed three nights in O2 Arena and two at Wembley Arena.
Nadine Coyle said, "We can't wait to get back out on the road to see our fans. We'll play the music that we love from the past albums. And it'll be great doing the new songs in those arenas, too." The group began rehearsals "straight after Christmas". They took pole dancing lessons to prepare for a routine. Cheryl Cole and Kimberley Walsh missed some tour rehearsals, citing exhaustion following their charity climb of Mount Kilimanjaro for Comic Relief.
Girls Aloud's rider includes treadmills, various exercise machines, and scented candles, as well as a physical therapist and masseuse. Each individual member has her own respective hairdresser and make-up artist.
Emma Deigman was confirmed as the supporting act during the tour. Other support acts included Julian Perretta, Girls Can't Catch and Absent Elk. In addition to their own dates, Girls Aloud and American rapper Jay-Z were support acts for Coldplay's Viva la Vida Tour at Wembley Stadium on 18 September 2009.
Concert synopsis.
Girls Aloud start the show with their number one BRIT Award winning single "The Promise", "burst up out of the floor wearing long, spangly dresses which they whipped off to reveal short mini skirts." They rise above the stage on individual hydraulic podiums. Girls Aloud then perform "Out of Control" album track "Love Is the Key," followed by "Biology" and another album track entitled "Miss You Bow Wow." The dancers perform to an extended instrumental of "Miss You Bow Wow" while Girls Aloud change.
During the show's second section, Girls Aloud wear black-and-white kimono-inspired playsuits. They perform "The Loving Kind", followed by a revival of "Waiting," an album track from 2005's "Chemistry". They then sing hit single "Love Machine" and "Rolling Back the Rivers in Time." During a performance of "Untouchable," Girls Aloud "fly" on a platform to a smaller, specially-constructed stage in the centre of the arena. They perform "Sexy! No No Noâ¦" with a dance break containing interpolations of Rihanna's "Disturbia". They perform a cover of James Morrison's "Broken Strings". The album track "Love Is Pain" is performed, followed by "Call the Shots", as Girls Aloud return to the main stage.
Following a video introduction, "Revolution in the Head" is performed. Girls Aloud then perform debut single "Sound of the Underground". Girls Aloud pole dance for a performance of the album track "Fix Me Up" in "skintight dominatrix gear." A cover of Britney Spears' "Womanizer" features BDSM themes in its performance. The girls wear "tiny PVC outfits" and use whips on their dancers. This section ends with "Something Kinda Ooooh". Girls Aloud return in butterfly sequined corsets for their final number. The encore of the show is a megamix of Girls Aloud's other hits, consisting of: "The Show", "Wake Me Up", "Jump", "No Good Advice", "Can't Speak French", and a reprise of "The Promise."

Broadcast and recordings.
The show was filmed on 24 May 2009 at The O2 Arena in London. On 15 June 2009, "The Sun" announced that the show would be broadcast on Sky1 in August, and later announced that it as airing on 8 August at 8pm. A DVD called "Out of Control: Live From The O2 2009" was released on 5 October 2009, with a Blu-ray following on 12 October respectively. As well as the full live show, the DVD included several bonus features, including a Girl-cam that allowed the viewer to follow their favourite band member as she performed a song on tour. Also included are the videos for the singles "The Promise", "The Loving Kind" and "Untouchable", as well as the tour screen visuals and interviews. A limited edition was also available from Girls Aloud's official website, including a live CD to accompany the DVD/Blu-ray.
In a review of the DVD, Phil Udell of "State" said, "Girls Aloud are great pop stars. [â¦] their fourth live DVD finds them bestriding the live pop experience in high heels. [â¦] It's hugely entertaining." CBBC Newsround gave the release three stars out of five, stating, "It's definitely a hit for fans, but it's unlikely to convert anyone who isn't already into their music."
The live video album reached number two on the music DVD chart in its first week, falling to the number three in its second week. The DVD remained at number three in its third week. It returned to number two the following week. The DVD was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry.
Critical reception.
The Out of Control Tour received mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Phil Udell of "State" wrote, "As a spectacle, it's second to none â opening with the five raised high into the air on moving plinths and taking in floating stages, dancers, pyrotechnics, costume changes, brass sections [â¦] some of the best pop songs this side of the sixties." A reviewer from the "Daily Mirror" stated that "the slick routines proved why they're the UK's No1 girl band." David Balls of Digital Spy called it Girls Aloud's "most spectacular live show yet." Lauren Mulvenny of "The Belfast Telegraph" wrote, "the fiery five-piece proved themselves again as the queens of the pop anthem." Gillian Orr of "The Independent" gave the show three stars out of five, but felt that Girls Aloud should have performed more of their older hit singles as opposed to newer album tracks. Dave Simpson of "The Guardian" also awarded three stars out of five. Writing for "City Life", Simon Donohue comments that "they sing, dance, smile and wave as though they each have an extra set of lungs and a monopoly on confidence."
The show was dubbed Girls Aloud's "raunchiest performance ever" due to provocative performances that employ pole dancing techniques and BDSM. Mulvenny wrote, "The show got even sexier when the costumes took a dominatrix twist [â¦] alongside raunchy routines with shirtless male backing dancers."

J-113,397

J-113,397 is an opioid analgesic drug which was the first compound found to be a highly selective antagonist for the nociceptin receptor, also known as the ORL-1 receptor. It is several hundred times selective for the ORL-1 receptor over other opioid receptors, and its effects in animals include preventing the development of tolerance to morphine, the prevention of hyperalgesia induced by intracerebroventricular administration of nociceptin (orphanin FQ), as well as the stimulation of dopamine release in the striatum, which increases the rewarding effects of cocaine, but may have clinical application in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Miki Mizuasa

Life and career.
Miki Mizuasa was born June 11, 1980 and has been active in adult video work in Japan since 2004. The box covers from several of her videos have her name as Miki Miasa and she did at least one video early in her career as Miki Fuda. She has been called "one of the most popular transsexual performers in Japan". Mizuasa is a pre-operative transsexual, in that she has transitioned to female in all respects except undergoing genital surgery. The Japanese slang term for such individuals is "new half" (ãã¥ã¼ãã¼ã) and this term is also used for this genre of Japanese porn. It is equivalent to the English porn term "shemale" and both are considered pejorative when applied to individuals.
Mizuasa has made videos with other transsexual actresses, including several with Hime Tsukino, but she has also appeared with mainstream male and female actors engaging in sex both actively and passively. In 2006, she was in "Hotaru Akane, New Half, and I" with prolific AV actress Hotaru Akane and in 2008 in "First and Last Time An Nanba & Triple She-Male Ganbang Opera Special" with idol An Nanba. A 2008 SOD video "New Half Public Bath", co-starring Hime Tsukino, has the actresses at a Japanese public bath being welcomed in both the male and female sections and having sex with both clienteles. The steamy action is all captured on "hidden cameras". Mizuasa made her first "uncensored" video (without the usual mosaic pixelation to obscure the genitals) for Oriental Dream in May 2008. The video, "J-Girls With Cocks", co-stars Hime Tsukino and is released internationally by V&R International. Starting in August 2008, Mizuasa has made a number of movies for the AV studio Cross with Maki Tomoda, Miruku Aima, and others, several of them directed by Dragon Nishikawa.
In late 2008, she also started working with US company Grooby Productions for their website SheMaleJapan.com in a series of uncensored photo shoots.
Transsexual videos are still a fairly small niche market in Japanese pornography - in September 2011, major video distributor DMM (part of the Hokuto Corporation) listed nearly 1200 videos with the "new half" tag out of an inventory of almost 160,000 videos - but they are now reaching the mainstream market and have increased in popularity and sales. With this new popularity, several actresses have emerged as true AV Idols, including Mizuasa, Hime Tsukino, Maria Tominaga and Miruku Aima As a measure of her status in the AV world, Mizuasa was selected as one of 12 nominees for the Best Actress award at the 2007 Adult Broadcasting Awards In addition, two of her 2007 videos were nominated by their studios as entries in the 2008 AV Grand Prix contest, "The Best Triple She-Male" with Haruka Yabuki and Maria Tominaga from Opera, and the transsexual compilation video "Shemale & Celebrity" from Alpha International.

Leonardo's Notebook

Leonardo's Notebook is a popular liberal blog in South Carolina that is consistently ranked in the top 10 blogs of influence in that state. Leonardo's Notebook was the featured blog of the week in November 2007 as compiled by The State Newspaper in Columbia, SC. Leonardo's Notebook is consistently referenced by South Carolina news aggregator Political Net News and Blognet News.
The blog's content, from a center-left perspective, is concerned around state and national politics but also has emphases in religion, sexuality, and popular culture.
The author of the blog is Matthew Butler who writes pseudononymously as Mattheus Mei a homonymous latinization of his college alias. He caused controversy in late 2008 after leveling harsh criticism on much of South Carolina's ruling republican establishment. Another influential blog, amongst conservatives, "the Palmetto Scoop", led the charge to expose the actual identity of the author.
In August 2008, the author joined with other progressive bloggers in South Carolina and became known as "the coalition of the willing" an ironic name based on the coalition of nations that were to follow the US into Iraq. Efforts were made to create an umbrella website for progressive bloggers in South Carolina. Two ideas emerged, an internet news magazine and a diary-styled site. Leonardo's Notebook joined with the author of Waldo Lydecker's Journal in creating L'Espere.com which is still in slow release and planning stage. Other members of the coalition went on to create the wildly successful Indigo Journal a diary based site similar to Daily Kos.

<doc id="20143457" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20143457" title="List of Balto characters">
List of Balto characters

This is a list of characters from the movie Balto and its sequels.
Main characters.
Balto.
Balto is a Wolfdog who got separated from his mother when he was young and was found and raised by Boris, the Russian snow goose.
Jenna.
Jenna is a husky and is Balto's mate and mother of Aleu, Kodi, Dingo, Saba and two other pups. She was voiced by Bridget Fonda in the first movie, and Jodi Benson in the two sequels.
Physical Appearance.
Jenna has dark red fur, which most of her puppies received, and usually wears a dark orange bandanna around her neck. She also has creamish white fur on her underbelly, legs, face, chest and tail. Jenna's character design was based on movie actress, Audrey Hepburn.
Personality.
Jenna has loved Balto since they met. When Balto, along with Muk, Luk and Boris left to save "Nome", she, followed their scent. She saved Balto from a wild bear, and just before she and all of Balto's companion's left (due to Jenna's injured paw), Jenna gave Balto her bandanna. When Balto returned with medicine, they officially became mates.
Jenna usually stays behind on Balto's adventures, despite asking to help. Jenna also cared a lot for her puppies, but was willing to find them homes after 8 weeks. 
Jenna also disliked Steele for his remarks about Balto, and his arrogant attitude, and always stuck up for Balto whenever she was there, even scolding Steele and calling him a "glory-hound." 
Though she never said anything about the flirtatious remarks that Steele tried on her, she always turned him down. "I don't know Steele, suddenly I lost my appetite" Steele asked her out
Jenna is very kind and gentle, and is very protective not only of her pups, but also of her owner, Rosy. When Rosy's hat fell out of her hand and into the path of Steele and his team, as Rosy tried to reach for it, Jenna grabbed her coat from behind; Balto later got the hat. She is kindhearted but also rather intelligent, as she was the only one in Nome that Steele was unable to fool.
Unbeknownst to Rosy, Jenna is also very cunning (tricking Steele into burning his tail by using his infatuation of her against him), and even has fight instincts in her; she helped fight off a wild bear that was menacing Balto and the others, although her right paw ended up hurt.
Biography.
Jenna was sold to Rosie when she was only 8 weeks old. Jenna mentioned this in "". Jenna first met Balto when he saved her master's hat (there is some doubt of this, as they already knew one another by name)
She had befriended Balto and after he saved Rosy, she decided to spend the rest of her life with him and in the second movie, she gave birth to a litter of pups.
When Aleu ran away Jenna attempted to follow Balto but he insisted that she stay behind, and that it was a father/daughter thing. When Balto was chosen to help Kodi save his job a few years later, she encouraged Balto to help. 
Balto was worried that he would let the team down and that he was not a hero, but Jenna reassured him that if he could save a whole town, then he could help save Kodi's job. After Balto left to save Duke by himself, Jenna scolded Kodi for letting Balto go by himself and convinced Kodi to follow him.
Boris.
Boris Goosinov (called Uncle Boris by Muk, Luk, Aleu, and sometimes Balto) is a Russian snow goose who raised Balto from a pup. He speaks with a heavy Russian accent (but in the close captions for Balto II: Wolf Quest, it says that Boris has a Yiddish accent). 
He is voiced by Bob Hoskins in the first film, and Charles Fleischer in the direct-to-video movies. (Hoskins and Fleischer respectively portrayed Eddie Valiant and the voice of Roger Rabbit in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?".) 
In the 1st film, Boris mentions his last name is "Goosinov" ("Heal, boy! Boris Goosinov is no spring chicken!").
Physical Appearance.
Boris has the appearance of the average snow goose. White feathers with black tipped wings and headdress. Boris is afraid of heights.
Personality.
Boris in the first film, at first, was dismissive of Balto's attempts to "find a dog he doesn't like to save a town full of people that doesn't like him".
However, when Balto showed him the sick children, he quickly changed his attitude and accompanied him until he had to help Muk and Luk return Jenna home after she was injured. 
He had great faith in Balto when he left, telling him: "A dog cannot make the journey alone, but maybe a wolf can". Boris also was afraid of the local bully Steele. 
In the 2nd film, Boris told Balto that even though he didn't want to believe it, Aleu would be half-wolf. Boris was also revealed to be superstitious and believed in mystical stuff. In the 3rd film, he developed a crush on a goose named Stella, but lied about flying with her to hide his fear of heights.
Biography.
Boris was born in Russia. It is unknown how he ended up in Nome since he has a fear of heights. Sometime in Boris' life, he discovered a young Balto and raised him as his adoptive son. 
When Balto left to save Nome several years later, Boris waited for Balto's return. Boris became the pups' babysitter in the 2nd film. When Balto left to find Aleu, Boris once again waited for Balto's return with Jenna.
Two years later, he fell in love with a migrating snow goose named Stella. After Stella became mad with him, she chased him onto a plane which then crashed. 
Balto, Stella, Muk, and Luk eventually found Boris in the wreck-site and carried him back to Nome. Boris then made up with Stella and confessed to her his fear of heights. Later they became a couple.
Muk & Luk.
Muk and Luk are two polar bears who usually like to play pranks on Boris. They are presumably brothers. Most about Muk and Luk's origin is unknown. Muk and Luk live in the forests of Alaska. They are often seen visiting Boris and Balto.
Physical Appearance.
Muk and Luk resemble the Polar Bears indigenous to the Arctic Circle. Muk has a solid black nose while Luk's is red, and both have thick white fur coats. Muk is the smaller of the two while Luk maintains a large physic, yet glutton size and does not speak.
Personality.
Both Muk and Luk show very peculiar personalities and traits for their own species. Both are fun loving and care free. Seemingly the only thing they take serious in their lives is the well being of their friends in family. Particularly their "Uncle" Boris and Balto. Muk has shown to be the more intelligent of the two, but Luk also contributes mumbling words of wisdom on the given occasion. Unlike the average Polar Bears, Muk and Luk show no solid traits that usually pertain to the largest bears in America (possibly because they are still young). They always seem to find the best in every situation, no matter how grim it might be.
Biography.
Very little is told about the past lives of Muk and Luk before the events in "Balto". During the film both are known to the goose Boris and Balto. They seem to have been separated from their family at a young age, and were taken in by a probably reluctant Boris. They now refer to him as their Uncle and only remaining family. During the events of "", they continue to share a strong familial bond with Boris, as well as Balto's family. They remain behind in Balto's quest to find his daughter.
Later on during "", they continue to reside in the wilderness around Nome. They also aid Balto in his quest to rescue the stranded pilot Duke from the Alaskan Wilderness, telling him the exact location of his downed bush plane. After aiding Balto in a confrontation with two wild Bull Moose, they return to a life of little cares and pestering of their Uncle and closest friends.
Aleu.
Aleu, is a wolf-dog hybrid and the daughter of Balto and Jenna. Aleu appeared in "Wolf Quest" and made a second appearance as a puppy during Balto's flashback in the song "You Don't Have To Be A Hero" during "Wings of Change". Her name might come from the "Aleutian Islands", off the coast of Alaska.
Appearance.
Aleu has sandy-grey fur, with a lighter underbelly and blue eyes. While mostly looking like her father she shares some similarities to her mother.
Personality.
She is very stubborn and brave, prone to not listening to her father. She was also disdainful of her wolf blood (though she eventually learns to accept it). 
Although she never realized it, Aleu acted more like a wolf than a dog; she had a reputation for being aggressive and had a high prey drive and stronger predatory instincts than a common dog. It is unknown how she developed her prey drive, as neither Balto nor Jenna possessed a prey drive.
Despite a very emotional blow at the hands of her father, the two reconcile at the end of her journey, and she remains very closely tied to Balto despite leaving him perhaps forever. 
In most peoples hopes of Universal Studios is that they will make another movie about her returning home. She also has a friendship tied to Muk and Luk as well as her mother and family.
Biography.
Aleu was born to Balto and Jenna within the same litter as her brother Kodiak. She is most likely to be the youngest. She bore great resemblance to a wolf more so than her siblings and also acted more like a wolf unlike her more canine siblings. 
As a result, she was never adopted. Aleu spent a year with Balto and Jenna, one day believing that a human would adopt her for who she was.
After a nearly costly encounter with a local Inuit Hunter, Balto was forced to reveal to his daughter that she bore the physical appearances and characteristics of a wolf. 
Even more so then Balto himself. This caused Aleu a great deal of distress and emotional turmoil. She chose to run far from Nome, her father naturally giving chase alone despite Jenna's wishes. 
Aleu would eventually come into contact with a wolf pack led by Nava, which also included the extremely vicious wolf Niju.
Balto did manage to catch his daughter, but she refused to return to the life offered with her family at Nome. Through a series of spiritual events, Balto, Nava, and eventually Aleu herself come to realize with the aid of her spirit guide Maru that she was destined to lead the pack towards a better future. 
At the end of the events in "", she bids her father a very emotional farewell, informing him to deliver her best love to Jenna. 
She then disappears across the "Bering Sea". Her future and whereabouts are now unknown. It is unknown if she already has a mate in her clan. She has a strange supernatural power that allows her to have visions of the past or future, as well as read minds. 
This is shown by her eyes lighting up a bright yellow.
Kodi.
Kodiak (Kodi) is the son of Balto, and plays a major part in ', where he has a job as a local mail-dog. Kodi also had a cameo in ' as one of the puppies that is adopted. His name may be in reference to the "Kodiak Islands", off the coast of Alaska. Unlike Aleu, he and all of the other pups have no knowledge of their wolf ancestry.
Appearance.
Unlike his sister, Kodi mainly takes after his mother. His fur is dark red with a sandy underbelly. He has a white stripe that goes from between his eyes to the tip of his nose.
Personality.
Kodi has appeared to display a similar personality to Balto. Kodi has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, but also has his faults (such as allowing Balto to attempt a rescue mission into the Alaskan frontier alone for the sake of keeping his job). He remains fiercely loyal to his friends. Going to such heights such as forsaking his family's wishes to keep them content. He is also laid-back and cool-headed.
He has a strong drive and passion for sled racing and wishes to push himself to the limits due to events in his childhood, where he was physically the weakest of the entire litter (obviously the runt of the litter). Shares a strong bond with his father due again to his childhood experiences and is extremely proud to be his son.
Biography.
Kodiak was born to Balto and Jenna within the same litter as his sister's Aleu and Saba. It is unknown where he resides in the order of age but many fans consider him to be the youngest of the group although he is the oldest due to his larger size and mature voice.He is as younger than ralph and kirby but is still older than dusty. As a pup, Kodi was always ready to engage in activities with his brothers and sisters, but found himself unable to keep up with running activities. Although this left Kodi dismayed, never believing himself capable, this allowed him to build a closer relationship with his father Balto, who would run with his son constantly until the day he would finally outrun him.
Sometime between the events of "Wolf Quest" and "", or even before, Kodi attained a very high interest in the local mail team, specifically in becoming lead dog. Most likely due to his father's past with sled dog racing. Sometime during that period he attained a position on the mail team and displayed superb skills with his job.
During the events of "Wings of Change", Kodi displayed a wide variety of traits that showed how easily swayed he was by his friends. Such as valuing their position on the team and overall welfare over that of a human being's life. This trait colliding roughly with both his parents. Later on his true personality revealed itself when he chose to pursue and aid his father in rescuing the pilot Duke, over the initial wishes of his comrades. Kodi's future remains unknown, but it can be said that he continues with his mail duties and remains close to his parents in Nome.
Other Characters & Allies.
Nikki, Kaltag, & Star.
Nikki, Kaltag, and Star aided Balto in the run for the serum. Nikki is the oldest of the three and Star is the youngest of the three (but older than Kirby). The three were made very famous by their constant rags about Steele and other characters behind their backs (mainly between Nikki and Kaltag). Star joins in with a very random and straight to the point reply, resulting in a hit to the head by Kaltag, though once he saw it was coming and hit himself instead. Later on during the events of the relay, Balto would gain the trust and admiration of all three when he successfully leads them across the dangerous Alaskan wilderness and also by retrieving the medicine from the bottom of a deep ravine.
Star would make the infamous ""They should build a statue of him!"" comment at the conclusion of the film, which Kaltag agreed with instead of smacking him on the head. It is unknown what has become of the trio after the events in "Balto", for there is no mention or appearance of them in either "Wolf Quest" or "Wings of Change" (although there are brief appearances of Nikki and Kaltag in "Wings of Change": during the E.D.A.S where Kaltag barks from a window and Nikki barks from the far right corner of the street next to JOHN'S BAR). Kaltag is still golden, but Star is brown in the preview of the movie.
They were voiced respectively by Jack Angel (Nikki), Danny Mann (Kaltag), and Robbie Rist (Star).
Nava.
Nava is an elderly wolf who was the wise leader of the wolf pack and is the father of balto and was encountered by Balto and Aleu in "".
Physical Appearance.
Being very old among his pack (Around 9â11 years possibly), Nava's fur was a very dull Grey with his underbelly being pure white. Nava was also fairly larger than some of the others of his pack. He does not appear to bear any permanent markings.
Personality.
Nava was firm with his beliefs in the spiritual ways and laws of the pack, his more peaceful views coming into conflict with those of the younger and more militant wolf known as Niju. Nava also was shown to willingly hear everyone's opinion on something, including Niju's. He was instrumental in showing Aleu what she truly wanted in life, and discovered that it was she, not Balto, who was meant to lead the pack onwards.
Biography.
Nava first appeared as the shaman and Leader of a Wolf Pack. He tells his pack as well as Balto and Aleu that one day soon, they will be led by a new leader, "the one who is wolf but does not know."During the climax of the film, Nava was attacked by Niju and shoved into the ice cold waters beneath the ice. Although rescued by Balto and Aleu, he chose to remain behind on the Alaskan mainland with Balto; giving control of the pack's future and well being to Aleu.
After discussing the future with Balto, Nava informed him that he would find the also stranded Niju. Stating that they were still a pack and that they needed each other. The two bid a fond farewell, Nava disappearing into the wilderness. His current whereabouts are unknown. He has a supernatural power that allows him to fuse with the elements. It is said that Nava might be Balto's father. Balto's mother, Aniu changes into the raven and some say it might be possible that Nava changes into a husky, possibly Balto's missing father.
He was voiced by David Carradine.
Dusty, Kirby, & Ralph.
Three huskies who reside in the Alaskan town of Nome and serve as the traditional threesome that was evident in the two previous installments. All three dogs play a backup role in the third film ' as friends and fellow mail team members to Balto and Jenna's son Kodiak. Kirby appears to be the oldest of the group (but he's younger than Star) and Dusty the youngest of the group. All three are highly committed and proud of their jobs, a trait that plays a heavy impact upon Kodi throughout the course of the film.
Kirby is the cocky member of the trio and the lead dog on the sled team. He also insists that, as the lead dog, they need to defeat Duke and his bush plane in the race, but is easily passed up in favor of Balto. Ralph is the husky and more laid back of the trio, usually serving as the blunt of pranks yet voice of quiet reason and complaints. Dusty is the only female in this group. Because of this, some fans suggest that Dusty might potentially become a love interest for Kodi. 
All three dogs eventually supported Kodi's decision to help the human Duke, despite the fact he threatened to take their jobs away. They proceeded to aid Kodi and Balto in Duke's rescue. It is unknown what has become of them after "Wings of Change", but it can be assumed they all continue to run alongside Kodi on the mail team.
They are voiced respectively by Charity James, Carl Weathers, and Bill Fagerbakke.
Duke.
Duke was an air pilot who appeared in "Balto III: Wings of Change". Although friendly and very kind towards Balto and his friends, he pushed for a race between himself and the local mail team; as to determine which could carry the mail quicker. Although Duke had the advantage at the midway point of the race, a build up of ice on his plane's wings caused him to crash land deep in the Alaskan wilderness. Unknown to him, Boris had mistakenly boarded the plan after a run-in with Stella. He was injured in the crash, but was discovered by Balto who proceeded to return him to Nome. Without aid, Balto carried Duke as far as he was able, and nearly fell prey to the deep bowels of an ice canyon had it not been for the sudden arrival of his son Kodi and his fellow mail team dogs Dusty, Kirby, and Ralph.
Once returned to Nome, Duke decided to build another plane, and in honor of the canine who saved his life, he named it the ""Balto Flyer"". His final gift to Balto was the thrill of a flight high above the Alaskan landscape, something Balto truly wanted to experience.
He was voiced by veteran actor Keith Carradine.
Stella.

Then, Balto retrieved the hat and return it to her which she replies "Balto, what a crazy thing to do. To show off with a pretty girl." After Balto returned the hat, Rosy's father pulled her away from him and told her that he was part wolf. She still feel bad for Balto and told her father that he hurt his feelings after calling Balto for being a half wolf.
Later, Rosy caught Diphtheria along with the rest of the children in the town of Nome.
Rosy was cured after Balto arrived with the medicine. She was the only human in the town who accepted Balto while the citizen of Nome, including Rosy's own parents, hated and feared him.
70 years later, Rosy was a grandmother and told her granddaughter about the story of Balto. She was voiced by Juliette Brewer as child, and played by Miriam Margolyes as an adult. 
Rosy was mentioned several times during ', but was an off-screen character. Rosy had a cameo during the opening credits in '.
Rosy's parents.
Although Rosy liked Balto, her parents feared him. When Balto returned Rosy's hat, her father pulled her away from Balto and told her that Balto is part wolf. However, at the end of the first movie, the whole town rejoices when Balto returns with the medicine and the townspeople, including Rosy's parents, now see who he really is and lets him see Rosy after receiving her treatment.
It can be said that they continue to allow the previously untrustworthy Balto into their lives and home; seeing as how he fathered a litter of puppies with the family's prized husky Jenna.
Her father was voiced by William Roberts and her mother was voiced by Sandra Dickinson.
Aniu.
Aniu was Balto's apparently deceased mother. Balto was separated from Aniu at an early age and never saw her again. Aniu made an appearance in "", where she revealed herself as the black raven who had been guiding Balto the entire time in spirit and Balto when Balto fell off a cliff, trying to save the antitoxin. A topic of hot debate among Balto fans is that of the white wolf's appearance in the first Balto film; where she appeared to help him accept who he truly was. It is yet unknown if this wolf was meant to also be Balto's mother or simply a representative of the dormant heritage Balto continues to ignore up until that point of the film. Though it is finally revealed in Wolf Quest that she is indeed Balto's mother, himself calling her the latter.
She makes no appearance in "".
She was voiced by Monnae Michaell.
Muru.
Muru is Aleu's spirit guide and the son of Kahu and Quillaq. He has the appearance of a mouse in the "", and performs the song, "Who Are You". At the end of "Wolf Quest", he is seen sitting next to Aleu, and howling alongside her, forever ready to guide her in future endeavors.
He was voiced by actor Peter MacNicol.
Dixie & Sylvie.
Dixie and Sylvie are a pair of female dog gossipers in "Balto". Dixie is a Pomeranian and Sylvie is an Afghan Hound. Both appear to be good friends of Jenna and both also having a crush on Steele. They and the other dogs soon discovered Steele's true nature and turned their backs on him. In Wings of Change, Sylvie makes a cameo in the ally way with several other dogs.
Dixie and Sylvie are both voiced by Sandra Dickinson.
Mel & Dipsy.
Mel and Dipsy are 2 dogs who replaced Dixie and Slyvie in "". Mel is a paranoid Airedale Terrier while Dipsy is an obese and carefree Cocker Spaniel. Much like the original gossipers, both appear to be friends with Jenna. Mel and Dipsy are voiced by David Paymer and Kathy Najimy.
Doc.
Doc is an old Saint Bernard who appears in the first film. He first appears while telling the other dogs of Nome that Steele and his team had missed their second checkpoint and had become lost. Later when the other dogs learned that Steele that lied to them about Balto and the team being frozen to death in the storm, he turned his back on him. Doc later appears in the third film during the E.D.A.S. He is voiced by Donald Sinden.
Terrier.
The Terrier is a Scottish Terrier who appears in "Balto: Wolf Quest" who tells Balto that Jenna gave birth to some puppies. The Terrier is hyper-active and barks continuously which Boris gets annoyed by. He later appears during the E.D.A.S scene in Wings of Change. He is voiced by Rob Paulsen.
Villains.
Steele.
Steele is a handsome male Alaskan Malamute in "Balto". He was voiced by Jim Cummings and serves as the main antagonist.
Physical Traits & Appearance.
Despite remarks by his musher and others that Steele might be "losing his edge" (after losing to Balto at the beginning of the film), Steele still has remarkable strength and speed close to that of Balto's. 
He was able to survive a fall down a cliffside, knocked down a dead tree, burned by a furnace (thanks to Jenna) and smashed through a closed door while pinning both Balto and Jenna. 
Steele is an image of physical perfectness among the local dogs. He is covered in jet black fur with a pure white underbelly and face. It is hinted that he is also a pure-bred, pedigree Alaskan Malamute.
Personality.
Steele is proud, mean, and jealous representing all of which Balto despises. His hatred for Balto is made out of pure jealousy (as Balto beat him to the finish line).
He also likes Jenna, but she is more interested in Balto the pure-hearted instead which further strengthens Steele's hatred and jealousy towards Balto. He is also a crafty liar, claiming that Balto and the rest of the team had died and at the end of the film the undoing of his lies causes him to be shunned and hated by those who used to respect him. Steele had no chance of going back on the sled team for it is possible that Balto had replaced him.
Biography.
Steele was the lead dog on the best dog racing team in Nome, he first encountered Balto (in the movie Steele's behavior towards Balto is an obvious indication that they have met on prior occasions) after being defeated by the latter in a race while rescuing Rosy's hat. 
Out of jealousy, Steele felt Balto was a threat so he bullied Balto. When the town became sick, there was a relay race to choose who would be on the sled dog team that would relay the medicine. 
Despite being deliberately kicked off the course by a competitor, Balto was the rightful winner of the race (by taking a special & longer route to catch up), but right after the race ended, Steele tells Balto that he'll never be a sled dog which Jenna scolds Steele for being a glory-hound. 
Shortly after that, Steele stomped on Balto's paw as a musher reached to pet him, forcing Balto to growl in pain and bare his teeth, making the humans believe that the wolf-dog to be aggressive and dangerous especially with his teeth. 
This causes Balto to be disqualified from the race despite being the victor.
Steele became the leader of the sled team to return the medicine to "Nome", managing to lead the team successfully to "Nenana" and halfway back to Nome before becoming lost. 
Balto discovered Steele and his team at the edge of a large ravine. Despite Balto's pleas for Steele to let him help them back to Nome (knowing that the children would die if the medicine does not get there in time), Steele attacks Balto, making obvious he thinks Balto as a threat to his position.
Balto refused to fight back, but still managed to escape Steele who ends up tumbling off the nearby cliff in his unstable mindset when Steele grabbed for the orange bandana around Balto's neck that Jenna gave to Balto. 
Having demonstrated his good nature and noble intention to bring the serum back to Nome at all costs, Balto gains the unconditional support of the other dogs on the team. They pick up the trail and head back without Steele.
Despite his state, Steele managed to follow Balto's trail back to Nome, along the way marking all of the trees to disorient him. On his return to Nome he claimed that Balto and the rest of the team had frozen to death and that Balto had fallen off of a cliff and also stating that Balto made Steele promise to take care of Jenna. 
Then, Jenna realizes that Balto would have never told Steele such a thing and tells all the other dogs who believe Steele's story that he's lying. Steele's strategy initially managed to catch Balto off his guard, resulting in him becoming lost as well. 
Despite this, Balto manages to believe in who he truly is, catches on to Steele's trick and follows the trail he himself had marked (using only his smell) back to Nome. 
Balto's return results in him being accepted as a beloved hero and the undoing of Steele's lies cause the other dogs of Nome to consider Steele as a glory hound and a jealous liar, leaving him behind alone in the boiler room as he tried to explain to them but they angrily refuse to listen at the climax of the movie. 
This is a complete reversal of their roles in the beginning of the movie where Steele was the town's most popular dog and Balto was the hated outcast.
It is unknown what became of Steele after the events in "Balto" for he is never seen or mentioned in the sequels ' or '. 
However Phil Weinstein explained that in the original script for Wings of Change, Steele would be one of the volunteers who would help Balto on his search for Duke.
Niju.
Niju was a young and vicious wolf and the main antagonist in "".
Physical Traits & Appearance.
Niju was impressively built, being the second largest (Nuk being larger due to his massive appetite) and almost certainly being the strongest member of the wolf pack which allowed him to intimidate and defeat other wolves, easily tackling and overpowering Aleu and throwing off Nava. His fur was brown with a greyish blue underbelly. His only markings were dark patches around his eyes. In the film, his whiskers were purposely made more noticeable.
Personality.
Unlike the elderly leader Nava, Niju was a very militant and arrogant wolf, fully willing to break the rules of the land and steal for what he desired, though seemingly doing so because of the desire to live. He was also shown to suffer from a fear of change (cainotophobia) which probably caused his cruel actions as Nava claimed that Niju would willingly starve or die than leave his homeland.
Biography.
Niju planned to take over the wolf pack with the aid of his followers, Nuk, Yak, and Sumac. Eventually the wolf pack started to turn towards Niju and started to follow him, but when the ice bridge that led to the caribou formed, the entire pack including Nuk, Yak, and Sumac turned back to Nava, Balto, Aleu. Niju also attempted to kill the pack leader Nava as well as Aleu, but his plans were foiled by Balto. When Niju was given the opportunity to lead the pack, his "fear Of change" got the better of him and he fled into the forest. Nava claimed to Balto after they were off the ice that he would go and find Niju and that "one would not be whole without the other."
Niju was voiced by veteran voice actor Mark Hamill.
Nuk, Yak, & Sumac.
Nuk, Yak, and Sumac were three wolves who served as the replacement for the original trio and Niju's followers in "".
Nuk, who while is the largest, is also the least intelligent member, personally claiming he'd rather just eat than use his brain. Yak seems to be the most intelligent, but seems to have an increasing difficulty with fleas. Sumac appears to be the smallest and most skittish individual, as well as laughing frequently. They have tufts of hair on the tips of their ears like a lynx and a bobcat.
Nuk, Yak, and Sumac refused to continue forth with Niju's evil plan when they finally realized the truth of the situation around them. The three aided Aleu in her return to the ice flow, resulting in her takeover of the pack's future. They disappeared across the ocean with Aleu and the rest of the wolves.
Nuk, Yak, and Sumac were voiced by Joe Alaskey, Jeff Bennett, and Rob Paulsen respectively.
Grizzly Bear.
A giant dangerous, and very angry Grizzly Bear appears in the original film "Balto" and "", and is the secondary main antagonist. During the wolf-dog's journey to find the missing relay anti-toxin team. The bear appeared to be stalking the group consisting of Balto, Boris, and Muk and Luk for several moments before Balto finally caught scent of the danger. A fierce confrontation erupted between the crazed giant and Balto.
Although small and more agile, the wolf-dog was unable to avoid the behemoth; becoming trapped and nearly crushed beneath its paw. Had it not been for the swift arrival of Jenna, Balto would have easily been killed. Still relentless, the Grizzly injured Jenna and managed to engage Balto once more. Having learned a strategy, Balto lured the heavy creature onto the frozen ice; managing to dispose of the giant in the icy depths of the lake at nearly the cost of his own life.
When Aleu leaves the crystal and jewel cave and sees day light, a huge mean, and furious Grizzly Bear attempts to kill Aleu. Balto arrives, distracts the bear, saves Aleu, they both escape and the bear disappears.
Bull Moose.
During the events of ', Balto, along with Muk and Luk, descend deep into the territory of the very dangerous and crazed Moose. Despite warnings from Muk and Luk, Balto insisted that they press on in order to rescue the downed bush pilot Duke, as well as Boris. The group encounters one very unintelligent, yet formidable Bull Moose, and only upon the arrival of yet another territorial Moose do they manage to escape from the obsessed duo. The bull moose served as the replacement for the original crazed grizzly bear that appeared in the previous two films.
Both Moose take on a very Italian like personality in heavy reference to the mob genre ("You talkin' to me?"). They are both voiced by experienced voice actor Maurice LaMarche.

Boy's Junior National Tennis Championship

The Boyâs Junior National Tennis Championship takes place on the Kalamazoo College campus in Kalamazoo, Michigan. This event is now one of the most important events for 400 male 16 and 18 year olds who have come from all over the United States.
History.
The United States Tennis Association, or the USTA, is the national governing body in the United States for the sport of tennis. The USTA was originally known as the United States National Lawn Tennis Association in 1881. Later they changed the name to U.S. Lawn Tennis Association, and then finally in 1975 they changed the name to what it is now, the United States Tennis Association. 
The USTA has 17 different sections in all and they are in different parts of the country. The 17 different USTA sections include New England, Eastern, Middle States, Mid-Atlantic, Southern, Florida, Caribbean, Midwest, Northern, Missouri Valley, Texas, Southwest, Intermountain, Pacific Northwest, Northern California, Southern California, Hawaii Pacific. Each of these sections have different regulations and procedures, but they all share the same mission statement. Their mission statement reads, "The USTA is a progressive and diverse not-for-profit organization whose volunteers, professional staff, and financial resources support a single mission: to promote and develop the growth of tennis." 
Each of the sections was started at a different time and they each have their interesting histories. For instance, the USTA Midwest Section or Western Lawn Tennis Association, has a great history that started in 1910. The USTA Midwest was started at the Chicago Beach Club in Chicago, Illinois. It originally controlled all of the tennis clubs west of the Alleghenies Mountains. The USTA Midwest had great influence over the whole USTA at the national meetings. When the USTA Midwest thought that it would be a good idea to have a national clay court championship in 1910, they brought it up to the whole USTA and it passed without dissent. In 1920, the USTA Midwest reconstructed its boundaries and bylaws. The new boundaries included Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In the 1920s tennis became very popular in America and they started to train junior players.
Nationals at the Zoo.
At the first "Nationals at the Zoo", there were only ninety entries for the two age divisions, 18 and under and 16 and under. This event is now one of the most important events for 400 juniors who have come from all over the United States. The event takes place over a ten-day period from which there are winners in singles and doubles tennis. The winners from the 18 and under tournament automatically receive a bid into the main draw of U.S. Open Tournament. 
During the past sixty-five years, many great names in menâs tennis have participated at "Nationals at the Zoo". Past Participants include Rod Laver, Barry MacKay, Stan Smith, Arthur Ashe, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Aaron Krickstein, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier, Pete Sampras, James Blake, Andy Roddick, Bob and Mike Bryan, Ronnie Schneider, Jackson Frons, and many more. All of these big name tennis pros played in the tournament, but only Laver (1956) and Smith (1964) won the boys 18 and under National Championships for singles. The USTA Boys Junior National Championships represents tennis at its finest, whether in the first round or the finals. Attending the tournament is a great way to view future stars.
The nationals have not always been at Kalamazoo College. Originally the tournament was held at West Side Tennis Club in Forrest Hills, New York from 1916â1920 and then again in 1927. Next it moved to Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, Massachusetts from 1921-1923. From 1924-1926 it was at South Side Tennis Club in Chicago, Illinois. Then it was at Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana and it was there from 1928-1942. Due to WWII, it was necessary to move the tournament from a military base. Dr. Allen Stowe influenced the USTA to relocate the tournament to Kalamazoo College. Stowe wanted to bring the tournament to Kalamazoo because of the great city and he was a coach at Kalamazoo College. 
Kalamazoo College is an ideal setting for holding the Nationals. On campus, there is a beautiful architecture and landscaping, as well as great facilities. Home of the National Championships since 1943, Kalamazoo's Stowe Tennis Stadium has eleven well maintained hard courts outside. If there is bad weather, Kalamazoo College has Markin Racquet Center on its campus, which has four indoor courts. Stowe Tennis Stadium has enough seating to hold more than three thousand people. Since Kalamazoo College is within close proximity to Western Michigan University, Western lets them use their 20-court Raymond Sorensen complex for the tournament.
Similar events.
There are many events that are similar to the Junior National Tennis Championship. Girls Championships have a similar event that takes place every year in Berkeley, California for 16- and 18-year-olds. Along with having these great events in the US, there are also events all around the world. In Europe, there are tournaments for boys and girls. These events come in different age groups such as 12, 14, 16 and 18-and-under.

<doc id="20143519" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20143519" title="USS Wandank (ATA-204)">
USS Wandank (ATA-204)

The second USS "Wandank" (ATA-204), originally USS "ATA-204", was a United States Navy auxiliary ocean tug in commission from 1945 to 1947 and again from 1952 to 1971. The ship is possibly best known for supporting scientific operations in the Marianas, in particular serving as communication relay and support ship for the bathyscaphe "Trieste" in Project Nekton; she towed the bathyscaphe some 260 nautical miles (482 kilometers) from Guam to the vicinity of the Challenger Deep, where, on 23 January 1960, "Trieste" descended to a record 37,000 feet (11,278 meters).
Construction and commissioning.
Originally projected as steel-hulled rescue tug USS "ATRâ131", "Wandank" was laid down as USS "ATA-204" on 25 September 1944 at Port Arthur, Texas, by the Gulfport Boiler and Welding Works. She was launched on 9 November 1944 and commissioned on 18 January 1945 with Lieutenant, junior grade, Vernon L. Ryan, USNR, in command. She was 143 ft in length and displaced 835 tons.
First period in commission, 1945-1947.
World War II service, 1945.
Following her shakedown in the Caribbean, "ATA-204" got underway on 23 February 1945 for the Panama Canal, en route World War II service in the Pacific Ocean. She operated with the United States Pacific Fleet through the end of hostilities, performing services at locales ranging from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to the Marshall Islands.
Postwar service and decommissioning, 1945-1947.
After hostilities ended on 15 August 1945, "ATA-204" returned to the United States at San Francisco, California, late in August 1945. She soon shifted to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington. She operated in the 13th Naval District until she was decommissioned on 26 November 1947 and placed in reserve.
Second period in commission, 1952-1971.
Pearl Harbor service, 1952-1955.
The onset of the Korean War (1950-1953) gave "ATA-204" a new lease on life by triggering the expansion of the United States Navy. "ATA-204" was reactivated on 17 April 1952 at Astoria, Oregon, for assignment to the 14th Naval District. Recommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 3 May 1952 with Lieutenant William A. Walden in command, she was renamed USS "Wandank" while retaining her "ATA-204" designation. She operated out of Pearl Harbor until 1955, providing tug and tow services for the Pacific Fleet, and occasionally deployed to American Samoa and other Pacific islands with tows.
Mariana Islands service, 1955-1967.
On 9 September 1955, "Wandank" was transferred to the Mariana Islands. There, she towed barges of supplies, stood ready to assist in search-and-rescue operations, provided target services for gunnery and torpedo exercises, and conducted local surveillance missions out of Guam into the 1960s.
During this deployment, "Wandank" supported scientific operations in addition to her more routine duties. In January 1960, for example, she served as communication relay and support ship for the bathyscaphe "Trieste" in Project Nekton; she towed the bathyscaphe some 260 nautical miles (482 kilometers) from Guam to the vicinity of the Challenger Deep, where, on 23 January 1960, "Trieste" descended to a record 37,000 feet (11,278 meters). Hydrophone gear aboard "Wandank" was still able to communicate with the craft once on the bottom, although the sound waves took seven seconds to make a one-way journey from ship to bathyscaphe, which was nearly seven miles deep.
On occasion, "Wandank"s operations nonetheless assumed a dangerous character during tropical storms. During one of these storms, which occurred late in 1963, "Wandank" was trapped between two typhoons while en route to her annual buoy maintenance duty at Chichi Jima in the Bonin Islands. In the heavy seas, her tow line parted, leaving USS "YCV-18" adrift. During the ensuing recovery operations, the tug's first lieutenant, J. B. Clark, was knocked overboard by a heavy wave and swept from sight.
In November 1964, "Wandank" conducted a survey of the Solomon Islands in a joint project sponsored by the University of Hawaii's Institute of Geophysics and the Office of Naval Research; during the course of this operation, she measured the earth's gravity in the area.
In July 1966, "Wandank" rendezvoused with Japanese merchantman "Yeiji Maru", which had been experiencing engine trouble, and escorted the distressed ship to Guam. Later that year, she towed SS "Old Westbury" to a safe haven, relieving auxiliary ocean tug USS "Sunnadin" (ATA-197), which had run low on fuel on 11 November 1966.
The year 1967 passed with much the same routine.
Vietnam War and Mariana Islands service, 1968-1971.
In 1968, "Wandank" participated in her first operations in connection with the Vietnam War. She towed gasoline barge USS "YOG-131" from Guam to Danang, South Vietnam, from 3 January 1968 to 15 January 1968. After returning from Vietnamese waters, she performed island survey duties in the western Caroline Islands and subsequently helped to search for floating drydock USS "AFDM-6", which had broken loose from her civilian tow vessel. "Wandank" next participated in special operations into the summer of 1968 before making a second voyage to Vietnamese waters, towing USS "APL-30" to Vung Tau, South Vietnam, from 16 August 1968 to 1 September 1968.
"Wandank" commenced 1969 with more island surveillance missions in the central Caroline Islands, sending a landing party ashore from her crew to ascertain the needs of the islanders who lived under the care and protection of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. She conducted a training mission to Yokosuka, Japan, in February and March 1969 before returning to a schedule of surveillance operations in the northern Mariana Islands. She trained for possible participation in Project Apollo in April 1969 before she towed three barges from Sattahip, Thailand, to Vung Tau, South Vietnam, from 13 April 1969 to 8 May 1969.
Upon returning to the vicinity of the Mariana and Caroline Islands soon thereafter, she conducted local operations through the end of 1969. Wandank interrupted this duty only long enough to tow landing craft utility USS "LCU-1483" to Ponape Island and USS "LCU-1497" to Majuro, from 25 November 1969 to 4 December 1969.
During her final full year of naval service, 1970, "Wandank" conducted local operations out of her home port of Apra Harbor, Guam.
She got underway from Guam on 20 January 1971 for Hong Kong and then escorted three "Asheville"-class patrol gunboats to Subic Bay, the Philippines, and Camranh Bay. South Vietnam, serving as a communication back-up vessel. She later escorted two gunboats from Camranh Bay to Hong Kong before returning to island surveillance duties.
Final decommissioning and disposal.
Decommissioned at Guam on 1 July 1971, "Wandank" was simultaneously turned over to the Department of the Interior for service in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Returned to the Navy on 22 May 1973, "Wandank" was adjudged unfit for further Navy service and accordingly struck from the Navy List on 1 August 1973. Subsequently returned to the Department of the Interior as her original designation number ATR-131, she resumed service in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands on island surveillance and local towing duties.
She was finally sunk as a target ship in 1979.
Honors and awards.
"Wandank" was awarded three battle stars for her Vietnam War service.

Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary

On 14 May 1988 the Atlantic Records label held its 40th Anniversary Celebration by staging a non-stop concert lasting almost 13 hours at Madison Square Garden, New York. The event was dubbed "It's Only Rock And Roll".
Only artists who had released material on the Atlantic label in the United States performed, with the artists spanning the 40 years of the company's existence. Lavern Baker and Ruth Brown were the longest tenured Atlantic acts to perform, while Debbie Gibson was the most recent Atlantic signing to make an appearance at the event.
Some Atlantic signings, who had either officially split up or who had not performed together for a number of years, re-formed especially to perform at the concert. These artists included The Rascals, Iron Butterfly, and the former members of Led Zeppelin. Other notable performers included Yes, Genesis, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer (representing Emerson, Lake & Palmer), Foreigner, Paul Rodgers, Bob Geldof, Booker T. Jones, Wilson Pickett, The Coasters, The Spinners, Peabo Bryson, The Blues Brothers (featuring Dan Aykroyd and Sam Moore), Roberta Flack, The Manhattan Transfer, Bee Gees, Ben E. King and Vanilla Fudge.
There had been plans to close the performance with a greatest hits all-star jam, but this idea was shelved. Instead, the former members of Led Zeppelin performed as the last act.
The concert was broadcast live in the USA on FM radio and HBO television, commentary for the latter being provided backstage by comedian Robert Townsend. HBO commenced its live broadcast a few hours into the event and interspersed footage of the concert which had been taped earlier by the network. In so doing, some of the artists' sets were edited or omitted. An edited version aired later that year on ABC hosted by Robert Hays. Several banners heralding the reunion of Led Zeppelin band members were displayed like tapestry by excited fans, but, to their dismay, were taken down before HBO went with their live feed.
In the United Kingdom the event was broadcast over a period of four weeks by BBC 2, presented as hour-long episodes. Atlantic Records later released this production on video under the title "Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary: It's Only Rock 'n' Roll". The release intercut concert footage with highlights from earlier performances, as well as older footage from the Atlantic archives.

Potamo of Alexandria

Potamo (or Potamon, ) of Alexandria was an eclectic philosopher who lived in the Roman era. According to Diogenes LaÃ«rtius, Potamo had "not long ago" created an eclectic sect of philosophy, which would mean that he lived sometime around the 2nd century CE. However, the Suda says that Potamo lived in the age of Augustus (late 1st century BC) which, if true, would mean that LaÃ«rtius probably copied a statement, without alteration, from an earlier writer. 
According to LaÃ«rtius he combined doctrines derived from the various philosophy schools (Platonism, Peripateticism, Stoicism, etc.) together with original views of his own. According to the Suda he wrote a commentary on the "Republic" of Plato. Diogenes LaÃ«rtius provides us with some details concerning his philosophical views:
He himself states in his "Elements of Philosophy", he takes as criteria of truth (1) that by which the judgement is formed, namely, the ruling principle of the soul; (2) the instrument used, for instance the most accurate perception. His universal principles are matter and the efficient cause, quality, and place; for that out of which and that by which a thing is made, as well as the quality with which and the place in which it is made, are principles. The end to which he refers all actions is life made perfect in all virtue, natural advantages of body and environment being indispensable to its attainment.
There is no reason to associate him with the Potamo mentioned by Porphyry in his "Life of Plotinus".

<doc id="20143592" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20143592" title="Udo SchÃ¼tz">
Udo SchÃ¼tz

Udo SchÃ¼tz (born January 1937) is a German entrepreneur, who was competing successfully with racing cars in the 1960s, and with yachts in the 1990s.
His career began in the early 1960s. With Anton Fischhaber and his #72 Porsche 904 he in 1965 won the GT 2.0 class at the 1000 km NÃ¼rburgring, finishing 11th overall, and soon was hired by the factory to represent Porsche in motorsport.
The 1967 World Sportscar Championship season began with two DNF in the USA, followed by an 8th at Monza, and he did not even start at Spa with his Porsche 906 being entered by a Portuguese team while other factory drivers already had the improved Porsche 910. Rather heavy and tall, dubbed the âBull from Seltersâ (his home town), SchÃ¼tz was not well suited for the low race cars, especially when fitted with closed tops. For other tall drivers like Dan Gurney and Mike Parkes, special bubble roof extensions were added to Ford and Ferrari cars. Driving around Sicily for the 1967 Targa in regular traffic, with the street-legal 910 #184 and without a helmet, SchÃ¼tz' head did not fit behind the wind screen. Paired with former Targa winner Umberto Maglioli, SchÃ¼tz suffered yet another DNF, but two weeks later in Germany, SchÃ¼tz won the 1000Â km NÃ¼rburgring outright in 1967, paired with Joe Buzzetta on the #17 Porsche 910. Le Mans was yet another DNF, followed by his second world championship win, paired with Gerhard Mitter in a 910 at Mugello, then a Targa-like road race in Italy with eight laps of 66Â km each. In Brands Hatch, he shared a 910 with Jochen Rindt, finishing 11th. Zeltweg was another DNF, in a 906 entered by Scuderia Lufthansa, and the penultimate round in Switzerland, the Hill Climb at Ollon-Villars, saw him finishing with a tiny Fiat-Abarth 1000cc at the lower end of the field.
For the 1968 World Sportscar Championship season, SchÃ¼tz joined the Italian Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 factory team, scoring 5th place at the 24 Hours of Daytona, with the rest of the season being rather disappointing.
SchÃ¼tz returned to Porsche for the 1969 World Sportscar Championship season and was paired there with Gerhard Mitter, mostly on a Porsche 908/02, fitted with spyder or long tail body. The season began at Daytona with a 24th place following camshaft trouble, and a 5th place at Sebring. In the third round at Brands Hatch they scored their first podium finish, beaten by two sister cars. The first Italian race, the 1000km Monza, ended with an engine failure, but the second one, in Sicily, with a triumph. They won the Targa Florio on the Porsche 908/2 #266 ahead of three sister cars. For the 1969 1000km Spa, a fast track like Monza and Le Mans, they opted to drive the powerful new Porsche 917 for the first time ever in a race, even though they had qualified it only at 8th, slower than their 908. The flat-12-cylinder engine failed in lap 1 before SchÃ¼tz could take over from Mitter. At the Ring, Mitter/SchÃ¼tz qualified 3rd in their 908/02, but due to suspension problems ended up 31st while the other 908s occupied the first five places. At the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans, Mitter and SchÃ¼tz were back in the 908. After 14 hours, in lap 199, SchÃ¼tz at high speed crashed his #23 Langheck badly after a collision with the #64 sister car driven by GÃ©rard Larrousse, getting ejected from the car when it rolled, surviving without severe injuries. Having already secured the championship, the "Porsche System Engineering" factory team did not participate in the penultimate round at Watkins Glen in mid July. Only three 908/02 cars were shipped overseas and entered by other teams, and SchÃ¼tz was not among the drivers.
After his driving partner Gerhard Mitter died two weeks later in practice for the 1969 German Grand Prix, SchÃ¼tz skipped the ultimate round in Zeltweg and retired, sticking to his decision even when Ferrari looked for experienced drivers for their Ferrari 512S multi-car effort in 1970. In total he won 50 races, three of them counting towards the world championship. He has won the German Sports car championship in 1966, scored 2nd with and for Porsche in the 1967 World Sportscar Championship season, finished 3rd with Alfa in 1968, and helped Porsche to finally secure the World Sportscar Championship in 1969.
He focused on his company SchÃ¼tz Werke in his home town of Selters (Westerwald), which offers also containers. Thus, âContainerâ was the name of his yacht with which he in 1993, together with Pinta and "Rubin XII", won the Admiral's Cup for Germany. In 2008, SchÃ¼tz had a new âContainerâ built, with modern materials.

Ida Bagus Made Togog

Ida Bagus Made Togog (1913â1989) was born into a noble Brahmana clan in the center of Batuan. Together with I Ngendon, he was one of the foremost painters from Batuan. Unlike Ngendon, Togog was not particularly interested in Western ideas. He was comfortable with the Balinese way of life and adhered closely to the Balinese belief system. As a member of the high priest family, Togog was very familiar with Balinese lontar (religious literature) and Balinese myths and folklore. His works were primarily drawn from religion and local myths from an insider's view point and he narrates them through his drawings, just like in the Wayang tradition. The strength of his drawings was neither his draftsmanship nor composition, but his narration of complex religious beliefs and the united life in Bali as a balance between the macrocosm and microcosm, between the benevolent and good spirits.
According to Wim Bakker, it was the Dutch painter Rudolf Bonnet, who inspired him to translate images in Balinese lontars into drawings.
During 1936 to 1938, he was befriended by Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead and produced 83 paintings for them. As Bateson and Mead went to Bali to do research on Balinese character, they requested Togog to give an expression of his dreams. He produced a large number of drawings on dreams and his own interpretation in the context of Balinese beliefs as he understood it.
His works can be found in Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam and in the Rudolf Bonnet collection at the Ethnography Museum in Leiden, the Netherlands. In Bali, his can be viewed at the Puri Lukisan Museum and the Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA) in Ubud, Bali.

The Solvay Hut (German: "SolvayhÃ¼tte") is a mountain hut located on the north-eastern ridge (HÃ¶rnli Ridge) of the Matterhorn, near Zermatt in the canton of Valais. At it is the highest mountain hut owned by the Swiss Alpine Club, but can be used only in case of emergency. The HÃ¶rnli Hut lying on the same ridge is the starting point of the normal route to the summit.
The Solvay Hut was built in 1915, 50 years after the first ascent of the Matterhorn which took place on the same ridge. It offers 10 beds and is equipped with a radiotelephone. The hut was named after his founder Ernest Solvay, a Belgian chemist and industrialist.

James Walker (Australian politician)

James Thomas Walker (20 March 1841 â 18 January 1923) was a Scottish-born Australian banker and politician.
Walker was born in Scotland but spent his early childhood in New South Wales, before returning to Scotland with his family to study finance. Joining the Bank of New South Wales, he returned to Australia and held various financial positions in New South Wales and Queensland. Gaining a public reputation for financial expertise, he was active in the Federationist cause and was a delegate to the 1897 Constitutional Convention, where he was a significant figure in the development of Commonwealth finance schemes. After assisting the successful "Yes" campaign for the 1898 referendum, he was elected to the Senate in 1901 as a Free Trader.
As a senator, Walker continued to focus on finance, although his views on social policy sometimes saw him on the outside of his party. He supported the White Australia policy but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader in opposition to the dictation test, by which a potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.
Early life and career.
Walker was born on Leith Walk in Edinburgh to grazier John William Walker and his wife Elizabeth, "nÃ©e" Waterston. The family migrated to New South Wales in 1844 and settled on Castlereads Station near Boorowa. In 1849, John Walker sold the property to Hamilton Hume and returned to Scotland. James was educated at the Edinburgh Institution and King's College London before returning to Edinburgh in 1857. After several years in Scotland working first for the paper manufacturers Cowan & Sons, and then for stockbroker Robert Allan, he joined the Bank of New South Wales' London branch in March 1860; his cousin, Thomas Walker, was one of the bank's directors. In January 1862 he departed for Melbourne on "Swiftsure" and was posted to the bank's Sydney office.
Walker was then sent by the bank to Rockhampton in Queensland, where he worked as an accountant until 1866 when he was appointed manager of the Townsville branch. In 1867 he was transferred to the Toowoomba branch, which he managed until 1878 when he was promoted assistant inspector in Brisbane. He married Janette Isabella Palmer on 16 April 1868 at Range View. In 1885 he resigned from the Bank of New South Wales to become the first manager of the Royal Bank of Queensland, but in 1887 he returned to New South Wales to manage the estate of Eadith Walker, the daughter of his late cousin Thomas.
Federation.
Walker had a strong interest in Federation and was a member of the Australasian Federation League of New South Wales. In 1896 he attended the People's Federal Convention in Bathurst, where he proposed a financial scheme that would provide savings for a federal government based on income from state taxes and federal spending. His reputation for financial expertise saw him elected to the Australian Federal Convention in 1897. There he supported equal representation for all states in an upper house, Commonwealth control of railways, and a national capital on federal territory. He reiterated his financial proposals, but was overlooked for the finance and trade committee, having been described by Alfred Deakin as "a mere commercial man".
Despite this setback, Walker continued to play an active part in the development of the Australian Constitution. He had the name of the federal upper house changed from the "States Assembly" to the Senate, although his proposal that the federated colonies adopt the name "Commonwealth of Australasia", with a view to the future inclusion of New Guinea, New Zealand and Fiji, was not adopted. He also supported a minimum age for senators of twenty-five, rather than twenty-one, and voted for Paddy Glynn's proposal to include recognition of a "Divine Sovereign" in the Constitution.
The second session of the Convention took place in Sydney in September 1897. Walker was appointed to a subcommittee on federal finance, which proposed a financial scheme based on Walker's Bathurst proposal that was adopted by the Convention. He was active in the Federation referendum campaign, travelling around New South Wales to encourage a "Yes" vote. He mostly focused on financial issues, and in 1899 went to Western Australia, the most reluctant colony, to increase support.
Following the success of the referendum, Walker was encouraged to stand for the Senate by a petition of over 6500 signatures. A staunch free trader, Walker campaigned as part of the Free Trade Party's endorsed ticket. He had resigned as president of the Bank of New South Wales in 1897, but remained a director. At the first federal election in March 1901, Walker was elected as a New South Wales Senator at the head of the poll.
Senate career.
As a senator, Walker devoted his support to a variety of causes, including a transcontinental railway and equal pay for women. He opposed a federal old-age pension scheme on the grounds of lack of funds, and also opposed the Immigration Restriction Bill, although he supported the White Australia policy in principle. He opposed the proposed form of the dictation test and supported James Macfarlane's amendment requiring the test to be administered in a language known to the immigrant, moving his own amendment after Macfarlane's was defeated. He also expressed reservations about the deportation of Kanaka labourers, supporting the reduction in their use but advocating that those resident in Australia for at least five years be permitted to remain. He vigorously opposed compulsory arbitration, and voted against the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.
Re-elected as an Anti-Socialist in 1906, Walker expressed the view that the three-party system of the Australian Parliament's first decade was dysfunctional, and implored electors to vote "for either socialism or anti-socialism, and so end this triangular government". He continued to support the transcontinental railway and lamented the slow progress of the decision on a site for the federal capital, and supported a higher rate of immigration and the watering down of the Immigration Restriction Act. In 1908, he introduced the Commonwealth Companies Reserve Liabilities Bill, which permitted special reserve funds for banks to assist shareholders during a financial crisis, and in 1910 followed with the similar Commonwealth Banking Companies Reserve Liabilities Bill. He complained of the difficulty of passing private senators' bills, and at the 1913 election he retired, suffering from ill health.
Later life.
Walker maintained an interest in politics after his retirement, and remained a director of the Bank of New South Wales until 1921. He had been president of the Australian Golf Club (1903â19), a director of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, and a member of the Presbyterian Church's finance committee. A fellow of the Institute of Bankers in London since 1886 and vice-president of the Australian Economic Association, he also continued as a director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society and a councillor of St Andrew's College at the University of Sydney. Walker died on 18 January 1923 at Woollahra in Sydney, and was survived by his wife and five of their seven children. Buried at South Head Cemetery, his estate at his death was worth Â£27,697.

Simon Kimber

Simon Julian Spencer Kimber (born 6 October 1963) is a former English cricketer who played first-class and List A cricket in the 1980s and 1990s.
After a number of appearances in the Worcestershire second team, he made his first-class debut against Oxford University at The University Parks in May 1985; in a game perhaps more notable for Richard Illingworth's match figures of 13-59 (including 6-9 in the first innings), Kimber scored 14 not out at number ten in his only innings, bowled seven wicketless overs and held one catch.
Kimber also appeared against Cambridge University, taking his first three first-class wickets,
but that was to be his only other first-team outing for Worcestershire.
Kimber's English appearances in 1986 were confined to a handful of Second XI games with Derbyshire, but that winter he went to South Africa and played a couple of first-class matches for Natal B in the Castle Bowl, claiming six wickets in the match against Eastern Province B.
For 1987 he joined Sussex, with whom he was to remain until 1989. It was during this period that he produced his only first-class half-century: 54 against Nottinghamshire in early August 1987.
In the 1987 season he appeared eight times in first-class cricket, his most in a single season, but the only time he was anything like a regular was in the one-day form of the game the following summer, when he made 20 List A appearances. However, in those games he took only 14 wickets and failed entirely with the bat, compiling just 81 runs in his 11 innings.
The rest of Kimber's cricketing career was spent in South Africa, again playing for Natal B and â in 1990-91 â the province's main team. He proved a considerably more successful wicket-taker here than he had been in England, claiming four or more wickets in a first-class innings on five occasions and in January 1992 achieving his only five-wicket innings haul when he took 5-63 for Natal B against Transvaal B.
He played his final match in December 1993.

Rock Canyon High School

Rock Canyon High School is a public high school in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. It is part of Douglas County School District RE-1.
The school is adjacent to Rocky Heights Middle School, and serves students in Highlands Ranch, Castle Pines North, Castle Pines Village, and Castle Rock.
The school has a reputation for academics, offering numerous AP Classes, and being consistently ranked "Excellent" by Colorado School Accountability Reports.
History.
Rock Canyon High School became a member of the Douglas County School District RE-1 (Douglas County, Colorado) for the 2003â2004 school year. The school's first year opened with just a freshman class, a common practice for opening high schools. Rock Canyon's case was unique, however, as the construction on the school was not yet complete, forcing the freshman class to spend their first year in a wing of nearby Rocky Heights Middle School.
In April 2011, Principal Kim Rauh announced that she had accepted an administrative position at Cherokee Trail High School, to be closer to her family. Assistant Principal Greg Doan also announced his departure to be principal at Eagle Valley High School in Eagle, Colorado. Rauh had been with the school since 2007 as principal. Doan had been with the school since its inception, originally as a social studies teacher.
In May 2011, the new principal was announced to be Andy Abner, an administrator from nearby Douglas County High School. Abner assumed administrative duties in June 2011.
Rock Canyon was listed 403rd on Newsweek's list of America's Best High Schools in June 2011.

Old Bahama Channel

The Old Bahama Channel is a strait off the northern coast of Cuba and the Sabana-CamagÃ¼ey Archipelago and south of the Great Bahama Bank. It is approximately long and wide.
It divides the northernmost bank of the West Indies into two nearly equal parts. To the north and northeast is the Great Bahama Bank and the Bahama Islands; and to the south the bank on which the island of Cuba rests. The Old Bahama Channel is connected at its north-western extremity end to the Florida Straits by two arms, enclosing Cay Sal Bank, of which the northern is called Santaren Channel and the southern Nicholas Channel. It is considered as terminating on the east between Cape Maysi in Cuba, and the Bahamas island of Inagua. However, it can also be considered to include the deep sea which separates the minor banks north of Haiti from this island, so that it extends to the Mona Passage, or the strait between the islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. The narrowest portion of the Old Bahama Channel is between 22Â° and 23Â° North latitude, where its width rarely exceeds twelve miles.
The Spanish colonial trade routes, which originally favored the Old Bahama Channel, shifted to the Straits of Florida (the New Bahama Channel) as it was a safer alternative. In the Old Bahama Channel, ship captains had to pick their way through the low lying cays and shoals of the southern Bahamas.

Air data boom

An air data boom provides air pressure, temperature, and airflow direction data to data acquisition and air data computers for the computation of aircraft orientation, airspeed, altitude, and related information. Depending on the nature of the activity, air data booms can be used a primary flight instruments or as a "measurement standard" of which primary flight instruments are compared to.
Purpose and Overview.
An air data boom is used to collect source data during the flight testing of aircraft. The air data boom is mounted on the aircraft in a location that allows for relatively undisturbed air to be measured. To attain such undisturbed air, mounting is usually done on the nose, wing, or upper horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft.
Typical Components.
Air data booms may contain one, some, or all of these measuring capabilities:
Specialized air data booms may also contain mission-specific sensors such humidity sensors, ice detectors, accelerometers, strain gages, and the like.
Synonyms.
Air data booms are referred to by a variety names to include:
Supply Sources.
Most air data booms are procured from niche manufacturers or designed and built in-house by aircraft manufacturers and flight test organizations.

Wilhelm Bousset

Wilhelm Bousset (September 3, 1865, LÃ¼beck â March 8, 1920, GieÃen) was a German theologian and New Testament scholar. He was of Huguenot ancestry and a native of LÃ¼beck.
He began his studies at the University of Erlangen, where he met Ernst Troeltsch (1865â1923), with whom he would maintain a friendship that would last throughout his career. Later he studied at Leipzig, where he was student of Adolf von Harnack (1851â1930), and afterwards continued his studies at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. In 1890 he became a professor of New Testament exegesis at GÃ¶ttingen, later relocating to the University of Giessen (1916).
Bousset was a prominent figure in the "Religionsgeschichtliche Schule" (history of religions school), a group that included scholars such as Richard August Reitzenstein (1861â1931), Albert Eichhorn (1856â1926) and Hermann Gunkel (1862â1932). His better known work involved comparative studies between the Early Christian Church and other religious beliefs, particularly Hellenistic Judaism. Bousset demonstrated in his writings that Christian thought was profoundly influenced by neighboring cultures and belief systems.
Written works.
Bousset was a prolific writer, and among his books that were translated into English were "Kyrios Christos: Geschichte des Christusglaubens von den AnfÃ¤ngen des Christentums bis IrenÃ¤us" (Kyrios Christos; A History of the Belief in Christ from the Beginnings of Christianity to Irenaeus), and "Der Antichrist in Der Uberlieferung Des Judentums, Des Neuen Testaments Und Der Alten Kirche" (Antichrist Legend: A Chapter in Christian and Jewish Folklore). Other noted works by Bousset include:

Albert Gould

Sir Albert John Gould (12 February 1847 â 27 July 1936) was an Australian politician and solicitor who served as the second President of the Australian Senate.
A solicitor, businessman and citizen soldier before his entry into politics, Gould was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1882 to 1898, during which time he served as Minister for Justice in two Free Trade governments. He later served two years in the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1899 to 1901 until his election to the Australian Senate. Gould's interest in parliamentary procedure saw him become involved with the relevant standing committee and he was elected unopposed as the second President of the Senate in 1907. His tenure is remembered as more traditionalist and Anglophilic than his predecessor's.
Defeated by the Labor nominee in 1910 following the Liberal government's defeat, Gould remained in parliament as a backbencher until 1917, when he retired after he was not re-endorsed by the Nationalist Party. He was active in community and religious affairs during his long retirement.
Early life and career.
Gould was born in Sydney, the son of solicitor John Morton Gould and his wife Anne ("nÃ©e" Livingstone). He attended William Woolls' school in Parramatta, and went on to study law at the University of Sydney, although he did not take a degree. He served his articles with his father and was admitted to the bar in December 1870. He then worked in Singleton for a Sydney legal firm. Gould also developed significant business interests, being involved with the Great Cobar Copper Mining syndicate and serving as a director of the Electric Light and Power Supply Company, the City Bank of Sydney and the Oriental Timber Corporation. On 12 September 1872, he married Jeanette Jessie Maitland at St Paul's Church of England in West Maitland.
Gould was also a citizen soldier, enlisting as a volunteer in the West Maitland company of the New South Wales volunteer forces. He later took command of the Singleton Company, becoming a major in 1886. He later received the Volunteer Officers' Decoration for long service; he would retire from the regiment in 1902 as a lieutenant-colonel.
State politics.
In 1882, Gould was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Patrick's Plains (renamed Singleton in 1894). Initially an opponent of the coalition associated with Henry Parkes and John Robertson, he later supported Robertson's government in 1885. By 1887 he was supporting his career with his own legal practice in Singleton and Sydney, and when the party system came into being in New South Wales in that year he identified as a Free Trader. In 1889 he was appointed Minister for Justice under Parkes, serving until 1891; he held the position again under George Reid from 1894 to 1898. During the first period of his ministry he became involved in a dispute with the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Darley, over requests for improved court accommodation and a contested punishment for contempt of two witnesses. Despite embarrassing his premier, he remained close with Parkes throughout his state career and in later years frequently gave speeches in his memory.
Gould's career as justice minister was marked by consolidation of the law, tightening of licensing laws and reforms relating to police courts. A supporter of Federation, he nevertheless opposed the 1898 bill, which he believed deprived New South Wales of adequate recognition. He was defeated in the election of that year, but in 1899 he was one of Premier Reid's twelve appointments to the Legislative Council that enabled the passage of the legislation for a referendum on Federation.
Senate career.
Following Federation, Gould contested the first federal election in March 1901, standing for the Senate as a Free Trader. He was elected in the third of six positions, entitling him to a six-year term. His first speech was largely devoted to his impassioned support for free trade, and in his early years as a senator he also supported decentralisation and opposed proposals to establish a federal capital. A supporter of the White Australia policy, he expressed concern over Kanaka labour in Queensland, although his assumption that the arrangement was temporary enabled his pragmatism on this issue. Gould was also involved in defence matters, supporting the introduction of conscription and maintaining loyalty to the Empire, where "there are men much more experienced in the principles of government than we are". At the 1906 election, Gould was easily re-elected in the first position, winning the largest vote for any senator to that time.
From 1901 Gould maintained an interest in the procedure of the Senate, and was a member of the standing orders committee from its appointment in 1901 until 1907. He had supported the opening of Senate proceedings with prayer and had made frequent reference to the standing orders of the British House of Commons. He contested the Presidency of the Senate in 1904, but was defeated by the incumbent, Sir Richard Baker.
On Baker's retirement, Gould was unanimously elected President on 20 February 1907. He endeavoured to keep the Senate representative of the states' interests and free from party politics, and his rulings focused on unparliamentary language and relevance. Gould, appointed Knight Bachelor in 1908, differed from his predecessor in his adherence to British influence. With the election of the Fisher Labor Government in 1910, Gould was defeated by Harry Turley for the presidency.
Despite his support for conscription, Gould was not endorsed by the new Nationalist Party to contest the 1917 election. Deeply offended, Gould nevertheless elected to retire rather than run as an independent and split the Nationalist vote.
Later life.
In his retirement, Gould continued his community involvement. A director of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, he also served as a member and chancellor of the Sydney and Newcastle synods of the Church of England. He died in July 1936 at Rose Bay aged 89; he was survived by two sons and three daughters (his wife died in 1928; one daughter had also predeceased him). Gould was given a state funeral at St Andrew's Cathedral and was buried at South Head Cemetery.

Telford Medal

The Telford Gold Medal is the highest prize awarded by the British Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) for a paper, or series of papers; it was introduced in 1835 following a bequest made by Thomas Telford, the ICE's first president.
History.
In 1834 Scottish civil engineer and the Institution of Civil Engineers' first President (1820-1834), Thomas Telford died, leaving in his will his library of technical works to the Institution of Civil Engineers, as well as a bequest of Â£2000; the interest from which was to be used to for the purpose of "Annual Premiums". The council of the institute decided to expend the premiums on both honorary and monetary rewards, the honorary awards being named "Telford Medals", which would be awarded in gold, silver and bronze forms. Suitable candidates for the awards were submitters of drawings, models, diagrams or essays relating to civil engineering or any other new equipment of invention relating to engineering or surveying in general, whiich is regarded as most seminal and influential. The awards were to be open to both Englishmen and foreigners equally. After provision for the Telford Medal, the remaining income is used for up to four annual prizes for papers presented to the Institution.
The inaugural gold award was given in June 1837 to John Timperley for his account of the history and construction of the town docks of the Port of Kingston upon Hull, published in volume 1 of the Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers; the medals carried an image of Telford on one side, and of his Menai Bridge on the reverse. John Macneill, James M. Rendel, Michael A. Borthwick, Peter Barlow, and Benedetto Albano received silver awards in the same session.

Isabella of Portugal, Lady of Viseu

Isabella of Portugal (1364â1395) was the natural daughter of King Ferdinand I of Portugal, from unknown mother.
Biography.
Before 1386 she was betrothed to JoÃ£o Afonso Telo de Menezes, 1st Count of Viana (do Alentejo), son of the powerful "Dom" JoÃ£o Afonso Telo de Menezes, 4th Count of Barcelos. However, this project was abandoned or dissolved.
She married Alfonso, Count of GijÃ³n and NoroÃ±a, natural son of King Henry II of Castile. Her marriage was one of the clauses of the peace treaty, signed in 1373, between Portugal and Castile.
Through a royal letter issued on October 2, 1377, her father granted her the Lordship of Viseu, Celorico, Linhares and Algodres.
She left to the Royal Court of King Henry II of Castile where she lived while waiting for an appropriate age to get married, once her groom was, then, only 9 years old. They finally married in 1378 in the city of Burgos. From this marriage was issued the Noronha family, still represented in several aristocratic houses, both in Portugal and in Spain.
The couple had 7 children:
Due to her husband's conflict with his brother, King John I of Castile, Alfonso, Count of GijÃ³n and NoroÃ±a was arrested and died during a fight. Isabella returned to her native Portugal where her uncle, King John I of Portugal, gave her a warm welcome and protection, both to her and to her children.
Once Alfonso was Count of NoreÃ±a, an Asturian village he had received from his father, Isabel's children used the Portuguese spelling Noronha as their family name.

Mike Davis (boat builder)

Mike Davis (December 6, 1939 â November 3, 2008) was a boat builder who was a hands-on advocate for making recreational boat usage available on the Hudson River from New York City and New Jersey.
Michael Kincaid Davis was born in Baltimore on December 6, 1939. He was one of three children. While his father was a captain in the United States Coast Guard, it was his experience as an anthropologist and archeologist that triggered his nautical interests. He graduated from Beloit College in 1964 and was awarded a master's degree at the University of Oklahoma in anthropology. He worked with archeological teams from the University of Chicago, and spent several years working on an archeological dig in Turkey at DiyarbakÄ±r, near the Euphrates River. The dig was interrupted by guerrilla activity. After spending time in Istanbul and seeing how individuals could easily rent a boat and take it out rowing on the Bosporus, he came to the conclusion that the same thing should be available on the Hudson River. Davis noted that "as late as 1933 there were 41 boathouses in Manhattan, while now there is just one."
After reading articles in boating journals, Davis created an organization called Floating the Apple in March 1994 to help provide boating opportunities on the Hudson River. With financial assistance from the Open Space Institute, Davis decided that the group should build boats and make them available for public use. A design was developed for a boat that could accommodate ten passengers, and the boats were constructed using donated tools in space made available to Davis by the 42d Street Development Corporation. The boats that Davis constructed were Whitehall gigs, a longer version of the traditional Whitehall Rowboat that dates back to a 250-year-old design that was the type of boat George Washington used to get his troops across the East River during the Battle of Long Island.
, Floating the Apple was located at Pier 84 in Hudson River Park. Other spinoff groups were located at Pier 40, on East 96th Street, in the South Bronx, in Weehawken, New Jersey and at five other locations north of New York City.
Davis was a resident of Manhattan and died at age 68 on November 3, 2008. The cause of death was not immediately determined.

Gorse in New Zealand

__NOTOC__
Gorse ("Ulex europaeus") is a major invasive plant species in New Zealand and millions of dollars are spent on its control.
Gorse is one of the most widely recognised agricultural weeds in New Zealand. It covers at varying densities â a total of 5% of the land area of New Zealand when excluding existing indigenous forest, vegetated sub-alpine and alpine areas. 
Introduced from Western Europe in the very early stages of European settlement, it was recorded by Charles Darwin during his voyage through New Zealand waters in 1835 as growing in hedges in the Bay of Islands. Its spread and development as a weed in New Zealand's temperate climate was rapid, but settlers failed to recognise the threat; gorse seed continued to be imported and plantings deliberately established into the 1900s. The seed can lie dormant on the ground for up to 50 years, germinating quickly after the adults have been removed. Unfortunately, most methods of removing adult gorse plants, such as burning or bulldozing them, create the ideal conditions for the gorse seeds to germinate.
Large spreading infestations over hundreds of hectares resulted, peaking in the late 1940s. Gorse became New Zealand's most costly weed to control and total eradication with current technology seems impossible. 
Gorse has been found to form a useful nursery for many species for native bush regeneration. When young, gorse bushes are very dense. As they grow older, they become 'leggy', and provide the ideal conditions for native seeds to germinate and grow. The native seedlings grow up through the gorse, cutting out its light and eventually replacing it. This technique is working successfully and within a short time frame at Hinewai Reserve on Banks Peninsula.
Gorse has been used for hedges and windbreaks on the Canterbury Plains since the 1850s. These windbreaks have a combined length of 300,000 kilometres. 
Biological control.
Biological control of gorse has been investigated since the 1920s. Seven different agents have been released in New Zealand. Results have been mixed, but in general neither the seed-feeding nor foliage-feeding insects are doing enough damage to be viable as a stand-alone control agent.

John Neild

John Cash Neild (4 January 1846 â 8 March 1911) was an English-born Australian politician who served as a Senator from New South Wales from 1901 to 1910.
Neild's family arrived in Australia in 1860, and he worked as an insurance agent and company manager before winning election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1885. He served intermittently until 1901 and had a tumultuous career as a backbencher, eventually contributing significantly to the fall of the Reid government in 1899. He also established his own volunteer regiment, which had a difficult and sometimes hostile relationship with military command.
Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a vigorous supporter of old-age pensions, free trade and several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy and spoke in support of the children of Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in contempt of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.
Early life.
Neild was born in Bristol on 4 January 1846 to Maria Greenwood and John Cash Neild, a surgeon. He was named after his father. In 1853 the family moved to Taranaki in New Zealand, evacuating to Sydney in 1860 to escape the First Taranaki War. On 29 October 1868 Neild married Clara Matilda Gertrude Agnew, whose father Philip founded the New South Wales Free Church of England. Clara died in 1879, three years after the death of the only child of the marriage; Neild remarried on 19 February 1880 at St Paul's Anglican Church in Redfern, to Georgine Marie Louise Uhr, daughter of a former New South Wales sheriff.
Neild had received a private education and was first employed at Montefiore, Joseph & Co., an importing firm. In 1865 he set up as a commission agent, becoming an insurance agent by 1870 and later managing several companies. He was elected to Woollahra Municipal Council in 1876 and in 1882 unsuccessfully stood for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Paddington. He was successful at his second attempt in 1885, when he was elected as a supporter of Henry Parkes; remaining on Woollahra Council, he served as mayor from 1888 to 1889, leaving the council in 1890.
State politics and military career.
Neild devoted his first speech to criticism of the Protectionist Dibbs government, and became known for pursuing causes such as free trade, old-age pensions and law reform. He earned the nickname "Jawbone" on 23 June 1886, after speaking for nine hours against the Jennings government's introduction of "ad valorem" duties. He was narrowly passed over by Parkes for a ministry in January 1887, but was given charge of Sir Alfred Stephen's divorce extension bill, which passed in 1892. Neild continued to be active in religious affairs, serving from 1891 to 1893 as Right Worshipful Grand Master of the Loyal Orange Institution of New South Wales, although he offended many extreme Protestants by praying for the recovery of the Pope.
Neild began to encounter difficulties in his political career towards the end of the 1880s; in 1887, his oversight of the erection of the Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition led to investigation by a Legislative Assembly select committee, which absolved him of accusations of extravagance and using his office for personal gain. In 1895 he began to agitate for old-age pensions, but in 1899 he was investigated again after Premier George Reid paid him Â£350 for writing a report; although Neild repaid the money, the incident was part of the pretext for a successful no confidence motion in September which brought down the Reid government. Neild also published an anthology of his own poetry, "Songs 'neath the Southern Cross", in 1896.
In 1896, in response to the establishment of an Irish-Australian unit in the New South Wales citizen army, Neild raised a volunteer regiment that became St George's English Rifles. He was promoted major of the regiment in July 1896 and lieutenant-colonel in April 1898, and frequently led his men, dressed as British soldiers, around Circular Quay to the tune of "The British Grenadiers" or "The English Gentleman". Despite his promotions, Neild had no previous military experience, and in 1899 Lord Beauchamp, the Governor, wrote that his organisation was "in a state of ridiculous insubordination". He was suspended around Easter of that year for publicly criticising a staff officer and encouraging insubordination; following unfavourable findings by a military inquiry, Neild avoided dismissal only by investing considerable amounts of money into the regiment.
Senate career.
Neild contested the first federal election in 1901, running as a Free Trade candidate for the Senate. Together with Senator Cyril Cameron, he was one of two parliamentarians to wear full dress uniform to the opening of Parliament. He introuced the Parliamentary Evidence Bill on 9 August 1901, which aimed "to enable and regulate the taking of evidence by Parliament and Parliamentary Committees". The bill was withdrawn and reintroduced several times over the next decade but never passed into law. Harbouring ambitions of becoming deputy President, Neild was active in many committees but failed to achieve his aim, although he did serve as Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1903 to 1910.
Neild was not a supporter of party discipline, refusing to follow Sir Josiah Symon's leadership of the Free Trade Senators. He spoke against the dictation test for non-British immigrants and the deportation of Kanaka workers, and continued to advocate free trade and old-age pensions. Having won the fifth position at the 1901 election, Neild faced re-election in 1903, and his impassioned support of the British Empire saw him elected at the head of the poll despite failing health.
In March 1904 Neild attacked the government's military policy and the commander of the military forces, Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, who had long wished to dismiss Neild from the citizen army. Neild had incited a near mutiny by destroying a well-known sergeant's military career, and was suspended from duty; Neild responded by accusing Hutton of intimidation and infringing a Senator's right of freedom of expression. In April 1904 the Senate formed a committee to investigate alleged contempt of Parliament by Hutton, which found that Neild had not been intimidated. In 1905 Neild retired from the militia.
Neild's adventures had seen him lose respect in his political career, and he was now openly mocked in the Senate chamber, becoming something of a joke. He introduced a number of bills in his remaining five years in the Senate, all of which lapsed. He spoke in support of Muslim camel drivers and opposed military training for boys, and continued to oppose elements of the White Australia policy, raising concerns about Australian-born children of Kanaka labourers: "They will have difficulties enough in front of them in a country that is so rampantly strong on the white Australia policy without our making their case worse." Neild was defeated at the 1910 election.
Suffering from hepatic cirrhosis, Neild died at his home in Woollahra on 8 March 1911, aged 65, survived by his second wife and their two children. He received a military funeral before being buried with Anglican rites at Waverley Cemetery in Sydney.

Edward Pulsford

Edward Pulsford (29 September 1844Â â 29 September 1919) was an English-born Australian politician and free-trade campaigner.
Pulsford established a successful business with his father as commission agents in Yorkshire before moving his interests to New South Wales in 1883. There he became a vigorous campaigner for free trade, and was a co-founder of the Free Trade and Liberal Association in that colony, the body that would later become the machine behind the Free Trade Party. Although his attempts to enter the New South Wales Legislative Assembly were abortive, he was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1895 and served until 1901, when he was elected to the Senate. An uncompromising opponent of all forms of protectionism, following the 1909 Fusion of the anti-Labour forces he joined the Liberal Party only with reluctance.
Pulsford is also remembered for his avid opposition to the White Australia policy and other forms of racial discrimination. Whilst financial editor of the "Daily Telegraph" he attacked restrictive immigration laws, and he fought against the policy in the state parliament and later in the Senate, where he was one of the few to oppose the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act. This racial tolerance, combined with his opposition to women's suffrage, has led the economist John Hawkins to describe him as "probably the least racist but perhaps the most sexist member of the Australian Senate in its first decade".
Early life.
Edward Pulsford was born at Burslem in Staffordshire on 29 September 1844. His mother was Mary Ann, "nÃ©e" Cutler, and his father, James Eustace Pulsford, was a Baptist minister and businessman. He received a private education and worked with his father as a commission agent; together they worked in Hull, Yorkshire, from 1870 to 1884. On 23 February 1870, he married Mary Charlotte Stainforth at Hull; she would predecease him. In 1883 Edward embarked for New South Wales, while his father travelled to New York to become resident secretary of the Liverpool, London & Globe Insurance Company. After his arrival in Sydney, Pulsford immediately became involved in the free trade cause, and in 1885 he co-founded the Free Trade and Liberal Association of New South Wales (FTLA, a forerunner of the Free Trade Party) with Bernhard Wise. His campaigning on behalf of free trade led to his becoming an honorary member of the Cobden Club.
Colonial politics.
From its foundation until 1891, Pulsford was secretary of the FTLA, and became an organiser and ferocious pamphleteer. He received a prize for an essay on "The Beneficial Influence of a Free Trade Policy upon the Colony of New South Wales", written as a contribution to the 1887 centennial edition of the Year-Book of Australia. He became actively involved in journalism as proprietor of the "Armidale Chronicle" and financial editor of the "Daily Telegraph" from 1890 to 1898. While focusing overwhelmingly on free trade, actively denigrating the neighbouring colony of Victoria's protectionist policies, he also worked on the compilation of an Australian biographical supplement to "Webster's International Dictionary" and supported Federation.
Pulsford was a leading proponent of the free-trade cause, although an intended candidacy for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1891 did not eventuate. He had contested a by-election for East Sydney earlier that year, losing to protectionist candidate Walter Bradley. He was nevertheless nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1895 by the Free Trade Premier, George Reid. He continued his support of free trade policies, but differentiated himself from his colleagues by firmly opposing restrictions on Asian immigration. He had expressed regret concerning the fate of the Australian Aborigines in a "Telegraph" article in 1888 and also opposed Sir Henry Parkes's poll tax on the Chinese, and now opposed the continuing restrictive measures passed in 1896 and 1898. He served as president of the Australian Free Trade and Liberal Association's New South Wales branch in 1900 and was deputy president of the federal election campaign committee, standing himself for the Senate in New South Wales.
Federal politics.
At the first federal election in March 1901, Pulsford was elected as a senator for New South Wales in the sixth and final position, narrowly defeating fellow Free Trader John Gray. He continued his fervent support of free trade and was one of the few senators to oppose the White Australia policy, describing "the whole of the inhabitants of Asia as friends". He opposed the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act, supported Asians' eligibility for the old-age pension, and decried the treatment of Kanaka labourers as "cattle". In his opposition to immigration restriction he highlighted the diplomatic insult to Japan and other Asian nations, and published a pamphlet in 1905 supporting the protestations of the Japanese government against the policy.
Pulsford spoke for five hours in the debate on the 1902 Customs Tariff Bill, although he later supported time limits for speeches. Missing out on a frontbench portfolio when the Free Traders were briefly in government from 1904 to 1905, he was absent from parliament for most of 1907. Described by the "Tribune" as "the best living authority on Australia's tariff question", his pamphlet to the Cobden Club in 1907 attracted a favourable reception. He opposed women's suffrage on the grounds that it would put Australia "in advance of public opinion throughout the world", believing it would lead to the "vulgarisation of women".
The Fusion in 1909 between the Free Trade and Protectionist parties to form the Liberal Party was difficult for Pulsford, who had "no faith in either the old Protection or the new Protection", and although he did join the new party, his support of any protectionist legislation would be "in order to show that all such legislation must be a failure". He was defeated at the 1910 election when the Labour Party won all the Senate seats in New South Wales.
Later life.
Pulsford continued his support for the free-trade cause outside Parliament, and in May 1914 planned to establish a free-trade paper to be circulated around Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, a scheme that was abandoned following the outbreak of World War I. He revised his book "Commerce and the Empire" (originally published in 1903) in 1917, arguing that free trade was central to the freedoms the Empire was fighting for, and calling for free trade with Germany after the war. On 2 March 1919 he married Blanche Elspeth Brown at Neutral Bay, but he died later that year on his seventy-fifth birthday, 29 September 1919. Survived by his second wife and the three sons of his first marriage, Pulsford was buried at Gore Hill cemetery after an Anglican service.

There's No One as Irish as Barack O'Bama

"There's No One as Irish as Barack O'Bama" is a humorous folk song written in 2008 by the Irish band Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys (later known as The Corrigan Brothers), and set to a tune derived from a traditional air. The song celebrates the Irish ancestry of the President of the United States, Barack Obama.
Production and themes.
Obama's roots have been traced back to Moneygall in County Offaly, Ireland in the 19th century. Moneygall has a population of 298 people. Obama had previously remarked, "There's a little village in Ireland where my great-great-great grandfather came from and I'm looking forward to going there and having a pint," prompting the Irish Taoiseach Brian Cowen - also a native of County Offaly - to invite him to do so.
Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys consists of brothers Ger, Brian and Donnacha Corrigan from Castletroy, County Limerick. The song was performed by the band's lead singer Ger Corrigan, with Aedhmar Flaherty, RÃ³isÃ­n O'Brien and AodhÃ¡n Ryan, in Ollie Hayes's pub in Moneygall. It was originally written by the established group in February 2008, and the group have since appeared on several Irish television and radio shows. It has since been featured on MSNBC show "Hardball with Chris Matthews".
The song, which received huge publicity in America and was described as a "web hit" by the BBC, became popular after being released on YouTube, and as of 6 November 2008 it had over 50,000 hits, (80,000 by 10 November, 300,000 by 15 November, whilst Black's version had 700,000) and the band reported that they had been invited to perform in the anticipated victory celebrations for Obama, and at the Irish-American Democrats inauguration party in Washington in January 2009.
Conflicts.
Ger Corrigan alleged that Shay Black, brother of Irish musician Mary Black, "hijacked" the song and claimed a co-writing credit while failing to acknowledge Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys' authorship of the original version, a charge Black denied.
Both sides sought legal advice; the band contacted YouTube's solicitors as well as a copyright solicitor before announcing in a press release that the dispute had been resolved.
Journalist Fintan O'Toole criticized the song in "The Irish Times" for "its ignorance of cultural history", claiming that it was inappropriate given Irish Americans' history of racism against African Americans, and that emphasizing Obama's Irish heritage would be "muscling in on his parade". Canon Stephen Neill, the rector of Moneygall who accompanied the band on their American trip, responded that it was only a pop song, and that African Americans had universally welcomed them.
Ger Corrigan later reported that the Corrigan Brothers had signed a deal with Universal for two singles and one album, with an option on a second album.
Welcome Home President Barack O'Bama.
In March 2011, the Corrigan Brothers released a new version of their song for radio play to celebrate Barack Obama's visit to Ireland the following May. Entitled "Welcome Home President Barack O'Bama", the song focused on Obama's visit to his ancestral home in Moneygall.

Tower Ladder (Devils Tower National Monument)

The Ladder at Devils Tower was first constructed and used in 1893 by William Rogers and Willard Ripley to publicly ascend Devil's Tower. Two years later Roger's wife Linnie ascended the tower via the ladder, one of a total of about 215 who have used the ladder. The last use was by Babe "The Human Fly" White in 1927. 
The present tower ladder consists of a series of wooden stakes connected on the outside by vertical wood planks. One end of each stake is driven sideways into a rock crevice, vertically ascending the southeast side of the tower. Attached with nails and/or bailing wire to the other end of the stakes are 12-inch lengths of 1 x 4 - inch lumber. The ladder ascends from about 100 feet above the ground to the summit, and is about 170 feet long. Because of its small scale in comparison to the tower, it is very difficult to see in modern photographs, and visitors to the tower usually must view it through a telescope. The lowest 100 feet were removed in the 1930s as a safety measure. The remaining ladder was restored in 1972.

King George Street (Jerusalem)

King George Street (, "Rehov HaMelekh George") is a street in central Jerusalem, Israel which joins Ben-Yehuda Street and Jaffa Road to form the Downtown Triangle central business district. The street was named in honor of King George V on December 9, 1924. 
History.
King George Street was dedicated in honor of the seventh anniversary of the British conquest of Jerusalem under General Allenby. The inauguration took place in 1924, in the presence of Sir Herbert Samuel, the High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Ronald Storrs, the military governor of Jerusalem, and Raghib al-Nashashibi, the Arab mayor of Jerusalem.
Jerusalem's first traffic light was installed at the intersection of King George Street and Jaffa Road. In 1950-1966, the Knesset, Israel's parliament, met at Beit Froumine on King George Street. It was used by Israel's first five governments, until the Knesset moved to a permanent building in Givat Ram. 
King George Street is one of two Jerusalem streets with a pedestrian scramble; the other is Kikar HaShabbat.
