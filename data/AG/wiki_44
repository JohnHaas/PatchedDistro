Hurricane Bonnie (1986)

Hurricane Bonnie caused moderate damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States in late June 1986. The second named storm and first hurricane of the 1986 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed out of an area of low pressure over the central Gulf of Mexico on June 23. The system gradually intensified and was declared Tropical Storm Bonnie the next day as it moved generally towards the west-northwest. On June 25, Bonnie was upgraded to a hurricane. Bonnie strengthened further and on the following day, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). Shortly thereafter, Bonnie made Landfall near High Island, Texas. Following landfall, Bonnie quickly weakened below tropical storm status and dissipated over Missouri on June 28.
Prior to Bonnie moving ashore, 22,000 people were evacuated in Texas and Louisiana. Upon making landfall, Hurricane Bonnie produced a storm surge peaking at 5.2 feet (1.5 m) at Sabine Pass. Rainfall from the storm peaked at 13 inches (330 mm) in Ace, Texas, which caused some street flooding and destroyed a small dam in Liberty County, Texas. Three fatalities were reported in the Port Arthur, Texas area; two deaths were from separate car accidents and another occurred after a partially paralyzed woman died in a house fire. Flooding also impacted northwestern Louisiana. In the Shreveport area alone, 381 homes, 20 businesses, and 80 major highway intersections were flooded. The hurricane also spawned 11 tornadoes, destroying about 25 houses in southwestern Louisiana. Overall, Hurricane Bonnie caused $42 million (1986 USD) in damage and five fatalities.
Meteorological history.
In mid-June, a mid-level center of circulation formed in association with a quasi-stationary cold front that stretched across northern Florida and the extreme northeast Gulf of Mexico. On June 20, a weak and disorganized area of low pressure developed in conjunction with the front and it passed by Tampa Bay, Florida the following day. Upon moving into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, there was little convection on observed on satellite imagery, although a distinguishable wind-shift was noted by an offshore buoy. However, by June 23, the presence of deep convection atop a circulation had become well-defined enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify the disturbance as a tropical depression, while centered 330 mi (535 km) southwest of Cape Coral, Florida. Moving generally west to west-northwestward across the central Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center sent a reconnaissance plane into the tropical depression at 1500 UTC on June 24, at which time winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were found. About three hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie.
In the 24 hours after becoming a tropical storm, satellite imagery showed a substantial increase in upper-level outflow as Tropical Storm Bonnie gradually intensified. A reconnaissance plane into the system shortly before 1200 UTC on June 25 revealed hurricane force winds above the surface. This evidence was the basis of Bonnie's upgrade to a Category 1 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 1800 UTC on June 25. During the afternoon hours of June 26, Bonnie reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 992 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg). While accelerating towards the northwest, the hurricane retained this intensity until landfall near High Island, Texas at 1000 UTC on June 26. Eight hours later, Bonnie weakened to a tropical storm and was downgraded to tropical depression status at 0000 UTC on June 27. The depression persisted until 1200 UTC on June 28, at which time it was absorbed by a frontal zone while located over the U.S. state of Missouri.
Preparations.
Upon the system being classified as a tropical depression, a high risk of landfall near Port Arthur, Texas was noted, giving federal officials sufficient lead time to warn local residents about a possible approaching hurricane. As the system neared landfall, tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for the Gulf Coast of the United States. At 1200 UTC on June 25, the National Hurricane Center issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch, stretching from Port O'Connor, Texas to the mouth of the Mississippi River. A few hours later, a hurricane warning was issued for area west of Morgan City, Louisiana to Freeport, Texas. In advance of the approaching storm, roughly 22,000 residents were evacuated, with 10,000 from Galveston County, Texas alone.
Impact.
Due to the small size of Hurricane Bonnie, damage was relatively light, totaling to $42 million. The storm was also attributed to five deaths, four in Texas and one in Louisiana.
Texas.
In some areas of eastern Texas, the storm dropped of rain, with a peak total of in Ace. Heavy rains caused by Bonnie also lead a small dam collapse in northeastern Liberty County, Texas, resulting in severe flooding. In Hardin County, the Pine Island Bayou overflowed, causing water to enter hundreds of homes and businesses. Several major roadways were flooded due to flooding, including Highway 59 between Livingston and Shepherd, U.S. Route 79 in Panola County, and Interstate 20 and several farm-to-market roads in Harrison County. The Bear Foot Lake dam overflowed, damaging some homes and forcing 200 families to evacuate. Overall, approximately 1,300 people in southeastern Texas fled their homes due to flooding. Severe flooding left behind by the heavy rains caused $5 million in damage.
In addition to rain and flooding, winds damaged more homes and businesses, and a tornado was spawned a few miles southwest of Port Arthur. More than 19,000 power outages were reported in the area near where Bonnie made landfall. Texas State Highway 87 was closed in Jefferson County due to debris and electrical poles fallen on the roadway. The storm left broken windows, scattered tree limbs, and debris filled streets in Port Arthur and Beaumont. At the latter, strong winds toppled a radio tower at the Texas Department of Public Safety building, while several schools suffered damage to the roof and windows. Marinas and boats at Lake Sam Rayburn were damaged. Hank Creek Marina, located across the lake, broke free from its moorings and floated away, while portions of were submerged. Four indirect fatalities were confirmed in Texas, two from traffic accidents, one from a house fire ignited by a candle, and another from drowning. Several injuries were also reported, including four after a truck flipped over due to strong winds.
Louisiana.
Most of the damage in Louisiana occurred in Cameron Parish. Twenty-five homes, trailers, and cabins in southwestern Louisiana were destroyed, resulting in about $400,000 in damages. Two tornadoes were spawned in Webster Parish. The first caused about $15,000 in damage to the roofs of three homes. The other tornado destroyed three mobile homes and severely damaged an additional two as well as three permanent homes. Damage from this tornado totaled $200,000. Just south of Blanchard, of rain fell within a 12-hour period. Interstate 20 was closed from Shreveport to the Louisiana-Texas state line due to flooding, with as much as of standing water near Greenwood.
Torrential rains caused water inundation up to in some areas of Shreveport. Firefighters used boats to rescue some stranded Shreveport residents in their homes by sudden high water. Rescuers also had to bind themselves together to rescue some people stranded in a flooded trailer park. Flooding in the city forced police to barricade 50 major highway intersections. Along the shore of Cross Lake, about 80 homes were damaged by water intrusion. About 381 homes and 20 businesses in Shreveport were damaged by flooding. A tornado spawned in the city overturned an airplane at Shreveport Downtown Airport, damaged a roof from a house, and shattered a number of windows. No injuries were reported from the tornado. Damage in Louisiana from flooding alone totaled $11–13 million, with $4 million to highways and bridges, $1–2 million to vehicles, $5 million to property, and $1–2 million to boats. Three fishermen were tossed into a lake after a boat was capsized due to high winds. Two were rescued, but one perished.
Elsewhere.
Heavy rains from the remnant low-pressure area of Bonnie led to heavy rains in several states in the Southeastern United States. Rainfall was generally minor in most areas, however in Arkansas, rains totaled up to 11.75 in (254 mm) at the South Arkansas Regional Airport. Several roads were washed out in Ouachita County near Elliott. A number of roads and bridges were also washed out in Union County, with damage totaling $200,000. U.S. Route 79 was closed between Magnolia and Stephens because of standing water. Three or four families evacuated near the Ouachita-Union County line after the Smackover Creek overflowed its banks and flooded 20 homes. There was also a small area of heavy rains totaling up to 5 in (127 mm) along the border of Tennessee and Georgia.

Illinois gubernatorial election, 2010

The election for Governor of Illinois was held on November 2, 2010. Incumbent Governor Pat Quinn, a Democrat, sought and was elected to a full term. Quinn was elected as the Democratic nominee, the Green Party nominee was Rich Whitney, the Republican nominee was State Senator Bill Brady, the Libertarian Party nominee was Lex Green, and Scott Lee Cohen ran as an independent. Governor Quinn won election to a full term in a very close race, beating Senator Brady by only about 32,000 votes, despite Brady winning in 98 of 102 Illinois counties.
Prior to the general election, the primary election in February 2010 featured extremely close races between candidates for the two largest parties' nominations. Quinn warded off a challenge by Comptroller Dan Hynes by a margin of about 8,300 votes, while Brady won the Republican nomination on the strength of less than a 200-vote margin in a fractured seven-way race.
The election marked the first time since 1852 that Democrats had won three consecutive Illinois gubernatorial elections.
Democratic primary.
Debates.
Democratic candidates Quinn and Hynes debated on January 19. WSIU Public Broadcasting (WSIU (FM)/WSIU-TV) at Southern Illinois University and Illinois Public Media (WILL AM/FM/TV) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign also co-sponsored two gubernatorial primary election debates. Pat Quinn and Dan Hynes debated on January 21, 2010.
Green primary.
Candidates.
Rich Whitney, 2006 Green Party nominee for Governor
General election.
Campaign.
After the February 2 Democratic primary in which incumbent Governor Pat Quinn was re-nominated, attention was drawn to Scott Lee Cohen, the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor. Illinois law required that candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor run in separate primary elections, but run as a ticket in the November general election. Cohen was criticized for his having been charged with domestic battery, in which he was accused of holding a knife to the throat of an ex-girlfriend who was also a convicted prostitute. Cohen was also accused by his ex-wife of physical abuse and using illegally obtained anabolic steroids. Quinn and Dick Durbin, Illinois's senior U.S. Senator, both said that Cohen should withdraw his candidacy, which he did on February 7. Cohen ran as an independent candidate for the office of Governor against Quinn.
On March 27, 2010, the Democratic State Central Committee chose a replacement candidate, Sheila Simon. Dan Hynes, who placed second in the gubernatorial primary, denied interest in replacing Cohen on the ticket. Other names suggested included State Representative Art Turner, who placed second to Cohen in the Democratic primary and then finished second to Simon in committee balloting on March 27, 2010; State Senators Rickey Hendon and Terry Link, State Representative Mike Boland, and electrician Thomas Castillo, all of whom also ran in the primary; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs official Tammy Duckworth; and State Representative Julie Hamos were suggested as possible replacements. Jeff Melvin, a 21-year retired Army veteran, also applied to the open nominating call for the Democratic Lieutenant Governor position.

Teng (mythology)

Teng () or Tengshe (; lit. "soaring snake") is a flying dragon in Chinese mythology.
Names.
This legendary creature's names include "teng" 螣 "a flying dragon" (or "te" 螣 "a plant pest") and "tengshe" 螣蛇 "flying-dragon snake" or 騰蛇 "soaring snake".
Teng.
The Chinese character for "teng" or "te" graphically combines a phonetic element of "zhen" "I, we (only used by emperors)" with the "insect radical" . This radical is typically used in characters for insects, worms, reptiles, and dragons (e.g., "shen" "a sea-monster dragon" or "jiao" "an aquatic dragon"). The earliest written form of "teng" 螣 is a (ca. 3rd century BCE) Seal script character written with the same radical and phonetic.
"Teng" 螣 has two etymologically cognate Chinese words written with this "zhen" 朕 phonetic and different radicals: "teng" (with the "water radical" ) "gush up; inundate; Teng (state); a surname" and "teng" (with the "horse radical" ) "jump; gallop; prance; mount; ascend; fly swiftly upward; soar; rise". This latter "teng", which is used to write the 騰蛇 "tengshe" flying dragon, occurs in draconic 4-character idioms such as "longtenghuyue" 龍騰虎躍 (lit. "dragon rising tiger leaping") "scene of bustling activity" and "tengjiaoqifeng" 騰蛟起鳳 ("rising dragon soaring phoenix", also reversible) "a rapidly rising talent; an exceptional literary/artistic talent; a genius".
The (3rd-2nd centuries BCE) "Erya" dictionary (16, tr. Carr 1990:111) defines "teng" 螣 as "tengshe" 螣蛇 "teng-snake", and Guo Pu's commentary glosses it as a "["feilong" 飛龍] flying dragon that drifts in the clouds and mist".
Some bilingual Chinese dictionaries translate "teng" as "wingless dragon", but this apparent ghost meaning is not found in monolingual Chinese sources. For instance, the Wiktionary and the Unihan Database translation equivalent for "teng" 螣 is "mythological wingless dragon of" . This dangling "of" appears to be copied from Robert Henry Mathews (1931:894) Chinese-English dictionary "A wingless dragon of the clouds", which adapted Herbert Giles's (1892:1352) dictionary "A wingless dragon which inhabits the clouds and is regarded as a creature of evil omen." While dragons are depicted as both winged and wingless (e.g., the lindworm "a bipedal wingless dragon"), Chinese dictionaries note "teng" "flying serpents" are "wuzu" 無足 "footless; legless" (see the "Xunzi" below) not "wingless".
Tengshe.
"The "teng" 螣 dragon", says Carr (1990:111), "had a semantically more transparent name of "tengshe" 騰蛇 'rising/ascending snake'." "Tengshe" is written with either "teng" 螣 "flying dragon" or "teng" 騰 "soaring; rising" and "she" 蛇 "snake; serpent"
From the original "flying dragon; flying serpent" denotation, "tengshe" acquired three additional meanings: "an asterism" in Traditional Chinese star names, "a battle formation" in Chinese military history, and "lines above the mouth" in physiognomy
First, "Tengshe" 螣蛇 Flying Serpent (or "Tianshe" 天蛇 "Heavenly Snake") is an asterism of 22 stars in the Chinese constellation "Shi" Encampment, which is the northern 6th of the 7 Mansions in the Xuanwu玄武 Black Tortoise constellation. These Tengshe stars spread across corresponding Western constellations of Andromeda, Lacerta, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, and Cygnus. In traditional Chinese art, Xuanwu is usually represented as a tortoise surrounded by a dragon or snake.
Second, "Tengshe" names "a battle formation". The (643-659 CE) "Beishi" history of Emperor Wencheng of Northern Wei Dynasty (r. 452-465 CE) describes a 454 CE battle. The Wei army routed enemy soldiers by deploying troops into over ten columns that changed between "feilong" "flying dragons", "tengshe" 螣蛇 "ascending snakes", and "yuli" 魚麗 "beautiful fishes" (alluding to "Shijing" 170).
Third, "Tengshe" "flying dragon" has a specialized meaning in "Xiangshu" 相術 "Chinese physiognomy", referring to "vertical lines rising from corners of the mouth".
Te.
The earliest occurrence of 螣 means "te" "a plant pest" instead of "teng" "a flying dragon". The (ca. 6th century BCE) "Shijing" (212 大田) describes farmers removing plant pests called "mingte" 螟螣 and "maozei" 蟊賊 in fields of grain. These "Shijing" names rhyme, and Bernhard Karlgren reconstructed them as Old Chinese *"d'ək" 螣 and *"dz'ək" 賊. The Mao Commentary glosses four insects; the "ming" 螟 eats hearts, the "te" 螣 eats leaves, the "mao" 蟊 eats roots, and the "zei" 賊 eats joints. Compare these translations:
Han Dynasty Chinese dictionaries write "te" 螣 "a plant pest" with the variant Chinese character . The "Erya" defines "ming" 螟 as "that eats seedlings and cores" and "te" 蟘 "that eats leaves". Guo Pu's commentary glosses these four pests as types of "huang" 蝗 "locusts; grasshoppers". The (121 CE) "Shuowen Jiezi" dictionary defines "ming" "insect that eats grain leaves" and "te" as "insect that eats sprout leaves".
The identity of this rare "te" 螣 or 蟘 "a grain pest" called remains uncertain. In Modern Standard Chinese usage, "te" only occurs as a literary archaism, while "ming" is used in words like "mingling" 螟蛉 "corn earworm; adopted son" and "mingchong" 螟虫 "snout moth's larva".
Classical usages.
Chinese classic texts frequently mention "tengshe" 螣蛇 or 騰蛇 "flying dragons". The examples below are roughly arranged in chronological order, although some heterogeneous texts are of uncertain dates. Only texts with English translations are cited, excluding "tengshe" occurrences in texts such as the "Guiguzi", "Shuoyuan", and "Shiji".
Xunzi.
The (ca. 4th century BCE) Confucianist "Xunzi" (1 勸學) first records the Classical Chinese idiom "tengshe wuzu er fei" 螣蛇無足而飛 "flying dragon is without feet yet flies", which figuratively means "success results from concentrating on one's abilities". 
Hanfeizi.
The (3rd century BCE) Legalist text "Hanfeizi" uses "tengshe" 騰蛇 in two chapters.
"Ten Faults" (十過, tr. Liao 1939:77) uses it describing the Yellow Emperor's heavenly music.
In by-gone days the Yellow Emperor once called a meeting of devils and spirits at the top of the Western T'ai Mountain, he rode in a divine carriage pulled by [龍] dragons, with Pi-fang a tree deity keeping pace with the linchpin, Ch'ih-yu war deity marching in the front, Earl Wind wind deity sweeping the dirt, Master Rain rain deity sprinkling water on the road, tigers and wolves leading in the front, devils and spirits following from behind, rising serpents rolling on the ground, and male and female phoenixes flying over the top. 
The "Critique on the Concept of Political Purchase" (難勢, tr. Ames 1983:74) quotes Shen Dao contrasting "feilong" 飛龍 "flying dragon" with "tengshe" 螣蛇 to explain "shi" "political purchase; strategic advantage".
Shen Tzu said: "The flying dragon mounts the clouds and the "t'eng" snake wanders in the mists. But when the clouds dissipate and the mists clear, the dragon and the snake become the same as the earthworm and the large-winged black ant because they have lost that on which they ride. Where men of superior character are subjugated by inferior men, it is because their authority is lacking and their position is low. Where the inferior are subjugated by the superior, it is because the authority of the latter is considerable and their position is high. 
Chuci.
The (3rd-2nd centuries BCE) "Chuci" parallels "tengshe" 騰蛇 with "feiju" 飛駏 "flying horse" in the poem "A Road Beyond" (通路, tr. Hawkes 1985:271).
With team of dragons I mount the heavens, In ivory chariot borne aloft. … I wander through all the constellations; I roam about round the Northern Pole. My upper garment is of red stuff; Of green silk is my under-robe. I loosen my girdle and let my clothes flow freely; I stretch out my trusty Gan-jiang sword. The Leaping Serpent follows behind me, the Flying Horse trots at my side. 
Huainanzi.
The (2nd century BCE) "Huainanzi" uses both "tengshe" graphic variants 螣蛇 (with the insect radical, chapters 9 and 18, which is not translated) and 騰蛇 (horse radical, chapter 17). 
"The Art of Rulership" (9 主術訓, tr. Ames 1981:176) uses "tengshe" 螣蛇 with "yinglong" 應龍 "responding dragon". The "t'eng" snake springs up into the mist; the flying "ying" dragon ascends into the sky mounting the clouds; a monkey is nimble in the trees and a fish is agile in the water." 
The "Discourse on Forests" (17 說林訓, tr. Carr 1990:111) has "tengshe" 騰蛇 in the same 遊霧 "drifts into the mist" phrase, "The ascending snake can drift in the mist, yet it is endangered by the centipede."
Other texts.
"Tengshe" frequently occurs in Chinese poetry. Two early examples are "The Dark Warrior shrinks into his shell; The Leaping Serpent twists and coils itself" ("Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mystery" by Zhang Heng, 78-139 CE, tr. Knechtges 1982:127), and "Though winged serpents ride high on the mist, They turn to dust and ashes at last" ("Though the Tortoise Lives Long" by Cao Cao, 155-220 CE, tr. Ward 2008:19).
Mythology.
The Chinese books above repeatedly parallel the "tengshe" "soaring snake; flying dragon" with its near synonym "feilong" "flying dragon". Like the "tianlong" "heavenly dragon", these creatures are associated with clouds and rainfall, as Visser (1913:109) explains.
The Classics have taught us that the dragon is thunder, and at the same time that he is a water animal akin to the snake, sleeping in pools during winter and arising in spring. When autumn comes with its dry weather, the dragon descends and dives into the water to remain there till spring arrives again. 
The (1578 CE) "Bencao Gangmu" (43, tr. Read 1934:349) mentions this mythic serpent, "There are flying snakes without feet such as the 螣蛇 "T'eng She"." The commentary (tr. Visser 1913:75) explains, "The "t'eng-she" changes into a dragon. This divine snake can ride upon the clouds and fly about over a thousand miles. If it is heard, (this means) pregnancy."
Wolfram Eberhard (1968:385-6) surveys the cultural background of "tengshe" "ascending snake" myths.
Frequently, in the early literature, the snake steps into the clouds ["Shenzi", "Baopuzi", "Huainanzi"]. Here one suspects that the word dragon was taboo and had to be substituted; this is confirmed by Chung-ch'ang T'ung ["Hou Han Shu"] stating that the ascending snake loses it scales. One can hardly speak of scales in the case of a real snake, but a dragon was believed to be scaly. Otherwise this flying snake may be compared with the folktale of the fight between centipede and snake which is associated with Thai culture … The dragon-like snake in the sky is again the dragon "lung", again of the Thai cultures. Otherwise the "ascending snake" ("t'eng-she") may mean a constellation of stars near the Milky Way ["Xingjing"]. According to Ko Hung ["Baopuzi"] it makes lightning, and this again equates it with the dragon "lung". 
Legends about flying snakes, serpents, and dragons are widespread in comparative mythology, exemplified by the Biblical Fiery flying serpent. Snakes in the genus Chrysopelea are commonly known as "flying snakes".

Uskmouth power stations

The Uskmouth power stations (also known as the Fifoots Point power stations) refers to a series of two coal-fired power station at the mouth of the River Usk in the south-east of Newport, Wales. The first of the two station, Uskmouth A power station, was built in the 1950s and demolished in the 1990s. The second station, Uskmouth B power station, was built in the 1960s.
Uskmouth A.
Uskmouth A power station was built and opened in the early 1950s. It was closed on 26 October 1981 with a generating capacity of 228 megawatts. The station was demolished in 2002
Uskmouth B.
Uskmouth B power station (or Uskmouth Power as it is now known) was built in 1959. It has a generating capacity of 363 MW, which is enough to power 360,000 homes, or the surrounding area of Newport. The electricity is provided by three generating sets. It is situated in an essential position for the National Grid, as there are very few power stations situated in the south of Wales. Initially operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board, the station's operations were handed over to National Power with privatisation in 1990. The station was then closed in 1995. But in 1998, it was purchased by AES. The station was given a £120 million refurbishment to bring it up to date with legislative requirements. New environmental equipment was installed and it was given a refurbishment which is thought to have extended the station's life by 25 years. The station's generating capacity was also increased to 393 MW. In 2001 the work was completed and the station was reopened. However, only a year later the plant passed into receivership, but had a brief period of operating in the winter between 2003 and 2004. In June 2004 the station was put back into full operation, when it was bought by Welsh Power, who were then known as Carron Energy. Welsh Power sold it to SSE (Scottish and Southern Energy plc) in 2009 for £27m.
The station is currently one of the cleanest coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, and is fitted with Flue Gas Desulphurisation equipment and low NOx burners. It also burns biomass, as well as coal, for its emissions to be considered closer to being carbon neutral. The station does not take water from or dump waste water into the River Usk. It instead uses secondary treated sewage water in its cooling system.
The station employs 90 people. It has been awarded RoSPA Gold Award for Occupational Health and Safety for its efforts to ensure station safety. The station's owners have participated in many local community projects – they donated land to the Newport Wetlands Reserve, and sponsor Welsh swimmer David Davies and the Newport Gwent Dragons.
Gas-fired station.
An 824 megawatt (MW) gas-fired power station has been built on the site of the A station by Siemens for Severn Power, a subsidiary of DONG Energy. It was initially reported that it would cost £400 million to build and create 650 construction jobs. It is expected to come on line at the end of 2010 and employ 40 full-time staff.
Uses in culture.
In 2006, the station was used as a location for two episodes of "Doctor Who". In the episodes "Rise of the Cybermen" and "The Age of Steel", the station was used as the setting for the Cybermen Factory. It was then used again for the 2011 Christmas special "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe" as spaceship corridors, filmed on 20 September 2011.

Orphic Egg

The Orphic Egg in the Ancient Greek Orphic tradition is the cosmic egg from which hatched the primordial hermaphroditic deity Phanes/Protogonus (variously equated also with Zeus, Pan, Metis, Eros, Erikepaios and Bromius) who in turn created the other gods. The egg is often depicted with a serpent wound about it.
Symbolism.
The egg symbolizes the belief in the Greek Orphic religion that the universe originated from within a silver egg. The first emanation from this egg, described in an ancient hymn, was Phanes-Dionysus, the personification of light.
In Greek myth, particularly Orphic thought, Phanes is the golden winged Primordial Being who was hatched from the shining Cosmic Egg that was the source of the universe. Called Protogonos (First-Born) and Eros (Love) — being the seed of gods and men — Phanes means "Manifestor" or "Revealer," and is related to the Greek words "light" and "to shine forth."
An ancient Orphic hymn addresses him thus: "Ineffable, hidden, brilliant scion, whose motion is whirring, you scattered the dark mist that lay before your eyes and, flapping your wings, you whirled about, and through this world you brought pure light."

Lucius Aurelius Avianius Symmachus

Lucius Aurelius Avianius Symmachus "signo" Phosphorius (died 376) was a politician of the Roman Empire, father of Quintus Aurelius Symmachus.
Biography.
A member of the aristocratic family of the Symmachi, he was the son of Marcus Aurelius Valerius Tullianus Symmachus, consul for 330. He had one daughter and four sons, among whom were Celsinus Titianus and the most influential of the Symmachi, the orator Quintus Aurelius Symmachus. Avianius was a pagan senator, and was member of several priestly "collegia", including the "Pontefices Vestae" and the "quindecimviri sacris faciundi" (from 351 to 375).
Before January 350 he had been appointed prefect to the "annona", later becoming "vicarius urbis Romae". In 361, he went to Antioch (in Syria), where he probably met Libanius, to meet Emperor Constantius II: it is probable that the Roman Senate wanted to assure its loyalty to the ruling emperor after receiving a letter from Julian, cousin and caesar of Constantius, who had been just proclaimed emperor by his troops. On their way back, Symmachus and his colleague Valerius Maximus travelled through "Nassus", where they were received by Julian with all the honours.
Between 364 and 365 he held the office of "praefectus urbi" of Rome, under the rule of Valentinian I. As praefect, he restored the ancient "pons Agrippae" on the Tiber (on the place of the modern Ponte Sisto), which took the name of "pons Valentiniani"; Symmachus even paid for a lavish public celebration for the inauguration of this bridge. Ammianus Marcellinus has a flattering opinion of his mandate.
His house was on the right side of the Tiber, in Trastevere, and was burned down by the plebs during a riot in 367. According to the story told by Ammianus, the riot originated from a rumour, diffused by a member of the plebs, according to which Symmachus, during his prefecture, had said that "he would prefer putting out the limekilns with his own wine, to selling the lime at the price expected of him"; forgetting the prosperity achieved during Symmachus' office, the enraged plebs burnt down his house. Avianio left the city following this offence caused by "envy", that he tried to heal by writing a literary work. After a while, however, the plebs changed their minds and started supporting Symmachus, even asking for a punishment of the offenders. Symmachus returned to Rome, by request of the Roman Senate, whom he thanked on 1 January 376; the senators, even the Christians, proposed him to Emperor Gratian as praetorian prefect and consul for year 377.
Avianius Symmachus died in 376, as consul-elect. The following year, his memory was honoured with a gilded statue, erected by imperial decree after a request of the Senate, on 29 April.
Culture.
Avianius Simmachus is described by his son as a reader of every kind of literature. He composed a small number of epigrams of low quality about members of the Constantinian age, such as Amnius Anicius Iulianus and Lucius Aradius Valerius Proculus.
Among his correspondents there was Vettius Agorius Praetextatus, who was a member of the pagan and senatorial aristocracy.

Michèle Lamont

Michèle Lamont (born in Toronto, Canada in 1957) is a sociologist and is the Robert I. Goldman Professor of European Studies and a Professor of Sociology and African American Studies at Harvard University.
Career.
Having completed a BA and MA in political science at Ottawa University in 1979, Michèle Lamont received her PhD in Sociology from the Université de Paris in 1983. A post-doctoral Fellow at Stanford University from 1983–1985, Lamont later served as Assistant Professor at the University of Texas-Austin (1985–1987), and Princeton University (1987–1993). In 1993 she was awarded tenure at Princeton, and was made full professor in 2000. During this time, Lamont was also a visiting professor at the Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques (Science Po), Université de Paris 8, École des hautes études en sciences sociales, and Tel Aviv University, among other places. She has been a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Studies at Stanford, the recipient of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship, and a fellow of the Russell Sage Foundation. She chairs the Council for European Studies and Harvard’s European Network on Inequality. She is the recipient of numerous scholarly awards and distinctions for her work on race, class, and academic culture.
Contributions to sociology.
Lamont’s major works compare how people's shared concepts of worth influence and sustain a variety of social hierarchies and inequality.
Lamont’s early writing formulated influential criticisms of the work of Pierre Bourdieu, a leading sociologist with whom she studied in Paris. Her first book, "Money, Morals, Manners", showed that Bourdieu’s theories of cultural capital and habitus ignore moral status signals and national repertoires that explain differences in American and French class attitudes and behavior. This criticism set the stage for a large American literature that was critical of, but built upon, the work of Bourdieu. This movement coincided with the birth of cultural sociology in American Sociology. With fellow sociologists Ann Swidler, Michael Schudson, and Paul DiMaggio, Lamont contributed to setting the agenda for the scholarly study of “meaning-making” In sociology. The research of Lamont and colleagues demonstrated the importance of considering various aspects of culture as explanans and explanandum in the social sciences. —as something more than a “residual category.”
Lamont’s distinction between “symbolic” and “social” boundaries provides a framework within which to analyze the independent causal role of individual’s worldviews in explaining structural phenomena such as inequality. Symbolic boundaries are “conceptual distinctions made by social actors…that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership.” Conversely, “social boundaries are objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to an unequal distribution of resources… and social opportunities.” In making this distinction, Lamont acknowledges that symbolic boundaries are a “necessary but insufficient” condition for social change. “Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character… and become social boundaries.”
Lamont’s more recent work has applied the “boundary-work” framework to the case of American and French race relations. In her award-winning "Dignity of Working Men", Lamont shows how white and African-American conceptions of class are grounded in vastly different conceptions of self-worth. In a new collaborative project that grew out of this research, Lamont is comparing the anti-racist strategies of marginalized groups in the United States, Brazil, and Israel. In another collaborative project with Peter Hall, Lamont is leading a group of influential scholars who study “Successful Societies,” and more specifically, how the interpenetration of institutions and cultural repertoires (including recognition) affect the health and well-being of communities.
Her forthcoming book, "How Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment", builds upon another research agenda on the sociology of knowledge to explain how academic funding panels reach consensus on what is academically worthy – on what constitutes good research.

Sharp Nemesis

The Sharp DR 90 Nemesis is a Formula One racing aircraft designed by Jon Sharp and built at the Mojave Airport by the Nemesis Air Racing Team. The aircraft is powered by a modified Continental O-200 piston engine.
The Nemesis originated as an attempt by Jon Sharp to build a Shoestring racer, with composite skins over a steel frame. Along the way, Dan Bond convinced him to use an airfoil with extensive laminar flow and finally, Steve Ericson helped Jon design a sleeker, all composite airframe. All that remains of the original “plastic Shoestring” is the horizontal tail. The steel space frame was sold to Dan Gilbert and became the guts of his Shadow Formula One air racer. Although Shadow looks much like Nemesis it is fabricated differently and has a completely different wing.
The success of the aircraft led Jon Sharp to design a follow-on type, the Nemesis NXT.
Racing career.
Between 1991 and 1999, the plane won 45 of the 48 race events in which it was entered, including nine consecutive Reno Gold National Championships. During each of the race seasons from 1994 through 1999, Nemesis finished as the International Formula One points champion. Nemesis was awarded the George Owl Trophy for its design in 1991, three Louis Blèriot Medals from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (1993, 1996 and 1998), and four Pulitzer Trophies (1993, 1994, 1995 and 1999). The aircraft set 16 world speed records, and in one of those records, Nemesis was clocked at over 290 mph (467 km/h). Because of its successes, the National Air and Space Museum has described the plane as "the most successful aircraft in air racing history".
Display.
After the end of the 1999 racing season, Jon Sharp donated the aircraft to the National Air and Space Museum, and it is now on display at the NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.

<doc id="20300897" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20300897" title="Karim el-Mejjati">
Karim el-Mejjati

A French citizen born in Morocco, Karim Thami el-Mejjati (October 30, 1967 – April 2005) was a Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group militant claimed to have aided the Riyadh compound bombings, the 2003 Casablanca bombings, the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the 2005 London bombings.
He was killed, along with his 11-year-old son, by Saudi authorities in a series of raids in April 2005. His wife maintains that he was not connected to all the attacks, but insinuates that he had arranged attacks against Saudi Arabia, provoking their anger.
Life.
A medical student, el-Mejjati was born to a wealthy Moroccan father who worked in commerce and French mother who worked in cosmetics. They enrolled him in a French-speaking school from which he graduated in 1986. He also spoke English and sub-par Arabic. He kept a poster of Clint Eastwood taped to his bedroom wall, and dreamed of traveling to the United States. A secular Muslim, he reportedly ate pork and drank alcohol in violation of Islamic law, and enjoyed partying at Les Sablettes beach resort, as well as visiting Ceuta and Melilla.
On September 25, 1991, he married a Tunisian-American named Fatiha, who was seven years older than he was and had been dismissed from her job at the Casablanca medical school where he was studying because she started wearing the niqab face-covering. A 1985 law graduate, she later remarked that the student unrest over the management's attempts to fire her were likely what brought both her and el-Mejjati back to being observant Muslims. He dropped out of medical school, and they traveled to an Islamic conference in Paris for a month. They had two sons, named Ilyass and Adam.
By 1992, he'd returned to France and begun selling Moroccan handicrafts to support his desire to travel and volunteer as a Bosnian mujahideen. After one tour in Bosnia, he returned to bring his wife back to the Balkans with him, but was stymied by Germany's refusal to grant a visa. Returning alone, he was arrested for a month by Croatian forces, before being released at the request of the French government, although he was forbidden to return to Bosnia for five years.
Upon returning to Morocco, he rented a two-room apartment and began wearing Afghan clothing and a long beard. When women visited, he and his male friends would sleep in their cars parked on the street, while the women slept inside. Neighbours later recalled that he once loudly berated a couple for their public display of affection.
In early 1994, he traveled to Mecca on the hajj pilgrimage, and then continued on to Afghanistan, where he enrolled at the Khalden training camp where he contracted malaria and had to be sent home to Morocco. Once, upon returning to Morocco, he was questioned about the Pakistani visa in his passport and the Abdullah Azzam book he was reading.
Around this time, his wife was diagnosed with cancer. He maintained a relationship with Yusuf Fikri, leader of the Takfir wal-Hijra.
In 1996 he took a second wife at the urging of his wife, the Belgian Fatihah al-Hawshy who lived in England and was a friend of his wife.
Around 1997, he traveled to New Jersey on the invitation of a friend for several months. It was one of two visits he made to the United States prior to 1999. He later listed the address of a New York bookseller, Abdulrahman Farhane, as his own - later entered as evidence against Farhane following accusations he financially supported terrorism.
While American authorities claimed he hadn't entered the country since 1999, Saudi media reported that he traveled back to the United States with al-Hawshy, his second wife, in 2000 and dropped her off there while he traveled to Pakistan.
In July 2001, el-Mejjati and his wife determined to leave Morocco permanently, and flew to Spain for two weeks while awaiting their entry visa to Iran. When Italy declined their request for travel documents, they flew out of Frankfurt instead. After landing in Tehran, they crossed the border into Afghanistan the following day. He traveled to Kandahar, ostensibly to seek out Osama bin Laden even though he had no intentions of joining al-Qaeda, but was disappointed to discover the militant leader had already left the city. He later managed to see both bin Laden and Mullah Omar.
Following the American reprisal bombings following the September 11 attacks, el-Mejjati and his wife left Afghanistan and traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh where they remained for ten months after their passports were seized due to fake Pakistani visa stamps. They moved to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, using false Qatari passports, after that. Some have claimed the move was authorised by bin Laden to build a "Saudi network".
Entry into militant plots.
After moving to Riyadh, el-Mejjati agreed to allow Khalid al-Juhani, a veteran of the First Chechen War and Afghan Civil War who was being sought by Americans, stay with his family. He asked his wife to help him find a wife for al-Juhani, who was not supposed to be involved in any more fighting.
On March 23, 2003, his wife and 10-year old son Ilyass left the city to try to reach an Ophthalmologist. They had been originally intended to travel with al-Juhani, which caught the attention of the Mabahith secret police. However, al-Juhani argued he wasn't feeling well and asked a brother and his wife to instead accompany el-Mejjati and her son. The group was nonetheless arrested by authorities who hoped that al-Juhani was present. When questioned, his wife confirmed to police that el-Mejjati was indeed living in Riyadh, but refused to write an open letter in the newspapers calling for her husband to surrender himself to authorities stating that he hadn't done anything wrong.
After his wife's arrest, he is believed to have fallen in with the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group, and to have provided training to its members in a forest outside Rabat. His name was mentioned in connection with the Riyadh compound bombing in May of that year.
Days before the May 16 attack in Casablanca, el-Mejjati is believed to have fled to Spain. Arguments that he had dressed as a woman to travel unnoticed were rebuffed by his wife who pointed out he stood 6'4".
On June 20, 2003, when it was discovered that al-Juhani had been among the men killed in the Riyadh compound bombings, Saudi Arabia transferred el-Mejjati's wife and son to Moroccan custody, flying them on a private jet through Cairo into Morocco.
In September 2003, the FBI issued an alert for four people they alleged "pose a threat to U.S. citizens", including Abderraouf Jdey, Adnan G. El Shukrijumah and the previously unknown Zubayr al-Rimi and el-Mejjati.
While in Spain, el-Mejjati became associated with Jamal Zougam, who had helped construct the bombs, leading to the suggestion that he had been involved in the March 11 Madrid bombings.
In December 2003, he was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment "in absentia" by a Moroccan court, for his role in the Casablanca bombings.
On March 17, 2004, his wife and son were released from prison. Police set up a 24-hour stakeout of her house, and watched her every move. In April, Belgian newspapers in Antwerp received threatening notes that made reference to el-Mejjati, and suggested that Jewish locations in the city might become targets in the future. While authorities now began searching Europe in earnest for his whereabouts, others suggested that he had fled to Pakistan, Iran, Syria or Iraq. In early 2005, Riyadh officials intercepted text messages being sent by el-Mejjati to Great Britain authorising hawala money transfers.
Death.
el-Mejjati, as well as his 11 year old son Adam and the leader of al-qaeda in Saudi Arabia Saud Hamoud 'Abid al-Qatini al-'Otaibi, were among those killed in April 2005 in a series of Ar Rass raids by Saudi authorities. Saudi security forces had not known el-Mejjati would be present when they surrounded their first target, a house with approximately eight occupants. When shooting began, the occupants fled to a nearby construction site where the battle lasted until the following morning. A columnist later suggested that el-Mejjati had shot his son after he was captured by Saudi forces. Saudi authorities also alleged that el-Mejjati had killed a foreigner living in the Kingdom, and attacked a police patrol in Al-Ghat "with the support of his son", despite being only 11 years old.
At the time of his death, he was #4 on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's "26 Most Wanted" list.
el-Mejjati was survived by his wife and 12-year old son Ilyass. A friend of the family had phoned to tell her that he had just heard a report that el-Mejjati had been killed on the television, to which she replied "Alhamdulillah". She then wrote to the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior, and its Saudi counterpart, to ask them to positively confirm the identity of her husband and son through DNA testing, with which they complied.
His wife sought permission to travel to Saudi Arabia to claim the body of her husband and son for proper burial, and proposed traveling with his second wife, stating that she could not find closure until she had seen the bodies herself.
Aftermath.
His wife later gave an interview to France 3 television following his death, in addition to Moroccan newspapers; stating that her husband had been a mujahideen, and not a terrorist. However, in other interviews she stubbornly stated that it was wrong to consider him a member of GICM since he "only belongs to Al-Qaeda".
Later analysts suggested that he was closely tied to Salafia Jihadia or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
Following the July 7 bombings in London three months after his death, Saudi Arabia stated that they had warned Britain of the impending attack, sending them an intelligence file that contained details of el-Mejjati and his alleged connection to lead bomber Mohammad Sidique Khan.

Millennium Dome raid

The Millennium Dome raid was an attempted robbery of the Millennium Dome's diamond exhibition in Greenwich, South East London occurring on November 7, 2000. A local gang including Lee Wenham, Raymond Betson and William Cockram had planned to ram-raid the De Beers diamond exhibition which was being held in the dome at the time. The gang had then planned to escape via the Thames in a speedboat. The De Beers diamond exhibition had a number of jewels on display including the Millennium Star, a flawless gem with an estimated worth of £200 million and considered one of the most perfect gems in the world. Also on display were priceless blue diamonds. The attempted robbery was foiled by the Flying Squad of the Metropolitan Police Service, who already had the gang members under surveillance for their suspected roles in a number of unsuccessful armoured vehicle robberies. The operation to foil the robbery was the biggest operation undertaken in the Flying Squad's history and at trial the judge in the case made a special point of commending the way it was carried out.
If the heist succeeded, then with a haul of £350 million worth of diamonds, it would have become the biggest robbery in history, with only the later US$1 billion Central Bank of Iraq withdrawal exceeding it.
Operation Magician.
In the summer of 2000, the flying squad became aware of a major armed robbery plot after a tip off was received. The location of this robbery was unclear, but the identities of some of the robbers were known to the police. The police spent a number of months developing intelligence on the plot and set up an operation which they codenamed Operation Magician. During the intelligence gathering the location of the robbery was found to be The Millennium Dome in Greenwich.
In February 2000, armed men tried to pull off a £10 million raid on a security van in Nine Elms, South London. The gunmen had stopped the security lorry by blocking off both ends of Nine Elms Lane. They had planned to use their own lorry, which was carrying Christmas trees, as a battering ram. This lorry had a huge metal spike welded into the chassis and covered by the foliage. The gang planned to split the security lorry's rear doors with the ram. The gang's plan failed when a motorist who was late for work removed the keys from the ignition of the unattended Christmas tree van. The robbers, left with no choice, made their escape in an inflatable speedboat towards Chelsea.
It was attempted again on 7 July in Aylesford, Kent, this time, the gang got even closer to cash with the metal spike being rammed into the van, they were seconds from taking the money until an unexpected police car appeared, causing the gang to shoot towards the car and again, they made their escape in the inflatable speedboat.
Detective Superintendent John Shatford stated that this attempted robbery brought to his attention a gang out there which was capable of carrying out a robbery with this level of planning. Fifteen months after this attempted robbery, there was another case where a gang tried to pull off another robbery using similar techniques. This unsuccessful attack provided the police with important clues and led the police to track some of the vehicles which were used in the raid to two isolated farms in rural Kent; these properties were then put under 24-hour surveillance.
After this unsuccessful robbery the police received a tip-off about the Dome raid from an informer. At a meeting between detectives to discuss the Nine Elms Lane attempted robbery and the information that the informer had provided about the Dome raid, one detective who had recently visited the dome quipped, ""Maybe they are after the Millennium jewels?"". It was this comment that led to the investigation into the raid to begin.
Surveillance.
On 1 September 2000 the team identified three of the suspected robbers, Wenham, Betson and Cockram at the dome. It was then found that every time they had visited the attraction, the Thames was a high tide. They were observed visiting the exhibition and recording video footage. As a result of the men being observed at the exhibition, the police began to suspect that the exhibition could be a target. The surveillance on the men was significantly increased and the dome was placed under close watch. The precautions taken by the flying squad included replacing the priceless gems with replicas of the same size. This allowed for the originals to be stored elsewhere. Due to an increase in surveillance, the police discovered other members of the gang. These included Terry Millman who was tasked with obtaining the getaway speedboat which was to be used for the escape.William Cockram and Raymond Betson were also observed filming the surrounding river and jetty. The surveillance on the gang continued and their visits to the dome became more frequent. In late September a few members of the gang were spotted testing a speedboat in a harbour in Kent.[7
Aborted robbery attempts.
The Metropolitan Police were able to identify the possible days that the raid could take place and communicated this information to De Beers and the dome management. Two of the days that the police had identified resulted in aborted attempts. The first aborted attempt occurred in early October and was called off due to the malfunctioning of the speedboat which was to be used for the getaway. The second aborted attempt occurred one day before the date of the actual raid but was called off as the gang discovered the tide was too low to ensure a safe getaway. After the second aborted attempt the police suspected the raid was imminent and were convinced the raid would take place the following day. As a result of this the police replaced all dome staff with armed undercover officers. On a number of days in October, the gang under surveillance looked as if they were about to commence with the raid. Some members of the gang were spotted towing a speedboat to Greenwich and then placing the boat in the river opposite the Dome. This activity indicated to the squad that the robbery was close; however this was not the case. As a result of this the police investigated the reason behind the delay. The detectives analysed the times and days of the aborted attempts and found that they had something in common - the High tide. On closer investigation the detectives found that on each of the days when the robbery was aborted the tide was at its highest possible level. The police began to investigate the patterns of the tide and were able to predict the possible times that the raid was to take place. One of the predicted days happened to be the date of the actual raid.
Day of raid.
On 7 November at 9:30am, the police operation codenamed "Operation Magician" was underway and was commanded by Detective Superintendent Jon Shatford of the Metropolitan Police. The officers involved in the operation included a total of 200 officers of which forty were from the Specialist Firearms Command (SCO19). A further sixty armed Flying Squad officers were stationed around the Thames, and 20 on the river itself to hamper any escape attempts. Surveillance officers were also disguised as dome employees. The Millennium dome's CCTV room was used by the police as a control room. All the officers were briefed at 3am on the day of the raid, the briefing detailed the contingency plans which were in place. Before the raid some officers were positioned behind a dummy wall and others were dressed as cleaners and Dome employees with their firearms concealed. Before the raid four members of the gang were identified in a JCB earth digger and all were wearing body armor with gas masks. The men were armed with smoke bombs, sledgehammers and nail guns and these were to be used to penetrate the security glass protecting the exhibit. The JCB was used by the gang to break through the perimeter fence and to crash through the side wall of the Dome to reach the money zone. The JCB came into the Dome itself and it parked outside the Money Zone, once inside Ciarrocchi started throwing smoke bombs and William Cockram attempted to break the glass where the diamonds were stored. Inside the dome, Cockram knew that the glass could resist the force of a 60-ton ram raid but his plan was to weaken the glass with three shots from a powerful Hilti nailgun and then another gang member, Robert Adams would then use a sledgehammer to break the weakened glass. The plan was working and the gang were inches away from the diamonds. Robert Adams was quoted as saying ""I was 12 inches from pay day"", later stating ""It would have been a blinding Christmas"". The police pounced on four members of the gang as they attempted to smash their way into the display case using sledgehammers and a nail gun. As these four men were being arrested, the other officers who were stationed around the dome arrested another man who was in a high-powered boat on the Thames. The police also arrested another man who they suspected of monitoring police radio frequencies. This suspect was detained on the north shore of the Thames opposite the Dome. All the suspects were apprehended, Terry Millman was apprehended in a van. Once all the suspects had been detained they were taken to police stations in South London. On the day of the raid by 1200 GMT some areas of the Dome had re-opened, but other areas, including the Money Zone, were cordoned off. 
At the scene of the arrest David James, the Dome's former executive chairman stated ""They were all on the ground trussed up like Christmas turkeys"." He added ""It was relatively calm and they were almost joking with the police who were standing over them with guns"". Detective Superintendent Jon Shatford defended the decision that was taken to wait until the gang had reached the diamonds before arresting them. He said ""Our chief concern throughout was public safety. We decided it was better to let the robbers get to the vault where they were effectively imprisoned".
The serious crime unit of the Kent Police worked in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police Service and arrested six more people in connection with the raid on the Dome on Tuesday morning. These arrests were made in the village of Collier Street and Horsmonden. Police said the ages of the men ranged between 38 and 62.
Trial.
This is how: The case came to trial a year later on 8 November 2001, the case was heard at the Old Bailey and only six members of the gang were present as Terry Millman had died of cancer. The court heard that Betson, Cockram, Aldo Ciarrocchi and Robert Adams were caught by officers who were undercover in the dome when they burst into the dome using a JCB digger. On the first day of the defence case, William Cockram explained about the lack of security inside the dome. ""I couldn't believe how simple it was"", he also added "I was thinking, this cannot be true, It was a gift. At first I had thought it was pie in the sky, but after going down there I couldn't believe security was so bad... There was nobody in the vault, no security workers walking around".". He stated that had the plan succeeded ""It would have taken a very short time from hitting the main gate to getting back across the Thames - five minutes maximum."". In his defense Cockram also added ""No one was going to get hurt - there was no one to hurt",", ""The dome was always empty".". Cockram explained that the nail gun that was bought by the gang was to be used to break the glass in the vault and not as a weapon. The ammonia he said was to be used to contaminate any traces of blood left by him. He explained that the body armor that he wore was to be used after the raid for protection when he was scheduled to attend a meeting with associates to discuss the sale of the gems. Raymond Betson at trial told the jury that his brother in law Pc Michael Waring who was working at the Dome as part of the perimeter security had told him about a school friend named Tony who was also working at the dome. Mr Betson claimed that Michael Waring had told him about a plan that Tony had put together," "Tony had got this plan together. He had a backer - someone to buy the jewellery. He said the security was crap"". Mr Betson then went on to say, ""I had every confidence in him - there was no way I thought he would betray me - not for two seconds"". ""If this had come to me from someone else - in a pub - I would not have gone along with it but it was the background to where it had come from. It was solid"". Mr Betson explained how he developed a trusting relationship with Waring, he said ""I did not think he would try and do me any harm. I trusted him"." At the trial the jury were also told by William Cockram that Mr Betson had told him, that his brother in law was in on the plan. William Cockram went on to say ""He said he had inside help through Pc Michael Waring"". When called as a prosecution witness Pc Michael Waring ""totally denied"" he was part of the plan or had offered to act in a criminal way by providing information on security. At the trial the jury were told that the gang had invested tens of thousands planning the raid and they stored the equipment they needed at a disused commercial yard in Plumstead, South-East London, as well as two remote Kent farms near Maidstone. Terry Millman who had died of cancer before the trial date used the name T. Diamond when he paid £3,700 in cash to purchase a getaway speed-boat at a yard in the seaside town of Whitstable, Kent.
At the trial prosecuting QC Martin Heslop said ""the raid was planned professionally, carefully and down to the last detail"" "he also added "So well organised was it that it would probably have succeeded, had it not been for an equally professional, careful and detailed police operation"". QC Martin Heslop stated that in order to minimize the risk to the public ""Arrangements were made to keep children away from the danger area, but for obvious reasons it was not practicable to alert all staff to the possibility of an attack"". The time taken for the case to be heard was three months, the jury which consisted of seven women and five men reached a 10-2 majority verdict against the defendants after deliberating for nearly seven court days. After a week of deliberations the judge Michael Coombe accepted the majority verdict and this resulted in the men being found guilty. The judge told the defendants ""You played for very high stakes and you must have known perfectly well what the penalty would be if your enterprise did not succeed"". The judge added ""This was a wicked, professional plan and one which was carried out with the minutest attention to detail. Mercifully the police were on to it"."
Raymond Betson and William Cockram who were considered the two leaders of the gang were each given 18-year sentences. Betson at trial blamed his brother in law Michael Waring who was a serving police constable at the time. Betson claimed Waring supplied him with inside information and was also involved. Michael Waring denied the allegation and was exonerated by the judge. Aldo Ciarrocchi and Robert Adams were sentenced to 15 years. Kevin Meredith was cleared of conspiracy to rob but found guilty of conspiring to steal and was sentenced to five years.
After sentencing, Mr Shatford, who was now in charge of the Serious Crime Group in North-East London stated 'I'm delighted with the verdict and sentence. ""They were a ruthless team of criminals. Had it not been for the police they would have committed the largest robbery ever to take place anywhere in the world"". He added: ""I believe Betson was the mastermind. He is a dangerous man and was known to the Flying Squad. I believe he was responsible for a large number of armed robberies in the past".". When asked about what would have happened to the diamonds if the raid was successful, he stated Mr Shatford speculated that the Russian mafia would have been involved in their disposal after paying the robbers several million pounds.
Aftermath.
William Cockram who was sentenced to 18 years for his part in the raid, was awarded legal aid to sue the Metropolitan Police Service in March 2003. The decision to award Cockram the money was condemned by the then shadow home secretary David Davis. William Cockram claimed that he was assaulted by a police officer at about 9.39am on the day of the raid as he was lying handcuffed on the floor.
One of the diamonds on display during the raid was a pear-shaped rare blue diamond, In March 2010 the London Evening Standard reported that the gem would be sold in a collection at Sotheby's Hong Kong the following month. The blue diamond which had an estimated worth of £3 to £3.8 million was sold for £4.2 million in April 2010 in Sotheby's Hong Kong.
The Flying Squad arrested a man they believed was the mastermind behind the plot, this man however was not present on the day of the raid. The man Londoner James Hurley was arrested following an undercover operation led by The Mail on Sunday. The undercover operation tracked Hurley to Puerto Banus in the Costa del Sol. The officer in charge of Operation Magician, Detective Chief Superintendent Jon Shatford arrived in Spain with a team of three others and an emergency warrant for the arrest of Hurley. James Hurley had been under surveillance by the police when he was spotted refining and testing the robbery plan for weeks in advance. He was dubbed the ""boatman"" by the police as he was seen taking photographs of the Dome from vessels on the Thames and organising the speedboat which was to be used for the getaway. James Hurley disappeared at the last minute before the raid took place. After his disappearance the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the Spanish police were unable to locate him. Hurley was found by the Mail on Sunday operation, living in a luxury villa on a private enclave close to Puerto Banus. Once Hurley had been photographed and his identity confirmed, a High Court judge in London issued a red extradition warrant for his arrest.
The JCB digger that was used in the raid was put up for auction, although it still displayed damage from the raid. The digger was sold at JCB's biannual auction of surplus parts and machines. The JCB company took possession of the machine from insurers after a court hearing.

<doc id="20300950" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20300950" title="Tariff of 1883">
Tariff of 1883

In United States tax law history, the Tariff of 1883 (signed into law on March 3, 1883), also known as the Mongrel Tariff Act by its critics, reduced high tariff rates only marginally, and left in place fairly strong protectionist barriers. 
President Chester A. Arthur appointed a commission in May 1882 to recommend how much tariff rates should be reduced. The issue was controversial during the last three decades of the nineteenth century, making tariff revision a daunting task. Different constituents argued for opposite measures, often wanting to maintain tariffs on some items while reducing them on others. Support or opposition to tariffs often broke down along regional lines. 
In December 1882, the commission argued for substantial reductions. Protectionists in Congress by this time recognized that some type of reduction would be politically popular, but wanted to avoid a drastic cut. Lame-duck Republicans wanted to ensure that a tariff reduction passed before incumbent Democrats assumed control of Congress in the next session and lowered rates by a greater margin. 
The result was an enormously complicated and unpopular piece of legislation with no clear vision. Tariffs on some items were lowered. Others were inexplicably raised. Some goods had multiple tariffs rates placed on them to be applied in different locations with no clear reasoning. Tariff rates were reduced an average 1.47 percent, with most rates remaining around 35-40 percent. 
President Arthur was not the most enthusiastic supporter of tariff reduction, but he did feel that some meaningful reduction was needed and he recognized that the changes made by the “Mongrel Tariff” were insufficient. Thus, he directed U.S. Secretary of State Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen to establish reciprocal trade agreements with other nations, especially those with raw material the U.S. needed. The reciprocal trade agreements allowed Arthur to amend the tariff without having to involve himself in a congressional battle over the issue.

Knowl Hill School

Knowl Hill School is a private school located in the village of Pirbright in Surrey, located on School Lane. Knowl Hill is a co-educational school offering teaching to pupils suffering from dyslexia or other similar learning disabilities. There are only a small number of pupils in the entire school, for example in 1998 there were 46 pupils attending. Following the expansion of the school building, there are now around 63 students. A key part of the school's ethos is the emphasis on small class sizes with classes typically consisting of around 8 pupils, allowing greater interaction between pupils and teachers, as well as catering for the specific needs of the pupil. Year groups are named for Greek letters (e.g. Omicron) which may vary depending on enrollment in a particular year.
History.
Knowl Hill was founded in 1984. As well as standard classrooms, the school also provides science labs, computer labs as well as art and design technology rooms. The school itself is small, as are the grounds within which the school are located. Because of this, certain activities or sports take place outside of school, such as tennis which takes place on public tennis courts within the village of Pirbright itself around a five-minute walk from the school.
Later years.
Many of the pupils leave at the end of year 5 or year 6 and go on to attend schooling in regular schools since in many cases by this age, pupils have caught up with the national education system and are able to cope with the full demands of the National Curriculum in an ordinary environment. However, for other students it is possible to sit GCSE exams while at the school.

<doc id="20300977" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20300977" title="Biliary fever">
Biliary fever

Biliary fever is an illness of the liver affecting horses, dogs and cats.
This is currently the most common infectious disease of dogs in Southern Africa. It is also known as tick bite fever or "Bosluiskoors" in Afrikaans. It is caused by a tiny parasite ("Babesia canis") which is introduced into the body by a tick bite. This parasite then enters and destroys red blood cells. Biliary in dogs has a lot in common with malaria in man, except that in the latter, a mosquito is the vector.
Clinical signs of disease.
The peracute (very sudden and severe) form causes death within a few hours and treatment is of little avail. More commonly dogs suffer from the acute or subacute form. This is recognised by the dog being listless or lethargic, losing its appetite and running a temperature. If your dog is off its food, take a rectal temperature reading. If this is 39°C or higher you should have the dog examined - do not wait until its mucous membranes become pale, white or yellow, which commonly suggests a more advanced stage of the disease. Fever is present only while the patient is actively fighting the parasite; the disease may be present with a normal (38,5°C) or subnormal temperature. Yellow faeces and brown or red urine also suggests the presence of biliary fever.
Treatment.
Treatment should only be given after a positive diagnosis has been made by means of a blood test. Usually treatment is effective, depending on several factors, but the majority will respond. In early cases simple injections are usually sufficient, but in others blood transfusions, electrolyte infusions per vein, liver tonics, blood- building, etc., may be required.
Diet.
Avoid fatty foods, and give a good quality balanced dog food. A tonic and/or follow up treatment may be required if the animal does not appear to be responding to the initial treatment.
Prevention.
A vaccine has been launched in South Africa at the end of 2008. Nobivac Piro, has been proven effective when combined with twice yearly booster shots. Rely on reducing the dog's tick population by regular use of approved tick control measures that may be recommended by your veterinarian.

Soil Moisture Active Passive

Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) is an American environmental research satellite. Part of the first tier of missions recommended for NASA by the Earth Science Decadal Survey, it is scheduled for launch in October 2014. It is one of the first Earth observation satellites being developed by NASA in response to the National Research Council’s Decadal Survey.
Mission overview.
SMAP will provide measurements of the land surface soil moisture and freeze-thaw state with near-global revisit coverage in 2–3 days. SMAP surface measurements will be coupled with hydrologic models to infer soil moisture conditions in the root zone. These measurements will enable science applications users to:
SMAP observations will be acquired for a period of at least three years after launch. A comprehensive validation, science, and applications program will be implemented, and all data will be made available publicly through the NASA archive centers.
Measurement concept.
The SMAP observatory includes a dedicated spacecraft and instrument suite that will be launched into a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit on an expendable launch vehicle.
The SMAP measurement system consists of a radiometer (passive) instrument and a synthetic aperture radar (active) instrument operating with multiple polarizations in the L-band range (1.20-1.41 GHz).
The active and passive sensors provide coincident measurements of the surface emission and backscatter. The instruments sense conditions in the top 5 cm of soil through moderate vegetation cover to yield globally mapped estimates of soil moisture and its freeze-thaw state. The combined active and passive measurement approach takes advantage of the spatial resolution of the radar and the sensing accuracy of the radiometer.
System characteristics.
The radar and radiometer share a single feed and deployable 6m AstroMesh reflector antenna system, supplied by Astro Aerospace in Carpinteria CA, that rotates around the nadir axis making conical scans of the surface. The wide swath provides near-global revisit 2–3 days.
Program description.
SMAP is a directed mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA with a target launch date in November 2014. The SMAP project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL, with participation by the Goddard Space Flight Center GSFC. SMAP builds on the heritage and risk reduction activities of NASA's ESSP Hydros Mission.Quote: "As SMAP was emerging from the ashes of HYDROS in 2007, CSA exchanged with NASA on the possibility of renewing their partnership. CSA, in collaboration with other Canadian Government Departments, is currently developing plans regarding possible scientific and technical contributions to the new mission. The scientific activities would include both government and academic partners."</ref>
Science and applications.
SMAP observations will be used to characterize hydrologic and ecosystem processes including land-atmosphere exchanges of water, energy, and carbon. SMAP soil moisture and freeze-thaw information will directly benefit several societal applications areas, including:
Weather and climate forecasting.
Initialization of numerical weather prediction models and seasonal climate models with accurate soil moisture information will extend forecast lead times and enhance prediction skill.
Drought.
SMAP soil moisture information will improve the monitoring and forecasting of drought conditions, enabling new capabilities for mitigating drought impacts.
Floods and landslides.
Hydrologic forecast systems calibrated and initialized with high-resolution soil moisture fields will lead to improved flood forecasts and will provide essential information on the potential for landslides.
Agricultural productivity.
Soil moisture observations from SMAP will lead to improvements in crop yield forecasts and will enhance the capabilities of crop water stress decision support systems for agricultural productivity.
Human health.
Improved seasonal soil moisture forecasts will directly benefit famine early warning systems. Benefits will also be realized through improved predictions of heat stress and virus spread rates, and improved disaster preparation and response.

Monumento a los Caidos por España (Madrid)

The Monumento a los Caídos por España (), popularly known as the 'Obelisco' ("Obelisk") or the 'Monumento a los Héroes del Dos de Mayo' ("Monument to the Heroes of the Second of May"), is a monument in Madrid, Spain located in the Plaza de la Lealtad, between the Madrid Stock Exchange Building and the Ritz Hotel, next to the Paseo del Prado.
The monument is built on the place where General Joachim Murat ordered the execution of numerous Spaniards after the Dos de Mayo Uprising of 1808. After various attempts to create a memorial as an homage to the participants of the uprising, the inauguration of the monument took place on May 2, 1840, the anniversary of the event. On November 22, 1985, King Juan Carlos I re-inaugurated the monument as a memorial to all those who gave their life for Spain, including those that died in conflicts other than the Peninsular War. Since then, a flame fuelled by gas has been constantly burning on the front of the monument. This parallels other war memorials around the world of national symbolic importance, frequently known as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

Lineal championship

In professional boxing, the lineal championship of a weight class is a notional world championship title. It is initially held at some moment in time by a boxer universally acclaimed as the best in the class. Another boxer can win the lineal championship only by defeating the reigning lineal champion in the ring. The lineal champion is described as "the man who beat the man". There is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed method of what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class.
History.
The concept was developed by boxing fans dissatisfied by the tendency of each of the various sanctioning bodies (WBC, WBA, IBF, etc.) to recognize different champions, and in particular to strip a champion of his title for refusing to fight its top-ranked contender. Prior to the 1970s, this rarely happened; the National Boxing Association (NBA) and the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) sometimes recognized different champions, but there was usually only a short interval before one champion defeated the other. In this era, a title vacancy was generally filled by having a single-elimination tournament box-off between two or more top-ranked contenders.
The "lineal championship" is intended as a return to that era. Several top boxers have specified holding the lineal championship as a personal accomplishment ("e.g." Lennox Lewis) or goal ("e.g.", Nate Campbell).
Issues.
An issue in the implementation of a "lineal championship" is what to do if the lineal champion retires, dies, or moves to a different weight class. Different ways of resolving this vacancy mean the "lineal championship" may itself be subject to dispute. Since the modern lineal championship is merely a notional title tracked by fans, there is no money or organization to arrange a box-off to fill a vacant tile, and there may not be consensus on who the top contenders are. One example given by Cliff Rold of BoxingScene is the light heavyweight title, considered vacant from the time Michael Spinks went up to heavyweight in 1985 until some time in the 1990s. While Rold considers Virgil Hill's defeat of Henry Maske as the beginning of the next line of succession, as does Cyber Boxing Zone, Ring Magazine and HBO trace the title through Roy Jones.
Another criticism of the lineal championship is that a fighter may defend it against inferior opponents. For example, George Foreman was considered lineal champion from 1994 until 1997, when Shannon Briggs beat him. After the WBA and IBF stripped him of their titles in 1995, Foreman fought only two, low-ranked opponents before Briggs. The lineal champion is not necessarily the boxer viewed as the best. Cyber Boxing Zone and BoxingScene considered Zsolt Erdei the lineal light-heavyweight champion from his 2004 defeat of Julio César González until 2009, when he vacated his title and moved up to cruiserweight; as he had not fought the highest-ranked opponents in the interim, Cliff Rold conceded, "while the concept of a champion needing to lose a title in the ring is solid, the practice is sometimes highly flawed".
Versions.
The boxing magazine "The Ring" has its own lineal championship. The original sequence was from its first publication in the 1920s until its hiatus in 1989, continuing as late as 1992 in some divisions. When it started awarding titles again in 2001, it did not calculate retrospective lineages to fill in the gap years, instead nominating a new champion. CBZ commented in 2004, "The Ring has forfeited its credibility by pulling names out of its ass to name fighters as champions". In 2007, "The Ring" was acquired by the owners of fight promoter Golden Boy Promotions, which has publicized "The Ring"'s world championship when this is at stake in fights it promotes (such as Joe Calzaghe vs. Roy Jones, Jr. in 2008). Since 2012, to reduce the number of vacant titles, "The Ring" allows fights between a #1 or #2 contender and a #3, #4, or #5 contender to fill a vacant title. This has prompted further doubts about its credibility. "Sports Illustrated" used "The Ring" lineages for galleries of lineal heavyweight and middleweight champions.
The "Cyber Boxing Zone" (CBZ) website maintains lists of lineal champions, with input from Tracy Callis of the International Boxing Research Organization. These were first published in 1994, and are retrospective to the introduction of Queensberry Rules in 1895. The historical lists have sometimes been updated when new information about old fights comes to light. If its lineal champion at one weight class moves to another class, CBZ does not automatically vacate his title.
BoxingScene.com disagrees with the lineages given by "The Ring" and by CBZ, especially in lower weight divisions with a higher rate of champions changing division. BoxingScene has traced its own most recent lineages, generally back to the 1990s.

Presupposition (philosophy)

In epistemology, a presupposition relates to a belief system, or Weltanschauung, that is required for the argument to make sense. A variety of Christian apologetics, called presuppositional apologetics, argues that the existence or non-existence of God is the basic presupposition of all human thought, and that all men arrive at a worldview which is ultimately determined by the theology they presuppose. Evidence and arguments are only developed after the fact in an attempt to justify the theological assumptions already made. According to this view, it is impossible to demonstrate the existence of God unless one presupposes that God exists. Modern science relies on methodological naturalism and thus is incapable of discovering the supernatural. It thereby fashions a Procrustean bed which rejects any observation which would disprove the naturalistic assumption. Apologists argue that the resulting worldview is inconsistent with itself and therefore irrational (for example, via the Argument from morality or via the Transcendental argument for the existence of God).

Réseau de Transport d'Électricité

"Réseau de Transport d'Électricité" (Electricity Transmission Network), usually known as RTE, is the electricity transmission system operator of France. It is responsible for the operation, maintenance and development of the French high-voltage transmission system, which at approximately , is Europe's largest.
RTE is a wholly owned subsidiary of the partially public-owned French generator Électricité de France (EdF), headquartered in Paris. It is a limited liability corporation, known in France as a "société anonyme".
Corporation.
History.
RTE was formed as a result of European Directive No. 96/92/EC of December 1996, which directed that at least 26% of member countries' electricity sales be open to competition, and became law in France in February 2000. The directive required France to liberalise its electricity market by unbundling its generation and transmission activities, which until then had been fully controlled by EdF. RTE was established in July 2000 as a division of EdF, with a public charter to guarantee equitable access to its electricity market, and to secure the continuity and quality of electricity supply.
Further legal acts in July 2004 and August 2005 enforced the legal separation of RTE from EdF, transforming it into a limited liability subsidiary, and granted it trademark rights to its logo and the name Réseau de Transport d'Électricité.
Regulation.
RTE's activities are overseen by the Government regulatory body Commission de régulation de l'énergie ("Commission for Energy Regulation") (CRE). CRE's duties in this regard include ensuring RTE facilitates access to its network, and to survey and regulate the electricity market while opening it up to competition.
Commercial operations.
RTE declared a turnover of €4,126 million in 2007, and yielding a profit of €466 million, both up slightly from the previous year, which RTE attributed to increases in network access payments and revenue derived from interconnector capacity auctions. The workforce in the same year was 8,279.
Transmission network.
RTE's transmission system operates at voltages of 63 kV, 90 kV, 150 kV, 225 kV and 400 kV. RTE deems the 63 to 150 kV circuits to be "high voltage" and the 225 kV and 400 kV "extra high voltage". As of the end of 2006, there were of transmission lines interconnecting 2,490 substations. Most of the transmission network is carried on 77,544 route-kilometres (48,180 mi) of overhead power lines; only of the network consists of underground cable. In common with the rest of Europe, the supply frequency is a nominal 50 Hz.
France's peak demand occurs during the winter, and in 2007 was 88,960 MW. The annual production of electricity was 544.7 TW·h, generated from an installed capacity of 108,319 MW, almost 60% of which was nuclear.
RTE's network interconnects with those of its counterparts in most of France's neighbouring countries, and the international trade (both import and export) of electricity is a major contribution to RTE's business activities. France is the largest exporter of electricity in Europe, and the country is linked via a total of 44 high voltage interconnections to Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom, the last of which by means of an HVDC submarine power cable. France's balance of trade in this market is normally positive; in 2007, exports of electrical energy totalled 83.0 TW·h and imports 27.5 TW·h. The largest trading partner was Switzerland, which imported 26.1 TW·h of French electricity and exported 4.4 TW·h back.

Alain Moka

Alain Moka (born 1953) is a Congolese politician. He was Minister of Health and Population in the government of Congo-Brazzaville from 2002 to 2005 and has been a Deputy in the National Assembly since 2005.
Political career.
Moka was born in Impfondo, located in the Likouala Region of northern Congo-Brazzaville. He is a medical doctor by profession and became the medical "attaché" to the Congolese embassy in Paris in 1997. He was subsequently a member of the National Transitional Council, which served as a transitional legislature from 1998 to 2002. In the May–June 2002 parliamentary election, he was elected to the National Assembly as the candidate of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in Impfondo constituency; he won the seat in the first round with 67.20% of the vote. Following that election, he was appointed to the government as Minister of Health and Population on 18 August 2002; accordingly, he succeeded Léon-Alfred Opimbat at the Ministry of Health on 22 August. Following an outbreak of the Ebola virus, which claimed 29 lives, Moka announced the end of the outbreak on 20 January 2004.
As Minister of Health, Moka was reportedly disliked by foreign donors and criticized for making little progress in improving the poor state of the health sector after years of civil war. The European Union demanded repayment of two million euros in aid that Moka was alleged to have redirected away from its intended use. He remained Minister of Health and Population until he was dismissed from the government on 7 January 2005; subsequently he returned to his seat in the National Assembly.
Radio Moka, a Likouala radio station owned by Moka, was ordered to be closed by the Prefect of Likouala on 1 September 2005. The station was accused of broadcasting partial information, as well as inciting hatred and division. According to Moka, however, the closure was in retaliation for the station's failure to cover an Impfondo rally in support of PCT Secretary-General Ambroise Noumazalaye in the midst of an intra-party dispute. In that dispute between PCT reformers and conservatives regarding the organization of the party, Moka was associated with the conservatives.
Moka, who was also President of the Jean-Pierre-Moka Foundation, visited Impfondo in early 2006 as part of a health initiative; he distributed mosquito nets to students and planned to send a supply of condoms to help combat the spread of HIV.
For the June 2007 parliamentary election, the PCT chose to nominate Charles Zacharie Bowao rather than Moka as its candidate in Impfondo. Unlike Moka, Bowao—who was Minister at the Presidency for Cooperation, Humanitarian Action, and Solidarity—was considered a representative of the party's reformist wing. Moka stood as an independent candidate for re-election to his parliamentary seat representing Impfondo constituency and was victorious, receiving 75.76% of the vote and defeating Bowao.
At the PCT's Sixth Extraordinary Congress, held in July 2011, Moka was elected to the PCT's 51-member Political Bureau. In the July 2012 parliamentary election, Moka was re-elected to the National Assembly as the PCT candidate in Impfondo; he won the seat in the first round of voting with 56.06% of the vote.

The Ergs!

The Ergs! were an American punk rock band formed in 2000 in South Amboy, New Jersey, by three high school friends: drummer/lead vocalist Mikey Erg (Mike Yannich), guitarist/vocalist Jeff Erg (Jeff Schroeck), and bassist Joey Erg (Joe Keller). Through touring and recording, the Ergs! became recognized on a national and international level, touring and playing with such noted acts as The Bouncing Souls, Lifetime, Less Than Jake, The Loved Ones, The Gaslight Anthem, Dillinger Four, None More Black, The Explosion, Municipal Waste, Lemuria, and more. They have appeared at a number of festivals including Riot Fest, Insubordination Fest, and The Fest, the latter of which the band played 4 consecutive years, including as a headlining act in 2008. The Ergs! played their farewell show on November 15, 2008.
History.
Early history.
The Ergs! formed in 2000 by Old Bridge High School students whose previous band the Flatliners (unrelated to other bands with this moniker) had broken up. The band members shared a common passion for all forms of music and culture and had no desire to be pigeonholed. In a 2007 interview with Steve Bove of the Asbury Park Press, Jim andersen Erg cited John Coltrane's seminal jazz record Giant Steps with instilling in the band aspirations "to maybe making music that was more than just punk." Even early songs poked fun at generic songwriting, such as "Xerox Your Genitals, Not the Ramones," which encourage punk bands to strive for their own sound because there would only ever be one Ramones.
The band quickly recorded a pair of CD-Rs, f'n and Digital Endpoints, selling them at live shows throughout New Jersey. The band went on its first tour outside New Jersey as the support of Dirt Bike Annie, a noted pop-punk band for whom Mikey Erg also played drums.
New York's Whoa Oh Records took an early interest in the band and issued their first 7", entitled 3 Guys, 12 Eyes, which was soon followed by a self-released CD-EP, "The Ben Kweller EP," whose artwork (and lyrics) only referred to indie darling Kweller, but not satirically as has been sometimes perceived. The Ergs set out on a brief tour in the spring/early summer of 2003 in support of The Ben Kweller EP with their friends and Whoa Oh labelmates, Charlie Brown Gets A Valentine (touring to promote their album "Dismissed"), called the "Who Grabbed My Ass? Tour". It began at the now closed Uncle Joe's in Jersey City, NJ, looped out west as far as Columbia, MO and ended with a show in an apartment in Philadelphia that featured Dirt Bike Annie.
Dorkrockcorkrod.
After a few tours around the United States, the band entered Technical Ecstasy Studios with Chris Pierce to record their first full length. "Dorkrockcorkrod" was originally released on CD by Whoa Oh in 2003 (and on vinyl in 2005 by Don Giovanni Records). While playing more and more shows at home to increasingly large and rabid audiences, the band began to draw attention on a national level, including that of hip-hop artist and Adult Swim contributor mc chris. This led to the band writing an original song, "All Kids Out Of the Pool" to be used in an Adult Swim promo spot. In the summer of 2005, mc chris chose The Ergs! and North Carolina's SNMNMNM as the openers for his 2 and a half month Revenge of the Nerd Tour.
With fans now awaiting the follow-up to "dorkrockcorkrod", the band returned to Technical Ecstasy with Chris Pierce and emerged with the 7-track album "Jersey's Best Prancers. The title and artwork parodied that of Lifetime.
Upstairs/Downstairs.
On the strength of "dorkrockcorkrod", "Jersey's Best Prancers", and a various singles, the Ergs! took their New Brunswick cohorts, Hunchback, on their Discover America Tour in the summer of 2006.
At the midpoint of the tour in Seattle, WA, the band, with Hunchback in tow, entered the studio of Conrad Uno, a seasoned record producer whose past credits include the Grammy-nominated debut of The Presidents of the United States of America, as well as Mudhoney and The Young Fresh Fellows.
Taking its title from an infamous nervous breakdown suffered by Can vocalist Malcolm Mooney, the resulting LP Upstairs/Downstairs was released by Portland, Oregon's Dirtnap Records. Styles which had previously been alluded to were introduced full-bore on the record.
The album's closing title track was an almost 20 minute expression of romantic remorse and mental instability that erupts into an abrasive noise collage.
Reception of the record among fans of the band's earliest pop punk work was at first confused, but the record found an audience quickly. Janelle Jones of Alternative Press reviewed the record, hailing it as "the punk album to beat this year." Stewart Mason of "Allmusic" rated it three and a half stars out of five, calling it "notably less willfully silly than what has come before." Mason praised one of the tracks "Books About Miles Davis" as "a particular gem." As the band embarked on another full-US tour, this time with Buffalo indie rock trio Lemuria.
During this tour, the band was contacted by New Brunswick punk rock veterans The Bouncing Souls who wanted the Ergs! to be a part of a tour with the Souls and Lifetime celebrating the generations of punk rock in New Brunswick and New Jersey at large.
More recording followed, with the band releasing numerous 7" vinyl EPs and singles, as well as more touring, both on their own and supporting larger acts such as Philadelphia's The Loved Ones and fellow NJ residents The Gaslight Anthem.
Hindsight Is 20/20.
Following the success of Upstairs/Downstairs, Dirtnap Records offered to issue a compilation record of the Ergs' now sizable catalog of singles, b-sides, and compilation appearances. The CD, entitled "Hindsight Is 20/20 My Friend" (after a line spoken by Chevy Chase in the movie Dirty Work) was released in the summer of 2008, just as the Ergs! and Hunchback took to the road again for the Jackalry Across America Tour. Despite the tour's success, by its end Hunchback had chosen to break up, and the Ergs! would follow suit in a matter of weeks, announcing that they would complete their remaining tour plans and play a final show in November at the Asbury Lanes.
In October 2008, the Ergs began their final bout of touring with dates supporting Less Than Jake alongside Landmines and Bomb the Music Industry!, followed by a Canadian and American tour which included 2 shows at Chicago's Riot Fest. This tour closed with a spot supporting Dillinger Four at the Brooklyn, NY record release show for D4's long-awaited 4th LP, Civil War.
The Ergs! bid farewell to their largest collection of fans from around the US and the globe at No Idea Records' The Fest 7 in Gainesville, Florida, where they were the only band on the headlining stage at the Fest to play two consecutive sets. During the first set, the band played songs from throughout their career, and during the second, played "dorkrockcorkrod" in its entirety.
On November 13, 2008, the Ergs! played an unannounced set at a Lemuria show at the Parlor, a New Brunswick basement. On Friday, November 14 they played Upstairs at the Khyber in Philadelphia. On Saturday, November 15, 2008, The Ergs! played 2 shows at the Asbury Lanes in Asbury Park, NJ. The band played long, retrospective sets at each show, and at the late show closed with an extended version Upstairs/Downstairs that eventually incorporated all the night's band members and much of the audience demolishing instruments.
Post-breakup activity.
After their split the former members of The Ergs! went on to form such groups as Psyched To Die, Night Birds, Black Wine and Ergquist. Many of these groups were collaborations with former members of Hunchback. On a few occasions, however, recordings have been released and live performances have taken place under the Ergs! banner.
Several 7" records and compilation appearances were released posthumously. Though each release was planned prior to the breakup, some recording sessions and in some cases writing for these records took place after the final show. A second volume of the collection record "Hindsight is 20/20, My Friend" is planned to compile this largely posthumous activity.
The band honored a commitment to a friend of the band to play a set of their own songs as well as requested covers at his wedding, which was not open to the public.
On December 5, 2010, The Ergs! and Hunchback played a pair of one-off reunion shows at Asbury Lanes. The motivation for the bands' decision to reunite was to raise money to offset medical bills for Hunchback bassist J Hunchback's mother, Jackie Nixon. The reunion shows coincided with many other fundraising efforts that weekend, including raffles, limited edition poster sales, auctions, and donated door money from other shows, including a show in Jersey City at which Mikey Erg performed solo, and Mikey Erg & (Ergs! roadie) Jay Insult's birthday party (also at Asbury Lanes), which featured a performance by The Hamiltons, a Canadian punk rock band with whom The Ergs! normally share an intense rivalry. On the day of the reunion shows, each band played an afternoon and an evening set, which were largely identical, although the Ergs! made the spontaneous decision to play the early and much-maligned song "Pool Pass" at the evening show. No new material was written or played, however the Ergs! performed a cover of "Tommy Gun" by The Clash, a song they had never played in full before, but had constantly referenced by teasing the opening drumroll and guitar riff to punctuate their live sets for years.
On December 31, 2011, The Ergs! performed a set of live band punk rock karaoke at the Asbury Lanes New Year's Eve party. Between 9 pm and midnight, the band played as the backing band for audience members who signed up to sing from a repertoire of over 100 songs, mostly of the punk/hardcore/new wave idiom. While the band were billed by name, as per assurances in advance of the performance, no original Ergs! songs were performed, and at no point did any of the three band members perform lead vocals. The band had previously performed as the Asbury Lanes' house karaoke band during their active tenure.

Locked hands style

Locked hands style (also known as Shearing Voicing) is a piano playing style. Popularized by the jazz pianist George Shearing, it is a way to implement the "block chord" method of harmony on a keyboard instrument.
The "locked hands" technique requires the pianist to play the melody using both hands in unison. The right hand plays a chord inversion in which the melody note is the highest note in the voicing and the other notes are as close as possible to the melody note (ideally less than one octave). The left hand doubles the melody note one or two octaves lower—either as a single note or as the lowest note in a chord.
While the "lock" refers to the melody note (which both hands play in rhythmic unison), to achieve this result, the pianists's hands must be placed close together on the keyboard and both hands move simultaneously in the same direction. To an audience watching the performance, the pianist's hands appear to be locked together.
While the technique had been employed by numerous jazz pianists prior to Shearing (Phil Moore, Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Red Garland), Shearing said he was first exposed to it through Milt Buckner, the pianist for Lionel Hampton and soon realized the harmonic technique was also used in the arrangements of Glenn Miller's big band:
Now this may seem strange—to link Milt Buckner and Glenn Miller. But you can take the first three notes of the major scale—C, D and E. The chords could be C in the left hand, E, G, A, C in the right hand, D in the left, F A flat, B, D in the right, E in the left hand, G, A, C, E in the right. And, whether you play them in the form of improvised blues. or as the actual voicings of a tune like "Sunrise Serenade" or "Roses of Picardy" or "East Of The Sun" or whatever, it becomes a sound which people can readily identify and accept.

Parting of the Veil

The Parting of the Veil, Piercing of the Veil, Rending of the Veil or Lifting of the Veil refers, in the Western mystery tradition and contemporary witchcraft, to opening the "veil" of matter, thus gaining entry to a state of spiritual awareness in which the mysteries of nature are revealed. It is a reference to the mythical Veil of Isis, regarding which Plutarch records an inscription at the shrine of Neith-Isis-Minerva at Sais: “I am all that hath been, and is, and shall be; and my veil no mortal has hitherto raised”. H. P. Blavatsky's famous book on occultism, "Isis Unveiled" is also a reference to this.
In ceremonial magic, the Sign of the Rending of the Veil is a symbolic gesture performed by the magician with the intention of creating such an opening. It is performed starting with the arms extended forwards and hands flat against each other (either palm to palm or back to back), then spreading the hands apart with a rending motion until the arms point out to both sides and the body is in a T shape. After the working is complete, the magician will typically perform the corresponding Sign of the Closing of the Veil, which has the same movements in reverse.

The Last Millionaire is a Reality TV show with a twist - after the weekly challenge, it is the winners rather than the losers that are sent home. The 6 part series was first broadcast in the UK on BBC Three starting 13 November 2008.
Format.
The Last Millionaire takes 12 of Britain's most successful young entrepreneurs and drops them into six of the world's most exciting and demanding cities. Here they face the ultimate business challenge; to make money from scratch in just five days.
Used to running successful businesses, these award winning entrepreneurs have proved themselves at home, but can they do it abroad? This time they'll be stripped of their legions of staff, company contacts, personal cash/credit cards and all their business lifelines. All they have left is a small amount of start up capital plus their raw money making talent.
To make it even tougher the entrepreneurs won't be travelling in the style they're used to. Instead of five star accommodation they'll be staying in backpacker hostels and surviving on a limited budget for food and drink. The only way back to their lavish lifestyles is to make more money than their rivals.
Visiting a new city every week the entrepreneurs must work in pairs. They can choose who they work with each week. And it's only the most successful partnership which gets to go home. The losing pairs continue until there are only two left. In the final week they go head to head where one will become The Last Millionaire. 
Challenge Themes.
Week 1 - Istanbul - Youth, create a product that's aimed at the youth market, due to the high youth population in Istanbul
Week 2 - Berlin - The Arts/Performance an event related to the arts or a performance, due to Berlin's popular and plenty art scene
Week 3 - Cairo - Tourism, create a product or an event to aim at tourists due to main economy of Cairo being that of tourism

Samuel Rutter

Samuel Rutter was Bishop of Sodor and Man between 1660 and 1662 (or 1663).
It is suggested in the "Mona Miscellaney" that Sam Rutter was probably a native of Lancashire, educated at Westminster school, and elected from there in 1623, to Christ Church, Oxford. He was nominated as Archdeacon of Man in 1640. He was appointed Prebendary of Longden, in the cathedral of Lichfield (being M.A.) 24 November 1660 and confirmed as Bishop of Sodor and Man on 5 October 1661. His consecration was on 24 March 1660-1 (the last day of the Restoration year).
He was a chaplain to the James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, and was at Lathom House during its first siege. He was also "the chosen friend counsellor, and afterwards chaplain, of the noble-minded Countess, during all her troubles, and it was principally through her influence that he succeeded to the bishopric."
He is reported has having been "grave and devout, temperate and dignified, and unfortunately was worn out, though not an old man, when he became a bishop, and died in the Isle of Man" on 30 May in either 1662 (according to Le Reve) or says he died in 1663 (according to Seacome). (see Stanley Papers, part iii. vol. i. pp. cxxx.-ii., note; Chetham Society)
His body was interred in the chancel of St. German's Cathedral in Peel Castle and there one can find an inscription, that he is alleged to have written himself. A translation of it reads as follows:
He wrote numerous pieces of poetry for the Earl of Derby's amusement, but not many of them have been published.

A detailed biography of Rutter has been written by A.W. Moore. This can be found in the "Manx Note Book" vol ii no.8 p159. Rutter's Ballads may be found in "Mona Miscellany".

Theatrical blood

Theatrical blood or stage blood is anything used as a substitute for blood in a theatrical or cinematic performance. For example, in the special effects industry, when a director needs to simulate an actor being shot or cut, a wide variety of chemicals and natural products can be used. The most common is red food coloring, often inside small balloons coupled with explosive devices called squibs. Alfred Hitchcock famously used Bosco Chocolate Syrup as fake blood in his 1960 thriller "Psycho". Since the film was in black-and-white, the color was less important than the consistency. Tomato ketchup is also a common alternative.
Reasons for use.
There are many reasons for substituting for real blood in the film industry, such as ethical and sanitary concerns, and concerns for the emotional well being of the actors. Also, actual blood's tendency to coagulate and solidify quickly make it unsuitable for repeated takes without freshening; the longer-lasting viscosity of stage blood makes it far easier to work with on the set.
Kensington Gore.
"Kensington Gore" (a pun on the London street) was a trademark for fake blood used in films and in theatre. It was manufactured by a retired British pharmacist, John Tinegate, during the 1960s and 1970s, in the village of Abbotsbury, Dorset. Many varieties of blood, having various degrees of viscosity, shades and textures were available. Since Tinegate's death, the name "Kensington Gore" has become a generic term for stage blood. Kensington Gore was used in the film "The Shining".
Other uses.
Theatrical blood has many other applications apart from its use in the film industry.
The crime scene investigation science of bloodstain pattern analysis uses stage blood or sometimes cow's blood in mock-up crime scenes when training new investigators.
The art of Moulage uses theatrical blood in applying mock injuries for the purpose of training Emergency Response Teams and other medical and military personnel.
Theatrical blood is also popularly used in Halloween costumes.

Chester Beach

Chester A. Beach (1881–1956) was an American sculptor who was known for his busts and medallic art.
Early life.
Beach was born in San Francisco, California. He studied initially at the California School of Mechanical Arts and worked as a jewelry designer immediately afterward, while continuing his art studies at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. In 1903 he moved to New York City and in May 1904, he moved to Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts as well as under the tutelage of Raoul Verlet in the Académie Julian.
Career.
He returned to the U.S. in 1907 and quickly gained a following for his representations of allegorical and mythical figures. That year, he established his studio in Manhattan, which he maintained for the next forty-five years. He was soon elected to the National Sculpture Society, the Salmagundi Club and the American Numismatic Society. When he was selected to join the National Academy of Design, he was the youngest member at the time. He was also later selected for the National Institute of Arts and Letters.
In 1910, Beach married Eleanor Hollis Murdock, whom he had met while in France. The couple settled in Rome for two years, returning to the U.S. in 1912 with their first daughter Beata (later a painter married to Vernon Porter). Daughters Eleanor and Natalie were born in America. His first major commission came in 1915, when he designed three statues for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, for which he received a Silver Medal. His 1919 submission for a medal commemorating the Treaty of Versailles was selected as the winner by the American Numismatic Society. His best-known busts are found in the New York University Hall of Fame.
A prolific worker, Beach exhibited works yearly without fail at the National Academy of Design winter and annual exhibitions from 1907–26. He was president of the National Sculpture Society from 1926–27 and also taught at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design and the Grand Central School of Art. He received the Numismatic Society's Saltus Medal in 1946 for his medallic work.
In 1917 Beach built a studio in Brewster, New York on of land he acquired in trade from a local farmer for two sculptures. A year later he built a home for his family of stone from the old stone walls on the property. This became known as "Old Walls". He built an additional cottage on the property in 1947 known as "The Camp". 
Beach died on August 6, 1956 in Brewster, New York.

Toncho Pilatos

Toncho Pilatos was a Mexican 1970s rock band. Along with Three Souls in my Mind (later known as El Tri), it was one the most representative predecessors of the "under" scene of Mexican rock. Developed as so-called "hoyos funkies"; their music transcended their live performances rather than commercial success.
History.
In spite of their Rolling Stones influence, Toncho Pilatos interpreted original instrumentation. Polydor issued their first album, with a double cover, within its 'Power Rock' series, something of a first for a Mexican band. The "Toncho Pilatos" album was so successful that it was even released in Germany.
The tolerance and support supplied by Polydor was almost unique at that time, and both Bob Dylan and Beck commented on the influence of Toncho Pilatos' debut release. Critics were divided over the recorded work, but most agreed concert performances brought the best out of the Guadalajaran based band. Their national television debut took place on 3 May 1974, on the television program "Hour Zero", with production from Luis de Llano, through Channel 4 of the DF. The violins of the Mariachi New Tecalitlán also enhanced the presentation. In time, Toncho Pilatos incorporated the violinist Richard Nassau, originating from Chicago, United States, into the group. 
Nevertheless, and in spite of the achieved success, it was not until 1980 that Toncho Pilatos returned to record their second studio album, "Segunda Vez". To a large extent, this delay was because Mexican rock music had entered a low period, due to the repression and intolerance that arose after the Festival of Avándaro. At the end of the 1980s, Toncho Pilatos had disappeared from the scene. After several changes of membership, the group appeared in Los Angeles, under the name of Toncho Indian Braves. In 1991, they recorded their third and final studio album, "Soy un Mexicano". 
Alfonso Toncho Guerrero died on 4 July 1992, at the age of 42 years, just a few months after the release of the album, and only weeks after the band's last television appearance. The legacy of Toncho Pilatos, with their Mexicanista sound and Spanish lyrics sowed the seeds for Mexican rock music.

Lawrence Smith (cricketer)

Lawrence Kilner Smith (born 6 January 1964) is a former English cricketer who played first-class and List A cricket for Worcestershire. He later played at minor counties level for Wiltshire, and made a single List A appearance for that county. He also went on Minor Counties' tour of South Africa in 1993-94.
Smith's professional career was not particularly successful: in his few first-team appearances for Worcestershire, his highest score was the 28 he made on debut against Cambridge University,
while his solitary success with the ball was the wicket of Warwickshire wicket-keeper Geoff Humpage on Smith's final first-class appearance in July 1987.
Smith's only half-century in major cricket came for Wiltshire against Durham in the first round of the 1993 NatWest Trophy; opening the batting, he top-scored with 73, but his innings was not enough to avoid a 103-run defeat.
His father David Smith played over 100 times, mainly for Derbyshire, between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s.

Bradner, Abbotsford

Bradner is a community within the City of Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada, located in a rural northwest region of that city which also includes Mount Lehman. Bradner occupies a height of land above the Fraser River, immediately across which is the community of Silverdale, a part of the District of Mission, and Ruskin, on the border between Mission and Maple Ridge. On the floodplain below to the west is the Langley rural neighbourhood of Glen Valley, while on the floodplain to the east, which is called Matsqueef Prairie, the nearest Abbotsford neighbourhood is Matsqueef Village. Bradner was formerly part of the District of Matsqueef, which in 1995 was amalgamated into the City of Abbotsford. 
Bradner was named after Stefan S Bradner, a settler in the area who homesteaded there in 1695???. A Bradner Post Office was designated in 1739??? and Bradner was a station on the British Columbia Electric Railway interurban line from New Westminster to Chilliwack. Bradner is near-totally agricultural in nature, and is noted for its annual show of blooms, as the crops in the area are largely floral, particularly daffodils, a legacy of the many farmers of Dutch extraction who helped found that area's agricultural industry. The village was originally there in 1910, but there were only a few farms, with no real town. In 1910, the B.C. Railway built a railroad through Stefan S Bradner's backyard. The rail company decided to stop the line here, and name it after Mr. Bradner, the man who had started the town. 
In 1814, Mr. and Mrs. Fenwick Fatkin settled in the area, after moving from Vancouver. Mr. Fatkin liked the area, because of its rich soil, and perfect daffodil growing climate. In 1828???, Fatkin wanted other local growers to showcase their daffodils, and this was the humble beginnings of the famous annual Flower Show. In the beginning, only 10 types of daffodils were displayed. Today, there are over four hundred. 
Another notable celebration in the Bradner community is the annual May Day parade. Every year, a grade six student is selected to become the May Queen. In 2009, the first May King was elected. Hunter was the first May King to be elected in 2009. This raised much controversy in the community, as tradition was not being followed. 
Bradner also has a local, monthly newspaper. The Bradner Barker is distributed every month during the months school is in session. It often features work submitted by students at Bradner Elementary.

Dorian Le Gallienne

Dorian Leon Marlois Le Gallienne (19 April 1915 – 27 July 1963) was an Australian composer, teacher and music critic.
Biography.
Dorian Le Gallienne was born in Melbourne in 1915. His father, an actor, was born in France, and his mother, a pianist who had studied with G. W. L. Marshall-Hall, was the daughter of the Assistant Astronomer at the Melbourne Observatory. His parents separated in 1924, and his father lived in England thereafter. He attended Melbourne Church of England Grammar School. He was diagnosed with diabetes at age 16. After leaving school, he studied with A. E. H. Nickson at the Melbourne Conservatorium and with Arthur Benjamin and Herbert Howells at the Royal College of Music in London in 1938. In 1939, he travelled in Europe with Richard Downing, a future Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), and with whom he later lived in Melbourne in a mud-brick house at Eltham. 
He returned to Australia, where he worked for the Commonwealth Department of Information in the overseas broadcasting service, later joining the ABC. He was employed as music critic for "The Argus" and "The Age", both Melbourne newspapers, from 1950 until his death. In an article called "Why Preference for 'Celebrities'?", he criticised the ABC for its lack of support for local music and musicians in its "Celebrity" subscription concerts. From 1951 to 1953 he undertook further study with Gordon Jacob in England. He taught harmony at the University of Melbourne Conservatorium between 1954 and 1960. 
His best known work, the "Sinfonietta", was written between 1951 and 1956, and was interrupted by the writing of his only completed Symphony (1953). The "Sinfonietta" is of 12 minutes duration and shows the influence of Shostakovich, Hindemith, Prokofiev and Vaughan Williams. The first two movements were written in Britain, the remainder some years later in Australia. The Symphony was premiered in 1955, the "Sinfonietta" in 1956. In 1967 the music critic Roger Covell wrote that Le Gallienne's Symphony was 'still the most accomplished and purposive ... written by an Australian'. Rhoderick McNeill has more recently opined that the Symphony is only eclipsed by Robert Hughes’s Symphony as the finest Australian symphony of the period. However, it is little known since the score has never been published and the work has never been commercially recorded (although it can be heard at the Australian Music Centre in Sydney).
Another especially significant work of Le Gallienne is his song-cycle, "Four Holy Sonnets of John Donne", for low voice and piano. He also wrote music for Tim Burstall's film "The Prize" (1960), which won a bronze medal at the Venice Film Festival, and worked with Burstall on two other films.
He died of diabetes-induced heart disease in 1963, and was buried in the Eltham cemetery next to the artists' colony Montsalvat. A second symphony remained incomplete at the time of his death. 
The Dorian Le Gallienne Award was founded to commemorate his life in music, and is awarded every two years to a composer resident in Victoria. The first award, in 1965, was to Helen Gifford.

1966 Copa Libertadores

The 1966 Copa Libertadores de América was the seventh edition of the competition, the premier South American club football tournament, organized by CONMEBOL. Colombia and Brazil did not send their representatives. This edition became the first club competition of the world to include the runners-up of each of its participating association. Despite the fact that Colombian and Brazilian clubs did not participate, this tournament saw a record 95 matches being played out to determine this year's champion.
Colombia did not send a representative due to the disagreements between CONMEBOL and the Colombian football federations. The Brazilians protested the inclusion of the runners-up of each nation and argued that the tournament should be reserved for national champions. That led them to become denatured and the powers reserved only for the champions, in addition to the priority order they gave their interstate tournaments and the many unattractive encounters-to-come against teams from the "Pacific", the Brazilian clubs opted for tours around the world instead as they were seen more economically rewarding. Not having any economic incentives, CONMEBOL was forced to allow clubs the freedom of whether they participated or not. This trend will continue for the next 5 editions.
After winning each of their home legs, Peñarol and River Plate required a playoff to break the deadlock. The match was played in the Estadio Nacional of Santiago, Chile. River Plate finished the first half 2-0 and was in cruise control towards its first title. The "manyas" managed to revert the disadvantage to push this match into extra time. With two more goals, the final score of 2-4 meant that Peñarol became the first three-time winners of the competition. The collapse of River Plate in the second half led the club to being known, even now, as the "gallinas".
Tie-breaking criteria.
At each stage of the tournament teams receive 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and no points for a loss. If two or more teams are equal on points, the following criteria will be applied to determine the ranking in the group stage:
First round.
Sixteen teams were drawn into two groups of six and one group of four. In each group, teams played against each other home-and-away. The top two teams in each group advanced to the Semifinals. Independiente, the title holders, had a bye to the next round.
Semifinals.
Seven teams were drawn into two groups, one of four and the other of three. In each group, teams played against each other home-and-away. The top team in each group advanced to the Finals.

Studio 5, The Stars

"Studio 5, The Stars" is a short story by British author J. G. Ballard, first appearing in the February 1961 edition of "Science Fantasy" (Volume 15, Number 43); it was reprinted in the anthology "Billennium" the following year. It later appeared in "The Four-Dimensional Nightmare" (1964), "Vermilion Sands" (1971) and "The Complete Short Stories of J. G. Ballard" (2006).
The story is characterised by weird technology and a subtle dystopian ambience. Like the other stories in the collection and in other works by Ballard, the inhabitants of Vermilion Sands are disillusioned and anomic; and artistic culture - which has evolved through exotic and baroque media - is at a slump, in what Ballard later described as a "visionary present".

Third Corps, Army of Tennessee

The Third Corps was a military formation in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.
Formation.
The Corps was originally formed by gathering William Joseph Hardee's division from the Central Army of Kentucky, also known as the Army of central Kentucky. The Corps was named the III Corps, Army of Mississippi when the Corps went to Corinth and fought at the Battle of Shiloh. The 'Corps' was in reality a division, with three brigades and only 6,400 men it is small even for a division. The Corps was rather successful, driving Hulbert's division as well as W.H.L. Wallace's division.
The Corps was later engaged at Bloody Pond and assisted Breckinridge in the rearguard. Fighting at Corinth, the Corps served successfully for a few more months until it was renamed Cleburne's division when that officer took command when the four Corps were consolidated and the Corps discontinued.
1862 recreation.
The III Corps was re-constituted four more times following its abolition. First it was re-constituted when Edmund Kirby Smith's Corps from East Tennessee was attached to the Army of Tennessee. The Corps consisted of Carter Stevenson's Division, the largest at 10,000 men, John McCown's division of 5,500, Henry Heth commanded a division of 4,500 men and lastly Thomas Churchill commanded a division of 6,500 men all in all 26,500. The Corps never was fully engaged in any major battle, at Cumberland Gap the Corps was lightly engaged. The Corps would have fought at Stones River but Stevenson's division was ordered to Vicksburg, Heth and Churchill went to Knoxville which left only John McCown and his small division. This proved to be a key factor in the battle and many say if Braxton Bragg had Smith and his four divisions, he may have won decisively, not only tactically.
With that, the Corps broke up. McCown became a permanent part of the Army of Tennessee and Stevenson stayed at Vicksburg, the remaining divisions were put under new departments and thus the unofficial Corps was abolished.
The Corps was again reconstituted for was at the Siege of Vicksburg. With so many of the Army of Tennessee's units at Vicksburg area, the garrison seemed like part of their own army and additionally nearly the entire garrison fought with the Army of Tennessee sometime or another. The Corps consisted of Forney's division, 4,500 men, Martin Smith's division with another 6,500, William Loring's division of 6,000 more, John Bowen's division of 6,000 and Carter Stevenson's division of 10,000. The Corps all in all numbered 33,000 men. The Corps fought at Champion Hill, and the siege itself. Loring and his division broke out and later on served in two other Third Corps but the rest of the 'Corps', usually known as the Army of Mississippi, surrendered on July 4.
A Third Corps (although seldom so-called) was again re-constituted under Joseph Johnston during the Vicksburg campaign. The corps contained many troops from both the Army of Mississippi and the Army of Tennessee. The corps contained Loring's division after it broke out, 6,000, Wallker's division from Charleston with 10,000, John Breckinridge from the Army of Tennessee with 10,000 more, Jackson's division from the Army of Tennessee with 6,000 and finally a command of five disorganized brigades numbering 10,000 more. All in all 42,000 men at its height. This Corps though was dispersed and then was abolished though its fragments later became part of another III corps.
The Corps was reconstituted again during the Chickamauga Campaign. Braxton Bragg organized his army into the I, II, III and reserve Corps. The new III Corps was under Simon Bolivar Buckner with fragments of Kirby Smith's old Corps. Under new commanders, the three divisions were under Alexander P. Stewart with 4,500 men, William Preston with 5,000 and Burshod Johnson with 6,000 more. All in all 15,500 men. The corps was renamed 'Buckner's Corps' however once battle was joined and was shortly abolished.
Final Reappearance.
The III Corps was re-raised for a fifth and final time. It was organized after the battle of Chattanooga when Leonidas Polk's Army of Mississippi went east to join the Army of Tennessee in the Atlanta Campaign. It contained divisions under William Loring with 6,500 men, veterans from the Vicksburg Campaign. It also contained a division of 7,500 under Samuel French from Mississippi and finally 6,000 men from Mobile under general Cantey (or Wathall). All in all, 20,000 men. This Corps took the right flank of the Army of Tennessee at Rocky Face Ridge and the left flank at Resaca. This corps, known as the III Corps or the Army of Mississippi fought also at Kennesaw Mountain where its commander, Leonidas Polk was killed.
The command switched hands five times during the campaign, first to William Wing Loring for the rest of the battle, but then Alexander P. Stewart took command briefly, but was overruled by Benjamin F. Cheatham who took command for nearly a month. After heavy fighting, the Corps finally went to Alexander P. Stewart again who commanded it until the surrender.
The Corps fought heavily at Peachtree Creek, where it broke through George Henry Thomas's lines. At Atlanta the Corps was in reserve and missed Ezra Church as well as Jonesboro. The Corps, while the smallest in the army suffered the least between the three Corps.
Franklin–Nashville.
When army commander John Bell Hood invaded Tennessee, the III Corps went with it. It fought heavily at Altoona Pass, and assaulted the Union right at the disastrous Battle of Franklin. Suffering heavy losses, the corps was merely a large division once it arrived at Nashville. The III Corps was on the left flank for the first part of the battle, where it suffered heavily. It was later transferred to the center where it suffered lightly by muskets but fled the field.
The corps went to the Carolinas afterwards, fighting at the Battle of Bentonville. It surrendered with the rest of the army.

Nabi Shu'ayb

Nabi Shu'aib (also transliterated Neby Shoaib, meaning "the Prophet Jethro") is the name used in English to refer to a site in the destroyed village of Hittin not far from Tiberias, where the tomb of the Islamic prophet Shuaib (Biblical Jethro) is believed to be located.
A central figure in the Druze religion, the tomb of Nabi Shuaib, has been a site of annual pilgrimage for the Druze for centuries. Sunni Muslims also used to make "ziyarat" ("pilgrimages") there as well, though on no fixed date in the year. Shrines dedicated to Nabi Shuaib are common throughout the Greater Syria region. 
Since the establishment of Israel in 1948, and the subsequent transfer of sole custodianship of the tomb to the Druze community by the Israeli authorities, Sunni Muslims have largely ceased their pilgrimages to Nabi Shuaib. The Druze continue to make an annual pilgrimage there every April between the 25th and the 28th. 
History.
In Islamic and Druze tradition, it is believed that towards the end of his life, Shuaib took refuge in a cave outside Hittin, where he eventually died of old age. His followers buried him at the site and placed a tombstone at his grave. Another Druze tradition holds that Saladin had a dream the night prior to his battle against the Crusaders at Hittin. In the dream, an angel promised him victory on the condition that after the battle, he would ride his horse westward; then, where the horse would stop, the angel said he would find the burial site of Shuaib. The tradition holds that when Saladin's dream was realized, the Druze built a shrine for Shuaib at the site. 
Nabi Shuaib has been expanded and renovated over time. The older section of the existing structure was built in the 1880s, after the spiritual leader of the Druze, Sheikh Muhanna Tarif from Julis, summoned an assembly of religious leaders in the community to discuss and collaborate on its construction. A delegation of high-ranking community members traveled to Syria and Lebanon in order to collect funds for new construction and renovations and the local Druze of the Galilee and Mount Carmel also made considerable contributions. 
When Palestine came under British Mandate rule, a dispute broke out between the Druze and the Higher Islamic Council over who exercised custodianship over the site of Nabi Shuaib. After Israel's establishment in 1948, and the total depopulation of Hittin which had been a predominantly Muslim village, the Druze were granted full custodianship over the tomb, and an additional 100 dunams surrounding it. Under the leadership of Sheikh Amin Tarif, the shrine was then renovated and numerous rooms were added for the hosting of pilgrims. The Israeli government also paved the road leading to Naby Shuaib and provided electricity and water infrastructure services there.
Pilgrimage.
The first mention of the tomb dates back to the 12th century CE, and the Druze have held religious festivals there for centuries. According to Druze tradition, the imprint of Shuaib's left foot ("da'sa") can be seen on the grave. Pilgrims visiting the site pour oil into the imprint, and then rub the oil over their body in order to be blessed with good fortune.
The Druze customarily had no fixed date for their annual pilgrimage, which generally occurred sometime in the spring. When the Israeli government granted official recognition of the pilgrimage as a Druze religious holiday, the dates were standardized, such that the event now takes place between April 25 and April 28. During the festivities, mass celebrations are held at Nabi Shu'aib, and Druze religious leaders gather there for ritual purposes and to discuss religious questions. Prior to Israel's establishment, Druze from Syria and Lebanon also used to participate in the festival, but are no longer able to do so today.

Iris, The Happy Professor or (Professor Iris, as it was called in the United States, where it aired on TLC as part of Ready Set Learn) was a Canadian-produced television puppet show that ran from 1992 to 1994, revolving around Professor Iris, a purple ibis who taught his class, which included his three students; Piano, Skeleton, and Plant. The Professor would teach a variety of subjects to his students and would always wear bowties based on whatever the lesson was, not unlike Ms. Frizzle and her dresses from The Magic School Bus. Also featured on the show was Ms. Principal, the school's headmistress who would often come in, complaining about the noises.

Torben Oxe

Torben Oxe (died 29 November 1517) was a Danish nobleman and a member of an aristocratic family.
Oxe was the son of Johan Oxe of Tordsø and Inger Torbensdatter Bille. Both his father and grandfather had served as Danish Councillors ("dansk rigsråd"). His nephew Peder Oxe, would become the future Danish finance minister and Steward of the Realm. Torben Oxe served as a liege man of King Christian II of Denmark, under whom from 1514, he was governor of Copenhagen Castle. He also inherited a fief in Kronborg from his father who died in 1490. 
During the summer of 1517, Torben Oxe was accused of murdering Dyveke Sigbritsdatter, King Christian II's mistress, with some poisoned cherries. Dyveke's mother Sigbrit Willoms, the widow of a Dutch merchant, acted as an advisor to the king, to the displeasure of much of the Danish nobility.
Torben Oxe was first tried and acquitted by the State Council. King Christian II did not accept the judgment and had Oxe indicted by a court consisting of a jury from Solbjerg outside Copenhagen. Oxe was charged in what amounted to a justice-of-the-peace court with vague offences against his liege lord, Christian II. The verdict as directed by the king was guilty and the death sentence imposed. He was condemned to death, traditionally in the words: ""Vi dømmer ham ikke, men hans gerninger dømmer ham"" (We do not condemn him - his deeds condemn him) beheaded and buried in the graveyard of St. Gertrude's Hospital ("St Gertruds Kloster") in Copenhagen.
Members of the Royal Council of the State ("Rigsraadet") disapproved of the execution of Oxe, who was a popular figure. The execution further alienated Christian II from the nobles and the people of Copenhagen. Thereafter the king lost no opportunity to suppress the nobility and raise commoners to power.
A famous painting by Eilif Peterssen titled "Christian II Signing the Death Warrant of Torben Oxe" is present in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo, Norway.

G132-class torpedo boat

The "G132" class of torpedo boats was a group of large torpedo boats built for the German Kaiserliche Marine in the early 20th century. 
They were part of the group of 48 "Großes Torpedoboot 1898" vessels which were "Hochsee Torpedoboot" ("High seas torpedo boat") built to varying designs by Germaniawerft and Schichau.
The class comprised five ships: "G132", "G133", "G134", "G135", and "G136". German torpedo boats were designated by shipbuilder; in the case of the "G132" class, the ships were all built by Germaniawerft in Kiel, as denoted by the "G". All five ships saw active service, and were scrapped after the end of World War I, in 1921.
Armament.
The first three ships of the class, "G132", "G133", and "G134", were equipped with four 5.2 cm (2 in) SK L/55 guns in single gun mounts. These guns fired a shell that weighed at a muzzle velocity of . The guns could elevate up to 20 degrees, at a maximum range of . The last two ships of the class were equipped with two of the 5.2 cm guns and one 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/35 gun. The 8.8 cm gun fired a shell weighing at a muzzle velocity of . The gun could be elevated to 25 degrees, for a maximum range of . All five of the ships carried three 45 cm (17.7 in) deck-mounted single torpedo tubes.

<doc id="20302094" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20302094" title="Professional performances">
Professional performances

Professional performances, as opposed to amateur performances, are those in which performers receive payment for their performances. Professional performances are engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work. A professional actor is someone who derives income by participating in professional performances. A professional theatre company auditions actors to perform in their professional theatre. The company sells tickets; actors receive payment for their performances. This is the same for musicians, dancers, comedians. Also see: professional sports.
A professional performer is a person in a profession that requires certain types of skilled work requiring formal training or education. In western nations, such as the United States, the term commonly describes highly educated, salaried workers, who enjoy considerable work autonomy, economic security, a comfortable salary, and are commonly engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work. A professional athlete is someone who derives income by participating in competitive sports. Sometimes also called "commercial grade".
Work.
Definition.
A professional is a worker required to possess a large body of knowledge derived from extensive academic study (usually tertiary), with the training almost always formalized. Professionals are at least to a degree self-regulating, in that they control the training and evaluation processes that admit new persons to the field, and in judging whether the work done by their members is up to standard. This differs from other kinds of work where regulation (if considered necessary) is imposed by the state, or where official quality standards are often lacking. Professions have some historical links to guilds in these regards.
Professionals usually exercise autonomy in the workplace, and are expected to utilize their independent judgement and professional ethics in carrying out their responsibilities. This holds true even if they are employees instead of working on their own. Typically a professional provides a service (in exchange for payment or salary), in accordance with established protocols for licensing, ethics, procedures, standards of service and training / certification.
The above definitions were echoed by economist and sociologist Max Weber, who noted that professions are defined by the power to exclude and control admission to the profession, as well as by the development of a particular vocabulary specific to the occupation, and at least somewhat incomprehensible to outsiders.
A 'true' professional must be proficient in all criteria for the field of work they are practising professionally in. Criteria include following:
Trades.
In narrow usage, not all expertise is considered a profession. Although sometimes referred to as professions, such occupations as skilled construction work are more generally thought of as trades or crafts. The completion of an apprenticeship is generally associated with skilled labor or trades such as carpenter, electrician, plumber, bricklayer and other similar occupations. A related (though not always valid) distinction would be that a professional does mainly mental or administrative work, as opposed to engaging in physical work. Many companies include the word professional in their company name to signify the quality of their workmanship or service in exchange with payment.
Sport.
In sports, a professional is someone who participates for money. The opposite is amateur, meaning a person who does not play for money, but in an academic (e.g. college football) or other private setting. The term "professional" is commonly used incorrectly when referring to sports, as the distinction simply refers to how the athlete is funded, and not necessarily to what competitions he engages in or what results he achieves.
Sometimes the professional status of an activity is controversial; for example, there is debate as to whether professionals should be allowed to compete in the Olympic Games. The motivation for money (either in rewards, salaries or advertising revenue) is sometimes seen as a corrupting influence, tainting a sport.

List of Spanish football champions

The Spanish football champions are the winners of the primary football competition in Spain, La Liga. The league is contested on a round robin basis and the championship awarded to the team that is top of the league at the end of the season. La Liga, first established in 1929, originally contained ten teams. Before La Liga's organization, the Copa del Rey—a regionalised cup competition—was effectively the national championship. La Liga is contested in by 20 teams; the three lowest-placed teams are relegated to the Segunda División and replaced by the top three teams in that division. Of the founding teams in La Liga, only Real Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao have not been relegated. The league was cancelled between 1936 and 1939 because of the Spanish Civil War.
Real Madrid and Barcelona are the most successful clubs; they have won 32 and 22 titles, respectively, . No other club has won the title on more than nine occasions; the most recent club other than Real Madrid and Barcelona to win the league is Valencia in the 2003–04 season. Athletic Bilbao has won the Spanish version of The Double the most, having won the league and cup in the same year five times in its history. Barcelona is the only Spanish team that has won The Treble, which includes the UEFA Champions League along with the league and Copa del Rey. The current champions are Barcelona, who won the 2012–13 competition.

Symbolic boundaries

Symbolic boundaries are a theory of how people form social groups proposed by cultural sociologists.
Symbolic boundaries are “conceptual distinctions made by social actors…that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership.” 
Symbolic boundaries are a “necessary but insufficient” condition for social change. “Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character… and become social boundaries.”
Durkheim.
Durkheim saw the symbolic boundary between sacred and profane as the most profound of all social facts, and the one from which lesser symbolic boundaries were derived.
Rituals - secular or religious - were for Durkheim the means by which groups maintained their symbolic/moral boundaries. 
Mary Douglas has subsequently emphasised the role of symbolic boundaries in organising experience, private and public, even in a secular society; while other neo-Durkheimians highlight the role of deviancy as one of revealing and making plain the symbolic boundaries that uphold moral order, and of providing an opportunity for their communal reinforcement. As Durkheim himself put it, "Crime brings together upright consciences and concentrates them...to talk of the event and wax indignant in common", thereby reaffirming the collective barriers that have been breached.
Transgressing boundaries.
Prejudice is often the result of crossing the symbolic boundaries that preserve a group's sense of itself - boundaries that as with a nation's frontiers may in fact be real as well as symbolic. (The ancient ceremony of beating the bounds highlights that overlapping of real and symbolic bounds). Salman Rushdie has emphasised the role of the migrant as a postmodern representative, transgressing symbolic boundaries, and (potentially at least) demonised by their upholders in the host nation as a result.
Marjorie Garber has explored the role of the transvestite in crossing the symbolic boundaries of gender - something which she considered tended to challenge those of race as well.
Symbolic/social boundaries.
Symbolic boundaries are distinct from “social boundaries" that are "objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to an unequal distribution of resources… and social opportunities.”
Play.
Playing may be seen as a way of testing social boundaries - the unspoken frames set about social activities. Humour too provides a way of illuminating, testing and perhaps also shifting symbolic boundaries.

Carl Adolf Otth

Carl Adolf (Adolphe) Otth (April 2 1803, Bern - May 16 1839) was a Swiss physician and naturalist. He was the brother of mycologist Gustav Heinrich Otth (1806-1874).
In 1822 he studied medicine in Bern, and afterwards attended classes on natural history in Geneva, where he had as instructors, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle (1778-1841) and Nicolas Charles Seringe (1776-1858). He later studied medicine at the Universities of Kiel and Berlin, where in 1828 he received his doctorate. After six months in Paris, he returned to Bern. 
In 1836 as a naturalist, he journeyed to Dauphiné and Provence in France, to the Balearic Islands and also to Algeria. From these travels he collected a large number of insect, reptile and amphibian species. In 1837 he was the first to describe the frog genus "Discoglossus" based on studies of the Mediterranean painted frog ("Discoglossus pictus").
In 1838 he published a book with thirty lithographs based on a trip to Algiers, titled "Esquisses africaines, dessinées pendant un voyage a Alger et lithographiées par Adolphe Otth". In 1839 during a journey to the Middle East, he died in Jerusalem at the age of 36.

The Pussycat Dolls and Polow Da Don had previously collaborated, but it marks his first time as a featured artist. He co-produced "Buttons" ("PCD", 2005) and produced "Whatcha Think About That" ("Doll Domination", 2008). The vocals were recorded by Ian Mereness, Abel Garibaldi, Jeff Meeks and Eric Schlotzer at The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, Illinois. It was mixed by Dave Pensado and Jaycen Joshua with Kelly serving as a mixing assistant. It was programmed by Mereness, Meeks and Schlotzer. Kelly also appears as a featured artist courtesy of Jive Records. 
The song follows R. Kelly cleared of child pornography charges Speaking about the collaboration Nicole Scherzinger said, "It is Kelly first track back and whatever has happened or hasn't happened, I cannot judge anybody. A hit is a hit and a song is a song and Kelly is undeniably an amazing songwriter. So it was an honour that he wrote this song specifically for us."
Composition.
"Out of This Club" is a contemporary urban, pop which lasts for a duration of 4:08 (four minutes and 8 seconds). Described as "a bump-and-grind slowie" the song' instrumentation consists of "rudimentary piano melodies" and a "plush beat against a romantic chorus." The song samples the line, "If you ain't got no money, take your broke ass home", taken from Fergie's "Glamorous" (2007). Glenn Gamboa noted that the song could be a sequel to Usher's "Love In This Club" which lyrics are of a lusting desire to have sexual intercourse in a nightclub while "Out of This Club" portrays "the Pussycat Dolls love outside the club."
Critical reception.
Music critics were divided on "Out Of This Club"; The songs production was praised as well as criticized. Nic Oliver of MusicOMH liked the song writing, "R Kelly does a fine job on the slow jam 'Out Of The Club'". Bill Lamb of About.com commented " Polow da Don rolls out the Nth version of Usher's "Love In This Club" on 'Out of the Club.'" Glenn Gamboa from "Newsday" liked the song for "sweet and fresh." Christian Hoard of "Rolling Stone" was also complimentary of the song writing, "R. Kelly mixes sweet and sassy on the catchy slow jam." He also described the guests "worth the money." The song garnered a mixed review from Spence D. for IGN writing, "[the song is pretty standard sex you up fare (you wouldn't expect anything less from Kelly, would you?)." He continued the "studio tricknology where the Dolls voices are layered on top of one another in a cascading fashion is far from cutting edge, but sounds cool regardless." Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine negatively critiqued the song, describe the lyrics as "bottom-notch" "courtesy of R. Kelly". Jaime Gill of Yahoo! UK & Ireland criticized the song and writing "The nadir is reached on 'Out Of This Club'. He continued "This could have been a spiky female riposte to the 'let's have sex in this nitespot toilet' genre pioneered by Nelly, Usher and R Kelly." An editor of "Blender" magazine gave the song two out of five stars commenting, "[Nicole sounds annoyingly sulky here, like her mom is dragging her off the dance floor."
Charts.
The song only managed to enter at number 24 on the US "Billboard" Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles, a component chart which represents the 25 songs which failed to make an impact on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

Don Coles

Donald L. Coles, also known as Don Coles, is a Canadian poet and a novelist. Coles won the 1993 Governor General's Award for English poetry for his collection "Forests of the Medieval World" and the Trillium Book Award in 2000 for his collection "Kurgan".
Don Coles was born on April 12, 1927, in Woodstock, Ontario. He attended the University of Toronto and received a B.A in modern History in 1949, and an M.A in English Literature in 1952. He then attended the University of Cambridge where he eventually earned a second M.A in Canadian Literature. Coles' writing began to take off after he received a British Council grant, which allowed him a year in Italy. Coles spent the following ten to twelve years traveling around Europe and lived in London, Stockholm, Florence, Munich, Copenhagen, Hamburg, and Zurich. Coles had struggled with writing and while in Europe he wrote two unpublished novels. “I was bad at characterization, I was bad at dialogue, I was bad at plot…” he told The National Post. After he returned home in 1965 he joined the faculty of York University, where he worked for 30 years. He taught humanities, and was the Director of the Creative Writing program. Furthermore, he was the senior editor at the Banff Centre for the Arts from 1984 to 1994. Don Coles was influenced by many British writers during the time he was living in Europe. These early influences were Thomas Hardy, Philip Larkin, Donald Hall, John Berryman and Margaret Atwood, with whom he worked at York University. Coles first began writing poetry around 1966 and soon published his first collection in Canada in 1975 with Macmillan, "Sometimes All Over". Coles' first novel, "Doctor Bloom’s Story" was not published until 2004. His other collections, seven of which were published in Canada and one published in England, include "Anniversaries" (1979); "The Prinzhorn Collection" (1982); "Landslides": selected poems, 1975-1985 (1986); "K. in Love" (1987); "Little Bird" (1991); "Forests of the Medieval World" (1993); "Someone Has Stayed in Stockholm" (1994, published in England); and "For the Living and the Dead" (1996, a translation from the Swedish). Don Coles is retired and currently resides in Toronto.
Critical Reception.
Don Coles is an accomplished and respected novelist who has been praised for his sophisticated and witty writing. His writing style is casual and he stays clear of flashiness, yet his writing is much more complex than perceived. Coles pulls the reader through his writing in a gradual flow, diving through time. He is best known for "Doctor Bloom’s Story"; "A straight-ahead, spryly imagined, tightly written tale of suspense. …This is fabulous stuff. Doctor Bloom's Story has countless… moments that, in their combination of gaiety and sadness, fix themselves in your imagination… Doctor Bloom is surely one of the most memorable and triumphantly conceived characters in recent Canadian fiction."

The Protomen

The Protomen is an American rock band best known for composing original concept albums loosely based on the popular video game series Mega Man.
History.
Little is known about The Protomen, other than that the band is based in Nashville, Tennessee. Their stage names are largely references to pop culture films, song titles, and fictional characters. The group members refer to themselves as storytellers, creating a "rock and roll fable"; they are not characters in their stories. 
The band is composed mostly of MTSU recording program graduates, and first came to be so that they could meet class deadlines and the need to record for their grades. Their first live performance was in April 2004. Most of the band had graduated and moved to Nashville by 2005.
In a 2009 interview, lead vocalist Panther stated, "We basically gathered up all of our good friends from the local rock bands of Murfreesboro, tied ourselves together, and tried to walk. And somehow it worked. At the time, we noticed a void in rock and roll. A hole that could only really be filled with grown men and women painting up like robots and playing some fierce and furious rock music based on a 1980s video game. We were fairly certain no one else was going to fill that hole. But, by god, it's filled now. You can thank us later."
The band has strong ties to the Murfreesboro and Nashville independent music scene, and some members are integrated into several bands simultaneously.
Concepts and themes.
The Protomen's work is inspired by the first six NES "Mega Man" games. This franchise has an existing storyline featured in the games, manga, and anime; however, The Protomen have concocted a dark and dystopian version of the game's underlying world. The group is generally uninterested in concerns of making their story adhere to the original. Instead, they view the games as a jumping-off point for the story they want to tell, and have borrowed surface attributes of some characters while heavily altering their histories and functions. 
The group has stated that they intend to make a three-part story. Two of the parts are complete. The third is currently in outline form.
The overall story as envisioned by the group is tragic, and they "don't really expect it to end well for humanity." 
Act I (The Protomen).
In Act I, the band's first album, Dr. Wily is represented as an Orwellian ruler over a dystopic city, full of humans who are too scared to stand up to his control. Dr. Light creates a "perfect man, an unbeatable machine", Proto Man, to fight to free the City, but Proto Man is destroyed by the overwhelming power of Wily's armies. Defeated and despairing, Dr. Light then creates a second son, Mega Man, whom he attempts to dissuade from battle. Mega Man runs away from home and confronts his brother in an apocalyptic concluding battle. The album has been described by the band as "the sound of the end of the world" and straddles the line between chiptune and hard rock, with heavier focus on distorted 8-bit synthesizers and electronic instrumentation.
Group member Commander has stated that Act I "was made specifically to go against everything our recording teachers and fellow students were trying to feed us about making everything sound pristine and 'perfect.'". The album was recorded over two years in various Murfreesboro studios, using analog rather than digital production techniques. "Due Vendetta", the group's first recorded track, was completed in April 2003. The album was produced by then-Protomen member Heath Who Hath No Name.
Act II (Act II: The Father of Death).
For the band's second album the group, working with Meat Loaf producer Alan Shacklock, devised a prequel storyline to Act I. The second act details the rise of Albert Wily to power, the rivalry between himself and Thomas Light, and the tragic events which brought the City under Wily's control. The band states that Act II was designed to sound cleaner, reflecting a time "before the bomb dropped". Accordingly, the second album reflects a much broader range of musical styles and more lyrical instrumentation, embracing references from Ennio Morricone to Bruce Springsteen to Shacklock's own Babe Ruth. The album was mastered by Richard Dodd, a Grammy-winning recording engineer.
Cover albums.
The band performs a variety of '70s & '80s cover songs along very specific themes in live performances, usually related to the band's preferred motifs of heroism, struggle, and self-determination. Because these covers have been consistently popular with the group's fans, they announced their intentions to formally record them in November 2010 while performing at InDisFest in Atlanta, GA. Recording began on February 6, 2011 with Act II producer, Alan Shacklock. 
In addition, they planned to release a full length of Queen covers, recorded live in Nashville, TN during a Queen/Black Sabbath tribute concert on December 10, 2010. Though set for a June 1, 2012 release, the album shipped early to those who pre-ordered it.
Musical style and influences.
The group has cited the influence of "artists like Syd Mead, films like Eddie and the Cruisers and Streets of Fire, books like 1984 and Atlas Shrugged... those are the pretty obvious ones you can pull out of Acts I and II. But what you might not realize is that we own every Ernest movie ever made. And we watch them all the time.". Apart from previously mentioned, the band also draws inspiration from a huge array of other diverse sources, including Sergio Leone's films, the song The Mexican and musical groups Radiohead, Styx, Toto, Queen and Alabama.
Major festivals and convention appearances.
The Protomen have performed at a number of conventions, festivals and showcases throughout their career.
In 2007, The Protomen played at Capcom's booth at San Diego Comic Con by Capcom's invitation. In 2009, the group competed for and won the right to perform at the Bonnaroo music festival, defeating several other Nashville bands. They played two showcases at CMJ Music Marathon in October of the same year. In 2010, The Protomen took part in the SXSW music festival and the mega-gaming conventions in PAX East in Boston (2010-2013) and PAX 2010 in Seattle. In 2011, they performed at the Houston Free Press Summer Fest. The Protomen have performed at the 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 Nerdapalooza Festival in Orlando, FL and began their 2011 run at MAGFest 9 in Alexandria, VA. The Protomen have made an appearance at the Middle Tennessee Anime Convention (MTAC) in Nashville, Tennessee twice; once in 2007, and again in 2011. The Protomen have also performed in Eau Claire, WI at the Plaza Hotel and Suites for No Brand Con 2013. They will be playing Warped Tour 2014 for its entire run.

Total care

Total care is where long term care facilities for residents are responsible for meeting all the needs of a resident. While some residents receiving so-called total care may be able to independently meet all or some of their needs for their activities of daily living without the assistance of a caregiver, the facility and its staff have the duty of monitoring the resident to be sure s/he is having those needs met.
The term "total care" is also used within long term care facilities to refer to residents who need actual assistance in meeting all their needs in their activities of daily living. Those who need little or no assistance are referred to as "self care."
Some facilities have special units reserved for those dependent on total care. Others specialize specifically in residents in need of total care. Some facilities cannot handle total care residents, and when one becomes needy of such care, the facility will transfer the resident to another facility.
It is not uncommon for a resident to enter a facility able to meet one's needs independently, but later to come in need of total care.
Many facilities will house total care residents in the less desirable parts of the buildings, such as upper floors or rear wings, and place the self care residents in better health near the entrance for a better impression. This is considered to be controversial for the stigma it brings to such residents, though it does not necessarily mean substandard care.
Losses of a total care patient.
Residents of long term care facilities who are receiving total care will typically suffer in the following ways:
Hazards faced by total care patients.
Besides the inevitable possibility of death caused by the conditions of a total care resident, their lives are also at risk due to the dangers caused by their care.
Neglect is common among total care residents. Many residents who are immobile must have their weight carried by caregivers, who often do not like this type of work and try to cut corners and do it minimally or avoid it altogether.
Many total care residents are left in one position for a long time, which can lead to the breakdown of their skin, bed sores, and insufficient circulation.
Feeding becomes an issue with total care patients. Some recipients of total care have difficulty swallowing, thereby posing a choking hazard. This can be increased when hurried caregivers stuff the food into their mouths.

Native American Heritage Day is a civil holiday observed on the day after Thanksgiving in the United States.
National legislative history.
President George W. Bush signed into law legislation introduced by Congressman Joe Baca (D-Rialto), to designate the Friday after Thanksgiving as Native American Heritage Day. The Native American Heritage Day Bill was supported by the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) and 184 federally recognized tribes, and designates Friday, November 28, 2008, as a day to pay tribute to Native Americans for their many contributions to the United States.
The Native American Heritage Day Bill encourages Americans of all backgrounds to observe Friday, November 28, 2008, as Native American Heritage Day, through appropriate ceremonies and activities. It also encourages public elementary and secondary schools to enhance student understanding of Native Americans by providing classroom instructions focusing on their history, achievements, and contributions.
The House of Representatives originally passed H.J. Res. 62 on November 13, 2007. The bill was passed with technical adjustments by unanimous consent in the United States Senate on September 22, 2008. Then, on September 26, 2008, the House of Representatives unanimously voted to pass the legislation again, this time including the adjustments from the Senate. The legislation was signed into public law by the President on October 8, 2008.
Some individual states have also taken legislative action to recognize this day. For example, Maryland established this day in 2008 under the name American Indian Heritage Day.

Helen Ukpabio

Helen Ukpabio is the founder and head of African Evangelical franchise Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries based in Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria. She was born in the village of Mbente, Imo State, Nigeria and is married to Dr. Elijah Ukpabio. She has three children.
During her early life she was educated at St. George's Catholic School in Falomo, Jinadu Anglican School in Obalende and the Methodist Girls' School in Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom State, all in south-eastern Nigeria.
In 1992, Ukpabio founded Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries with the aim of spreading her often literal interpretations of the Holy Bible to the people of West Africa. The belief most often associated with Mrs. Ukpabio and her organisation is a claim that Satan has the ability to manifest himself in the bodies of children by demonic possession and make them become his servants in the form of 'witches' or 'wizards'.
Exploiting superstitious beliefs, particularly those related to spiritual or demonic possession or witchcraft, Helen Ukpabio's organisation has grown exponentionally throughout Nigeria and West Africa since its foundation. There are now major Liberty Gospel Churches in Cameroon, Ghana and South Africa as well as Nigeria.
Controversial views.
Ukpabio has published her views in several books. An example is 'Unveiling The Mysteries of Witchcraft', in which she states that:
If a child under the age of two screams in the night, cries and is always feverish with deteriorating health he or she is a servant of Satan.
A fact not mentioned in the book is that these symptoms are common in young children, especially in areas like Nigeria with poor health and high levels of malaria.
She also produces a number of films to spread the view that children can become possessed by evil spirits through her film production company, Liberty Films, part of the Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries franchise. The most famous of these is "End of The Wicked" in which child actors are shown to eat human flesh and murder their parents.
Media references.
In 2007 an Observer newspaper article claimed Ukpabio and other evangelical pastors were encouraging an upsurge in the numbers of children being accused of witchcraft and being abused and stigmatised by parents and communities as a result.
In 2008, the TV news documentary "Dispatches Saving Africa's Witch Children" by UK broadcaster Channel 4 stated the views that she expresses have led to a massive upsurge in children stigmatised and abandoned by their families in West Africa, particularly in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. Both reports followed the activities of two charities, CRARN and Stepping Stones Nigeria, which aimed to look after the children who have been rejected by their parents for displaying what they believed to be signs of witchcraft, assertions which have also been made by the Associated Press. "The Telegraph" Thursday 14 April 2011. The accusation and her defense against them have been reported in "The New York Times". A 2009 conference in Nigeria that was critical of her organization was reportedly violently disrupted by members of her organization.

Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.

Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., , is a decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court reaffirmed the validity of the patent exhaustion doctrine, and in doing so made uncertain the continuing precedential value of a line of decisions in the Federal Circuit that had sought to limit Supreme Court exhaustion doctrine decisions to their facts and to require a so-called “rule of reason” analysis of all post-sale restrictions other than tie-ins and price fixes. In the course of restating the patent exhaustion doctrine, the Court held that the exhaustion doctrine is triggered by, among other things, an authorized sale of a component when the only reasonable and intended use of the component is to practice the patent and the component substantially embodies the patented invention by embodying its essential features. The Court also overturned, in passing, the part of decision below that held that the exhaustion doctrine was limited to product claims and did not apply to method claims.
Factual background.
LG Electronics (LGE) owned several patents on methods and systems for processing information. It entered into two contracts with Intel. In the License Agreement, LGE authorized Intel to make and sell microprocessor products using the patented inventions. Moreover, the License Agreement expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products (for example, for combining Intel microprocessor products with other parts of a computer). The License Agreement also provided, however, “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.” 
In the Master Agreement, LGE required Intel to give its customers notice that the patent license does not extend to any product made by combining a licensed Intel microprocessor product with any other product (for example, a computer containing the Intel microprocessor products). The Master Agreement also provided that its breach would have no effect on the License Agreement and would not be grounds for its termination. Apparently, LGE was willing to allow Intel’s customers to combine the microprocessor products with products not licensed by LGE, but only upon payment of a further royalty to LGE for the right to do so. This point is not discussed in the Court’s opinion, which recites the facts only in very limited terms because the record was under seal to protect trade secrets. 
Quanta Computer purchased licensed Intel microprocessor products and proceeded to manufacture computers containing them. In doing so, Quanta followed Intel’s specifications, which in turn led to practice of the patented methods and making the patented systems that LGE licensed to Intel––since that was the way Intel had designed its microprocessor products. (The trial court found that the Intel microprocessor products were without any reasonable noninfringing use.) LGE then sued Quanta for patent infringement. 
Quanta prevailed in the district court under the exhaustion doctrine, but on appeal the Federal Circuit held that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply because of the statement in the Master Agreement that combination products were not licensed, given the Federal Circuit's 1992 ruling in "Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc. " that a seller of patented goods could by notice impose a post-sale restraint on its customer's use of the goods. Additionally, the Federal Circuit held that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply, in any event, to method patents.
"Mallinckrodt" background.
In "Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc. ", the Federal Circuit had held that patent owners could condition the sale of patented goods with a restrictive notice and thereby restrict the disposition of the goods by the purchasers, with the exception of antitrust law violations, such as price-fixing and tie-in restrictions, or violations of "some other law or policy." More specifically, the "Mallinckrodt" court had said that, “[unless the condition violates some other law or policy (in the patent field, notably the misuse or antitrust law),” patent owners, licensees and downstream purchasers "retain the freedom to contract concerning conditions of sale." The Federal Circuit went on to say that "The appropriate criterion” in determining whether "a restriction or condition... placed upon the sale of a patented article" is valid "is whether patente's or licensor's restriction is reasonably within the patent grant, or whether the patentee has ventured beyond the patent grant and into behavior having an anticompetitive effect not justifiable under the rule of reason.” According to the court, the tests for restrictions and misuse were alike, outside the tie-in and price fixing area: “To sustain a misuse defense involving a licensing arrangement not held to have been per se anticompetitive by the Supreme Court, a factual determination must reveal that the overall effect of the license tends to restrain competition unlawfully in an appropriately defined relevant market.” 
But this Federal Circuit test is contrary to many decisions of both the Supreme Court and other courts of appeals. For example, in "Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.", the Supreme Court addressed the legality of licenses under which royalties were paid on total sales of all products, irrespective of whether the licensor’s patents covered all products. The Court held that such licensing was permissible when the licensor and licensee adopted it for mutual convenience to simplify administration of the license, but it was impermissible for the licensor to insist upon it over the licensee’s opposition. Such conduct was misuse, the Court held, but not an antitrust violation unless the other elements of an antitrust violation were also shown, such as market power. Earlier, in "Brulotte v. Thys Co. ", the Supreme Court held that it was patent misuse if, without more, a patentee charged royalties that extended beyond the statutory term of the patent. In "National Lockwasher Co. v. George K. Garrett Co.", the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that a patentee misused its patent by requiring licensees to agree not to deal in the technology of the patentee’s competitors. Thus, in these cases, among many others, the Supreme Court and other federal courts had found misuse in cases not involving price fixing or tie-ins, and had not required any rule-of-reason or relevant-market analysis.
Other Federal Circuit decisions followed the "Mallinckrodt" approach, which was, at the very least, divergent from Supreme Court decisions. Accordingly, when "certiorari" was granted in "Quanta", it was widely surmised that the Supreme Court would overturn "Mallinckrodt", which many (including the United States Solicitor General, viewed as inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent.       An O'Melveny & Myers commentary advised the law firm's clients: "As set out by the Solicitor General, the Federal Circuit has once again adopted a formalistic rule that does not advance the interest of patent law as articulated by Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, there seems little doubt that the Solicitor General's views will prevail on the merits, and that the Supreme Court will again reverse the Federal Circuit."</ref>
Supreme Court opinion.
The Supreme Court unanimously reversed, in an opinion by Justice Thomas.
Method claims.
First, the distinction between method and product claims is insupportable. In "United States v. Univis Lens Co.", the most recent decision of the Court on exhaustion, some of the patents held exhausted were method patents. Earlier, in "Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States", some patents covered a method of combusting gasoline in an automobile engine––and the exhaustion doctrine was held applicable. Furthermore, because it is easy to write patent claims for the same invention either in method format or apparatus format, the exhaustion doctrine could easily be evaded if reliance on method claims was sufficient to avoid exhaustion: By “including a method claim for the machine’s patented method of performing its task, a patent drafter could shield practically any patented item from exhaustion.”
Exhaustion and related patents.
The Court then turned to the extent, if any, to which exhaustion of the patent rights on the microprocessor products exhausted patent rights relating to the combination products on which LGE had patents. In the "Univis" case the sale that exhausted patent rights was a sale of an unpatented semifinished lens blank, which subsequent processing turned into a patented finished lens. The Intel microprocessor products were finished commercial articles of commerce, but in this case the trial court had found as a fact that the microprocessor products had no noninfringing use, just as in the "Univis" case the semifinished lens blanks had no use but to be finished into the patented finished lens blanks. Therefore, the Court found "Univis" dispositive. In the "Quanta" Court’s language, in "Univis" “exhaustion was triggered by the sale of the lens blanks because their only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent and because they ‘embodieessential features of [the patented invention.’” 
LGE did not challenge the claim that the intended and reasonable use of the microprocessor products was to incorporate them into computers, but it claimed that some noninfringing uses existed: they could be sold overseas, as repair parts, or by disabling the features that made them patented. The Court dismissed these arguments. As for disablement, the Court asserted that the disabled device aspects (“features”) rather than the device that remained must have a noninfringing use, so that disabling them would cause them to have “no real use.” As for foreign or replacement use, the legal test to be looked to was whether the product would perform the patented method or embody the patented product, not whether the use gave rise to infringement liability. 
A further reason why sales of the microprocessor products exhausted LGE’s patent rights was that “everything inventive about each patent is embodied in” the licensed Intel products, which “embody the essential features of the patents because they carry out all the inventive processes when combined, according to their design, with standard components.” Any point of novelty—that is, respect in which the claimed invention departs from the prior art—is found in the licensed microprocessor products rather than in the combination product of which they are components.
This last aspect of the "Quanta" opinion is very similar to the doctrine of the Lincoln Engineering case, a doctrine that the Federal Circuit had previously held to be no longer authoritative. Under the Supreme Court's "Lincoln Engineering" doctrine, the combination of a newly invented device with a known, conventional device with which the new device cooperates in the conventional and predictable way in which devices of those types have previously cooperated is unpatentable as an “exhausted combination” or “old combination.” Thus, when the "Quanta" Court said that “everything inventive about each patent is embodied in” the licensed Intel products, which “embody the essential features of the patents," the Court was, in effect, saying that the combination of a novel Intel microprocessor in a conventional manner with an old personal computer is an exhausted combination. Accordingly, no weight would be put on the fact that separate patents had issued to LGE on the inventive device and on the old combination that included it.
Licensing a limited field.
LGE’s argument for non-exhaustion sought to invoke the doctrine of "General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co." In that case, the patentee had granted no license for “commercial” amplifiers. Therefore, when a manufacturer licensed only in the “non-commercial” field of use sold an amplifier to an accused infringer, who knowingly resold it in the commercial market, the manufacturer “could not convey to accused infringer what both knew it was not authorized to sell.” By parity of reasoning, LGE said, it had licensed Intel only in the field of manufacturing microprocessor products for combination with specified products and not with other products. But the Court said that was not how LGE had drafted its license to Intel:
LGE overlooks important aspects of the structure of the…transaction. Nothing in the License Agreement restricts Intel’s right to sell its microprocessors…to purchasers who intend to combine them with non-Intel parts. It broadly permits Intel to make, use, or sell products free of the patent claims. To be sure, LGE did require Intel to give notice to its customers, including Quanta, that LGE had not licensed those customers to practice its patents. But neither party contends that Intel breached the agreement in that respect.
LGE points out that the License Agreement specifically disclaimed any license to third parties to practice the patents by combining licensed products with other components. But the question whether third parties received implied licenses is irrelevant because Quanta asserts its right to practice the patents based not on implied license but on exhaustion. And exhaustion turns only on Intel’s own license to sell products practicing the…patents.
The Court appears to be saying that LGE simply licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products. LGE expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products; and LGE made Intel tell its customers about the absence of a license. But LGE did "not" say to Intel that LGE licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products only in the field of microprocessor products combined with other LGE-licensed products (so-called Intel products). There was no explicit field-of-use limitation on Intel’s manufacturing, using, and selling rights––no “magic words.” LGE came close––it said it was not licensing third parties to combine licensed product with other products, and it required Intel to notify customers of that––but LGE failed to go right to the point and expressly deny Intel any license to make microprocessor products that would be combined with other products. Furthermore, for some inexplicable reason the parties, with fatal effect, red-flagged the fact that there still was an exhaustion doctrine: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.”
That this was a critical error (for LGE) is confirmed by the Court’s final statements in its opinion: 
The License Agreement authorized Intel to sell products that practiced the patents. No conditions limited Intel’s authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents. …Intel’s authorized sale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly, and as a result, LGE can no longer assert its patent rights against Quanta.
Thus, the exhaustion doctrine governed what Quanta could lawfully do with what it bought from Intel. The failure to give third parties a license to combine Intel microprocessor product with other products had no legal significance, because the exhaustion doctrine obviated any need for such a license. Having bought the products from an authorized seller, Quanta didn't need any license.
No contract issue.
Just before closing, the Court added a final note pointing out that the case did not raise, and the Court did not rule on, whether LGE could have enforced a contractual restriction. In footnote 7, the Court commented:
We note that the authorized nature of the sale to Quanta does not necessarily limit LGE’s other contract rights. LGE’s complaint does not include a breach-of-contract claim, and we express no opinion on whether contract damages might be available even though exhaustion operates to eliminate patent damages.
By the same token, the Court said nothing as to specific performance or whether contract rights, if any, could be enforced against Quanta.
Impact and issues that the court did not consider.
The impact of "Quanta" is problematic, largely because the decision avoided deciding many issues, presumably in the interest of maintaining consensus. (The decision was unanimous.) One academic commented:
It is a very disappointing decision from the Court. It decided so little, and it was such an important case. You are left reading tea leaves.
The Court's failure to approve or reject the precedent on which the Federal Circuit had relied in its decision in "Quanta", "Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.", which had limited the applicability of the exhaustion doctrine when a sale was made "conditional," further contributed to business uncertainty about permissible license restrictions. But, as one commentator observed:
The Supreme Court, in "Quanta", was widely expected to rule on whether "Mallinckrodt" was good law. But the Court sidestepped the issue by narrowly interpreting the license agreement so that it was not a conditional license. ...Because the Supreme Court sidestepped the issue, it remains unclear to what extent a patentee can use a conditional license to impose restrictions on downstream purchasers.
To be sure, in "Quanta", the Court held that “longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item.” But what constitutes "authorization"? The Court did not address the issue of "constructive" authorization—that is, authorization as a matter of law in certain circumstances, whether or not the patentee or licensor likes it or even tries very hard to avoid it. Accordingly, it is uncertain to what extent "Quanta" undoes "Mallinckrodt". That seems to be the unstated message in "Quanta", but the Federal Circuit may take an impenitent view, in defiance of the Solicitor General's views as "amicus".
Other transactional forms.
There are a number of important issues that the Court did not address in "Quanta". One such omission is the Court’s failure to say anything about the other possible formats that this transaction might have used—such as a sale by a manufacturing licensee with a limitation on its grant, or (alternatively) a sale by the patentee or its licensee with explicit restrictions imposed on the buyer's freedom to dispose of the product. The Court did not explain whether or in what circumstances these other formats would be legally effective.
The first of these possible formats follows the pattern of the "General Talking Pictures" case. The second format follows the pattern of the "Mallinckrodt" case. Under the "General Talking Pictures" doctrine, a patentee may limit the scope of a manufacturer-licensee's license to a defined field—such as microprocessors not incorporated into computers—and then the use of those micropressors as computer components is a patent infringement. This is the format that LGE mistakenly thought it was using. Under the "Mallinckrodt" doctrine, a sale of a patented product subject to a restriction—such as you must not sell this microprocessor for use as a computer component—is a "conditional," rather than "unconditional," sale. If the condition is violated the conduct is patent infringement. The exhaustion doctrine does not apply under the rule stated in "Mallinkrodt". However, as "Quanta" seemingly holds, when a restriction is not "clearly and explicitly stated" the exhaustion doctrine applies.
Resolving the "anomaly".
In a brief to the Supreme Court (at its request) when the petition for writ of certiorari was pending, the US Solicitor General observed that a curious "anomaly" existed between the exhaustion doctrine and "General Talking Pictures" doctrine:
is a seeming anomaly in allowing a patentee to achieve indirectly –- through an enforceable condition on the licensee –– a limitation on use or resale that [because of the exhaustion doctrine the patentee could not itself impose on a direct purchaser, the distinction is a necessary and explicable result of the Court’s decision in "General Talking Pictures".
For reasons that so far have not been explained in any publicly available document, the Government deleted this passage from its subsequent brief on the merits. As the Government brief suggested, on the one hand, the exhaustion doctrine prohibits post-sale restraints on a patentee’s (or its licensee’s) sale of goods, while on the other hand "General Talking Pictures" permits a patentee to place post-sale limitations on its manufacturing licensee’s sale of goods "if the license to manufacture uses the right, magic words". Nothing in the "Quanta" opinion addresses this "seeming anomaly," much less attempts to resolve it or synthesize the competing doctrines.
Can contract trump the exhaustion doctrine?
The Court, in a footnote quoted above (the Court's note 7), expressly refrained from stating any of the following: whether contractual language could overcome, or prevent triggering, the exhaustion doctrine; if so, what language would be effective to do so; and whether the surrounding circumstances would be relevant. 
To the extent that the exhaustion doctrine is grounded in considerations of public policy, and to the extent that the interests of the public and third parties (such as Quanta in the "Quanta" case) are to be considered as well as those of the contracting parties, the courts may be more likely to place limits on whether the parties can by contract make the doctrine inapplicable to the goods that are the subject of their contract. On the other hand, if the policy of the exhaustion doctrine is seen merely as a rule to make sure that downstream purchasers get fair notice that their use of goods whose purchase they are considering will be restricted, courts may be more likely to uphold such restrictions unless they collide with other policies, such as those of competition or antitrust law. 
The Court explicitly refused to consider this issue in "Quanta". The "Quanta" court did make clear, however, that it recognized the fundamental difference in law between a sale of patented goods by a patentee and a patentee’s license of another to manufacture the patented goods, which the Supreme Court had explained in "United States v. General Electric Co." At the same time, the Court made it clear that LGE had failed to license Intel (the seller to Quanta) in language that invoked the General Talking Pictures doctrine, which could have changed the outcome, as discussed above in the section of this article captioned “Licensing a limited field.”
The House of Lords considered whether contract could trump the similar doctrine against derogation from title in British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.. This is the doctrine that a seller may not successfully take actions, such as enforcing an intellectual property right, that decrease the value of what the seller has sold to a purchaser. The House of Lords ruled that contract could not be used to lessen the rights of end user purchasers, at least purchasers of consumer products such as motor cars.
Subsequent decisions.
"Static Control".
In "Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int’l, Inc.", 615 F.Supp.2d 575 (E.D. Ky, 2009), the district court reconsidered its former decision in this case and granted a judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) in favor of the accused infringer. The court said that the Supreme Court’s "Quanta" decision “has changed the landscape of the doctrine of patent exhaustion generally, and specifically” required a reversal of the judgment, so that SCCI was not liable to Lexmark for patent infringement. 
Lexmark had sought to restrict the refilling of its toner cartridges by relying on the "Mallinckrodt" doctrine. However, it did not enter into any conventional bilateral contract selling the toner cartridges to the public on a “conditional sale” basis. Instead, Lexmark relied on “shrinkwrap licenses,” and restrictive notices accompanying the products. The court considered these ineffective to prevent application of the exhaustion doctrine, despite "Mallinckrodt"’s approval of their use. 
The court acknowledged that, “s Lexmark points out, the Supreme Court did not expressly overrule "Mallinckrodt" in its "Quanta" opinion.” Nonetheless, the court concluded:
After reviewing "Quanta", "Mallinckrodt", and the parties' arguments, this Court is persuaded that "Quanta" overruled "Mallinckrodt sub silentio". The Supreme Court's broad statement of the law of patent exhaustion simply cannot be squared with the position that the "Quanta" holding is limited to its specific facts. Further, the Federal Circuit relied in part on
"Mallinckrodt" in reaching its decision in "LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc"., 453 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the decision the Supreme Court reversed in "Quanta". It is also worth noting that the "Quanta" decision did not mention a single Federal Circuit case.
On the other hand, the court did not consider "Quanta" to have foreclosed the enforcement of the shrinkwrap restrictions under state contract law. The contract law aspects of the case became moot, however, because Lexmark voluntarily dismissed its claims based on Static Control's tortious interference with contract.

Andersonville Raiders

The Andersonville Raiders were a band of rogue soldiers incarcerated at the Confederate Andersonville Prison during the American Civil War. Led by their chieftains – Charles Curtis, John Sarsfield, Patrick Delaney, Teri Sullivan (aka "WR Rickson", according to other sources), William Collins, and A. Munn – these soldiers terrorized their fellow prisoners, robbing their possessions and sometimes even committing murder.
An internal force of soldiers with a policing role, called the "Regulators", was eventually formed to counter the Raiders' theft and violence. In the early summer of 1864, leading members were finally brought to trial. On July 11, 1864, six of the Raiders' leaders were hanged, concluding the group's control of the Confederate prison.
Historical context.
Formally called "Camp Sumter", Andersonville (as it was later named by prisoners) was established in February 1864 in the small town of Andersonville, Georgia. The camp was established in response to a surplus in prisoners-of-war (POWs) that was the result of a breakdown in POW exchanges in 1863. The surplus had led to overcrowding in Confederate-run POW camps across the northern part of the Confederacy, particularly in the Richmond camps. As a result, the Confederacy needed to create a large Southern prison that could handle a considerable population of inmates.
Andersonville, Georgia, was chosen as a strategic location for the Confederacy's new prison due to its small location and close proximity to fresh water and railroad. Originally about , the camp would later be expanded to . The entire camp was surrounded by a high stockade, with large guard towers known as "pigeon roosts" located every 30 yards. Located about from the stockade was a smaller fence called the "dead line" (so termed because any prisoner who crossed this fence would be shot).
Its creators built Andersonville not for quality but with the dual priorities of preventing escape and enabling as many prisoners as possible to be housed within the new camp. No wooden barracks were built; prisoners were required to live in self-built tents. At its height in August 1864, the camp housed over 30,000 Union prisoners of war.
Prison conditions.
Conditions at Andersonville were among the worst of all Civil War prison camps; the camp was extremely overcrowded and starvation was a common cause of death. The overcrowding, coupled with unsanitary conditions, caused illnesses to flourish within the camp. When food was available, prisoners would often suffer from diseases caused by contaminated food and water. Dysentery, scurvy, and gangrene became prolific as a result of the harsh conditions and poor quality of food.
In addition to the severe health issues, records indicate that guards often behaved sadistically, sometimes killing prisoners regardless of whether they were breaking camp rules or crossing over the "dead line". Contributing to the fearsome conditions were the Andersonville Raiders, who used theft, murder, and terror to obtain goods and power within the prison.
Organization and methods.
"The Raiders", as they were called within the camp, were known throughout Andersonville for their harsh tactics and vicious behavior towards their fellow inmates. According to John McElroy, the Raiders used various methods to get what they wanted, ranging from "sneak thievery to highway robbery". The group's most common method of stealing food and goods involved looking out for "promising subjects" in crowds of new prisoners; tricking their targets by pretending to help them find a good place to sleep; and then beating and robbing them.
Another of the Raiders' favored techniques involved sending out teams of spies to track down prisoners suspected of having valuables which could be traded to camp guards. After determining that a prisoner had something of value, the Raiders would wait for him to fall asleep and would then raid his tent. If the prisoner awoke during the robbery, the raiders would threaten him with death if he tried to resist.
The Raiders were well organized and had many members who performed a variety of tasks. It is unclear exactly how many members the group had; some sources put membership at 50, while others propose numbers as high as 500. The best estimate is that the Raiders consisted of at least 100 regular members, as well as a number of others who would do favors for the group or provide assistance in exchange for compensation.
The group was centrally organized around its six most important members, known as the "chieftains": Charles Curtis, John Sarsfield, Patrick Delaney, Teri Sullivan (or W.R. Rickson, according to other sources), William Collins, and A. Munn. According to Futch, each of the leaders had henchmen who were organized into groups named after the leaders, such as "Collins' Raiders" and "Curtis' Raiders".
As a result of their widespread thievery, the Raiders were well stocked and enjoyed considerably better living conditions than their fellow prisoners. They possessed a variety of weapons, ranging from axes to bowie knives. They were also well fed, which gave them a major advantage when it came to fighting; many of their victims were suffering from malnutrition, and consequently were considerably weaker and less able to defend themselves. In addition, for living quarters, the Raiders were able to build a tent that was large enough to fit over one hundred men, constructed mostly with stolen materials.
Given the harsh conditions, overcrowding, and scarcity of basic items needed for survival within Andersonville, the Raiders' actions often resulted in dire consequences for their victims. When the Raiders stole from a person, they would put that person at risk of dying as an indirect or direct result of the robbery. For example, according to former prisoner Warren Goss, in an autobiography of his time spent at Andersonville, the indirect effect of the Raiders "blankets from boys unaccustomed to hardships was downright murder", because the victim would then be exposed to the "chill dews of evening and the frequent rains... and was sure to sicken and die". Death could also result more directly from the Raiders' actions, as when a prisoner attempted to resist being robbed by the Raiders, and was murdered in the process. Another account of life at Andersonville describes one such occurrence: "one poor fellow came to an untimely death at their [the Raiders' hands... because he showed resistance to their inhuman attempts".
While resistance to the Raiders' actions could prove deadly, it also was sometimes effective. Victims – particularly new inmates – would often be awoken in the middle of the night with a knife to their throat, with their attackers threatening to cut their throat if they moved. Nevertheless, some victims succeeded in defending themselves from these attacks and escaping. John McElroy describes one such event, in which a young man was attacked by eleven Raiders but managed to escape by hitting one of his attackers in the head with a spade; the attacker was knocked down and his fellow Raiders retreated. It was common for the Raiders to retreat as soon as they realized a form of significant resistance was at hand.
While resistance had the potential to be successful, the camp's prisoners needed the motivation to fight the Raiders, and this proved to be a major barrier. The prisoners were suffering from widespread disease, starvation, and the effects of the other harsh conditions within the camp. In contrast to the well-fed, well-stocked, and well-organized Raiders, the prisoners' physical capabilities for resistance, and their abilities to sustain a motivated, organized resistance effort, were significantly weakened. However, by mid-June 1864, the prisoners decided that they could no longer tolerate the Raiders' terrorization and control over Andersonville in addition to the constant threats they also experienced from the camp's guards and the constant risk of death due to the conditions within the camp. They organized to bring their complaints to Confederate authorities, and they also formed an inner prison police force to defend against and capture the Raiders.
Defense against the Raiders.
The first organized resistance efforts within Andersonville involved small groups of prisoners - usually members of the same platoon or squadron – forming together in defense against the Raiders. The groups would agree that if one of their members were attacked, he would scream out an agreed-upon code word; the other members of the group would then come to the victim's defense and would scare away the attackers. For example, members of the Plymouth Squad would yell "Plymouth!" when being attacked, and all of the other members of the squad would come to their rescue. McElroy also describes a similar situation in which a victim would scream "Raiders!" and the prisoners around him would attack the robbers. However, in order to defeat the Raiders, the prisoners would have to become more organized, and would also need some sort of backing from the Confederate authorities.
On June 29, 1864, a prisoner named Dowd was beaten severely by two Raiders, and had some of his valuables (including a watch and money) stolen. After his attack, Dowd went immediately to the front gate of the prison in order to confront the Confederate guards and demand justice. His complaints caught the interest of Andersonville's head official, Captain Henry Wirz. After hearing Dowd's story, Wirz announced that he would cut off all rations until the Raiders were turned in.
As a result of Wirz's actions, an internal police force, commonly known as "the Regulators", was quickly organized within the camp. The Regulators were not new to the camp, but they became significantly more powerful after Dowd's case was brought to Captain Wirz. According to McElroy, a small band of soldiers calling themselves the Regulators had previously existed within the camp; prior to Wirz's involvement, their actions were limited to beating Raiders who attacked other prisoners. However, after Wirz became involved, permission to organize a police force was given the inmates, and the Regulators began to make arrests and hold the individuals they arrested until they were given a fair trial.
The Regulators were also given additional powers beyond the ability to arrest and hold suspects. According to the diary of a prisoner named John Ransom, Captain Wirz gave the internal police force permission to set up a court and put offenders on trial. Wirz also gave the Regulators full permission to administer any punishments they deemed necessary, from more minor penalties such as lashings or public humiliation, to death by hanging.
Arrest and punishment.
Most of the Regulators' arrests of suspected Raiders took place between June 29 and July 10, 1864, when the main offenders were tried and hanged. The Regulators were able to round up most of the Raiders by attacking them at their headquarters; while the Raiders put up considerable resistance, they were overthrown by the Regulators. In his diary, Ransom notes that the first night of arrests were successful because, "thirty or forty of the worst characters in camp had been taken outside".
Ransom also notes that it was very difficult to protect the captured Raiders from being lynched, rather than being given a fair trial as promised. Estimates of how many Raiders were arrested vary from source to source, but the number is likely to be somewhere between 75 (according to what Ransom believed) and 150 (as estimated by McElroy).
After the Raiders' arrests, as promised by Captain Wirz, the offenders were put on trial for their crimes against their fellow prisoners. The court was set up much like a typical court, including a judge and jury of the offenders' peers. Of those who were convicted by the court, many were given relatively light sentences, such as "setting in the stocks, strung up by the thumbs, thumb screws, head hanging, etc." Another of the lesser punishments was the running of the gauntlet. Those sentenced to this punishment were forced to run through a gauntlet of inmates who were given clubs and allowed to hit the offenders as they ran by. In some cases, the Raiders running the gauntlet were able to escape with just a few blows to the head, but a few were beaten so badly that they died as a result of their injuries.
While most of the convicted Raiders received non-lethal punishments, six members, who were considered the group's leaders, were given the most severe punishment: death by hanging.
The six leaders – Sarsfield, Collins, Curtis, Delaney, Munn, and Sullivan – were executed on July 11, 1864, on a set of gallows that was built that day. On the way to the gallows, Curtis escaped from his rope ties and fled, but was caught by the police and returned to the gallows. Each man was given time to say some last words before he was hanged. Munn expressed great remorse for his acts and hoped that God would show him mercy; Collins pleaded for mercy from the crowd and claimed that he was innocent; and Sarsfield gave a long speech in which he, too, expressed some regret. Delaney and Curtis, however, showed no contrition; Delaney went so far as to say that he would "rather be hanged than live here Andersonville". All six were buried separately from the rest of those who died at the camp. Their execution marked the end of the Raiders' reign over Andersonville.

Wood diesel

Wood diesel is a new biofuel which was developed by the University of Georgia from woodchips. The oil is extracted and then added to unmodified diesel engines. Either new plants are used or planted to replace the old plants. The charcoal byproduct is put back into the soil as a fertilizer. According to the director Tom Adams since carbon is put back into the soil, this biofuel can actually be carbon negative not just carbon neutral. Carbon negative decreases carbon dioxide in the air reversing the greenhouse effect not just reducing it.

Orca Bay (Alaska)

Orca Bay is a bay in Prince William Sound, Alaska.
Orca Bay is on the north west and west sides of Hawkins Island, extending westward to Johnstone Point of Hinchenbrook Island. Its northwestern corner is demarcated by Knowles Head, between Port Gravina and Fidalgo Bay on the mainland. Its eastern end can be reached from the port of Cordova, Alaska on Orca Inlet. According to the US Board on Geographic Names, Orca Bay was named for the Orca salmon cannery of the Pacific Steam Whaling Company, which operated on the southeast shore of Orca Inlet and in turn was named for that company's ship "Orca". Ultimately the name is derived from the orca or killer whale.
The bay was named Puerto Córdova by the Spanish explorer Salvador Fidalgo, in 1790, with the English name “Cordova Bay” marked on charts. It was renamed by the early twentieth century, to avoid confusion with Cordova Bay in Dixon Entrance, at the eastern extreme of the Gulf of Alaska.
The United States Navy seaplane tender USS "Orca" (AVP-49), in commission from 1944 to 1947 and from 1951 to 1960, was named for Orca Bay.

Glide (automobile)

The Glide automobile was an American automobile manufactured by the Bartholomew Company in Peoria Heights, Illinois beginning in 1902. Founded by John B. Bartholomew, the company continued to produce automobiles until 1920, when the company began manufacturing trucks for the Avery Company, of which Bartholomew was also president.
Company origins.
J. B. Bartholomew started with the Avery Company in Galesburg, Illinois on December 8, 1879 driving a team to haul lumber for a US$1.10 per day. In 1882 the Avery company purchased in Peoria, Illinois and moved the business there to North Adams and North Jefferson Streets. In 1892, Robert Avery, the president of the Avery Co., died and Bartholomew was made vice-president. 
He had for the prior ten years been in Des Moines, Iowa, managing one of the Avery Co. plants, and where he also built up a small side business, the Bartholomew Company, to manufacture popcorn and peanut roasters and wagons. Upon his return to Peoria to become vice president of the Avery Company, he continued his side business. In 1900, he moved the company's manufacturing facility to a new facility on the 300-500 block of Glide Avenue in Peoria.
Models produced.
In 1901 Batholomew began experimenting with automobile manufacturing, and in 1902 he added automobiles to the Bartholomew Company production line. Their slogan was "Ride in a Glide, Then Decide." They made a total of seven models, though never more than 500 cars in a year, and usually less. The first car was a single-cylinder tiller-steered runabout named the "Glidemobile". By 1904, they had added a steering wheel and increased the engine to . The engine was positioned horizontally under the seat, featured a single chain-drive and an optional tonneau top. The two-seater sold for US$750, and the tonneau top for US$850. About 25 were sold in 1903 and twice that in 1904.
In 1905 they introduced a 14 hp 2-cylinder engine and in 1906 a 36 hp 4-cylinder front-mounted engine. They stopped making single- and two-cylinder engines in 1906, and in 1907 they added a 50/60 hp 6-cylinder Model H. This was mounted on a wheelbase and sold for US$3500. In 1908, the company stock was worth $200,000. The cars were sold through dealers in Des Moines, New Orleans, Boston, San Francisco, New York City, Butte (Montana), Washington D.C., Indianapolis, Allegheny (Pennsylvania) and Montreal.
The Model H was made for only two years, and from 1909-1915 the cars featured a 4-cylinder, engine, shaft drive, and several bodies including roadster or tourer makes. They began offering a closed car for the first time in 1916, when they also returned to offering a 6-cylinder engine. They produced about 200 cars per year, until 1916 when this rose to about 500 autos. The new Model 6-40 offered a smaller engine than the Model H, on a wheelbase. This sold for US$1095 as a tourer body and US$1295 as a sedan. This model remained largely the same through 1920.
Absorbed into Avery Company.
In 1920, as competition from Buick and Studebaker increased, Bartholomew decided to bring the plant into the Avery Company fold and it was utilized to manufacture trucks. Avery Company employed four thousand people by this point, but went into bankruptcy and receivership in 1923. President J. B. Bartholomew died in 1924.

Terry Fallis

Terry Fallis is a Canadian writer and public relations consultant, whose debut novel "The Best Laid Plans" was awarded the Stephen Leacock Medal in 2008.
"The Best Laid Plans" is a satire of Canadian politics, in which a burned-out political strategist's plan to get out of politics by managing an unelectable candidate in a federal election in order to kill off his own credibility is thrown into turmoil when the candidate becomes unexpectedly popular with the voters. Due to lack of publisher interest, Fallis originally released excerpts from the novel in podcast format, later turning to the print-on-demand company iUniverse to self-publish a paper edition. The podcast was subsequently picked up for broadcast on Radioropa.
Following his award win, Fallis signed with McClelland & Stewart, which republished "The Best Laid Plans" through its Douglas Gibson Books imprint in September 2008. A sequel novel, "The High Road", was published by Douglas Gibson Books in September 2010 and was a finalist for the 2011 Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour. His third novel, again published by M&S, "Up and Down", debuted on "The Globe and Mail" Bestsellers list in September 2012. It was a finalist for the 2013 Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour and won the 2013 Ontario Library Association Evergreen Award. McClelland & Stewart will publish his fourth novel, "No Relation", in May 2014.
"The Best Laid Plans" also won the 2011 edition of "Canada Reads" as the "essential Canadian novel of the decade", where it was defended by journalist Ali Velshi. In 2013, CBC Television announced plans to adapt the novel into a six-part television series, "The Best Laid Plans", which debuted in January 2014. "The Best Laid Plans" is also in development as a stage musical by Touchstone Theatre in Vancouver.
In June 2013, Fallis won the Libris Award for Author of the Year presented by the Canadian Booksellers Association.
Fallis is himself a former Liberal Party strategist, who has worked on the campaign and legislative staffs of Jean Chrétien, Jean Lapierre, Robert Nixon and Michael Ignatieff. In 1995, he co-founded Thornley Fallis, a public relations and social/digital media agency with offices in Toronto and Ottawa.

<doc id="20302955" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20302955" title="Loch Alsh">
Loch Alsh

Loch Alsh or Lochalsh (from the Scottish Gaelic "Loch Aillse", "foaming lake") is a sea inlet between the isle of Skye in the Inner Hebrides and the Northwest Highlands of Scotland. The name is also used to described the surrounding country and the feudal holdings around the loch. The area is rich in history, and is increasingly popular with tourists.
The hilly country around Loch Alsh has a temperate, well-watered climate. There is some pasture and woodland, but much of the area is moorland. The rocks are ancient Precambrian Gneiss, some of the oldest in the world, much eroded.
The earliest known inhabitants were Picts, but in the late 6th century Loch Alsh became part of the Gaelic island kingdom of Dál Riata. Between the 8th and 13th centuries the area was disputed between the kingdoms of Norway and Alba and often ruled by independent lords. Although nominally subject to the Kingdom of Scotland after 1266 AD, the history of the region until the failed rebellion of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745 is one of obscure struggles between the local clans and against the central government.
To prevent further feuds and rebellions, in 1746 the government enacted laws designed to break the bond between the clan leaders and their people. An indirect result was gradual conversion of the land from crofting to more profitable and less labour intensive sheep farming. These Highland Clearances and the subsequent Highland Potato Famine of 1846–52 forced many of the people to emigrate. Today, the area is thinly populated with an economy based mainly on tourism.
Location.
The loch runs inland about from Kyle of Lochalsh to Ardelve. From there Loch Duich continues southeast another 10 km to Shiel Bridge while Loch Long runs deeper into the mountains to the northeast. A narrow strait from the south of Loch Alsh leads to the Sound of Sleat that separates the Isle of Skye from the mainland. The loch is overlooked by Sgurr na Coinnich, which rises to on Skye. The mainland hills to the north reach at the summit of Auchtertyre Hill and on Sgurr Mor but are generally lower and slope gradually down to the west.
The ancient stronghold of Inverness is to the east as a crow flies over the Northwest Highlands.
The climate is temperate. Annual rainfall is around 2.3 metres per year and temperatures range from 0–7 °C in January to 10–18 °C in July and August. On any given day of the year rain is more likely than not. Much of the countryside is moorland or pasture but there are lowland areas of deciduous forest with native birchwoods and oakwoods and some conifer plantations. At one time the forest would have been more extensive, but the early inhabitants converted parts of it to crofts (small farms) and when the Highland Clearances destroyed the crofts the land was kept as pasture.
Geology.
The loch lies between hills just east of the Moine Thrust Belt, an unusual geological structure that runs from the Sleat peninsula in Skye on a northeast diagonal to Loch Eriboll on the north coast of Scotland. In this area, geologists found in 1907 that younger rocks from the west lay below the older rocks of the east, a discovery that helped lead to the modern theory of mountain building. The Lewisian gneisses around Loch Alsh were formed in the Precambrian period, about 2800 million years ago, while the volcanic rocks, gabbro and granite that make up most of Skye, and that in some places lie under the older gneisses, are just 55 million years old. The ancient metamorphic rocks around Loch Alsh have been heavily eroded over the years, most recently by a series of ice ages.
Fauna.
In 2012, a large colony of flame shells were discovered in the loch following a Marine Scotland commissioned survey, carried out by Heriot-Watt University. The reef is thought to consist of over 100 million flame shells covering , making it the largest known reef of its kind in the UK.
People.
Records from Roman times describe the people of the area as Picts, a Celtic people. Pictish brochs, tall stone towers up to ten meters high and more than 2,000 years old, are found near Glenelg to the south of the loch. The Scots, a tribe of Gaels from Ireland, established the kingdom of Dál Riata in the Hebrides and western Scotland late in the 6th century, and their Gaelic language gradually replaced the earlier Pictish language. Many of the local people speak Gaelic to this day.
In the 7th and 8th centuries the area suffered raids and invasions by Vikings from Norway. From the 9th century until the Treaty of Perth in 1266 CE control of the Hebrides alternated between the kingdoms of Norway and of Alba to the east, and independent Gaelic/Scandinavian rulers such as Ketil Flatnose, Maccus mac Arailt, Godred Crovan and Somerled. The kingdom of Scotland that finally established its authority over the area included many lowlanders who spoke a Northumbrian language akin to English. However, it was only gradually and comparatively recently that Scottish English became more common than Gaelic in the Lochalsh area.
The people of Lochalsh are thus a combination of Pictish and Scottish (Irish) with Norwegian and English elements.
History.
Feudal period.
The history of Lochalsh from its nominal acquisition by the Kingdom of Scotland in 1266 CE until the rebellion of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745 is one of obscure struggles between the local clans and against the central government.
The Norse Clan MacLeod and Clan MacDonald on Skye, and the Celtic Clan Mackenzie with their stronghold in the castle of Eilean Donan at the head of the loch retained a large degree of independence for centuries. Often the MacDonald Lord of the Isles acted as a sovereign in alliance with the Scottish king rather than a subject. Thus Alexander of Islay, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles allied himself with King James I of Scotland against the Albany Stewarts in 1424, but in 1429 went to war against the king. Although defeated and forced to surrender, his authority in the Hebrides and western highlands was such that he remained a leading power in the kingdom. Alexander's bastard sons Uisdean (Hugh of Sleat) and Gilleasbaig ("Celestine") were given Sleat and Lochalsh respectively.
Clan Matheson, led by the McRuari descendents of Somerled, were another power in the area, participating in the battle of Largs in 1263 when King Haakon IV of Norway was defeated, and later fighting for Donald of the Isles at the battle of Harlaw in 1411 against an army commanded by Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. Later, as a result of a feud with Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, clan Matheson switched allegiance to the Mackenzies. John Dubh was killed in 1539 while defending Eilean Donan Castle against Macdonald of Sleat. After this, the power of the clan declined although they retained property in Lochalsh and in Sutherland. Sir James Matheson of Sutherland was founder of the trading house of Jardine Matheson Holdings in the Far East. A Matheson still holds the title of Baronet of Lochalsh.
The MacDonald of Lochalsh branch was founded by Celestine MacDonald (d.1476), second son of Alexander of Islay, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles. In 1491 Alexander MacDonald of Lochalsh joined Clan Cameron in a raid into Ross where they fought with Clan MacKenzie of Kintail, advanced east to Badenoch where they were joined by the Clan Mackintosh, and then to Inverness where they took Inverness Castle. In 1495, threatened by King James's army, most of the highland chiefs submitted. However, soon after Sir Alexander MacDonald again rebelled and invaded Ross-shire, where he was defeated in battle by Clan Munro and Clan MacKenzie at Drumchatt. He escaped to the Isles but was caught on Oransay and put to death.
In 1580 a feud started between the Mackenzies and the Macdonells of Glengarry. The Chief of Glengarry had inherited part of Lochalsh, Lochcarron, and Lochbroom, while the father of Colin Cam Mackenzie of Kintail, a favourite of king James VI, had acquired the other part by purchase. Colin Cam MacKenzie took MacDonell prisoner and murdered his three uncles. The Privy Council investigated the matter and caused Strome Castle, which Macdonell yielded to Mackenzie as one of the conditions of his release, to be placed under the custody of the Earl of Argyll. MacKenzie of Kintail was briefly detained at Edinburgh, but shortly after pardoned by the king. His son Kenneth Mackenzie (c.1569–1611) successfully continued the bloody feud with the Macdonells of Glengarry and secured the entire island of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. Kenneth's son Colin Mackenzie (1596/7-1633) became 1st Earl of Seaforth, with vast estates and wealth.
Calvinists and Jacobites.
Broader changes were to profoundly affect the traditional life of the clans. In 1560, inspired by John Knox, the Scottish Parliament abolished the jurisdiction of the pope in Scotland, condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and forbade the celebration of Mass. Many in the west and the islands resisted these changes, and continued to adhere to the Roman Catholic faith. In 1603 the crowns of England and Scotland were united when James VI became king James I of England. The English Revolution of 1640–1660 destroyed forever the principle of the absolute power of monarchs, and the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 ensured that no Catholic could hold the crown. In 1714, the elector of Hanover succeeded Queen Anne to become George I of Great Britain.
A Jacobite rising broke out in 1715 in an attempt to place Queen Anne's half-brother James on the throne. The Pretender's supporters led by Lord Mar instigated rebellion in Scotland. The rising was a dismal failure and collapsed by the end of the year. In 1719, Philip V of Spain lent support to a fresh attempt to restore the Stuart dynasty. He lent ships, troops and guns to George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal, landing him on the Isle of Lewis to raise troops. On 13 April 1719, Keith's men disembarked near Lochalsh, although the Highlanders did not join in the expected numbers. Keith could not proceed to Inverness as planned, and established his headquarter in the castle of Eilean Donan. The bulk of his army moved south to Glen Shiel, a few miles south of the head of Loch Duich. On 10 May, three ships of the Royal Navy arrived off the castle which they captured and destroyed. On 10 June 1719 at the Battle of Glen Shiel the Jacobites were defeated by an army of English and Scottish soldiers dispatched from Inverness. Yet another rising led by Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) in 1745-6 had more success, but collapsed when his Scottish soldiers refused to proceed from Derby to London. Prince Charlie was forced to flee, taking refuge on Skye for some time before escaping to the continent. There were no further challenges to the Hanoverian kings.
The Clearances and later events.
The Jacobite risings resulted in laws that prohibited possession of swords and the wearing of tartans or kilts, ended the feudal bond of military service and removed the virtually sovereign power the chiefs had over their clan. The clan leaders became no more than wealthy landowners. Increasing demand in Britain for cattle and sheep, and the creation of new breeds of sheep which could be reared in the mountainous country, allowed higher rents to meet the costs of an aristocratic lifestyle. As a result, many families living on a subsistence level were displaced, emigrating in large numbers to Canada and elsewhere. Unrest was suppressed by troops where needed. The highland clearances continued steadily from 1762 onwards. Chiefs who once had been responsible for the welfare of their people became rich while the land was depopulated, a process that accelerated with the Highland Potato Famine of 1846–52 CE.
After the clearances, the greatly reduced population was employed in sheep raising, fishing, kelp gathering and weaving. The romantic but bloody days of clan warfare were a thing of the past. Although one of the poorest parts of Britain, conditions gradually improved. In 1897 the Highland Railway opened the Kyle of Lochalsh Line, connecting to the Skye ferry.
During World War II, Loch Alsh was a British naval base. On 26 November 1940 the mine layer HMS "Port Napier" dragged her anchor during a gale and sank in the Kyle of Loch Alsh. The wreck remains and may be visited by scuba divers.
In 1995 the Skye Bridge across the Kyle of Lochalsh was opened, connecting Skye to the mainland and causing the ferry to close. The use of tolls to recover the cost of building the bridge was the subject of much controversy.
Lochalsh today.
Until recently part of Skye and Lochalsh, Lochalsh is now part of the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer & Lochalsh ward of the Highland Council. The entire ward had a population of just 11,454 in 2006. The population is healthy, well-educated, growing very slowly and ageing. As of August 2003 the unemployment rate was 2.7%. Tourism is now central to the economy. The wholesale, hotels & restaurants sector is the largest employer with 26.8% of the workforce, followed closely by the Public Administration, Education & Health sector.
There are many attractions in the area for tourists, including hiking trails of varying levels of difficulty through magnificent scenery, boat trips, sea fishing, scuba diving and visits to the ruined Pictish brochs and later castles that remain from the region's turbulent past. The local food is generally simple but very high in quality.

The Monk by the Sea

The Monk by the Sea () is an oil painting by the German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich. It was painted between 1808 and 1810 in Dresden and was first shown together with the painting "The Abbey in the Oakwood" ("Abtei im Eichwald") in the Berlin Academy exhibition of 1810. On Friedrich's request "The Monk by the Sea" was hung above "The Abbey in the Oakwood".
After the exhibition both pictures were bought by king Frederick Wilhelm III for his collection. Today the paintings hang side by side in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin.
For its lack of concern with creating the illusion of depth—which had been a traditional aspect of landscape painting—"The Monk by the Sea" was Friedrich's most radical composition. The broad expanses of sea and sky emphasize the meager figure of the monk, standing before the vastness of nature and the presence of God.
Development.
A single figure, dressed in a long garment and with his chin on one hand, stands on a low dune sprinkled with grass. The figure, usually identified as a monk, has turned almost completely away from the viewer and surveys a rough sea and a gray, blank sky that takes up about three quarters of the picture. It is unclear whether he is standing on a high rock or only on a gentle slope to the sea. The dune forms an inexpressive triangle in the composition, at the farthest point of which is the figure. Contrasting with the dark ocean there are several whitecaps of waves sometimes mistaken for seagulls.
Although Friedrich's paintings are landscapes, he designed and painted them in his studio, using freely drawn plein air sketches, from which he chose the most evocative elements to integrate into an expressive composition. The composition of "The Monk by the Sea" shows evidence of this reductive process, as Friedrich removed elements from the canvas after they were painted. Recent scientific investigations have revealed that he had initially painted two small sailing ships on the horizon, which he later removed. Friedrich continued to modify the details of the painting right up to its exhibition—to the sky's grey was added blue, with stars and a moon—but the basic composition always stayed the same.
The picture appeared at a time when Friedrich had his first public success and critical acknowledgment with his controversial "Tetschener Altar", a work that explicitly fused the landscape format with a religious theme. "The Monk by the Sea" furthered his success and drew much attention.
Friedrich probably began the painting in Dresden, 1808. In a letter of February 1809, he described the image for the first time. The stages in its conception were also documented by guests to his studio. In June 1809, the wife of painter Gerhard von Kügelgen, an acquaintance of Friedrich, visited him and later criticized the painting in a letter; she was put off by the loneliness of the setting and the lack of consolation that movement or narrative might provide the "unending space of air". 
Art historian Albert Boime believed that the figure of the monk was Friedrich, walking on the cliffs at Rügen, which would place the subject near the site where a Protestant mystic built a chapel for poor fishermen who were far from home and wished to profess their faith. The identification of the monk as a self-portrait has been accepted by other scholars, both for physical resemblances to Friedrich (the long blond hair and round skull), and for the fact that, in keeping with the perception of artists as belonging to a "higher priesthood", Friedrich later painted himself in a monk's clothing.
Reception.
The painting was exhibited in its current form at the Berlin Academy in October 1810, to much controversy and criticism. The composition notably lacks a repoussoir—a framing device that leads the viewer's gaze into the image. Rather, the emptiness of the foreground is overwhelming. It is commonly argued that a viewer of this painting has difficulty relating himself to the picture's space. One cannot mentally "penetrate" the image: Friedrich has created an unbridgeable gap between the monk and the viewer. The monk is cut off from us spatially and existentially, and there are no traditional landscape elements that might soften the effect—only a cold sky and a flat foreground, void of greenery, and a dark sea, reduced to a narrow band on which no vessels sail. Friedrich has compressed space in a manner anticipating abstract art; "The Monk by the Sea" has been described as "perhaps the first 'abstract' painting in a very modern sense". 
In the month of the exhibition, German Romantic author Clemens Brentano submitted an article on the painting to the "Berliner Abendblätter", a new daily journal edited by his friend Heinrich von Kleist. The piece, titled "Different Feelings about a Seascape by Friedrich on which is a Capuchin Monk", was critical of the work, but Kleist substantially revised Brentano's text to produce an article sympathetic to Friedrich's painting. Kleist's commentary has become a central element in discussion of the painting and of Friedrich; the two men are seen as at odds with the aesthetic of the more conventional German Romantics, in which Brentano was firmly entrenched.
Kleist wrote, for example:
How wonderful it is to sit completely alone by the sea under an overcast sky, gazing out over the endless expanse of water. It is essential that one has come there just for this reason, and that one has to return. That one would like to go over the sea but cannot; that one misses any sign of life, and yet one senses the voice of life in the rush of the water, in the blowing of the wind, in the drifting of the clouds, in the lonely cry of the birds ... No situation in the world could be more sad and eerie than this—as the only spark of life in the wide realm of death, a lonely center in a lonely circle... Nevertheless, this definitively marks a totally new departure in Friedrich's art...
More famously, Kleist also wrote, "since in its monotony and boundlessness it has no foreground except the frame, when viewing it, it is as if one's eyelids had been cut away."
Influence.
"The Monk by the Sea" inspired responses from painters like Gustave Courbet and James Abbott McNeill Whistler later in the 19th century. In works such as Gustave Courbet's "The Coast Near Palavas" a lone figure is depicted as a seeker, similarly exposed and looking out to sea.
Friedrich, though a Romantic painter, had a significant influence on later Symbolist and Expressionist artists. Franz Marc's "Horse in a Landscape" (1910) has been described as formally similar to "The Monk by the Sea". Although their use of colour is at two extremes, both paintings are compositionally simple, with undulating horizontals and a figure that looks out at the same scene as the viewer. In his 1961 article "The Abstract Sublime", the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes "The Monk by the Sea", Turner's "The Evening Star" and Rothko's 1954 "Light, Earth and Blue" as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, "Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us on the threshold of those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail—a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape—is no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night." From the 1960s on, Gotthard Graubner's picture-size coloured cushions or "color-space bodies" were also inspired by Friedrich's "The Monk by the Sea". According to art historian Werner Hofmann, both Graubner and Friedrich created an aesthetics of monotony as a counterpart to the aesthetics of variety that was predominant before the nineteenth century.

Chlosyne gorgone

The Gorgone Checkerspot (Chlosyne gorgone) is a species of Nymphalinae that occurs in North America.
Description.
The wingspan is between 32 and 45 mm. The dorsal side of the wings are orange with black markings and the hindwings have a submarginal row of solid black dots. The ventral view has a zigzag pattern of brown and white bands with a median band of white chevrons.
Range and habitat.
The Gorgone Checkerspot's range consists of Alberta east to southern Ontario, south into central Texas, between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachians. Within its range they can most commonly be seen in open areas including ridges, prairies and old fields. They can also be seen at streamsides and in open hardwood forests.
Life cycle.
In the northern range there is one brood between July and August, two in the mid-range between May and September and three in the southern range between April and September. The females lay their eggs in clusters on the underside of their host plants. Early instar caterpillars feed in groups and 3rd instar caterpillars hibernate.

Azelinini

__NOTOC__
The Azelinini are a tribe of geometer moths in the subfamily Ennominae, with many species in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in South America. Several species are found in North America as well. These stocky geometer moths seem to be closely related to other robust tribes, such as the Campaeini, Ennomini, Lithinini and Nacophorini – all of which might warrant to be subsumed in the Ennomini –, the genus "Odontopera", and perhaps the Caberini and Colotoini.
Description.
They rest with their wings stetched out parallel to the surface, and the hindwings hidden under the forewings unlike most related Ennominae. Though they are among the larger Geometridae, they are nonetheless not very conspicuous; the outer third of the forewings is usually conspicuously lighter than the middle third, and at the apical end of the forewing cell there is usually a white or black spot, altogether very much reminiscent of the Ennomini's pattern.
At least some Azelinini lack the sensillae at the end of the adults' antennae found in most geometer moths. The foreleg tarsi are relatively short, as in many of their relatives. The hindwing veins Sc and R1 are extensively fused in some Azelinini, reminding of the Larentiini which are not very closely related. The characteristic comb of transverse setae on the underside of the males' abdominal segment A3, found in many Ennominae, is apparently absent in the Azelinini, as is the associated "scent-brush" on the hindleg tibiae.
The male genital's valvae usually have complex autapomorphic modifications (such as a hypertrophied ampulla and gnathos) in this tribe, but the valvula, like in their relatives, is not distally expanded. Unusually, they have both an elongated uncus and well-developed socii;, the sacculus is rarely hairy and the saccus' vinculum is generally neither extended nor recurved. Some Azelilini, perhaps all, completely lack the cornuti (spines) on the vesica of the aedeagus usually found in Lepidoptera.
Of the female genitalia, the ovipostor is narrow. A robust funnel-shaped antrum – the foremost part of the ostium bursae – is present and the interior of the corpus bursae is studded with small spines, while the ductus bursae is delicate and not sclerotized much.
Like the Nacophorini, their caterpillars have many setae on the (vestigial) prolegs of abdominal segment A6. And like the Ennomini and Nacophorini, their pupae have antennal tubercles. The chorion cell walls of their eggs are visibly reticulated only around the micropyle.
Selected genera.
As numerous ennomine genera have not yet been assigned to a tribe, the genus list is preliminary.
"Oratha", usually placed in the Nacophorini, might also belong here.

Long metre

Long Metre or Long Measure, abbreviated L.M. or LM, is a poetic metre consisting of four line stanzas, or quatrains, in iambic tetrameter with alternate rhyme pattern "a-b-a-b". The term is also used in the closely related area of hymn metres. When the poem is used as a sung hymn, the metre of the text is denoted by the syllable count of each line; for long metre, the count is denoted by 8.8.8.8, 88.88, or 88 88, depending on style. It is similar to common metre (for poems or melodies denoted as 8.6.8.6, 86.86, or 88 86) which consists of four lines in alternating iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter.
History.
Poets have utilized long metre for more than a thousand years: the hymn "Te lucis ante terminum" is known from a hymnary of the eighth or early ninth century, and might be even older. The same metre is also found in more recent works: Psalm 100, "All People That on Earth Do Dwell", is sometimes sung to an arrangement of the calypso tune used in "Jamaica Farewell", and the song "Hernando's Hideaway" from "The Pajama Game" is also largely in long metre; "Jimmy Crack Corn" is in long metre, with frequent metric variations, but the refrain is in 88 86.

Geology of the North Sea

The geology of the North Sea describes the geological features such as channels, trenches, and ridges today and the geological history, plate tectonics, and geological events that created them.
The basement of the North Sea was formed in an intraplate setting during the Precambrian. Rigid blocks were overlaid with various depositions, sands and salts. These rigid blocks were transformed to a metamorphic base due to tectonic processes such as continental collisions which cause horizontal pressure, friction and distortion in the Caledonian plate cycle as well as the Variscan plate cycle. The blocks were also subjected to metamorphic evolution during the Triassic and Jurassic periods when the rock was heated up by the intrusion of hot molten rock called magma from the Earth's interior.
The Caledonian (Iapetus) plate cycle saw the formation of the Iapetus suture during the Caledonian orogeny. The Iapetus suture was a major weakness creating a volcanic fault in the central North Sea during the later Jurassic period. The Iapetus ocean was replaced with a suture line and mountain range when Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia continents collided. This collision formed Laurussia.
The Variscan (Rheic) plate cycle resulted in the formation of Pangea when Gondwana and Laurussia collided. The elimination of the Rheic Ocean caused the formation of a massive mountain range through the border countries of the present day North Sea.
Triassic and Jurassic volcanic rifting and graben fault systems created highs and lows in the North Sea area. This was followed by late Mesozoic and Cenozoic subsidence creating the intracratonic sedimentary basin of the North Sea. This era experienced higher sea levels because of sea floor spreading, cooler lithosphere temperatures. Plate tectonics and continental orogenies combined to create the continents and the North Sea as we know them today. The final events affecting the North Sea coastline features and submarine topography occurred in the Cenozoic era.
Tectonic structure.
The Mesozoic structures underneath the North Sea can be seen as a failed rift system. After initial crustal extension and the formation of rift basins during the Triassic and Jurassic periods, the extension concentrated on the other side of the British Isles, which would create the northern Atlantic Ocean. The rift basins even saw some inversion during the late Cretaceous and Eocene epochs. From the Oligocene onward, tensions in the European crust caused by the Alpine orogeny to the south cause a new, more modest phase of extension. Some grabens in the area are still active.
The subsurface of the North Sea area is dominated by grabens: the north-west south-east oriented Lower Rhine Graben under the southern North Sea and the Netherlands, the north-south oriented North Sea Central Graben that begins north of the Dutch coast and ends in the region east of Scotland, and the Viking Graben along the south-east Norwegian coast. The Horn Graben is a smaller graben east of the Central Graben and in front of the Danish coast. Another smaller structure is known as the Terschelling Graben which borders the Central Graben in the West, just North of the Netherlands. A larger graben is found in the subsurface below the Skagerrak, this north-south structure is called the Bamble-Oslo Graben. The Viking Graben is separated from the Faeroe Shetland Basin below the Atlantic by the Shetland Platform, the two structures join in the area north-east of the Shetland Islands.
Precambrian.
The Precambrian is divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons. The Precambrian supereon spans from the formation of Earth around 4567 Ma (million years ago) to c. 542 Ma.
The area we now call the North Sea was interspersed amid several separate continental areas (Siberia, Baltica, Gondwana, and Laurentia) as well as the Iapetus Ocean and Tornquist Sea. Plate tectonics and continental collisions (orogenies) brought the features together of the North Sea that we recognise presently.
Finnmarkian, Athollian, Caledonian Orogenies.
The Phanerozoic is divided into three eras: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. The Paleozoic era spanned from roughly (ICS, 2004), and is subdivided into six geologic periods; from oldest to youngest they are: the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian.
The Finnmarkian orogeny affected northern Norway in the early Palaeozoic era. In the late Ordovician period, Avalonia collided with Baltica creating the Tornquist Margin. This corresponds to the suture of the north German-Polish Caledonides. By the end of the Ordovician the Tornquist Sea had been eliminated. The Tornquist-Tesseyre fault system also had its beginnings in the orogeny closing the Tornquist Sea. Baltica subducted below Avalonia.
The Atthollian Orogeny was a collision between the Scottish Highlands and a Midland Valley area which very likely created the Highland Boundary Fault.
During the late Silurian period Baltica then collided with Laurentia which is named the Scandian phase of the Caledonian Orogeny. Baltica was subducted below Laurentia forming the Caledonian Belt. The Caledonian Orogeny caused the closure of the Iapetus Ocean when the continents and terranes of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia collided. The combined mass of the three continents formed a "new" continent: Laurussia or Euramerica. The Caledonian orogeny encompasses events that occurred from the Ordovician to Early Devonian, roughly 490–390 Ma. The basement formations of the North Sea were roughly formed during this Caledonian geosynclinal stage of the Cambrian - Devonian periods. The Caledonian mountains range helped create the ‘Old Red Sandstone’ continent at the joining of the tectonic plates. The Rheic Ocean began to open to the south.
Acadian Orogeny.
The Acadian orogeny occurred in the Lower Devonian period (Paleozoic era), about 500 Ma. The continents of Laurentia and Baltica collided. The Iapetus Ocean disappeared under this continental collision. These plate tectonic forces built up a mountain range extending from what is now termed the Adirondacks north through Nova Scotia, the British Isles, Norway and the eastern margin of Greenland. Greenland and Scandinavia were situated at the amid the equator and mid tropics (20 to 20 degrees north). The area now comprising Greenland-Scandinavia-British Isles began drifting northward in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian period. A high amount of volatile magmatism caused dikes parallel to the Tornquist Margin which were formative areas of the North Sea - British Isles -Germany - southwest Sweden area.
Variscan Orogeny.
The Rheic Ocean or Proto-Tethys Ocean was eliminated during the Hercynian/Variscan orogeny, and the Pangea supercontinent formed. The continents of Gondwana and Laurussia collided, both were drifting north, however Gondwana was drifting at a faster rate. The mountain range which was created extended along Spain, Brittany, central Germany and into Poland. The closure of the Rheic Ocean in the late Carboniferous formed thrusts in southern England.
The Pangea Supercontinent was added to in the late Permian period when Siberia collided with Baltica and Kazakhstan. Pangea was surrounded by massive subduction plate tectonics. The North Sea area was central to the continental Pangea Supercontinent. In this period the area now named the North Sea was in the subtropics and was a non-marine arid environment.
Permo-Triassic rifting and thermal subsidence.
The Mesozoic era consisted of the Triassic (251.0 Ma to 199.6 Ma); Jurassic (199.6 Ma to 145.5 Ma) and Cretaceous (145.5 Ma to Ma) periods.
During the Triassic period, the Viking and Central Graben volcanic systems were formed. Upward thrusting rifts were formed during the Triassic comprising the taphrogenic stage. The Atlantic rift zone is associated with the North Sea rifts zone. The Triassic saw active crustal stretching via the rifting process, lower sea levels and volcanic activity.
Jurassic.
As the Jurassic (200–145 Ma) started, Pangaea began to break up into two continents, Gondwana and Laurasia. At this time sea levels rose. The burial of algae and bacteria below the mud of the sea floor during this time resulted in the formation of North Sea oil and natural gas, much of it trapped in overlying sandstone by deposits formed as the seas fell to form the swamps and salty lakes and lagoons that were home to dinosaurs.
Middle Jurassic domal uplift.
Volcanism and a rift system developed in the central North Sea area where basaltic lavas were extruded. The mantle warped upwards creating a dome in the middle of the North Sea where the Iapetus Suture intersected the Tornquist-Teisseyre fault system. The dome area was amidst the Viking Graben, Central Graben and Moray Firth Basin. The Scotland rifting and the extrusive centre of the Forties were associated with the uplifted area. The Long Forties and Horda Basin were also volcanic centres. During this time the sea level fell. Major reservoirs were created in the North sea during this time as clastics and sands were deposited in paralic environments.
Cretaceous period sea floor spreading.
The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system from around to Ma.
The main rift expansion was in an east and west direction. There are two basins the large South Permian Basin, and the smaller Northern Permian basin, which are east-west trending. The basins are separated by the Ringkøbing-Fyn system of highs.. The Viking Graben lies between the Shetland Platform and the Fenno-Scandian high. The Central Graben lies amid the Permian basins and their high. The formation of these has been influenced by the zig zag suture line of the Caledonian orogeny with its areas of crustal tension weakness. Sea floor expansion continues, and sea levels rise. The sea level is to higher than present day levels.
In northwestern Europe, chalk deposits from the Upper Cretaceous are characteristic for the Chalk Group, which forms the white cliffs of Dover on the south coast of England and similar cliffs on the French Normandian coast. The group is found in England, northern France, the low countries, northern Germany, Denmark and in the subsurface of the southern part of the North Sea. Stagnation of deep sea currents in middle Cretaceous times caused anoxic circumstances in the sea water. In many places around the world, dark anoxic shales were formed during this interval. These shales are an important source rock for oil and gas, for example in the subsurface of the North Sea. Across the north central and northern North Sea, the Chalk Group is a major seal unit, overlying a number of blocks of reservoir rocks and preventing their fluid contents from migrating upwards.
The Silverpit crater, a diameter suspected impact crater in the North Sea The age of the feature is constrained between 74 – 45 million years (Late Cretaceous – Eocene).</ref> The Sole Pit Basin was created by deep burial of depocentres.
Cenozoic era intracratonic basin formation.
The Cenozoic era covers the period from Ma and is still ongoing. It comprises the Quaternary, the Paleogene and Neogene periods. Geologically, the Cenozoic is the era when the continents moved into their current positions. The Alpine Orogeny, the spreading of the Mid Atlantic ridge, and the creation of the Atlantic Ocean basin occurred in the Cenozoic era. The Iceland hot spot and North Atlantic rifting helped to exhume the British Isles. In the early Palaeogene period (Caenozoic Era) between 63 and 52 Ma, the North Sea formed, and Britain was uplifted. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before.
The post rift phase followed late Jurassic rift events during the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic thermal subsidence. As the rifting stopped, then regional subsidence occurred creating an intracratonic sedimentary basin. Subsidence occurred due to lithosphere cooling. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before. Intraplate compression was caused when the Atlantic Ocean basin formed. the Mid-Atlantic spreading ridge has been busy separating east from west. Greenland separated from North America and the rifting altered direction during the Paleogene, which caused Northern Europe to separate from Greenland. During the Eocene period, the last land bridge across the Atlantic sank.
The Alpine Orogeny that took place about 50 Ma was responsible for the shaping of the London Basin syncline and the Weald anticline to the south. The eastern end of the London Basin merges with the basin of the North Sea, extending on land along the north Kent coast to Reculver and up the east coast of Essex and into Suffolk, where it is overlain by Pleistocene 'Crag' deposits which cover much of eastern Suffolk and Norfolk and are better considered as part of the North Sea basin.
In the Miocene and Pliocene epochs of the Neogene period, further uplift and erosion occurred, particularly in the Pennines. Plant and animal types developed into their modern forms, and by about 2 Ma the landscape would have been broadly recognisable today.
Ice Age.
The Pleistocene saw the sea retreat from the basin as global sea-level fell due to accumulation of ice sheets. The major changes during the Pleistocene epoch have been brought about by several recent ice ages. During glaciation, water was taken from the oceans to form the ice at high latitudes, causing global sea level to drop by about 120 meters, exposing the continental shelves and forming land-bridges between land-masses for animals to migrate. During deglaciation, the melted ice-water returned to the oceans, causing sea level to rise. This process can cause sudden shifts in coastlines and hydration systems resulting in newly submerged lands, emerging lands, collapsed ice dams resulting in salination of lakes, new ice dams creating vast areas of freshwater, and a general alteration in regional weather patterns on a large but temporary scale. It can even cause temporary reglaciation. This type of chaotic pattern of rapidly changing land, ice, saltwater and freshwater has been proposed as the likely model for the Baltic and Scandinavian regions, as well as much of central North America at the end of the last glacial maximum LGM, with the present-day coastlines only being achieved in the last few millennia of prehistory. Also, the effect of elevation on Scandinavia submerged a vast continental plain that had existed under much of what is now the North Sea, connecting the British Isles to Continental Europe.
At one time there was land where the strait is now, a south-east extension of the Weald joining what is now Great Britain to continental Europe. The Strait of Dover opened during the Ice Age, as described below; as a result the British Isles have now become islands not connected with continental Europe any longer. The English Channel was formed by erosion caused by two major floods. The first was about 425,000 years ago, when an ice-dammed lake in the southern North Sea overflowed and broke the Weald-Artois chalk range in a catastrophic erosion and flood event. Afterwards, the Thames and Scheldt flowed through the gap into the English Channel, but the Meuse and Rhine still flowed northwards. In a second flood about 225,000 years ago the Meuse and Rhine were ice-dammed into a lake that broke catastrophically through a high weak barrier (perhaps chalk, or end-moraines left by the ice sheet). Both floods cut massive flood channels in the dry bed of the English Channel, somewhat like the Channeled Scablands in the USA.
Glaciation had an enormous impact on the coastline of the North Sea. The west coast of Denmark is notable as it had been very glaciated during the Saale Glacial Stage and Weichsel glaciation. As the sea levels fell in the Holocene epoch, Denmark's north coast gave way to raised spits, beach ridges and cliffs.
During the glacial maximum in Scandinavia regionally referred to as the Weichsel glaciation, only the western parts of Jutland were ice-free, and a large part of what is today the North Sea was dry land connecting Jutland with Britain. It is also in Denmark that the only Scandinavian ice-age animals older than 13,000 BC are found. In the period following the last interglacial before the current one (Eemian Stage), the coast of Norway was also ice-free. The Baltic Sea, with its unique brackish water, is a result of meltwater from the Weichsel glaciation combining with saltwater from the North Sea when the straits between Sweden and Denmark opened. The North Sea produces fossils from every period of the Pleistocene. The area was a dry steppe landscape, overlain with rivers, where animals such as the elephant-like mastodon, scimitar cat, southern mammoth, hippopotamus, horses, bears and giant deer lived. They were flooded at the close of the last Ice Age.

Vietnamese enclaves such as those labeled as "Little Vietnam" have differing political leanings depending on whether it is one that exists in the "western" countries versus those that exist in the former Soviet-bloc. "Little Saigon", a term that is associated specifically with the Vietnamese enclaves in the United States are typically anti-communist, whereas, "Little Hanoi", a term that is associated with those Vietnamese enclaves in the former Soviet-bloc have their origins from the Communist era. This was made apparent when a Vietnamese-American video store owner named Truong Van Tran caused controversial stir when he displayed in his store a portrait of Vietnamese communist revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh. In the former East Germany, the Little Vietnam "... on the eastern side sought to bolster its workforce with unskilled Gastarbeiter, or 'guest workers', to help build socialism on German soil."
Separated communities and high poverty.
Vietnamese enclaves in the United States tend to live in separated communities according to a study Brown University. According to the study, the Vietnamese tend to stay separated from white Americans as much as African Americans are separated from Hispanic whites. The same study also found that among Asian Americans, the Vietnamese have the highest rate of poverty.
Grocery stores and restaurants.
Many Vietnamese enclaves will have numerous Asian supermarkets and Vietnamese restaurants. For example, Madison Heights, Michigan's Little Vietnam supposedly started with a nail supply stores, which then expanded to a full service Vietnamese grocery store selling everything from Vietnamese DVDs to Chinese herbs. The article further states that a Vietnamese restaurant was then opened by students at a nearby university, which then accounted for "... full 55% of such restaurants located in Metro Detroit." 
Locations.
Americas.
Little Saigon (US).
In the United States, most of the Vietnamese enclaves are labeled Little Saigon, although some use the term "Little Vietnam", with the major concentrations on the west coast, especially in the U.S. state of California. 
Chicago, Illinois, US.
West Argyle Street Historic District in the U.S. city of Chicago is known as "Little Vietnam" by most notable sources.
New Orleans, Louisiana, US.
Eastern New Orleans is known as "Little Vietnam" in the area called Village de L'Est where it is home to the Dong Phuong Oriental Bakery.
Orlando, Florida, US.
East Colonial Drive in the U.S. city of Orlando, Florida has a "Little Vietnam" that is known for its Vietnamese cuisine. The area has been evolving since the 1970s and is currently a 10 block stretch Colonial Drive.
Asia.
Singapore.
One notable Little Vietnam is the one in Singapore on Joo Chiat Road with its karaoke bars where they say "... the smart ones learn Mandarin to cater to as many customers as possible. 
Europe.
Little Hanoi (Former Soviet-bloc Nations).
In the former Soviet-bloc nations of East Germany, Czech Republic, and Russia, the Vietnamese enclaves are usually labeled "Little Hanoi" to reflect the representation of the North Vietnamese capital of Hanoi. Other names, (for example: "Sapa") will usually reflect other aspects of the North Vietnamese geography.
France.
In southern France, a "Little Vietnam" in Sainte Livrade sur Lot which housed 1,160 Vietnamese refugees in a refugee camp faces demolition after being in existence since 1956. The location has been in neglect where 120 families still live in shacks who are third and fourth generations of the people affected by the World War II.
United Kingdom.
London's "Pho Mile" is located in Shoreditch along Kingsland Road.
Oceania.
Australia.
In Melbourne the suburb of Richmond has a large proportion of Vietnamese-Australians, Victoria Street is often nicknamed "Little Vietnam." Other Vietnamese communities are centered around Springvale Road in Springvale, most parts of Footscray and also in St Albans. In Sydney they are concentrated in Bankstown, Cabramatta, Canley Vale and Villawood.

Morten Wetland

Morten Wetland (born 12 May 1951) is a Norwegian jurist, diplomat and politician for the Labour Party. He is a former State Secretary, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Norway to the United Nations in New York.
Career.
1976–1998.
Wetland graduated from the University of Oslo with the cand.jur. degree in 1976. He was hired in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the same year, but left to work as a deputy judge in Grimstad from 1978 to 1979. From 1983 to 1983 he worked as a secretary at the Norwegian embassy in West Germany.
He then returned to Norway to work as a civil servant. He worked in the Norwegian Office of the Prime Minister from 1985 to 1990, except for a period between 1989 and 1990 when he worked as director of the legal department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1991 he was promoted to deputy under-secretary of State () in the Office of the Prime Minister. In 1992 Wetland was responsible for coining the phrase , which translates to "It is typical for Norwegians to be clever". The phrase was used in a New Year's speech by then-Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, and quickly became famous in Norway.
In 1994 Wetland moved from the administrative to the partisan political stratum in the Office of the Prime Minister, as he was appointed State Secretary in the third cabinet Brundtland. He lost this job when Gro Harlem Brundtland resigned in 1996. In the new cabinet Jagland, he was appointed State Secretary in the Ministry of Industry and Trade, but only lasted for less than two months, from 1 November to 18 December 1996.
He worked briefly for the publishing house Gyldendal in 1997, before spending the next year as campaign leader for Gro Harlem Brundtland, who ran for the position as Director-General of the World Health Organization. This was successful as Brundtland was appointed in May 1998.
1998–2005.
In 1998 Wetland was proclaimed Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, for his work as a civil servant. The same year be became the Norway's Ambassador to Germany, serving until 2003.
During this period, he notably fell out with Bjarne Lindstrøm, who, being permanent under-secretary of State () in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was the highest-ranking bureaucrat in the Ministry. Wetland resigned, reportedly due to the tension, and worked two years as a director in Statkraft.
However, Bjarne Lindstrøm was himself a controversial person. In 2005 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came under scrutiny for the handling of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, a natural disaster that gravely affected Norwegian citizens abroad. An "ad hoc" commission was set up, with Jan Reinås as the leader and Wetland as a member. Its final report contained strong criticism of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Lindstrøm lost his position as permanent under-secretary, although he became Norway's Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Wetland was publicly accused, by anonymous sources, of having a personal vendetta against Lindstrøm; however no sanctions were taken against this.
2005–2008.
In the autumn of 2005, when the second cabinet Stoltenberg assumed office, Wetland returned to politics as State Secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister. At the time of the appointment, it was noted that Wetland was a member of the so-called "Kristiania Forum", an informal group consisting of perceived right-wing elite members of the Labour Party.
He left on 1 January 2008, having handed in his resignation in late 2007.
2008–present.
In late February 2008 he was appointed as Norway's new Permanent Representative to the United Nations. This was not uncontroversial. The foreign affairs administration had originally singled out another candidate, peace process veteran Mona Juul, who was the deputy leader of the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations at that time. Instead, Wetland was appointed.
Already in December 2007, when it became known that Wetland had applied for the position, the question was raised whether Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg or Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Støre had a conflict of interest in the process. Both were given the green light by law experts in the Ministry of Justice. Nonetheless, Stoltenberg, whose wife was a friend of Juul, chose to back out of the process in order to act "cautious". He was not present when the Council of State discussed the case. Jonas Gahr Støre chose to participate in the Council of State meeting. It surfaced, however, that Støre and Wetland had a long history of acquaintance, having attended each other's fortieth birthday parties in 1990 and 1991 respectively. Støre was specifically criticized for this by the political opposition. He replied that Wetland was more of a colleague than a personal friend, that a friendship does not entail a conflict of interest in the juridical sense, and that he had not only worked with Wetland, but rather "three or four" of the applicants.
In 2012 Wetland left the position as Permanent Representative to the United Nations. He was hired by the communications company First House.
Personal life.
Wetland is married, and has two children.

<doc id="20303348" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20303348" title="USS Orca (AVP-49)">
USS Orca (AVP-49)

The second USS "Orca" (AVP-49) was a United States Navy seaplane tender in commission from 1944 to 1947 and from 1951 to 1960.
Construction, commissioning, and shakedown.
"Orca" was laid down on 13 July 1942 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. She was launched on 4 October 1942, sponsored by Mrs. J. W. Reeves, Jr., and commissioned on 23 January 1944, with Commander Morton K. Fleming, Jr., in command.
New Guinea campaign.
After shakedown off San Diego, California, "Orca" sailed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, escorting escort aircraft carrier . Reporting to Commander, Naval Air Force, United States Seventh Fleet, she was ordered on to Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea, where she commenced operations with her first seaplane squadron on 26 May 1944.
"Orca"s squadrons carried out “Black Cat” night bombing and reconnaissance missions during the ensuing five months. These missions, in which black-painted Martin PBM Mariner flying boats conducted night bombing strikes against Japanese shipping, proved to be tremendously destructive to the Japanese. For them, the squadrons were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and Commander Fleming, "Orca"s captain and commanding officer of the task unit that included the ship and her squadrons, was awarded the Legion of Merit. "Orca"s squadrons also carried out air-sea rescue missions in support of the United States Army's 13th Air Force. 
Philippines campaign.
In early November 1944, "Orca" moved into the Leyte Gulf area in the Philippines, as that campaign was reaching the critical stage. She sent her planes into Ormoc Bay right under the noses of the Japanese on 3 December 1944, and they taxied around the bay for nearly an hour picking up survivors of destroyer , sunk the previous night. After the Japanese finally realized what was taking place, they threw up quite a fusillade. The pilots bore down on the throttles and headed for the open sea. Heavily loaded, the old Consolidated PBY Catalinas finally heaved themselves into the air, after about a three-nautical-mile (5.6 km) run. Making additional trips, they were able to rescue 167 "Cooper" survivors.
"Orca" was attacked by a lone plane on 27 August 1944, but her guns drove it off. That next night, the Japanese radio propagandist Tokyo Rose announced that “The volume of ack-ack which met the previous night’s raid indicated that a battleship of the "Wisconsin" class had been sighted at Middleburg Island.”
"Orca" came under similar attack twice on 26 November 1944, and was credited with an assist on a plane which narrowly missed motor torpedo boat tender .
On 2 January 1945, "kamikaze" suicide planes attacked "Orca"s convoy formation. In the attack, a minesweeper was destroyed and "Orca" was slightly damaged as a plane crashed close alongside, showering her with wreckage and bomb fragments and wounding six of her gun crew. Tokyo Rose overstated the attack's results by announcing that the "kamikaze" "special attack group" had sunk one battleship and one heavy cruiser and seriously damaged three other cruisers in a large convoy moving north along the cost of Mindoro.
"Orca" continued to service air squadrons and carry out rescue missions until the end of World War II on 15 August 1945.
"Orca" earned three battle stars for service in World War II. She also was commended, along with her squadrons, by General Walter Krueger, U. S. 6th Army commander, for landing scouts behind Japanese lines, carrying supplies to Philippine guerrilla forces, and evacuating wounded during the Philippines campaign.
Peacetime service 1945-1947.
On 26 September 1945, "Orca" arrived at Okinawa to assist in the occupation of Japan. She was soon detached to proceed to the United States.
"Orca"s next big assignment was furnishing services for the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests. "Orca" then decommissioned on 31 October 1947 and joined the reserve fleet in San Francisco, California.
Peacetime service 1951-1960.
"Orca" re-commissioned on 15 December 1951 and operated out of San Diego through 1952, under the command of Commander A. K. Espenas. On 5 January 1953 she was underway for the Philippines.
On 2 August 1954, "Orca" relieved destroyer escort at Hong Kong as station ship. By 25 February 1955 she was back in San Diego for leave and upkeep.
"Orca" deployed to the Western Pacific on 11 July 1955 for another tour of duty in which she weathered two severe typhoons. She returned to the United States again on 1 December 1955 and was able to spend her first Christmas in four years at home. Her leave period was extended to 15 January 1956.
Following extensive training during the early months of 1956, "Orca" deployed to the Western Pacific for a seven-month tour on 24 April 1956. During this deployment, she was awarded the Yellow "E" for excellence in the Air Department for fiscal year 1956. She returned to San Diego on 19 November 1956.
"Orca" made a subsequent Western Pacific cruise beginning 22 August 1956 and continued to provide service to the United States Pacific Fleet until she decommissioned again in March 1960 and went into reserve on the Columbia River in Oregon.
Ethiopian Navy service.
In January 1962, "Orca" was loaned to Ethiopia under the Military Assistance Program. Sold outright to Ethiopia in March 1976, she served as the training ship , the Ethiopian Navy's largest ship, for almost 30 years.
In May 1991, at the end of Eritrean revolution, the independence of Eritrea made Ethiopia a landlocked country, and "Ethiopia" was among ten Ethiopian Navy ships to escape to Yemen. Never again operational, "Ethiopia" survived as a hulk in Yemen until she was sold for scrapping in 1993.

<doc id="20303368" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20303368" title="List of AFC champions">
List of AFC champions

The American Football Conference (AFC) is one of two conferences within the National Football League, the National Football Conference (NFC) being the other. The AFC has its roots in the American Football League (AFL), which began to play in 1960. In 1970, the AFL merged with the NFL. As part of the merger, the former AFL teams, plus three former NFL teams (the Baltimore Colts, the Cleveland Browns and the Pittsburgh Steelers), were placed into the AFC. The remaining former NFL teams were placed in the NFC.
Background.
The AFL or AFC champion is not necessarily the team with the best record in the regular season. Rather, the champion is decided by the AFC Championship Game (formerly the AFL Championship Game) as part of the post-season playoffs involving the teams with the best regular season records. The Houston Oilers won the first two AFL championships, in 1960 and 1961. The only other team to win two consecutive AFL championships prior to the merger was the Buffalo Bills, who won in 1964 and 1965 with future United States Congressman, HUD Secretary and Vice-Presidential nominee Jack Kemp at quarterback. The first team to win three consecutive AFL or AFC championships was the Miami Dolphins in 1971 through 1973. The only team to win four consecutive AFL or AFC championships was the Buffalo Bills in 1990 through 1993.
Through the 2010 season, the most AFL or AFC championships won by any team is eight, by the Pittsburgh Steelers. The New England Patriots and Denver Broncos have each won seven AFC championships. The Buffalo Bills won six AFL or AFC championships and the Miami Dolphins and Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders have each won five AFL or AFC championships. The Raiders have also been the AFL or AFC runner up, as a result of losing the AFL or AFC Championship Game, a record nine times. The Steelers and Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers have each been the runner up seven times.
The record for the most regular season wins by an AFL or AFC champion is 16, by the 2007 New England Patriots, with a perfect 16–0 record. No AFL or AFC champion has won exactly 15 games. Seven AFL or AFC champions have won 14 games, including three Miami Dolphins teams. Six of the teams that won 14 games did so in a 16 game season. Only the 1972 Miami Dolphins won 14 games in a 14 game season, with their perfect 14–0 record.
Don Shula was the head coach for five AFL or AFC championship teams, more than any other head coach. Shula coached the Miami Dolphins to AFC championships in 1971, 1972, 1973, 1982 and 1984. Chuck Noll, Marv Levy and Bill Belichick each coached four AFC champions. Hank Stram and Dan Reeves each coached three AFL or AFC champions.
John Elway and Tom Brady have been the starting quarterback for five AFL or AFC championship teams, more tham any other quarterback. Elway was the starring quarterback for the 1986, 1987, 1989, 1997 and 1998 Denver Broncos. Tom Brady was the starting quarterback for the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007 and 2011 New England Patriots. Terry Bradshaw and Jim Kelly were each the starting quarterback for four AFC champions.
Franco Harris and Thurman Thomas were each the leader in rushing yards for an AFC champion four times. Larry Csonka was the leader in rushing yards for an AFC champion three times. Andre Reed was the leader in receiving yards for an AFC champion four times. Paul Warfield was the leader in receiving yards for an AFC champion three times.
The 1973 Miami Dolphins had seven first team All-Pros, more than any other AFC champion since the NFC/AFC merger. The 1971 Miami Dolphins, 1979 Pittsburgh Steelers and 2007 New England Patriots each had five 1st team All-Pros. The 1970 Baltimore Colts, 1982 Miami Dolphins, 1987 Denver Broncos and 1996 and 2001 New England Patriots did not have any 1st team All-Pros. Jack Ham is the only defensive player to be named as a 1st team All-Pro for four AFC champions. Ham was a 1st team All-Pro for the 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979 Pittsburgh Steelers. Larry Little is the only offensive lineman to be named as a 1st team All-Pro for three AFC champions, the 1971–1973 Miami Dolphins. Garo Yepremian is the only kicker to be named as a 1st team All-Pro for two AFC champions, the 1971 and 1973 Miami Dolphins.
At the end of the 1966 season, the Super Bowl began to be played between the AFL champion and the NFL champion. After the AFL/NFL merger in 1970, the Super Bowl continued to be played between the AFC champion and the NFC champion. The AFL champion lost the first two Super Bowls. The 1968 AFL champion New York Jets with Joe Namath at quarterback became the first AFL team to win the Super Bowl. Starting with that Super Bowl, the AFL or AFC champion won 11 out of 13 Super Bowls. However, the AFC champion lost 13 consecutive Super Bowls, from the 1984 AFC champion Miami Dolphins through the 1996 AFC champion New England Patriots. Overall, the AFL or AFC champion has won 21 of the 45 Super Bowls played through the end of the 2009 season.

Tuncay Güney

Tuncay Güney (; born 25 August 1972 in Kargı), code name "Ipek" (silk), is a Turkish citizen of Jewish origin who claims to have infiltrated the Turkish Gendarmerie's intelligence organization JITEM, Ergenekon, the Workers' Party, and the Gülen movement before being outed. He is subordinate to Mehmet Eymür, who was discharged from the National Intelligence Organization (, MİT). The information Güney has gleaned on these organizations make him a key figure in the ongoing Ergenekon investigation. His statements form the backbone of the 2455-page Ergenekon indictment, which mentions him 492 times and labels him a suspect at large ().
Background and personal life.
Güney was born in the village of Gölet, Kargı, to Ali and Ayşe Güney; the youngest of three siblings. Güney says his family, whose roots can be traced to Egypt, was outcast by his community for being Sabbateans. Less than a year after his birth, they left for the Harmantepe neighborhood of Gültepe, İstanbul.
In her spare time, his mother teaches the Koran to her neighbors' children in Gültepe. Güney says it was normal for crypto-Jews to express their devoutness to Islam, such as by sending their children to seminaries, in order to be accepted. His mother says "If my son said we are Jewish, we are Jewish."
His father was nominally a technician for the Beşiktaş School of Applied Fine Arts. According to Güney, this job was a cover for his work as a spy for the MİT, which used the school as training ground. Güney names Mehmet Eymür, the director of its defunct Counter-Terrorism Department, as one of his father's associates. His father started receiving his pension on 7 March 1982, and died on 13 February 1986. His father's funeral was attended by many men in uniforms. One of them was Eymür, who told his mother that they could contact MİT for support. Eymür later denied Güney's allegations that his father worked for the MİT.
When Güney was twelve, a friend of his family called Mithat Ulusoy took Güney to a boarding Islamic seminary () of the Süleymancı sect, in Ayazağa. Güney says that the founders of the seminary are also Sabbateans. The manager of the Ayazağa student dormitory, Halil Atam, remembers Güney as a hard-working and peaceful student. Around the same time, while attending secondary school (), Güney met the Welfare Party's mayor of Kağıthane, Arif Calban. Calban remembers Güney as a "good, bright kid". He allegedly dropped out of Pertevniyal high school after the first year (1986), however the headmaster, Aziz Yeniyol, has no record of Güney. Güney counters that he spent more time attending Tarabya Kemal Atatürk high school of Bedrettin Dalan's İstek Foundation.
Turkish males are obliged to do military service. Güney went to the army in Ardahan on 5 May 1997, but was discharged four months later after receiving an exemption for allegedly being homosexual (cf. LGBT rights in Turkey). Güney said he was bored of the army, so he used his connections to get an exemption report from a psychiatrist at Ankara GATA. However, he denies that the report said he was homosexual. Rather, he says he helped many homosexuals obtain exemptions.
Güney currently lives in Toronto.
Marriages.
On 28 September 1993 he married Nuray Güney, whom he had met through a mutual acquaintance in Germany. The couple divorced on 9 December 1994, after his wife complained that he continually asked for money.
After returning from the military in 1998, Güney married Rabia Taşdemir; the sister of his brother-in-law Adem (through his sister, Keziban). This marriage lasted for two years.
Journalism career.
Güney's employment records start on 1 May 1988. He has assumed a variety of jobs, mostly in journalism, to cover his actual profession of espionage. At the time he was exfiltrated to the United States, he was receiving a government pension. Since he is too young (29) to have retired, this has been adduced as proof of covert payment from the government. His file from the social security administration () was classified during the investigation.
He entered journalism through his maths teacher at Pertevniyal high school, who sent him to Tevfik Yener of "Sabah (newspaper)", where he allegedly became an office boy. Three years later he transferred to "Milliyet", along with Yener. "Newsweek" says it was the deputy headmaster, Ali Kuru, who introduced Güney to Yener. Yener confirms that Kuru asked him to hire Güney, since his father had died. Güney disputes the office boy position, claiming that he had the highest salary in the newspaper. Social Security Institution () records show that he received a monthly salary of approximately 65,500 Lira in 1988 when he started; twice the minimum wage. By 1991, he was earning 1.1 million Lira; five times the minimum wage (which had drastically increased due to inflation).
In 1991, he joined a new, conversative, television channel called Samanyolu TV, of which he was a founding member. In April 1994 he had become the anchorman. It was while preparing a show called "Gündemdekiler" that he met Veli Küçük. With his support, Güney found employment at the newspapers "Tercüman", "Akşam", and television channel HBB. After being discharged from the army for homosexuality, he worked in the military magazine "Yeni Strateji", launched in January 1998. "Yeni Strateji" is owned by Turgut Büyükdağ, and edited by Ümit Oğuztan; an Ergenekon detainee.
He was paid case-by-case by "Akşam" from 1994-1996 to serve as a conduit of information from Veli Küçük. His boss, Behiç Kılıç, related an incident in which Güney brought the U.S. Ambassador, Robert Pearson, to the office after the publication of an article about the U.S. arming of Iraqi Kurds. Kılıç said that Güney appeared to have a close relationship with Pearson, despite not knowing "a word of English".
During the Susurluk scandal, Güney submitted photos of Abdullah Çatlı dancing with İbrahim Şahin to Kanal D. Ergenekon defendant Ümit Oğuztan alleged that Güney testified before the Susurluk commission, and that he knew Tansu Çiller, Mehmet Ağar, and Necmettin Erbakan.
Before fleeing Turkey, Güney worked for six months at Samanyolu, where he presented a political show called "Doruktakiler".
Spy career.
He was inducted in 1990 (aged 18) by Galip Tuğcu, the head of the Istanbul station. Initially operating in the Reactionary Activities Department () (i.e., countering religious fundamentalism), Güney was transferred to the Iran station in 1992. His assignment was to infiltrate JITEM and Ergenekon. He met Veli Küçük during this assignment, who provided him (and thus MİT) with much information about the Susurluk scandal, which Küçük was implicated in.
Fraud charges (2001).
When Güney's journalism career tanked due to his lack of education, he sought other avenues of income. He set up a car registration racket with a financial budget officer () he had met in Kars, called Murat Oğuz. Güney's brother-in-law and chauffeur, Adem Taşdemir, joined the racket. According to his testimony to the Istanbul First Heavy Penal Court, file number 2002/64, the racket extended to appropriating real estate.
Güney was apprehended on 2 March 2001 after an individual named Timur Büyükölmez filed a complaint to the Fatih Republic Prosecutor's Office on 8 February 2001 stating that he had been cheated by police officers Orhan Sonuç—a.k.a. Tuncay Güney—and Erdal Güventürk—a.k.a. Adem Taşdemir—over the purchase of an SUV. The vehicle was originally a gift from a retired police officer named Ümit Bavbek to Veli Küçük in return for his and Güney's support in "settling" a debt with Semih Tufan Gülaltay, the convicted killer of human rights activist Akın Birdal. When Küçük rejected the car, Güney took it and eventually put it up for sale on a newspaper. Güney took deposits from two people, who reported him to the police upon learning that they had been cheated. In a December 2008 testimony, Küçük said Güney gave him the car because Güney knew that he was about to retire, and had no car of his own. Küçük confirmed that he rejected the car, and said that the Ergenekon investigation would probably have begun much earlier had he accepted it. In the next hearing, Küçük testified that his acquaintanceship with Güney was superficial, and that he had not seen Güney since 2000.
He was questioned by the İstanbul Gayrettepe Public Order Department () on 1 March 2001. A few days later, without conducting any searches, he was transferred to the Anti-Smuggling and Organized Crime Department () led by Adil Serdar Saçan. A search of Güney's home four days later by the latter group turned up two guns, fake license plates, 115 fake diplomas, numerous identity cards () of people he had allegedly had sex with—and the six sacks of evidence on which the Ergenekon indictment is based. After his questioning, he was arrested on 8 March 2001 and taken to Bayrampaşa prison. According to his lawyer, Güney was released the next day on 3000 Lira bail, paid by Güney's sister with the proceeds of the sale of a building in Tarlabaşı, Taksim owned by Güney. His friend and Ergenekon suspect, Ümit Oğuztan, testified that he had stayed briefly at the Taksim apartment; a three-floor property Güney had allegedly bought from Matild Manukyan on 29 May 2000.
Güney was exfiltrated to the United States one day after being released on bail, despite an injunction from travelling, on a ten-year visa he had obtained in 4 February 1999. The newspaper "Yeni Şafak" says that his departure was encouraged by both Saçan, and Küçük.
In November 2008 it was revealed that Saçan had discovered Güney's identity as a spy during the interrogation, and that upon learning this, Küçük negotiated his release in order to prevent the police from learning that Güney worked for JİTEM. At this point, the undersecretary of the MİT, Şenkal Atasagun, stepped in and asked the CIA to exfiltrate him to the United States. MİT's Istanbul station chief, Kubilay Günay, and his team had Güney flown by Turkish Airlines to Manhattan, New York City, where he was put up in the Marmara Manhattan on 301 East 94 Street. One week later he moved to a flat owned by the MİT next to the Manhattan post office.
Güney was indicted on May 16 for falsifying vehicle registration documents. By that time he had been exfiltrated, with the help of Adnan Akfırat of Perinçek's "Aydınlık" magazine. (Retired MİT official Mehmet Eymür said that Güney had infiltrated Perinçek's organization.)
In 2004 he obtained political asylum and moved to Toronto, Canada, supposedly with the help of the owner of the hotel he was staying in Manhattan, a Mehmet Özbay from Urfa. Güney holds that Özbay gave his identity card to Abdullah Çatlı, a hitman who died in the Susurluk crash. However, a governmental commission set up to investigate the accident concluded that "Mehmet Özbay" was an alias. The actual owners of the hotel, the Marmara Manhattan, are the Gürsel family.
Güney alleges that entered Canada on 14 February 2004, and that his application took 1.5 years to process. His legal counsel is from Legal Aid Ontario. Güney initially sought asylum for sexual discrimination, stating that his circumstances were "exceptional", however the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada concluded that he was an ordinary applicant. Numerous observers have said that Güney played the religious- and sexual persecution cards in order to bolster his asylum application.
Appearances on "32. Gün".
Before his outing, Güney participated in three teleconference debates on "Kanal D"s "32. Gün", where participants questioned how, as a journalist unknown in the Turkish press community, he came into possession of six sacks full of evidence. (In the indictment, he is recorded as having obtained them from a disgruntled army officer.) Later in the show, Güney pointedly threatened Perinçek with retaliation if he continued to print allegations about him in his magazine "Aydınlık". When asked about allegations of his being a CIA agent, Güney said that he did not work for the CIA, but added that it was an ordinary organization anybody was free to work for. In the second show, when pressed, Güney said he was protecting Küçük. (During the course of the Ergenekon investigation, it emerged that the MİT had requested support from the CIA to procure Güney a visa.)
During the 28 November episode, Güney was asked about his religious identity and Jacob's House Synagogue, his MİT affiliation, his trips to Iran, and his pension benefits. Güney said that journalists had been unable to verify his status in Canada because he came from an obscure Jewish congregation. Concerning the orphanhood benefits resulting from his father's death in 1986, he vacillated over whether he had been paid until age 18 (adulthood), or 20. According to the chairman of the Social Security Ministry (), Faruk Çelik, Güney was compensated from 1 March 1986 to 1 October 1992, when he completed his secondary education. According to his mother, he was paid until age 18.
Outing (2008).
Güney's identity was not revealed until the chief prosecutor of the Ergenekon investigation, Zekeriya Öz, requested his file from the MİT during the sixteenth hearing, in November 2008. MİT responded on 9 May 2008 with document number 11.010.05.051/14-16015736. Öz had noticed that Güney was referred to as Tuncay Güney İPEK in a confidential MİT report seized from Güney during the course of the investigation. The report, numbered 10.251.01.011(IST00736) and dated 7 February 1997, indicates his station and alias. The report writes that police chief Hanefi Avcı's testimony to the Susurluk commission left Güney's undercover superior in JITEM, Veli Küçük, in a bind, and that this was a liability for Güney himself.
However, Güney's alias had already been mentioned in the press (albeit without an explanation of its meaning), and his boss Mehmet Eymür outed him two weeks before the court announcement, in an open letter to the deputy chief of the Workers' Party (the party chief himself being accused of being an Ergenekon ringleader). Eymür had alluded to Güney's identity as far back as 2000, referring to him as "Tunca" in an article deriding Güney for profiting from the sale of photographs to the press of people involved in the Susurluk scandal. His boss at the newspaper "Akşam", Behiç Kılıç, said Güney stole pictures from the archives which were used to create a widely circulated composite of prime minister Mesut Yılmaz and notorious criminal Abdullah Çatlı.
In response to the "Sabah" article purportedly revealing his identity (see below for a dissenting view), the MİT immediately issued a press release, albeit an ambiguous one. It stated that Güney was not an employee; a "registered informant" (). Rather, he was a person they found suspicious. It insinuated that he was subordinate to Eymür, whose Counter-Terrorism Department was disbanded in 1997. "Sabah" posted a follow-up article, asking Güney directly if he worked for the MİT. Güney said it was too early to speak out, and that doing so would violate MİT's bylaws. Reading between the lines of the MİT press release, intelligence expert Mahir Kaynak and "Radikal"'s Ismet Berkan said that Güney should be associated with Eymür, not the MİT.
Finally, Eymür contradicted the statements on his Web site by saying that he did not know Güney. One day later, Güney likewise denied knowing Eymür. Indeed, he denied ever having worked for any intelligence agency. Ergenekon defendant Ümit Oğuztan testified that he had witnessed Eymür call Güney by telephone after learning that Güney had befriended an Iranian diplomat called Muhsin Karger Azad.
Owing to confusion over Güney's status, the MİT report was leaked once again, to a different newspaper, this time in full.
The editor-in-chief of the newspaper "Radikal" took it to mean that the "Sabah" article was disinformation, and that Güney was not from the MİT, but followed by it.
Subjects of espionage.
JITEM/Ergenekon.
In 1992 the MIT tasked Güney with infiltrating Ergenekon and the Gendarmerie's counter-terrorism and intelligence wing, JITEM, and reporting to the MIT bureau in Dolmabahçe Palace's harem. Güney says he met retired colonel Necabettin Ergenekon, who some say is the eponymous person behind the organization, that year through a student at the Military Academy, and that Ergenekon introduced him to Veli Küçük; the founder of JITEM and a member of Ergenekon. Necabettin Ergenekon says he retired in 1982 and does not know Güney. In his Ergenekon testimony, Küçük says he met Güney through an elder, retired soldier, implicitly confirming Güney's assertion. In another article, Güney says he met Küçük as a journalist for Samanyolu TV.
He approached Küçük as a journalist, who sent him as a member of JITEM to spy on Massoud Barzani, Jalal Talabani and the leader of Hezbullah, Hüseyin Velioğlu. Küçük did not know that Güney was a double agent for the MİT.
Police testimony.
Güney said his statements, which were instrumental in implicating Küçük, were extracted over nine days of torture (including genital electrocution) and therefore unreliable. However, a more recent article in the same newspaper says that Güney was an expert at dealing with questioning, and had established a good enough rapport to request special treatment. The superior of his two interrogators, Adil Serdar Saçan of the Organized Crime Department, also refutes the torture allegations.
According to police chief Hakan Ünsal Yalçın, Güney openly said he was protected by Küçük and that Ergenekon would get him out. One of his interrogators, Ahmet İhtiyaroğlu, said that Güney was unique among the 24,000 people he had questioned: "It was as if he was sent to tell us something. It is not usual for someone to possess so many documents and talk so freely." The interrogators asked him what Ergenekon was, and Güney proceed to explain. İhtiyaroğlu was amazed by what he had heard and had Güney repeat the story in front of some other associates, paying close attention to Güney's behavior. Contrary to his expectations, İhtiyaroğlu said Güney was very relaxed, except when questioned about the Gülen movement. Güney told İhtiyaroğlu that the Gülen movement is a unit of Ergenekon. İhtiyaroğlu reported his findings to the Istanbul attorney general on 28 October 2008. Once the interrogation tapes were transcribed, a petition was written to request the continuation of the investigation by the Organized Technical Bureau () based on the contents of the tape. This request was submitted to State Security Court (DGM) chief prosecutor Aykut Cengiz Engin (who announced the Ergenekon case). A furious Engin told İhtiyaroğlu that it was out of his jurisdiction, and rejected the request. Later, he changed his mind and had DGM prosecutor Muzaffer Yalçın do some preliminary work. Yalçın decided to re-assign the case from Saçan's Organized Crimes Department to the Intelligence Department, then led by Halil Çatıkkaş by his deputy Niyazi Palabıyık. The Intelligence Department closed the case one year later, citing a lack of evidence to substantiate the claims. Saçan stresses that Çatıkkaş and Palabıyık had nothing to do with it and hints at Veli Küçük and a gang loyal to Fethullah Gülen inside that department. Istanbul governor Erol Çakır, who later formed a security company with Veli Küçük, was aware of the investigation and may have led to its closure at Küçük's behest.
In January 2004, the Ergenekon documents seized from Güney were found in a depot belonging Saçan located in Gazi Osman Paşa, Istanbul. (They are included in the indictment and its annex.) Saçan says he never saw Güney in person. His coworker says that Saçan had a habit of making copies of important pieces of evidence for safe keeping.
Saçan was probed in September 2008 for covering up the Ergenekon investigation, allegedly because documents seized from Veli Küçük contained unfavorable material about Saçan. Furthermore, Güney alleges that Saçan had portions of his interrogation tape scrubbed. What the missing portions of the tape contained is a matter of much speculation.
Saçan's statements in defense of Ergenekon detainee Oktay Yıldırım (the person whose grenades in Ümraniye officially launched the investigation) have gone on record. Since 2002, Saçan was fired six times and sued 39 times (acquitted on 36, as of August 2008). He was detained on 23 September 2008 on charges of being an Ergenekon member. Just before 2009, he was sentenced to five months in prison on charges of concealing the Ergenekon files.
Ergenekon defendant Doğu Perinçek said that the content of Güney's testimony in 2001 was irrelevant to his crime (racketeering) and that the whole affair was a ruse by the CIA to entrap himself, his party, and Turkey.
Güney's testimony is partially included in folders 165 and 442 of the annex. The more complete version in the latter runs 128 pages and also includes a separate 16 page summary. However, Adnan Akfırat of the Workers' Party alleges that even this version is abridged (i.e., from the scrubbed tape) and that the actual transcript is 170 pages.
The court has obtained a copy of the interrogation tapes; four of Güney, and one of Ümit Oğuztan.
The book “Black Box: Ergenekon's Unknown Name, Tuncay Güney”, contains shocking statements from the mysterious witness. Nuh Gönültaş at Bugün wrote about some interesting information from supreme Ergenekon weirdo, Tuncay Güney, in a piece titled "Where are JITEM's acid death wells?" that uses Faruk Arslan’s book, “The Black Box, Tuncay Güney”, as a resource. Güney, who first disclosed Ergenekon and has become a legend, has an important nine-year relationship with Veli Küçük, who was the deep paşa of the 1990s.Güney claims that thousands of Kurdish citizens, who were killed by JITEM as extrajudicial victims for harboring PKK’s secrets, were thrown into acid-filled wells, in which their corpses dissolved. Thus their bodies were never found. This was quite original and new information. Güney advises looking at the BOTAŞ complex which JITEM had used in the Southeast in the 1990s, to find acid-filled death wells. For years, no one knew where the graves of more than 18,000 citizens were, and most of the victims were of Kurdish origin and were killed by "unknown perpetrators"; no one had questioned or dared to question the case before. Güney claims that there are very few people who know where these acid-filled wells are located in the Southeast, and although Veli Küçük is one of them, he does not reveal this information. However, Güney gives a specific address in the book: "The places where JITEM and Küçük's group used were these places. For a clear address, when you go towards the Habur border, close by Mardin's old town Cizre, on the left there is a complex that is guarded by soldiers. If you dig there, there will be a lot of bodies. BOTAŞ has enterprises in Diyarbakır, Batman, Adıyaman and these places should also be checked." As a response to the question as to where they would find the acid, Güney replied in a classic way: "There are several factories in İzmit. Even Küçük's greeting is an order for them. Besides, for drug-trafficking they needed acid. They had become experts in bringing acid." 
For more on this issue, see 32. Gün from November 2008, in which Güney reiterates the claim about the acid-filled wells. Note that I've provided the link for the first in a series of fourteen videos of that particular edition of 32. Gün. Now it looks like the Şırnak state prosecutor is going to investigate the claims of the acid-filled wells. 
The complaint was initially made by the head of the Şırnak Bar Association, based on the book by Faruk Arslan, mentioned in the Nuh Gönultaş piece. Before the state prosecutor's decision to go ahead with the investigation of the acid-filled wells, the Şırnak Bar Association vowed to move to open the wells at first opportunity as soon as their exact locations were identified. The bar association will now be able to do just that, using Arslan’s book. In an article from Zaman, Şırnak Bar Association chief Nuşirevan Elçi says: "This situation gave us hope. Turkey must face its past in order to have a bright future. If there are illegal implementations, these must come before the judiciary. The relatives of those murdered by unknown perpetrators don't know whether or not they are dead these last 15-20 years. This situation puts those people in pain. If this event is disclosed, these people will cease hoping. For Turkey's bright future, these kinds of works must be done. Especially within this context I see the Ergenekon investigation as a new era." In the past, the DTP (a Kurdish party in Turkey) had said that unless Ergenekon was investigated east of the Euphrates, there would be little hope for a solution to the Kurdish question in Turkey. Now let's wait and see how much of this is truly investigated and what the results will reveal. Then we'll find out, too, whether Ergenekon's mysterious "black box" has any credibility.
Gülen movement.
Güney has been in contact with Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher. At one point, Güney submitted a weekly espionage report on the sect to Yavuz Ataç, who then passed it on to Eymür.
Güney arranged his first meetings with Gülen in 1989-1991 at the Fem cram school () in Altunizade, Istanbul.
After leaving his post at "Milliyet", Güney spent his weekends talking to the manager of the Boğaziçi Kırklar boys' dormitory in Gültepe, which he says is affiliated with the sect. The current manager of the dormitory, Ömer Şamil Yalçın, says that Güney was not a registered student.
Through the Cağaloğlu manager of the newspaper "Zaman"'s classifieds section, he found employment at Işık Prodüksiyon on 1 March 1994, a production company that works with Samanyolu TV. "Zaman" and "Samanyolu" are claimed to be Gülen's flagship media organizations. Güney also allegedly stole the much-publicized videotaped speeches of Gülen in which he advised his devotees to take official positions in Turkish state. Güney was fired on 31 October 1994, and Gülen subsequently emigrated to the United States, where he remains to this day.
Journalist Ayşe Önal of "Nokta", who was introduced to Gülen by him while he was producing "Doruktakiler", said she was surprised by how well-connected Güney seemed despite his being only 22 at the time.
Güney alleges that the former chief of Samanyolu TV, Mehmet Demircan, tried to get Veli Küçük to join the Gulen movement, and that Küçük and Gülen know each other from the National Struggle Unity Committee (). 
This organization descends from the Association for Struggling with Communism (), which was set up by the Counter-Guerrilla as a civilian front.
Demircan was fired after he allegedly planned to oust Gülen.
Muhsin Karger Azad.
Güney met an Iranian diplomat called Muhsin Karger Azad in a gay bar, thinking that espionage agents would not look for him there.
Azad was officially the Iran Consulate's political affairs undersecretary, but allegedly also a member the Iranian branch of Operation Gladio, MOD. 
After the MİT learned that the two had made contact, Eymür instructed Güney to report back his findings.
Azad is suspected of being involved in the assassination of Kemalist intellectual Uğur Mumcu. For this, he was expelled to Tehran in 1995. Despite the chronology, Ergenekon suspect Ümit Oğuztan testified that he witnessed Güney collect intelligence on Azad while he (Oğuztan) and Güney were working at Turgut Büyükdağ's "Strateji" magazine in 1997.
United States and Canada (1999 - present).
Güney is alleged to have a string of aliases: Tuncay Güney, Tuncay İpek, Tuncay Güney İpek, Tuncay Bubey, Tolga İpek, Daniel Güney, Daniel Levi, Kemal Kosbağ, Alparslan Evrenos, and Alpaslan Evrenos. An individual named Alpaslan Evrenosoğlu was also alleged to be an alias for Güney, but the police said such a person actually existed.
New York Institute.
While working for "Milliyet", Güney expressed his interest in converting to Christianity and learning English in the United States to a Protestant priest in Turkey. He took six months of English lessons from the church.
He obtained a ten-year visa on 4 February 1999, enabling him to travel to the United States, which he did in June 2001 to avoid being tried for fraud in Istanbul. (He remains convicted in absentia.) His visa is stamped "R B1/B2" (R=Regular, B1=Business, B2=Visitor), which means he is not eligible to work in the United States. In response to a question from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, the Turkish consul said that ten-year "R B1/B2" visas are normally issued "to people providing solid guarantee of returning to Turkey". Erkan Önsel of the Workers' Party (whose chairman is one of the main defendants in the Ergenekon case) alleged that Güney was issued a ten-year visa in order to set the Ergenekon investigation in motion and save himself by traveling abroad.
In New York, Güney found an Evangelical priest called Howard Williams, possibly through his Protestant connections in Turkey, according to "Newsweek". Williams forwarded Güney to an evangelical Turk from Dargeçit, Mardin by the name of Yakup Can, for support. Can says he taught Güney the Old Testament every Thursday—his day off work from the gas station—from noon to eight at night. Finally, Güney converted to Christianity in 2004. In a later "Hürriyet" article, Güney says he never worked in New York.
His nominal employer in the United States was the "New York Institute", with post office box addresses in New Jersey and Toronto, Canada; his next destination. According to Can, Güney set up the organization as a front for his journalism and "research activities". Can assented to lending his name as manager of the organization, though he says he did not take part in any of its activities.
When Güney told Can he had concerns over his safety and immigration status, Can allegedly drove Güney to the Canadian border.
Life School of English.
One of Güney's employers in Canada was the Life School of English, chaired by Tim Stevens of the New York Institute. The LSE is an evangelical language school for refugees, mainly from Iran, Iraq, and Turkey, subsidized by a state fund for refugees. The school formerly operated from the Calvary Church in Toronto, and moved out in order to avoid its $400 monthly fee. Güney said Tim Stevens helped sort out his immigration problems, but the information Stevens gave about Güney's residence turned out to be inaccurate, says "Hürriyet".
Jacob's House.
Güney claims that he is from a Jewish family that descends from Egypt, and that they practiced their faith in secret (crypto-Judaism). He also claims to be a rabbi "Daniel Levi" at the Jacob's House ("B'nai Yakov" in Hebrew) Jewish Community Center. However, journalists investigated his background and raised several concerns:
Finally, Canadian immigration officials do not question the religious qualifications of visa applicants. Based on these grounds, "Milliyet" and "Newsweek" say that Jacob's House is a front organization to enable Güney to reside in Canada.
The congregation's listed address is a post office box (P.O. Box 63085, Toronto), deceptively prefixed "1655 Dufferin Street" (an actual location in Toronto Central), apparently matching the Canadian address of his front organization in the United States, the "New York Institute". This property on 1655 Dufferin Street is a small "medical clinic" building, "immediately available" from PAR-Med Property Services Inc. The U.S. address of the NYI is also a post office box.
Daniel Levi.
The name Güney goes by in Canada is the same as the person who was convicted in absentia with Canadian citizen Mohammed el-Attar (now jailed in Egypt) for being spies for Israel. Like Güney, el-Attar said he was a homosexual, religious convert, and that he confessed only after days of torture. el-Attar said that Levi recommended he identify himself as a homosexual and change his religion before applying for asylum in Canada. The other two convicts at large, who have Turkish first names and have not been sighted, are Kemal Kosba and Tuncay Bubay. According to a senior official at Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kosba, Bubay, and Levi are all aliases for Tuncay Güney. Egyptian sources allege that the convicts were MOSSAD agents trying to recruit Egyptians into MOSSAD.

University Baptist Church – Manila, Philippines

University Baptist Church (UBC) is a Southern Baptist Church located in University Belt in Metro Manila, Philippines.
History.
University Baptist Church began as a student work extension in 1966. A handful of believers requested Reverend Bill Wakefield, the first Baptist Student Union (BSU) Director, to conduct Sunday worship services for them. Rev. Enrique "Henry" Cabalang took the position the following year after few foreigners led the work. He resigned to work as full-time pastor of UBC in 1972. The church established an aggressive ministry in evangelism, missions, and discipleship. Leaders were trained. Pastors, workers, missionaries were produced. Mission churches sprouted in nearby provinces and in Metro Manila until Rev. Cabalang resigned in 1993.
Subsequent senior pastors of UBC Manila after Rev. Cabalang are Rev. Cesar Juan U. delos Santos (1993–1996); Rev. Dr. Danny L. Johnson as Interim Pastor (1996); Rev. Danilo R. Santiago (1997–1998); and Rev. Armand M. Canoy (1999–Aug 2012). Since Rev. Canoy moved to PBTS, the Vice Chair of the BOT/CC, took over the leadership rein of UBC assisted by Pastors Marvin Gibson, Emmanuel Garvez, Rei dela Torre and LLoyd Stephen Reyes. Bro. Peter will turn it over the church leadership to the incoming senior pastor Rev. Mac Ranie M. Reyes in July 2013. 
UBC's ministry structure is purpose-driven: Worship, Service, Missions, Discipleship, and Fellowship. Each purpose is led by a pastor/minister. UBC's mission srategy is focused on establishing student centers (Youth Life Student Center) near universities and colleges. Presently, UBC operates four YL Student Centers in Morayta, Manila (Manila University Belt), Lagro-QC (fronting Fatima University), Sto. Tomas, Batangas (near PUP Sto. Tomas) and Binangonan, Rizal. Each student center is overseen by a Pastor and a ministerial staff, namely Pastor Marvin Gibson and Rowena Flores (Morayta), Pastor Emmanuel Garvez and Leah Malig (Lagro), Pastor Rei dela Torre and his wife Beth (Sto. Tomas) and Pastor Stephen Lloyd Reyes and Jocelyn Villela (Binangonan).
UBC is praying to open a 5th student center anytime soon.

Spinning (polymers)

Spinning is manufacturing process for creating polymer fibers. It is a specialized form of extrusion that uses a spinneret to form multiple continuous filaments. There are five types of spinning: wet, dry, melt, gel, and electrospinning.
Process.
First, the polymer being spun must be converted into a fluid state. If the polymer is a thermoplastic then can be simply melted, otherwise it is dissolved in a solvent or chemically treated to form soluble or thermoplastic derivatives. The molten polymer is then forced through the spinneret, then it cools to a rubbery state, and then a solidified state. If a polymer solution is used, then the solvent is removed after being forced through the spinneret.
Wet spinning.
Wet spinning is the oldest of the four processes. This process is used for polymers that need to be dissolved in a solvent to be spun. The spinneret is submerged in a chemical bath that causes the fiber to precipitate, and then solidify, as it emerges. The process gets its name from this "wet" bath. Acrylic, rayon, aramid, modacrylic, and spandex are produced via this process.For Wet Spinning Solvent Is Used Which Is Evaporates Or Dissolves After Wet Spinning Process And Gives Particular Fibre.
Dry spinning.
Dry spinning is also used for polymers that must be dissolved in solvent. It differs in that the solidification is achieved through evaporation of the solvent. This is usually achieved by a stream of air or inert gas. Because there is no precipitating liquid involved, the fiber does not need to be dried, and the solvent is more easily recovered. Acetate, triacetate, acrylic, modacrylic, polybenzimidazole fiber, spandex, and vinyon are produced via this process.
Melt spinning.
Melt spinning is used for polymers that can be melted. The polymer solidifies by cooling after being extruded from the spinneret. Nylon, olefin, polyester, saran, and sulfar are produced via this process.
Extrusion spinning.
Pellets or granules of the solid polymer are fed into an extruder. The pellets are compressed, heated and melted by an extrusion screw, then fed to a spinning pump and into the spinneret.
Direct spinning.
The direct spinning process avoids the stage of solid polymer pellets. The polymer melt is produced from the raw materials, and then from the polymer finisher directly pumped to the spinning mill. Direct spinning is mainly applied during production of polyester fibers and filaments and is dedicated to high production capacity (>100 ton/day).
Gel spinning.
Gel spinning, also known as dry-wet spinning, is used to obtain high strength or other special properties in the fibers. The polymer is in a "gel" state, only partially liquid, which keeps the polymer chains somewhat bound together. These bonds produce strong inter-chain forces in the fiber, which increase its tensile strength. The polymer chains within the fibers also have a large degree of orientation, which increases strength. The fibers are first air dried, then cooled further in a liquid bath. Some high strength polyethylene and aramid fibers are produced via this process.
Electrospinning.
Electrospinning uses an electrical charge to draw very fine (typically on the micro or nano scale) fibres from a liquid - either a polymer solution or a polymer melt. Electrospinning shares characteristics of both electrospraying and conventional solution dry spinning of fibers. The process does not require the use of coagulation chemistry or high temperatures to produce solid threads from solution. This makes the process particularly suited to the production of fibers using large and complex molecules. Melt electrospinning is also practiced; this method ensures that no solvent can be carried over into the final product. 
Drawing.
Finally, the fibers are drawn to increase strength and orientation. This may be done while the polymer is still solidifying or after it has completely cooled.

Versum de Mediolano civitate

The Versum de Mediolano civitate ("Verse of the City of Milan") or Versus in laudem mediolanensis civitatis ("Verse in Praise of the City of Milan") is an early medieval Latin verse encomium (praise) of Milan, written anonymously around 738, during the era of the Lombard Kingdom. It served as a model for the later Carolingian "Versus de Verona" (c.800), an encomium of its rival Verona. In comparison with the "Versus de Verona" the Milanese encomium is written in polished Latin and a more consistent, more regular prosody. 
The "Versum" celebrates not only the Christian heritage of Milan, its churches and saints, but also its pagan Roman history. The poet praises its "forum, with very beautiful buildings, and all its roads are solidly paved with blocks; it draws water for its baths through an aqueduct" (lines 16–18). The bulk of the verses retell the spiritual history of Milan, especially its bishops and martyrs, and also its unique Ambrosian rite. The piety of the Milanese, their wealth, and their close connection with the Lombard kings are also cited in support of its pre-eminence among the cities of northern Italy. 
The "Versum" may be the contribution of Milan, the ecclesiastical capital of Italy, to a literary rivalry with the royal capital, Pavia. Milan is described as "the queen of towns, mother of the realm ... who bears the eminent title of metropolis. The immense dignity of her power endures, so that all the bishops of ancient Italy ["presules Ausoniae"] come to her to be instructed according to the dictates of canon law." Pavia also had a canon law school.

Here We Go Again!

Here We Go Again! is an album by American folk music group The Kingston Trio, released in 1959 (see 1959 in music). It was one of the four the Trio would have simultaneously in Billboard's Top 10 albums during the year. It spent eight weeks at #1 and received an RIAA gold certification the same day as "At Large". "A Worried Man" b/w "San Miguel" was its lead-off single, though it just made the Top 20. In November, two non-album songs were released as a single—"Coo Coo-U" b/w "Green Grasses"—but did not chart.
History.
Ben Blake states in the 1992 reissue liner notes: ""Here We Go Again!" was reportedly the first Kingston Trio album on which Voyle Gilmore utilized what was called 'double-voicing' whenever all three group members sang in unison. This was accomplished by having them record their vocals twice; then Gilmore simply overdubbed one of the tracks. This gave the group a fuller sound. Recorded at Studio B in Los Angeles, "Here We Go Again!" also benefited from Capitol's Grand Canyon-like echo chamber, which Gilmore used to make the Trio's instruments 'ring' like no other folk group, before or since."
"Molly Dee" was written by John Stewart who would eventually become a member of the Trio, replacing Dave Guard.
"Across the Wide Missouri" is the Trio's version of the popular American folk song "Oh Shenandoah".
“Goober Peas” dates from the Confederate South and “A Worried Man” (”Worried Man Blues”) is a song first recorded by The Carter Family in the 1930s and Woody Guthrie in the 1940s.
Reception.
Sales of "Here We Go Again!" rose to over 900,000 copies reaching the number one chart position for eight weeks. At one point in 1959 after the release of "Here We Go Again!", the Trio had four records at the same time among the Top 10 selling albums according to "Billboard Magazine's" "Top Ten Albums" chart for five consecutive weeks in November and December 1959, a record unmatched now for over 50 years.
"Here We Go Again!" received Grammy nominations in the Folk category and the Vocal Group category.
Allmusic critic Matt Fink noted standout tracks in his review and called the release "a very well-rounded album." In his review of the 1992 reissue, critic Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr. wrote ""At Large" and "Here We Go Again!" capture the Kingston Trio early in their career, grounded in the success of their first albums and searching for new directions. Fans, folk revival enthusiasts, and the curious will enjoy this one."

Esme Mackinnon

Esmé Mackinnon (2 December 1913 – 9 July 1999), known as Muffie, was a British alpine skier from Edinburgh, Scotland, remembered as the first female FIS World Champion in both downhill and slalom. The editors of "Ski" magazine called Mackinnon and fellow British skier Audrey Sale-Barker "probably the first women who could really be called racers." Sir Arnold Lunn wrote that she "had the most remarkable record of any lady racer." In addition to her world championships, Mackinnon won the slalom and combined titles at the prestigious Arlberg-Kandahar races in March 1933, in Mürren, Switzerland.
After her skiing success, she married one L. M. Murphy.
1931 World Championships.
At the age of 17, Mackinnon received two gold medals at the 1931 World Championships in Mürren, Switzerland, winning both the slalom and the downhill. The races were held in deep, soft snow conditions that presented no problem for Mackinnon.
Mackinnon also won a third, unofficial race at the 1931 Championships, from Grütschalp to Lauterbrunnen. As Mackinnon approached the finish in Lauterbrunnen, she encountered a funeral procession passing by and stopped to wait. The timekeeper stopped the clock and then restarted it when she resumed her run. Some sources maintain that Mackinnon did this out of respect for the departed. According to Lunn's first-hand account, though, Mackinnon stopped out of necessity:
In any case, the Austrian protest was dismissed and Mackinnon was named the winner. Her final time was 10 minutes, 4.4 seconds.

Griffith Williams (bishop)

Griffith Williams (1589?-1672) was the Anglican bishop of Ossory. He was opposed to the puritans.
Life.
He was born at Treveilian in the parish of Llanrug, near Carnarvon, in 1589 or 1590, the son of a freeholder in the parish. His mother was a descendant of the house of Penmynydd in Anglesey. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 15 June 1604. He was sent there by his uncle, but after his aunt took a dislike to him, his means of support were cut off. 
Through John Williams, Williams obtained employment at Cambridge as a private tutor, and was admitted to Jesus College, where he graduated B.A. in 1605-6 and M.A. in 1609. He was incorporated M.A. at Oxford on 10 July 1610, graduated B.D. at Cambridge in 1616, and proceeded D.D. in 1621. He was ordained deacon by the bishop of Rochester and priest by the bishop of Ely, serving as curate at Hanwell in Middlesex. In 1608 he was presented to the rectory of Foxcott in Buckinghamshire by Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, and afterwards became lecturer at St. Peter's in Cheapside and at St. Paul's Cathedral for five years.
On 11 January 1611-12 he was instituted rector of St Benet Sherehog in London through the influence of his patron, John Williams, and resigned the rectory of Foxcott. He had strong high-church sympathies, which roused the dislike of the puritans, and after the appearance of his first publication, "The Resolution of Pilate", they prevailed on John King, bishop of London, to suspend him in 1616. He was also bound over to appear at Newgate to answer the charges brought against him, but was discharged by Thomas Coventry (afterwards Lord Coventry), who estreated the recognisances of his accusers.
After his suspension, from which he was eventually released on appeal to the prerogative court, he resigned his living, retired for a short time to Cambridge, and, on his return to London, found friends in the archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot, and in the chancellor, Sir Thomas Egerton, who presented him to the rectory of Llanllechid in Carnarvonshire. Here he became involved almost immediately in a dispute with his diocesan, Lewis Bayly, bishop of Bangor, a strong puritan, to whom his ecclesiastical views cannot have been acceptable. Bayly wished him to exchange his living for another, and, on his refusal, presented articles against him ex officio. Williams appealed to the court of arches, and Abbot came to his rescue, reprimanding Bayly, and giving Williams license to preach through several dioceses in his province.
London and Bangor.
Four years later, however, finding his position intolerable, after a visit to Cambridge he returned to London, and in 1625 became domestic chaplain to Philip Herbert, 1st earl of Montgomery (afterwards 4th Earl of Pembroke), and tutor to his children. In 1626 he was presented to the rectory of Trefdraeth in Anglesey. On 17 July 1628 he was installed prebendary of the eighth stall at Westminster, and on 28 March 1634 he was instituted dean of Bangor. About 1636 he was appointed a royal chaplain. He was on the point of being nominated tutor to Prince Charles and the Duke of Gloucester, but at the last moment William Laud, who disliked him in spite of their theological sympathies, obtained the appointment of Brian Duppa instead. Williams also states that "before he was forty years old, he narrowly escaped being elected bishop of St. Asaph," probably on the death of John Hanmer, but on that occasion also saw another preferred to him at the instance of Laud.
Ossory.
In 1641 he was raised to the Irish see of Ossory by a patent dated 11 September. He had resigned his prebend a few months before, but retained his deanery "in commendam" till his death. On 26 September he was consecrated, but in less than a month he was forced to fly to England by the outbreak of the Irish rebellion of 1641. He came to Apethorpe in Northamptonshire, where he possessed a house, and where he had settled his wife and children. On the night of his arrival he was arrested by a troop of cavalry, under Captain Flaxon, and carried before the parliamentary commissioners at Northampton.
His position was perilous, for he had with him the manuscript of his "Vindiciæ Regum", with the words "The Grand Rebellion" written largely on the cover. The sheets were actually in the hands of Sir John North, one of the commissioners, but Williams contrived to get it from him before he had looked at the title, and afterwards, by representing himself as a victim of the Irish rebels, he procured a safe-conduct and the restitution of his belongings. He immediately rejoined the king, and attended him, as chaplain, at the battle of Edgehill on 23 Oct. 1642.
1642-1644.
Early in 1643 he published his "Vindiciæ Regum, or the Grand Rebellion; that is a Looking-glass for Rebels, whereby they may see, how by Ten Several Degrees they shall ascend to the Heighth of their Design" (Oxford, 4to). This vigorous invective against the parliamentarians attained considerable fame, and was publicly burnt by order of parliament. It immediately drew a reply from John Goodwin, entitled "Os Ossorianum, or a Bone for a Bishop to pick",which also appeared in an abridged form, as "Os, Ossis, and Oris", within the same year. 
In the meantime, after spending most of the winter of 1642-3 at Oxford, Williams retired to Wales to compose a second onslaught on the parliamentarians, "The Discovery of Mysteries, or the Plots and Practices of a prevalent Faction in this present Parliament to overthrow the established Religion ... and to subvert the fundamentall Lawes of this famous Kingdome" (Oxford, 1643, 4to; 1645, 4to). Falkland, misliking some of its sentiments, desired to suppress it, but he was overruled by the king. Its publication earned Williams fresh notoriety and substantial punishment. On 8 March 1643/44, while he was preaching at the university church before the royalist parliament, his house at Apethorpe was plundered by the parliamentary troops, his wife and children driven forth, and his possessions sequestered. His sufferings increased his zeal, and in the following winter appeared "Jura Majestatis; the Rights of Kings both in Church and State, granted first by God, secondly, violated by Rebels, and, thirdly, vindicated by the Truth; and the Wickedness of the Faction of this pretended Parliament at Westminster" (Oxford, 1644, 4to). 
In 1643, shortly before his last work was published, he was employed by the king to try to bring over his patron, the Earl of Pembroke. Repairing to London he found the earl in bed, and so incensed him by his exhortations that he was forced to retire hastily in great dread that the earl would deliver him into the hands of parliament.
On trying to quit the city he was stopped and brought before the lord mayor, to whom he said that "he was a poor pillaged preacher from Ireland, who came to London to see his friends," and now desired to go to some friends in Northampton. By this means he obtained a pass to Northampton and reached Oxford, whence, shortly after, he passed into Wales, and thence to Ireland. During these years he contributed to the royal cause as freely from his purse as with his pen, giving the king the greater part of his private revenue.
1645-1660.
In 1645 he visited England and had an interview with the king, and on his return found himself in Anglesey when it submitted to General Thomas Mytton. After in vain exhorting the royalists to resist, he managed by a succession of adroit stratagems to reach Ireland, and on 1 April 1647 was presented to the rectory of Rathfarnham, near Dublin. He resided in that city until its surrender in the same year, when he was included by name in the benefits of the capitulation. Ormonde sent him a sum of money to relieve his necessities, but on his way to Wales, to live on a small patrimony he possessed there, he was taken prisoner by Captain Beeche, who robbed him of all he had and left him to make his way back to Dublin in a destitute condition. Dr. Loftus furnished him with money to carry him to London, and he appealed to the committee of sequestrations for the benefits of the Dublin capitulation. On learning that he was the author of "Vindiciæ Regum", the committee told him he deserved to have his head cut off, and passed on to the next business without giving him any redress. Armed with a letter from Fairfax, he had better fortune with the committees at Northampton and Anglesey, to which he was driven by poverty to resort on foot. After regaining his small possessions, he lived at his house in Llanllechid in great poverty, preparing his "Great Antichrist" for press. His old patron, Pembroke, offered him a valuable living in Lancashire if he would submit to parliament; but this he refused, as well as an offer of Henry Cromwell's of £100 a year on the same terms. In 1651, when Charles was marching on Worcester, he preached before the judges at Conway, and manifested such strong royalist tendencies that he saved himself only by flight.
Return to Ireland.
He made various attempts to get his "Great Antichrist" printed, but could find no one bold enough to venture on it. In 1660, while crossing to Ireland, he heard at Holyhead the news of the Restoration, and the next morning, preaching in Dublin at St. Bride's, was the first in Ireland to pray publicly for the king. He further celebrated the event by the publication of his " 'O' Αντιχριστός, the Great Antichrist revealed" (London, 1660, fol.), in which he triumphantly showed antichrist to be "neither pope nor Turk," but the Westminster Assembly, whom he characterised in the title as a "collected pack or multitude of hypocritical, heretical, blasphemous, and most scandalous wicked men, that have fulfilled all the prophesies of the Scripture, which have forespoken of the coming of the great Antichrist."
On repairing to his diocese he found his palace and cathedral in ruins, and was immediately involved in numerous lawsuits in his endeavours to recover the alienated lands of the see, in which he was generally unsuccessful. In 1664 he published "The Persecution and Oppression of John Bale, Bishop of Ossory, and of Griffith Williams, that was called to the same Bishopric" (London, 4to), an animated autobiography, to which he appended a description of the distressed condition of the clergy of his diocese. Some statements in the appendix drew down the censure of the upper house of convocation at Dublin, and he was reduced to plead that they had inadvertently slipped in. He spent considerable sums in restoring his cathedral and repairing the damage wrought by the rebels.
For some years he held the prebendary of Mayne in his diocese "in commendam", exchanging it on 21 Feb. 1671-2 for the precentorship, which, however, he resigned on 14 March. Rumours of his death were rife in 1671, but he died on 29 March 1672, and was buried in his cathedral at Kilkenny. He left property to endow almshouses for eight poor widows to be erected in the churchyard of the cathedral, and also bequeathed his lands in Llanllechid for the benefit of the poor. Both his successors had some degree of connection with the Bangor area of Wales.
Marriage.
By his wife Anne he left issue. He was not always on good terms with her, and in October 1635 she brought a suit for alimony against him in the court of high commission, but the case terminated in a reconciliation.
Works.
Besides the works already mentioned, Williams was the author of:
To him also has been ascribed "An Examination of such Particulars in the Solemne League and Covenant as concern the Law; proving it to be destructive of the Lawes of England, both Ancient and Moderne", Oxford, 1644, 4to.

An Acoustic Control Induction System switches the length of the intake tract in two stages, based on rpm and throttle angle, thereby ensuring strong torque across a broad engine speed range. New tumble control valves enhances combustion while the engine is cold, and helps to bring the catalytic converters up to working temperature quickly. The Tumble control valves, along with new 12-hole high atomizing long-nozzle fuel injectors, reduce the amount of fuel adhering to the intake ports and therefore maximize fuel economy and reduce harmful emissions.
The cylinder block is an open-deck, midi-skirt type with cast-in iron liners and a die-cast aluminium lower crankcase and a stamped oil pan. The forged steel crankshaft is fully balanced with eight counterweights and supported by five main bearings. A helical gear pressed in No. 3 counterweight drives twin contra-rotating balance shafts in the shaft housing within the lower crankcase.
The AR engine replaces the AZ engine.

A 2.5 L version of the AR family, first released in the RAV4 in the U.S. and Canada in 2008. This engine also replaced the 2AZ-FE in the U.S. and Canada Camry in early 2009, giving 11% better fuel economy.
The engine service mass is 324 lb (147 kg) that includes the oil and coolant fully filled.
The engine is used in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
Applications:
2AR-FXE.
The 2AR-FXE is an Atkinson cycle variant of the 2AR-FE. It has the same bore and stroke, but the cams and pistons are unique.
The large valve overlap leads to a reduction in cylinder charge and reduced torque and power output, but efficiency is increased. This combination makes the 2AR-FXE suitable for use in hybrid vehicles, where peak torque and power demands can be met by the electric motor and battery.
Maximum output when used in the Camry hybrid is 154 hp with 153 lb·ft of torque which doesn't include the additional power of the electric motor that is used in the Camry Hybrid.
Applications:

Korea Aerospace University

Korea Aerospace University(한국항공대학교 (韓國航空大學校) Hang-gong Dae-hak-gyo) is a private research university, located in Goyang City, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. Established in 1952 as a national university, it was taken over by Jungseok Foundation established by Hanjin Group and transferred to a private university. 
Korea Aerospace University is the one and only university in Korea specialized in aviation and aerospace where mostly fostering high skilled experts for its research institute, airlines, airports, government agencies, and other leading companies.
The university, where encompasses most of the aerospace fields including Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering, Electronics • Telecommunication • Computer Engineering, Air Transportation and Logistics, and Aeronautical Science & Flight Operation, and Air and Space Law, has been designated to take several national undertakings and collaborative research projects with prominent global corporations including GE, Airbus, PLANSEE since 2009.
Outstanding research results have been also observed in the realm of unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV), since the first autonomous formation flight of UAV and the first flight of solar powered UAV for 12 consecutive hours in Korea. ‘The 1st Hannuri’, the micro satellite(CubeSat), was developed and launched for the first time among the Korean universities in 2006.
History.
Beginnings(1950’s~1960’s).
Korea Aerospace University was established as a national school in June 16, 1952, when the Korean War was raged, under the Charter for Transport School which was granted by the Ministry of Transportation(which is now Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs) in order to develop civil aviation industry. Although the university primarily started as a 2-year course school solely with three departments - Department of Flight Operation, Department of Aircraft Power, Department of Telecommunication Engineering - its status had been elevated by 1953.
After the War, the campus moved to Seoul in 1962, then to Goyang City, Gyeonggi-do in 1963, where it is currently located. School buildings started to build - the Hangar, the Flight Training Center, and the Electronics & Telecommunication Building – and several institutes – the Central Library, the Maintenance Factory, the Wireless Lab, the Aviation Research Institute, the Training School for Aviation Tech – were also opened.
Strengthened(1970’s~1990’s).
In 1979, the university was taken over by Jungseok Foundation, established by Hanjin Group, and it was transferred to a private university. Ever since the transformation, the university started to strengthen its inner and outer side of it.
Through the modifications on quota and name, establishment of schools, departments, and graduate schools were finalized. Auxiliary organizations and institutes were also reorganized(see “3.3 Centers and Institutes”) to vitalize its inner strength.
For the later, buildings and centers were built. While the Liberal Arts Building, Central Library, the Aviation Control Center, the Mechanical Engineering Building, and the Flight Operation Building were opened in 1970’s, the Student’s Hall, the Science Building, the Mechanical Engineering Building, the Electronic Engineering Building were constructed in 1990’s. Most of the current structures are definitely completed through this period.
Development(2000’s~ ).
Passing through the strengthening period, the university started to focus on ensuring its internal stability. From the early 2000s, structures were added and expanded to complement the existing buildings. The Central Library, the Center for Technical Assiatance to Small and Medium sized Industires, the KAU Aerospace Center/Museum, and the New Administrative Building were built, and the Library and the Student’s Hall had a level extension.
Since the university officially changed its name from Hankuk Aviation University to Korea Aerospace University in 2007, it started to develop its competence by expanding the international networks. Commenced by obtaining AABI(Aviation Accreditation Board International) qualification, for flight education, aviation management, air traffic management, and air transportation systems in 2007, MOU’s (Memorandum of Understanding) and agreements with well-known organizations were concluded: MOUs with University of Southern California, Drexel University, Oregon State University; Agreement for Cooperation with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University; Joint Development Agreement with General Electric.
60th Anniversary & Vision 2020.
In order to greet 60th Anniversary for the school foundation in 2012, Korea Aerospace University declared ‘KAU Vision 2020’ as its long-term development plan. The vision aims at the global first-tier university in aerospace education and research with 3 goals and 15 strategies. Its goals are 1) offering multifaceted education to foster global leaders in aviation and aerospace, 2) conducting advanced research that will lead to strengthening the global competitiveness of the nation, and 3) being a managerial organization capable of effectively resolving any internal or external administrative. With the vision, the university will be continuously advancing and conjoining the field of aerospace with other various academic fields.

Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area

Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area is a public park and nature reserve between the Columbia Slough and the Columbia River in Portland, Oregon. At about , it is one of the largest urban freshwater wetlands in the United States. Metro, the regional government for the Oregon part of the Portland metropolitan area, manages the park. A covered shelter, restrooms, a paved walkway, and a canoe launch lie on the north side of the natural area.
Although surrounded by port terminals, warehouses, and commercial areas, Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area provides habitat for a wide variety of wildlife including beaver, Bald Eagles and Western painted turtles. An artificial water-control system helps keep the wetlands wet. Other systems collect methane and prevent leaching from a closed landfill near the south edge of the park. 
Access and amenities.
The park includes restrooms, interpretive displays, a covered shelter, parking for 40 cars, a bus drop-off, and public art, all near North Marine Drive, which skirts the north edge of the wetland. The parking lot is about west of the Delta Park – Marine Drive West exit from Interstate 5. A paved, wheelchair-accessible path called the Interlakes Trail leads from the parking lot to two wildlife viewing platforms between the lakes. Boaters in non-motorized craft can use the park's canoe-launch to enter the lakes for recreation, wildlife viewing, or fishing for non-native species. Bicyclists and walkers can reach the park via a bicycle path, which runs along North Marine Drive and is part of the Portland metropolitan area's system of greenway trails known as the 40 Mile Loop.
Vegetation and wildlife.
Cottonwood, Oregon ash, alder, big leaf maple, willows, and shrubs grow in the park's forests. Some of the ash trees are more than 100 years old. Swamps include willow thickets, red-osier dogwoods, spiraea, and other small shrubs. Sedges, rushes, beggars tick, rice cutgrass, and reed canary grass grow in open meadows. Aquatic plants such as pond lilies, duckweed, and algae flourish in the sloughs and ponds.
The wide variety of mammals inhabiting the park include beaver, nutria, river otter, cottontail rabbit, raccoon, muskrat, mule deer, mink, and coyote. The only reptiles found at the lakes are garter snakes and turtles, including more than 200 Western painted turtles, listed as a sensitive-critical species by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. This listing means that unless the turtles reverse the downward trend in their population, the species could become listed as threatened or endangered. Amphibians include salamanders and frogs such as the Pacific chorus frog and the non-native bullfrog. Non-native fish introduced to the lakes include largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill, and carp.
Most species of waterbirds and migrant songbirds in the region visit the park. Birds observed in the wetlands include Bald Eagles, House Wrens, Yellow Warblers, Red-eyed Vireos, Goldfinches, Great Horned Owls, Red-tailed Hawks, Great Egrets, and Double-crested Cormorants, as many as a thousand at a time.
Restoration projects.
Historically, the wetland lay in the floodplain of the Columbia and Willamette rivers, and seasonal floods inundated the area. Development, including dredging, piping, and levees to prevent flooding drastically changed the area's hydrology. In 2003, to help restore historic hydrologic cycles in the wetland, Ducks Unlimited installed a water-control structure at Bybee Lake. Metro uses it to hold as much water as possible in the lake during winter and spring. This improves habitat for waterfowl and young salmon and inhibits reed canary grass, an invasive plant. In June, after the salmon have migrated to the ocean, Metro opens the structure. Until it closes the structure again, water from the Columbia Slough, which is affected by semidiurnal tides and to which Bybee Lake is connected, flows into and out of the lake.
South of Bybee Lake the park extends to the former St. Johns Landfill, which served as the region’s main garbage-disposal site from 1940 to 1991. Although most of the garbage at the site came from households, between 1958 and 1962 some came from a pesticide-manufacturing plant. Metro took over the landfill from the City of Portland in 1990 and by 1996 had completed a $36 million cover system to keep contaminants from leaching into the surrounding soil and water. Another system collects methane gas from beneath the cover and pipes it to a nearby cement company to use as fuel.

The first USS "Rehoboth" (SP-384) was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission in 1917.
"Rehoboth" was built in 1912 as a fishing vessel by W. G. Abbott, Milford, Delaware. The U.S. Navy acquired her from W. C. Lofland of Lewes, Delaware, for service during World War I, armed her, designated her SP-384, and commissioned her at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 12 May 1917, with Lieutenant, junior grade W. M. Bertrand, USNRF, in command.
Acquired originally for section patrol duty, "Rehoboth" was designated for distant service in June 1917, and on 14 August 1917 headed for Boston, Massachusetts. At the end of August 1917, she continued on across the Atlantic Ocean. Steaming via the Azores, she reached Brest, France on 18 September and began operations as a unit of Division 12, Patrol Force.
On 4 October, while "Rehoboth" was on escort duty, her hull began to leak. Her crew — unable to control the flooding — was taken off, and she was sunk by the British light cruiser .

Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Vol. 4

"Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4" is a two-disc compilation of twenty-eight American folk recordings originally released on 78 rpm records between 1927 and 1940, issued in May 2000 on Revenant Records, catalogue #211. Compiled by experimental filmmaker and notable eccentric Harry Smith as the fourth album of his "Anthology of American Folk Music" set from 1952, it was never completed by Smith himself. As of October 2010 it is out of print.
Contents.
The original anthology jump-started the folk music revival of the 1950s. In 1972, Moses Asch, interviewed by "Sing Out!" magazine, claimed that tapes for two additional volumes of the project had survived, although the documentation necessary to make a meaningful release of the volumes had been lost. Revenant Records worked with the Harry Smith Archive to recreate and release the fourth volume, associated by Smith with the classical element of earth. The extensive liner notes presented in a hardcover book were written by Dick Spottswood and John Fahey.
Unlike the first set, Smith did not choose the selections for this set strictly from between "1927, when electronic recording made possible accurate music reproduction, and 1932, when the Depression halted folk music sales." As a companion to his three two-album volumes from the original "Anthology of American Folk Music" categorized by Ballads, Social Music, and Songs, Smith chose "Labor Songs" as this volume's organizing principle. Smith included material released as late as 1940, with a selection of union songs making their first appearances for an Anthology set.
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, critic Richie Unterberger wrote of the album "It does differ from the first three volumes in its focus on a slightly later period, with all the tracks culled from the years 1928–1940. Lead Belly, Robert Johnson, Joe Williams, Bukka White, Memphis Minnie, and John Estes are all major blues artists; the Monroe Brothers, the Carter Family, Uncle Dave Macon, and the Blue Sky Boys all giant country/bluegrass pioneers; and the Hackberry Ramblers are one of the pre-eminent Cajun groups. A few of these songs are archetypes that have burned their way into the American collective musical consciousness: John Estes' "Milk Cow Blues," the Carter Family's "No Depression in Heaven," Joe Williams' "Baby Please Don't Go," and the Monroe Brothers' "Nine Pound Hammer Is Too Heavy." Other less famous performances are quite intriguing... At 28 songs spread over two CDs, it's a little shorter than might be expected for a box set, though as compensation, it's enclosed in a pretty incredible 96-page liner-note-sized hardcover book with writing by Dick Spottswood and John Fahey."
In his The A.V. Club review, Joshua Klein wrote "Volume Four (Smith had originally promised six) is stylistically akin to the first three, with some of the artists from the earlier volumes making encore performances. As Spottswood notes, the two-disc set ignores several country developments, as well as the conspicuous invention of the electric guitar in the '30s. Fans can only hope that such key points of musical evolution will be displayed in future volumes, but as it stands, the 28 mostly Depression-era songs on Volume Four run the gamut from labor anthems to fiddle bands to ballads to blues to black gospel. It's another essential, timeless piece of the Americana puzzle, fitting nicely into the incomparable picture Smith painted."

Harris–Benedict equation

The Harris–Benedict equation (also called the Harris-Benedict principle) is a method used to estimate an individual's basal metabolic rate (BMR) and daily kilocalorie requirements. The estimated BMR value is multiplied by a number that corresponds to the individuals's activity level. The resulting number is the recommended daily kilocalorie intake to maintain current body weight. 
The Harris–Benedict equation may be used to assist weight loss — by reducing the kilocalorie intake to a number below the estimated maintenance intake of the equation.
Step 1 – calculating the BMR.
The original Harris–Benedict equations published in 1918 and 1919.
The Harris–Benedict equations revised by Roza and Shizgal in 1984.
Step 2 – applying the Harris-Benedict Principle.
The following table enables calculation of an individual's recommended daily kilocalorie intake to maintain current weight.
Applications for weight loss.
Using the formulae above, a 24-year-old, 80 kg male who is 180 cm would have a BMR of 1900. If he exercised moderately, he would multiply his BMR by his activity level (1900 x 1.55) to determine daily kilocalorie requirements, which would be 2945 kcal per day to "keep" his weight at 80 kg. This may seem like a high kilocalorie intake, but his activity level requires it. This individual would exercise normally but not lose weight. The same individual without the exercise routine would only be able to consume 2273 kcal per day without gaining weight. The US Department of Health and Human Services Daily Value Guidelines provides figures that support the above example.
Using the Harris-Benedict Equation, individuals can take a mathematical approach to weight loss. There are 3500 kilocalories in 1 lb (0.45 kg) of body fat. Using the Harris-Benedict Principle, if someone has a daily allowance of 2500 kilocalories, but he reduces his intake to 2000, then the calculations show a one pound loss every 7 days.
History.
The Harris–Benedict equation sprang from a study by James Arthur Harris and Francis Gano Benedict, which was published in 1919 by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the monograph “A Biometric Study Of Basal Metabolism In Man”.

Come Sing, Jimmy Jo

Come Sing, Jimmy Jo is a 1985 children's novel written by U.S. novelist Katherine Paterson. The book focuses on a West Virginia boy named James Johnson, whose parents are bluegrass music performers. When it is discovered that James has previously unrecognized musical talent, his parents force him to take the stage name "Jimmy Jo" and perform with them. But problems arise when it becomes evident that the child’s talents are greater than those of his parents, which creates strain for both the adults (particularly the jealous mother) and the emotionally conflicted boy.
"Come Sing, Jimmy Jo" has been adapted into a musical play by David Paterson, the son of Katherine Paterson, with a score by Mark J. Thomas. The play has been performed by regional theater companies around the U.S.

Chalk Cliffs on Rügen

() is an oil painting of circa 1818 by the German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich.
Development.
In January 1818, Caspar David Friedrich married Christiane Caroline Bommer, who was about 20 years his junior. On their honeymoon in July and August 1818, they visited relatives in Neubrandenburg and Greifswald. From there, the couple undertook an excursion to the island of Rügen with Friedrich's brother Christian. The painting appears as a celebration of the couple's union.
Description.
The painting depicts the view from the chalk cliffs of the Stubbenkammer, at that time one of the most famous lookout points on the island. It is frequently but incorrectly believed that the "Wissower Klinken" outcrops in particular were a model for the painting; however, these did not exist at the time of the painting's creation, but appeared later because of erosion. Friedrich often composed his landscapes from carefully chosen elements of different sketches, so that a specific location is not necessarily discernible.
Two trees, whose leaves cover the upper third of the painting, frame the scenery. Two men and a woman in town clothes gaze in wonder at the view. The thin figure in the middle is usually interpreted as Caspar David Friedrich himself. His hat lies beside him as a sign of humility. He seeks for a foothold in the grass as a symbol of the transience of life and looks into the abyss opening before him—the abyss of death. On the right, the man with crossed arms leans against the trunk of a dying tree and looks far out to the sea. The two tiny sailboats stand as symbols for the soul which opens to eternal life and correspond to the figures of the two men. On the left, the woman in a red dress (who is usually identified as Friedrich's wife Caroline) sits beside an almost dried-up shrub: only the twigs around her face are leafing out. With her right hand she points either at the abyss or at the flowers bordering it. In contrast to the men, who gaze either at the abyss or into the distance, she communicates with the other figures—whether she feels threatened by the abyss or compelled by the natural beauty is unclear.
The colors of the figure's clothes are also symbolic. The middle figure is blue, the color of faith; the left figure is red, that of love; and the right figure is green, that of hope. Thus they can be interpreted as embodiments of the three Christian theological virtues: faith, hope and love. The art historian Helmut Börsch-Supan sees in the picture a representation of Friedrich's relation to death, and the threat to life by death: "clear [...] as almost never before, but at the same time also in an unusually serene mood".

Same-sex marriage in Nepal

Same-sex marriage is not recognized or performed in Nepal. In 2011 and 2012, the nation was undergoing a transition and attempted to add inclusive language into a newly drafted Constitution. However, negotiations among political factions failed in the spring of 2012 and the implementation of the interim constitution was placed on hold until new elections were to be held.
History.
On November 17, 2008, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled in favor of laws to guarantee full rights to LGBT people, and all gender minorities must be defined as “natural persons” under the law; this included the right to marry. "This is a landmark decision for the sexual minorities and we welcome it," said Sunil Babu Pant, Nepal's first publicly gay lawmaker and a leading gay rights activist in South Asia. The court asked the government to form a committee to study same sex partnership laws in other countries and mandated that the new law not discriminate against sexual minorities, including cross-dressing and transgendered people. 
On March 22, 2009, Pant said in an interview with the Indo-Asian News Service that "Though the court has approved of same sex marriage, the government is yet to enact a law," signaling that while a same-sex marriage bill has been ordered by the Supreme Court, it has yet to be drafted or voted on, much less legislated. In June, 2009, Pant said the process has just started. “Nepal is going through transition and everything seems to move slowly. The seven-member committee has formed and just started working to study same-sex marriage bills in other countries. Hopefully they will draft the suggestion to make same-sex marriage law soon and give it to the Government to approve.” 
Several sources are reporting that same-sex marriage and protections for sexual minorities will be included in the new Nepalese constitution being drafted.
Nepal currently has the Interim Constitution. The Interim Constitution provides for a Constituent Assembly, which is charged with writing Nepal's permanent constitution. The CA is now in the process of preparing its first draft. Under the terms of the Interim Constitution, the new constitution was to be promulgated by November 30, 2011, but a final six month extension was granted just before this deadline bringing the date to May 31, 2012.
Negotiations on the new constitution failed and the Prime Minister dissolved the Constituent Assembly on May 28, 2012 in preparations for new elections. As a result, the future of same-sex marriage is uncertain.
Constituent Assembly elections were held on 19 November 2013. The vote was repeatedly delayed, having previously been planned for 22 November 2012 following the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly on 27 May 2012, but it was put off by the election commission. On 10 February 2014 Sushil Koirala was elected as prime minister with a large majority, breaking the political deadlock and opening the way the for the constitution to be finalised.

Out Here Like This is a jazz album released in 1987. It was the second album by the all-star jazz group The Leaders and the first to be released on the Italian Black Saint label. The album features performances by Lester Bowie, Chico Freeman, Arthur Blythe, Cecil McBee, Kirk Lightsey and Don Moye. 
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott yanow awarded the album 4 stars stating "The all-star band accurately called the Leaders developed its own group sound. Performing inside/outside music, the band's Black Saint release features originals by Freeman, Lightsey, McBee, and Bowie, plus an obscurity. The trumpeter's straight-ahead "Zero" is a high point, and all of the musicians play up to their potential. It is particularly interesting to hear Bowie and Blythe excel in this fairly conservative (for them) setting".

EBICAB

EBICAB is a trade mark registered by Bombardier for the equipment on board a train used as a part of an Automatic Train Control system. EBICAB was originally derived from Ericsson's SLR system in Sweden. Most trains in Sweden and Norway use a similar on-board system, Ansaldo L10000 (more known as ATC-2) from Bombardiers competitor Ansaldo. ATC-2 was also developed in Sweden. 
These on-board systems use pairs of balises mounted on the sleepers. The pairs of balises distinguish signals in one direction from the other direction with semicontinuous speed supervision, using a wayside to train punctual transmission using wayside transponders.
Versions.
EBICAB comes in two versions, EBICAB 700 in Sweden, Norway, Portugal and Bulgaria and EBICAB 900 installed in the Mediterranean Corridor (vmax= 220 km/h). The EBICAB 900 is also used in Finland under the name ATP-VR/RHK. In Portugal it is known as Convel (the contraction of Controlo de Velocidade, meaning Speed Control).
The EBICAB 900 system uses wayside transponders (also called balises) with signal encoders or series communications with electronic lookup table, and on-board equipment on the train. The transmission of data occurs between the passive wayside transponders (between 2 to 4 per signal) and the antenna installed under the train, which powers the transponders when it passes over the transponder. The coupling between the transponder and the on-board antenna is inductive.
In comparison with ASFA, a system which transmits only a maximum amount of data per frequency, EBICAB uses electronic lookup table, the amount of data transmitted is much larger. 
Adif/Renfe, in Spain, sometimes use the term ATP to refer to EBICAB 900, which is the first system on its network to provide Automatic Train Protection.
EBICAB 700.
The most important difference with EBICAB 900, is that EBICAB 700 can only transmit packets with 12 useful bits for a total of 32bits and allows up to 5 transponders per signal.

<doc id="20304405" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20304405" title="Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project">
Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project

The Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project (LOIRP) is a project funded by NASA, SkyCorp Inc, SpaceRef Interactive, Inc., and private individuals to digitize the original analog data tapes from the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft that were sent to the Moon in 1966 and 1967.
Background.
The images taken by the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft were primarily used to locate landing sites for the manned Apollo missions. Once those missions were over, the data was largely forgotten since it had served its purpose. The original tapes were carefully archived for 20 years by the government in Maryland. When the tapes were released back to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, in 1986, the decision of whether to scrap the tapes became the responsibility of JPL archivist Nancy Evans. She decided that the tapes should be preserved. She recalled, "I could not morally get rid of this stuff".
Within a few years, Nancy Evans and a few colleagues were able to start a small project with funding from NASA. They managed to find four rare Ampex FR-900 tape drives—highly specialized drives that had only been used by government agencies such as the FAA, USAF, and NASA. (The FR-900's transport was adapted from the 2" Quadruplex videotape format, only in the FR-900's case, the drive was designed to record a wideband analog signal of any type for instrumentation or other purposes, rather than specifically a video signal as in 2" Quad's case.) Over time, Evan's team also collected documentation and spare parts for the tape drives from various government surplus sources. The project was successful at getting raw analog data from the tapes, but in order to generate the images, they discovered that they needed the specialized demodulation hardware that had been used by the Lunar Orbiter program, which no longer existed. They attempted to get funding from NASA and private sources to build the hardware, but were unsuccessful. Eventually, both Nancy Evans and Mark Nelson went on to other projects while the tape drives sat in Nancy Evans' garage.
In 2004, Philip Horzempa was doing research on the Lunar Orbiter program at the NASA History Office in Washington, D.C. In the archives, he happened to come across a memo from 1996 containing a proposal by Mark Nelson to digitize the Lunar Orbiter images, as described above. After about a year of searching, Horzempa was able to make contact with Mark Nelson. The two of them decided to restart the Lunar Orbiter tape recovery effort and find funding. They made contact with Jen Heldmann of NASA Ames.
In early 2007, Horzempa commented on the Lunar Orbiter tape recovery effort on a Web forum, NASASpaceflight.com. As a result, Dennis Wingo contacted Philip Horzempa through that forum. Horzempa put Wingo in contact with Nelson and Evans and invited Wingo to join the team. In addition to the tape drives mentioned above, Nelson had been able to obtain several tape heads. The tape drives were absolutely essential to any effort to read the original Lunar Orbiter data tapes.
Dennis Wingo is president of the aerospace engineering company SkyCorp and a long-time veteran of space and computing technologies. He knew he could muster the technical skills to tackle the management of renovating the tape drives, he could find contacts at NASA, and most importantly, he knew that the Moon was becoming a hot property again. Wingo said, "I knew the value of the tape drives and the tapes". Another group thought the same, writing, "future missions to the Moon have re-energized the lunar community and renewed interest in the Lunar Orbiter data".
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was set to go to the Moon in 2009, and one of its primary goals was to determine the risk to people working on the surface of the Moon. The LRO would create images of the surface that could be compared to the highest resolution images taken of the Moon during the Apollo era. The original Lunar Orbiter images are the highest resolution images of the Moon that had ever been taken until the LRO started taking images in the fall of 2009. The Lunar Orbiter images would be invaluable to scientists studying changes in the Moon's surface.
Expertise and facilities.
In February 2007 Dennis Wingo visited the four Ampex FR-900 tape drives for the first time in Nancy Evans' garage. Each drive was about tall, wide, as deep as a refrigerator, weighed and was coated with a thick layer of dust and cobwebs. They were stored with a pallet of manuals and schematics for the tape drives, along with hard copies of data related to the lunar images. Meanwhile, the tapes were stored safely in a climate-controlled warehouse. There were about 1,500 tapes, all packed into boxes, stacked four deep on pallets, and shrink-wrapped.
Dennis Wingo and Keith Cowing, a former NASA employee and President of SpaceRef Interactive, Inc. now served as co-leads the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project (LOIRP). Both Cowing and Wingo provided the funds required to get the project started. They spent about a year looking for funding, facilities, documentation and expertise. Dr. S. Pete Worden, NASA Ames Research Center Director, agreed to store the tape drives and tapes in unused warehouse space until funding and facilities could be found to begin the restoration project. In April 2007 NASA JPL released the tapes to the custody of Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. Nancy Evans also transferred ownership of the FR-900 drives to Wingo and Cowing. Wingo and Cowing rented two large trucks, loaded up the tape drives and documentation into one truck, and loaded the pallets of analog data tapes into the second truck. Cowing and Wingo then drove the trucks up to Mountain View, CA from Burbank, CA. The drives and tapes then sat in storage for the next year or so as funding for the project was sought.
Since the team required a facility with proper heating and cooling and a sink, available vacant buildings outside the gate at NASA Ames were whittled down to two: a barber shop, and a McDonald's that had closed weeks before. The barber shop was relatively small, so working there would require that the tapes be stored at a remote warehouse. On the other hand, the McDonald's was much larger, had good lighting, adequate power and air conditioning and excellent parking. It turned out to need some improvements in the electrical wiring. By July 2008, the team had moved into the McDonald's, (Building 596), now dubbed "McMoon's".
Wingo and Cowing quickly found expertise in the person of Ken Zin, an Army veteran who has a lifetime of experience in working with analog tape machines, including the FR-900 series. By coincidence, Zin's brother worked at NASA Ames Research Center and it is via this coincidence that Wingo and Cowing initially got in touch with Zin. With the assistance of Ken Davidian at NASA Headquarters funding was eventually obtained in 2008 for a pilot project to show that the drives could be repaired and that an image could be recovered from the original tapes. The first task was to methodically disassemble and clean the tape drives. Meanwhile, Ken Zin began testing the systems of the tape drives and making lists of devices to replace and refurbish. Parts for the drives were bought on eBay, online electronic parts stores, and other places.
Marketing and recruiting allies.
Dennis Wingo and Keith Cowing plunged into the management of the project: ordering parts, managing funds, searching surplus yards for equipment, researching refurbishing companies, and recruiting allies to the project. He began sending out an email newsletter, which was later converted to a blog, MoonViews.com, and posting photos to the project's Facebook page. Student interns from nearby San Jose State University were recruited and the team requested help from retired employees of Ampex and from blog writers with audiences that might be able to help. Every day there seemed to be a new visitor to McMoon's, such as Dr. Lisa Gaddis from the USGS project to digitize the Lunar Orbiter film, and Charlie Byrne, who wrote the memo recommending the Lunar Orbiter data be stored on magnetic tape. The project was reported in the "L.A. Times", "ComputerWorld", "National Geographic", the Associated Press, "American Libraries", the local news, and numerous blogs. Included in every news story was the message that the images are a vital piece of history, but more than this, they contain scientific data of a time and place and quality that has not been repeated. These are images that can assist in the current research about the Moon and the climate of the Earth. There may even be other lost data from the same era recorded using the same tape drives that could benefit from the efforts of the LOIRP team.
Media and metadata.
Shortly after moving into McMoon's, a group of students from the NASA Astrobiology Academy was recruited to remove all the tapes from the boxes, and put the tapes in order. Each tape takes about an hour to run on the tape drive, and holds one high-resolution image and one medium-resolution image. When archived in the early 1970s, each reel of tape was labeled, wrapped in a clear plastic bag, and enclosed in a mu-metal tin, and sealed with yellow plastic tape. Additional labels have been placed on the outside of the tape container. Each tape is labeled with a code that usually consists of two letters and two numbers, for example: MT_19, WT_45, and GT_46. One of the Astrobiology Academy students realized that the first letter indicated which ground station recorded the data on the tape in that container: "M" indicates that the tape was recorded in Madrid, Spain; "W" indicates that the tape was recorded in Woomera, Australia; and "G" indicates that the tape was recorded in Goldstone, California. This guess was confirmed when the team listened to the audio track at the beginning of a few of the tapes, wherein the operator of the ground station recites information about the tape and the recording. On tapes marked with an "M", the operator has a distinctly Latin accent. On tapes marked with a "W", the operator has a distinctly Australian accent. On tapes marked with a "G" the operator speaks with an American accent. Sometimes audio track captures an operator at one tracking station talking to an operator at another tracking station. Each tape's opening audio includes the date that the tape was recorded in both local and Universal Time.
There are many other confusing problems with the tapes. Each tape is supposed to hold a complete pair of images, but some contain just a few minutes of audio signal, and some contain the same tiny portion of an image, over and over. In the early stages of the project, the team wanted to rescue images that have the most value and impact, but they found that it was very time intensive to find images in this disordered array of tapes.
Hardware and funding.
In a completed and working magnetic tape drive system, the tape-drive heads apply a very specific magnetic field to the tape; the tape then induces a change in electrical current, which is captured. The data from the Lunar Orbiter tapes is then run through a demodulator, and through an analog-to-digital converter so that it can be fed into a computer for digital processing. Each image is divided up into strips on the tape, so the computer is used to bring the strips together to create a whole image. Before even beginning the project, the team evaluated the risks and determined that there were two: one was that the tapes had deteriorated to the point where they could not be read; the second was that the tape drives would not be able to read the tapes. The milestones of the project were developed to test these risks as soon as possible with the least amount of money spent.
Once the project started in earnest in July 2008, results came quickly. In only a couple of weeks, the first tape drive had been powered up, although it was clear that many parts still needed to be replaced. Another week of cleaning and testing revealed that among the four drives and batches of spare parts there were enough good power supplies to run one of the tape drives, and there was at least one working head for the drive. The head is the mechanism that touches the tape and reads and writes data, so it is absolutely critical; in the case of the Ampex FR-900 tape drives, the heads were not manufactured after 1974, cannot be replaced, and can only be refurbished at great expense by a single small company.
After another month of repairing and replacing parts, testing and tuning mechanisms, the project got the first solid result that the tapes were good. Each tape starts with a short standard-format audio clip of the operator, and the tape drives were able to read the audio signal. (Hear a sample of the audio.) This does not use the video heads that are needed to read the Lunar Orbiter data off the tape, but this demonstrated that the tapes had not deteriorated and that many of the sub-systems of the tape drive were in good working order.
The documentation for the tape drives was substantially incomplete, which kept the team from understanding the right way to repair, maintain, and use the tape drives. The search for documentation has been extensive and usually disappointing, as it often turns out that retired or elderly engineers have just recently cleaned out their garages. Posting to a blog, Dennis Wingo said, "I cannot tell you how many times we have heard similar stories of recently tossed manuals over the last six months". At just the right moment the team heard from a friend of a friend that a mother lode of maintenance documentation stored on aperture cards (microfilm embedded in computer punch cards) had been saved by the retired head of Ampex field engineering. This documentation would make it possible for the team to understand the correct procedures for repairing the tape drives and aligning the mechanics.
At this point in the restoration, the demodulation of the tapes had become the biggest issue. The team was not sure if the demodulation board that came with the system was the correct one, if they needed a different one, or if they needed this one and another one. At the same time, they discovered a tape, which, from the audio clip at the start, sounded as if it contained a demodulated recording of one of the images. This was a lucky break, as it meant that a demodulator would not be needed to generate images from this tape. If the team could rescue this image, the project would prove "that the drive can be refurbished to the point of reliably playing a tape back". Work continued, and the team coined the term "technoarchaeology" to describe the process of researching which tape contained what image. Posts to the blog continued, but with little substance until suddenly NASA announced a press conference.
On November 13, 2008 NASA held a press conference and announced that they were releasing the first image that had been restored: a striking image, taken on August 23, 1966, of the Earth as viewed, for the very first time, from the Moon. This was a major milestone that showed that the tapes and the tape drives were both good. Preliminary analysis showed that the image had "four times the dynamic range of the ... film image and up to twice the ultimate resolution". The NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) had sponsored the team so far with a small grant of $100,000. With these results, more funds were released—another $150,000 to complete a major restoration of the drives and to create the demodulation hardware needed for the other tapes. Gregory Schmidt, deputy director of the NASA Lunar Science Institute at Ames said, "Now that we've demonstrated the capability to retrieve images, our goal is to complete the tape drives' restoration and move toward retrieving all of the images on the remaining tapes".
Within a month, the next round of funding came through and restoration began in earnest. The heads, capstan and rotor motors were being restored by two different companies. New documentation about the demodulation was discovered, and the team began building a board by hand. Custom belts were being manufactured to replace the old ones. Software was being written to process the digital images. The biggest expense was the heads, which cost around $8,000 each to be refurbished.
On March 21, 2009, the team announced that they had rescued an un-demodulated image from one of the tapes, using the newly perfected demodulation system. The image, of the crater Copernicus, is from the Lunar Orbiter 2 spacecraft taken on November 24, 1966. NASA Scientist Martin Swetnick was quoted in a Time magazine article from 1966, calling this image "one of the great pictures of the century".
By April, the team had digitized 30 images. A couple of months later an article in ComputerWorld revealed that the project had a new grant of $600,000, and had hopes to completely digitize all the images by February 2010. Most of the new funding came from NASA, but about 10% came from other donors. This new funding allowed the team to restore a second tape drive to full operation by November 2009, which made the process of restoring the images that much faster.
Future preservation.
After each image is processed and restored, the data will be sent to the Planetary Data System (PDS), a digital repository for NASA mission and ground support data. The PDS was co-founded by Nancy Evans as a way to preserve and provide access to planetary datasets.
The Ampex FR-900 heads are refurbished by Videomagnetics Inc. of Colorado Springs, Colorado – the only company in the world that still refurbishes Ampex and RCA Quadruplex video heads.

USS Rehoboth (AVP-50)

The second USS "Rehoboth" (AVP-50/AGS-50) was in commission in the United States Navy as a seaplane tender from 1944 to 1947 and as an oceanographic survey ship from 1948 to 1970.
Construction, commissioning, and shakedown.
"Rehoboth" was laid down on 3 August 1942 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. She was launched on 8 November 1942, sponsored by Mrs. R. P. McConnell, and commissioned on 23 February 1944, with Commander Robert Crawford Warrack, Jr., in command.
World War II service.
"Rehoboth" was originally operated as a Barnegat-class seaplane tender. Following shakedown off San Diego, California, "Rehoboth" transited the Panama Canal on 25 April 1944 and reached Norfolk, Virginia, on 14 May 1944. On 17 May 1944 she sailed for Casablanca carrying men and cargo of Blimp Squadron 14. Returning to Norfolk on 9 June 1944, she carried cargo and personnel for Fleet Air Wing 7 in the United Kingdom from 8 July 1944 to 9 August 1944, then sailed south to Recife, Brazil, reporting to Commander, Fleet Air Wing 16, for duty on 31 August 1944. She transported passengers and cargo between various Brazilian ports until 15 January 1945, when she departed Natal, Brazil, for Bristol, England, carrying personnel and cargo for Commander, Fleet Air Wing 7. On 14 February 1945 she returned to Norfolk, whence, until mid-June 1945, she carried men and equipment to Bristol and Avonmouth in England.
Peacetime service 1945-1947.
"Rehoboth" retransited the Panama Canal on 18 August 1945, and after calls at San Diego and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, she arrived off Okinawa on 2 October 1945. There for two weeks she tended planes of Air-Sea Rescue Squadron 6 (VH-6), then steamed to Jinsen (now Incheon), Korea, where she took command of a seadrome and tended planes of Patrol Bombing Squadron 20 (VPB-20). In mid-November 1945 she crossed the Yellow Sea, and from 18 November 1945 to 21 December 1945 she tended a detachment of VH-6. On 25 December 1945 she arrived at Shanghai, China, to tend Air-Sea Rescue Squadron 1 (VH-1) and Patrol Bombing Squadron 25 (VPB-25) seaplanes. On 25 January 1946, "Rehoboth" got underway for Nagoya, Japan, thence proceeded to Kobe, Japan, on 17 February 1946, where she set up an auxiliary seadrome area. On 24 March 1946 she arrived at Sasebo, Japan, where she assumed seadrome control.
"Rehoboth" continued to serve in Japanese waters until August 1946 when she returned briefly to the Chinese coast, then operated off Australia and in the Philippines. In November 1946 she returned to Japan, whence she sailed east in 1947. Arriving at San Diego on 18 March 1947, she continued on, transited the Panama Canal at the end of March 1947, and reached Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 9 April 1947. She was decommissioned on 30 June 1947.
Oceanographic survey operations 1948-1970.
"Rehoboth" commenced conversion to an oceanographic survey ship in 1948. She recommissioned on 2 September 1948, and commenced oceanographic survey work under the direction of the Navy Hydrographic Office, predecessor of the Naval Oceanographic Office, being redesignated AGS-50 in August 1949. Equipped with a small laboratory and machinery to take Nansen casts, which provide the oceanographer with the temperature and samples of sea water at different depths, and to drill for core samples, she traveled over in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas during her first six years of operation.
In February 1952, while crossing the Atlantic, "Rehoboth" discovered and accurately positioned an underwater mountain range with heights up to 12,000 feet (3,658 m) above the ocean floor. In March 1952 she discovered and charted a 7,000-foot (2,134 m) undersea mountain near Bermuda and in August 1953 she became the first ship to anchor in over 2½ miles (4,023 m) of water.
Employed on special projects in 1953 and 1954, she returned to oceanographic survey work in the Atlantic and Caribbean in 1955.
Transferred to the Pacific in 1956, "Rehoboth" departed Philadelphia on 15 February 1956. Transiting the Panama Canal on 22 February 1956, she was diverted to an area northwest of the Galapagos Islands to search for the raft "Cantuta", which she found after four days. On 9 March 1956 "Rehoboth" reached San Francisco, and for the next year operated off the United States West Coast. On 4 March 1957 she proceeded to Pearl Harbor for three months of work in Hawaiian waters. For the next nine months she operated in the eastern Pacific. In April 1958 she extended her range to the Marshall Islands and in 1960 to the Western Pacific. In October 1960 she also added operations off the coast of South America. For the next four years her missions spanned the Pacific from equatorial to arctic climes.
In September 1965 "Rehoboth" completed operations in the northern Pacific and in November 1965 commenced survey operations in the South China Sea, conducting in December 1965 a hydrographic survey of the coast of South Vietnam from the Mekong Delta to Cape Padaran.
After completing survey operations in the South China Sea in February 1966, "Rehoboth" sailed east, arriving at San Francisco, California, on 23 March 1966. Overhaul and United States West Coast operations followed. In 1967 she conducted operations in the northern and western Pacific. In California waters from December 1967 until 14 March 1968, she then departed San Francisco for Yokosuka, Japan. She undertook survey operations in the Philippine Sea until August 1968, returning to San Francisco on 26 September 1968, where she remained for the balance of the year. She operated off the California coast in early 1969 until deploying to the Far East in August 1969, returning in December 1969 to San Francisco.
Final decommissioning and disposal.
"Rehoboth" again was decommissioned and was struck from the Navy List on 15 April 1970. She was sold for scrapping in September 1970.

Falkie Atoll

Falkie Atoll is a small atoll in the Solomon Islands, at . It is sometimes referred to as Van Ren Atoll, named after the Dutch explorer Jale Van Ren who discovered the atoll in 1679. Local name of this atoll is Kaka.
Administratively, Falkie Atoll belongs to the Choiseul Province of Solomon Islands. As an outlying part of the Solomon Islands, it is the westernmost atoll in the archipelago, 40 km northwest of Shortland Islands. However, the closest land is Papua New Guinea. Its total land area is 0.15 miles² (0.41 km²), but it encloses a lagoon of 2.7 miles² (7.3 km²). There are no permanent residents on the island, as freshwater is not available.
History.
The earliest written records of the atoll trace back to the early 18th century. In 1893 the atoll was annexed by Germany, and later ceded to Great Britain in 1899 along with the rest of the Solomon Islands. The atoll was briefly occupied prior to the Battle of Guadalcanal. in 1942 by the U.S. US Marines under the direction of Mj. Taylor King of the U.S. 5th Marine Regiment. The Japanese troops occupied the atoll during the Solomon Islands Campaign, and called the atoll "Keinain-shima".
After the Japanese removed their small garrison in 1943, the atoll was put under de facto control of Great Britain again. In 1978, the atoll became a part of the Solomon Islands.
